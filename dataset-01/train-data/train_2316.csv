5,Dive,"DiveWow! It was like the author was in my head when I was a teen. Stacey Donovan captures the thoughts, feelings and reality of being 15. She takes you from the intensity through the mundane weaving a beautiful deep character in V. Her life, loves and journey of self-awakening. This is a must read for teenage girls."
1,this is a weed,"I've been trying to get oxalis out of my garden for years. This is a WEED, impossible to kill, takes over everything."
4,Affordable bed cover,"This duvet did pill but we just use it to cover our blankets to avoid dirt and drool from our pats. Does the job! I wouldn't buy this to keep the bedroom looking nice but fine for everyday. The button-holes also broke after one wash, but again, it serves it's purpose for us."
5,I loved the book,it is all about the origins of the Yuuzhan vong and of Zonama Sekot a highly interesting book i am sad that i dont remember all the details but then again i have read so manny that i tend to forget where one book end and the other begins...Anyway if you enjoy star wars it is indeed a book i would recomend.fairly easy reading level.
2,It is time to put this series to an end......,"This book falls short of its promise of finally giving the details of this mysterious race that threatens to wipe out the New Republic and the Jedi's.Very little new is given and only hinted at. I am so frustrated by the way this has been stretched out with few of the books being well written.I feel trapped and have to read Book ""19"" to see how they conclude this unending ""drag"" of a story. This could have been told in a lot fewer books. Shame on them."
2,"Dry, boring. This entire series bored me to tears.",I had to read the series that covered the Vong war to know what happened but it was by far the most boring of all Star Wars novels I have read. All 19 books were almost painful to read. The battles were unnecessarily drawn out over multiple books and just weren't all that interesting.I would recommend the series be read by EU fans since a lot of main characters die or are transformed because of the war... but this series was really written poorly.
5,A Journey Worth Reading!,"I could not put ""Joyride: A Son's Unlikely Journey to His Mother's Heart"" down until I read it all.A story of a young man finding his mother again, thru her wonderfully funny and insightful stories she wrote each week about her family and friends in a column she called Joyride. She wrote hundreds of columns in her lifetime.The story of the journey takes you in; you experience all the emotional ups and downs. You are there with the family.There a very few writers that can transport you into their reality, and Craig Forrest does it very well.The book is a tale of truth, tragedy and hope, the inspirational journey of a young man.I highly recommend it!Ann Kane"
4,Not for cold winters,"I put this in my 99 Cherokee to keep it running cooler.It works great but I notice that because it opens sooner it takes longer to give you real hot heat from your heater.I would not use this if you live in a place with cold winters,it's fine for me,I live in Hawaii."
4,Worth the time and money!,An excellent CD that will not disappoint any music lover. It was by accident that I came across this album in my search for new music. This album is smooth and mellow with the sounds of the island.
2,Not an exciting version,"We found this book barely readable. I kept wanting to make myself read it and then dreading it. I will only read aloud books that I love and that are enjoyable to read. Maybe it was because I was trying to read it to a six-year-old, I don't know. The book was illustrated and the language had been simplified for children yet there were strange turns of phrase and vocabulary that I had to keep stopping to explain. We then read Gilgamesh: a verse narrative, which we thoroughly enjoyed, and never finished this one."
1,Chemical smell is overwhelming,"First let me state that I did not read this book. I assume that it is probably very good, unfortunately I could not get past the chemical smell. I'm surprised no one mentioned the nauseating stench.The book is printed in China and I have found other items printed there with the same smell. It is strong and smells very toxic. I'm assuming it is the ink colors or something, but whatever it is, it smells very bad and gave me a headache."
4,Amusing and accurate guide to federal income taxes,"Mary L. Sprouse writes guides to federal income tax that are the most amusing, and accurate too. Her annual tax books bear the Money logo. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find the 1997 version in bookstores. I hope she hasn't quit writing them."
5,Easy install and great lock,Just to clarify this is a panic lock. This means that a person on the inside of the room can never be locked in. It is not a defect but by design. We have this for safety reasons and it is very useful. He lock took 5 minsto install. Compared to the deadbolt I installed that is about 10 mins less time.The installation is straight foward and involved lining up the knobs when placed within the door cavity. If you have a unit that already does not turn then the mechanism maybe misaligned.Overall very good lock
4,It works!,No problems....works fine. But had to leave the plate off because the connection couldn't be made for the door to latch. However this could be because the door is not plumb anyway and it's an older home. It comes with choices in the plates you can use......I think it's a good door knob and better than the real cheapies.
5,Great Lock,First class lock at a reasonable price. I used these locks as a replacement for Kwik Set. No extra door fitting required.
2,Ball valves restrict flow- beware,"This is a really good idea that's flawed in execution. The small 3 way ball valves are not ""full port"" and the tiny holes really restrict the flow from the pump to the water heater and then from the water heater to the rest of the system. You're better off buying full port 3 way ball valves and making your own."
1,BAD PRODUCT,No matter wich way i turned the knob it didnt close the opposite side to bypass the hot water heater the knob was defective
5,Works just as well as non eco-friendly floss!,"Feels like a regular floss, works like a regular floss, doesn't have a strong of a taste as regular floss, but it leaves you just as clean as a regular floss. I'm really liking this stuff. I keep it in my purse and only use it on occasion since I have a Showerbreeze system, but it's great to have some in case of emergencies. Probably won't have to repurchase for a very long time, but if I run out, I will."
5,Flowering Trees,This book helped us learn what trees we have on our property. Also what to plant and not to plant. Great book for ones library. Always useful.
3,Trifold cards,"I need to know where I can purchase the cross stitch card holders...tri-fold, etc? If you can help, please send an email to lighthouse9150@yahoo.com."
2,"Am I Missing Something, or Is the Book Missing Something?","As the title suggests, I was hoping for a book with a thorough symbolic analysis of the connection between architecture (the design of elements in space; or the configuration of space) and music (the design of elements in time; or the configuration of [the experience of] time). Instead, this book offers some mostly affectatious studies on obscure ideas. If your goal is to find a book which presents ideas as of how to explore the architecture+music marriage, I personally would recommend you look elsewhere.Some of the projects are intriguing, granted, but perhaps I expected the kind of book which is yet to be written. In any event, this one was not worth the money."
5,Inspired me to change my major,"I picked this book up for some fun reading two years ago, and wow! Did I get more than I expected! As an educated individual I knew a lot about the new directions in contemprary music, and I often dreamed of uniting my love for physics and architecture with my musical talents. This book is a fascinating and well designed introduction to the kind of developments in contemporary architectural/musical circles. These projects discussed in PA-16 are some of the first of their kind, and something I am excited to follow up on in my own lifetime. And it's dedicated to John Cage! I reccommend this book to anyone who is at all curious about architecture or contemporary music. It is always refreshing to learn about people who are pushing the boundaries of our imaginations, whatever the topic.""New music will be answered by the new architecture- work we have not yet seen --only heard."" (John Cage)."
2,A book needs a book !!!!,"In the begginning i was impressed by the title but disappointed by the quality of its material besides the font is very bad and hard to read , very small sketches hard to see , and the ideas exploration is not accomplished ,so never start with this book for this subject ...."
5,The future of Web commerce,"Disregard any negative comments towards this book. Digital Capital is not an easy read for the newbie. However, anyone interested in understanding the future of Web commerce should read this book."
3,Interesting for the non technical type,"I was a bit disappointed while reading this book as it doesn't really address the needs of web application developpers working on cool projects. I feel it's mostly a book for those who haven't had any experience building e-communities and commecial web sites, a book for business people without a good grasp of the new economy. As a web devolopper, I am interested in any book that defines theories of what works, why and especially how.... An interesting book nonetheless, as it confirms certain strategies one may have envisioned already.."
4,among the best of its ilk,"Among the books offering advice on how businesses can forge an online presence, this is one of the more thoughtful, hands-on tries. The authors base their advice on the research they did into what they call 'business webs' which consist of a network of producers, service providers, suppliers, infrastructure companies, and customers that are all networked together through use of various digital channels. The authors find that there are five types of business webs, give examples for each of these, and give readers enough information that they might be able to model their own online business strategies on them."
5,Digital Capital: Harnessing the Power of Business Webs,Digital Capital articulates the characteristics of web based business models and illustrates how the application of these business models can rapidly change the status quo. Ample examples and quotations from business web innovators show the practicality of the models while the authors' framework offers guidelines to explore and examine business web opportunities. I can now better run and build my company's digital future.
1,Basura para niñas jevis babosas,"Escuchar ""La belleza está en tu interior"" (versión de ""To be with you"" de Mr. Big) ha sido uno de los momentos de mayor vergüenza ajena de mi vida. Coja usted una preciosa balada, cántela con voz de cursi baboso, llame a un par de amigas con el talento vocal de un cuervo graznando, y ponga la guinda con una letra vergonzante que parezca escrita por un guionista de ""Ana y los 7"". Qué pena de 3 minutos desperdiciados (lo siento, me vi incapaz de escucharla hasta el final). Resultaría hasta graciosa si no fuera porque el tipo la canta en serio. José, eres basura.P.D.: Por cierto, no he escuchado ninguna otra canción del disco ni pienso hacerlo. Un disco con esa canción merece ser condenado por los siglos de los siglos, independientemente de las demás canciones."
5,Great Chicken,This chicken is amazing. I cooked it at about 340* for 20 minutes and it came out perfect. My children loved it. The hard coating on the outside was a bit rough to get through but the amazing inner-copper veins of the chicken meat really tasted great. A good buy all around.
3,"Bought used, works good","We bought this 8150dn used. It works well (even with a $30 refurb cartridge). Tray 3 did not work, but the bypass 11x17 still works. For the price paid, we are satisfied."
1,Yikes..,"I was really excited to get this workout because of so many people raving about his live bootcamps, unfortunately this workout is a disaster. I actually didn't even finish the workout because it was so bad. It has no direction, and it's confusing. I workout hard 6 days a week, mostly to DVD's and this is by far the worst. After 20 minutes of ""cardio"" which is mostly getting up and down off the floor and sit ups, Jay rambles for probably three minutes. It was just bizarre. Then it went into some stretching, which is where I stopped it. This workout is just not for me. Too much stopping and starting and just standing around. Plus it was not engaging or fun in anyway. Do not get this workout if you have knee issues because the getting up and down off the floor was really hard on mine."
5,Excellent! Will Transport You From Limmeridge House to Blackwater Park and back again!,Very well done! Better than any movie could ever be. :) Highly recomended to anyone who enjoys Audiobooks. You do NOT want to pass this one up! It's one of my all time favorites and I've taken it on several road trips. You won't be sorry you bought this album!
2,Not for beginners!,The halting pace of this workout does not excite me. The bigger issue is absolutely no checking in on your form I've found in other products. Will not buy more of Jay's workouts. Save your money.
5,Helps you put a 77mm filter on a 67mm lens,"Not much to this review, but I have a bunch of nice Nikon pro lenses (like theNikon 17-55mm f/2.8G AF-S DXand theNikon 70-200mm f/2.8G VR II), and a few cheaper lenses I use for walkaround and when vacationing. So, instead of buying two sets of mediocre filters, I've purchased great B+W/Hoya filters at 77mm, and I simply screw this step-up ring into my cheaper walkaround lenses.Works great so far with the following lenses (that I've tested):Nikon 18-35mm AF Zoom,Nikon 18-105mm DX VR,Nikon 18-70mm DX."
3,67 to 77mm Step Up Ring,Good finish and fit. Hope the leading edge was beveled and serrated for ease of fitting and holding. Otherwise it could slip from the fingers and damage the lens or filter.
5,Awesome... Competes with the best ones around...,Awesome build and works great. I got this to replace an expensive B+W ring. This is almost a sixth of the price and still as good as it can get.
4,Helps you relax and enjoy your vacation,"The program starts up readily and is pretty intuitive to use. I found that just getting started and ""playing"" with it was fun, and that was basically all the training that I needed. It has countless links and information to help you surf the web and find all the information that you need for your next trip (tourism, sights to see, chamber of commerce, hotels, restaurants etc.). If you are REALLY organized then it allows you to put a schedule for the trip in a calendar that you can print out and take with you if your laptop is staying at home. Definitely worth considering if you are visiting new destinations in the US anytime soon."
1,Lies,"This is not leather! It is fake and of really poor quality. The material is horribly thin and flimsy. Smells like plastic, not leather. The only real thing from their ad is that it is black in colour."
3,Not for Large dogs!,"First let me begin by saying that this product is not an inferior one, my dog did seem to enjoy the bones. However, the bones are small and my dog had eaten 1 of them in about 30 minutes or less!I have a full grown male Boxer and these bones just aren't big enough. If you have a small dog, anywhere from a Pug to a Beagle you may be fine.I did see where the same company had 15' bones of the same type, I think I'll go that route. But like I said, my dog did seem to like them. Plus the delivery time was terrific and the price was very fair.The only reason I give this product 3 stars is because it is very misleading. When you see the word ""Mammoth"" you anticipate it being very large, it was not."
5,"A great album, full of great songs.","Chris Isaak's self titled album is one of my all time favorites. His voice, along with the band are in class by themselves. Songs like ""Lie to Me"", ""Heart Full of Soul"", and ""Blue Hotel"", are all songs that I think everyone will enjoy. I can listen to the whole cd at any given time, I don't have any particularly favorite song because I love the whole cd, buy it and enjoy."
5,Chris Isaak self titled CD,I have been a Isaak fan for yaers. The CD came and was worth the wait. His music is great to listen to. This one is but one of his CD's that someone new to his music will like.
4,Strong Entry,"I remember hearing ""Blue Hotel"" once or twice on the radio and being blown away by it, but it wasn't until a couple of years later that I started tracking down Chris Isaak's music. For my money, tracks 1-5 on the album are a great representation of his talent; a guy who can write songs and perform them with the melancholy of Orbison and the swagger of Elvis. The rest of the material is not quite as amazing, though by no means poor."
4,"Inserts, not press-in","I recently purchased a used Zx2, and wanted to make some improvements, one was improving the power transfer to the road, ergo the motor mount inserts. These do the job, there is noticable vibration transferred to me at idle now, but I don't have a proper baseline to know if these inserts contributed to that or not as the original mounts were rotten and were replaced at the same time.A note that may help insallation, is the item is called motor mounts, but on the ZX2, they are transmission mounts. Also, my mistake was thinking I had to take the original mounts and press the old rubber out and install these inserts. These simply are pushed in by hand to fit around the voids in the original rubber mounts."
1,Horrible Quality!!!,"Worst toy ever purchased... scratches, screws that cannot be tightened, terrible quality in every way."
1,Broken before it arrived!!,I ordered this for my son for his 3rd B-Day. It arrived and was immediately put away. A few weeks later I wrapped the box and my son opened it on his birthday only to find a broken guitar. The handle had completely broken from the base. Very poor quality!!!
1,No sweet music here...,"Rockin' Red Guitar, eh? Perhaps rockin' should ready ""rocky,"" as the plastic case is easily broken by any youngster... or oldster, for that matter. Additionally, this ""toy"" comes pre-stringed with some form of non-natural strings, supposedly nylon -- two of these non-gut strings broke when attempting to ellicit some music from the item. Definitely not for a young child! It probably wouldn't last for a half-hour under constant use by smaller folk."
2,"Missing parts when delivered, not very versatile.","When I opened the box and took this tool out, the strap fell off! One of the screws holding link between the handle and the strap was missing!Since I really wanted to get the bathtub faucet off without waiting for the whole Amazon return process, I got a bolt the same size and reattached the link. When I tried to take the faucet off, the wrench just spun around no matter how tightly I got the strap.Maybe this is fine for stuff that you could do by hand anyway (oil filters and the like) but on a chromed, tightly fit object, it's not useful at all."
1,Only gets one start because I can't give zero.,"Arrived with the screws that hold the straps on rolling around loose in the package. Both the strap and the handle broke within a couple minutes of use. Complete piece of junk, useless."
4,Little House On Rocky Ridge,"If you like history books then this is a good book for you. The book that I read is Little House On Rocky Ridge. If you read all the other Laura Ingalls series then you'll know what I'm talking about.You see Laura Ingalls is older with a husband and a daughter who is curius, and her name is Rose. So the 3 of them and their friends moved to Wisconsin but there is a problem not a big one but a minor one. They had a 100 dollar bill from when Laura's working at the sewing place but they lost it. Will they ever find the 100 dollar bill? But there's more problems! Read the book and you will find out all the problems. This is a real good history book you will love so read this good history book!"
2,Feels very artificial,"When I was a young girl and read the Little House books for the first time I had found a treasure. As soon as my children were old enough, I read the whole series to them. When I started to read the MacBride books in order to draw out the joy of the Little House series, I was disappointed at how artificial and contrived the stories seemed to be. It felt like the author was trying hard to sound like Laura Wilder and failed. Even my kids noticed the difference."
2,Don't let these books color your memories of Laura,"This series is a travesty. I understand the feeling of loss when you finish a beloved series, but let Laura, not MacBride, have the last word on her family's experience. So much in his books rings false: the clumsy historical allusions, the narrative voice, the potty humor . . . One of the greatest things about Laura Ingalls Wilder's work is the way her voice advances in maturity as she, the main character, grows: Big Woods is written for little girls and Happy Golden Years for young women. MacBride doesn't manage this and talks down to readers. There is a tiny thread of Laura in these books, but not enough to do more than frustrate her fans. Sampling is for rap, not fiction."
4,Good but........,This book was okay but I think the original LITTLE HOUSE books were better. But if Luara Ingalls Wilder or Rose Wilder Lane had written it I think it would have been better!
2,Comprehensive Reference Lacking Deeper Perspective,"This book will give you a printed version of the manual pages that come with the db distribution, the whole manual pages, and nothing but the manual pages. This in itself is a useful service if you (like me) prefer printed documentation over online documentation.However, I was disappointed by the fact that the book does not go beyond the manual pages by providing more complete programming examples. Also, I would have appreciated seeing some of the excellent academic papers that exist about the algorithmic underpinnings included in the book.As a final complaint, the book employs an increasingly popular binding style of using some sort of unsealed paper for binding. While I'm all for ecological packaging, I found that this style of binding (especially with a predominantly white cover) tends to take fingerprints and other smudges very easily, and makes it hard to remove them. As a result, the book starts looking ugly quite soon."
3,An important omission in the book and reviews too,I think it is important to know that the book documents version 3.
1,DONT BOTHER,"when i read this book, i had no idea on how to play bridge and was interested. this book is supposed to teach you how to play but all i read were many unfimilar terms that the author never explained.i know how to play bridge now and this book still makes no sense."
5,Step-by-step and easy,"Not to insult the other reviewer, but perhaps his problems with understanding the book are due to his language level. This is a really easy book to understand. It covers the basics of rubber contract bridge--play, scoring, etc."
1,Stay away!,"I will eat my hat if the author is even a life-master! This book will disgust expert bridge players, and confuse the heck out of beginners. This is a hodge-podge of bidding techniques left over from 4-card major days. If someone actually learns bridge from here, they will pick up really bad techniques and ""losing"" bridge. I doubt the author himself understands the subject very well. Stay away!!!"
4,KAPENA COLLECTION VOL.2,"I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS CD. THEY ARE A UNIQUE GROUP OF SINGERS THAT NOT ONLY SING WELL IN ENGLISH, BUT ALSO THE OTHER POLYNESIAN LANGUAGES (MAORI, SAMOAN, HAWAIIAN, AND TAHITIAN). I HOPE THEY CONTINUE TO PRODUCE MORE CD'S IN THE COMING YEARS. THIS IS A GREAT CD AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!!"
2,This product is obsolete,"If you're thinking about buying this product to update what was once a very expensive, first generation digital camera, DON'T DO IT. For what you'll pay for this item you can get a new digital camera. I know it was only ten years ago we bought our Mavicas but now THEY ARE OBSOLETE. I spent $130 getting all the things I need to keep this old camera working and I feel very foolish. Nothing about this product will ever enable me to get that money back. Put your Mavica in the attic. One day it will be a collector's item. Take the money you were planning to spend on this and buy a good smart phone. That will give you a better camera than your Mavica. Remember, you have been warned by someone who learned the hard way."
5,Beautiful southern homes--great design resource,"This book is highly recommended as a compendium of beautiful southern homes. The photos are not available online to view, but the book features many styles of Victorian homes and estates as well as some garden views of those homes. I purchased this book as a resource for 19th century mural work and decorative painting and it has been invaluable for that as well as for my library on Victorian style (although some of the interiors are intentionally eclectic and are not all true to period). The book features stained glass windows, woodwork, murals, inventive use of color, design, and original architecture. I never would have purchased the book if I had not seen a favorable review and photos in Victorian Homes mag, so I hope to do you the favor of endorsing the purchase for you. Very highly recommended."
5,Super scanner at a great price!,"This scanner was a breeze to set up and get going. The picture quality is great...photos scan in crisp and the color is dead-on. Also, it takes up less space than most other scanners I've seen."
2,$99.00 AND NO USB HOOKUP?,I guess maybe it was my own fault but I assumed all of the new scanners on the market included USB connections. This one is going back! This is probably an o.k. scanner but most computers offer USB connection for plug and play operation and find it pain to hook it up through my printer.
2,Not what I expected. . .,"I read all the reviews for this book, and thought it would be helpful. However, I think that this book was helpful for people who are beginning to explore a new relationship. I in no way think this book is helpful if you have been in a long term relationhip with someone, married, or especially when children are involved. I believe that she had some very valid points, however, to me it was ""common sense"". I think this would be ok for a teenager, but in a real complex realtionship, good luck."
3,Just okay,"This book didn't tell me any information I didn't already know, except for maybe the checklist to let me know whether or not I was a string along. The way I see it, if you're thinking about buying this book in the first place, you are probably a string along. You don't need a book to tell you that."
2,Much more applicable t women than to men!,In my opinion only the last 2 chapters are equally applicable to men and women. Would recommend this book to many women; not to men!Theo
1,Worst book I ever bought,"This was the absolute worst book I have ever purchased. First of all it is extremely small and poorly written. In order to fill up the small pages, many blank lines were inserted and the author repeats the same information numberous times where there is print. The information echos the rantings of a woman newly released from a bad relationship and discounts the feelings of all others. This is fit only for someone who really is ""the One"". That is, if they were the one and only person on the planet."
2,"your good enough, your smart enough, and people like you","A very short read which is why i'm guessing there are so many 5 star reviews. It should take you 30 minutes from start to finish.No substance to this book either. Your a strong, bright, attractive person. Good? That will be$9.99 please"
2,Stop being the string alone and being The One,"It was ok, I was honestly expecting a little bit more from all the reviews I read. But It wasn't expensive so I guess it was worth what I paid for it!"
4,If you find yoursef being strung along.....this book just might be the book for you.,"If you feel like you are being stringed along.....there are chances you are. This is a good book for women who are being naive of men or anyone using them for a service, no matter what it may be. It talks about ways you can recognize it are being strong along (which you may see already)and how to avoid them. Great to read....and pass on to another friend. Everyone is naive in some way."
2,"Boring, repetative","I've already read The Rules and The Bitch books. This book is more of the same but without the humor or writing skill of the previously mentioned books.It's boring and poorly written and I started skimming within 20 minutes. By the time 30 minutes had passed, I'd lost all interest and tossed it aside.While the ideas are good, they are not novel and the author shows no invoation in her treatment of the concepts or writing finesse.Also, way over priced @ $17. A waste of money."
5,No longer a string along!,"I absolutely loved this book. i was going through a crazy ""relationship"" at the time i ordered this book, and let's just say my eyes have been opened!"
5,This book saved me.,"I purchased this book because of the reviews it received. I have been trying to figure out the reason(s) for the bizarre behavior of the man I wasn't sure if I was dating (if that doesn't make sense, consider yourself lucky -- unfortunately, it makes perfect sense to The String Along). Was he passive-aggressive? Was he married? Living with someone? Playing the field? In the end, it didn't matter. What matters is that I read this book and was able to rationalize and even quantify his behavior. He received 8 scores on Reasons to Stay and 18 on Reasons to Leave with Skidmarks (when even 1 on the latter is enough to run fast!). The day after finishing this book, I left with skidmarks. It's still hurting, but this book helped me understand that, in spite of our strong chemistry, I was being strung along. Who knows how much longer I would have tolerated the hurtful behavior had I not read this book. I deserve better and so do you."
5,Excellent and Empowering,"Great answers, right to the point, and really empowering, Stop Being the String Along is timeless, with how to get out of pain answers. It shows you how to love yourself, and how to give and receive equally in a relationship instead of giving a lot and receiving little in return. It's the best relationship book I've ever read."
4,Easy to Read Self Help for the Single,"I read many of the the reviews for this book and saw how some other people loved or hated it.I am on the love side, because it's a very easy to read relationship guide, but still manages to be an excellent source because its to the point chapters on what you should want and have in a successful relationship for yourself.Even if you don't agree with all of her 50 lines in her list of ""The One"" it does give you something to think about.This book was useful to me, because it was more of thinking about what internally makes you happy and not ""oh he didn't call move on"".This book is about setting standards, boundaries and understanding what will make you happy so you don't have to worry about why he/she didn't call you.It's instead inspirational in its message, and is trying to tell you, there is someone out there if you look and know what to look for when you do."
5,Unveiled Misconceptions,"Not only is this book an interesting and insightful picture into John Weaver's experience, it also reveals the true motive behind so much of the work going on all over Central Asia. I am so grateful for John's gift of articulation and his committment to be honest and bold about the commission we have all been given--to use our blessings and resources to bless and help others in the world. This book is certainly not one meant only for religious readers! Definitly an important read for secular as well as Islamic background people. It gives insight into the heart of relief and community development work ... and it, more importantly, unveils the often misinterpreted heart of love and compassion that many Western aid workers have for peoples who are different than them!"
2,Up close and personal,"There should be 5 stars above, not 2. I have had the fortunate opportunity to meet John in Kabul, Afghanistan before I read his book. I am here for 6 months and wanted to read a book about Afghanistan and after hearing him speak on a Sunday night got his book from our camp Chaplain. I was coming back from a day out in the city and bumped in to him today and gave him a big hug! He is a great writer and loves to educate and fill in the gaps for people. By far the best part about him is his infectious love for Jesus."
5,"Great product, delivered on time and in promised condition","No scratches or other problems with the CD itself, the jewel case was in great condition (as promised) and the order was delivered quickly. Overall a great purchase experience!"
1,Nine lives she's got,"Every 70's artist should be allowed one bad album in the 80's. Bonnie Raitt used it up here and moved on to much greater things, eg Nick Of Time & the Grammys.First time on CD though, so it's great for fans."
2,Nine Lives,"I didn't pay close enough attention and didn't realize this was a remaster of Bonnie's 80's music. Was just excited to see anything new with the Raitt name on it, so I bought it immediately. Sadly, a mistake. It is a weak and lethargic recording, but you can get a sense of what she is building up to towards Luck of the Draw and Nick of Time. It is easy enough to listen to, but it just doesn't have the punch I expect from Bonnie. She spoiled me, probably, with her later work. Can't really recommend buying this one."
5,Nine Lives - Love it,"I think there is a bit of a reggae influence in some of the songs on this CD. I had the vinyl album years ago and am so glad to have the CD. It's one of my favorite Bonnie Raitt albums. From the other reviews, it is apparent you either love it or hate it. I don't understand how anyone could hate it. Some of my favorite songs on this album are ""Who But a Fool"", ""Runnin' Back to Me"" and ""Crime of Passion""."
1,Thank God the 80's are over,"Seriously disappointing record, unless overproduced sterile 80's rock is your thing. This album might rock, but it lacks the soulful feel of all of her other recordings. This is the one Bonnie record that I just find icky. Can't stand it. Thank God she didn't stay in this funk (and I use funk here negatively). If you don't like bland 80's rock, you will not like this album. I hate to say it but a star would be too much for this one. I do like all of her other albums; I just can't stand this one.oops, I guess it won't let me give it no stars. I'll give it one star for her voice. Her voice alone is worth at least one star I suppose, but the band still gets no stars from me."
4,singer,For in home studio recording this cord is great. No noise or interference through this cord. Great buy for the price.
5,Great deal for the price -- works as expected,The cable I received seems to be of good quality. It works fine with my karaoke amp.The price on Amazon was great compared to other cables of the same quality that I could find locally.
2,Synthesized sterility,"Aside from a few distinct passages, this comes encased in 80's production so densely plastic it hard to appreciate seldom segments that do gel. Davis obviously sought Miller's direction for late-career relevance but with Tutu vibrancy ended up backfiring."
2,Not what I'm used to.,I felt that the electronic instruments were not well integrated into the music. It felt forced and uninteresting. There also seemed to be a lack of verity that I would normally here from Davis' music. I was underwhelmed.
5,"a brillant pop jazz recording,","Unlike Miles's work in the 50's, 60's and 70's; 80's Miles Davis won't impress any of the jazz ""critiques"" (aka ""jazz snobs"").Tutu, is not innovative like Mile's 'birth of cool' in the 50's or his 'bitches brew' jazz rock in the late 60'sLikewise it does not have the brillant musicianship and arrangements in his 'kind of blue' or 'scetches of spain' period.What it is a brillant pop jazz recording that I wish I wish the Kenny Gs other the pop jazz artists would take note of, thus incorporate some kind of innovation and variety into their cds.Simply put, I can play 'Tutu' and other 80's Mile's work for anyone, except the afore-mentioned ""jazz snobs"", and listen to it myself alone as well.I have turned people on to jazz by playing such Miles' 80's work, who would be turned off jazz if I played the 'innovative' Miles' work for them.These people are now listening to Duke Ellington, Woody Herman, etc instead of Kenny G."
2,Waste of money,It's truly a waste of money. I will probably never listen to it again. One of those things an artist does simply for money. There's nothing of Miles genius in this. Boring.
2,Without a doubt the nadir of the career of Miles Davis.,"Bland synthesizer sonic tempos shift in and out of Miles excellent playing. The trouble with this album (and most of what he released in the 1980's ) is that his lines are wasted playing with such insipid textures. I love the electric fusion of the late 70's, but unfortunately this album really tarnishes his output. I would of have given this album 1 star if anyone else were playing the trumpet. This should not be a priority even if you are a completist."
3,uninspired,"""Tutu"" ranks as one of my least favorite of Miles works (though almost all of this 80s works fall in this category). From the moment I first heard it, the passion wasn't there; and even if Miles'lp's have nothing else, they are carried by his passion.I'm not saying to avoid this lp- try it, you might like it, but for me it fails miserably. I'm sorry, Miles."
2,Just going thru the Motions,this album was just going thru the motions very Uninspired Material.You would think with the Minds of George Duke&Marcus Miller that this would have Funkier&with more Adventure you would be wrong.this album never really kicks in.His Playing is really the only thing that Kinda saves it.and that isn't in it's strongest form either.and you can't go by no Grammys to Hear a Classic Album cuz Marvin Gaye's What's GOing On didn't win a Damn Thang but it is COnsidered a Must Have.The Awards were pay Back for his Grand Career cuz they never get it RIght that often.it happen this past year to Miles Buddy Carlos Santana who got all those awards with a Lame Album.so don't go by Award shows for Quality.this is not a Happening Album.
3,tutu...,"The best song on this album is the title song, Tutu. This album was published in the 1980s, which should tell you that the music is going to have a 1980s sound. What kind of sound is that? Well, except for the grandmaster's trumpet playing, the accompanying music sounds very synthethized. Synthesizers were popular in 1980s music, so that's how 99% of this album sounds, save Tutu. It just doesn't have that cool jazz sound that we are used to hearing from Miles. I highly recommend Kind of Blue instead of this album."
3,"Lightweight, but enjoyable","It took me a while to come round to late-era Miles Davis, but after buying the excellent Live Around The World, I felt `ready' for Tutu. People here seem to be making the mistake of trying to find what they like of the Kind of Blue-Miles in these later works, when they are best approached with a more open mind.While, for me, the On The Corner / Live Evil Miles is the period I most enjoy, I still found Tutu a satisfying experience. Though the backing is very much 'of the period', Miles's trumpet playing has much more in common with his playing in the late 1950s than of the work he'd done in the 1970s. His playing often sounds tired on the album, yet this balances well against the heavily synthesized backing tracks, adding a much-needed organic counter-balance.The mistake is to see this as any sort of jazz album: it's not. This is essentially a pop album, with the trumpet filling the role of a vocalist. The inclusion of Scritti Poltti's Perfect Way makes this very obvious."
5,French Island Elegance,"Transaction: Very smooth. Book arrived immediately. Next to no wait time. In EXCELLENT condition. One would never know the pages have been turned. Very pleased. Would highly recommend.The Book: Love, Love, Love it! French Island Elegance and style are captured beautifully in the photographs. Scenery is breath taking. Makes me wonder why I am sitting HERE and not THERE! I feel inspired. Time to bring a bit of island style to my space.Thank you"
2,Less is more.,John...I bought the book after a friend recommended it. The Unconscious Civilization was the last of your works I read and I recall very little.It was time to revisit you. You have a big reputation and I wanted to keep up.For me there were too many big words. And the ideas took a long time to gestate. It was on my Kindle and I found it difficult day after day.So I stopped reading it.I'm not very clever so I'm sure there are of lots of readers who loved it.
5,An Analysis that gives us a Future,"In spite of the potentially 'dry' subject matter, I found the style very readable, the exposition clear and logical, the subject well researched and the ideas exciting. A man not afraid of complexity or stating the obvious - our current state of free markets and globalisaation is not working there is less and less competition and the majority are slaves of tmarket uncertainty"
5,favorite wedding gift,"My husband and I received this as a wedding gift 13 years ago. We still use it a couple of times a month and really enjoy it. It does keep the wine cold and, I think, it's beautiful."
1,False Advertising!,"I specifically purchased this wine chiller as a gift, as the amazon.com website stated that the product was ""USA-Made."" Unfortunately, when I received the wine chiller, it had a ""MADE IN INDIA"" sticker on the box... not to mention a few dents. I am extremely disappointed with the false adversting from Amazon.com and do not think an India-made wine chiller is worth the $100 price tag."
3,HEY BUD...TUSCON IS SPELLED TUCSON,If your gonna write about our music...and send potshots our way too...at least spell it right T-U-C-S-O-N...now say it bud...TUCSON...and there is somethin in the water.
1,Another Shoddy Product!,"Reading some of the other reviews, perhaps I should not regret so much that this is yet another shoddy History Channel product without subtitles. It's not a theatrical production. It's narrated for goodness' sake. How can they manage NOT to subtitle these documentaries?"
2,Playing Barbarians,Viewers who object to the Caucasian actors in this series portraying Mongols should take a look at the classic whopper of the genre--John Wayne as Genghis Khan!
1,Glaring Inaccuracy,"The use of Caucasian actors to play Mongolians-especially Genghis Khan- has effectively discredited the History Channel as nothing more than mindless entertainment. If they are so careless about this obvious aspect of history, then what other lies are they tying to pass off as historical truth? This is no different than yellow-faced white actors in any horrid asian themed movies way back in those less ""progressive"" times. The Barbarian series should be categorized as dim-witted entertainment and not educational."
3,BAR BARS,This is a very informative history. Its worth purchasing for those who like a bit of history. It is worth the money. This has to be watched and re-watched in a timely fashion.
3,Barbarians 1,Same problem with History Channel videos---repeating the same scenes too often to eat up time. Historically I do like the references and the impact in modern history.
1,Unfortunate,"I just bought a Spanish Program to enhance my Spanish skills, so I needed a microphone to help me out with the program.Microphone is light, weak and doesn't do too much for me. I would prefer a more heavy duty mic for anything.Secondly, it doesn't work at all. I understand it is typically used for online chat and what have you but my comp doesn't even recognize it or hear anything when I speak to it.Obviously I'm not too upset because I paid a measily[...]bucks for it, but stay away from this mic anyway. It's not woth the [...]bucks.Overall quality is very poor as well."
2,Economy PC Mic Performs Respectably,"Although I ordered the white CyberAcoustics Desktop Mic-48 shown in the photo, the Dynex DX-54 (with a CyberAcoustics logo) was sent to me. Amazon needs to update the photo.The mic performs well and sounded more pleasant than a slightly more expensive USB desktop boom mic. I recommend this mic for general use, and feel Amazon's pricing is reasonable."
3,A little tech help for you,"Hi. I never used this microphone, but I may be interested in getting it. I'll try to help you make your microphone work so that you can give a real review.Step 1:Connect the microphone to the computer and make sure it is on if there is a switch.Step 2:Click Start>Control Panel.(If you have it in category view, click ""Sounds, Speech, and Audio Devices"" now.) Now click ""Sounds and Audio Devices"".Step 3:Click the Voice tab.Step 4:Under where it says ""Voice recording"", click ""Test hardware...""Step 5:Carefully follow the directions.You may also want to click ""Volume..."" under ""Voice recording"" to raise the volume of your microphone. (Also, make sure that after you do click ""Volume..."" the check box under microphone should be checked.)"
1,This thing doesn't work AT ALL,"I purchased this particular microphone from this site through TigerDirect, and wouldn't you know it----NO INSTRUCTIONS. I have tried to use various voice recording programs (WavePad, Sound Forge, and Cakewalk) but when I plug this mic in, NOTHING HAPPENS.Now, in the interest of fairness, I will not blame any one company for this problem, but I would really love to get some instructions for this product so that I can find out what it is that I need in order to make this product function. That is all I ask. That is why I rated it ""1 star""....there's no way I can tell if this product is truly defective or not. TigerDirect says it doesn't come with instructions, and that all I need to do is to plug it in and use whatever software I have. That obviously isn't going to help me at all.If someone has any instructions as to how to get this thing to work, please feel free to let me know."
5,Stormy,"Stormy is SOOOOOO CUTE even the model is cute. Did you know Stormy is the daughter of Misty togeter, their bondship is so sweet that it well even make the toughest person cry. Especially the ending of the book Stormy Misty's Foal."
4,Portable CD Player Case (SBP 2),"This product never leaves my side, I wonder how I did without so long!I""m unable to evaluate the sound Quality due to faulty headphones, however the user friendly features are outstanding, even though to increase the volume the construction of my CD player require unzipping! So i leave it halfway open, or set the volume once! Im satisfied with this product as it allows me the freedom of portability! Hope this Helps!"
4,How Can I Miss You When You Won't Go Away?,"Is that one of the best song titles ever? For years I thought of this album as being flatter sounding, less alive and full than the 'Where's the Money'lp that has several of these songs on it done live. Upon revisiting it about 20 years ago I realised this is another classic album. Sure, the production could have made the sound a bit more lively. But the songs, particularly 'How Can I Miss You...' and 'I Scare Myself' are so strong, even the less than jumpin' overall sound they attain on the live lp, that this album, their first, is still very much worth getting. Where else can you find this pure musical sound of violin/smarty pants lyrics/harmony/strong song writing/bluegrass/swing/hint 'o jazz/hint 'o rock combo? Nowhere. chrisbct@hotmail.com"
1,"Not ""ORIGINAL"" recordings","This CD sounds as if it's made up of out-takes or re-recordings of the Original Recordings on the LP version, which I've had for years, and is a dandy. I cannot recommend this at all."
2,Deceptive Title,"This is not the typical story of someone's inspiring,courageous life dealing with a serious medical problem.It is basically a philosophy book dealing with religion and the state of the world both past and present.We even get a lesson in Russian history.It can be tedious at times to comprehend his rambling thoughts.Despite this,I'm glad I read the book!At times,when he does talk about life,death or religion,he has some very fascinating and insightful thoughts which makes ploughing through the book worthwhile."
5,great cd,i've been looking for this cd because mary lou is on it.i gave it a 5 star rating because this cd is great and i reccomend everyone to buy cds from this store. they great.
3,Ack!,"I love the idea of this product. It is indeed one of the best breyers out there when it comes to detail. However I have yet to get this guy to stand. Matter of fact the the clear stand that he comes with broke off and is pretty much impossible to fix. This doesn't help with all the scratching. It's too bad breyers that can actually stand do not have this much detail. I wouldn't advise this one for children. I find it to be overly fragile, more so than other breyers."
5,Arabian or Not?,"I am a Breyer Collector, and this is one of my favorite pieces. Having a connection to this horse, it ment so much to me to be able to receive him. He is my most favorite, and most delicate. Having said that, I think he is in no way in any resemblance to an Arabian. He only slightly resembles the real Huckleberry Bey. This ""toy"" is educational because it talks about the past of a very famous horse.Getting away from the factual, I'd like to talk about the artistic. His mane is wonderful, and so is his tail, but they are a bit overdone. It does resemble a real pose of his, but the tail was solid, not in tid-bits of curls. He has a nice sheen to him though, giving him a soft glow in the right light. He's very hard to draw though, I am yet to master him -.-I don't reccomend him for [young] children, because his ears hurt, and are VERY sharp. He doesn't stand well, and without his plastic stand he is almost useless.Average age Reccomended: 12 and up"
2,Arab Stallion,This mold really does'nt look like Huckleberry bey it looks more like his son. since i've meet his son and i have many pictures of huckleberry bey. this mold looks more like a toy then a breyer also.
2,McCulloch Chipper/Shredder,"I thought it would be more powerful than it is. It does not chip as well as I had expected. Leaves go through without any shredding at all. It is neccessary to crush the dry debris as I feed it in. Even then, it has to be put through multiple times to get a consistency for mulch."
2,Needs modifications,"Once you get the groove, this machine is OK. Problem I encountered is funneling the stuff through. I had to cut out the safety flaps in order to get this to work."
3,blades dull quickly!,"I was able to assemble this item without much fanfare. I did one little pile of brush/leaves yesterday. Today when I went to do another little pile, the blades were so dull, the twigs just whirled around in the hopper, even pushing hard wouldn't cut it. I switched the blades around to use the other side and was able to get the 2nd pile done. Now I have a bunch of teeny piles that need to be done, however, the blades are so dull, the chipper is useless. I tried sharpening the blades like you do the lawn mower -- no luck. Be prepared to purchase lots of blades!"
1,Avoid this machine,"I found this machine to be unsatisfactory for shredding leaves and garden waste. The hopper has two slots for material, one for leaves that is too small, and another for twigs and branches. I had to force the leaves through the slot with a stick to get them into the hopper which was time consuming and allowed only a half a bucket of leaves at one time. Small leaves such as elm might flow through on their own. The twigs and flower stalks were hard to jam through the slots and they balled up inside the machine, again needing a stick to force them through to the cutter blades (definitely a safety concern). The blades dulled quickly. MTD (parent company of McCulloch) tech service was unresponsive."
1,Buy American,"I had a bad feeling when I saw the ""made in China"" sticker. I finally got the thing put together by throwing away the illegible, typo-and-error-ridden directions and looking at the picture on the box (fedder? What's a fedder?) Then I realized that the hopper was damaged. The people at McCullough suggested I leave it in the sun to help it straighten out! I was willing to try, but when I turned the unit on to test it, nothing happened. Nothing! So I returned it. Amazon immediately sent me a new one--which also had a damaged hopper, and incredibly, was also completely dead. I returned that one as well. Amazon refunded my money and reimbursed me for the shipping. My advice is to find a chipper that did not have to come to the U.S. in a shipping container."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"I waited patiently for this chipper to arrive. It came quickly, but wouldn't start. I tried plugging it into different outlets thinking that it couldn't come broken! Low and behold it started up, jammed then would not start again. Don't waste your money on this machine."
3,Not the best of this series,"Let's face it--Faith Fairchild is a much more interesting heroine than her friend Pix Miller. In this installment of ""The Body....."" books, Pix accompanies her mother on a trip to Norway. She has been summoned by her childhood friend, Marit Hansen whose daughter has disappeared after the death of her fiance. The theory is that since the two young people were tour guides, the group of women can join the tour and discover the culprits to the apparent murder/kidnapping. The best part of the book is the background of Norway with frequent references to the geography, climate, customs, and food of the country. Somehow this book doesn't come across as well as others of the series and it's hard to care about characters who are never fully developed."
2,"Disappointed, but Will Try Again","I agree with the reader from Canada. I found this book tedious and boring. There were simply too many people, too much chit chat, and too much tourist information. And if I want to buy a cookbook, I will do so. Now having said all of this, I have enjoyed other books in the series very much and so will continue reading. It is because I have liked the other books that I took the time to share my disappointment with this particular book."
3,Disappointing unfortunately,This book centers on Pix Miller character in Norway with her mother. The reason I enjoy this author is because of the Faith Fairchild character and to find this book with so little of that character is disappointing. I usually re-read many of my mystery novels and this is one I don't think I will. Faith is the most interesting character and to make her a minor character is to disappoint her many fans.
3,miss old illustrator,The story is great but it is really missing something with the new cartoon-like illustrations. The older edition has beautiful pictures and that is what really makes the story come alive.
4,Great Introduction to Celtic Music,"I concur with the other review that this is a wonderful album. If you are new to Celtic instrumental music, this disc would be a great introduction."
2,Impossible to get on and off!,"I had a VERY difficult time getting this slip on and off. The process left me bruised! I usually wear a size 2 or 4, and ordered a small, but this this is TINY and poorly designed. If you're going to purchase this item, I recommend going at least one size up, maybe two.Once on, the slip was comfortable enough and the underwire is a nice addition, almost sexy. Unfortunately, one large step cause the entire slip to roll up right over my hips, leaving me with a HUGE bulge under my dress and a very awkward unrolling and adjusting processes."
1,It's horrible,"This book absolutely disgusted me. It basically contains the romances of three women in the same family. In the first story a young girl marries a man who is not only much older than her, but was her guardian since she was twelve. Thisamn also hasa child with a slave and that son has his own offspring and leaves him at the old judge's house. Eventually the young girl, Vinnie, has a daughter who falls in love with the guy she grows up with--her own nephew. They have a kid born of adultry...It's just full of very unsettling situations."
4,short & sweet,"At about 60 pages with 200 words/page, this is more an essay than a book. At the beginning of the 20th century, SCIENCE had a distinguished status as the only producer of objective truths. This position was supported by various philosophies designed to distinguish scientific truth from other truths. This book describes the challenges to this status of science produced in the wake of Kuhn's work and responses to this challenge within the scientific and philosophical community. It is nice, brief and comprehensible introduction to the ""sociology of scientific knowledge"" requiring only a modicum of prior knowledge. My only complaint is that it is too sketchy at several points; I would have liked to see several of themes developed at greater length. This is the price of brevity."
4,Dulcimer Player,"Beautiful harmony. I would recommend this CD. I am rating it a 4 instead of a 5 because of some of the song choices. Wildflowers Don't Care Where They Grow is a great song written by Dolly. There are other great songs on this CD as well. If you like good, country, harmony you can't miss with this CD"
5,Heavenly Harmonies At Their Best,"This CD is just a great treat to listen to. Parton, Ronstadt and Harris were meant to sing together. Producer George Massenburg waved his magic wand in the studio and let these great vocalists produce superlative sounds. The harmonies are on par with anything the sisters of The Rankin Family sang. It helps that this trio had great material to work with. The opener ""The Pain Of Loving You"" (written by Parton and Porter Wagoner) sounds as fresh today as when it was first written in 1971 - the bluegrass feel to this one is just great. Parton's ""Wildflowers"" is wonderfully written, but could have been made a lot better by increasing the oomph of the percussion after the first verse and chorus. Ronstadt shows off her vocal chops to great effect on ""Telling Me Lies"" and ""Those Memories Of You"" perhaps showcases the trio's harmonies the best. This is a solid recording that has become and will stay timeless. First-rate."
4,Trio CD,I got the CD on time and in acceptable condition at a reasonable price. I am satisfied with the service.
4,Nostagic music,"The selection of songs, some many decades old,brought back memories of music of years ago - before rap, heavy metal and indecent lyrics that usually cannot be understood anyway."
5,The CD is GREAT,"I have already purchased this CD and it is great.I listened to your sample just to see how it works,new WebTV owner.Your sample all messed up.It skipped and missed. Just though I would let you know."
5,ARTIST OF THE CENTURY?,"If anyone ever needed a reason to recognise Dolly's talent, then they should just listen to 'WIDFLOWERS'. Can anyone else see the connect between Song number 6 and Elton John?"
3,good,"I really enjoy listening to all of the artists on the Cd. However, there were only about 2 songs that I liked."
5,I'm Biased,"So I grew up with this album, my mother playing it all the time. It is so moving that it cannot be described in words."
3,"""trio"" with Dolly Parton, et al","I bought this CD for the song ""Wildflowers"" which I love! However, the ""remastering"" of this older CD/song leaves much to be desired. But, that said, at least I can hear the song! The song I give 5 stars, the quality of the CD, barely 3 stars."
4,knitting and crochet dvd,"I like the dvd has new ideas on knitting and crochet, I love watching it again and again. Although I wish the presenters demonstrate the whole full patterns instead of a bit here and a bit there, and one dvd has only four epsiodes are not much."
3,Where are the Armitage Shanks references?,"Was this the CD that members of UK Punk legends Armitage Shanks helped out on? I know they did other stuff, but not sure if this is one of the CDs they did with Billy. Check out their CD 25 Golden Showers for listening pleasure."
2,"A Shell of What ""Secrets"" Use to Be","Over the years, I found the Windows ""Secrets"" to be the best book about Windows (3.1, 95 and 98). This book is by a different author, and it is a mere shell of the old series. Too short, too shallow, too bad. Just look at the begining, and view the description of the differences between Home and Professional editions of XP. The book told me no more than an advertisement would have."
3,Naruto Box Set 13,"The series isn't as good after season (box set)...10 i think, but still a great anime"
5,playing cards?,"I'm just wondering if this one comes with the next set of playing cards, because I don't want only part of the set. Can anyone tell me? Thanks in advance! :)"
3,easy to read but innocuous,"This book is at times entertaining, but when you're all done reading it, you'll forget about it in a matter of minutes. I'm not so keen about having everything explained in the last 10 pages with nothing much going on (not even a hint) in the first 100. But it's a good effort and, even if I'm not from that place, I can relate to the family ties. Overall, it's not too bad; it's not an Agatha Christie, though."
5,Great Book!,"This story is not the only thing that's great about the book! It was written just perfectly! No cuss words, wasn't TOO descriptive (I hate that in a book, it just takes me away from the story too much!), and it was funny and serious in just the right places! I don't like it when people write things like ""that old, delapidated red barn in the lush backyard, where the fluffy, white chickens sleep""; I like it just said and done with- ""the barn, in the yard, with the chickens""! That's it, that's all ya gotta say! If you get too descriptive, it takes you away from the story line, and you forget all about what the book's about! And, I love this book because it's not so descriptive, you could go to sleep for 10 minutes, wake up, and not know what in the world the book's about! Ugh, some people! Thankfully, though, she's not one of those people! LOL!Great book!!!"
3,"Great anime, but it installs a copy protection","I love hellsing and since ultimate is closer to the original manga, i had to buy the limited editions. The first 3 volumes never caused a problem, but with this volume i had troubles playing it in vlc media player. The sound and picture was choppy, which surprised me, since all other dvd's played fine. Soon i discovered that this disk installs a copy protection rootkit on your system, so that you can't copy files from the dvd. Seems like this caused the problem with playback. As if the copy protection rootkit isn't enough, i couldn't even watch the movie. I used Anydvd, which disabled the protection during playback and this worked fine. The movie is great, but for the rootkit, i would have given it 5 stars. Now i consider not buying dvd's from this company anymore, since i don't like software being installed without my knowledge which interferes with my system. Things like that should be banned"
5,Disappointed,"I really enjoyed watching the new Hellsing series. I was sad when they stopped making them. Much like the first animated series, the show ends without really having an ending."
4,Ultimate Helsing 4,It's a good movie although I never expected Rip Van Winkle to be a girl. Plenty of action a little slow in some parts but still a good movie.
2,Just lacking,"I am a big Hellsing fan, but this one was terrible. There was hardly any action due to the constant babbling from the characters, especially from the antagonist leader who gives a an unneeded five minute speech at the very end."
1,Don't waste your money,"Lots of long dialogue scenes and one stupid scene when one if the villain randomly sings for like 5 minutes are just a couple reasons why you should just rent/borrow this movie. I feel like the whole thing was dragged out, and I don't understand how you pull that off in such a short show.Anyway I was very dissapointed and I wish I had viewed this before I payed for it."
3,good for !st timers but a little out dated...,"This book is great for First-Time visit to Europe, but you have to get a more updated version.. It keep quoting figures of how much things cost and how much money you need to fly there. Today all those figures are outdated. The rate of exchange is non existent."
3,Good but Delicate,"The positives, easily attached and does and excellent job of shading the LCD on my SLR and the hoods are relatively inexpensive.The negative side, I have found the plastic hinge pins to be easily broken off when the hood is in the open position. The device would be rated with five stars if these pins were more substantial. I have gone through three hoods with broken hinge pins on my Nikons."
3,Quality not great,"These hampers/baskets are quite expensive for the quality. While pretty, they are quite fragile and not meant to carry heavy laundry loads, much less toys, which is what I actually ordered them for."
2,Fragile,"I found these at Target for $40 and you really get what you pay for. If one big hamper cost $50 and all 4 of these cost $40, something seems off and it was.They are very fragile and the rope that holds the tops on broke after a few times of opening it. I didn't even put any laundry in it yet before they broke. I would probably be able to fix it but why fix something that is brand new?Overall I'm going to try a higher quality one since these seem too fragile."
3,"not bad, but...","These look nice on the outside.However, the hamper lids have pieces of ""wood"" sticking out all over the inside of the lids. When you put clothes in, they catch and break off.They would be great if the lids were finished as nicely on the inside as they are on the outside."
4,Very good.,This is not light reading..It is a read that one has to take slow and think about. The information presented in the book is very thought stimulating. It is an excellent book and the author does a good job of simplifying a very complex subject.
2,The content is interesting yet somewhat disorganized.,"The book is interesting in that the author tries to relate human consciousness, quantum physics, and eastern mysticism to an undersdtanding of dreams. Some of his commnents are thought prevoking but the material needs to be more tightly organized. He keeps telling the reader ""I will explain this more fully in a later chapter..."". This made the 360 page read less enjoyable for me than it might have been had the material been presented in a less conversational format."
1,What a Nightmare!,"This was the most incoherent, rambling, pointless exposition which never achieves what it sets out to do. After reading this, I know I won't bother reading any other books by Mr. Wolf. Don't waste your money."
2,"If everything's a dream, then nothing's a dream.","10-Point Rating: (5.5)This book gets two stars for dealing with an extremely interesting topic and for making quite a few good points throughout, however the author just wants dreams to do too much. The fact that we can and do distinguish between waking (i.e. ordinary) consciousness and dream consciousness means that the two must be qualitatively different - and in fact they are. The discontinuity of dreams among other features distinguishes them as derivative conscious states, that is to say they are not primary - everyday waking consciousness is primary. We define dreams relative to waking states and not vice-versa for a variety of reasons, and Wallace does little to challenge these obvious differences. It's a bit like saying ""everything's alive"" or ""everything's conscious"" - statements like these tend to cheapen the meanings of these words, if everything is, then nothing is."
4,Post WW2 Berlin Crime Thriller - Very Good,"Kerr sets his book in the rubble and devastation of post-war Berlin and Vienna. Tough ex-cop Private Detective Bernie Gunther fends off a few dark secrets of his own as he tries to find the real killer in a crime that has framed an former colleague. The imagery is powerful and reminds me of the film `The Third Man' - corruption, crime, intrigue, politics and power touching everything as the four victorious powers battle with each other for control and influence. Meanwhile the Germans, innocent and guilty alike, battle for survival, eking out a living among the racketeers and spies. A very good read."
5,A Good Change...,"Ever run into one of those heroines you'd REALLY like to shake up cause they're too wimpy? If you read a lot of manga, chances are you have. Well, my friend, this heroine breaks the mold. Don't get me wrong, we have to have a moment or two (geez, we can't all be perfect) and yes, this girl does that whole schtick for about a page or two...But after that, she kicks butt! Literally! The art is great, the character's great, and here's a hint...she doesn't end up with who you think she does. Highly reccommended! Happy reading!"
1,Freezes,"I made the mistake of buying this software. Don't do it if you are running the latest Mac OS called Tiger. It will just freeze and not work at all. I have an emac which all other software works just fine, except for this one...Worst of the Worst"
3,What were they thinking?,"If you could look up the phrase ""hit and miss"" in the dictionary, you would find a illustrative reference to Chicago 18. This album contains some excellent original compositions by the band members. James Pankow's ""One More Day"" contains a catchy upbeat melody with some great backgound vocals that conjures up memories of his compositions of a decade earlier. Robert Lamm's ""Forever"" has a unique jazz rythym with a tremendous saxophone solo at the song's end. Unfortunately, songs like these are lost among the song contributions from outside the band. The lyrics from ""If She Would Have Been Faithfull"" are painfull:""its a paradox, full of contridictions, it defies a logical explanation."" Throw the thesaurus away."
1,Chicago's Worst..By far,"Just the atrocity of ruining 25 or 6 to 4, makes this stinker THE worst album by any famous U S band."
3,The Remake Makes The Album,"I hear that many classic Chicago fans were highly upset by the remake of ""25 or 6 to 4."" Why mess with a classic? Because times change. Because Terry Kath did die. Because other members of the band have come and gone leaving the brass/woodwind section and the drums the only original parts of the band. And they contribute mightily to the quality of the Remake.The Remake makes the album. I have recorded it alongside the original on my ""personal greatest hits"" CD. Yes, it's not classic 1969 Chicago, but it reflects some of the changes that have occurred not only in the group but in popular music over the time. It's a great air guitar number too. As a former high school trombonist who followed everything new Chicago did in the 70s, I was pleased with the remake of ""25 or 6 to 4."""
3,"Okay, but not like Chicago 19!!","Chicago 18 is okay, but there are only 2 really good songs on here, ""If She Would Have Been Faithful"" and ""Will You Still Love Me"". Buy Chiacgo 19 or 17 before this one."
1,Wow is this bad,"I mean come on now Peter Cetera left Chicago.... The curse was lifted. They find a songwriter to write some ballads for them, which made Peter Cetera, seem like a rocket scientist. Sad... Yet I never lose sleep over this.... hmmmm go figure"
3,The start of another dry spell for Chicago.,"I bought this album thinking it would be just as good as Chicago 16 or 17, but I was wrong. The sound on this album was so not them. When Peter Cetera left the band to pursue a solo career, it's almost like he took the magic with him. However there are some great songs on this album like ""Niagra Falls"", ""Will You Still Love Me?"", and ""Over and Over"". The remake of ""25 or 6 to 4"" should've been aborted. I never thought in a million years that a band could butcher one of their own songs (a classic at that), man was I wrong. This is why I gave this album 3 stars."
4,Chicago's debut minus Peter Cetera,"This album marks Chiacgo's 18th overall and their debut minus original member Peter Cetera. Possibly,this album,released in the fall of 1986,was in the works before Cetera exited. I think I heard him singing background vocals on this album's hit WILL YOU STILL LOVE ME?. By the time this album was finished,Cetera was enjoying success as a solo artist,having released SOLITUDE SOLITAIRE,his second solo album,the preceding summer. However,there is a new version of 25 OR 6 TO 4 on this album,which was written or co-written by Cetera and initially a hit for the band in 1970. I must admit,Cetera's successor has similar sounding vocals. Also,this album is the band's third on the Warner Bros. label. The former Columbia clients recorded CHICAGO 16 and CHICAGO 17 on WB between 1981 and '84(estimate)."
3,The now standard Chicago formulae,"This CD opens with the super Niagra falls. After this there is If she would have been faithful ( a great twist in the standard soppy ballad lyrics - ""If she would have been faithful, if she would have been true, then I would have been cheated, I would never know real love, I would have missed out on you"" )is just the standout on the CD. Others that make the grade are: Will you still love me, One more day and I believe. This is an ok CD that is not a vital addition to your Cd collection but does have a couple of highlights - Not too sure about the remake of 25 or 6 to 4."
3,See Poppi's review below. It says it all.,"I don't like ""Niagara Falls"" or ""Forever"". ""If She Would Have Been Faithful"" is good, as is everything else here. Very ""mid-80's"" production with synths and electric drums.Jason Scheff steps in here and does a fine job. He will forever be compared to PC by fans that just can't get over it. Which is a shame.""One More Day"" is the best track here."
4,the post Cetera album,"At first I didn't think this album would work because of the departue Peter Cetera, but after hearing Jason Scheff sing I thought Chicago 18 would be a smash hit. ""Will You Still Love Me?"", ""If She Would've Been Faithful"" and ""Forever"" are my favorite songs and I think that ""25 or 6 to 4 86"" was nicely done. Way to go Jason Scheff!"
2,What happened on this one?,"Other than 'Will you still love me' this album is chock full of mediocre songs...stick with 16,17,19 or Greatest hits 1982-1989"
5,BRILLIANTLY FUNNY AND WICKEDLY SOPHISTICATED,"When Alice Roosevelt Longworth said ""if you have nothing nice to say, come sit by me,"" she may have been anticipating the birth of Ruth Dudley Edwards. Ms. Edwards' cozy mysteries aren't particularly cozy but she is both brilliantly funny and wickedly sophisticated. An example: ""Amiss thought he had particularly enjoyed La Condition Marseillaise and the Socratic Vaginal Dialogues, a minute-by-minute account by five existentialists of how they gang-raped two nuns in a Marseilles brothel."" If you're an over-educated cynic looking for a zippy cocktail of verbal vitrol, this book is for you."
4,For a shy or depressed teen.,"When I was learning how to drive, I burst out crying when I was trying to stop on a hill at an intersection in a car with a standard transmission. My driving instructor asked me why I was crying. He said that I was living during the happiest time of my life. For some teens that is true. It certainly wasn't for me. If you are such a teen or know one, Debbie Thurman's journal would be a good exercise for a girl with self-esteem problems. Half of each page is devoted to her commentary of typical teenage girl problems. The other half is left blank so that the teen can write in it.I think that every youth group leader or pastor should have this journal available for girls that are in their group. Writing is a powerful tool for healing. Parents, too, should consider giving this to a daughter who is having a tough time during the teen years. I wish it had been available for my teenage daughters."
4,"Cute, but not the most comfortable","I love these shoes...they are cute and are made from great quality leather. The heel height is just right, but like most cute shoes, I got blisters the first time I wore them. I received loads of compliments, so for me the blisters were worth it! Be sure to buy some band-aids if you buy these shoes."
2,Buttons fell off first time we tried putting it on! Straight to the TRASH,"FLIMSY quality. I wish we got the pajamas version of this costume instead, we have pajama batman and they're awesome. we got this for the bigger cape....honestly, it was a total dissapointment."
4,Very impressed,"I stumbled onto this book in a little used book store in denver and am very impressed. The poem ""Poem"" is about as funny a poem I've ever read and the rest of this text is funny, thought-provoking and very well written. I do think he could be a little clearer in a couple of his poems verbage but overall I think this a a really good-almost great book of poetry. I've let several friends look at it, and they love it. It is well worth the bargain price... I write fiction, and I can tell the work that went into this text. Anyway, this is a find and a gem."
5,The Best Poetry I've Read in a Long Time,"This collection is by far the best poetry I've read in a long time. Aaron isn't one of those stiff academic ""poets"". I could relate to just about everything in this book and I laughed in a few places. This is modern poetry at its best. He doesn't overplay the ""southwest"" feel, either; just enough to give the work character."
5,Great for beginners,"I bought 7 books and gave away as presents, everyone loved them. Great for basic information and the pictures helped with identifing problems."
4,A book for someone who want to be an artist,"At first I only want to find some information for painting with watercolour. But when I read this book, it is very encouraging me. I have never study a watercolour with such depth as the book has directed me. It really helps me to appreciate great masters work. You will feel yourself able do the same as the book tell you. Also, it is simple and not too complicated to understand."
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought this book under the ""New"" listing and it was shipped to me as a used book. There is inked underlining throughout the text. This is not a new book that was sold to me."
3,This Author knows Volksies!,"I really enjoyed this book. The author obviously knows her way around Volkswagens. I'm so glad she made Daisy use the bible of Volkswagens - John Muir's ""Idiot's Guide"".This was a cute love story, and an awesome story about a gal and her Beetle, but how many 15-yr-olds enjoy this? My critical eye says this book is too romancy for boys, and too technical for a lot of girls (Not all, however. There are those of us females who are mechanically-minded). As a 20-something VW enthusiast, however, I thought the book was fabulous."
2,I'M a huge monopoly fan... but I don't like this game.,"I love the game monopoly but I DO NOT suggest this game! Im lucky I got the game as a present because I would really have been mad at the waste of money.First, you can't save the game! I usually end up turning my system off because I can't save and don't want to waste the battery power.Second, you can't really tell which spaces are yours on the board. If you want to know what spaces you own prepare to spend more time going through the game manager tool to see what you own and do not own.The music is ok but after hours of playing the game it REALLY gets annoying! It overall has poor viewing of the board and other things such as title cards etc.Even if you are a huge monoploy fan you shouldn't buy this game.I bought and suggest the game ""Monopoly Party"" that is available for Gamecube, X box, and playstation 2. It is a lot better."
2,new monopoly,This is a great game except for one thing and it is a big one.................. There is no save game This is crazy because this is a very long game to play a whole game at once............. way to go you stupid programer.
1,"A bigger problem than the ""no save"" option is...","... When an opponent goes bankrupt, they simply quit the game and don't pay any of their debt to the player that bankrupted them. You get a message that the player simply ""resigns"" from the game. When this happens all of their property reverts back to being available for sale, all of their cash disappears and the player who bankrupted them gets NOTHING! And, just to clarify, all of the CPU players resign from the game in this manner without paying any of their debt, not just the last one left in the game.This bug means that you can spend most of your money building hotels and knock out 2 of the 3 CPU players without getting a single dollar back, only to then lose to the last player due to a relatively small rent owed. Considering the whole point of Monopoly, this is an unforgivable bug that completely ruins the game."
3,Too confusing to finish one game,"I have tried for HOURS to completely finish 1 SINGLE GAME. I have tried to trade more than once, and NOTHING HAPPENS. After trying to trade, i get frusterated, and don't feel like playing anymore. If I didn't have to deal with that, this game would be easier."
2,Gameplay/Dice Rolling Is Too Slow,"I read all the reviews on Amazon and decided to get the game anyway because it was cheap. Overall, the slowness of the gameplay makes the game unplayable. Every time you roll the dice the screen animates to follow the dice rolling, moves back to your gamepiece, and then follows it as it moves to each spot (10-12 seconds). Playing the game in person or on other systems (Gameboy, PC), dice rolling takes around 5 seconds. That sounds pretty picky to break it down by the second but just imagine a normal game of Monopoly taking twice as long because of dice rolling. That's what you get with this game.If anyone disagrees, please post a review about how you enjoy watching dice roll and pieces moving for 45 minutes of a 90 minute game. (No, you cannot turn off the animation.)"
1,guy in mn,this is the worst version of monopoly since the commodore 64 versions. first off no save feature. i guess the guys who programmed this one never play monopoly in their life. second a few times i would be playing this and the game suddenly locks up!!!!!!! so here i have a lot of properties and ready to making some bucks and suddenly on my turn i land on GO and then the game freezes!!! hasn't anyone else had this happen?. well any ways there are a lot better versions out there. even the old gameboy version is much better. take my advice don't buy this one. wait for a new version for the gameboy advance.
5,Woohoo!,Fun times! Great Monopoly game for on the go. Fun graphics and game play. Perfect for on the go play if you only own an GBA.
3,previous Gameboy version is better,"Plays is too slow by added graphics. The original gameboy Monopoly is better, the gameboy color version is the exact clone of original just color added in and it's the best version of Monopoly you'll find anywhere."
2,MONOPLY FOR THE BORED,"This game offers few of the basic fun things about playing monoply.Although there is a ""CUSTOM GAME"", you cannot alter the time limit.There is a ""TIME LIMIT GAME"" but you change the time from 1-24 hours but nothing else.However, this game is fine for those places such as the doctor's office.And there is another weird thing about this game. No winner is declared.It simply says ""GAME OVER"""
5,a good monopoly game,I like this monopoly game because you can take it with you.It's like plying a real monopoly game.
2,Bah...,"The only good thing about this is the cover, seriously...it has lights on it and the drawing is pretty cool. Its not a book, theres blank pages inside. Was expecting something else ..."
3,It's a journal...a blank journal.,"I hope you are reading this before you buy it and not, like me, reading the reviews after the fact. I thought this was going to be more of Tim Burton's works. It is not. It is a journal with Tim Burton artwork on the outside and some repeatable artwork on the pages of the blank journal. This is a journal for someone else to write their tragic thoughts. The description could be rewritten to make it clearer. Still, it's sort of neat albeit it slightly cheesy with the light up cover."
5,Superb,"Easily the most effective, strongest and best value for money Cough Lozenge on the market in the USA today. Buy it and see!"
4,Really works wonderfully,"A cough drop that really clears your throat,calms a cough and soothes a sore throat.Not just a candy drop but a cough drop."
4,Looks great but...,Out of the box it had some problems with the accuracy of the alarm setting (going off to early). Over time that either went away or I adjusted to it.
5,Conversations in Clave,A very good DVD for drummers interested in latin styles. A very well done step by step instruction and easy to understand.
5,Well documented,"This is a well written and documented book that over turns the lie, perpetuated by the right, that the media is 'liberal.'"
1,Uh-Okay... The title tells you something...,"Serious left-wing denial of media's liberal leanings. Herman is the mouthpiece of Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), a liberal media watchdog that critiques rare incidents of anti-liberalism in media. If you're left of Bill Clinton and Mikhail Gorbachev this book may interest you."

4,Breyer Halter,I got this halter from A Bit More Tack. It is just like a real one. It is a nice halter but the price is not so nice. If younger kids get a hold of it it will probley break. It does not fit that well on the Black Stallion though. I do not reccamend this toy from kids under 3 or 4 because it is small and they could probley swallow it and choke. Overall it is a nice halter.
4,Good,"unlike the nylon on,this halter is durable,the only problem with these products is the lead always breaks."
2,A One-Hit Wonder,"Listening to the samples makes me laugh as I recall my disappointment when I bought this album in the 1980's based on the wonderful rendition of ""Lean on Me."" While that particular song is still excellent in my opinion, the rest of the album remains sheer misery."
3,Club Music.,Lots of unremarkable Club music on the album with one very notable exception - Lean on Me. The album is worth buying just for this rendition.
4,An R & B classic,"This album is a must have for any die hard, true R & B fan. From the likeable dance licks to the smooth and drum moving ballads which keep your feet racing. A true collector's piece with every song a hit."
5,White Girls Really Do Have Soul,"Newcomer Christina Fasano puts so much passion & soul in her latest album, ""Spiritually Wet,"" that it should end once-and-for all the debate that white girls AREN'T funky and DON'T have soul. Well, they haven't heard Ms. Fasano. Her singing is so blistering in parts, she's also convinced me that white boys really CAN dance, too. She's that good. My favorite cuts though, are the ones where I feel she's not trying so hard to prove how bitchin' she is: The SLOW cuts. Christina, you are already bitchin' and mighty fine. Anyone as beautiful and gifted as you are doesn't need to have a whole horn section and half of the drummers of New York City behind you, babe. Just take that dynamite voice and don't forget it's already a miracle just in itself. And you know what, listeners, she does, too, but you almost have to wait for the very last cut, the most vulnerable, most moving, most achingly beautiful, and least funky song on this great album. What A Talent!"
5,Christina Rocks!,"Christina Fasano is the original Funky White Girl! She sent Shock Value Music Webzine her CD last month. ""Spirtually Wet"" spotlights Christina's soulful voice that cuts through the mainstream with a message that goes right through your soul! That's why she is going to be our next ""Artist of the Month!"" -C.J. Cauley, Shock Value Music Webzine"
2,Cute idea but....,"This story revolves around a girl, her mom and grandmother. The dilemma involves what the girl is going to buy for her birthday. It had the potential to be a nice story but never really took off. There are some unfortunate elements like references to bathroom functions and superstitious wishes. The art work leaves a bit to be desired as well. All in all, there's not much inspiring about this one."
3,Goldfish Girl,"I bought this at Petsmart. Its perfect for my 19 inch tall 125 gallon aquarium with goldfish (they grow big so its hard to find tank toys big enough for them to swim through that don't cost an arm and a leg). However when taking it into the house my husband lightly hit the side of the trunk with one of the legs and it snapped off. Its a bit of a drive to Petsmart for us, so since it still would stand with the leg missing, we put it in the tank anyways. The fish LOVE it. We will be getting another one for the other side of the tank. But we may bring bubble wrap to get it home in one piece. LOL."
1,Ask question,"Can seller tell me if this software could be download to Dopod cell phone (Model : CHT9000)?If so, I will consider to buy it . Pls reply me soon. Tks!"
1,Don't buy. No longer supported by TomTom!,"I've been using this software for a number of years and love it.Via the PC ""TomTom Home"" program, TomTom will offer you an updated map to buy. Beware, this dates from 2007. There are no newer maps available, nor will there be as TomTom have ceased all support for this version.There is no new version that will run on my HP IPAQ so I have to buy a new SatNav or put up with old maps.Thank you TomTom!"
1,Unsorported. No map updates.,"While it is very cool having my palm centro act as a GPS map aid using a keychain bluetooth GPS receiver, I have to give this product the lowest rating for one major reason: tom tom doesn't provide map updates. Even if they did, updates for four regions would end up costing 150% more than the this software which includes dozens of maps."
1,Don't waste your money,"The price of this book is a joke. You can get more and better letters and instruction for FREE just by going to Bencivenga Bullets or Clayton Makepeace on the web, or saving your junk mail. I'm a direct response writer and have made $100k+ a year freelancing for over a decade, and I think it's morally reprehensible to try and get this much money from beginning writers. Author doesn't seem to have even one original idea -- the book's name isn't even original -- Abbie Hoffman famously wrote ""Steal this Book"" more than 30 years ago. Kilstein isn't interested in helping beginning writers, just in stealing from those trying to learn how to make it in the biz. SHAME ON HARLAN KILSTEIN!!!!!"
4,Always a good travel guide brand,"It was Lonely Planet Vietnam that got me hooked on their series, and after traveling throughout Southeast Asia, I maintain Lonely Planet are the best travel advisor books, with the Rough Guide series a close second. I like that I can find what I need as a backpacker, but know where, when and on what to splurge. This particular one is not quite as strong as their Vietnam one, but I think will improve in the next version."
2,Not a good Lonely Planet,"I love Lonely Planet, and have traveled to dozens of countries following their advice. This guidebook, however, was pretty worthless (at least for peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, where we were). The food recommendations were very hit-or-miss (so after a while we ditched their advice and followed wikitravel/tripadvisor (luckily we had internet everywhere we were)), and the maps were AWFUL. Kuala Lumpur's was completely unusable. For planning, the book was OK--descriptions of sites were good, but not so much for logistics, which may reflect Malaysia's rapidly improving infrastructure more than the book itself. We were a bit frustrated by finding accommodation in Malaysia-- almost all of the LP reviews are somewhat tepid, and considering how inexpensive accommodation is in MY, we would have liked some more rave-worthy guesthouses. Not sure if that reflects on the book or the country, though. Still, until LP updates this book, I'd go with a different guidebook."
5,"Malaysia, Singapore & Brunei","This book is great. It has accurate information and makes trip planning a breeze. I have traveled all over Asia, and I use lonely planet books to plan all my trips."
1,Not yet received in mail.,Unfortunately the postal service in China is sporadic and somewhat unreliable. I am still hoping that the book I ordered in early October will arrive soon. The reason I purchased the book is to plan a December holiday in Singapore and Malaysia.
5,Romancing the Sax,"Abbott has put together a combination of songs and music accompaniment that is sax at its best. This stunning array of music celebrates the unassuming human heart and spirit. I have gifted this to several of my friends of all ages who consider it unequaled in excellence. It is an exquisite romantic album which luminates the need to fill an evening with entertaining friends for other than the joy of watching sunsets, consuming fine wine and culinary delights. It is a sinfully beautiful album."
2,As empty as a baitless lobster trap.,"Nothing happening on a very small island. Even the lobsters don't seem to cooperate with this author. If the author were not a woman doing a traditional man's job the manuscript for this book would never have made it onto the mail boat. And to frequently say that something ""sucks"" harldly shows powers of explication for this Colby College graduate."
5,Lobster Chronicles,"The Lobster Chronicles is a true story of the author's experiences as a lobster fisherwoman from a 40 year old's perspective. The author grew up on a small rustic island off the coast of Maine and returned home recently to become a lobster fisherwomen after pursuing other career options on the mainland. Originally, I heard the author speak on ""Book Notes"" on CNN and was captivated by her unusual career as a woman. Because the author reads her own story, she easily draws you into her unique experiences and family history."
5,great insight into the life of a lobster fisherman,I really enjoyed the sense of place and people and can't wait to read the rest of Linda Greenlaw's books. The author takes you into the daily life on the island and shows us the beauty and banality that coexist in her life.
4,Entertaining Look @ NE sea community culture.,"If you are looking for an entertaining, easy read and enjoy reading about the ocean and/or the sociocultural aspect of nautical life, written by someone with a good nack for writing then this is your book. I read it and have loaned it out 2 or 3 times, and haven't heard any complaints....which these days is saying alot, considering some of the stuff that gets published out there, and slapped with a $25 price tag only to end up on a clearance rack for good reason."
3,The Lobster Chronicles,"This book chronicles the life of Linda Greenlaw, the author, during a lobster fishing season. Living on a small island off the coast of Maine, the author allows us into her downeast life. We learn some great information on the lobster fishing industry, as well as the lifestyles of the residents of Isle Au Haut.Some funny anecdotes and a glimpse into life off the coast of Maine make up this short, quick read, book. Being a resident of Maine, myself, I always like to read authors from here. I have yet to be disappointed."
2,Not what it should have been,"I was prepared to like this one. I did not read Greenlaw's previous work, but the idea of presenting life on a Maine island, delving into the trials and simple joys of this life, really appealed to me. I wish that was what Greenlaw had done here. Instead I found a series of dull complaints about inept handymen, the lackluster love life of the author, and character sketches that are so lacking in detail that I can't understand why they were included. Chapter after chapter of complaining about the poor season, her father, her poverty, become so tedious that you hope she gets a few lobsters just so she'll stop whining. Even the sections that were more enjoyable, when she's writing about the nuts and bolts of lobster fishing, are written in a style that just lies on the page. There was a great idea here, somewhere, buried under the bad prose."
3,NOT UP TO SNUFF,THIS BOOK WAS OKAY BU NOT AS GOOD AS HER FIRST BOOK I CONTINUED TO READ THIS BOOK HOPING IT WOULD GO ON MORE ABOUT FISHING FOR LOBSTER
5,Very fun!,I laughed alot! Anyone who has ever lived in a small town will relate to this book. If not you will wish you lived in a small town just for the comedy of it! Linda is a good writer. If you have red any of her other books you already know this! I highly recommend this book!
3,Amusing but Shallow,"I've read Linda's other book and found much of it riveting. But this volume just leaves the reader flat. The day in the life style certainly works for this type of book but the quirky personalities and amusing events needed far more development. If the reader is to truly care about what happens to whom on this little island, we need to know more about why we should care about them. Also, the best part of the book started to be about the relationship between father and daughter, but that never really seemed to develop. Maybe in her next volume. Stay tuned."
2,Barely a book,"I don't get it. There is no story, just a meandering. While I was hoping to be drawn in to a vivid life of ocean hardship and island comforts, it is just kind of drab.The pages are easy to turn, and she writes nicely. I realized half way through the book that it was going nowhere. I finished it anyway, hoping for some insight or revelation. There was none, except of course for the map that appears at the end, too lately revealed for it to serve it's function."
2,Lobster Chonicles,"I've now read all three of Linda's books, and now I have nothing else to look forward to in life. :(Jennie Logsdon Martinwww.ifish.net"
3,Not as interesting as I'd hoped,"Greenlaw's latest narrative sounded like an interesting read: doesn't the rustic tale of lobster fishing seem appealing in comparison with our ordinary, suburban lives?Not really, I guess. Linda should have waited another year or two so that we could get more than a picturesque snapshot of Maine. Giving the author more time to ""round out"" some of the personal stories could have gone a long ways toward engaging the reader. The Lobster Chronicles offers a pleasant glimpse into small-island life but didn't really live up to its full story-telling potential."
1,Does not live up to the reviews,"Don't waste your money on this book. After reading the reviews, I was expecting a short story that was both entertaining and written with style. I found neither to be true. The prose is not written in a flowing, easy to read way, and the story line has nothing to say. The characters lacked character and could have been developed better. The story is shallow and the outcome predictable."
2,save your money,"i'm a HARD core andretti and newman fan.what a letdown this tape was.the first feature's so bad i think it gave me cancer.the second half is slightly better, though."
4,Nice documentary,"This is a documentary which follows both Mario Andretti and Paul Newman through several races in 1983, showing victories, defeats and crashes, some of them spectacular. Though there is no real structure, it's nice to watch. I found it too short : both men deserved (separately) a much longer documentary. However I think it is a must for every Paul Newman fan."
4,dressed to chill,Dressed to chill is a most pleasant and relaxing disc. Marion Meadows being an accomplished and easy going musician.I exspect to be playing this disc many times in the future. Thismusic is best discribed as Chill lounge maybe even late night jazz.
4,Consistant as always.,"Once again the gifted marion is on top form as always. Although not as strong as previous outing ""in deep"", a similar musical journey, the highlights being ""dance with my daughter"" and the wonderful ""1000 dreams"".As always Marion's art of soprano playing is head and shoulders above any current and forseeable smooth jazz sax players."
4,Just CHILL,"This is a great cd to enjoy on the way home from work, or as the title says, ""Dressed to Chill."" Anyone who buys this CD will not be disappointed."
3,Just OK,"Great price but I don't think the rubber in this dogbone will last.... Next time, I'll be buying a GENUINE TOYOTA PART instead!"
4,Far too under-rated...,"I have no idea why this album gets dismissed as ""rubbish"" by many Talking Heads fans and David Byrne himself. It's not that bad. You've got the hits ""Love For Sale"" and ""Wild Wild Life"" which are good songs but there is so much better to be found on here. ""Papa Legba"" has some neat percussion. ""People Like Us"" is a good song but it's even better in the movie 'True Stories' (which i recommened you check out) where John Goodman sings it! ""Dream Operator"" has to be one of the most beautiful songs the Talking Heads have ever written and it's probably my favorite on the album. The only song I never really cared for is ""Hey Now"". One last thing I have to say is when a band like Radiohead names themselves after one of the songs off this album, it can't be all that bad."
4,To add to the confusion,"Actually there were THREE albums that came out.-The Talking Heads album, True Stories-Sounds from True Stories, with music from Carl Finch and others.and finally, the really obscure album-The actual music from True Stories including Pops Staples singing Papa Legba.I'd love to get ahold of this if anyone knows how and where."
3,Heinously Underrated,"I'm not going to give this album five stars or say that it's the best album ever, because it's clearly not. I will say, however, that this album is consistently underrated by music critics. I have a lot of fun with this album every time I listen to it. It's just not as inventive and artistic as other Talking Heads albums are. I can't exactly explain this feeling but I have it. One more time: I enjoy this record and I'm not afraid to say it."
5,My favourite Talking Heads album,"David Byrne's songwriting talent certainly comes out strongly here - each song has good lyrics, with most tracks being on the lighter side of life. ""Wild Wild Life"" was a monumental hit, as was ""Love For Sale"" - unfortunately no other song made the radio playlists in this part of the world. This did mean however that I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the rest of album. Each track comes out strongly, and although the sounds range from hard rock to soft pop, the theme flows rather well from start to finish. This is a definite buy for any pop or rock lover.If you are new to Talking Heads, then expect quality 80's pop and rock with an American flavour. This album is an excellent place to start; otherwise check out ""Stop Making Sense"" which is great, or the witty and humorous ""Naked""."
3,Talking Heads at their best,This is not the Soundtrack. This is Talking Heads performing songs that were in the movie. I want Papa Legba by Pops Staples.
4,A knew David Byrne was a wierdo....,"Saying this CD and little creatures were their worst albums? You got to be kidding, this one is 4 1/2 stars and little creatures 4 1/2. This was the CD that got me into Talking Heads after I picked up Speaking In Tongues. So if your a fan of TH, get this one first, little creatures, then SIT. The only way to get 5 stars is picking up Sand in the Vasoline."
3,ACTUALLY 2 1/2!,"I have to agree with Byrne. This and Little Creatures are the worst albums they released. If I had never heard any TH albums, I would think they are alright. But, TH are one of my favorite bands, and this album is not one of the reasons why. Anyone getting into them should initially purchase Popular Favorites. The best songs from their later albums are on there anyway. As far as individual albums go, the three Eno produced albums really are the best; and Stop Making Sense is a good live show to have."
1,NOT the original recording,"Buyer beware. I love the original album and give it a solid 5 Stars, but this recording is NOT it. Amazon should let potential buyers know these things. I have been very happy with my purchases in the past, but I am not happy about this one. If I could get a refund, which seems unlikely, I would delete this from my music library. Or I might just delete it anyway."
3,Good...,"It's highly impropable, but good. I don't think they write correctly that the plague ""sweeps the country"". It just breaks out in small pandemics. And the cause is rather unlikely. But, like I said, it's a good book. It's not one that one would read a half dozen times, though."
3,it was okay to read,"I had it figured out by page 70, although I was surprised by one minor (very minor) plot twist at the very end. The book was written some time ago so it's a bit dated, but it was interesting enough to keep me reading."
4,Pretty good book!,"I may have enjoyed this book more than i usually would, because when i found this at a thrift store i had no idea there was such a genre as ""medical thriller"". I was excitied to read this book for the simple reason that i have never read any type of book quite like it.Basically, it is a generic thriller with medical details and a plot concerning an ebola ""outbreak"". The story is, quite simply, ""average woman saves the country"". Now there was an instance or two where something happened that was a little far fetched, but i don't mind too much, being that this IS fiction. There was also one loose end that wasn't wrapped up. These two reasons are why i rated four stars instead of five.All in all, i enjoyed my first Robin Cook book, and i do own and plan to read two more of his books that i found at different thrift stores(those are ""Fatal Cure"" and ""Crisis"").To sum up my opinion of this book: it a pretty enjoyable thriller and page-turner. I am happy i took the time to read it."
4,A great read,This is another one of Robin Cook's great thrillers. This was the first book I read by him (like so many others) and found I could not put it down. Things just kept on moving and kept getting deeper and deeper into the heart of the issue. If you don't read any of his other books at least make time to read this one.
2,A disappointment,"I have just finished reading the book and didn't think it was all that great. If you want a good ""killer virus"" thriller, try The Andromeda Strain by Michael Crichton. What really annoyed me about this book was the ending. Oh, of course, Marissa just FALLs for what was supposed to be the evil boss. It's as if she totally forgets about Tad who has gone through all sorts of trouble for her.All in all, it's not the worst book I've read by far. It provides an interesting concept - intentional epedemics. But, however, the poor writing and horrible ending force me to give it 2 stars."
3,At least the medical details seemed to be consistent...,"The book itself was a pretty standard thriller - and predictable.I guess people who enjoy this genre usually like reading it for the ""process of discovery"" rather than for an unexpected ending.But the ""process"" wasn't that satisfying. Even though the Medical details were consistent and thorogh, the plot wasn't. I ekpt losing track of which city Marissa was in and why she was there (and later - what happened in it) because the changes (and number) of cities just happenedso fast... Also, quite a lot of loose story threads were left - suchaswhat happens to Tad, or how the 'mass infection' in Pheonixoccured, since the cafeteria theory was explainedto beavery weak one..."
3,decent thriller,"(Biological thriller) Ebola outbreaks start happening all over the USA, and Marisa Blumenthal of the CDC tries to get to the bottom of it, to her peril! This was very gripping, but the very smart protagonist missed a very obvious point over and over again, which was frustrating. And the last paragraph was really cheesy. But it was a pretty good ride.Potentially offensive material: some strong language, violence"
1,Awful,"If this were Robin Cook's first novel, it never would have been published. It is a dreadful piece of garbage. After reading it, I vowed never to read another Robin Cook novel. And, also, the plot is outdated. This casts the greedy doctors against the wonderful HMO's. Events of since shown that HMO's are a million times greedier than the greediest doctor. Robin Cook even recognized this, and cast the HMO's as the bad guys in a subsequent book."
1,Stinkie-Poo,"OUTBREAK is a badly written, badly plotted novel. After I read the book, I looked at the cover and first pages to see what the review excerpts said. All of them said, ""Robin Cook is a suspense master."" None of the quotes referred to OUTBREAK itself, I think because the publisher couldn't find any good reviews about the book. And I was appalled at how Cook didn't think the reader could figure out who the bad guy is. It is so transparent, as to be laughable! And last but not least, the book is horribly dated, in that doctors are the bad guys and HMO's are the good guys in it. As everyone knows now, HMO's are revealing themselves as more heartless than the mafia. Robin Cook has tried to rectify what he did in OUTBREAK by writing books since that show HMO's for the truly evil organizations they usually turn out to be. And I bought this book at a Robin Cook book signing, and had him sign it personally, so I was predisposed to like this book. But I sure didn't."
1,a disapointing book,I chose to read this book because I like suspense novels about deadly viruses and diseases. I thought this book lacked a lot. It had some bright spots but they did not last long. I figured out how the book was going to end after about the first 100 pages. I thought the plot was ridiculous and the pacing horrible. I will not recommend this book to anyone.
2,A Terror to Read,Trite and artificial like love situation. I couldn't continue dragging myself through this terror.
2,Audio delay,"It's a good movie and story of revenge. My only issue is the audio is out of sync with the video and the video skips when the audio is still going. I don't know what source they used to make the DVD-R but, they need to do some serious quality control. Bottom line, it's still watchable and you are getting what you pay for."
5,soulfully sensual and ear pleasing,"wow...this is a talented man, i am so happy that someone recomended this album to me. lymie's voice is so beautiful and rich. the music is fantastic. there are some oldies and some new songs. only conversation has to be my favorite however. i put it on repeat. i suggest if you enjoy reggae...buy this album. if you enjoy r&b....buy this album.....if you enjoy music buy this album.peace"
3,About: Heroines of the Soviet Union 1941-45 (Elite),"I did enjoy reading 'Heroines of the Soviet Union' and found it both very interesting and informative. The one thing that detracted from the overall good quality of the book was the poor quality of many of the photos in it. That is however excusable to a point, considering the low quality of most pictures taken by the Soviets during WWII. Maybe a research through German archives could have yielded better pictures, especially of those brave but unfortunate Soviet women and girls executed by the Germans. Still, I found the book a worthy buy."
1,Product came beat up.,This product had taken forever to get to me not only that it was beat up and scuffed the packaging was ripped up. The side of the book is now shredded and ruined. Not happy at all.
5,NYAHBINGHI ELDER CHANTS (BLESSINGS FROM THE ITES),"THIS MUSIC IS STICTLY NYAHBINGHI, THE VERY CORE ROOTS OF REGGAE MUSIC. IT'S THE FORBIDDEN MUSIC OF AFRICAN CULTURE WHICH THE SLAVE MASTERS TRIED TO BEAT OUT OF THEM, BUT WHICH THEY FAILED. FROM THE ISLAND OF JAMAICA, A SLAVE PLANTATION IN THE CARRIBEAN, BUT AS THE ELDERS IN THIS ALBUM SAY ""IT IS WHERE THEY CARRIED US BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" THIS IS NYAHBINGHI OF THE 1,2 ORDER. HEARTBEAT RHYTHEM. THIS FIRST RECORD RELEASED BY COUNT OSSIE IS ESSENTIAL TO ANY COLLECTION OF TRUE ROOTS REGGAE. THIS SET THE FOUNDATION OF THE LATER REGGAE ROOTS OF THE EARLY 70'S IN REGGAES ""GOLDEN ERA"". THIS IS THE MUSIC FROM ANCIENT TIMES. WORD, SOUND, AND POWER! FULL OF WISDOM, AND SPIRITUAL UPLIFTMENT. THERE ARE NO WEAKNESS, OR SLACKNESS ON ANY TRACK. LET BOTH CD'S JUST RIDE, AND REACH THE INNER HEIGHTS! A GIFT, A TREASURE, AND A BLESSING THIS ALBUM IS..."
2,"Didn't help, didn't make it worse","My son suffers from quite severe eczema. He is 6 years old. I tried this when he was about 3 yrs old and again at 5 years old. His itching was not relieved, the redness and bumps didn't go away. I tried it the second time out of shear desperation and the great reviews. We've had the greatest success with 2 baths a day and cetaphil lotion (the thick one in the tub not pump bottle) while his skin is still damp.Good luck to all you parents that are spending many sleepless nights trying to prevent your child from digging their skin off. You're not alone."
3,Misrepresented,"""Don't order this if you expect to get cream made by Dell Pharmaceuticals in the old Green/Red box as pictured. I wanted the old formula but it is misrepresented on Amazon in the picture and description. What I received was the NEW (UN-improved) formula (in a white tube with a baby picture) by Insight Pharmadeuticals..that I had already bought at Walgreens. It's just not the same formula as the old."""
3,I was expecting the new formulation of gentle naturals,Gentle naturals had release a new formulation based on there site. So I was expecting they will send me the new formulation but they didnt. They sent me the old formulation which had parabens in it. There stocks are not up to date.
2,Too detailed,"This is an okay book as a reference to look up specialty tests. Can't be used as a primary musculoskeletal exam book. There are too many details, not enough high yield info."
4,Good price good laptop,"Nice budget laptop, similar problem with processor speed mentioned in other review, runs 800 mgz full capacity of AMD Semperon 2600 should be around 1800 mgz. I called Averatec, and basicaly got no answer . Also don't like LED's under left typing hand. I gave it 4 stars becasue of these 2 problems. I have read that Semperons use "" 800mhz hypertransport"" architecure?? what ever that is, and that power increases as needed. If that is the case I wish Averatec would get up to speed on their product and maybe provide a bios upgrade?"
4,Great Bargain,"I've had this laptop for about a week now, and i am very happy with it. I was looking for a budget priced computer for word processing and web surfing. I have been more than satisfied with both.I have some visual problems, so I needed a large screen. the 15"" here is generous, with enough brightness even for my poor peepers. The keys are also larger than most laptops I've seen. The white on grey is high contrast, and easy to see.No, it's not lightening fast, but anyone who wants to play high end games and the like aren't looking at budget laptops anyway. As it is, I can play SimCity 4 and Warcraft III with no problem.There are only two drawbacks. one, i have upgraded to 512mb. This was only $100. Second, It's stingy on the software. I would like to have seen some bells and whistles included. But for the price, I cannot complain.I recommend this to those who want a glorified typewriter, or a student on a budget who would still like to watch DVDs or burn CDs."
4,"So far, so good....","If you're looking for a decent laptop but don't want to spend a lot of money, this is a good choice. I'm usually one to go for the popular name brands first, but decided to take a chance. With the included [...], this laptop is a bargain. Aside from some relatively minor issues (screen isn't as clear as it could be; keypad a little on the noisy side and could be arranged better), I can't find (yet) anything to complain about. However, be warned: if you're looking for a laptop with a huge amount of memory, a top-notch graphics card and an enormous hard drive, this is not the model for you. But if your needs are modest, this is a good buy!"
1,"Arrived open box,, had atapi error, MS works not installed",Arrived open box. The factory seal had been opened. This did not happen from bad glue. Pause on boot-up because of error message for non-existant slave drive. F2 resume took me to the bios set-up. MS Works was not installed. I do not know whether to exchange or just get refund. I would appreciate input from users.Only rely before February 5. saildale@hotmail.com
2,clarks shoes,"these shoes weren't very comfortable, and didn't live up to my expectations of Clark's shoes."
3,why i shouldn't buy golf ball retrievers,It looks like a great gadget to find a few balls. The first time I used it I fished out 25 balls (2 pro v's ). I also stepped into the mud and just about lost my shoe and could not finish the round. 2 pro v's $1 Round of golf priceless .
5,Ortho Pruning Great Information,"I bought this book for myself and my neighbor say it and loved it so much I purchased one for him, also. If you know nothing about pruning this book will get you started."
5,Comprehensive introduction,"I don't know if this book is for those who are experienced gardeners, but it was a great comprehensive introduction for this novice."
1,Very Disappointed in this book,"I was surprised to see everyone liked this book. I purchased this book and it was terrible so I went to my local library and rented several books on pruning. One of the books, ""Pruning Made Easy"" by Lewis Hills is far superior to all the others for a basic pruning book. The Ortho book talked about a subject or would mention a term that they already expected you to know. The book by Hill is basic but indepth."
1,Disappointing!,"I am an Alley Cats fan. Having seen them in concert and enjoying their other CD's I was very dissapointed in this effort. Not everyone can do Christmas, and sadly this appears to be the case here. Make another choice if your looking for a cappella Christmas music."
3,Bad Quality of Push Buttons,I have just received this phone today and looks very good but biggest problem is Dial Pad on Codeless - It's made out of rubber and you have to press very hard to dial numbers
5,Louder Than Hell,"This album is an absolute comedic masterpiece. Sam was one of the most incredible comics ever to hit the stage, and this is him at his best. The album was released shortly after his appearance on Rodney Dangerfield's HBO special, which brought him instant fame, and much of the material from that appearance is on this album. All you need to know is that you will laugh as hard as you ever have when you listen to Louder Than Hell."
4,Judge others by this classic,"Truly one of the greatest comedy albums EVER. Recorded at Sam's peak, Louder Than Hell was "" a bull in the china shop"" of recorded comedy, tackling topics such as AIDS, divorce, terrorism and charity. Never politically correct and never dull.The only disappointments with this recording is, it's too short, and not available on CD (c'mon Warner Bros.!)"
4,Wow..what memories!,"This was one of the very first science fiction books I read. I was so into this book that I would read it after bedtime using a flashlite under the covers. Young boy, alien, friendship and the mysterious unknown giant planet Saturn made for great adventure. I was with them.. I felt as if I was a part of the group.. This should have been made a paperback. Now you can't buy a copy that is affordable. All these years and I would still love to read Star Ship on Saddle Mountain again."
5,starship on saddle mountain,"I have been an avid reader all of my life yet this children's book is my all time favorite. I have searched for it for many years to read again after reading it in grade school in the 50's. It did not disappoint me when I found it available on kindle. I actually typed my own self-edited version on Word and printed out a copy for myself to avoid paying a big price for the book. It has a deeper subtle meaning for an adult. About searching for a home, self-reliance, peace and community cooperation. It is still a mysterious and intriquing book. I think it would make for a great movie also. I should suggest this to a producer if I knew one!"
3,A Little disappointed,To the point......The meter is ok I guess. It's tough getting it in the case along with the leads it comes with. The quality remains to be seen. The big disappointment is that every tester I have had over my 27 yr career has had a continuity tester.....this one has one too. But....every other one that I had has a ringer...or tone that rings when test something for continuity. Touch the leads together and you get a tone ....this one does not and I don't like it
1,Broken,This product worked as described for 6 months. Failed when I needed it most *ZAPP* ouch.. I should have listened to my electrician and bought a separate multimeter and non-contact detector.
4,Works Well,"It is a handy tool for general use. Like others have said, you can't adjust the sensitivity low enough to trace individual wires in a panel. I didn't really think about I started using it, but yo can only connect leads to the negative. The positive probe is the built in probe only."
2,Tame,"I was expecting more sex/nudity in this flick since it was R-rated. I've seen more in a PG movie. Lilith was pretty hot, but the other girls were nothing special. Beware, Gary Busey has a bit part in it and it is a very hokey part. Lorenzo Lamas also had a small role in it but he must be desperate for work."
3,hell bent,"this movie was'nt to bad , the girls are hot in this movie .plot is good acting is good . doesnt have a low budget look to it . i reccomend it."
1,This movie is horrible,"The Succubus is disgusting.. needs to get her teeth cleaned .Lorenzo Lamas must be desperate for work, has a very small role with bad acting as usual.]Busey has a small role and looks and sounds like he is on something.If you want a laugh at bad acting and dialog. this is your movie."
3,Lilith she really needs a attitude adjustment,"Ive never seen this movie, however I know about the original myth.its a story about the first wife of Adam, a woman who embraced evil and darkness as a solution for revenge against Adam and his decendents.All because adam didnt want her to be on top. lolIve seen and heard about alot of bad ideas, in my time but what she did takes the cake.SteveWest VirginiaP.s OF COURSE im glad there is finally a movie out about her."
4,Suspenseful and well written,"I liked this book a lot. It was one of those books I just couldn't put down for long, although I liked his previous 2 novels more, especially ""A Density of Souls"".I thought the book was well thought out and written and very suspenseful. I liked the plot twists and the counterplay of ideas between Jimmy and Adam. The gay sex wasn't too explicit for me, although I'm straight, so this book should appeal to readers of any sexual orientation. My only problem with it was that so much of the first half centered on Adam and what he was doing in LA and so little was written about what Caroline was doing in the Central Valley.I hope Chris will write a sequel to this book. At the rate he's going he's going to be as good and prolific a writer as his mother, Anne, who is my favorite author."
2,Light was a HUGE disapointment,"I have read the other two Chris Rice books - so I bought ""Light"" and jumped right into reading it. I also paid full price I wanted it so bad. There were 10,000 different character, I could not keep track of who was who. I had to keep fliping pages back. This made us gay men look bad - which some of us are, but girl, this was trash!"
3,I got lost.,"I enjoyed immensely the two previous books of Christopher, and I really made a sincere effort with this one, but I got lost; too many characters, too many names, too complicated. Is it just me?"
3,good writing; bad book,"I originally thought ""oh, maybe this is his first book...I'd like to see how his writing matures as he learns economy of words, clarity of plot"".....then I found this was his 3rd novel, so he should already know better. Too many characters, too confusing, and reading this felt more like punishment than pleasure. The crafting of words was done well, but ultimately they just don't come together to form a good novel."
1,VANILLA,"Wow, I wanted to like it. I forced my way through the first 100 pages, but I just couldn't do it. This is not the first time this has happened to me with a Christopher Rice novel. I find him so VANILLA. JUst bland."
3,"The writing is better, but.....","This is Rice's strongest book so far, but the plot is too convoluted, which results in the book running too long by about eighty pages. Some of the characters could have been developed better(I found myself going back pages in order to better recall certain characters). And there are just a few plot contrivances too many for my taste - leave that to Charles Dickens. This is beach-reading material, not a must-read book."
4,"A bit of a morbid, but fun read","Well, I devoured yet another Rice novel. This book left me feeling quite sad. No one really came out on top. The descriptions of torture left me feeling that maybe I should keep my fingers where I can see them. I couldn't help but feel that maybe, just maybe, this story might have had more depth had it been written from the perspective of one of the children who was abducted rather than some twinky two-bit recovering alcoholic gay boy.I have to say I enjoyed Chris's earlier works more so than this, but it is hard to find a lot of good gay writing these days.If you did like this novel, I would recommend picking up Jim Grimsel's Boulevard... that book is awesome."
1,Same old story,"I concur with the criticisms already posted, but add one more. Light Before Day is but one more in a long, and very tired, line of gay lit that focuses on the travails of gay pretty boys living the life. Narrow, self-centered, and blessed with stylish, if not always high-paying jobs, these characters are always expected to pique our sympathy as they bemoan their plight. Violins, please.News flash! Most gay folks don't live in the ghetto (who can afford it?), have great jobs, or stop traffic when they walk down the street. Yet they hardly exist in most books about ""our"" community (whose?). How much of this stuff must we wade through before we find a Jim Grimsley or Joseph Hansen?I note Rice now lives in West Hollywood. Not encouraging."
2,Christopher Rice disappoints in his third outing,"I have been a huge fan of both Christopher Rice as well as his mother Anne Rice. It was with much anticipation that I picked up his latest to read. This was was a departure from his earlier efforts that were more horror and gothic than crime thriller.The book was definately readable however I have to agree with the prior reviews. There were too many charactors and it was hard at times to keep them straight ( no pun intended as most were gay! ) I would have liked some background on Adam besides the minor details we were given.I have several friends in recovery and no one can make a recovery from alcohol dependancy as quickly as Adam.I look forward to his next book and hope he returns to his roots in gothic horror and leaves this type of mystery to writers who can better handle the genre ( Micheael Connelly, Jonathan Kellerman)"
2,A departure from something good...,"Rice's third book to me was as disappointing as finding out his mother was no longer continuing her Vampire Chronicles. Another Rice letdown after being such a huge fan. Christopher's departure from a more dark, gothic type of mystery has left me bored and disappointed. Alone, Light Before Day may be a decent novel but in comparison to his previous work is lacking something special. Rice has taken me to a world that is as shallow and unfortuantely as incapable of drawing me in as West Hollywood itself. A suggestion for Rice would be to move back to New Orleans and recapture the mystique and darkness missing in this novel that was all too present in his first two novels."
3,Grim Underbelly,"I don't think I've ever read a book before that had not one likable character, yet I still ended up, well liking is probably not the word, but appreciating it. A big departure from the Goth meets ""Dawson's Creek"" angst of his previous two novels, this comes off more like something gay mystery writer John Morgan Wilson would have penned. A handsome gay journalist has a recent ex who seems to have disappeared. Or was it murder? This is only the tip of a dense and at times quite convoluted plot that includes child abuse, drug and alcohol addiction, pedophilia, murder, and drug smuggling. Did I mention this is not a happy story? Still, I think Rice is maturing as a writer, and this is his most confidant and assured work yet,even if the subject matter and despicable characters may turn alot of people off."
5,Great read,"Christopher Rice is an amazing author. I have all but one of his works, and that is next on my list."
2,Disappointed,Was really looking forward to this book but it didn't hold up. The plot was all over the place; too many characters; and at times too confusing. The plot twists that were jaw-dropping in his first 2 books are completely gone here. Hope he does better on his next one.
2,A disappointing offering,"I was a big fan of Christopher Rice's first two novels and anxiously awaited his third. I don't know what happened between novel two and three, but this offering is bitterly disappointing. Rice seems to be trying to do just too much in this novel. The story lines are multiple and confounding; half the time I had to go back and reread sections to remember who the characters were. Layer upon layer of story lines were just too much: Internet mogul disappearance, West Hollywood serial killer, closeted marine suicide, kiddie porn ring, central valley meth trade, etc. What does it all add up to? A tiring mess.I hung in there 'til the end just to finish the book, but it was not easy. Much of the phrasing and dialogue was just plain stilted and I found myself cringing over and over again and reaching for a red pencil. Where was Rice's editor on this one? For that matter, where was Rice? I will not be looking so forward to his next novel."
4,Quick read,"Rice's new book is a quick but gripping read. As a fellow Los Angeles resident and frequent guest at some West Hollywood establishments listed in the book, I think Rice has captured the essence of the gay scene in that city. It's shallow, drug-addicted, and constantly filled with wannabes that will do anything to get ahead in the ""business."" One of the other customer reviews said that it didn't make them care about West Hollywood--it's not supposed to! This book marks an increasing maturity in Rice's writing, and, no, it may not be as gothic as his other ones, but those writers that don't mature and evolve become pigeonholed. Like usual, he has a lot of subplots going on in this book, but he manages to tie them all together much more skillfully. Overall, it's a good read as long as you don't go in looking for a classic novel."
2,Major disapointment after previous efforts.,"While reading this book, my interest in it became ""so light it could be blown over in a strong wind,"" in spite of the flashy ""sodium lights""."
2,A Density of Souls & The Snow Garden Part Two: Lost in LA,"I was extremely disappointed in this novel, especially after reading his first two. It was far too redundant. It was the exact same thing I had read twice before. Except this time they were in LA and everyone was attractive. I live in Palm Beach, I don't need more hotties in my life. I need realistic gay porn. Dammit. Heh, ok, kidding. But, it was just too cliche'. I couldn't bring myself to finish it, despite my best attempts. I was bored out of my mind. AND ... for back up ... my dear friend who turned me on to Rice in the first place couldn't stand the novel either and refused to finish it. So, I don't think I'm alone on this one. It's not bad ... but it's not worth reading either ... especially if you've read his other two novels. The whole time I was reading going ""been there, done that, give me NEW!!""Don't waste your time. Just re-read one of his others instead."
2,Not Rice's best work,"After reading Density and Snow, I too was eager to get my hands on Light, and even paid the full retail price at the store.... I must say though, I wish I'd waited and checked it out of the local library and saved $25. Like another reviewer, two-thirds of the way through the book, I wondered if it was written by some half-asleep rookie who had no solid concept of fiction writing. But unfortunately, the man who's work I had grown to love and appreciate really did write this utterly confusing and boring bunch of rubbish. Chris Rice really let me down with this one. I am keeping the faith that his next attempt at a novel won't be as aggravatingly dull and poorly constructed. If I can say something positive about this book, it would be.... Ahhh, who am I kidding? I can't! Don't bother with this book unless you're just curious to see what crappy writing looks like."
1,Huge disappointment,"I have been a big clutch fan for years now and absolutely loved the ""clutch"" album. I also have been fond of the elephant riders and the recent blast tyrant albums. Any of these albums are good purchases. Did not enjoy Pure Rock Fury that much and absolutely hate this album. It seems to be a compilation of old songs that were too crappy to make there albums and were never fully developed or polished. Please don't waste money on this album. Shame on you Clutch."
3,B-sides,"An excellent stand alone album for the true Clutch fan. A little more raw and maybe a touch more soul, it comes across a little rough, lacking corporate polish. I have to admit I do prefer the Pure Rock Fury version of Sink'em Low but there is, as always, lots of ear candy."
5,Easy to understand,"I am new to animation and this was only the 4th book I bought. At last I have bought a book that is not collecting dust on the bookcase. I have read this book cover to cover and know now why I was interested in the subject. Why would I want to go and do one of those numerous 'courses' that various institutions offer. This was far more enjoyable and may I take this opportunity to thank Chris Patmore, the Author. Because each page was so interesting it did not feel like I was learning. Second time around I read the book in front of PC and tried out each chapter - everything worked like a dream."
3,Better Appreciation for Animation,"I thought I'll read this book and be able to start animation. I've had the book for about a month and haven't finished it yet. It has a lot of good information but I've concluded that the learning curve is too great and have given up on my quest. I have a grewater appreciation for what goes into those snippets on UTUBE. The book itself is colorful, well printed and bound. I'm going to slack on trying to make my own animated video."
2,Pretty much crap,"I got this book thinking it would help with animation principles and some technical aspects, but it gleans over everything so quickly that the whole thing is useless. For example the chapter on Web Animation is about 4 pages long and covers Animated Gifs- Yeah, because what I really wanted to learn was how to make a looping picture of a clown on a ball. It also touches upon Flash, but its only given a 2 page spread and the only info it gives is ""Flash is good for web animation!"" This book has nice coulor photographs, but the only information it gives is stuff you probably already know like you need a camera for stop motion and that you should figure out what your cartoon will be about before making it. Oh, and apparently Angelina Anaconda is the end-all be-all of animation."
2,Nice Graphics but Not Much Else,"I was very disappointed in this book. It is a very pretty book and the illustrations are really eye-catching but there isn't much substance beyond that. The topics are handled in such a light overview that they aren't helpful to anyone who may be looking into creating their own animations. The useful material in the entire book would have only filled 2 to 2 1/2 pages. It certainly isn't a ""complete course"" nor does it pass along anything more than the most generic information."
4,Great introduction to big band dance music,"My father borrowed this album from a friend when I was about 14. He only got to play it once and his friend never saw it again. I wore it smooth and was forever hooked on big band. The arrangements are clean without being sterile. It has several clasic songs with Les's unique signature as well as a great example of what big bands were doing to ""traditional"" songs at at that time as shown by the ""Volga Boat"" song with it's trombone solo that will make you look for other trombone solos.I am soo happy to find it on CD."
3,"not bad, but not as good as the first",Too many bands put out a great first alblum then try to evolve and lose their sound. this happened to homemade great first alblum but this one is nothing special. I just gave it to my emo loving friend.
2,Keeps terrible time - maybe I got a lemon!,"This clock looks really cool. Unfortunately the second hand tick is loud enough that it was banished to the guest bedroom (I like ticking, but he doesn't). So since I never have to actually use it as an alarm clock, it doesn't matter much that the clock runs nearly an hour fast every few weeks. This is ridiculous for a modern clock, IMO. Sure looks cool though! Did I mention that? I have two other Big Ben clocks. A baby ben traveling alarm that I use in the bedroom (keeps excellent time) and a Moonbeam (also ticks too loud and glows too bright for the bedroom). I wish the electric clocks made by this company had sweep second hands and optional switches for illuminating. Enough rambling."
3,Clock review,This item is very pretty. Solid in weight. Ok on keeping track of time. Battery fits in ackwardly.
4,Nice looking clock,"I don't know about the other reviewers, but I bought this for my son & it keeps time perfectly. It does require batteries; so maybe a fresh set for those other reviewers would help.I gave it four stars because the only drawback is that the alarm is kind of a low beeping, not the loud clang I remember from my youth. But it's very easy to set, and easy to turn off. Would buy again."
4,Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Moist Wipes Tub-42 ct,I buy these as refills for about two dollars. They arent as strong as regular baby wipes that you arent supposed to flush. These have a fresh scent and work the way they were meant to. They clean much better than regular toilet paper and I use they all the time. I also use them as cleaning clothes for my face or for a quick wipe up of a spill.
2,Didn't hold up,"This grill scraper was good for about 10 grilling sessions, or about 2 weeks in our home. You would be much wiser to go down to Home Depot and buy their plastic scraper....it has survived with no visible wear well into it's 2nd full year of grilling sessions and looks like it will be good for several seasons more..."
5,Classy thermometer,Really like the look of this thermometer. I like to be able to adjust the temperature so that it reads accurately. At first the temperature reading was inaccurate because of movement in shipping. Had to contact Chaney's customer service and they were very helpful.
2,Dissapointed - low quality,"Received the thermometer a couple weeks ago and immediately hung it on the outside wall of our house. Noticed yesterday the paper layer with the numbers on it was peeling off the back of the inside of the thermometer, touching the front glass, and getting in the way of the temp needle. Returned for a different thermometer. I didn't expect much from an $18 copper thermometer - I got what I paid for....."
4,ITS Crunk to my ears,"This album is off the chains with its single I smoke,I drank it will for sure get your head bopping its put together great with appearances by Lil Flip, Juvenille , YoungBloodz and so on this is a party cd from intro to outro. If you like the dirty South then this is a perfect example of how the south gets down."
3,not as pictured,"it is anice folding grip,but it is not the one shown in the ad.it is the new style that does not go to the end of the barrel even on the short barrel revolver."
5,Awsome Floor Liners,"Husky makes a fine product. These are the best liners made, hands down! They are not mats but rather they are liners. They have an edge that is turned up to contain any spills, mud, or anything else that might tend to run off the edge. They get dirty, you dump them out, hose them off, and you are done.They stay in place very well and are molded to fit your car or truck. The tan ones matched my girlfriends jeep perfect. She loves them"
1,WRONG PARTS????????????,THE BOX WAS RIGHT BUT MOUNTING PLATE AND THE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS WERE FOR A HONDA ??????????? NOW I HAVE TO PAY TO SEND IT BACK!!! THATS BULL S!!!!T
3,Hunting,"Informative magazine, at $10 for subscription, it can't be beat. Great photos, a few too many ads for my liking, but all in all a good magazine."
1,If your buying this magazine for wonderful pictures of animals... don't bother.,"I have to admit I have not read even one article, I wanted wonderful pictures of the animals they are shooting. Yes I do understand that this wasn't the intention of the writers, but one would hope they could do more than chat about their experiences & do a little shooting with the camra as well. for this reason I give it a big fat zero."
3,Not bad.,"This book tries hard to cover alot of hard issues. The prime directive, the safty of the Enterprise and crew as well as the beliefs and how to deal with an alien culture. But in the end it doesn't really cover any in deapth. That doesn't mean it was a bad book. I have quite enjoyed reading it. The characters are good and the story always moves, never really dragging along. If you are a big fan of the show then you should enjoy this book."
2,One of the first Pocket Star Trek novels.,"I got the impression that this novel was written more at the female Star Trek audience. There is something more tender in tone, or wtiting style that makes this novel more homoginized than the few previous or 100's of later Star Trek novels.If you are looking for a less action filled, or techno-babble laden Star Trek novel, this could be the one you want."
2,"A bit simplistic, but a nice read","A ""nice to pass the time"" type of book, with am interesting preposition. A planet so remote that at night the sky is only black. No other planets, no moon, no stars. And the star of the system itself flares up every now and then with lethal radiation, thus forming a society in which those who can predict these Ordeals are powerfull, especially since they can grand and deny access to the Keeps where it is save during these periods. A few nice finds like the use of transporters as means of transport on the planet: no roads, no role for ""distance"" in their fysics. But the plot is a bit predictable, and the society with three groups gets a lot of attention in the book, but is perhaps a bit to well known nowadays. And I really missed some of the usually so entertaining interactions between Kirk, Spock and Bones."
3,Prime Time for the Prime Directive,"This is a good novel dealing with the Prime Directive, and the many challenges and pitfalls one encounters while trying to walk the tightrope called General Order #1. There is a far off race, the Enterprise being hurtled thousands of light years off course, and the dilemma of fixing the broken star ship by the only means possible - directly interfering with a culture's development.A good novel, but the character are a bit hard to follow at times. There are different classes of people on the new world, and each has a set of people that the story revolves around (which causes confusion at times)."
4,Good book,"Hey...this stuff isn't going to win a Pullitzer/Nobel, but it's good reading if you're a Trek fan."
4,Good enough to have been an original episode!,"In Abode of Life, the enterprise discovers a lone star outside of the galactic arm. The novel is an interesting account of the crew of the enterprise dealing with a society who assumed they were all alone in the universe.""Abode""may be a little lighter on action than the average star trek novel, but I thought the book was a good account of finding a ""new civilization"" and I could totally picture it as a classic star trek episode."
4,It's not pretty but it works,"The tool works pretty well but the case it comes in is pretty shoddy. The case is made of flimsy wood and it was cracked and falling apart when it arrived.I have used the two prong version of this tool that you find at jewelery dept in the ""big box retailers"" but having a three prong tool does make a big difference in how well you grip your watch case. It has both square and round attachments and all my cases (that I want to open) have square holes.If you want to change your own battery then this is a really cool tool to have."
3,good customer service,"i recently did a review for this product and clicked on the wrongthing. customer service was great, i did write that the product wasnot as sturdy as i expected but did work. i changed 5 watch batteriesas soon as i received the tool."
5,Does the job,I replaced two watch batteries in Fossil watches in 5 minutes! It works like a charm. I recommend this highly!
2,nonsense!,"the box that is shown in the picture is a cardboard box and not a wooden one. And that too was broken when i received it.its ok for the price. but thats it.Rather put in some more money and go in for a professional one.Rgds,Rushabh"
2,You get what you pay for,"This item is not a precision tool. It is a poorly constructed tool for one purpose only. It will scratch up the back of any watch you use it on. It's clumsy, its difficult to adjust, and poorly designed. The bits are not magnetized, so they fall out of the wrench when you try to use them. There are no instructions or hints for which type of bit you use on each watch style. Once you figure it out, they still don't fit well. Just skip this one if you can."
2,Will not work on all watches,the individual keys will not work on most watches. All of the keys are extremely big and the smallest key is bigger than the cuts in the watch cases and will not work. I would suggest that people better evaluate what they are looking for and what size cuts are in their watches and the size of the keys included in this wrench.
1,Poor Quality,I purchased this wrench for my Seiko watch. The product had mixed reviews but was reasonably priced so I took a chance on it. The quality of the tool is very poor. It's not surprising that it is made in China. The wooden box that it comes in is very thin and flimsy. I thought my finger might go through it when I was opening it. None of the pins that come with it fit my Seiko watch properly. The wrench kept slipping off the back of the watch. I didn't want to scratch it so I stopped after several attempts to get the back off. One of the pins didn't even fit into the wrench! Very poor quality and design.
2,"Gets the job done, but barely","The only reason I'm not complaining more, is the thing was only $7.95. So I guess you get what you pay for. But what you get is a wrench which for me the top sockets don't allow the bits to fit properly, and they constantly fall out. If you just need a wrench desperately and can't afford better, this is good enough. But if you have some more to spend, find another product. Knowing what I know now, I certainly wouldn't buy it again."
1,Useless for me,"Didnt work for me. The bits are loose enough to move in their socket. Ended up leaving a few scratches on the case back and still could not get it to open.Also seemed as though the manufacturer was in a hurry to get it off its hands. It was not even clean. After handling it the first time, I got some black powder on my hands. And ofcourse the box is a lousy. Dont be surprised if you get splinters from handling it (no one can make out that in the online pic).Will return it for sure."
2,awkward and cheap,"I was looking for a simple tool that would eliminate visits to a local jeweler who has been kind enough to change batteries in my watches for free. I ran across this item and it seemed like it would be easy to use. Wrong! It's cheaply made and difficult to use. Trying to find the ""bits"" to fit the back of my watch was a chore and they are not precisely made to be exactly the same size and shape. The first time I tried to get the back off the watch I gave up after about 15 minutes. It was several weeks later I tried again and was finally successful. Using the tool was like trying to take the back off with a pipe wrench. It's awkward and quite clumsy and I consider myself lucky to get a good enough grip that actually loosened the back of the watch. Bottom line; you get what you pay for. This item is cheaply made, difficult to use and therefore not worth buying."
1,Very poor quality,"This is one of the poorest quality tools I've ever purchased. Two of the three pins fall out of the sockets as soon as the tool is flipped over, which makes it somewhat difficult to align the pins with the watch case. However, this tool did enable me to change the battery on two of my watches so I guess it deserves one star for getting the job done (although one of the watches was badly scratched during this process). I recommend finding a higher quality tool."
5,Very Pleased,"I received this item very quickly. I needed it to change batteries in my Citizen dive watch and Seiko ""formal"" watch. The very first time I used it, it paid for itself in the money I would have spent to have someone else change the batteries!"
4,It Works!,"This is a nice little tool that instantly pays for itself, (the first time it is used.) It comes in a nice little unfinished wood box that I finished with gun stock finish. Now it looks expensive as well as works well!"
1,SE Watch Case Wrench,Would not recommend this unit. The pin adjusted with the handle did not work. Returned the unit and purchased a different model which worked well.
1,too tough to use,"this item must be for the pros. i haven't a clue how to use it. even with instructions, i find it impossible to facilitate. this came without any paper instructions whatever. when i complained, the seller sent me some email book. not helpful for me. this was a complete waste of money"
2,If you own large watches ...,Beware!!! I should have read all the reviews ... It doesn't work on large watches.
1,Loose pins,"As some of the other reviewers wrote, the pins on mine were too loose. As a result, the pins can scratch the case surface as they slip out. Oddly enough, I also had one pin on the tool that was very difficult to remove.I threw mine out so I wouldn't ruin my watches. Looking for a more durable one today."
4,watch case wrench is handy,"This was very handy and is adjustable enough to fit all of the watches that I tried it on. The wooden case makes it possible to store with all of the loose pieces. Overall, I am very pleased with it."
1,Doesnt work on larger watches,"I dont know If I will ever know how good this tool is ,because it is to small and wont work on any of my watches. If you're going to purchase this item make sure it will fit your watch."
1,no good,"This tool is no good for removing screw on backs--the pins are too loose, and will not hold in the slots on the back of the watch. Also the removable pins on the tool will not slide out of one of the holes in the tool."
1,Not As Advertised,"This tool is advertised as coming with four different sets of clamps (pins), i.e., square, round, flat and toothed to fit different watches. Mine arrived with two sets of round clamps and two sets of toothed clamps. Therefore, it would not fit my Seiko watch which requires the square clamps. Also, one of the round clamps was missing. I am returning this product. If it had come with complete sets of all four types of adapter clamps I would have kept it. Not a bad tool otherwise."
3,It's O.K.,The case wrench is O.K. quality....doesn't work on the Seiko watch I intended to use it on but hopes are it will work on something else....can't complain about the service or the price.
3,Typical chinese Made,Cheaply made but it dose work. For the price I guess it can't be beat. I only need it change the battery in my watch every couple of years. I don't think a real jeweler would want to use it daily.
4,Not Bad for The Price,"I have used this on several watches, and it works well. The case is pretty flimsy, but what would you expect at this price. The adjustments work well, and there are tips for about any case back."
3,Could use re-engineering,"The wrench does work, but is a little unwieldy. The twist handle doubles as the ""sizing adjustment mechanism"". There is no mechanism to lock it once the size is set. When holding the handle to open or close the watch case, it is difficult to not twist the handle, therefore changing the size. A definite improvement would be to either: (1)add a mechanism to lock the wrench size, once set; or (2)make the ""sizing adjustment mechanism"" separate from the handle.Thanks,rivergeek"
2,Cheap watch case opener,"These bits are loose, hard to keep them in proper places, leading to scratch my watch bottom when slipped out of places."
3,"Cheap, but gets the job done","Low precision manufacturing, case broke apart in shipping. But ultimately it was functional and inexpensive. If you only need to replace one battery or so the price it right. If you are a watch smith look elsewhere for higher quality."
1,Worthless tool,"This tool is absolutely unusable. The adjustable pieces have too much give to properly tighten to a watch back, the ""removable"" pins require significant effort to remove and insert into the poorly designed clamps, and the clamping pieces are too loose to secure absolutely anything."
3,Worked for about 3 months...,"Then it rusted solid. Don't keep it anywhere it is exposed to humidity over 25% or it will rust solid. It did work well, however, but I found it a little difficult to adjust and maintain the correct size"
2,Difficult to Use,"A set of inserts similar to sockets in a wrench set were very difficult to load until I removed wire spring. The wrench then worked, but the heads had a lot of play in them making the watch back removal difficult."
3,"Cheap price and build quality, but it works very well","Quite frankly, I was disappointed when I saw the box. I guess I expected a little bit better box (and overall build quality). It's cheap, but it works well.I haven't used a lot of watch wrenches, but this one is definitely worth the price.If you desperately need one I'd recommend it to you, but if you have the time I'd suggest that you research other higher quality options.3.0 stars only because it works well. Otherwise it'd be a 2."
3,"Not the best quality, but considering the price, it does the job!","I have a few diving watches with screw-type backs, and have always used needle-nose pliers (carefully) to remove and assemble the case back for battery changes. As I only need to change batteries every 2-3 years, this method was acceptable. However, I have scratched the back covers at times, and have often wished I had the proper tool to avoid this problem, but thought they were too expensive for my occasional need. The SE Watch Case Wrench is perfect for such occasions! It is not the best quality tool, but if the correct tips are used, and the size is adjusted properly, it works fine! Note that you must be careful with your settings and hold it down firmly enough while turning. Otherwise, it could slip and scratch your case. But it sure beats the needle-nose pliers! Great price for what it does!"
2,Eh ...,"Sort of ""yucch."" It sort of works. It also sort of wobbles and can't be locked rigidly.Which makes it sort of ""yucch.""Can you change batteries in watches with chunky cuts for the wrench. Yup. Don't expect too much finesse."
2,Mediocre Quality,This product comes in a cheap blue plastic case which looks nothing like the nice wooden storage case pictured. One of the three sockets which you place any one of the different size attachments in so you can open the back of the watch was faulty making it difficult to get the attachment in an out. I managed to get the wrench to work but quality of product is very poor.
3,Watch Opener does the job,"For the money, it's a good value. The opener itself has some flaws. It comes with several different set of ""teeth"" to work with a variety of watches. The problem is, they tend to fall out of the opener. There are three ""teeth"" to each set. You push them into the opener and then line them up with the indents on the back of the watch case. If you try to put the opener upside down onto the watch, the little teeth tend to fall out. The fix? Just hold the opener right side up and put the watch on upside down. It works and does the job. One more thing, the wooden box it comes it is very cheap balsa wood. It was cracked when I received it. Not very sturdy."
3,Nothing sesnsational but workable.,The tool set came in a utilitarian case with all the expected items. Haven't had a chance to use it as yet but expect it will be utilitarian.
3,Saves money. Needs more bit tips.,"There are not enough bits in this set in order for it to be used on a wide variety of watches. It came with four sets of bits, however it has no square tips that are needed for Bulova and Fossil watches. Check the back of your watch before ordering. The round tips will worked, but it took a lot of improvising and patience. Be sure to protect the back of your watch case with tape or covering before using to avoid scratches. A case holder tool used in conjunction with this wrench will get better results because you need to be able immobilize the watch in order to turn the wrench. I was paying $9 per battery change, at $5.10 this tool has already paid for itself, even if you use it once. I just wish that it would have come with more bit tips."
4,Add another task to the DIY do-able list,"I got this for about the price it would have cost me to get a watch battery replaced at a jewelry store. It works with the watches that I have but a friend of mine had a National Geographic dive watch that was too big for this tool. I've never had a need for more than one of the bit sets even though there are 4 different sets. The size adjustment stayed in place pretty well when turning, which if it doesn't can lead you to create some serious scratches on the back plate.I'd recommend this for a tool nut that always has to have the right tool for the job, but it's not something most people would probably use more than a couple times a year."
4,"Gets the job done, eventually","This tool will get the job done. It is a bit difficult, however. There is a bit of ""looseness"", so aligning the pins is a bit tricky. But, once you get the adjustment made, it does the trick. It will not work on any watch back that is less than 7/8"" across--that is the minimum size. But if you are patient and determined, you will succeed. It is certainly worth the cost of the wrench in convenience alone in that you don't have to go to a specialty store or jewelry store for a battery change. Just purchase the correct battery and you are half way there."
1,Poor Quality; Don't Waste Your Money,"Even at $5 this tool is over-priced. Good for scratching up a watch you don't care for. The pins that engage the depressions in the watch back are not held rigid due to the poor construction and sloppy fit of the wrench components. So first it is difficult to get the tool to hold its adjustment. Then when you apply torque the pins tilt and lose their purchase, slipping out of the watch slots and scratching the back. It looks like a Jaxa wrench, but that's all you get, looks. No performance. The wooden box is OK; might be good for storing watch band accessories or other related tools. You'll have plenty of room in the box since the wrench itself will soon be in the garbage, or tossed out the back door. Take a look at an L-G brand for around $50. Yeah, 10-times more expensive, but 100% better tool. It'll only be a $5 mistake even if you do try it. Knock yourself out. But try it first on a watch you don't mind scratching up!"
3,Does not work for Rolex.,"This watch case opener does not work for Rolex watches. It will only work for watches that have fairly large grooves (>3mm sized indentations) on them such as Fossil or Invicta. Because the adjustments are very loose and the pins can fall out, it is not very easy to use without some skill/practice/patience. While this item may be fine for the price, it is far from being a professional tool. An unsharpened scissors works just as good in my opinion. The box is nice though."
2,"Good wrench, but only for small watches","This is a good tool for woman's or small men's watches, up to 42 mm of diameter. For larger watch cases it is useless, because of the limit in opening jaws. This limit is simply to small for case back bigger than 42 mm of diameter."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"This device worked for awhile, then one of the magnetic sockets lost its power and the removable tool immediately dropped out. Since the only way to use the device was then to turn it upside down and operate on the watch in the blind, I elected to purchase a new wrench."
1,"Cheap, unusefull","When talking tools, do not go for the cheap (my mistake)This tool is almost useless, as it is VERY unprecise, and difficult do set to the proper watch dimensions.To avoid at any cost."
5,Beautiful retro clock very modern internals.,Beautifully made. Heavy. Has a progressive alarm that starts off softly so it doesn't wake everybody in the house. Has run for a year one 1 battery. Very easy to use.
4,Great Retro Clock,"This is a nice retro type clock. It keeps good time, and the alarm works well. I remember my grandparents had a clock like this, so that's one reason I purchased it. I like the analogue better than the digital, so this is perfect for me. I wish it had a ""snooze"" feature though. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
4,Quietly Good,"Kenyon's art is worth the time and energy to read and enjoy. Her poetry is soft, meditative, instantly available to readers, but like pleasant shallow waters, deep and evanescent. If you are in a quiet, still, meditative mood (or want to be), Kenyon's poetry is pleasant and relaxing."
2,I LOVE HORSES,"i got a breyer and i was so excited but the minute it came out of the package it's leg broke of, so for durability i don't think it even deserves a star."
2,Endgame,"Somewhat fun hack-n-slash, loot grabbing. Though there are a limited number of armor options after a while.The endgame stinks."
2,Swinging for the trees,well my gf and I love RPG like Baldurs Gate and such. We have been looking at this game and we were hoping for a good experience. WE started playing then THE CAMERA RUINED THE GAME!!! Don't buy this unless you want to give your right thumb a workout.The end
2,Mediocre at best,"Just too Hack and Slash for me. Camera angles are awkward at times. Plus I'm a xbox 360 lover, might have been better on xbox, I stll didn't like the game all that much though."
2,"seen it, done it","Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom is one of those games that doesn't have an inch of originality ANYWHERE. It's simply a game where you walk around slashing everything in sight. Of course, that alone is only a small bit of the problem. The main thing that makes this such a forgettable game is how the controls have a habit of not doing what you want them to do, which means, if a bunch of enemies are attacking you, good luck trying to defeat all of them. The controls aren't responsive and the whole game feels rushed. You might want to avoid this one."
4,Pretty typical dungeon hack,"This game is a good old fashioned dungeon hack. It's nice that you can drop in/out of co-op play. The game is reminiscent of the Baldur's Gate series for PS2. There are only three characters and each character has a pre-determined weapon of choice - if you're going to play as the Barbarian, you get an axe. Period. Game play can get a little repetitive at times, but overall the game is pretty well done."
3,dark kingdom,just like everyone else complains the camara sucks on this game. other than that i love it. i havent finished it yet and i would play more but i have a one year old and its hard.
2,Needs patch work & updates,This could'e been a really good game if it had some support from the publishers. It has plenty of glitches and game code errors.
2,A launch title that fails again,"This game is no fun, not even remotely. I tried to get into it, but its just not that great. The camera freaks out when you get close to a tree, because its always on auto-focus. The management menu is very tedious and its hard to find where your supposed to go, or to find out what your supposed to be doing. Truth is the Chamions series has accomplished what this game had hoped for. BAD GAME"
2,Awful game of this type....look for others less expensive and better,"This is not a good way to start up the PS3 with a hack n' slash Badlurs Gate style game. The game looks and feels like a PS2 game and the game mechanics and playability are lackluster.If you are new to this genre, look for the following games instead as they all will work on your PS3 and give you a little more enjoyment than what this game is worth. These games are each under [...]as compared to the robbery of [...].Baldurs Gate PS2Baldurs Gate II PS2Champions of NorrathChampions of Norrath Return to Arms"
3,I really wanted to like this game,"First the good. The story wasn't too general, and you didn't really get involved with your character's story too much. Combat was simple, but despite this you could implement strategies and skills more suited to specific enemies. Not too much customization, but for a 2006 game the variety isn't that bad.The bad... well, I'll try to limit what I say. First off, the camera will kill you more than anything. Early in the game during a rock chase event, just before you are clear, the camera will, for lack of a better term, ""spaz out"" and most likely you will die. Many times. Some early bosses are too easy, and some later bosses are just kind of confusing, as in you have no idea how to proceed or win. The grinder's final boss (or the last I could get too) is simple, but surviving environmental hazards just makes you give up.If you really want a game to occupy time and have a few bucks, you can buy it used. Otherwise, avoid it."
4,Worked Great,"Product looked good & has worked great. The only thing that the OEM's wires had that I wish these had is numbering on each end of the cable so that you connect cable # 1 to cylinder # 1 and to the ignition port # 1. Other than that, I have been very pleased. Amazon's pricing on these was good too."
2,DOES NOT FIT-- 24V DOHC,"Recieved this product on time and in good conditon. When purchasing this item Amazon stated it would fit my car a 24V DOHC Taurus. I give it two stars ""I do not like it"" because it is the wrong part and the Amazon parts catalog is wrong. The product is in excellent physical condition but I can not attest to mechanically."
3,Poor quality.,"When I got these wires, I noticed one of them had a broken snap ring/nipple in the boot that connects to the ignition coil. Also, there was a another snap ring just bouncing around in the box, I guess they wanted me to fix the defective wire myself. The other 5 were in good condition, and considering the price for these at Auto Zone is $45, I decided to not return them to Amazon. I rated the seller at a 3 because they either A) didn't bother to look inside the box before they mistakenly said all the wires were in good condition, or B) knew there was one defective wire and sent it as-is anyway."
4,19502 cars decorations,The decorations were exactly as described. They came very promptly and were in excedllent condition when they arrived. We used these for my mother's birthday party since she was a teenager in the 1950s and she loved them.
5,Heavy Duty Surge protector,"After looking at many options, the Tripp Lite had the best overall design. Well built unit. Have not had any problems with it."
5,Great Quality and design,Very impressed with the overall design of the device. I purchased this because I had a cheap surge protector and lightning made its way through and blew up my network card and router. The Tripplite product I had for my TV protected the TV and is still protecting my tv as well as other electronics. Would highly recommend to a good friend!!!!
4,"good music, flawed remaster job","Please note that almost all the reviews here are for the original cd - not the remastered 2 cd set. See ""Paul slop""s review for the real scoop. At least the first disc seemed to escape the clicks and other unwanted defects.One star deducted for the poor remaster job.Amazon says: ""Digitally remastered and expanded two CD edition of this 1986 album ... This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."" - No - this one is available."
3,Worth buying for BLT alone!,Having loved the BLT on Substance I had no idea that it would be a different version on this album: Absolutely gorgeous song.Rest of the album isn't bad: My favourite other track is 'weirdo' the guitar trills and harmony are simple but sometimes humblingly beautiful.
4,be prepared...,"Let me warn you upfront; you will not like all the songs on this album, no matter how die-hard a fan you may be. It is a plethora of musical curve balls, that is unsettling, confusing, amusing, and addicting. It may also be one of their most important albums, in the sense that they try so many different things instead of sticking to a safe, poppy formula, it set a precedent for them to continue to experiment in their later works. I like the fact that one gets the sense that they do not care what you think of the contents of the album; you get what they give you, and they continuously play with your mind throughout. The record scratch at the end is no less alarming when one listen's to it on CD. You will hear something that you did not before every time you listen to it, and you may never forget 'All Day Long'."
3,"Not their best, not their worst","This is one of New Order's weaker albums, after Technique, which I think was their worst. The only stand out tracks here, for me, were Bizarre Love Triangle, Paradise, and Angel Dust (my personal favorite). Most of the other songs are forgettable and/or musically off kilter. They definitely made up for it by releasing Substance 1987 after this. Other than the three tracks I mentioned, skip this album."
3,"""Bizarre love triangle"" is great, rest average","It's not a bad album, but in my opinion ""Brotherhood"" remains one of New Order's worst efforts. The band was badly messed up on drugs and alcohol in the mid-'80s, and pretty much of this album has this distant and weird feel to it. They make an attempt to go back to their punk roots, and that's why this album doesn't come up with some new sounds or great songs like ""Blue Monday"" or ""True faith"". The first half of this album contains up-tempo guitar rock songs which sound much too similar to each other. The second half is a bit more varied, featuring the hit single ""Bizarre love triangle"" and the moody ""All day long"", but even this basically beautiful song is ruined by distorted guitars and squeaky synth cascades. All in all it's not an unlistenable album, but it's a far cry from the melodic power of ""Power, corruption & lies"" or the experimental approach of their excellent compilation ""Substance""."
1,Don't waste your money,"teach yourself frontpage 2000 in 21 days ssbn 0672314991 This particular book/cdrom combo stinks. beginning with page 11 the entire chapter refered to does not exist on the cd. I have never seen such a poor job of publishing in my entire life. For 33.50,Sam's should be ashamed. I have seen comic books with more referential integrity. Its funny but when I tried to post this to Sams ""contact us"" site the application failed. The web maven probably used this book."
1,this book should get zero stars!,"as the other reviewers have already pointed out, the sample files on the CD don't exist for the very first exercise in the book! I did manage to download them from MacMillan's website but even then they didn't matcn the text. My partner was using this book to teach herself to use FrontPage, but needed my help because of the poor quality of the samples. She couldn't get past day one. Don't buy this book!"
4,Clarifiacation of all the buyers,"The CD in the book does not contain all the sample chapters mentioned in the book. Those chapters did not contained can be found... Just go into it and click the ""Frontpage2000"" book cover and you can see a download section appear on your screen. The download files contained all the sample chapters you need! If you ask me what the hell is going on of that book, I cannot give you an answer. Perhaps the Sams Publishing got some mistakes..., however, this book is a quite good instruction to the beginners of the Frontpage 2000, whether he or she has any experience using Frontpage series products."
2,Disappointing,"I was asked by the publisher to review this book, and was disappointed. I was excited by the topic and at first the story was engaging. However, only a few chapters into the book, and I found the repition and rambling to be excessive. I was determined to see the story through. Unfortunately, the end did not bring the story to a satisfactory end. There were too many story lines left hanging that didn't seem to add to the story.I was also disappointed in the main character. I have rerad books that had characters you associate with, love, hate, and despise. The main character in 'The Third Translation' did not evoke any of these emotions. I found myself bored by his background, position, and his decisions."
1,Abridged is worse,"I probably don't have much new to add, just another voice in the cacophany of boo's. I found the characters and actions in the book completely inexplicable most of the time. I'm not sure why they did half the things they did and there never seemed to be any real purpose or movement in the plot. In addition, I ""read"" this book as an abridged CD, which, I'm sure, made things worse. I kept back-trakcing to try to figure out, ""Wait, how did we get here again? How did he come to this realization? Why are they doing that?"" Most of the time I didn't get any more clarity from a second time around. I was tempted to quit an audio book, that's a first for me and at the end I just felt ripped off even though I got it for free from the library. Ugh."
2,This book was the pits.,"This books clearly was a first effort. Although the Egyptian theme is interesting, the books does not move well. It's staid and limp and I could not get beyond the middle. It was extremely disappointing given Bouderant's ""The Wettest County In The World"", which I thoroughly enjoyed. I purchased ""The Third Translation"" after reading TWCITW and had high expectations. ""The Third Translation"" moved so slowly and seemingly without purpose that I gave up. I almost NEVER give up on a book....unless it's truly a waste of my time. Clearly, this novel is that waste of time. It's lumbering and tedious. No thanks. Sorry I made this purchase."
2,"Great potential, but, failed to deliver","The Third Translation is a novel by Matt Bondurant had great potential to be a cross between Indiana Jone and the Da Vinci Code, but, it failed to deliver. In fact, it decayed into a rather dull novel with little mystery or suspense.I listened to the abridged audio book and noticed the abridgement was choppy. Perhaps the unabridged version would have been better, but, I doubt it.This is one book you can skip."
3,Entertaining,"The Third Translation is an entertaining story of mystery, translation and travel. It follows Walter, a cryptographer and archeologist through his life of obsession. Starting as a child he has been driven by ruins and finds himself middle aged, with nothing but his work and a translation that he isn't getting very far on. During his trials, he meets a girls that changes his life. He chases his career and life to rescue an ancient text.This book was sold as a new Da Vinci Code, which it is not. It was a fun story but was missing the pull and detail that The Da Vinci Code had. It is worth reading if you are not set looking for the same type of action/adventure that you got out of Dan Brown's books."
1,GoodReads,"I found this book to be among the worst 5 I have ever read.I usually remain very objective and give the author a fair shake.However when the author takes the liberty to spend 3 pages describing Walter's surroundings and the meal, while during this lengthy trip Walter's mind wanders hither & fro to various thoughts relative to his past life, then comes back down to earth in some other point in time I start tuning out.I felt he spent way to much time develing into his characters.Character development is important but greatly overdone in this partiular writing.Geez I beginning to sound like the author.Anyway I guess what I am trying to say here is that I feel this book is way to descriptive and often gets bogged down because of that."
1,Nothing like Da Vinci Code,"If you liked Da Vinci code, you will hate this book. I love the subjects of Egypt and antiquities and this book was absolutely horrible."
1,Do Not Read,I should have known I wouldn't have liked this book when I noticed the author does not use quotation marks to signify speaking by the characters. I bought this hoping for a Da Vinci Code-esque adventure through Egypt. I couldn't have been more far off in my search. The book takes place entirely in London and there is hardly any adventure at all. I could not finish this book fast enough so I could put it away and never have to think about it again.
1,Ditto C Springs,"I am seldom moved to comment on a book as my taste is eclectic and seldom mainstream. I prefer my books well-written, but in the case of Bondurant's effort, I was suckered by the jacket blurbs. Perhaps some quid pro quo was at issue here - I have my suspicions about the ethics of the publishing world - but, good grief, am I meant to take this seriously? I confess that after the mad hash-inspired dash through the backs of Cambridge into the presumably ""sausage shaped fingers"" (does Bondurant know of any other kind?)of American pro wrestlers (I kid you not), I pitched the book across the room, so I will never know if our hero managed to win the day, the girl, the Stela - but who cares? Read Phillips' Egyptologist and send Professor Bondurant back to Breadloaf. I repeat, good grief."
1,Test?,"Is this a test to see if people will still buy a book this bad? It's simply amazing that it was published, in hard cover no less. What a world!"
2,"Finish the plot, please.","The first few chapters of this book are quite enjoyable and well written. The plot is interesting and I really liked the historical references to Aswan and several Egyptian temples and the general historic background. The main character is nicely described, but things get weird when the guy starts exploring London nightlife and meets up with wrestlers and strange gothic types. This all raises suspense, but the final pay-off for me was not quite satisfying. Too much loose ends, I would say."
1,So disappointing!,"I had been holding this book on my bookshelf for several weeks, anticipating reading it. Just the cover of it is so beautiful! But when I finally did ""treat"" myself to reading it, I became more disappointed by the page. Like many of the other readers, I was waiting for something exciting to happen - something to compare it to The DaVinci Code - and I'm still waiting."
1,"Too little Egyptology, too much toileting habits","This novel has such an interesting premise, I wish that it had been written by a different author. The characters are caricatures rather than truly fleshed out and I found myself wanting to slap the main character about the head until he came to some sense. Rather than advance the plot there is too much focus on the rather disgusting toileting habits of the main character's flatmates. I wanted Egyptology with secrecy and suspense, instead I got lurid accounts of London's nightlife with cartoonish characters and actions. I couldn't even finish the book. Pass on this one!"
1,The Third Translation,"Granted I didn't make it past page 50, but this is a stinker. The writing is awful - repetitive and trite. Thankfully, I didn't actually purchase it. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Laborius translation,"I don't typically write reviews of books, I would just rather read and enjoy. However this book was truely dreadful and I think prospective purchasers should hear my comments before spending their money. I found the book tedious, self-centered and focused more on an adolescent romp through the drug and alcohol fueled night life of London. Unfortunately I was hoping for something closer to a ""Rule of Four"" intellectual puzzler.Not a mystery, not a suspense, not even a reasonable ending. Buyer beware."
1,Shallow,"Don't trust what you read on the dust cover. This book isn't very good. The author, I'm sure, has a real interest in Egyptian history, and the history of heiroglyphic translation, but that doesn't make for a good story. The characters aren't engaging, the plot plods, and the lame ending wraps up the story line in a few cheesy pages.This is not a ""deep"" book. The discussion of translation is superficial and repetetive, and other areas of study, such as physics and relativity, are mentioned only in passing. There is no real detail here. We never go beyond the simplest disussion of translation, and I finished the book knowing very little about heiroglyphics. It gives the novel a ""Cliff's Notes"" feeling - we're just skimming the top of a more profound body of knowledge."
2,Missed the mark,"This book had so much potential! A mysterious Egyptian artifact with an undecipherable code, intrigue, mayhem...but boy, did it not live up to my expectations. I learned more about the London party scene than I care to and very little about ""The Third Translation."" I actually finished it, hoping it would get better as I turned the pages. But, alas, it did not. I ended up skimming the final couple of chapters."
1,A book that goes nowhere.,"Abyssmal. It is missing all the qualities of both literary fiction and pop fiction. The main character does nothing, the stories go no place. There is no conclusion, no real plot, the characters aren't even remotly human. Most are nearly cartoons. The most human in the whole thing are the two female grad students whose main activity seems to be making bad coffee. The egyptology parts are pointless. The main excitement is a row-boat chase scene. There was such potential here, particularly with their secret society, which disappeared after a single moment in time.This book gives hope to all authors; if someone will publish this, pretty much anything else has a chance."
1,Simply a bad book,"I really wanted to enjoy this book based one the subject matter, but the book is poorly written. Don't waste your time."
1,"Good potential, bad book","As just about everyone else has stated, this is a very boring book. I think one problem is that there is nothing at stake. This character has to find some inconsequential relic or his career will be ruined. Career? He appears to be some kind of perpetual graduate student."
2,The Novel is Lush...But the Da Vinci Code it is not.,"I write my first review only to warn the prospective buyer to know why it is that they are purchasing this book. If you want to read a beautifully written character study of a truly pathetic individual, knock yourself out. But if you are looking for a Da Vinci Code redux, wow will you be disappointed.Picking up this book under the wrong pretext will leave you wondering when something is going to happen, and leave you unable to appreciate just how well written it is."
1,HORRIBLE,"Nothing left to say. Horrible. NEVER develops. Wanders aimlessly into topics that add nothing to the story. No clue what the plot was. After being tempted 2 or 3 times to just give up, I finally did. Worst book I have read in years....I guess there was something left to say..."
1,What a waste of time!!,"I too was excited to read this book, but it was a giant disappointment. It is nothing like the Da Vinci Code! In the end, nothing ever really gets solved and you really don't care by then - in fact you are just very happy that it is over."
1,Pessimistic Disappointment,"Yes, it is full of factoids about ancient Egypt and Egyptology, and yes, there is a code and a conspiracy. But the writing is so pessimistic, from the characters and their behavior to the descriptions of the city around them. And the plot seems to run out of steam, the resolution hoped for in a novel of this sort just sort of fizzles. Overall, very disappointing and worth skipping."
1,Worst book I have ever read,"This book is from cover to cover awful. I am actually ashamed to admit that I finished this book, I just kept thinking 'It has to get better and have a great ending, has too.' But no I was wrong, the ending as with the whole book is horrible. This book has a plot (and I use that term very losely) that jumps all over the place and in the end makes no sense. There are references to Egyptian history and mythology scattered throughout the book that add nothing to the story and only serve to confuse the reader. This book leaves so many threads at the end of novel that it seems imcomplete. The characters are poorly described and you feel no connection to them, and hence do not care what happens at the end of them. I realize this was the author's first novel and frankly it should be his only work."
1,So Awful that I gave up !!!!!,"I only got about 75 pages into this thing when I just put it down and vowed not to finish. Unfortunately that's an hour and a half that I'll never get back !Thankfully I didn't waste my money.....Thank God for libraries !!!! MY biggest gripe with the book, Matt Bondurant apparently never learned about ""Quotation"" marks! I found it very hard to follow even the flow of his ""conversations"" between characters.Please do not waste your time or your money on this one !"
1,Third Translation not worth it.,"I ""read"" this book on CD while driving. The premise (egyptologist trying to ""solve"" meaning of ancient artifact gets caught up in international intrigue) is interesting, but the plot development and writing are terrible! Very amateurish writing. All the characters' words and actions are chaotic and inexplicable. The story lurches from scene to scene with no sensible order. Let's put it this way, the author want's us to believe the plot, situations, and characters are plausible, yet none of them are. No one would respond to the events in this story the way the protagonist and other characters do. While there are a few ""moments"" of the story that are interesting in themselves, the story as a whole is extremely flawed."
2,Confusing and muddled.,"Ok. I didn't like this book. I'm actually surprised I finished it. The prose itself was fine. The teaser story line of the Stela of Paser was intriguing. But after that, I just couldn't understand the motivations of the main character and the present day Egyptian cult. What was worth killing for? I'm a careful reader, and I missed it. And what is this character wasting time on when he should be at work translating? I was just shaking my head the whole time. The pacing was fine, but it just seemed a mess."
1,Seriously weird,"Very disappointing; nothing whatsoever what I was expecting...WHY was it linked as a Da Vinci type. Protagonist Walter not well developed and frankly by half-way thru the book I really didn't care what happened to him. At least in the last chapter the author sort of tied together the plot. And, is it really likely that a middle-aged Egyptologist, an ivory tower type, would just keep on going after his awful face injury, spit lip, broken glasses, blood-soaked clothes..???? Any normal person would go to the hospital and then the optometrist. And where in the story does Zenobia belong??? Don't buy it; if you want to read it check it out at the library."
2,cset math single subject,"This book does not prep you for the cset very well. It does not follow the test guidelines on the cset website. It seems the labeled ""skills"" that need to be practiced are from an old test, and the publishers just re-titled the book. It does give review of the math topic areas stated, but not to the extent of the cset's expectations."
1,CSET math 7-12,"the text itself has a lot of typo and little mistakes. it does not target the mean points for the test. plus, it does not inculde practice problems for the non-multiple choice part. I didn't do well on the written part of the test becasue this textbook never mention there any of those."
1,Very poor prep book,"Just seems like any random math review, doesn't touch on what will be on the test, how it's formatted, and what we'll need to know and how to apply it on the test. Waste of money."
4,"Mutants, Machineguns and Mayhem, What you expect from Blade.","Blade and the rest of the Freedom Force blast their way through 2 seperate stories in this double header of carnage and grisley fun. In the 1st story Blade and friends travel into the San Diego ""Dead Zone"" a ground zero bomb crater from the 3rd world war. As the story progresses sadistic carnage and sly wittisims accompany a easily read storyline. Not overly complex but fun none the less. In the second story a madman is set out to destroy the alaskan pipeline and, you guessed it, Blade is there to stop him. Snowmobiles, Automatic weapons and the spilt contents of human dominate this slaughter on ice. Another murderous rampage a la Blade. All and all this double dose of death is a good deal and a fun read. All the Chaos, Mutants and bullet wounds you can fill up on in a sitting."
3,I expect more from Deloria,"I really expect more from Deloria. After a very strong and provocative opening, the book quickly dives into a series of vignettes that make you say ""that's interesting"" but fail to push you to the same level of questioning one's framework. If this were his first book coming out of school this might be okay, but as an established academic, we should ask more of him. Good photos and good ideas but better suited to the undergraduate introductory class to Native Americans."
4,An Excellent Read,"This book is truly a worthwile read, and the information within the book can be applied to many areas of life. I'd recomment this book as it's a real useful tool. I like the resource lists in the back, as well. Great authors!"
1,Worst Cable ever!!,"This cable has broke 3 times in 3 weeks. The first time it broke I opened up the end to see what was going on and was amazed on how thin and cheap the wires are that make up this cable. The solder connections had broke off and I wasn't surprised because they were done so poorly. The plastic that's used on the ends is also super cheap. Save up you're money and buy something nicer. STEER CLEAR OF THIS ""VALUE SERIES"" CABLE!"
1,Just poor quality cable,"This cable is terrible. 3 months of use, probably 20 gigs, and it's done. stopped working, and i opened up the connectors, and all of the solder joints were barely attached. really thin gauge wire too.I expected a LOT better from Audio Technica. I bought it specifically because i didn't want a crappy, no-name cable. I probably would have been better off with a no-name one."
3,Great short game,"It is a great game. My son loves it.He finished it within one hour, but keeps repeating it"
2,Le hace falta mas dificultad,"Mi hijo de 3 años logro completar la mision en 1 hora, y luego de repetir el juego un par de veces lo dejo."
5,Awesome,"Best Quality, Price and service on the market. This bag was perfect for the summer beach trip getting us there, as well as for drinks and snacks on the beach. I was then able to use if for fish filets after a great day of off shore fishing.Love the thermal bags!!"
1,Smartdigital USB Repeater not 2.0,"I just bought two of these. They do work but the throughput is slow. USB 2.0 is supposed to allow for up to 480 Mbs, while USB 1.1 allows for between 1.5 Mbs to 12 Mbs. These cables clearly state on the back of the package that they support 1.5 Mbs to 12 Mbs max. Thus they don't perform as 2.0. What this means is whatever you have hitched through this thing will be slowed down; example, I tried to put my webcamera on it (which does 24 Mbs) and my movements are slowed down noticeably.If you look at the cable connector box, they have stuck on a little sticker that says ""USB 2.0"" in red. The sticker tries to make it look like that was printed on the connector along with the rest of the labeling. Basically, everything points to this being mislabeled, previous generation product. If you want USB 2.0, and you should at this point in time, you should buy another cable, not this one."
5,Good quality.,Good quality USB extension cable that works. Tight fitting connections. No noticeable drop in speed. Does as advertised. Had bad cables in the past but no need to worry with this one!
5,Great for Little Kids!,This pool is a great size for little kids. Lets them cool off without parents having to worry as much as with larger pools. It works great if you're looking for something to use with play balls too. Plus inflatables have more of a chance of being reused for several years. The hard sided pools are harder to assemble multiple years.
4,Great time for my daughter!,"I bought this for my daughter who is 18 months old and uses it twice a week at least.So far it's still in great condition, I like the fact that the bottom of the pool is not slippery at all, so my daughter has a lot of fun when she is walking and playing standing up,the pool is also big enough for me to sit inside and play with my daughter! this is his wife writing."
3,Cute baby pool,"This pool, like most or all on here, has a regular bottom. My Mother0in0Law had gotten one last summer for a little less from a local store and it lets you inflate the bottom, so there's more cushioning for the kiddos. I really wish this had it, but it seems most if not all on here don't. It did well our first time and I expect it to be fine the next times."
4,Great for the price!,"My husband and I bought this pool for to use as a ball pit for our 12 month old daughter. So far it seems like a good blow up pool, and we love the color's of it much better than the one shown in the original pic. We did not have a pump to blow it up with but it did not take long at all (aobut 10 min) to blow it up by mouth (we took turns). We bought 200 play balz to fill it with and for her age that is plenty, but we will add another 100 balz when she is a little older."
3,"Inaccurate Amazon page, not safe for under 3 years","Ordered for our 14 month-old based on the ""12 months"" manufacturer recommended minimum age on the Amazon page. Product arrived with ""For Ages 3+ Years"" and ""Warning: Choking Hazard - Small Parts"" type warnings plastered all over it. Guessing some toddlers bit off and choked on the inflation spout or something like that so they have recently had to revise the age range but didn't update Amazon with the change.In any case, returned it and can't attest to its quality, this is just a warning that it's not actually safe for the age range Amazon claims."
2,Ying Yang Garbage,Aviod this CD. What happened to Ying Yang Twins? This is a CD that belongs in the garbage rather than the CD player.
2,Youve heard it all before,"im not a kid but i do know good music when i hear it and this is not it. this so rehashed and just not fresh at all. chorus about girls and their body parts.....verses about girls and their body parts....track 2 blatently rips off Ms New Booty, and the rhymes are nothing you havent heard before......overall just a whack effort. i wouldnt even recommend this for a party cd, unless you wanna make everyone clear out. these guys need to get a real job, which probably means working at Burger King."
3,maybe a two and a half,"only two and a half three bececasue besides a select few songs from like 1 to 10 there just not good, there tryign to do someting else...and then from 11 to whaterver it goes to is pretty good, proably about 80 percent of those songs are good so its a so and so cd but definalty worth picking up if you a fac of ying yang,"
4,Good Album....,I like the ying yand twins songs and this album does not disappointment me.. good workcouple songs are extremely goodthankskiran
1,exlax in my stomach,"Oh there definitley is a balance with the chemistry that is going on in this album. It is the chemistry of a WHOLE box of exlax mixing with my digestive system and the aftermath that arrives in my toilet. This is what occurs when I listen to the lyrics of the ying yang twins. The beats are hot, don't get me wrong. But a song is incomplete when it doesn't have any good lyrics to go with that beat. So that makes an album of incomplete songs because every bar that dribbles off the crusty lips of the ying wack twins are no better than a bar my son can spit. Buy an instrumental of this album and avoid making your eardrums hurt by hearing the lyrics."
3,Sturdy and sharp,"This is a very good peeler with a nice sharp blade. Works very well. My quibble is that the handle design is not the most comfortable I've ever used. It does, however, make it easy to hang up on my WMF tool caddy's hooks. If I were peeling ten pounds of potatoes, I might think twice about this one, wish I'd gotten the WMF and given it a try, it has a cylindrical handle like the rest of their tools."
4,very good item,"Was well pleased with everything.The only thing I have to say is,customers should be reminded that when ordering boots, they should order one size larger.Most boots are cut smaller than regular shoes.So, if you wear a size 9 you would order a size 10. Thankyou. sincerly,miamiman53"
3,Laces Too Short,The boots are great but the laces are obviously meant for someone with toothpick legs. We had to go out and buy new laces. They really need to make the laces a little longer.
2,customer service not so helpful,"We ordered these boot for my husband to wear for our wedding and the lace broke as we were lacing them up...we called to replace the laces...and they wanted to charge us an additional $10.00 for laces...or we can send the boots back and wait for replacement boots which was not a good idea since our wedding was in 2 weeks, they weren't helpful at all...I ended up getting new laces from a local store and paid out of my pocket..."
5,Cool,"what more can I say, than cool show? Well I can say if you like the geeky world then you will love this."
2,"Poor quality DVD---Better after exchanged, but not good enough","I love The Guild, however I absolutely hate this DVD. This manufacture on demand DVD-R is horrid. Between my 2 computers, PS3, and 3D Bluray player I have 6 ways to to play this DVD and each reproduces the same problems. When each episode starts the audio takes a few seconds to start so parts of dialog are missing and when the episodes end it cuts off a few seconds. Example of this is the end of episode 5 when Tink and Codex kiss, Bladez turns around sees them and does a spit take. The whole spit take is cut off. This is a major unacceptable flaw to me. I'll be exchanging this DVD in the hopes I just got a bad copy.The replacement DVD-R plays a lot better then the first one, but still has a couple glitches with it. I'm shipping back the replacement and waiting for a normal production run DVD."
5,Awesome show,"This show kicks. I loved it the moment I first seen it. This is a must have for any gamer or lover of games.Trust me you'll be laughing your self with each minute. Or you'll have a ""I went threw that, when I played games"" moment like I did so meny times."
5,"It's The Guild, of course it's Awesome!","Yet another incredible job by Felicia Day and her guild of miscreants. This is a great continuation of an amazing web series. I love Felicia. Her writing for the series is hilarious and she has yet again assembled a great cast and crew to produce another wonderful season of one of my favorite shows. If you've never watched this so, what are you waiting for? Go check it out!"
5,just keeps getting better,Road Trip! who would have thought that being stuck in Vork's van could be so entertaining. Wonderful cameos from has beens and almost were's.
3,Still haven't corrected the sound issues.,"I love The Guild, and really enjoyed season five, but the sound problems on the DVD are still present, sadly. (The first 30-90 seconds of many of the episodes are damaged.)"
5,Tremendous ladies,These 3 ladies have tremendous talent. I bought this as a vinyl album when it came out in the early 1980's. It popped into my memory and was very happy when I found it on Amazon in CD form. I am once again singing along as loud as I can !!!
4,A Rose by Any Other Name,"Don't bother to consider the nonprofit edition. There is so little difference between this version and the Pro version that the $100 average difference in price is worth avoiding. Most of the difference, and I have both the Pro 2006 and the NonProfit 2007 versions, lies in the terminology. For instance, ""Customer"" is ""Donor"" or ""Pledgee."" Otherwise, the Pro version is pretty much the same as the nonprofit version. Save your money. The developers of the nonprofit edition were too lazy to really taylor the nonprofit version to the needs of nonprofits, since they apparently noticed little difference between the nonprofit world and the for-profit world of bookkeeping. I must admit that in actuality there is little difference, apart from tracking donations, pledges, grants, etc. Aside from these observations, I find Quickbooks to be a very fine tool for the job that it is designed to perform. Bottom line: Save the $100. Get the Pro version instead."
2,Wait until less buggy...,"There are some major issues with this version of QB being setup on a server. Apparently, there's something buggy in the proprietary software that was built into this new version. Intuit's technical support was very little help. Luckily, we have a fabulous IT guy who figured it out for us. If you have QB on a server and can hold off on upgrading, wait until later in the year when the bugs are all worked out."
1,Simply heinous...,"Okay, never mind the quality of the film itself, which is actually one of the many productions in post-apocalyptic sauce hanging (or at least trying to) heavily on the exploitation, with its easy and aboundant use of beautiful (if half naked and unlikely) female warriors in a story otherwise quite dull, and let's speak rather of the DVD itself.Scandalous, to say the least, a little more than amateur product, made on a shoestring, it consist in no more than the digitized version of the movie from a analogic source, most probably a VHS - and with a comparable quality for audio and video - without any intervention for clearing and/or restoring the film therefore also lacks the bare minimum of options that are otherwise standard in most dvd productions (someone talked about subtitles?).Avoid like the plague, it's really a waste of money."
1,Horrible! Buy the tv series- it's SO much better!,Do not sully your impression of the remarkable series by watching this awful version. Go buy series 1-4 of McLeod's Daughters and experience what quality television was before reality shows came along and ruined everything.
4,McLeod's Daughters a good movie,I liked the movie and the first two Episodes of the tv series enough to order Season 1. If there is cattle and horses and good hard working honest people I'm hooked.
1,Does not actually support the TiVo,"TiVo is listed as a supported device but the functionality is not complete. You can't actually step up and down through the menu items one by one, making the remote completely worthless for use with a TiVo. Also, the support website site printed on the back of the packaging does not work, it appears to be misconfigured.The remote does not have dedicated cursor up/down keys, there's a 'menu' mode you must enter first. For the TiVo, the menu mode button is mapped to the program guide and so there's no menu mode for the TiVo, again, making it worthless."
4,Great Series But Read the Manga,"I would have to disagree with the idea the TV series is taking a break. Inuyasha ended in 2004 in Japan. Its not uncommon for anime to get ahead of the manga ""comic"" they are based on but usually to deal with this the anime develops a different story arc hence one of the major reasons the two mediums differ. You will see this if you follow Bleach on TV and in the manga when it finally catches up in the US. In addition they are well into 50 chapters in Japan and the TV series ends around chapter 36 or so. If they wanted to animate the material is there. It could come back but its been sometime so just seems like you wouldn't take so many years in between runs. A lot of anime series end well before the manga does. Either way enjoy the series but treat yourself and read the manga the depth in the reading is great and really fills the story out."
1,jip,I feel ripped off.30 bucks a pop per dvd at 55 volumes and they just end it like that.How many years til they even bother to start it up again?
4,The so called ending...,Well the end of the anime series wasn't what I thought it would be. Nothing was really resolved just a bunch more episodes that would have been. Maybe Takahashi-san got tired of it. But I wish there was more. But It was good I guess.
3,An Expanded Linksys Manual,"This would be an excellent getting started guide if it was included with a Linksys product, but it is disappointing as a separate purchase. Most of the step-by-step instructions presume that you have purchased a Linksys product. If you use another brand, this book may not give you much help. Even if you have a Linksys product, don't expect much coverage of intermediate or advanced topics. For instance, the book mentions remotely controlling a network computer, but it doesn't explain how to do it other than to briefly mention a few programs. I was expecting a little better coverage based on the previous reviews."
4,shortcut to molecular&biochemical parasitology,This title and topic is updateTherefore is not completeThere are many things about biochemical&molecular of PARASITESThat is unknownBut this work is very worthly.All the bests.
4,Fairly detailed,This book isnt overly long and filled with over the top water gardening items most people cant afford. The applications discussed a common and to the point. Thecontenet isnt bad for a beginning pond builder but you can gather most information from the book from websites online like pondmegastore or lilypons.Beginners & Novices go ahead.
2,same old info...,"Just like most of the garden pond books we see, this book recommends invasive plant species such as parrot's feather. If these authors are so knowledgeable, why do they suggest using noxious weeds in water gardens when they should know this is one of the main avenues for the spread of these plants?When an author who isn't just a transformed hobbyist writes a book, I will buy it. I will pass on this one, thanks."
2,Two the Ten Bulbs Bloomed,"Two of the ten bulbs bloomed, each with only one flower. A little disappointing to say the least. Here's hoping next years blooming will be a little more productive and worth the expense of the bulbs."
4,JR's Second Cookbook Review,"The Good:Good for beginersThe recipesStep by stepLearn more about Jim RossCons:No recipe intro like Can You Take The Heat? The WWE Is Cooking!No recipes from current WWE Superstars.Only for WWE fans who love food and love to cook.The Bottom LineGreat cookbook, but no recipe intro"
3,Identity crisis?,"Better known to Mott The Hoople and Widowmaker fans by the non de plume ""Ariel Bender"", Luther Grosvenor (who had used his ""real name"" during his earlier stint with Spooky Tooth) released this solo effort in the mid-70's. The album has a loose, ""home studio"" feel overall (although it should be noted that Edsel does a nice job with the remaster.) Guitar fans will likely find ""Under Open Skies"" more collectable than casual listeners, as the fretwork is excellent, while the songs (and vocals) remain somewhat lackluster. Grosvenor holds his own alongside contemporaries like Chris Spedding and Mick Ronson, who also excelled as sidemen but tended to deliver more workmanlike product as solo artists."
4,Opens right up come mid-album,"The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is cause I find the beginning first three tracks just kind of so so. But song 4 however suddenly hits the note - ""Love The Way"" is a great tune, and all of the songs that follow suddenly seem to become excellent. Even the two bonus tracks more than hold their own. This is a nice album that I wouldn't part with."
4,Should appeal to non-Cat Power fans,"When I first heard Cat Power, it was her song ""Rockets"" (although I didn't know it at the time). Immediately turned on to the sound, I started to listen to anything I could by her, but they were all songs from her various other albums. I didn't really like what I heard - her other songs still have her haunting vocals but with a finger-picking style guitar in a more ""folky"" vain. Eventually, I was able to hear the songs on ""Dear Sir"" and it was exactly what I was attracted to in the first place. The music has more sparse, heavier distorted guitar work, slightly reminscent of early Sonic Youth. The resulting music is like hearing a ghost wail over the grindings of machinery.If you've heard of Cat Power vicariously from interviews of other artists or other plugs in print, I highly recommend this album to be your first excursion."
3,"not the best, but still ok","So you're into Cat Power all of the sudden and want to get all of her albums? Hey? Well, this one is only for the fans. If you like 'Myra Lee'you should like this. But still, Myra Lee is a better album. Anyway this one has the infamous 'rockets' song, which is also on the myra lee cd. It's awesome to say the least, and one of those songs that you'll suddenly sing in the shower on any day! Itchyhead, the sleepwalker and headlights are also good songs. And 'mr gallo' is slow, but extremely intoxicating. Note: Only for the fans."
4,Not bad for dvd-r,"malone,by good old burt,came out in 1987,yes it/s in dvd-r[manufacture on demand]but it has a very good picture,dark scenes show a little grain,but hey,this picture is 25 years old.It/s in 1.85:1 or 16.9.It should play well on up to date dvd or blu ray players,this is a good action movie for It/s time,This is my third dvd-r movie and had no trouble at all,with either of them, may not get no extras,but no big deal to some. so if you like Burt Reynolds,go for it,and buy it,audio sounds good,you may never see this in blu ray,some movies haven/t even may it to dvd?"
5,Action flick galore,"Great action flick for those who like justice. An land baron who wants to take over a valley, a sheriff who's not nice, A gas station owner who's willing to let Malone spend the days at his house while his car gets worked on, and his daughter who works there as well. Along with the land baron's henchmen, you got a movie that will be good for generations. Malone does not like people who aren't bully others and that's the point of the movie."
5,"One of Burts Best,.......I wish he'd made a sequel","One of Burt's Best, I wish He'd made a sequel.This movie is equal to his great Movie called Deliverence, Malone is wonderful to add to my collection"
3,[Three and a half stars out of five] Burt's best since Stroker Ace!,"After breking his jaw filming City Heatw/ C. Eastwood in late 1983, Burt had torecover then starred in several bad onename movies (Stick or Heat being theworst!) - but then came this little ap-preciated film! Kenneth McMillian andCliff (PT-109) Robertson are very goodin here too. Neat ending with burningVA drivers license, which reminds me;I need to renew my VA drivers licensethis Friday. Enjoy this film - MAN LAW!"
1,None,"This was a very well used movie, most of it jumped and shook but I was able to at least finish it. Then throw it away....."
2,Uhm.....,"I bought this video because of all the extras & I just love Leslie Sansone. It arrived on time, but that was the only good thing about this purchase. I love the DVD, this review has nothing to do with the DVD itself. Leslie Sansone is an amazing person & she really knows what she is talking about. She is my favorite by far. BUT, why I am giving this only 2 stars is because, when I got it, the package was all beat up & dented. & it appeared the DVD was already open..... So, I'm not pleased with that. Everything else was great & I LOVE LOVE LOVE Leslie Sansone."
4,A close view of the MiG-29,This is book that I enjoyed reading very much when the MiG-29 was very much of a mystery. The book has many valuable photos and colour plates and the text is informative. But it is now a little dated thanks to the openness of since the end of the Soviet Union and there are now more up to date books which cover this very capable fighter
4,Where's Showtime?,"Ok, I'm biased. I'm a trombone player. And the sometimes musicians have to move on to other things. I understand. I do, however, miss their trombone player a great deal, as he had a style and intensity unlike many others. Some tracks just scream for one of ""showtime""'s raging, strident slide rides. It's a shame. The album, however, wicked. MMMUCH better than their last effort: ""Evolution"". No doubt many will give it 5 stars, yet, when it comes to MY OWN enjoyability of the album, I give it 4 due to large void throughout the album in which trombone should be giving bottom and cajones to the horns."
4,"A ""Must Have"" for the any collector.","If you're just starting a collection, an antique dealer, or have been collecting for years, you will want a copy of this book. From the front to the back cover, it is full of valubale information about the pottery. It took about six years of research to put this book together which includes interviews conducted by the author/publisher with Mr.Jim Dryden, his family, friends, and former employees, as well as pictures of Kanzas and Arkansas pieces and a price guide. It does come with a CD Rom, which is great ""IF"" you have a computer. Personally, I didn't care for the ""soft cover"" and the black & white photos. But if you're going to collect the pottery, the book is a ""Must Have!"". Happy Sales & Happy Trails."
3,Ok for a GRAYSCALE book,"I bought this book for the information about the pottery as a collectors item and as a price guide. Be aware that the photos in the book are not in color, had I known this I might not have paid so much for it. It is a wealth of information about the Dryden family and the company, but if you are used to glossy full color pages in your price guides this book will disappoint you. It includes a CD with an Acrobat file in full color and the photos are beautiful... I wish they had published the book in color... again, for the price, that's what you'd expect."
5,Hot Club Paradise !!!!,"Bireli Lagrene, along w/Florin Niculescu, has put together a HOT band / tour that successfully recreates the Hot Club vibe of Django Reinhardt & Stephane Grappelli... Bireli & Florin provide tons of fun w/ great soloing over a really full rhythm section that just BURNS a groove... one of the BEST-EVER modern gypsy jazz recordings !!!! catch their live show when its' caravan comes your way- it's the real deal !!!!"
1,Sub-sonics,"Must strongly go against majority opinion here, as these dreadfully droning depressives have little to say but project their own vacant misery."
5,great diversion,"Excellent show. Not for everyone or for every moment. But when something a little odd is what you want, this show fits it. Pee Wee is strange and interesting at the same time. The charactors are pretty unique and the ""story"" each show is quick paced and constantly changing so kids never really lose attention. It also helps if there's some part of the show you don't like since you can wait 2 minutes and it will move to something else.Definitely woth having in the collection. Price was cheap for a great quality set that is a must have in the library."
5,Classic Pee Wee part 2!!! Season's 3 thru 5 in one great box set from Image!,"Great job Image Entertainmnet!!! This great 5 DVD set picks up where the fisrt set left off!!! Now it's available at a ""pee wee"" price,so it's very affordable!!! Classic fun for the whole family! Get this before it goes out of print!"
3,Great stories,Picture quality leaves a LOT to be desired. NOT HD...at all. Very grainy. Classic odd Pee Wee stuff but takes away with the lousy picture quality.
5,just what I wanted,perfect condition...couldn't find in any store...I expect the stores are a little shy about selling it because of Reubens deal a few years back. Probably the best kid's show ever.
3,Christmas special missing,My boyfriend got me this from amazon.com back in 2006 or 2007. At the time there was no complete series set. Seeing that this says it has the entire 3rd season I figured it would have my favorite episode the Christmas Special. IT does NOT and I think that's a false advertisement to state that it has the complete third season and not include that episode.
4,Memories for parents,My husband and I recorded a few episodes when Pee-wee was on late at night recently. Our two year old LOVED watching. Not only was it great memories for us but she was also able to enjoy. Some kids show are just horrible to watch and you wind up watching them over and over again. Pee-wee is fun for all three of us. We bought both dvd's as a christmas gift and have enjoyed watching.
2,Disappointing Second Set,"With the exception of disc# 6 this collection was very disappointing. It was obvious that the show lost its charm after season #3 and was well on its way out before Paul Reubens little incident. However, if you liked Pee-Wee Herman the first collection under Playhouse#1 is excellent. It was fresh and innovative. My 3 year old loves the first 6 discs. Disc #7 to disc #10 are actually pretty bad and not worth the purchase. They should have included disc #6 with the first set. Anything after that was simply not entertaining. The quality of all the discs still is excellent."
3,Great TV Show...,My husband loves pointing out all the behind the scenes camera crew mistakes. It is funny watching these older seasons.
2,Disappointed,"I love this show because I used to watch it as a kid. I really liked the price I paid for this item, however,I was very disappointed with the actual product. Several of the episodes are duplicates. I felt a bit cheated because of this. Very dissatisfied."
1,scratched discs,very unhappy with season 2 open the package and discs were scratched couldnt hardly watch any of the episodes on season 2
4,Could Have Been Remastered,As some of the music score for season 2 is available re-mixed in stereo from the original masters it is a shame a stereo re-mix sound track was not added to make the program even more enjoyable.Shame also the picture could not have been re-mastered and last negative is the DVD's are flippers which I really hate.However it is still great to see Jon & Ponch in action again.I may also be wrong on this point but the menus seem to use the season 1 theme and the episodes are in Dolby Digital 1/0
3,All eye candy but little substance.....,"Well the two leads were eye candy for the female members of the TV audience, Guys liked them because they were regular joes off the job, but regretfully the scripts had little substance, although once in a while, a good story was played out. That;s it."
1,WARNING,"I purchased thee copies of ""CHiPs"" - Season 2; all three copies were defective; disc 1 contained the same four episodes on each side of the disc rather than having four episodes on Side A and four different episodes on Side B as listed on the disc jacket"
5,Jim Shore Cat Birdhouse is Wonderful!,"The Jim Shore Cat Birdhouse is adorable. It's very well made with a small ""trap door"" in the bottom to clean the inside if necessary. Just received 2 of these and love them. Highly satisfied with this item."
5,This Is The Real Thing....,I'm a Beyea and this is the real thing....I spoke with Mr. Peck when he was compiling data...my mom helped him gather some info on our mostly missing branch....if your a Beyea this is a must have to pass on to your children....
5,About the shipping set,"This breyer shipping set is very fun to play with so it will protect your model horse when you put him in the breyer tralier, I think this is educational because it shows horse owners what some horses have to wear to protect your special horse, but there is one problem first the head bummber never fits the horse's head I tried on Milton the new 2005 horse but it popped off and dosen't go back on very well I am very not pleased with the head bummber but every thing else is fine."
4,Hmm idk its good,I think Job For a Cowboy is sweet guys I dont really see a problem with it maybe a little repative but ok. I'v heard a lot brutaler like Mortician or Origin but I have to say people look at this as a Hardcore/death band I dont think death and core go at all togther. I hate hardcore and hardcore dancers. I think this is a more of a death-grind band. This is not a bad cd all very good.
1,Uninspired and Cliche,"Now before fanboys tear my review down: I like bands such as The Faceless, Bloodbath, Abigail Williams, Gorgoroth, Morbid Angel, Opeth, and one of my all-time fav's Behemoth. Enjoying heavy music IS NOT a problem for me. But all of these bands have something that JfaC lacks: Finesse.This band writes songs that don't really seem to have any direction or focus; while it would take a million monkeys a million years to write the Gettysburg, it would take 4 monkeys a day to pound out one of these awful grindfests. Job for a Cowboy's biggest problem (that they've had since nearly the beginning) is that the vocalist doesn't shut up. Can't enjoy the guitar work--there IS some good stuff in there when the drums and vocalist quits--the guy's rehashed take on Cannibal Corpse has to find its way into nearly every beat. I realize that its the band's style, but you can take and leave styles, and I leave it. I can't believe I paid for it."
2,What?,"I dont understand how some reviewers can say that Death and Core dont go together. If a ""death metal"" band plays breakdowns theyre a metalcore band. Job for a Cowboy is metalcore, not death metal. Through the Eyes of the Dead, Suidcide Silence, As Blood Runs Black, Wecamewithbroken teeth, etc are all METALCORE bands. Examples of REAL DEATH METAL: Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Morbid Angel, Carcass, At The Gates, Dying Fetus, etc."
3,matter of opinion,What is it with all u scene kids being obssesd with this band. the only decent part to this band is the vocals. even then despised icon has way better vocals. not to mention DI has way more technicality in drums and guitar. i give this band props for recording this while in high school but there is so much better death core bands out there.this ep is good to rock out to but once u pay attention to the music it really isnt to great. all matter of opinion. i would buy if u just want to get hyped up.
3,Not Bad,"The Vocals are good the drums are solid, but the gutiar is nothing two great There not the best band out there but the songs are brutal, the blast beats are cool, and often. If ur a Death metal/Metalcore fan pick this one up."
1,job for a brokeback,"I fail to see why job for a cowboy is considered technical. Most of the music is in 4/4, not to mention how incredibly basic the guitar parts are.... I saw one review calling JFAC ""dillinger escape plan"" with death metal vocals....sorry to say, that is as far from true as you can get. 1 star."
1,terrible,"the drumming is sloppy and the blast beats were rough. the singing is terrible. and considering the fact its been done before, it was pretty bad."
5,if you don't like death go away,why give this CD a bad name because of your taste in music? if you like heavy music this CD will do the trick. heavy vocals heavy riffs heavy drumming. if you think soilwork is heavy this isn't the band for you. the guys are all just out of high school i think they did a great job with this EP. 5 stars from a true death fan \m/
5,awesomely awesome,"Bought this EP yesterday after owning the the full length ""Genesis"" for a while. Different to the album, in my eyes it might even be better, but as with anything Job for a cowboy related, it kicks butt. Just buy it and blast it loud. It rocks, period."
3,First - Check it out at the Library!,"Jo Goodman is an author found on my favorites' list, but MORE THAN YOU WISHED is a miss! When I start counting the pages left in a book, I realize the story is in trouble!So what went wrong?Could it be the story's pretense was inadequate? Yes!Or was it the substandard, shrouded mystery? That too!MORE THAN YOU WISHED is Book 2 in Goodman's HAMILTON SERIES, too bad it didn't have the same ""superb"" design as its predecessor, MORE THAN YOU KNOW. Jo Goodman introduced Bria Hamilton in Book 1 and the shadows and implications of her life were well drawn, causing this reader to fully anticipate and picture her story. However, the long awaited results were pure disappointment!Grade: C-MaryGrace Meloche."
3,Less than I wished,"I read the first hundred pages and found that to be a rather laborious project. I could not connect with either Bria or Luke. The history seems to be very accurate, however, the story line falls so flat in the beginning of the book that I just could not waste my time waiting to see if things improved."
5,Best Book on this topic!,"This book thoroughly goes over how to spend, save, and make money. It has great info for the young enterpenuers with lots of scripture and devotionals scattered in between. I especially enjoyed the many job ideas for the many types of girls. A great gift idea!"
3,Suspicious,"As another reviewer has mentioned, these wicks arrived in clear plastic bag inside a blank cardboard box. I have no way to tell if they are what the seller claimed them to be.I will say that these ones did not last nearly as long as the wicks I used before. They do not have the metallic strip running through the middle like the previous wicks had. They collected dust much faster and had dark patches which looked like mold after a few nights of use.Still, they fit my Duracraft DH-830 humidifier and they did work for a while."
3,i don't think these are actual humidiwick brand...,"these lack the metal filaments the humidiwick brand has, & they suspiciously arrived in just a clear plastic baggie in the cardboard box. No box.so, i do not think they are actual humidiwick (which i have used for years & work just fine), unless humidiwick has changed their filters physically.however, they do fit just fine in my humidifiers.the reason i am giving only 3 stars is b/c i ORDERED & paid for humidiwick brand filters, not knock-offs & there is absolutely no reason for me to think that humidiwicks are what i received.will update after i have continued to use them, to let people know if they work as well as humidiwicks do."
4,Dark and Chaotic... but that is a good thing !,Counter weaves a tail that grabs you and keeps you turning pages. The ride is well worth the price of admission!
4,5 stars for the seller,"Even I give this item for 4 stars, but the seller should get 5 stars. The lens is a little cheap, and doesn't seem to have lens reflective coating. Though it works."
1,don't buy into the hype,"I don't normally review books, as my reactions to them are somewhat more emotional than cognitive and I end up sounding like I'm on some sort of high. I make an exception for this particular work of fiction not because it is so very good, but because it is not. This is one of the only 2 books I have ever actually returned to Amazon. I couldn't stand to have it in my house another second. It had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The ghost the of the tree that gave its life for the books' printing was postively screaming at me. The characters were flat, the dialogue was stilted, the relationships were abortive. If there was a rating in numbers less than 1, it would rate somewhere around there."
2,2 small for 2 people,this is not a two person boat. barely enough space for one person. i sold it and bought a four person boat that has enough room for 2 people maybe 3. companies should find another way to rate how many people will actually fit in these inflatables.
1,pieces don't stay together,"This is a great idea that is poorly executed. Because the pieces are shaped like the countries, they do not stay together the way a regular jigsaw puzzle does. This becomes very tedious for both child and adult--the puzzle comes apart every time you touch it to put in a new piece. In addition, the pieces are pretty thin--not as thick and sturdy as they should be for the price.Very educational--it is just not very user-friendly. You will need a lot of patience with this puzzle ( and all the Geo Puzzle map puzzles)."
1,Not a complete Asia Map,"I am not happy with this puzzle and here are my observations:(1) This puzzle doesn't contain all the countries of Asia. Iraq, Kuwait, UAE, Saudi Arabia are completely missing.(2) Only some parts of Iran & Russia are shown but not the whole country.(3) Pieces don't lock with each other. So when kids try to arrange the puzzle most pieces shift from their positionsI am keeping this puzzle just because I couldn't find a better puzzle for Asia."
2,Puzzle not as hoped,Good puzzle because the pieces are shaped like the countries they represent. Disappointed in the quality of this one as all the pieces are warped and twisted and so don't fit together well. Other puzzles by GeoPuzzle have not had this problem as badly.
4,Humayun Ali,"Good book to read. Specially for people who are new to finance and economics. When I read this book i was a junior in college. Lot of concepts were very difficult for me to grasp. I reread this book in my senior year and i loved the book as this book has everything, for instance Principal and concepts of all the financial institutions and different ""financial buzz words"". If you are confuse about your future carrer path in finance. Read this book and you will be sure where you want to go."
1,Whiny,"I have to agree with a previous review, this book is so whiny of the lack of research in gamma-ray bursts that I forgot I was reading a science book."
4,Easy does it,"I was to hard doing the stretch the first time, and couldn't move for a couple of days. I am still trying, but not as hard. I think in the end, it will be great because it works every part of the body."
4,Like this one,I love this one! The exercises are in segments. You can do one segment or combine them according to your needs and time constraints. I have used only the stretching segment which I find to be a very calming alternative to yoga. The stretching segment is very thorough and targets all the major muscle groups in both upper and lower body and is a great stretch after a tough workout of lifting weights. Each segmen has soothing background music. I did notice improved balance and flexibility after a couple of weeks of using this workout. I do plan to start using the breathing segment very soon since I recently learned of the benefits of proper breathing techniques in the reduction of stress and blood pressure. Each segment is approximately 10-12 minutes making it convenient to do in early A.M. or P.M. before bedtime. This is a definite worthwhile addition to my exercise DVD collection.
5,excellent for muscles,"i have had massages, chiropratic adjustments for tight(spasm) and painful muscles.i bought kathys STRETCH vhs at Thrift Store, it does the trick, after doing the entire tape my muscles feel relax and the pain is gone. these exercises can be done by almost anyone and any age they are so simple and gentle.For Me, these exercises are as effective as a neuromuscular massage."
2,Good stress reliever,"It is a good stress reliever, but I felt is was just to long. It didn't work on flexiblity as much as I had hoped. I bought this one 'cause I like working out with Kathy Ireland. I have all of her videos. This one is my least favorite, but I still try to fit it in once in a while. If it was shorter and worked more on flexibility I would have done it more."
2,Very short and too fast.,"This video shows Mika Immonen kicking butt on the pool table, he doesn't even stop and talk to you or show you what he's doing. There's a narrator in the background teaching you what each kind of shot is, they show two examples of what the shot is and then quickly move onto the next chapter. You end up feeling like you suck even more due to the fact that you don't feel like you know enough or seen better examples of what they are talking about. The videos motion graphics and sounds are way better then the examples they show.I'd say this video is more like a teaser, hey here is what we do and this is what it's called, good luck! For $30 it's a rip off. Find a better video where they show you more examples etc."
2,mastering pool review,"I bought this video thinking that it would give me some good practice ideas to improve my game. It doesn't do anything but show you what certain shots are called. The only good thing is the table runs he does at the end and that's only because you get an idea of how a pro runs the rack. Other than that, it was useless. Get Varner's DVD;s on how to practice pool to improve."
4,Helpful,"My stomach is upset by most foods, but when I take the fennel pills I do feel better. I gave some to my boyfriend when his stomach was upset...and he said it worked for him too."
1,Horrible,"The fennel seed might have been nice, if I'd ever received it. It took 14 days to get the wrong product, and then I was told I had to pay over the price of the product to send what they had sent me back to get the right one sent. So I just tossed the unusable pills they sent and went and bought what I wanted at a nearby store."
1,Complete waste of money,The product didn't do anything for the digestive issues I purchased it to address. It was a complete waste of money.
1,so over priced,I would really like to get this cd but the price is just to rediculace and turned me away not a way to get people to buy if it were say $20 i would so get it
2,Leaky,"I bought this based upon price, but have been disappointed with the constant leaking. I will be replacing this with another bottle, preferably one that top-fills, as well."
4,Nice survey,"What's nice about this survey (or any survey) is that you're bound to find half the essays good and half bad with one or two essays that are spot on. Personally, I think the key to enjoying this book is to skip the sections that you don't click with -- though I have to say I wanted to skip the exerpt from A Savage God and I'm glad I didn't.This book is also interesting if you're a writer since it offers so many different writing styles. Sort of reminds me of an episode of, I think, Sesame Street in which two painters rendered the same tree. Here, different writers render their own version of a similar emotion, depression. Definitely worth reading."
3,Uneven,"About: Writers who have suffered from depression as well as some of their friends and relatives write essays on their experiences.Pros: Interesting mix, I liked that other folks besides the writers chimed in to give another view of depression experiencesCons: VERY uneven. Some essays are good, others boringGrade: C"
3,not too impressed,"This collection could best be described as a mixed bag. Some essays are penetrating, insightful and well-written; others are in need of editing - they read more like a magazine piece, a draft of one that is. There are many dead-on descriptions of what it is like to exist (you don't exactly ""live"" during depression) with a mood disorder. However, the essays are long on description - however well done - and short on conclusions. Though this isn't necessarily a drawback, depression being such an intensely self-absorbed ailment to have - the writers draw no or few parallels between their mood disorders and the bigger world out there. And warning - few end on a very positive note, though again it is probably dense to expect otherwise. But this does make for a very claustrophobic reading experience. Just don't read during a deep depression, and you'll be okay."
5,A Private Grief,"For those not afflicted with this malady, it can be difficult to understand. What this book offers, better than any book I have read on the subject, is the varied experiences of those who have suffered from depression. What the reader gathers from reading the various accounts, is that this really is a personal illness, and that there isn't a ""one size fits all"" solution for coping with the ""despair beyond despair."" I think with the publication of such books, along with ""Darkness Visible,"" those who have felt marginalized by depression will at least be given a more sympathetic ear. A must read."
3,"Well, That Certainly Was Depressing","The objective of this collection by Ms. Casey is noble. The essays are a mixed bag of writing styles. As a male who suffers from depression, some of the pieces resonated for me. The companion essays which gave the suffer and their significant other's perspectives were especially helpful. A few of the womens' perspectives, however, were too wordy and nebulous for my tastes. Informative for people that suffer from depression as well as the more fortunate readers who don't have this demon on their back. Worth reading, but a tough book to plow through because of its constant drumbeat of misery. You're darn tootin' the next book I read is going to be a comedy."
2,i was depressed - and i still am...,"This book looks to give a variety of perspectives and there are a few quality writings, notably William Styron, but on the whole these authors share little new insight into the illness and the feelings around it. It is mostly badly written, self indulgent and uninspiring. It left me as depressed as i already was, if not more."
2,Not at all what I expected.....a disappointment.,"Very off topic. Viewed author's inteview on television, and it didn't match what was described. A bit ""spacey""."
4,"helpful, moving","A fine collection, thought-provoking, encouraging, often beautifully written . . . and it's important to know that depression can take many forms. I have recommended this book many times."
1,Kitchen is Better Left in the Store,"I chose this CD as it featured Manda Rin from Bis, which is one of my favorite bands. Unfortunately, if you're expecting the electronic poppy punk that is characteristic of Bis, you've come to the wrong place. This CD has only three tracks, all of which sound as though Manda is singing from the depths of a garbage disposal accompanied by a lawnmower and vacuum cleaner which are used as instruments.I couldn't distinguish any of the lyrics, which all have a distorted reverb-y quality to them. This CD frightened my cats, who looked at the stereo in horror as if it were about to morph into something monstrous and attack them. In short, I suggest heartily that Kitchen is Better Left in the Store."
5,High Quality,"The wife wanted a tracing box...this one had good reviews so I got it. It did not disappoint, nice and bright, sturdy. Very pleased."
5,This One's the Best,"If you want this size, buy this one - and from this seller. It has two color-corrected lamps. Bright enough to light up my work, and light up the rest of my office as well! I compared them all, and this seller gives you the most for your money.Be aware that there are larger sizes from Gagne (Porta-Trace), if that's what you need, and you can pay several times the price for the big ones.For home use, however, you can't beat this one."
2,Bareopera,"Although the performance of this opera is quite good, the big drawback is there are no subtitles. Had I known this before purchasing this dvd I probably wouldn't have."
1,Don't Buy This,"I bought this game for my 9 year old daughter. She has many of the other Barbie games. She loves this movie and loves to dance so I got this game for her birthday with much anticipation but when she put it on the computer she was greatly disappointed. The scenery moves with the character which caused her confusion. She became very frustrated and started crying because she couldn't do the game. I even tried to play the game for awhile and was very disappointed. Luckily I also gave her Barbie Diaries and that game was much better. Barbie 12 dancing princess would have so much fun if they would have just followed the same programming style as they did in Rapunzel, Princess and the Pauper and Swan Lake."
1,"Not Easy, But we did Finish it!","My 8 year old was able to do most of the game herself. I would not recommend this game for anyone younger, as it requires good eye-hand coordination.The program had 3 problem areas for her. First was an invisible game. The graphics just were not there. I managed to play the invisible game and get past it for her. (This is not an easy thing to do.) Second was a Twila game. Very difficult to figure out and maneuver, but I did manage to get past it for my daughter. The Third and most frustrating was a program loop at one spot. If you manage to get past the spot with no mistakes, it is not a problem, but if you make a mistake you have to quit the game and restart. It restarts fairly close to the trouble spot, but not close enough. It took us about 30 minutes to get past it, with no mistakes.I would not recommend this game because of these trouble spots. If they were to fix these areas, the game would very nice for children with good eye-hand coordination."
3,Parts are very difficult and frustrating,"Not for kids [..], except that parts are so easy that they will frustrate [...]. The ""twyla"" part is not difficult, it's just poorly programmed therefore furtsrating even for adults, as the keys don't respond quickly the way they should. Navigation in general is very frustrating, very slow, one must press dozens of keys to simply advance a bit at times due to bad directioning in the program.Imagine your [...]REALLY looking forward to the game... and then dumping it in frustration three hours later. Besides, the game contains neither the music nor the voices from the movie."
1,don't bother,"My daughter received this along with the Barbie Princess and Pauper game for her fifth birthday. The other game she is able to do all by herself and completed the game all by herself. This one I tried playing with her and we both end up angry and frustrated with it. Since I have trouble with it, I can't imagine what the programmers were thinking when they thought this would be a good game for a small child. I would give it zero stars if I could."
4,Twyla the cat and the flowers was my daughter's only complaint,"I cannot stress enough that you read Kaptain Kyle's review of this game. After we read his review it took us only 5 to 10 minutes to beat the ""Twyla catching flowers"" game. (Thank you, Kaptain Kyle!)My 7 year old daughter ripped through this game in approx. 5 hours total. Granted, she has played all of the other Barbie games so she has some prior experience with the Barbie format, so it might have been easier for her than other kids who haven't had the prior experience. The second day she had the game she played the game from beginning to end 3 times. She absolutely adores it. I suspect she'll play it quite a few more times before tiring of it.Good game with the exception of the ""Twyla/flowers"" hurdle."
1,Brought my daughter to tears on Christmas morning!,"If I could give this game a zero I would. The game starts out good with nice graphics and all, bt very quickly goes down hill. The child has to complete tasks to find the princesses. The first task is to make a little kitten jump and duck to catch flowers, but if you miss you loose all your flowers. My daughter tried for over 30 min. Then I tried for 1 hour, the my husband tried and my son (a game fanatic) tried. None of us could complete the task. I had to try and explain to my daughter why Santa would bring a ""mean game"". The purpose of the game is supposed to be fun for the child, not frustrating for the whole family. Don't buy this game and warn everyone you know not to buy it. Lets stop any more children from crying because of this awful game!"
1,"too hard for a 6 year old, disappointing!","This is the worst Barbie game we have seen. My six year old was very frustrated (and I was too after several attempts at helping her). She usually plays games similar to this on her own, but there was no part of this game she could play alone. The instructions are poor and the kitty catching the flower game is impossible and extremely frustrating! I wish I would have read the other reviews before purchasing this game. We are very disappointed and after several hours, I'm sure it will never be finished. I think my daughter has given up and is sorry that Santa would bring her such a hard game. Do not purchase this for a young Barbie fan, or you will be the one playing it and getting frustrated too!"
1,not worth the headache,"All of the reviews here are correct. We bought the game despite the reviews because my 5 year old loves all the Barbie games and can do them by herself. Well, 7 hours later, we have yet to solve the game. And that is with mom and dad trying to do it with her. You just continue to walk through the same areas over and over with no luck in finding the last princess. My daughter went to bed in tears. This was not worth the money, the time, the headache, or the tears. How can this Barbie game be so different from all the others. How can a 5 year old complete the game when a 35 year old can't?? If you are looking for a Barbie game the kids will enjoy look at the Rapuzel or Magic Pegasus. At least then the child will actually have fun."
1,Extremly poor quality,"I bought this for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas. It is extremly buggy, and hard to play. Definitly not worth the money."
1,"poor design, poor service","I bought this game for my daughters at Christmas and sent the company an email on Dec. 29. I have not received a reply a full month later. My daughters were both frustrated at the game and its ""bugs"" that Activision will not help me fix. At one point, if Genevieve fell off the crystal walkway, she would not stop falling from the sky! The only way to stop her was to back completely out of the game. I expected a patch to fix this error, but have not gotten a response. The Twyla game is a mess. After trying to help them through it, I gave up. For every flower Twyla catches, she loses it immediately. It is too frustrating for anyone at any age. I am inclined to never purchase a game from Activision again, and I hope you do not waste your money on this game."
5,Listening to Shaka Zulu for hours is a delightful experience,"The beautiful blending of the voices and sounds is a true delight to the senses. ""King of Kings"" and ""Rain, Rain, Beautiful Rain"" are two of my favorites. There is not a ""filler"" song on the CD. All the songs are excellent in their own right. Beautifully done gentlemen!"
2,Magnifier sheet is not as good as expected,"I needed a magnifier for reading sheets of very small print stock reports. I wanted something to lay over the pages and magnify the type. The UltraOptix Magnifier did not meet my needs. There is no magnification when the magnifier is layed on the printed page. The Magnifier must be held and raised an inch or two above the page to see any magnification of the print. In addition there are lines in the Magnifier which themselves blur the magnified print. Overall, the product did not meet my needs."
1,hand lens,I bought two of these lenses for my husband and he threw them away because the print was wavey. would not spend the money for them again...unusable.
4,Two hit wonder,"Not bad, but the man had only two charting hits. Mostly remembered for the Gidget movies. But the songs are neat."
4,Gin & Juice,"Great Bluegrass version of Gin and Juice by Snoop. Plus, the remaining songs are great too."
3,"Evan (Long, Tall Texan)",Didn't like this book as much as most Palmer books.It just did't have the punch.Guess I'm just use to her booking moving along faster.
3,Good,"Strictly meant maybe for young girls with older guy crushes. Didn't even finish the book, but I'm 63 yrs old. Lol"
2,Nortrac Replacement Parts hard to get,"I purchased the Nortrac 25HP aggie tractor and recently had the starter solenoid go bad. I placed an order with Northern Tool (Nortrac US Disti)and now have been waiting almost 3 months for the part while my tractor sits dead. The parts for these tractors are all made in China, and if there is a difficulty there, the US dealers cant get parts.Be very careful with this tractor mfg if you really rely on your tractors. Otherwise the tractor has been great."
4,Great for the price,"I needed extra discs to lend to friends when playing with beginners. These discs are very good, fly well and far. The plastic is much harder than the other discs in my bag, but this doesn't take away from their performance.Overall very pleased with the purchase."
2,Innova or Discraft is better,"I was rooting for the underdog in disc golf and since I grew up with Wham-O, I gave them a try. However, this set does not feel as good as the leading disc golf brands' (Innova and Discraft) novice discs. I keep these discs in case I want to introduce someone to the sport, but I no longer use them."
2,Not a good match for beginners,"If you are a beginning disc golfer, this set is not for you. The discs are too heavy! Golf discs, like any others, are weighed in grams. The Wham-O Frisbee brands are generally weigh more than 175 grams. This means they are hard to control, and for someone learning the game, they will not fly straight. Instead, they will ""fade,"" which means curve from right to left for a right handed thrower (left to right for a left handed thrower). While it is true that all discs generally fade, these could frustrate you. Instead, choose a set specifically designed for beginners from one of the major manufacturers specializing in disc golf, such as Innova or Discraft. The lighter weights, and the discs included, are designed to help a new disc golfer get better results."
4,one gallonstorage bags with twist ties,One gallon storage bags with twist ties are hard to find at any retail store as they are stocking primairly zipper lock or press to lock bags which I find clumsy and inconvenient.These bags are of a thinner guage than the competitor's brand which I cannot find anymore. They are difficult to open as the sides of the bag cling together. Other wise they fill the function they are intended for and I recommend them.Delivery was prompt.
5,Glad 1 Gallon Open Top twist tie baggie,"These remind me of Dixie 5oz Kitchen Cups, also discontinued. btw I found them her in amazon. although having to buy a case of 1200 of them, who cares for $30.00. I was just into Stater Bros. yesterday looking for these now, and there general floor manager called Glad and the Generic company, they are officially discontinued by the Mfg, what ever is left is sitting in warehouses. That is where they are finding these supplies at, squirreled away. so buy them while you can even though you may not need them now DO IT!! Jesus its only $30.00By the way here is the link to the standard 5 oz Standard Kitchen Dixie Cups: they do fit the dispenser.[...]Enjoy, as I know I willl!"
4,loved it,"I'm graduating this year and we wanted to do something special so everyone was asked to write a letter for him/herself so that we could read it at the reunion , 10 years from now, so we got this wax seal and sealed all the letters and everything looked really posh,at least that way we can make sure that they won't be opened."
2,Adorable!,"I just love Norwegian Fjords. They're my favorite pony breed so I bought this when it first came out a few years ago. My only complaint, I wish Breyer would come out with a new Norwegian Fjord. Maybe a foal or something...Oh, yeah. About the 2 stars for fun..This isn't really a fun toy. ..., these model horses are collector's items meaning don't give em to your 4-year-old to play with and bang up unless you like wasting money. However, if you have an older child who loves horses, this is definitely a great gift."
5,A chilling thriller!,"Wow -- Business To Kill For is a suspense thriller to kill for. I bought it last Satuday and just kept reading ... and reading ... before dinner-during dinner-after dinner-in bed. Two nice people, through no fault of their own, find themselves in a lot of trouble, then get caught up in a web of corporate greed from which they may not escape alive. But in the process they find themselves. This book is great fun to read, chocked full of physical and emotional suspense, from page one to the ending .. and what an incredible nail-biter ending it has! I was turning the pages so fast, it's like aerobic reading! I can't wait for Brogan's next novel."
4,A great step up to quality knives !!!,"I have cooked for years, and I always had OK knives. This set is an excellent step up.......they are razor sharp, and have the thickness that gives them good rigidity, as well as a great fit in the hand. I purchased these with the intention of eventually supplimenting the set with other Wusthof forged knives. Highly recommended !!!"
3,Don't be fooled by the endorsement.,"I was not at all impressed by these knives. They're probably better than what most non-serious cooks will have in the kitchen, but don't assume that Wusthof + Emeril = quality. These are the cheapest line Wusthof makes and I find it REALLY hard to believe they are the ones Emeril uses. He uses the real hand-forged Wusthofs, the expensive ones with a bolster and full tang that are heavy enough to do the job. These ones are cheap stamped steel. They're lightweight, thin, and have a tendency to flex. That's good for a filleting or boning knife (neither of which are included in the set) but bad for everyday chopping tasks and abysmal for heavy tasks. Don't try to tackle a whole chicken or pork roast with these things. They're pretty sharp out of the box, but flimsy and overall the quality is not what you'd expect from Wusthof. For the money you're much better off buying a smaller number of Wusthof's Grand Prix or Classic lines."
4,sharp and a delight to work with BUT>>>>>>>,"the wusthof ""sticker"" came off the knives after washing - yes of course on each knife blade it has it stamped on them ""both emeril's name and the wusthof logo"" but there is a cheapo sticker on the handle - you would think for this about of money they could use something a bit more sturdy/durable then a sticker!!"
5,Well researched Pearl Harbor book,The research for this book was excellent. I got the feeling that I got an accurate depiction of what went on in Washington as well as Hawaii. Mixing this history into a fictional story made it interesting.
5,"Intense, absorbing & hard to put down.","Steve Brown writes with the best of them. His novel, ""Of Love and War"", is one of the best I have ever read about the 40's and the entrance of the US into WWII. His research is flawless and his characters are real and believable. It is easy to get caught up in this one and hard to put down. I lived through the era and spent 26 years in the military. Looking forward to a sequel."
3,Not What It Purports To Be,"I bought this book based on the reviews on this site and what information I could glean from the sample pages. However it did not meet my needs in the following way :-There is insufficient information in the book to derive a basic trajectory table from a few given parameters which are normally available to a reloader i.e. ballistic coefficient, muzzle velocity, sight height and zero range. I have since found what I need, which is very simple set of formulae by Professor Pejsa. I am not saying this book is worthless, it has a wealth of interesting information. However it is described on the cover as ""Basic to Advanced Ballistics"" - I think the middle two words of that phrase are inappropriate.I am not sure what Mr Rinker's mathematical abilities are, but he certainly doesn't have much confidence in his readers' maths. I would have thought that most people with an interest in ballistics would have an interest in maths and physics, so am not sure who the target audience is."
1,Disappointment,"The book is simply a hodge-podge of topics, presented withoutphysical or mathematical justification, aimed at someone with about an eighth grade education, that is to say, on the level ofthe stupider grade of gun magazine. The text is garbled, with uncorrected grammatical errors, the mathematics likewise; the book does not appear to have had an editor or proofreader. There is no derivation of the equations, and although the authorsometimes mentions where he found them, no adequate referencesto the sources are made; worse still, there is no bibliography whatsoever. It's a waste of money if the reader is interestedin science or engineering; as for practical shooting, I cannotcomment. There is neither practical nor theoretical detail."
4,Rinky Dink,"If you want to understand firearm ballistics, all you need is this little gem from Robert Rinker. My interest was marginal for the better part of my life, until I went to play Laserquest with my kids, and Jemima (my 2nd oldest) whipped me. Even for laser guns (non-conventional firearms, I prefer to call them), issues such as trajectory, wind-factor and motion are germane. This book is, indeed, ballistics."
4,Good Book.,An interesting and very good book. Well done. I say again I like very much this good well done interesting book.
4,"Easier to read than most, but not for the average hobbyist","If you have average or above intelligence, you will be able to read and understand this book. If you took shop instead of algebra in high school, you may want to buy a different book. It explains how a bullet and barrel function, from internal to extrernal ballistics. You will get a lengthy explanation of the effects of greavity, angle, and wind on a bullet once it leaves the muzzle, and you will learn about why a barrel has grooves and lands and what effect the rate of twist has on a bullet. The average shooter will learn some useful stuff from this book and it is by far the easiest explanation of ballistics I have seen. Yeah, there is some math, but you can skip those parts and still gain a deeper appreciation for accurate shooting, especially for long distance hunting or target shooting. Bottom line: for me, well worth the price."
5,I would never use this product in my kitchen,"Aside from batter and breading not being something we do often (who needs the carbs, calories, and deep fry oils?) this is a useful product.I use it in my garden to sift large bits of organic matter from the dirt I dig up. I am in the process of removing my lawn and replacing it with garden, re-using as much dirt as possible. So, when I have a few moments to relax out with the kids, I just use this to sort out little bits of dirt and organic matter in small doses without gettin too much dirt on me.I'm sure it works okay in the kitchen, but I suggest this item for gardners who need to sift soil or compost. You can likely stretch a smaller-holed fabric on or under it to refine the process even further.A gardener's delight!"
3,Good but dated by todays standers,"I have always been a Driver fan, back when the first one came out. This is good but not really good enough to play through it again once you beat it. If you can find it for cheap(for $5 here, pretty cheap) and your pc is not able to handle today's top of the line games, then this is worth checking out. Other wise, try Mafia 2."
2,I don't like story based games,"This is a strange game. I guess I never tried a racing game, where the story line was the main thing and the driving was secondary. I'm too dense to have 40 different controls to run the game, that's why I stick to racing games. This one is too complicated. There's controller assignments in driving, walking, visual and menu modes. Too much for me. I spent more time on the controls than playing the game and some stuff I couldn't find the answer to, like how to answer messages. I just didn't like the game. I would rather try racing games where it's all about racing, not all about a bedtime story..It is great to run people down though, but it's too easy, no fun after a few times..."
3,Driver: Parallel Lines for PC,The main problem I have with this game is that it does not work correctly with my controller - Logitech MOMO steering wheel and pedals. It doesn't seem to recognize my joystick at all.
3,What really is in the box?,"The Wusthof Classic 10-Piece block set is supposed to come with a 9 inch sharpening steel - ours came with a 7 inch. Also, when we opened the box, there was a postcard inside which indicated that due to production delays, the 4 1/2 inch utility knife was not included. All we had to do was send in the postcard and we would be sent the 4 1/2 in utility knife; however, that was not the knife that was actually missing.The knives function extremely well - extremely sharp and well balanced; however, when we spend this much on a knife set, we didn't expect to the manufacturer package the wrong products or not know what they packaged."
5,Excellent Knives,"I bought this set (or its equivalent) about 4 years ago. They are spectacular and I have nothing negative to say about them. You would be hard pressed to find better, but if you look, remember that forged (like these) is 10x better than stamped."
1,Poor materials,I purchased this 10 knife set at the local kitchen store. I've had them for about six months and I am very disappointed. They are supposed to be dishwasher safe but three of the knife handles have cracked in the dishwasher with chunks of the handles breaking off. Two of the knives have developed rust spots. The knives are sharp and easy to sharpen but other than that I would not recommend this set.
3,Wusthof knife block set.,"We really like this knife set except for one thing. The block looks as if it was properly finished but before packaging in the original box it looks to have been damaged by a sanding machine on the front face where the name is located. It is quite severe and if we had not been visiting the States from our home on Mexico, (we are Canadians) we would definitely have sent it back for a replacement. The finish has been sanded off including part of the name maybe by accident but it should never have passed the quality control department. Since we live in Mexico it is not practical to return it as the replacement would likely never arrive. So I plan to try to refinish it myself and it won't be easy. The knives on the other hand are just great. This problem has nothing to do with the retailer/shipper, it was entirely the fault of the manufacturer, Wusthof."
3,Leave no cliche unused,"Okay, you got your basic demented, psychopathic bad guy who gets his thrills from killing cops and carving them up. Of course, you have to plow through 300 pages before you understand his motives.Add to this, you have your basic collection of TV cops: The uptight internal affairs creep, the good old boy target of the IA creep, the love affair between two unmarried cops, the cop and his son the cop, the Catholic family cops, the undercover cops, the cop gone bad etc...There is a good story trying to get out, but it is mired in a lot of predictable dialogue and uneven pacing."
5,Blindsided by Clyde Phillips,Blindsided was an extremely well written novel. This book was filled with superb detail and intense action sequences. This book is also loaded with suspense. Jane and Kenny (the two main characters) are strong and very realistic. They are strong but they have aweak side too. They're not invulnerable. Clyde Phillips throws a curve ball at the end of this one. It is a great suprise ending. So if you like mysteryies and action novels this is the book for you. Also if you like romance I suggest you read it. Overall it's a great book.
4,"Good, old fashioned country music","This CD is a great mix of kick back relaxing country tunes and upbeat, jump around and dance songs. I love a collection of music that you can turn up on the radio and sing along, and this is definately one. The more I listen to it, the more I enjoy it, and does it make you smile. It's simplicity and catchy lyrics are a big plus."
1,remote,It works win it wants to but what do u expect for a few dollars maybe batteries were dead when I got it
5,Excellent and easy,"Our 2 factory keyless remotes for our 1998 Expedition were worn out. Both had the plastic that attaches them to the keyring broken. Finally after loosing one and the other stopped working, I ordered this replacement. I was worried that, like some other cars, I would need the old remotes to program this one. Ford made it simple to program (turning ignition off and on 8 times, followed by pressing a button on any remotes to be used, up to 4). The quality of this remote is great for the price. I will be ordering a second and also another for our Grand Marquis since I only have one for it."
5,Ford remote/expedition..,"Works well, easy to program... Fast delivery item as described. I am so happy to have this remote, it was worth the price. Thank you.."
3,For fans,"Fans of Low will enjoy the drawn-out exporation and experimentation on this one. None of the songs jump out the way they should. Luckily, on ""Secret Name"" the band took these nascent experiments to sonic heights. Newcomers should save this for later and head straight for ""Secret Name""Oh yeah, if you have a chance to attend a live show, DO IT!"
5,home-recording from everyone's favorite minimalists,"After three wonderful records, Low were dropped by their label Vernon Yard. In the months following, the band set up a studio in their home and began recording some songs on their own. The result is ""Songs For A Dead Pilot"" released on Chicago's Kranky label. ""Songs..."" combines Low's familiar minimalist songwriting with some new elements provided by the home-recording experience. There's lots of tape-hiss and reverb; even the clothes-drier makes an apperance on one song (though you wouldn't know it). I've always felt that Low were an experimental band to begin with, so calling this record their ""experimental"" album doesn't really make sense. I'd rather say that Low have taken their extreme minimalism just a little further.It's quiet, stark, icy, lonely...yes. Just what I'd want from Low."
2,Low outweighs high,"2 1/2A pair of pretty songs do not save this from falling into the vacuously indulgent category- a bloated yet empty ""Born By The Wires"" shows Low at their lowest, nearly canceling out all the goodwill generated by the haunting, pre-Closer sounding ""Condescend""."
2,an unexpected low-end,"low is one of my favorite bands, however i was entirely displeased with the cd. 'the curtain hits the cast' was much better, and this album just lacked in all aspects. it was much too monotonous (even for low)"
3,It does break when dropped,The pitch said the plates would not chip or break if dropped. WRONGOther than that they work fine
2,My Bird Won't Go Near This Perch,"I mistakenly thought my cockatiel would enjoy an Insight sand perch because he loves sitting on and chewing calcium/cuttlebone perches and gritted perch covers. It's been over a month, and he still won't go near this perch. I didn't realize it is made of plastic, and that may be why he hates it. Although more expensive, I will stick to multipurpose calcium/cuttlebone perches--what our cockatiel enjoys most and what I now know is a healthier choice."
4,The light works great!!,The light is the perfect brightness to see all of the food cooking on your grill the lamp extends high enough to light the whole grill. I can't speak to how well the mosquito repellant works... but I never really expected it to work anyway. That kind of stuff never does.
1,Great if you don't want to wake up.,"When you buy an alarm clock you expect it to at least wake you up. Unfortunately, there is no volume adjustment so if it isn't loud enough, tough luck. Ok, so you get what you pay for."
2,"Big numbers, soft alarm",This alarm clock is easy to use and set up. It has a large time read out. The biggest draw back is the soft alarm. It need needs to be much louder.
2,Wrong chain!,Oregon makes an excellent chain but double-check the specifications before you purchase any chain and make sure that it is compatible with your saw! I learned the hard way and spent $137 on repairs for my Husqvarna 450 chain saw all because of the wrong type of chain.
4,Pay attention to this series,"There is no reason why this writer isn't on your list. Except for a ""too tricky"" ending that was seen from afar, this is the real thing."
4,Stays interesting,"Personally I like the detail of lifestyles and depth of characters and yet, stays easy to follow. I like law enforcement, the out doors, the adventure of the whole book. Made me look forward to getting back to the book and see what's ""around the next turn"".I'd recommend it to anyone who likes nature and mystery with history mixed in."
5,Outstanding,Joseph Heywood's books grab you right from the beginning to the end. I highly recommend all of Joe's books in this series!
4,USEFUL FOR INVESTORS AND MONEY MANAGERS,"This ""Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms"" offers accurate and concise definitions. John Downes and his colleagues did a good job in ensuring that all the important concepts and terms were tackled.This lexicon was designed to help both professionals and non-professional investors understand all the basic concepts that guide Money Management.With just over 5,000 terms, it may not be described as having extensive coverage, yet, its accuracy and portability are hard to beat. It has a good value.This is one dictionary that will meet the needs of most investors and money managers."
1,a big disappointment,"the book was very outdated, and there are so many terms jammed into this book that the book is completely curled up from me trying to look at definitions. Also, I realized that Barron's (as in the financial publisher related to Dow Jones) has nothing to do with this book."
4,"Useful, small, light....","It helped me on several occasions. There are, however, terms that are not defined, so I need to refer to the internet for those. Overall, a good deal...."
5,Excellent reference guide for the beginner!,Great tool for brief financial definitions. Recommended for those who are new to investing and need to learn financial jargon.
3,"Pretty good, but missing key investment terms","The book isn't bad. But it is missing some key investment terms, like PRICE/BOOK, PRICE/SALES. As i'm analyzing funds, and looking at different ratios, i keep picking up this book, and not finding the terms i'm looking for. But for $10.00, it does have a lot of terms,the binding is excellent, the pages are sturdy, and the book is small (5x7)."
4,Great Tool When Dealing with Finance or Investment,"Unless you work in finance and investment, it is virtually impossible to keep apprised of the terminology and jargon. Even if you do, it's probably fairly easy to come across some word that you do not know the meaning of or are uncertain as to its meaning. This handy reference book is perfect for both professionals and non-professionals who find themselves confronted with the often arcane verbiage of the finance and investment world.This book has frequently been of personal use to me in reviewing contracts for clients, as well as helping me when I stumble across some unknown term while reading. This is a nice little tool that should be on your shelf or in your pocket the next time you talk to someone about finances, investments, or even insurance."
1,I was dissatisfied--I returned my book,"I expected much more out of this book. There were many common terms that were missing, and the book is difficult to open because they try to pack so much into so few pages; as a result, you only need to open it a few times before the book is permanently bent."
5,The number one cause of your unhappiness is_________,This book is for real. It's not just another self-help psychological collection of mumbo-jumbo.It is a book worth reading. It is a book worth contemplating. It is a book that makes sense. You can't change what happens to you or the way everyone in this world treats you; but you can control how you react to it and what lies you choose to believe.
2,Very uncomfortable,"For me, these shoes were terribly uncomfortable. The back of the shoe is very stiff and a little low, so it scrapes against my heels with every step. I tried adding some heel inserts to add more padding, but they didn't really help.On the plus side, they do look pretty nice. They have the styling of shoes that would ordinarily cost much more. If you get the dark brown ones, as I did, then take note of the brown/black stripes on the heel part of the sole. I didn't notice those before I bought it, and I don't think they look that great."
3,Too Tight,"If you can get by the fact that the shoes are a tight fit - I recommend getting one size wider than normal. Unlike the traditional Sketchers, these were uncomfortable and the picture(s) do not clearly show the actual style, a style I will not purchase again."
5,so much cuiter in real life,Very sweet little kitty charm. Looks much better on my charm bracelet than it does in the picture above. Happy with my purchase!
3,"not great, just good.....","this is not my favorite Lasgo track, but the Jan Vervloet remix on this cd does bring out the best in the song, so I have no complaints there.But as far as the original version goes, I just don't see how it can compare to any of Lasgo's previous releases, such as ""Something"", ""Alone"", or ""Pray"" which were all awesome songs. I don't know what happened here, but I definitely hope the rest of the songs on their sophomore effort ""Far Away"" released later this month (1/25/2005) are better than this."
4,Euro mixes that all sound the same.,I bought this single because it went number one on the Billboard dance airplay chart. This song has 10 mixes that has just very little differences between the mixes. There is no house mix but just the same sounding trance driven beat. I am giving it the 4 stars although I shouldn't because of the lead vocals. I like the song and the vocals of Evi Goffin but there should have been about only 5 mixes on the cd. Here is the track listing:1- Radio Edit (3:08)2- Extended Mix (5:35)3- Peter Luts Remix (8:48)4- Cor Fijneman Remix (6:59)5- Jan Vervloet Remix (7:34)-- my favorite mix6- McCullen Outlaw Mix (7:16)7- McCullen Vs. Moldenhauser Remix (7:41)8- Pulsedriver's Vox Remix (6:56)9- Pulsedriver's Dub Mix (6:00)10- Ronald Van Gelderen Remix (8:30)Not bad but wished the label would have put on some different type of club mixes . That is all.
5,Fantastic,"I have listened to this one about 5 times and still haven't scratched the surface on all it has to offer. Many many great moments as you would expect from a Massacre album. I still love ""Killing Time"" but this is a great live offering and a super nice follow-up to ""Funny Valentine"" GET IT!"
1,Terrible text book,"I'm a UW computer engr student. We use this book here because Van Veen is the author (he is a professor here). The book is aweful. It's just plain bad. The material lacks clarity, the examples are either too easy, too hard, or do not provide any instruction at all. The math often has missing steps leaving the reader clueless as to how one arrives at the final result. The matlab code is worthless -- it doesn't teach anything nor explain anything. I recommend Oppenheim or Schaum's guide. I beg you not to waste your time or money on this ...text."
1,worst book ever,"""I'm not excited by this book. I think this is the worst book on the subject yet."" to paraphrase the back cover.This book lacks mathematical rigor, clarity and applications. It seems to be just a random stream of equations at times. The end-of chapter Matlab sections are completely useless because they explain nothing. In short, this book is a severely overpriced piece of garbage."
3,Interesting but Difficult,Signals and Systems covers several topics rapidly and concisely. Everything you need to know is there but you might spend some time looking for it. The writing is very fluid and engaging.
5,very good book on signals and systems,"I think, this book is a very good one. It gives wonderful and precise introduction to the subject. Many examples with solutions provided make it very useful for self study. To my opinion, this book is wonderful. I may recommend to buy it."
1,Do not buy this book unless absolutely necessary.,"This book provides little in the way of explanation of how to do any of the problems at the end of the chapters. The drill problems do nothing to help the learning of the student. If you find a better Signals and Systems book, let me know."
1,Not a good introductory text,"I've had to use this book. It was my intro book to the subject. I struggled a lot. Then I used Signals & Systems by Oppenheim. I goto say, that book was excellent. I still keep it for reference.Oppenheim's book first introduces the basic concepts of signals. Then goes on to explain convolution. This is the foundation for Fourier. Then he explains Fourier Series and Transforms in different chapters with enough example problems. I finished the whole Oppenheim book in a semester's course. I understand the subject pretty well now.If you want to understand this stuff, get the Oppenheim book."
1,What a rip off!!,"I didn't realize that the sellers hadn't mentioned the weight or size of the product until it reached me. Because most of the other sellers were selling a pound, I assumed this was about the same. IT IS ONLY 6 OUNCES!!!What a rip-off! I will never do business with the Almond Brothers again and I recommend no one else does so."
2,"Love Colleen, not so much the book though",Colleen Dewhurst was a wonderful actress but this autobiography falls short. She didn't want to write it but had already taken the money from the publisher so she got stuck doing it anyway. She didn't finish it before she died so the author (to save the book) finished it for her by interviewing her friends and associates. Not such a good read.
5,I Pledge Allegience to The Smiths,"I bought this album when I was 15 years old, having never heard any Smiths music before (only rave reviews). It changed my life forever. Out of 24 total tracks on the album, almost every single one grabs your heart and your mind and hardly gives any room for a break. The Smiths were the greatest pop music outfit ever to be exported from the UK. This compilation of singles demonstrates how brilliant they were at combining the emotional with the intellectual and the melencholy with the witty. I can't even begin to get into specific songs, because almost every one is a masterpiece in its own right. Anyone who would like to get to know the Smiths and enjoy poetic lyrics combined with beautiful, jangling guitars must get this collection. Life wouldn't be the same without it."
5,the charming man,"i'm a very seasoned classic rock and jazz listener. i just do not know how this fantastic band escaped my eye for such a long time. this is simply the apex of pop music and when you listen to them you know there's something special here - it is just magic. morrissey's vocals, poetry and idealism are so rare in the music industry where talent and originality have become a byline. he catches your imagination with his art, wit, openness and compassion. johnny marr's shimmering fret work provides the able foil to his band leader's genius. if you fall in love with this album but still don't want to buy the other individual albums, check out the other great collection - singles (with the legendary jacket cover). there're only seven overlaps between the two and you'd get another 11 extra songs there. great great great stuff!"
4,Essential,"The Smiths were known for writing great singles, many of which never appeared on their albums. This is a large part of what makes this compilation so essential. Many of The Smiths best singles can be found on this album and its English counterpart The World Won't Listen, songs like ""Ask"", ""Panic"", ""William, it Was Really Nothing"", ""Shoplifters.."", ""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"", ""Half a Person"", and ""Please Please let Me Get What I Want"" can be found here."
5,it is another great Smiths album,It is probably one of the best albums of Smiths. I have been wanting to buy this album for a long time. I finally bought it and very glad that I did...
5,Classic Dwight,"This album is a sure favorite of mine, although not as great as Guitars, Cadillacs, etc. this album is exceptional. My favorite tracks are obvious favorites like Little Ways ,Please, Please Baby , Little Sister and Readin' ..RT23. 1000 miles is the most forlorn and longing song in existence, telling a tale of a busted marriage and reflecting on the loss. This is an awesome album, worth many many listens. I highly suggest this album, it is among Dwights top 3 albums."
2,A digital Prefab Sprout,"20 years ago Prefab Sprout was crucified for producing catchy, lushly textured pop tunes (just like Stars) by many of the same mags that are saluting Nightsongs and Heart. Stars' tinny, compressed, vacuum-packed sound is flat. Bascially two dimensional. Don't be fooled by cheap imitations. If you like this type of candy, Prefab Sprout has a much more natural (and accoustic) flavor."
5,Just stunning,"I've owned this disc for about a year now & it is still one of my very favorites, and I listen to a LOT of music. The songs are beautiful and hooky and spare and catchy and lyrical and gorgeous all at once. Best comparison would be the Smiths, but without the heavy instrumentation in many Smiths songs, and more universally contemplative than Morrisey's navel-gazing. Really Stars sounds nothing like the Smiths but you can hear the influence. Bought it after hearing ""This Charming Man"" on my local indie radio station & while that's an excellent song, the rest of the album is better. Do yourself a favor and try this on for size."
4,Introduction to the Soft Revolution,Stars' Nightsongs is a healthy taste of sonic goodness. The instrumentation is fitting and the some of the grooves are truly infectious. If I had to sum up the lyrical content of this disc in one word I would use honest. They do make the attempt to softly push the pop format beyond it's radio restricted boundaries and sometimes even succeed.The female lead and backing vocals are delicious (ba bop bop baaa) and the male leads voice fits the tracks very well. If you enjoy reflecting on life while listening to music alone this disc will assist. It has a very secure spot in my listening rotation.Highly recommended for discriminating listeners that enjoy emotion generating electronica.
3,gun grips,"The grips were good, but did not fit the gun we were looking to put them on. I returned them."
4,Interesting but could be written more clearly,This book covers some very fine topics in math. It attempts to balance mathematical rigor with analogies and interesting historical points. The attempt however is not totally sucessful because the language used is too obscure. The mathematical topics discussed are complex enough by themselves and the additional obscure language makes them that much harder to understand. I would have vastly preferred the use of stright forward English for the discussion. The analogies and historical facts could have been presented separately alongside the main discussion. Nevertheless I enjoyed reading it and will recommend it to others as long as they have a good command of English and are willing to go along with the less than ideal presentation.
2,Style Over Substance,"I read a lot of poetry, so I thought this book would exhilarate me. Instead, it disappointed me. The biggest problem is that the authors dwell too long and lovingly on every single detail. To them, every insight is poetic, every thought profound. The tone is one of wide-eyed wonder, which is fine in moderation, but which, when it is unrelenting, turns into a distraction. The style gets in the way of the math, and trying to get through it is more exhausting than exciting."
3,Liquid spaces and fertile places,"I bought this on the advice of Portis,and what good advice it was.Imagine the sounds of the creation of life on Earth,now slow the sounds down until one second becomes one hour,that's something like the sounds of this disc.Imagine you are an alien visiting the earth.You travel inside a liquid bubble floating through this strange landscape,through air and water...each moment is so complicated and yet so simple.Perhaps the universe is simply a cell within another universe and so on into infinity...and perhaps this is the sound of all the cells singing."
3,title of review,"The first Stars Of The Lid track I heard was Be Little With Me, and I was really enchanted by it, but after thoroughly exploring the bands catalog I haven't found anything that compares. The majority of their stuff offers just a cold ambient drone without any of the My Bloody Valentiney shimmer that makes Be Little With Me so great. So if you're like me, you'd probably be better served by picking up Accelera Deck's album Narcotic Beats."
4,Funny book!,"Wodehouse is always funny. If you want to laugh when you read, try Wodehouse. I have read nearly all of his books and usually enjoy every one."
5,A delight,"There's little I can say about this book other than if you love lighthearted comedy and 'comedy of errors', read this book. There's not a single book by Wodehouse that I haven't enjoyed to some extent, but the Psmith books are among my top favorites. Psmith's urbane charm and sly wit, combined with the typical miscommunication of a Wodehouse novel are perfect."
3,Psorry About Psmith,"An early effort, which only makes you appreciate the author that Wodehouse would become, Psmith can't hold a candle to any of the Jeeves or Blandings stories."
4,Not so great - for a Star Trek fan,"Star Trek books tend to be rather poorly written. (Of course, the magnificent TV series has set the standard very high.) Considering that, Della Van Hise's book isn't actually the worst. If you're a Star Trek fan, it's absolutely worth reading. Just don't expect the kind of enjoyment you're getting from the TV series.The book deals with a kind of reality distortion. You may find it interesting to see some familiar Star Trek characters in somewhat unusual situations. I don't want to tell you any more right know, just read and see for yourself.If you're not a fan of Star Trek, my guess is that this book offers you nothing. A person not familiar with Star Trek background would probably find it just boring."
3,Another 2 mile radio,Forget about the 18 mile range. These radios will give you 2 miles max - if that! Otherwise they are pretty good. Good voice quality and nice feel to them. The belt clips are really weak though. One of mine has already broken. Not really able to use the belt clips as they are too stiff. There is also a slight delay in voice reception so you should remember to wait 2 seconds after pressing the transmit and then talk. Nice charger and quite a few useful functions like the vibrate and weather radio stations.
2,not what i expected,"i did pay attention to the mile range at least openly i tried it with my wife but it only go as far as 1 mile on open terrain surrounded by trees.. i bought this to save me a cellphone bill since she goes to school at night and is no more than 2 miles....only static.. i get more worried that she might be calling me and i dont get the signal. hhhmmm yeah works great in the mall or department store ause is under 300ft duhhh although it cost me cheap i guess i should've been inform about the actual maximum range ..... but thats what i get !!!!these radios com in handy for mall, theme parks group car travel... but not for needed distance... or else the cellphone companies will loose alot of money jejeje !"
1,A heads up for ALL,"Trust me, I just bought two sets, opened one and immediately returned the other. If you're lucky (and I do mean lucky) you might (just might) get about a 2 mile range providing there are very few trees, only one story homes, and hills no larger than can be traversed in under two minutes.In my opinion, this rule of thumb would probably go for ANY brand walkie-talkie selling for less than a hundred bucks apiece that doesn't require an FCC license to operate.I guess EXPERIENCE, along with lost money, IS the best teacher."
3,Good content but way too short,"This series of 1-2-3 videos is done well, good for beginners and laid out in a very clear matter. The issue is that they are way too short. 20 or so clips, most are around 1 minute with 20 seconds of that being a repeat of what was covered the first 40 seconds."
5,There is a Reward for You,"I once read that Joe Higgs somehow embodies the strongest characteristics of all three of the Wailers: Tosh's militancy, Bunny's spirituality, and Marley's warm musical sensibilities. Whether you agree with this or not, there is no denying the influence Higgs had on the three Wailers. His warm soulful voice is a reggae treasure, his lyricism is simple yet profound, and the backing instrumentation on this album is beautiful. It is unfortunate that this album didn't get released earlier in the seventies, because it was definitely ahead of its time.I highly recommend this album for any reggae enthusiast - it is integral to any good roots collection. I cannot imagine giving this album anything less than five stars. It is, quite simply, a musical treasure."
2,Decorating cakes and cookies,"I was frankly disappointed in this book. The decorated items were amateurish and rather sloppy in appearance. I purchased it because of the other reviews, but if I had looked at it beforehand, I would have passed on it. I haven't tried any of the recipes, so I can't comment on those."
1,Wrong description.,"The product description says that it has both Celsius and Fahrenheit scales, but it only has Fahrenheit. Furthermore, this product is not well-built. The top of the glass tube is totally tilted. The quality is so bad that I would suggest everyone who likes Galileo thermometer should look for a Germany-made one."
2,Inaccurate and misleading,"The introductory section is interesting, but once he gets into the description of the effect of killing and statements about PTSD, it went rapidly downhill. He makes statements about the causes and incidence of the disorder that are totally incorrect. He tosses around the term ""insanity"" in a manner that I would not expect from someone who is trained in psychology. I eventually stopped reading the book, because I decided that anyone who was as misguided and misguiding as he was had nothing of value to say to me."
3,"Interesting info, presented very academically","I've wanted to read this book for some time and finally took it on. Content-wise it's a roller-coaster of interesting personal anecdotes from subjects then seemingly academic research or quotations from studies. The book seems like it would be a nice companion to a college-level psychology course, but as readable non-fiction it takes a committed reader.I give the author respect for tackling this topic and for being a man of service to our country. The book could easily be abridged for the average reader simply interested in finding out more about the current state of violence in society and in modern warfare."
3,Good compilation of facts about the psychology of killing,"LTC Grossman's book is a great overview of the psychology of killing, in particular relating to soldiers during combat. What it is not is new research. If you want to read one book on the psychology of killing-read this one. If you want to really delve into the psychology of killing-read the books in the bibliography at the end of this book."
5,A book everyone should read,"This book is excellent on explaining the human mind on war and killing. Lt.Col.Dave Grossman is an awesome speaker and, he gives accurate discription of the human psychological aspect of killing. Through documented and pesonal interviews he explains that man is not born with the desire or will to kill another human, But it is formed via some degree of stimulation."
3,Interesting topic...,"There are much more comprehensive reviews than mine. Basically, an interesting topic with theories and ideas presented as psychologically accepted facts...a great leap of faith is needed to accept/believe a lot of what's presented here. Some ideas seem far-fetched and questionable with the same sources sited multiple times. Many anecdotal examples are provided. The book is repetative. Used several times, I don't think S.L.A Marshall's work is a credible source anymore. Some parts ring-true and are persuasive but I can't fully recommend this book...but if you get it use as something thought provoking rather than authoritative. Just blow past the last 1/4th of the book. This book has a definate ""point of view."" P.S. Although post Vietnam (1980's), the army's boot camp, attitude, and subsequent combat training methods didn't ""condition"" me or anyone I knew to do anything except pray to get the hell out of that game-playing foolishness as quickly as possible...."
5,"Excellent, MUST READ book","Out of all the training manuals and books that we have to read as Marines, this book has more facts and ""what to expect"" in a combat environment than any of them I have read. Just this past Feb/March, I returned home from Fallujah, Iraq where I was with RCT-1. We killed 2500 terrorists and lost 115 Marines in the 7 months I was there. Knowing everything I learned from that experience, I could not give even half the information he has provided in this book. I have read all of Mr. Grossman's book and watched all of his tapes, I CANNOT say enough great things about them. They are packed with information and knowledge that ALL law enforcement, military, security personnel, and parents should read!!! Great Book!!!!!"
2,Simplistic distortion of psychological theories.,"As a professor of Psychology (and not a stooge of the video games industry) I was quite disappointed with this book. Although it is probable that as a professor himself Grossman understands the basic theories of Pavlovian conditioning and operant conditioning, his attempts to apply these theories tortured the basic concepts into an almost unrecognizable form. Although I believe that it is truly important to discover the mechanism that allows some humans to kill others (and why so many can't or won't even try) this book is not going to shed any significant scholarly light on the subject."
4,Good,"I like this book, but I'm also a sucker for human nature & psychology. This is not an easy read. Great if you're interested in psych, PTSD, & war."
4,On Killing,"This book is a fascinating examination of why people kill, and the challenges faced by military leaders in overcoming the natural tendency to not kill. I attended one of Lt. Col Grossman's seminars a few years ago, and it made me think about personal protection in a new light."
5,Insightful,"As a child I was told never to ask an Uncle who had fought at Cassino in Italy about the war.This outstanding book goes some way to explaining that rationale.It gives insight into the extraordinary guilt and sadness that nearly everyone - even the most hardened professional soldiers - feel immediately after killing another human being. It also reveals the little publicised phenomena of the majority of troops `aiming high' to avoid killing in conflicts prior to Vietnam.A learned, candid and compassionate read - I highly recommend it."
5,'On Killing' opened my eyes,"'On Killing' is a compelling study of soldiers' performance under fire, the training developed to improve it, the personal costs soldiers pay for that improvement, and how the same methods used to desensitize soldiers to killing are being used in violent video games to ruin our children. If you thought Post Traumatic Stress Disorder was overblown, you have to read this."
5,On school yard shootings in America,"Every time there is a new school yard shooting in this country (like today), I recall the final, ominous chapter in Dave Grossman's book.What else is there to be said?"
2,This guy is a closet gun-grabber,"I thought the subject itself was interesting,(the psychology of killing and the technology used in warfare throughout history) but then it got sort of repetitive re-hashing some of the same themes and siting the same sources over and over again. Most of the book was about killing in the context of warfare and only briefly discussed the use of arms by civilians, both civilian police and normal citizens. He seemed to think that the type of training police and military get makes killing a reflex is a good thing. Whereas for civilians, guns are bad, they are getting all their training from video games and will kill without authority. In other words, he thinks civilians are not responsible enough to have guns. Too bad I had to read most of the book to get to this part. I think Grossman could have spent at least a chapter or two on civilian use of firearms for self defense, but he barely touched on it. Disappointing."
5,on combat,I liked the book. I aspired to be come a marine back in the early 80's after finishing college. I talked with some former viet-nam vets who convinced me that graduate school was a better option. I followed their advice based on the stories they told me...this book is a very good testimony of some of their experiences. now at 49 I wish I had become a marine anyway when I had the chance. I personally was'nt aware of the fact that many soldiers on both sides never used their weapons and I side with the author's view point on peace before war but we must always be prepared to defend the constitution of the United States if necessary. never the less the book is a very good study of the human psyche and of the limits of human endurance....
5,Superior,"A fascinating study into the psycology of humanity dealing with conflict and death. My interpretation of Dr. Grossman's writings is that as a species, we do not inherently want to kill and that our environmental conditioning has much to do with violence in society. If we can only get violence off T.V. and off video games we may survive. I recommend it highly."
4,Good but the second book is much better,"This is a very good book but pales in comparison to Col. Grossman's second book on combat. This book has a lot of data a is a little dry reading. However, the data is excellent and this book contains great information."
4,Helps Gain Better Understanding of the Physiology of War on Loved Ones,"This book was a recommended read by a family member to help understand the impact of war on the brave men and women that serve our country. I really enjoyed reading it and could not help to think of my Grandfather during many of the chronicles. If you want to understand your loved one better after returning from war or simply want to better understand leadership in the battlefield, read this book. I am thankful I did."
5,very informative,"I liked this book and felt it was pretty close to exhaustive of the subject ""on killing"". I learned from this and agreed with most of it."
3,"Interesting, but somewhat repetitive","Very informative but I feel that the author was repetitive in some topics. Overall a good and informative book. Chapter 7 Killing and Sexual Range: The Primal Aggression and Release, and Orgasmic Discharge was a surprise to me and is in my opinion pure 100% Bull...."
5,Stunning and In Depth! Remarkable!,I have only read half of this book and it is excellent. A must read for anyone in the military or law enforcement fields.
1,Despicable,Grossman is not a combat veteran yet he minimizes PTSD which is a great disservice to people with one or many combat tours. He has also cashed in on the fear industry after 911 in a particularly disgusting way. He may fool the uninitiated and hey cops seem to like him. Maybe they should be cops instead of trying to be paramilitary.
2,Good try on important topic but his conclusions are off,"Well written book, unfortunately based on poor data and not consistent with may facts for rates of people firing in combat. Additionally, psychopathology (PTSD) dose not necessarily result from killing the enemy if you are not a psychopath. Again not consistent with the facts. He does try to address this failure in his next book. He does do a good job on the proximity and ease of killing part of his book. I'm glad that he has approached this important subject but am concerned that readers will not be as critical as they need to be and accept his conclusions, many of which are wrong."
3,On Killing Review,Has some good points to think about when in theatre but can be edited to only a couple dozen pages.
1,"A HACK , RACIST, AND LOSER","HOW MANY BOOKS IS THIS GUY GOING TO WRITE ABOUT SAME SUBJECT? I guess it's not plagerism if you site your sources. This guy has a Ranger tab, he is not a RANGER. I saw, heard, and met this guy (at the time a Major) as a young ROTC Cadet at Fort Lewis, WA, Advance Camp 1995...he was talking about the same crap then stabing his bayonet into the ground like he new how to use the thing trying to impress a bunch of green ROTC Cadets. This guy is what is wrong with the US Army...He is a RACIST. Just because he can't explain why East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Koreans...etc)don't fit into his so called profile, he dismisses the cultures as ""robotons or bunch or robots"". what kind of flawed thinking and explanation is this? I can't believe this guys served in the US Army for so long and corrupted so many young officers minds with this trash...raising another generation of RACIST and proliferating this ideology. Save your self some money and time READ KEGAN AND MARSHALLS WORK."
3,Fascinating and insightful - but repetitive and overly long,"Really interesting material but incredibly repetitive. Would benefit greatly from a good editor to help the author organize, prioritize and cut the book's length in half. Also, with so much recent combat experience, the book relies too heavily on WWII and Vietnam era interviews and data. An update that tests the author's theories against modern experience would be really interesting. There is a great excerpt on the author's webiste which is about all you need to understand his premise."
5,On Killing,"Quite a good read on a strange subject. Grossman is good in explaining all of the Statistical references in a user friendly method.I would say this is a must for anyone currently in our Armed Forces. This book & author makes good sense in his writing. He makes an solid thesis on Killing we do, and how the shooter is likely very ill after the shot(s) drop another human."
1,claptrap!!,"Col. Grossman is full of crap.His book is full of crap,and I'm sorry I wasted my time reading it.He's an expert on killing,yet he's never seen the elaphant.That ALONE makes his books trash. This review done by 19D 1989-1997,Desert Shield,Desert Storm,Retore Hope(somolia)."
5,fire to flight ratio,You will either kill them or become a video on arabic television! Hows that for modern desensitization?
4,A Soldier's evaluation,"I found this to be a useful book and the only one I have come across that captures the ""Ranger experience"" properly. My background is similar to his but I believe he may be overestimating the hunman response to killing. In any event,it is a valuable contribution that everyone interested in Military Science should read and discuss."
1,Pseudoscience,"The author's main problem isn't that he bases his entire theory on SLA Martials combat firing ratios, a bit of Pseudoresearch that has been Thoroughly debunked. It is that he makes the logical jump from that bogus research that the reason for it is that man has some inherent quality that makes him reticent to kill other men. A cursory reading of history will show that this is not the case. Massacres are as common in history as they could be. It is a much more logical position that xenophobia is a natural human survival mechanism and that by seeing our enemies as ""The other"" we not only insure the survival of our genes but inoculate ourselves from the horror of war.I would suggest to any potential reader of Grossman's books that they look at some of the research that has proven his theories on violence and video games to be wrong before they take anything he writes seriously. He is one of the kings of pseudoscience and his work has not done the world of combat training any favors."
4,Very illuminating,"Due to the subject matter, I found myself wrapped up in this book almost right away. It's a great find considering the topic so intertwined with popular assumptions, cultural sensitivies, and politics. Grossman delves into the horrors of mass violence and the inherent ugliness of killing, but manages to maintain a respectful, understanding attitude towards its victims, combatants and non-combatants alike.I found the structure to be somewhat repetitive at times, but this also helped reinforce his main points. I would have liked longer anecdotes from soldiers and other participants, but the anecdotes he offers (short as they may be) still illustrate his point.Please read this book."
4,"50,000 to 1","A good read, very interesting. Did you know , according to the author, that the ratio of bullets fired to an enemy hit...was 50,000 to 1 ? Now with our snipers the ratio was 8 or 9.4 to 1.Thank God for the snipers.Tom Peters"
3,Lush and inspired tunes,"This is a very personal remark: the linear note at the back cover was the concept I needed to constantly return to this album, because at the last half, my attention weakens. But still very wonderful, if you grab those headphones, and just listen-listen."
1,dont buy this,"the information that i found just based on flipping thru a few pages online was very incorrect. for example, the male to female ratio is reversed, the school's website is incorrect, it says that there are 4 undergrad schools but there are only two because the other two are graduate schools, and this is a key aspect of the university. the acceptance rate is also very wrong because this year it hovered around only 18%. the percentage of students in specific majors is also not correct. i was hoping to buy this to learn more about Duke for next year, but i will no longer do so because so much of it is not correct and i am afraid to trust this book."
4,Pretty neat.,"This is a great release from Matt Mays as none of the songs sound the same, and the creativity is especially prevalent. Although all the songs are very different, they also have a way of flowing into one another while listening to the album. Definitely check it out if you're already a Matt Mays and El Torpedo fan as well as Joel Plaskett/Emergency and Matthew Good/Band.Favourite songs on this album are: ""Spoonful of Sugar,"" ""Rough N' Tumble Come Down,"" and ""Mornin' Sun.""Great Canadian rock."
1,WORKED FOR ONLY 5 MONTHS,I purchased this product 5 months ago. I was a little apprehensive at first because of the cheap plastic construction but it heated well so I unfortunately did not return the heater. On a recent chilly morning I turned on the heater to find the fan no longer runs. The 30 day return period has expired. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It is very expensive for the poor quality.
1,broke after a few months,"The product worked great out of the box. It was simple to use and effective. But after around 3 months of light use, the unit stopped working. The fan is not blowing and it is not heating the room. So now, I have to contact Vornado, ship the unit to them (at my own cost) and hope that it comes back functional. This is a real hassle and tremendously inconvenient."
4,good portable space heater for my dorm was perfect,good portable space heater for my dorm was perfect. quick shipment was appreciated as well - would recommended in future
3,An okay heater,"The heaters best feature is that it is relatively quiet. It will heat a smaller room, but anything larger than about 10'x12'or with a higher than 8' ceiling it is not up to the task. Great in a bathroom or small bedroom. Not as satisfying for a living room."
4,Best Little Heater,"These vornado heaters are the best! They do an excellent job of heating up a room, circulating the air so the floor is not cooler and they are quiet to boot! :)"
2,Heater blows cold air,"According to the instructions, when set on ""automatic,"" the fan is supposed to get lower when the heat output drops.But my experience is that when the heat output drops, the fan speed stays the same and the voronado blows COLD air, which is very unpleasant."
3,Loved this for 3 weeks until it broke. Testing warranty service...,"This was such a great heater...I used it regularly for weeks since my gas heater in my apartment busted in the middle of winter.Purchased new 12/19. On 1/8 I notice it doesn't seem as warm...1/9 it starts shutting on and off, even when not in auto mode and set on the highest heat setting. Now it runs for 2 seconds, shuts off for 10 seconds, runs for a second, etc. etc. I've just contacted Vornado customer service for a repair/replacement, since it has a 1 year warranty. Will update on quality and speed of service.I had read mixed reviews here before purchasing and hoped I wouldn't get a lemon. I would still recommend this product as long as it is being used as a supplemental heat source on lower settings, and not as your main heat source.UPDATE: 3 stars for excellent customer service."
1,This heater is terrible compared to 2 Vornados I bought 5 yrs ago,"The written description of this heater led me to believe that it would perform like the 2 5-yr-old Vornado models that are the best electric heaters I've ever had. The VH2 has major flaws. It's single fan speed is way too fast, causing heated air to be cool/cold within 10 ft of the heater. The fan cannot be slowed down. The thermostat causes the fan to stop and start in ridiculously short intervals; thereby wasting energy I believe. Finally, the thermostat is set so that when at the highest (hottest) setting it doesn't allow the heater to bring even the immediate area around it to more than 70 degrees F.I've had the heater <1 mo and will attempt to return it for a full refund in another wk or 2 as soon as I have an alternative brand in my home."
1,"""OVER"" HEATER","The VH2 I purchased almost burned down my house. The fan quit working but the heating element did not. After smelling something burning, I found the smoking heater, the heating element was red hot. The saftey devices failed to shut it down. Warrenty does not cover shipping, which is about $40.00. For that much money, I will buy a name brand heater that I can trust and who's maker stands behing the product. Vornado does not."
1,Vornado VH2 Vortex Heater,"This product can hardly be called a heater. It was nothing as described in the ads. I contacted the manufacturer and they reported it should blow 120 degrees on high. I did not measure it in the winter when the room was 66 degrees, but when I measured the temp after contacting the manufacturer, it blew 91 and 92 degrees in a 75 degree room (I measured it with laser thermostat). Basically, I bought a lemon and the manufacturer did not stand behind the product. I would recommend that if a space heater is needed, skip this one."
3,Warm and silent but faulty thermostat,"The heater gets full points for warm and silent operation but the thermostat is faulty. I don't know if the problem is specific to my unit but sometimes it toggles on/off for short periods. It runs for 15-30 secs and then shuts off. This happens intermittently and seems to be caused by a bad thermostat. Also, when the heater turns on, it draws considerable power which dims lights somewhat and trips my cable modem. But for these problems, I would have kept this heater."
2,Does Not Even Blow Hot Air,"Hot hair lacks after a while, and this piece of equipment will only blow air which makes it a fan...WHICH MAKES ME COLDER.I actually have to put a sweater when i run the vornado for the periods of blowing without hot hair it has....You pay almost 100.00 for a heater and it blows AIR.Think about it, and don't purchase this item. There are better for cheaper."
2,Cheap.,"Features are nice, however, it last that long. The unit broke after just one season of use. Would not buy again."
3,Worked great until it died after 2 years,"Great heater, the thermostat seemed to work well.It won't turn on after 2 years of light use. I only used it a couple months each Winter.Probably won't buy another."
3,Lemon or Bad Workmanship,"This worked great the first three days I had it, then it just quit blowing hot air. When I put it on auto it did try to heat but would recycle over and over only staying on for maybe 5 seconds at a time. The warranty sucks as Vornado requires you to send them a check for $20.00 for shipping return after you have had to pay to ship it to them. It is very quiet but that doesn't help if it doesn't work as nothing more than a fan."
1,Potential fire hazard!!,"After 6 months use the fan motor seized. I took off the front grill and lubed the shaft with light silicone oil. The fan motor worked for a few days, then the motor quit again. The heating element works fine, but with no airflow over the element, I think the element would ignite the motor/case. This was not a very good heater when it worked. It would heat a whole room, if the room is very small. IMO JUNK."
1,Did not last one season!,"This heater worked wonderfully . . . for less than 3 months. Too bad, after 90 days, I cannot return it, huh!"
1,Heater is a piece of crap,"Well, I researched and re-researched space heaters before settling on this one, despite a few bad reviews. I used it (not constantly, just for a half hour in the morning and a couple of hours at night) for three months or so, and it worked OK, even though the heat was not as much as I had hoped for. Then, one day I flipped the switch, the light on the button went on, and ...nothing. The fan had just stopped working. The unit wasn't dropped or misused in any way, it just.... stopped.So, in summation, this heater is a piece of crap, please don't waste your money."
1,Fan Broke After Less than Four Months,"Vornado heaters are a great idea, very poorly implemented. I would pay more for better quality, but I can't recommend this particular heater to anyone."
4,Great little heater!,"This is a great heater that really keeps temperature. We had an older heater that was hot when on and cold when off, this heater (once you get the comfort temps set) is great. It is a bit tricky to get the temps set, but after....the room temp remains constant! Great buy!"
2,"Nice, but no cigar","I've had five of these things over the last 7 years. They have all broken down in one fashion or another. I love the functionality, and really want to but another, but I just can't bring myself to spend 120 bucks every year for the same faulty device."
1,Really disappointed,"We thought we had the perfect answer for heating our 6 x 14 camping trailer wired for 120V hookup. Great features; compact, light, thermostat, anti-freeze feature, very quiet,circulating fan and fan only for those warm days. Just perfect. Problem is, it just doesn't work.Only thing that works is the on/off button that lights up but no air, no heat, no nothing. And if it is as fragile as other reviewers attest, we sure wouldn't want to depend on it on a frosty night. Company may be in trouble. We called the warranty number(got the automated weekend message on a Monday afternoon) and the customer service number on the box (got another operator message to call a 10-10 number which would cost $3.00). Good luck. Back to the drawing board."
1,"More expensive, less effective","Barely any heat comes out of this. When the room is cool, this unit works well. When the room is cold, it cannot heat things up to a comfortable level. I bought another unit (different brand) for the room. Looking to return this one."
5,Worth the price,A little pricey but very quiet and moves a lot of air. I have yet to see how it will hold up
1,don't buy this one,This heater lasted only 1 year and then died. It also had a burnt electrical smell in it's final stages which can't be good.
5,Vornado Power,"This little thing kept me and my 2 month old baby warm thru the winter. I was very hesitant to buy it, am glad I did.It's very powerful. What i like most about it ,it's silence."
3,"It Works, But Be Patient","It's very important not to get confused (as I suspect some reviewers have been) between two very similar Vortex models, the VH2 and the DVH. The DVH does indeed break almost instantly and should be avoided. This model, the VH2, on the other hand, is perfectly adequate for the price. No small electric heater in this price range is going to do a great job of quickly heating a large drafty room on an extremely cold day, but the VH2 does a find job. You will have to be patient however: it will take several hours to notice much of an effect in large dining room or kitchen. But if you wait, you will find that the VH2 gets the job done (and is quiet as well)."
5,best space heater,This is the best space heater you can get. It keeps our room warm and comfy. Since the control is analog it doesn't reset on power failure.
3,Not a Blow Hard,"Picked this up at Bed bath and Beyond online. Had the 20% off deal plus free shipping. I live in a little drafty house. Didnt expect this to heat the whole house, but wanted it for my living room where I spend a lot of time. I expected a Vornado to really move alot of air. I had their fans before and they blew really hard. This heater has the same design as the fans but blows about 1/10 the air volume. In addition the air is luke warm. I had hoped this would be a good fan for summer months, but its not powerful enough for that, and barely does its job of heating. I guess I expected a blow hard when I got it. Its ok but dont be fooled by vornados reputation of moving a lot of air."
3,Okay while it lasted,"My husband and I bought this around February 2009. We found that it did a great job at keeping a small room toasty. In our living room, there was no difference in the temperature with it on, and the same goes for our kitchen. In January 2010, the heater's power button became stuck in the off position. I sent out an initial email to [...] and then waited a week for a response. I sent out another one and still no response. I just chatted on the live chat option and someone began talking to me right away. I'm still covered under their one year warranty, so we'll see how/if they can fix it!"
1,Very Noisy,"I was hoping this model would be on the recall list because it broke right away. It is very noisy but the heat still works. I know how silent these heaters are as I know people that have them. I just purchased the new AVH2 model because we really need it for our pop-up camper. So far I love it, it is very quiet and puts out a continuous heat instead of turning on and off.I hope the company recalls the VH2 because it is too expensive for it to break so quickly."
2,Didn't last,Bought this heater brand new. Used it for two and a half months to supplement the central air and help keep our bill down. Tonight it crapped out. I agree with others a heater should last longer. Mine came with a five year warranty however ill have to look into this because I've heard mixed results.
2,Well... this one didn't last a month,"I've used Vornado heaters for years, with relatively little trouble. I needed another after a recent move to the Sierra mts. This moded worked fine for a little less than a month, then simply stopped. I returned it. If you're a Vornado user you know the Co. doesn't replace a heater, it rebuilds them. After 2 weeks I'm still waiting for mine to be returned."
1,Doesn't get hot enough to heat area.,Doesn't get hot enough to heat area. Needs to be fairly close to you to feel any warmth at all. Found it useless.
2,Nice while it lasted...,"Bought two of these in 2010. They do heat a room nicely. I don't use them much (I live in San Francisco), but one developed fan problems after a year and would only work intermittently. It finally gave up the ghost completely in November 2012. Cheaply made plastic parts probably couldn't handle the heat. I'm waiting for the second one to conk out, then I'll try a different brand."
2,Got on groupon: except a problem,"It heats up smaller rooms. I would say perfect for an apartment. However, using it plus my tv, and vacuum in my living room it short circuited my house and turned off all electricity. I wouldn't let it run for long periods of time. Yes, it gives off heat, but used better products out there. Be careful."
1,Watch your outlets...,"I received this as a christmas present and I was soooooo happy. I loved it the second I plugged it in.Over the course of a couple weeks, it completely replaced our other space heaters (way too expensive to use the baseboards).One morning I reached down to unplug it and moved it and jerked my hand back super fast from the painfully HOT plug. Pulled it out by tugging off the cord, the plug on the heater was melted and my wall socket was blackened and melted.My friend returned it and got another in exchange, as we assumed maybe it had been plugged in loosely or something to cause an issue.The new one melted a heavy duty extension cable (the kind you use when you need something you can slam a door on or take outside big fat orange thing with huge plugs) plug end, and another grounded plug and outlet.Two heaters, Two outlets, one extension cable, and grounded plug down. This thing is a menace. I'm back to my old space heaters for the sake of not waking up to fire alarms on night."
1,never again,"This is a terrible heater. It lasted one season. It's noisy and ineffective, and made with flimsy components. I've had two other Vornado heaters crap out on me. I'm finished with Vornado forever."
1,"Stopped working after 3 months,","I purchased this product from a Target store less than 3 months ago and the fan motor just went out on it. This is the 3rd Vornado product I have owned in the past year or two that had a faulty fan motor. BAD QUALITY!!!! Don,t waist your money. You might as well stick with the much cheaper models that seem to last about the same amount of time as this ""premium"" model. :-)"
5,LOVE this heater!,"We've gone through a couple heaters for my daughter's room and I should have just bought this one to start with. It is high quality, stable, quiet, and it just works well. The others are junk compared to this."
5,Fan heater is quiet and still produces lots of airflow,"i have bought three of these and use them as substitute for the radiators in the bedrooms at night. I live in the NE and our house has a single pipe steam heat system that clangs and bangs and made it impossible to enjoy a good night's sleep during the winter. we bought the fan heaters since they were advertised as quiet, as not getting too hot and as moving lots of CFM. After a month of regular use the fans have proven themselves quiet and effective. They don't get hot to the touch and i feel comfortable running them at night while we sleep. So in sum, small delta T but big m-dot leads to enough Q-dot to comfortably heat large 25x12x8 bedrooms. We run the heaters in the bedrooms and sleep in comfort while the rest of the house dips into the low 60s or upper 50s."
1,Vornado is not much help,This was a complete waste of money. Couldn't even keep my tiny bathroom warm. Diffinitely no way it will warm a whole room unless the room is two by four.
1,Flimsy Control Buttons,The control buttons on this unit collapsed into the main housing of the heater during first month of use. I had to ship the heater back to the factory for repair/replacement.
3,Best NOT TO BUY on LINe,"item heated very well not a problem very efficient unit, however it stopped working after 2-1/2 months PAST AMAZONS RETURN POLICY AND RIGHT BEFOR A HOLIDAY WEEKEND, SO I FROZE FOR 5 DAYS AND MORE..ONLY MANUFACTURE CAN HANDLE REPLACEMENT AND THEY WERE CLOSED. AMAZON HAS NO SOLUTIONS OTHER THAN SUGGESTING TO CALL THE MANUFACTURERBETTER TO BUY SOMETHING LIKE THIS FROM A LOCAL RETAILER AND NOT AMAZON WHO HAS NO, NONE, NADA ...REMEDY TO HELP GET A REPLACEMENT LOCALLY, SUCH AS A COUPON VOUCHER OR SOMETHING ELSE WHICH COULD HAVE GIVEN ME 'HEAT' FOR A VERY COLD 5 DAYS. AND POSSIBLE MORE NOW THAT I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE MANUFACTURER TO RESPOND WITH SOMETHING....NOT A GOOD INTERNET ITEM IF YOU NEED TO REPLACE A BROKEN UNIT."
4,Warm at last,"This heater is great. I bought it for my childcare, so it had to be very safe. It stays cool on the outside, it's very quiet, it warms the area without overheating the area. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the controls are accessible to little fingers. A latching cover would solve this problem. If there are no small children to consider this is a 5 star heater."
1,Horrible - and downright dangerous,"We bought this (twice, actually) for our baby's room. The first Vornado room heater we bought stopped working after less than a week. It would click on and off constantly, each day making more and more noise until it finally stopped giving off heat altogether. We thought it was just a defective unit and wanted to give it another try since we liked the idea of a non-kerosene heater. Within a few days of operating the second one, we again experienced the same jarring noises. One night I went into my daughter's room and almost passed out. Without adjusting the controls, suddenly the heating element went haywire and jacked up the temperature in her room to over 90 degrees. She had already been bundled up in fleece sleeper with a blanket over her. It's a miracle she didn't die of heatstroke. The unit went back the next day and we bought a kerosene heater that has been working well and consistently for almost 3 years now."
2,Doesn't do the job as well as the heat lamp purchased at Costco.,Doesn't do the job as well as the heat lamp purchased at Costco. Doesn't heat the room the way that it claims
1,Does NOT last.,"We purchased two different vornado heaters, approximately 2 months apart (both in the $75-90 range), because they worked well and were safe around the kids. Both died in almost exactly ONE YEAR of being purchased, and i kept them absolutely clean at all times. Would never buy another product from this company if they were $10 each. We ended up with two large pieces of garbage to dispose of. I will stick with heaters that I know last."
1,Heater? Gentle Warmer Maybe....,"I have been using the same space heater for years to take the chill out of rooms which have poor heat supply during the winter. The old unit I've used wasn't great but it did the job, (till last week when it failed). I bought this ""fan"", the Vornado yesterday and gave it a test. It doesn't get hot, seriously. It gently warms the air at best, but not enough to consider it a heater. You can honestly hold your face right up to the unit and never feel more than warm breeze on your cheeks. And as for the fan, it's not even good at that. I am still looking for a quality unit but this is not it. I hate returning things, but this units going back. Save yourself the hassle..."
5,Awesome,Great product. Does not over heat. Relatively quiet and does the job it was purchased for. Heats my son's room comfortably and goes off when the room is warm. Safe. Turns off if tipped over. Love it.
5,great space heater,"This is a great little space heater. It heats up the rooms quite well, is quiet and the actual heater doesn't get warm. I have also used it just as a fan. I would buy again."
3,on/off switch failed eventually,"This heater does exactly what is supposed to do. But eventually the on/off switch failed. Cheap components would be my guess.I had it repaired locally with a new higher quality switch and it is working again. For the price of the heater, they should stop cutting corners on quality."
1,Works Great...Then Not At All,"I have two of these machines. I live in a small studio, and they do a terrific job when they work. The trouble is, they both stopped working--one after a year, and the other after about six months. I turn it on, the little red light goes on and then nothing at all happens. Very frustrating. I get the idea from reading these reviews that others are having the same problems. Both financially and ecologically, these devices are too much of an investment to be a quick-use disposable. I hope Vornado does some serious rehabilitation to their design or their manufacturing process--whichever is at fault."
4,Keeps us warm,THE circulation paattern of the warm air keeps the room comfortable without ever getting a blast of hot air with no cold space.
4,1300 gsx,I bought a black vornado vh2 in dec 2001 and have used it in my bedroom every winter at night . the thermostsat goes to 55 deg on my home furnace at bed time. only problem i have had was the thermostat sticking on the vh2. they use a crude bimetal thermostat on my unit. I took it apart one time and repaired it. it's worked fine since.it's been a great unit and I would purchase another but after reading reviews I thought maybe they cheapened them up.I had 2 pelonis original ceramic disc heaters previously and this unit has been far more trouble free and cheaper (initially) for me.....
1,Not worth the premium price!,I have had my heater for less thank two months and the fan motor just stopped working. This is the third Vornado fan/heater I have purchased that has stopped working within a year. NEVER AGAIN! What a huge rip off!
1,costly product,"received heater pluggeed in didn't work at all, nothing zip, i have one in the basement and love it.No choice but to send back and pay 18.00 for shipping so ,a heater that didn't work and i do not have cost me 18.00, not really a profitable transaction won't buy from that company again. bought heater from another company works great, they should let you know that you will pay for the return shipping there and back if it doen't work. Other company free shipping and free returns can't beat that for a great little heater"
1,Do not recommend Vornado EH1-0034,"This did not heat our space - it might be best for a small space, like a bathroom. I had read a lot of good stuff about it, but perhaps i bought the wrong model."
3,Love 'em and Hate 'em,"These heaters are fantastic when they work, but they break. I bought two at roughly the same time and the on off switch broke on each within two weeks (of each other). The downside of these is the customer service. They will not sell you a replacement switch which should only cost two or three dollars or even give you information about where you could get a replacement switch. Your only option is to send the unit in for about $30. Mine has a Jun05 serial number, so maybe they have incorporated better quality switches on the new ones. Ours lasted about three years with 6pm to 12pm winter only use to supplement colder rooms. Would like to get replacements, but customer service rubs me the wrong way. Love em and hate em."
2,Really quiet but doesn't provide strong heat,"I'm in the process of finishing my basement (no supplemental heat) and I picked up this space heater to try to keep the basement comfortable (not too warm, but not too cold). A couple of notes:1. It definitely doesn't produce tremendous heat. I would have thought that it would have generated more heat based on others' feedback, but not to be.2. When you have it set to AUTO and the heater reaches the temperature you set, instead of turning off the fan and heater, it just shuts down the heater (the fan continues to run). I would have thought the entire device would have shutoff to save electricity.3. One thing I did love was that the chassis/grill never got hot (maybe because it didn't produce strong heat). I have 2 kids and I was looking for something that would be safe if they ever touched it.4. It was really quiet.I had hoped for better results but I'll be returning it to get my $100 back."
2,"noisy, finicky","I've had this for 18 mos. Something came loose in the body and it is now rather noisy. Also, there are times when I have to turn the unit off, then on, to get the heating element to engage. I'm keeping this one, but wouldn't buy it again."
2,Disappointing Product Support,"I just purchased my third Vornado Vortex Whole Room Heater in three years. The shortcoming is with the heating coils...the base of the coil breaks, the coil becomes loose from its mounting, representing a potential fire hazard. The unit must be factory serviced at...nearly the cost of buying new...I like the design controls and quiet operation. The VH2 heating coils are identical to the earlier VH model, so I don't expect these to last any longer - less than a year - before they represent the same hazard. Vornado warranty offered no re-design or retro-fit solution. This is a potential fire hazard so if you buy this, keep an eye on the coils for any breakage or insulators that have come loose."
3,Stingy Vornado wants money not function,"The heater does work. I'm not sure how much better it heats compared to other heaters as far as energy is concerned. It uses 1500 Watts on high and 750 on low, but it feels much cooler due to the wind chill factor.What really ticks me off is that Vornado in their stingy capacity to sell expensive products does not offer a ""no heat"" option with just the fan. In other words, they make sure you have to buy their fan AND their heater when just one could do both."
2,Does not heat anything,Purchased this for my basement. In a 50x50 room it did not increase the temperature after several hours by even 1 degree. My clock gives me the indoor and outdoor temperature and yes I even tried moving it.This week I had a slight water leak in my basement. I placed this heater on the maximum settings next to the water on the carpet for several hours. No change!I also have a regular Vornado fan and it's already broken since it's made out of cheap plastic. It barely moves the air and doesn't help at all.Vornado products are way overpriced.Believe it or not I went and purchased a cheap metal heater for fifteen dollars and it's way better. I feel MUCH safer with it on as well.I'm glad it works so well for many. It just doesn't for me. Save your receipt just in case!
1,Horrible Heater,"After reading through several good reviews brought this one from Costco.com and it turned out to be the worst purchase I had made.This heater does not even heat the immediate surrounding in my living room even at 90 degrees setting on the thermostat.Also, after using for 3 weeks I got an electricity bill of $500, which really scared the hell out of me. It is going to Costco back now.Don't ever think of buying this one."
1,Defective On/Off Switch,"I was very pleased with the product for the first 3 weeks, but one day it just would not turn on. I spent 80$ and hoped it would help us through the winter so I am very disapointed. I will not purchase a Vornado in the future."
3,Vernado AVH2 room heater,"The previous heater we had did a better job of heating up our bedroom, the Vernado is a disapointment so far. Sorry I did not do more in person research."
2,Vornado Heater,"This product was not up to past Vornado standards. It did a poor job of heating to 2 areas where tried. It was also noisy. I returned it for service. They replaced the motor, which was in stock, but could not complete the repair because they had no replacement power cords. At that point, I requested a refund which is in process. It takes 5 minutes to buy on line, but takes 5 days to process a credit card refund, go figure.This company has provided quality products at quality prices, I hope they are not going the way of so many American companies, failing to meet even mediocre standards."
1,Broke in under 1 month,"I wanted model EH1-0028-06 (the one highly rated by Good Housekeeping with the digital display). I could only find this model locally (EH1-0034-06). It worked great for a few weeks, then stopped warming, and would only blow cold air. I'm taking it back and ordering the other model online."
2,Underwhelmed,"I recently bought two of these heaters at a local retailer. I tried them out in our bathrooms since they stay a little cooler than the rest of the house. They did a fair job at best of heating those rather small areas. The heaters put off a lukewarm wimpy breeze. A hairdryer would be more effective. Needless to say, I returned them promptly since I don't think they are worth anywhere close to what I paid for them ($100 a piece). Don't waste your money on these heaters."
5,VORNADO HEATERS,"WE HAVE A VERY SMALL HOUSE AND THESE HEATERS TAKE CARE OF OUR HEATINGNEEDS PRESENTLY. I BOUGHT ONE SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND DECIDED TO TRYTWO MORE FOR THE REST OF THE LIVING SPACE. I WOULDN'T RECCOMEND THESE FORSOMEONE LIVING IN MORE THAN 1200 SQUARE FEET, THOUGH. THEY ARE GREAT FORSMALL ROOMS."
3,Danger!? Read all the reviews!,"I wish I'd read the reviews! I just got two of these. The vortex thing is very real. I don't know all this fluidics stuff, but even with the almost-inaudible fan (must not be broken yet), they project a beam of air many feet. Stirs up the room nicely, and makes sure 90% of your electric bill isn't being spent on keeping the mounted moose head over the mantlepiece toasty warm while you freeze.{Later} Hmm! Just read Levien's review. I wonder if that explains the earlier reports of breakage. Anyway, I'm using two of these things as of a few days ago, and I love them to pieces (until they go defective, if they do). I'm going to treat them as extremely fragile and avoid any intentional jarring. I looked in through the cracks after reading the bad reviews, and I don't care for the construction."
2,"Expensive and safe, but not effective","For $100, I expected it to be twice as good as my other $50 space heaters. But it isn't. It puts out warm (not hot) air and seems to keep the temperature in my 20' x 20' living room at about 64. If I'm lucky, the temperature will rise very slowly by one degree about every 30 minutes. But it never gets much past 64.I did find that if I blast the oven for a while and keep this heater on, the house gets to 68 and stays there. I guess the trick is that this type of heater doesn't really heat a room, but rather maintains the temperature of an already warm room."
1,"Bought Many, Very Disappointing","Although I bought the Vornado space heaters elsewhere, when I saw it is being sold on Amazon, I just had to write a review to save others the headache and cost.The Vornado space heater is the worst I have ever bought. I have a kennel with 4 indoor/outdoor runs, so I bought 4 there. Then I bought 3 more for the house. Two crapped out fairly quickly, then 2 more crapped out after the first year, the rest have crapped out after 3 years. So, if you want to risk 33% failure quickly, another 33% after you use it for a year, and the final 33% to fail over 3 years, have at it. I sure wish I hadn't made the investment.BTW, I called the company after the first ones died, and they refused to do anything for me, even though I made them aware of how many I purchased. The product and the company are both a waste of time."
2,Dead on Arrival,"Our AVH2 arrived dead right out of the box. Would not produce warm air at any setting whatsoever. Fan turns, but blows only cold air. Tried all temp settings, High/Low, factory reset procedure, nothing helped. Will update when replacement arrives."
2,Decent product but the fan konks out after a year or so.,"I purchased 2 of these and one lasted about 1 year and the second one lasted 2 years. I call Vornado to complain that they didn't seem very reliable, and they gave me a good deal on 2 new ones so I got 2 new ones. After barely a year, one of the new ones I got, konked out. The problem is always the same: the fan stops working.When they are working well, I have no major complaints, but when the same part keeps failing every time, you know that the part wasn't designed right. I'd like to rate this higher but the reliability is unacceptable. I have a $20 el cheapo space heater that I bought at the local hardware store and it just keeps on working (doesn't have all the fancy temperature settings), but the fancy stuff is not what is breaking on the Vornado space heater, it is the fan."
3,Good Heating; poor temperature control for small rooms,Heats up small rooms ~100-150 sq ft quite fast and uniformly. The problem is that the heater does not turn off. There is a analog/manual thermostat; however the heat element continues to heat the room even after set-point is reached. i.e. if the thermostat is set to 73F; the temperature can creep up to 83 within a few hours. Returned item.
5,hot and quiet,I have used this company's fans for over ten years and was pleased to find the heater to have the same excellent quality. Well worth a little extra up front price for years of trouble free service
4,I Knew Exercise Could Kill Ya!,This outing is one of the best Iris House books. The characters are surprising and the identity of the killer is uncertain until the end because of the red herrings and side stories! It's a great book to toss in the beach bag...just don't take any handweights along!
5,Another fun entry in a great cozy series,"This series just keeps getting better. Tess Darcy is a very likable and believable heroine. The plots are interesting and keep the reader hooked, and the characters are well-defined and three-dimensional. The author describes a realistic setting that makes the reader want to check in to the Iris House."
1,Too afraid of edited versions,The Hulu versions are edited. The Season 1-3 DVD versions are not. I want the DVD full-length versions. There is too much hilarity removed if anything is edited out.
1,Another NO DVD NO SALE,I'm not going to get screwed. Basically they are trying to swindle their loyal fans and make them pay more. This is what drives people to trade files. I have my credit card ready. I buy lots of stuff. But I'm not going to get screwed.
5,"Way over priced, but i love it.","Green Acres is one of my favorite shows from my childhood. if you like over the top goofy comedy, it is hard to beat. the cost of the last 3 seasons is absurd. I wish they still made comedy like this. Eva is such a babe. One of my favorite lines of hers is ""You new i couldn't cook when you married me. But i do great Zsa Zsa Gabor impressions."""
1,May as well enter 'my' vote...,"Even though I've personally burned all seasons onto DVD from TV dubs from the 80's, I'm with everyone else here.Screw streaming and downloads. Give us the rest of the series on high-quality dvd's!MGM is 'not' a stupid company, yet expecting people to watch crappy low-res copies is an insult."
1,DVD's Please,"At my cabin in the mountains, we have no internet service or T.V. reception. We do have a DVD player hooked up to an old T.V. I already have the first 3 seasons of Green Acres on DVD and I would love to get the rest of them on DVD too. I would rate 5 stars if it was on DVD."
1,How About A Real Set?,"I will break my own law and comment on something I haven't seen, but it's because I CANNOT watch it! For this price we really deserve the DVD set as real DVDs!"
1,HEY MGM/UA: Ratio of Green Acres fans who want it online only...,"REALLY????? O.K., so MGM/UA is trying to save money by not releasing DVDs of GREEN ACRES beyond the third season. DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND that a great majority of the fans of this show are either 1.) Of the age where they don't want to bother with downloading this stuff, or, 2.) Rabid collectors who who want to have this show on a tangible, hard-disc format to add to their collections? You're marketing this show incorrectly for most of the people who'd want it!And now, with MGM's adoption of the MOD format for certain films, why not do at least the same for TV series?; burn copies as people order them.Come on, there are DVD sets out there for some of the worst TV series ever made. The least you could do is give us DVD-Rs of a classic comedy series like this one."
1,I'm With Everyone Else,I will not pay for just a download; I want the DVD in hand. I hope the point is clear.
1,Why isn't there a dvd release?,"I have been waiting for season 4 for YEARS now and now we get this?this is like spitting in the face of the fans,,it's lame.I will ONLY buy seasons 4-6 on dvd.."
1,"Bad, bad, bad","Hey Amazon I love Green Acres, but I will only purchase seasons 4, 5 and 6 on DVD. If they never get offered that way I guess I will never own them."
1,Big Disappointed Its Not Available in DVD,"After patiently waiting for Seasons 4-6 to appear on DVD and frequently checking Amazon for them, we were sadly disappointed we couldn't get them on DVD. We have a DVD player in our van that the kids watch. We can't take a download on long trips nor can we show them on any of our televisions. We want DVDs, not files that can be lost when our computer crashes or when we clean the hard drive."
1,NO WAY! Give us DVD'S!!!!!,Sad. charging that much an episode and they aren't even yours. There is a large enough market to warrant selling seasons 4-6! We want DVD's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,What Next?!,"First Facebook screws with their format. Then Netflix does the same. Now, I can't get Season 4 unless I download it from this new Amazon thing. Some of us just want things simple as they were. No, I don't need 100 buttons on my remote and I don't need my phone to do my taxes for me. Can we just get some DVDs? Some of us aren't so quick to fill landfills with our old devices when something new comes along. Some of us still have DVD players. It would have been nice for Christmas this year. We would have bought all three remaining seasons."
1,I WON'T BUY THIS!,I LOVE GREEN ACRES.I refuse to pay this outrageous price for a NOTHING product. Put this out on DVD please. I urge anyone who has paid the price to upload it to HULU. Serves them right. $40 for what?
5,Loch Ness Monster is definitely worth every penny!!,"All these tunes are great! Whether it be rolling sea shanties you can sing along to, all out dancing tunes, or wonderfully humorous silly songs, they all are songs that you will listen to again and again! These guys are so wonderful I even had them play at my wedding reception! They also have several other great CD's! Give them a try, you won't be disappointed!!"
5,X-files meets Monty Python,"This CD breaks me up every time I listen to it. From the groovy finger-snapping ""Crawfish Man"" to a version of ""Loch Ness Monster"" that would make Spinal Tap proud, this CD has something for everyone."
3,Not the UK band,"Just to avoid confusion, this is not the UK band that released ""Formica Blues"" a few years ago but a Japanese instrumental band. (I haven't heard the CD, but it's on John Zorn's label so it's probably cool.) The UK Mono's singer Siobhan De Mare is now in a band called Violet Indiana (with former Cocteau Twins Robin Guthrie), which you should certainly check out if you miss Mono."
4,Graceful emulations,"Revisiting this Japanese quartet's excellent post-rock debut, one is reminded that when the genre sticks it is sometimes not because of what you play, but how you play it. Mono can repeat simplified statements at their foundation, but it works so well because of the underlying flow and commitment to spiritual depth inside all the subtle playing. At times it can almost lift Mogwai's early-era playbook, but in fact emulates that haunted melodic minimalism far more incisively."
4,I'll keep this brief,"Great record. Fans of Mogwai will undoubtedly hear the similarities, but it's hardly derivative. Mono reminds me much more of Explosions In The Sky, whose cd ""Those Who tell The Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell The Truth Shall Live Forever"" is equally remarkable. Although ""Under the Pipal Tree"" lacks the orchestral touches of GYBE or ASMZ, it is a similarly affecting cd, and one that fans of instrumental rock should find an extremely rewarding listen."
3,mono is not mono,"If you found this title by clicking on the link from the album ""Life in Mono,"" you will be unhappy to find that this band is not that band. This mono sounds more like placebo than it does portishead. It is ok music, but don't get your hopes up."
1,this is very bad,dont order this iteam made me very sick i flie clam on them wount renter my money they dont care if you get sick dont buy this
3,Not what I expected,Well the package came sooner then was expected. But I was disappointed to the size of it. I figured size 2 was going to be small but the hole was rather large looked more like a size 4 tip. Its too late to return it due to the fact I needed this for wedding pops I was making Im just going to buy it at a store now. Also it suggested these couplers and no surprise this tip was way too big for the couplers.
4,HP Printer toner cartridge,It was shipped quickly and came as described. No problems with the product.
5,Support for budding poets!,"George Ella Lyon's, ""Where I'm From,"" is a wonderful gem for giving teachers of young poets an accessible link to how a writer thinks, imagines, and prepares to write a poem. The collection is perfect for teachers that want to launch a new year with an opportunity for students to do some writing. The signature poem, ""Where I'm From,"" can be used to model student writing that invites everyone to share something about themselves and begin the process of building community in the classroom. Ms. Lyons has a very down-to-earth way of expressing her encouragement to budding writers. There is a poet in all of us, and this book will help students find their writing ""voice."""
3,Functions but not an OEM replacement fit,It works but the diameter is a little smaller than the original and has only two arms to contact the coupler. Because of the smaller diameter it does not self-center and I am guessing this is why they have only two arms on the coupler side. I works but I wish I had gotten the OEM version or a better match to the OEM version. If you do not carefully center this part in the glass it will wear quickly.
5,Easy Fix,"I just replaced my old Cutter Blade Assembly with this and it works perfectly. I do see a trace of grease on the underside after use, as I did on the original, but no leak of the contents. After seeing the grease on the new one, I'm not sure that I even needed to replace the old one, as it is on the outside and did not cause a leak or contaminate the contents. At any rate, I now have two Cutter Blade Assemblys and both work fine."
2,Replacement blade,I ordered this to replace my original blade assembly. It seems that the original got very hot after using the blender and it did not move freely. It almost seems like it needed oiling. I take good care of my kitchen machines and use hot soapy water and dry the parts. The new replacement part that I ordered was not as free moving as I thought either but definitely an improvement.Not sure what the answer is but oiling is not food safe and perhaps KitchenAid would want to know that their product may need some improvement or at least some instruction on how to care better for the part.
2,Blender blade - not identical to original item,"the rubber gears on the bottom of the blade did fit our blender, but were not the same as the original. Only two rubber tabs, clearly cheaper than what was replaced.Fit was not perfect, but good enough to work without leaking if it was st up carefully."
3,Kitchen Aid Blender Cutter Blade Assembly,Bought this to replace the old one but after using it for awhileit sheared the rubber coupler notches off so I had to purchaseanother coupler with a removal tool and when my husbandchanged it now the blender doesn't work.
5,an absolute masterpiece,"Louder Than Bombs is arguably The Smiths' best compilation album during their career. It contains mostly new songs such as Panic, London, Sheila Take a Bow, etc. are all exclusive to this album. I'm surprised that this album wasn't put out as a studio album.It is a must own for the 80s music fans."
4,Comprehensive and Specific Guidance,This was a comprehensive overview of the publishing and marketing of one's book complete with anecdotes and actual examples from real life.
2,"Nice looking display, but died shortly after warranty period","This display worked well and looked nice, but died after 20 months' use. It just stopped turning on. It was a good value when I bought it, but now it doesn't seem so good because I need a replacement.The location of the buttons is good for appearance, but makes the OSD very difficult to use, and it's not particularly user-friendly either."
1,"Beautiful colors, until it dies in less than 2 years","Bought this about 2 years ago at Best Buy because it was on sale for under $400 and it was brighter and more vivid than the other 24"" monitors on display. Never had any problems with it and loved it while it worked. About a week ago it started hissing (like LCDs do right before they die) and now it will not turn on. Had I known my $400 investment would have not even lasted me two years, no way would I have bought it. $400 is certainly not an amount of money I can throw away every two years for a disposable monitor. This is unacceptable.I also have a Samsung 22"" monitor that is on the same computer and it is 4 or 5 years with no problems."
3,"Great monitor, but major problems",Monitor is wonderful for those who want a non TN panel for graphics work. The panel has really accurate colors. This monitor has a known overheating problem on the HDMI port - and Westinghouse support is pretty terrible at fixing it. Just search on the internet forums and you will know about the headaches. I returned mine because of another known problem - the inverter buzzes loudly when the brightness is below 98 percent.
5,Good value,"I bought a pair of these babies and I am very happy with them. A nice set of inputs, very clear, the controls seem intuitive enough to me (despite some other's opinions on that), and reasonable price point. At first I found them too bright, so I turned the brightness down to a value of 50. The next day I tied 30. A day or two later I took the setting down to 0, which seems the right level of brightness for me anyway. I wasn't looking to suntan in front of these things. ;-)"
2,A big dissapointment,"I bought my Westinghouse monitor two months ago. When I first set it up, I was pleased with the picture...clarity, sharpness, blacks and colors; however, when I started using it for my photography (which is my primary use), the screen turns a blue tint, then changes to pink, then a light tan. It makes correcting photographs nearly impossible...no flashing, but a gentle color change.Fortunately, I purchased it at Sam's Club and they will accept the return. I have not decided which monitor I will purchase next, but no more Westinghouse for me. Possibly Westinghouse doesn't have the proven experience yet. Previously, I had a flat screen 19"" LCD NEC and was extremely happy with it, but after 4 years it died.Any suggestions from readers who also are photo nuts??? I would appreciate your input. Thanks and God bless you. Joy"
3,Some stock barrels better,"This barrel is pretty light and cheap, but that's about it. My stock Empire Axe barrel is definitely more accurate.If I were to buy again, I would stick with stock, or upgrade to a Stiffi."
3,"Good gloves for money, with one issue","These gloves are decent quality, with good leather, and are excellent for the price. They protected my hand nicely from a slip with an angle grinder. However, the right glove has a seam which runs right over my pinky, which gets quite uncomfortable quickly. The other glove is fine, so this makes me think it's a quality problem, and not a design problem."
3,Good and durable,"These are good quality work gloves. They're comfortable and I feel good working in them. I don't expect them to last forever, but at the price, I can buy several pairs for the same as I might for a pair of more expensive deer-skin ones."
5,"Great Price, Great Value","I needed some gloves to use once a week for firewood. These are perfect. Great price, great quality. I've had them a few months and they still work great."
3,"Good presentation, need to hire new proofreaders","This book was an excellent way to teach myself high school math after a 25 year hiatus. The presentation was understandable and fairly easy to go through. The only problem I have with the book is the number of typos. There are several review problems with incorrect answers listed in the answer key. A good math student would recognize these for what they are - typos. However a student who is on shaky ground with Course II to begin with, and buys this book hoping to improve his understanding of the material, may become confused by incorrect answers in the keys. He would probably think HIS answer was wrong, and not have the faintest idea why. As I said, though, if it weren't for the typos, it is a fairly good way to review, relearn, or even LEARN the Course II material."
1,Quite Dissapointed With This Book,"The writing is good and the humor is fun and the author sounds like a witty a guy. However, the book is more of an unabridged sales brochure for the sale of commercial self-steering systems. This book is basically a relative comparison of commercial/turn-key products to guide purchase. For those sailors who can solve all problems with the check book, this is fine. For those of us who are builders, this book is of little if any use.>Raysv. Milenka IIPs. For a much more indepth view of self-steering, theory and practice, I recommend Letcher's book on the subject."
4,Del Shannon : Keep Searchin' Contents,"Sue's gonna be mine, Kelly, The answer to everything, Needles & pins, Two kinds of teardrops, You never talked about me, Mary Jane, Broken Promises, Keep Searchin I'll follow the sun, Over you, Give her lots of lovin, The Search, Lies, She still remembers Tony, Break up, Move it on over. 1963-1965"
4,Del Shannon Hits The High Notes!,"From the early to mid 1960s Del Shannon recorded some very distinctive songs, some were to become big hits for other artists, for example (Marie's The Name) His Latest Flame, Hey Baby and World Without Love. For me these do not quite work.What does work are the wonderful Runaway, the similar sounding Hats Off To Larry, I Go To Pieces, Handy Man and to top them all, Little Town Flirt.A very good collection of oringinal artist oringinal recordings and interesting information notes."
2,Fake Allen Edmonds Cody Loafers?,"Just received a pair of Allen Edmonds Cody Loafers ordered from Amazon today. I bought my first pair a couple of years ago from Zappos. Loved the fit,finish and classic styling of my first pair. The pair I received today were so cheap looking as to look like counterfeits. Uneven leather color. Both were 8.5 D but everything about this new pair was different. Each of my old shoes weighed 1.2 pounds and the new ones were 1.0 pound a piece; the fit was not good. I hope these are counterfeits! If they are not, Allen Edmonds has really gone downhill. If I pay $350 for a pair of shoes, I expect $350 shoes. Sent them back today."
4,One issue,"My daughter was very excited to paint her horse. The biggest difficulty we ran into that the horse kept on falling over while she was applying paint. If it can with a stand that held it in place while being painted, I would have rated it 5-stars."
4,nice kit,"A very nice kit, perfect for my 11 year old horse lover! I would definitely buy more kits like this!"
4,Great for artists and horse-lovers,"Our daughter is a budding artist, who also happens to love horses. This set is perfect for her. It contains 2 unpainted horses, plus all the paint and brushes needed to complete the project. The models are relatively small, good for smaller hands to hold while painting. Obviously, how ""professional"" they turn out will depend on the patience and skill of the child, but as every parent knows, they will still be treasured by the one who made them."
5,Great project for young teens.,"I purchased this for my 13 year old daughter. She collects Breyer Horses and this project was perfect for her. Some of the reveiws said it was hard to paint, but my daughter had no problem. She really enjoyed painting the horses and I was surprise how well they turned out. I would recommend this for any young teen who likes horses. My daughter does not do alot of arts and crafts, but this one was a hit."
5,A joint crowd pleaser!,"I think this item is great for kids. I gave it as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She enjoyed painting the horse and since there are two in the kit, she even let her twin brother join in the artistic endeavor. They both had fun."
3,not happy with the shoulder strap,"The shoulder strap positioner is uncomfortable and way too easy/tempting for a 4-year-old to remove! We're working on it, but it's hard to explain why he has to keep that neck-rubbing belt on his shoulder when grandma isn't fond of her shoulder strap either :)"
2,Not good-looking at all,"I purchased a set for my Dakota and was disappointed in the appearance and quality. The mats appear to be manufactured by taking a sheet of thin polyethelyne (or a similar material) and stamping out the approximate shape needed to fit the vehicle's floor. Then the ""raised lip"" is apparently placed around this sheet and fused in place. This process is evidently very sloppy, the effect is almost as if black roofing cement has been brushed over the seams. The machinery or molds that form the sheet also seem to be badly worn and/or dirty...the liners are spotted with many small bits of debris, and some of the ""diamond plate"" pattern is badly distorted, as if it was damaged by heat during the process of fusing the two pieces together. None of this sloppiness was evident in the photos on the manufacturer's website or brochure. I worked in a plastics factory years ago and we NEVER would have let anything that looked like this be shipped to a customer."
4,Fine military look at the defeat of the Fascist Italians,"A day by day, group by group look at this remarkable chapter of history and Wingate's role in it."
5,Terrific Chai,Second time I have order this and is just as good the this time. Good deal ordering thru Amazon and tastier than what I can get at Starbucks. Will keep it stocked in my cupboard.
5,The BEST,"I couldn't agree more with the other 5 star reviews about Oregon Chai's Vanilla Latte -it simply is the best and much cheaper than making a stop at Starbucks everyday! I've never cared for the concentrate versions (they always seem a little too sweet) as much as the individual powder mixes from Oregon Chai. It's all about adding just a bit of milk to make it taste just right! As mentioned in another review, for some reason stores everywhere seem to no longer be carrying this particular product and I have no idea why when the shelf was always sold out when they did stock it. I'm just happy to be able to stop searching now that I've found it on Amazon so it's never a crisis when I run out."
3,Not good for tourists,"This tape course is great for people who really want/need in-depth Japanese lessons or review. You get a good idea of sentence structure and pronunciation. However, if you are trying to learn some basic Japanese for a short-term trip, this is not the tape for you. You need to know how to ask for basic items (food, beverages, train tickets, the bathroom). I've travelled to Japan once, and plan to go again, and I don't think I'll need to know how to say ""It's a big new car"" or ""Let's go to a concert"" to a total stranger on the street. Buy this tape if you need some support for reglar Japanese lessons, or just want to generally improve your understanding of the language for business or regular travel. Nice set-up, but not practical for day-to-day needs."
5,Yatta!,"I have tried many many programs and classes to learn a language and this has been amazing! I listen to a track or two when running errands. I only procede when I fully understand the previous tracks. It's great because I can work at my own pace and not someone elses. I know there have been complaints that you can't learn how to read/write with this products, but that's not what this product is for. besides- toddlers learn speech before they learn how to spell and write."
5,Fuctional and Sturdy,"I'm very happy with this bookshelf. It came with all necessary pieces. It was very easy to assemble, with clear instructions. Most importantly, it's a nice sturdy piece of reasonably-priced utilitarian furniture."
4,FITS IN NARROW SPACING!,WE LIVE IN THE CITY WHERE SPACE IS EVERYTHING! MY DAUGHTER HAS EASY ACCESS TO HER BOOKS>>> THE TOP SHELF IS STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD HER AIR PURIFIER AND OTHER BOARD BOOKS!
3,"Not happy, but hope company fixes problem","I think I will like this shelf a lot but I won't really know for a while because the box contained two left panels so I can't finish putting it together. I am not happy that I had to scan, fax, or email the invoice sheet and proof of order to the company. You can't just call and get it taken care of at the moment. So I will know more when I see how long it takes to get the right part. I should of read more of the reviews, it seems this happens a lot with this company!!!!"
5,Product Review,This book shelf is made of quality hard wood and when assembled is very strong and sturdy. The assembly is very easy and the directions are easy to follow. Be careful of the different size screws. there are 4 short screws and the rest are long screws. The alan wrench that is included fits both size screws. The short screws are for the top shelf. I realized this after I had already used 2 of them for the lower selfs so I had to backtrack. Other than that this shelf is a very good addition to your home office or entertainment area.
1,Not solid wood and way too small,"I spent $60 on this product because the description said its solid wood. Its not. It is made of engineered wood, where they glue pieces together to create a solid look. So what's the problem? Nothing if you don't care, but I know that engineered wood and MDF wood is not good for little kids due to the glue fumes, and since I have a little girl at home, I spend hours trying to find non toxic products to buy. So when this bookshelf arrived, I was felt cheated. Its also too small, even for kid sized books, unless they are the very tiny books that 1-2 year old kids read. It is cute however and just the right size for little ones, but just not functional for holding books. I will be returning this."
4,Great display shelf,"This is a great little addition to my kitchen. It is enough space for my small cookbooks. Note that only books with a height of 10"" or smaller will fit into the slanted shelves, but that's not a problem because you can put larger books displayed face up on the bottom shelf, which is nice as well. The top counter is a perfect spot for displaying my mini tea collection. It is a simple bookcase, very cozy looking. It took about an hour to put together. The only thing to make this perfect would be if there were some stickers to cover the visible screws on the sides. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this item."
3,"map book review/ Atlanta, Ga.","I drive a semi in the southeast and needed a new map book of Atlanta Ga.. This book is up to date & with great detail. The only problem why did they print in on 9 x 11 paper? The pages are small and hard to read, other map books use a larger format.If it was larger print I would rate it a 5, but due to the small size a 3......My Jax and Miami books have less detail but a lot easier to see..............."
5,Best book I've ever read...It will keep me FOCUSed,"My pastor (Ron Barker) let me read his book ""Full Surrender"". This has got to be the best book on walking the walk I have ever read. In the most practical way it describes all the questions I have ever had and conflicts that exsist in my life. This book should be kept close to you at all times. No telling how many sermons and bible studies have or will come from here!!!"
3,Still Crazy After All These Years - CD,The sound is not good at all. Will definitely think twice before ordering any more CD's with this type of reproduction.
2,Two and a half stars,"Though there are some great songs here, this album finds Paul Simon beginning to run out of creative energy. It's all getting to sound by-the-book and it doesn't always sound like he's happy to be making music. There are two great songs - 50 Ways and My Little Town; and the title track, while subdued and downcast feeling, has a spooky, dreamy atmosphere and heartfelt vocal. Have A Good Time *might* sound better if he had someone else sing it, i.e. a female. To hear him wail away in a whiny falsetto for the WHOLE SONG is only slightly less grating than Prince's 'Kiss'. No wonder Art Garfunkel did all the falsetto stuff on the S&G albums. The rest of it is not bad, but suffers from blandness. No real catchy hooks or anything to make you remember the music. As far as the musicianship goes, it's top-notch throughout the album."
3,correction to the editorial review,"Track 1 (the title track) of this album has perhaps one of the greatest jazz/fusion tenor sax solos ever recorded by the late virtuoso Michael Brecker (RIP). As a s sax player, I cant sit here idily and read this aggregious error. Phil Woods is a great contemporary saxophonist, but he did not record this solo."
5,EXCELLENT Book!,"This book is invaluable to anyone who doesn't live a 100% health- conscious life. I've lost 27 lbs. in two months doing this cleanse, and I haven't even followed it to the absolute letter. Using Sonne's #7 and Nature's Secret Super Cleanse products while following the basic eating guidelines in this book has yielded wonderful results for me in a short amount of time. I suffer with fibromyalgia, but so did one of the authors of this book. She was able to get her health back, so I have that hope now as well."
3,Cancer support books,"This book is very comprehensive -- in fact maybe more than most people need. In going through cancer treatment with a loved one, there is so much to do and reading a book along with trying to keep notes on what to do and what not to do just adds to the feeling of being overwhelmed. Plus when a patient is only convinced that traditional medicine works, it's difficult to incorporate a complete change of lifestyle into the picture. I'm sure the information in this book works because it makes sense, but it's not helping my situation with my loved one, unfortunately. I did buy a juicer and we are enjoying fresh juice almost every day -- so maybe that alone will have some benefit."
5,Great book.,"Here's another good book to check out if you are researching what to do if you have cancer or just want to improve your health and diet. Yes, I'd recommend this book."
5,"Fantastic, factual information on natural ways to help with cancer.",The Complete Cancer Cleanse is a book full of information to educate people about the benefits of natural ways to treat cancer. The author Cherie Calbom teaches about the ways to incorporate diet and juicing together with cleanses for all parts of the body to create a balanced body where cancer cannot survive.There is a true life story of a cancer survivor and also the emotional issues that may affect cancer sufferers are dealt with.
5,Wow,"Lydia McCauley's new CD ""Entrances"" is truelyamazing. Her lucid volcals will echeo through your house. Lydia's hassome first class musicians that have mastered her intergraded songs. This is album is a must for anyone who loves music. Lydia has put 100% into this album, and it shows. She worked wih Kurt Schere to produce one of the best sounding CDs I have in my collection. Audio entuseiest will be very happy to own a copy."
2,Great.... if they lasted,"I've had a pair of these for 9 months. In the nine months, I've had to glue to bottom back on twice, and the heel has worn into a wedge. The heel started wearing sharply within 3 weeks.If they lasted, given the comfort and look , i'd give them 5 stars."
2,THE ETERNAL DESTRUCTION,"TOny Iommi has all the right in the world to continue the Black Sabbath saga and continue to produce albuns bearing this name. But I think he should not have the right to destroy SABBATH reputation forever, till the point of changing Sabbath into a great joke, with people not being capable of knowing the musicians'name, with failed attempts to write somekind of ""gothic"" metal ( whatever this is !! )"
2,Awful,"The Ozzy era was great. The Dio era was great. Born Again with Ian was great. I personally enjoyed Seventh Star. But the downfull began with one man Tony Martin. Tony Martin Black Sabbath suffers because the albums might have one good song, and the rest is crap. On Eternal Idol, The Shining is a pretty decent song. But the rest of the album is pure filler. Same with Headless Cross, the title track was good, the rest of the album mediocre at best. Now we get to TYR and the whole album sucks. In the entire History of Black Sabbath, Tony Martin stands out as a sore thumb and a very bad mistake. Granted the man can sing, but he doesn't belong in Black Sabbath."
3,"Good Comeback, Debut with Martin","This album is solid, not outstanding by any means, but it does do the job of putting Black Sabbath back on track, after a lot of confusion in the mid 80s. Songs such as ""Glory Ride"", ""Nightmare"", and ""Born to Lose"" carry this album well. The real gem, though, is the title track, which IMO, is one of the best post-ozzy songs out there for Sabbath. I listen to this album every once in awhile, it gets me pumped when I hear it. I usually listen to the later stuff, but what this album does, it does well. Get it if you're a true Black Sabbath fan (not an ozzy fan in disguise) and appreciate well-thought out, steady riffs."
3,A good album,"Released in 1987, The Eternal Idol is Black Sabbath's thirteenth studio album. Nine tracks are contained--one of these is an instrumental, ""Scarlet Pimpernel."" The material is in a hard rock musical direction. I find the songwriting to be tight, the musicianship to be solid, and the sound quality to be satisfying. Tony Iommi provides enjoyable guitar work, and Tony Martin turns out an admirable performance in the singing department. ""Ancient Warrior"" and ""Glory Ride"" are my favorite cuts. The driving ""Ancient Warrior"" supplies interesting-sounding keyboard playing from Geoff Nicholls, especially at song's beginning. Martin's vocals are cool during the refrain of ""Glory Ride."" As for the album cover artwork, it is interesting. The disc is just over 43 minutes. The Eternal Idol is recommended."
2,The beginning of the end.,"Tony Iommi should have quited the band while there was time. (read: when Dio left. TOny Martin, the singer in this album, is a worstened copy of Ronnie James Dio, and the constant flow of musicians coming in and out of the band brought an absolute lack of musical character to them."
2,"NOT BAD AT ALL, BUT....","THis album is not bad at all, but it was recorded amidst great internall turmoil around the band, and this fact unfortunately made itself felt in this recording. The album passed through the hands of THREE (!!) producers: Jeff Glixman, Chris Tsangarides and one Vic somewhat; two bass players (Bob Daisley and Dan Spitz), two drummers (Bev Bevan and Eric Singer). The result was a somewhat dispersed album, with good tunes, average tunes and mediocre tunes. Singer Tony Martin was a plesant surprise, but one can clearly see that he's singing like the guys that sings for Yngwie Malmsteen, for example..."
2,Ozzy vs. Martin and Dio,I agree with some of you that Tony Martin and Ronnie Dio are great singers but to say they are better then Ozzy that is a comment not even worth saying. They have extremely different styles and to say Ozzy cant sing like those two is wrong because he can... Its not the style he likes so he doesnt sing that way... This is a descent album... better then most 80's music(My oppinion of course)... I believe Ozzy is much more talented then Dio or Martin...But dont count them out they can hold their own quite well
5,The Best of the Tony Martin Era,"In my opinion, the Tony Martin era of Black sabbath has been tragically overlooked. Along with Headless Cross, the Eternal Idol represents the best of that era. While Ozzy was garnering sales for straight ahead commercial metal like the Ultimate Sin, Tony Iommi had assembled a killer band, including the Dio-esque Tony Martin on Lead Vocals and the legandary Eric Singer on Drums. The power of this assemblage is immediately apparent on the opening track of The Eternal Idol, ""The Shining."" This song is catchy without compromising its power and creepiness. Iommi's playing on this album is top shelf, and standout riffs include, ""Born to Lose,"" ""Lost Forever,"" and ""The Eternal Idol(title track)"" This album, as with most Tony Martin Black sabbath albums, will appeal more to fans of the Ronnie James Dio-era stuff, than it will to the Ozzy purists. It is however, essential to any Iommi disciple or Sabbath completest. Killer stuff."
3,"Not Bad, but not True Sabbath","This is not a bad album, but in all fairness, I'm stubborn. I have a hard time thinking of Sabbath as TRUE sabbath unless Geezer's at least in the band. Of the albums with only Tony Iommi, this is the best one I've heard.That said, Justin Carulli wrote that Glen Hughes was fired for his slaughtering of ""War Pigs"", & that most people know the story. I've never heard what happened, & can't find the details. Can someone elaborate on that for me? (I APOLOGISE FOR SUCH A POOR REVIEW, BUT MAINLY WAS ASKING THE QUESTION.)"
3,Overlooked In It's Time,"Too bad that this didn't get much attention when first relesaed; it's not that bad. Sure the vocalist revolving door is becoming a joke (Ozzy,Dio, Ian Gillan,Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillan), and this one is the debut of unknown newcomer Tony Martin, who sounds like a more tolerable version of Dio. Iommi is firmly in control of this band, providing some of his best material in years. It would prove to be the best effort of the Martin era, with ""The Shining"",""Hard Life To Love"", and the title track as standouts."
3,3.5 stars,"A nice album by Black Sabbath . Its like Seventh Star. Its a good one but there is no comparison to older albums which from Black Sabbath to Sabotage were much better. I believe that after Ozzy and the classic albums Black Sabbath changed also there music. They don't have so much fan or so nice melodies , they sound a little bit tired and boring. I suggest this album to all Black Sabbath fans and to some metal fans who like a metal album for easy - listening"
4,Great - But You Must Like History,"I have read about 15 James A. Michener books, so I thought it was time to try this one. I wasn't disappointed, for I enjoyed all the detail. By comparison I find Michener to be a better writer, however Rutherfurd probably outdoes even Michener, for all the historical details. Bottom line: If you like historical novels, have enough endurance, I recommend this book. I have obtained another of Rutherfurd's books, ""London."" It is another really long one, which I expect will be very educational. That's why I read this type of book; to get history in a fun, enjoyable format."
5,A magnificent saga of families through history,"This is a sweeping historical saga in the Michener vein, with clearly drawn characters and some of the most beautiful countryside in England. What makes it particularly interesting is that the story happens around and along side the great events of history, making the characters and the story all the more believable. It was a sensation when published, and rightly so. It is wonderful."
3,Interminable,This novel started out great and I could not put it down but as time went on it seemed to get less and less interesting and I am now reduced to forcing myself to finish it. It has gotten bogged down in minute historical data.
2,Just Started This Book,I just started this as some light summer reading. I literally burst out laughing when the author mentions the cultivation of corn in Stone Age England. This is not promising.
1,Use it to torture P.O.W.s,"this book was written to torture Honors British Literature students. It's lengthy with pointless historical tidbits... if you're reading this book, you've got to be obsessed with british history already, so why bother with length historical information? And you'd think the book would be able to stay afloat with it's character insights, but they just come out cliched. The gay priest, the nymphomaniac native, the athiest turned monk, the stupid slut, the tortured artisan, come on! We've seen this stuff before, and written ten times better to boot. The dreary 1000 pages used in the printing of this novel could have been used for a better cause...toilet paper for third world countries is a great example...but since it's already too late, I've discovered my copy of Sarum is extremely flammable and doubles as an excellent torture device."
4,Great Read!!,This is my 3rd book by this author andi have to say i love it..im a huge history nerd and he just makes it so enjoyable to learn even more history. definitely reading everything he has so far and a big recommend for him to all history lovers.
5,Worth the read if you enjoy Historical fiction,"This book brought to life so much of what I have seen in England, Stonehenge, Cornwall and The influence of the European continent."
4,Great book!,"For history buffs, this is the entire history of Great Britain told from a unique viewpoint that will add a great deal of perspective to other historical works on the subject. Very enjoyable."
3,"good, but too much","This is a very well done, well written book. The plot is smooth, the details are very nice, and you can actually conjure up the sights and smells of Salisbury through time.However, it is just too much of a good thing. It is long - a true endurance test. At times, I thought more about how much I had to go than what was happening in the story...Additionally, the ending - the final few paragraphs - I understand how he brings it full circle, and his intent on what he wants the reader to understand. But without giving it away, I think it could be better.Overall, I'm glad I've read this book. Just wish that it was two books instead of 1."
2,Disappointed,"I read the rave reviews and this sounded like a book I would love. I did enjoy the beginning, the prehistoric period, the building of Stonehenge and the cathedral. After that it all went downhill. I was very confused with all the families, where many had the same first names over generations. It finally became a chore and I put it down at about 550 pages."
3,Enjoyable read but not deep,"I liked this book because I enjoy historical fiction. Some sections were better than others, but many sections seemed like a recitation of known events (kind of like some of Michener's lesser works, eg Poland). Still, I enjoyed it and don't regret buying it. I've also received The Forest as a gift and will look forward to reading that soon. I particularly liked his handling of how families/family names morphed over time in Sarum."
3,Worth the Effort and Time to Read,"What struck me most about this book is the author's premise of the strength of genetic traits. The Forest-Wilson family, decended from the original people of Sarum, retain physical attributes and character traits over an 8,000+ year period. They are portrayed as thieves and womanizers in various epochs of the tale. Likewise the Mason family retains their short stature and craftmanship ability. This is an interesting premise--but true? I know this is a work of historical-fiction in the latter half and pure speculation in the former, but it is entertaining. Thank goodness for the ""family tree"" at the front of the book. It was difficult for me to keep up with the families over the 1,000+ pages. From the aspect of writing style, I much preferred The Pillars of the Earth."
5,An Epic Journey You'll Never Forget,"Edward Rutherfurd takes us on an epic journey with this Novel. We start at the end of the last ice age and follow five families through the history of one place, Sarum. Because it is an island, it is more, but not altogether isolated from the rest of the region. The relationship between the families is a crucial and sometimes life threatening part of this saga.We follow the Wilsons, Porters and Masons through the erection of Stonehenge and rise and fall of the Roman Empire. Rutherfurd uses factional events to guide fictional families through the millennia as the story seems to enfold around you while it emotionally bonds to the characters. Rutherfurd had me so involved in the story that I was somewhat sad when it ended. I will definitely be reading his other novels."
3,Great read,"This book, Sarum, by Edward Rutherford, is an excellent book, both entertaining and historically informative.This book purchased in ""used"" condition, was obviously just that, and not too kindly. The cover, as anticipated was a bit tattered, but the exposed ends of the leaves were pretty soiled. I would have purchased a new one for the price differential."
2,"Exceedingly clever idea, awkwardly written, badly punctuated","This novel provides for me a palatable way to get a history of England, and I am determined to see it through. I have been reading it for months and have gained insight into why a previous reviewer found it such a slow read: The author violates almost every guideline for good writing, including changing points of view and introducing jarring incongruities. One can almost always tell what's to happen next because he telegraphs it well ahead of time. Punctuation is haphazard and inconsistent. I can't get into the story for tripping over bad writing, but the history he provides is worth it. Let's hope he rewrites, using a good editor and copy editor."
3,Too long & inconsistent quality,"The book is too long - over 1300 pages.I found some of the Chapters very interesting, such as the Roman-Britons, the Black Death & the Civil War, but many others just went by as a blur, seeking the next interesting bit."
4,"10,000 years held in the palms of your hand","(...)Edward Rutherfurd is a pleasure to read.I only commend this book for four stars, however, because the history of the times sometimes took backseat to the pettiness of the Wilsons vs. Shockley sub-text.Bravo Edward. But now that you've warmed up, when are you going to tackle the Americas?"
2,Get this man an editor!,"Long and dreary, wordy and blurry. Not uninteresting in parts, but in order to capture an ""epic"" scope, Rutherford relies on widely disjointed episodes, fragmented and compromised by bad fiction and worse history. Run on sentences and poor syntax are hallmarks of this books style. I finished it just because I don't like to quit. On the other hand, my wife reads all of his books. Despite this, we have a sound marriage. Even she thinks his prose is long winded and bloated, but she is a first class Anglophile, and so feels she must defend this exercise in tedium. I think it is much too long, and I like Finnegans Wake!Don't read the next sentences if you're going to read this book anyway. There is one continuing thread throughout the book. It peters out about 4/5ths of the way through. It just disappears. You follow the freakin' thing through hundreds of pages and there is no denouement. Just disappears from ken. For this alone, I hate this book."
4,Sarum,"Being a fan of sagas written in a ""Michener-esque"" style, I found this book to be a very entertaining, pleasurable read. It appeared to be well researched for the historical landscape of the region around Winchester, England.However, it also appeared that the author may have been wanting to end the novel rather quickly once the story had progressed to the 16th century, after which the story raced rather abruptly to World War II. The presence of such a gap was somewhat disappointing for a book that I otherwise could very easily given top marks."
4,A fascinating story of the development of Great Britain.,I read this novel as I was touring England for the first time and enjoyed the history even more. The stories around the families were interesting and kept my attention all the way through. I would recommend this to anyone who loves English history even though it is primarily fiction. You'll still come away with a sense of the wonder of it all.
4,A British Michener....,"Rutherfurd's Sarum, a sweeping historical perspective of the area surrounding Salisbury, England is reminiscent of James Michener's hefty, geographically-focused novels. Ending a better book than it started, Sarum begins slow, somewhat formulaic, even a bit syrupy, but as the timeline marches on Rutherfurd finds his footing.From the island's geological separation from the continent to a 1985 quest to save Salisbury's crumbling cathedral, Rutherfurd's scope is daunting, yet he pulls it off nicely without tiring the reader too much. The relationships of several local families throughout the ages provide continuity though are, at times, implausible.Although Sarum fills out it's 897 pages in an enjoyable manner, I am not rushing to consume the other Rutherfurd tomes upon my shelf. Perhaps, this is the best indicator that, while Rutherfurd is a fine author, he lacks at least one Michener quality. He isn't addictively readable. 4 stars."
4,Sweeping historical fiction as a genre,"The term ""historical fiction"" just doesn't suffice as a genre title in such cases as this. We need a more specific phrase, such as the one I've just invented, ""sweeping historical fiction,"" or SHF for short.When I recommend this book to people, I tell them, ""it starts so far back that Stonehenge isn't built until chapter 3. And it ends when Mrs Thatcher is prime minister."" If that explanation turns them off ... well, then they are SHF readers, and shouldn't try this book anyway.If that two-sentence synopsis intrigues you, then ... this is your book. Go to it!"
3,A Little Disappointing,"The author is marketed as the next James Michener, so I was expecting something of comparable quality, which this is not. The quality of the writing is a step down, being wordy, overusing passive verbs, and never really bringing the history to life. The author also did not research his subject to the extent of Michener. He has corn as being one of the first crops farmed in England. There later became corn festivals with corn princesses, and later still they worshiped a corn maiden. When Rome came to conquer the island, they saw fields of corn. And it all sounds good and well, but corn is indigenous to the Americas, it didn't make its way to Europe until after Columbus. Michener never would have made such a mistake. Let Rutherfurd be Rutherfurd, and that's fine, he's okay, but to say he is another Michener is demeaning to Michener."
2,Wanted to like this...,"I love historical fiction, especially English. Unfortunately I abandoned this book after about 150 pages. Characters were one dimensional, story bland, and writing was too simplistic for my liking. I really wanted to like this book but it's no Ken Follett novel."
3,"ambitious, expansive, yet ultimately a wee let down","Ah, to the days when publishers let you write a book longer than 384 pages!This book essentially follows five different family's for a period of 10,000 years. Each family has their own traits and talents that are passed through the generations. Rutherford sets out to create an epic masterpiece, but in rush (lol at 1000 pages!) to achieve that aim, he loses ""heart"". I did not care about these people, but was kept at a distance. The Wilsons, the Godfreys, the Masons, the Porteuses and Schockleys never really come to life for me. The five families fates and fortunate interweave from primitive man to medieval Knights and ladies, through England's blood civil war to modern man. The closer he get to modern man the more steam he seems to lose.It's rich historical chronicle, that just misses."
2,Only Fair Value,"I am using this holster with a ported 22 magnum NAA revolver. They must have someone make these for them, because it isn't the quality you would expect from NAA. The pouch is too small to actually hold any xtra catridges and the leather is thin and just feels cheap for a $30 holster. Their guns are great, and everybody makes a bad call every now and then, but unless you can't come up with something better, you may want to pass on this one.Happy Shootin."
5,"I think it's great, too.","With ""Let it Be"", ""Tim"", and this album, I think the Replacements' music was the best stuff being put out in the mid-80s. I've always tended to regard ""Pleased to Meet Me"" not as the beginning of the end, but as a more upbeat and power-pop response to the darker ""Tim"" (compare the final song on this album -- ""Can't Hardly Wait"" -- to ""Tim's"" ghostly ""Here Comes a Regular""). It was the next logical step for the band to go, and they do it brilliantly."
5,Quality pure and simple,"I have hootenanny thru this and that is the fantastic four of albums. Hey the last 2 are good too but not good as these four, I mean who cares if these guys got popular or not, they and the other ""alternative"" bands of the 80's are far superior to the 90's bands (ps the grunge bands started in the 80's too) so to make a long story short the placemats rock so buy em, i mean they are better than the goo goo dolls don't ya think??????"
4,"Pleased to meet them, yes","I am not a critic, so to speak. I am an individual who loves a variety of music genres.I happen to really enjoy listening the the Replacements. Every now and again the channelI am streaming plays a Replacements song and it never fails to shock me. I typically dropeverything I am doing to give it a good listen and truly appreciate it. This album was thefirst album I purchased when I was first introduced to Paul Westerberg and his way with words.Alex Chilton, Nightclub jitters, Skyway ... these three always stop me in my tracks. Theyare timeless and replay with, seemingly, the same energy one would have found in the studiowith these guys ... maybe? One can hope.Brilliantly executed tunes + thought provoking lyrics = bliss."
4,Pleased to meet them.,"I'm not sure if this is ""The Replacements"" best album, but it might be. Front to back it's very good. This does include the well known songs ""Alex Chilton"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait"", but ""I.O.U."", ""I Don't Know"" and ""Skyway"" are all great too. My only complaint is that the cd needs remastering bad. ""The Replacements"" never found huge success, and might not have wanted it, but they've influenced countless bands for sure. Any album of theirs is good, as is the collection ""All For Nothing/Nothing For All"", but I think you'd be pleased with ""Pleased To Meet Me""."
3,Can't be angry when you're pleased,"Can't be brilliant either. The angry genuis of Westerberg exited stage left with Bob Stinson, never to return. Pleased to Meet Me fails to match the sonic perfection that is Tim and Let it Be (the Mats albums you need before this one). But none of this is Paul's fault. Witness the similar demise of the Clash, the Who and Pearl Jam. Start out hungry, young and pissed and the Bastard Muse of Young plays through you. Go on tour, get fat and old, and the Muse leaves you for Limp Bizkit. You can only rage against the machine for so long. I'm just glad I paid a single dollar to see them rage in 1982 in Florida State's campus cafeteria. They created a pyramid of empty beer bottles, played for a frenzied hour building to sloppy reditions of We're Off to See the Wizard and the Green Acres theme before they stumbled off the stage. It was good, angry, drunk fun. Too bad that kind of thing can't last forever. All over but the shouting..."
2,First post-Bob Stinson Replacements album is missing magic,"Pleased to Meet Me has several strong songs on it, but it's also the first post-Bob Stinson Replacements record and as anyone familiar with the level of dysfunction and anarchy that Bob (god rest his soul) brought to the band will tell you, especially anyone who caught 'em live circa '84 -85, it takes more than Paul's great vocals and songwriting skills to make a great Replacements record. Compared to Tim or Let it Be, let's face it, two of the greatest rock records of all time, Pleased to Meet Me sounds pretty hollow, overproduced and mechanical. The drumming is absolutely soulless, Tommy remembers all his bass lines, and Bob's guitar wails are replaced with session-man riffs that smack of too much rehearsal and not enough release. ""Valentine,"" ""Skyway,"" and ""Nightclub Jitters"" are great songs but overall it's the beginning of the end for Westerberg and company."
3,waste water treatment agent,I haven't read your book. How can I get a brief review on the contents of the book?
1,AMAZON.COM REALLY SCREWED UP,"I thought this would make a nice Christmas gift so I purchased 3 of them several weeks before Christmas. The stock available showed 5 at the time. A week before Christmas, I received a email from Amazon saying the item was back-ordered. Called their support and found out that the items ""should"" be there by Christmas. Although I panicked through the week, I eventually received all 3 on Christmas eve. But the situation got even worse, it turns out that they sent me the cheaper gift set with the aluminum box and not the wooden one. Called their support back and they said that they had no more of the wooden gift boxes left so they sent the aluminum ones. Since these arrived at 6 p.m. on Christmas eve with no time to go out and find some different gifts to give, I had to keep the 3 screwed up sets that Amazon sent. Thanks again Amazon for making this holiday one of the worst for me."
3,CD Lens Cleaner,"Hard to tell how well it worked. Can't say that I really noticed any difference. I've had theses CD players for several years and this is the first time they have been cleaned so I thought (hoped) that there would be an improvement in sound. Some discs still skip and there is no noticeable scratch, some simply no longer play or stop playing at some point and the discs end abruptly.It did arrive promptly and in good condition."
5,Worth plugging in the VCR 12 years later,"This video was released in '95 and even 12 years later it's worth getting out your old VCR for a watch. I caught ""Tank Girl"" on TV yesterday and heard the same song thats played in Jeremy Mcgrath's incredible opening segment, so I came home and spent an hour digging for my old VHS tapes and hooking up the VCR just for those first few minutes of motocross bliss. While I don't enjoy the rest of the video as much, its still worth owning and watching even if just for the nostalgia of the good old days when Mcgrath was king riding atop the Honda CR Steed."
2,A half-hour's worth of groan inducing one-liners...,"I've seen Jonathan Katz interviewed on TV, and he is really really funny. Unfortunately, this book offers more ""guffaws"" than real laughter. The to-do lists have a *high* groan factor, such as these gems: Jim Henson: Try talking without socks on my hands; Norman Rockwell: Submit painting of severed head to ""Saturday Evening Post,"" just to see their reaction; or Dwight Einsenhower: Rework ""I'm Fond of Ike"" campaign slogan. I bought this as a bathroom book that we could read for a while, and I read the whole thing in less than half an hour. Kind of a drag, I was expecting much more from him. I guess this could be a good $10 office grab bag gift, but that's about it."
1,disappointing product,"The glug glug noise is very noticeable and kept me up at night.The water containers are somewhat opaque and don't let you seethe water level very well. As other reviewers have noticed,the opening is not very big, so it takes a while to fill upthe containers.Worst of all, after I turned it on, my eyes and throat startedto get really irritated. After one day of that, I had to giveup and return it...."
1,Defective,"I have recently received the product and haven't enjoyed it being on for more than 30 seconds. The fan stops 30 seconds after I turn it on, and turning either knob will not make it come back on. The main thing I want to emphasize is the customer service of the company. I called their 800 number, hoping I can talk to someone who can help me troubleshoot the problem. I got an old-fashioned residential answering machine that tells me they will return my call in few days! I don't know if those people who have written those wonderful reviews about the product have been paid by the company or not. Maybe they have. Maybe this could be a good product if the fan worked and you wouldn't need to call their customer service. I am not sure If I could ever trust shopping online again, unless there is a place locally that I could take the product for service. Can Amazon or anyone tell me how I can have this product serviced?ThanksFrank Sadigh"
2,COLD AIR >>>> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.....,"After a LONG search, I finally decided to buy this one. I was really excited and set it up the first day when I got it. However, it produces VERY COLD air - my apartment is COLD and WET every night when I go to bed. I don't know it's an individual issue with my machine or it's the same for others. I just don't understand all these wonderful reviews. I wish mine could do the wonder too... I tried different settings and already gave it enough time... I will return it tomorrow because it's just too cold for Chicago's winter."
2,Drums in the Bedroom,"This was a great disappointment. After reading reviews of other Vornado models and complaints about the loud knocking that periodically comes from air entering the water tanks, I decided to discount these complaints. After all, this is a new model and it is advertised as ""bedroom quiet"". I figured that the manufacturer had solved the problem. Wrong! The humidifier fan is actually very quiet but loud knocking woke us up repeatedly during the night. I would give this humidifier the highest 5-star rating for its use as a humidifier. However, since we cannot use it at night in the bedroom, its use is limited. We try to keep it on during the day and turn it off at bedtime. This is, otherwise, a first class humidifier. Why can't Vornado solve this problem?"
2,Interesting? Yes. Listenable? No.,"If the idea of a German former architect (student) making a mostly empty vinyl LP and then scratching it with razor blades to give it regular beats in the form of crackles and pops appeals to you, then give it a try. However, if you want something MUCH more interesting in this ""glitch"" hyper-minimalist sub-genre get the uber brilliant ""mp92"" from SND. Thomas Brinkmann has become a bore. He ends the album with the usual pops + someone in an American accent saying ""Berlin"" endlessly. Self-parody is passe and so is Brinkmann."
4,The Multihull Bible,"Frankly, this is the only book that covers all the currently available (as of publication date) cruising multihulls. Including production boats, semi-custom and stock designs. If you think you might be interested in a multihull for your next boat this is THE book to start with period. I found this book invaluable in sorting through the bewildering array of multihull boats and builders out there. Whenever a broker or ad had a Super Duper XYZ I was able to look in this book and figure out what it was or make a pretty good guess based on the current XYZ version. Would I buy again? Absolutely!"
3,Not Bad...,"I probably wont get it again, but it was a good ""everyday"" cologne to use after showering.Not what I would use if I wanted to feel like I was going to a special even - in other words, nothing special.Definitely a different scent, unusual, just not something that turned me on primitively."
5,I love this thermostaat,"This thermostat is easy to use. I have another just like it. It was easy to wire in, is easy to program, easy to change the program to Hold. I love waking up to a warm house!"
4,Best Thermostat for 120V systems,This Product does the Job very well for those heating systems that use a 120V. This Product has all the features of the more expensive items and is worth more then many other competing products.
4,"It does have it's drawbacks, but . . . . .","It does have it's drawbacks, but all in all, I am glad that I purchased it. The main drawbacks are that the display lettering is small, and there is no backlight. I keep a little LED keychain light nearby to see the display when it's darker in the room.Programing it is easy, and the overide function is quick and accessible."
4,works very well; lowest temp = 45,"I shopped around a lot before settling on this unit as the most features for the price. It works VERY well, much better control than the cheap non-digital units. I use it with an in-wall fan-type heater. It works with any in-line heater,not just baseboard.ProsEasy to install and setup.Plenty flexible enough (4 daily time settings & weekday vs. weekend.Accurate: keeps temperature very well.ConsA very minor drawback is that it bottoms out at 45. This is for a mud-room in the garage, which we would prefer to keep closer to 35-40 at night in the dead of winter.There is no simple ""off"" button either, which would be useful."
3,a couple of concerns,"The item looked fine.There are a couple of things you need to consider. This product is rated for 15 Amps maximum and my baseboard heater runs at 21 Amps.Also, when I opened up current thermostat, there was no easy way to figure out which wire (both the same color) was the one that went to the box and the one that went to the heater. When I used a current checker I had to put one end into a ground (bathroom outlet next to the thermostat) and the end on to each wire to find the hot wire. Not sure if this is the correct way to determine it, but that was all I could come up with.I would have loved to use this item, and they should report the amps. I know it doesn't make sense to write a review on something I didn't try, but think about the hassle and money I saved you when I was out the restocking fee."
5,money saver,"We looked all over until we found this, since we wanted to regulate a space heater at the 120 v. level. We had never done aluminum hard wiring before and burned out the nuts the first try. Our local hardware store guru clued us into using the special aluminum paste which we did and we are now sitting comfortable and with a lot better electric bill. Don't let hard wiring scare you off."
4,Armed and Dangerous,"I ordered this CD because of the title track from the movie, ""Armed and Dangerous."" I like it because of the brass work, Atlantic Starr voices and the energy and pace of the song. It represents an era of R&B music that I wish was not in the past."
3,An opinion from a college student majoring in special ed.,"I read this book as part of a project for a class relating to my major. The assignment was to read a book that could be used as a resource for parents with a child with a disability. One of the things we had to consider was the reading level of the book. While the book was enjoyable and helpful to me as a future educator, I am not sure I could recommend it to just any parent. It was full of technical jargon that, had I not had any classes in this stuff, I would have had no clue what half of it meant. With that said, though, it was a very detailed account of what parents must go through when their child is labeled with having a disability...something I need to think about as I persue my career. I would recommend it to many of the other students I attend classes with."
2,Let Me Hear Your Voice,This book is too biased and giving false hopes to desperate parents of children with ASDI have a big question to the author.Where are her children now?Show the evidence they truely recovered.
3,Interesting Book,"It was an interesting book, but the author wants to sell the idea that ABA is the best and only approach to autism dismissing other choices like DIR/ Floortime, which in fact has proven to be more helpful in kids with PDD. Read Engaging Autism by Dr. Greenspan. Living with autism is more than just drills."
3,Offers hope,"I found this book gave me much hope for what would otherwise have been a very devastating diagnosis for my 3 yr old son. I only wish the drills were described in more detail and that there was less religion and preaching. A good first read, but very sentimental and at times condescending."
5,Let me hear your voice,As a mom with child that was just diagnosed I had no idea what I was looking at. This mother wrote everything I was feeling and thinking. Now I know not only am I not alone but I am not crazy.
5,great portrayel of autism and its treatment,I am entereing a Masters of Occupational Therapy program this fall. I read this book over the summer in hopes of having a better picture of Autism and of ABA therapy. This book gave me just that. ABA jobs are common here and I know that they can help a student. Intervention (especially early on) can change the life of any child with disabilities. This book shows how much it can change the life of a child with Autism.
4,great service,I found this book very interesting. It gave me a lot of information about autism treatments. Good resource for parents with autistic children.
5,Awesome!!!,"I read this book shortly after our twins were diagnosed with autism. I could not put the book down and finished rather quickly. This book encourages you, as the reader and as the caregiver, to look into Applied Behavior Analysis. ABA is a scientific method used in teaching children with autism. ABA is not for every child on the spectrum. However, it clearly helped Catherine's child. This is a book about courage and the need to NEVER give up on one's dream for their child. I LOVE this book and it will be in my autism library for years to come."
4,Beautiful and heart-warming,"I read this book sometime in the early 90's and although I can't recall the fine details of the book, I remember it as an excellent and inspiring book. Reading about the author's struggles and her children's recovery helped determine my career path and I've now have one more year to go before graduating as a speech therapist. It's wonderful to know what hope, patience and determination can amount to and the ways I can help make a difference in someone's life, however much / little that may be. Thank you for sharing, Catherine. God Bless."
5,The best autobiographical book on autism available today.,"Catherine Maurice does for children with autism what Marie Killallea did for children with cerebral palsy decades ago: She teaches us that these kids can be treated, and she tells how they should be treated. Thanks to this book, more and more parents will seek and demand effective help for their autistic children."
5,"detailed, creative and easy to follow directions","I have stocked my shelves for any catastrophe that might come our way. I knew our family would not starve but was beginning to be concerned about how I was going to put together easy and tasty meals from a can. How was I going to bake or cook them, too? The Reid's book has taken the guesswork out of the mealplanning. What a much needed book in these times we may face! I have made the oven box following the simple instructions - you are a genius, Chuck! We had a great time doing it, too. My kids are amazed that we can bake a meal - if we have to- in a cardborad box!"
5,"An easy reading, practical disaster food planning guide","We have this book and have read it and used it. It is an easy reading and practical book that gets you ready for disaster situations. After having our home severely damaged in two California earthquakes, we appreciate the step-by-step instructions on setting up a disaster food pantry with nutritious foods we can use (not camping freeze dried fare) and can rotate through our normal food planning. And you get the recipes for using the food to boot! We also made our cardboard oven and cooked in it, and it works! It's a great family project and will put your kids at ease knowing you are good scouts and well prepared!"
2,Grossly overpriced!,"The information in the book is typical - nothing new - You can get other books for one-fourth of the price. May I recommend, ""Roughing it Easy"",""Cooking with Home Storage"", or any Amish cookbook? There are a lot of books with more information out there. If this book were less expensive, I would not have expected so much. Very disappointing! I would never recommend it."
5,stunningly good,"This album is magic. There's this amazing lushness to it that grabs my attention and stokes those musical pleasure centers in my brain. Jessamine, with this album(and others), explores many different musical terrain balancing elements including pop, noise, ambient/drone with beautiful, dark tonal qualities. If you like this Jessamine, be sure to check out Fontanelle. After Jessamine broke up, some of the members joined with a bunch others to form this even more progressive and experimental group with 3 albums so far."
4,"Beautiful Setting, Wonderful Story","I really enjoyed reading this book. It had a redemptive thread running through, but wasn't an ""in your face"" religious story.I became attached to all of the characters and look forward to reading the rest of the series to see what's in store for some of my favorite people."
2,A Rush Of Wings,"I was blown away by Heitzmann's book ""Halos"" and had high expectations for this one as well. Unfortunately I found it predictable and disappointing. For as much as I enjoyed Heitzmann's other work, I will still keep giving her books a chance in hopes of discovering another that impresses and moves me as ""Halos"" did."
3,Not her best effort,"This is the 6th book I've read by Ms. Heitzman. I'm continually drawn to her books because her characters are truly human - with flaws like everyone else. But although this one is good, it didn't live up to some of the others. I found portions to be a little slow, and I found it hard to believe that Rick (with his strong Christian lifestyle) would turn to someone who didn't share his faith and showed no interest in learning more. But like I said, her characters have flaws like everyone else! Not a bad book, but don't let this one turn you off."
3,"Good storyline, but lacking spiritual depth","I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book but found it lacking in spiritual depth. I never truly got the sense that I was reading a novel that had a Christ-centered message. I believe this story would have had more value to it's readers if the Christian character, Rick, would have had a bigger part to play in the lives of the other characters. It was a good storyline full of intrigue, suspense, and a growing love between a man and a woman but left alot to be desired when it came to a true message of Godly hope and what it means to be a Christian in the world today. It is a clean read for those of us who find that neccessary."
2,A complex story,"This is a complex story about a woman with various episodes in her past that have affected her present life. When she runs from said problems she meets two men she likes and both of them want to be with her. I didn't care for this story for various reasons. Rick has this supposed strong faith and then decides to ask Noelle to marry him after a few weeks together knowing she is not a Christian and has no desire to be. He thinks he can 'fix' her. Then when she leaves, he gives up his faith and everything and Morgan is the one that saves her and she responds to his kisses as well??? I do not feel any love or connection between Noelle and Rick....she's basically using him and I had a nasty taste in my mouth throughout this whole book."
5,A Rush of Wings by Kristen Heitzmann,"I loved this book--the characters, the story, and the fact that Heitzmann moves and grows the characters in a Biblical way. Although all of her books are a good mix of suspense, romance, and Christian growth, this showed more real growth in the hero. There were a few areas that could have been developed more--the beginning seemed a little slow, the hero at first is too chaste for a man, and (spoiler alert here--but nothing readers won't have figured out) the heroine's conversion--when it finally comes--a little too easy. These 3 things aside, I thoroughly enjoyed the story and characters. It's a series, and if you love that, I'm sure the others will be just as good."
4,A Good Book the 2nd time around!!,"I began reading this book and got a strange sense of déjà vu. The further I got into the book, the more I knew what would happen. Was the book predictable?!? No I have read it before. But I remember the first time that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I enjoyed just as much the second time through. I would recommend this book to others.Noelle St. Claire is fleeing from her own fears. She leaves her wealthy upbringing and finds herself on a horse ranch owned by Rick Spencer. Along with Rick at the ranch is Morgan (his brother). As one brother tries to win her love (at the beginning) the other sits back and wonders about her secrets. She longs to be free of her fear. One of the brothers helps her to conquer her fear.I received a free copy of this book from Bethany House Publishing Company for the purpose of reviewing."
4,"wonderful, introspective book!","I normally read strait romance, but picked this one up on a whim. I loved the setting, in-depth character development, and especially, both male leads! Frankly, I've been getting a little tired of standard romance novels that are cluttered down with serial killers or suspense plots; or chick-lit that lacks any depth or emotional pull. This was a very refreshing change of pace. I loved watching the story unfold, and thought Rick was a great, great hero. He was gentle, but no push-over. That can be hard to write, but the author did a super job with it.Here is why I didn't give it 5 stars: I didn't really see why both men were so bonkers over Noelle. Sure, she was pretty, and had this Victim-in-Need-of-a-Hero thing going for her. But I wanted her to be more worthy somehow.... I just didn't feel she was all that compelling. Now Morgan was VERY compelling, and I've just placed an order for the book about him....that is going to be one interesting read, I think!"
5,couldn't put it down,"I have to agree with other reviews that say some of the Christian romance/suspense is lacking. This is not one of them. The characters were real people, flaws and all. Great plot. I bought the second book in the series as soon as I finished this one."
5,Robin's nest,"This product works unbelievably! Just look at the incredible ingredients! For anyone that rated this product low because they did not like the taste...well...I have the perfect way to fix it...Skip mixing it with water and try what I stumbled upon. Santa Cruz organic apricot nectar. I found it at Kroger and its often on sale for about $2.60 a bottle (in the organic section). When mixed with Super Seed it actually tastes like I am drinking an apple or peach pie...not only is it tolerable...its delicious! Yes...its a bit gritty...just add more juice or a little water with the juice. I brought it in to my work and gave out samples to prove how great it was...they were all stunned and loved it. Maybe someday I will add some plain frozen yogurt with the apricot nectar so I can have some ice cream with my pie!Santa Cruz Juice, Apricot Nectar (95% Organic), 32-Ounce (Pack of 12)"
5,Great Product,I needed to add a little more fiber to my diet and this product does just that! Plus it taste great as it has cinnamon in it and I have mixed it with Syntha-6 for more fiber and it taste amazing! Yes it is a little gritty but as long as you shake it up well all is good. Highly impressed as I will be buying this on a regular basis
5,Great Gluten-Free Fiber Supplement,"Unlike some of the other fiber supplements that say they are gluten free (but contain barley leaf, etc), this product really is gluten free, it tastes pretty good (as far as fiber supplements go), and it is effective and affordable. I love it enough that I signed up for monthly shipment. Try it - you may really like it!"
2,Strange chemical odor,"I was very happy with this product the first few orders, but then I noticed a strange chemical smell with my last two orders. It definately does not smell natural. The taste is not the same as well. It seems the company has altered the recipe in some way. I will give it one more try after this, but if the same, will stop using. Why would they mess with what was such a great product?"
2,Delicious but gassy,"I tried this product, and its at a great price so no problems there. Also, I like the flavor and dont mind the consistency it creates when mixed with your beverage of choice. My only complaint is the horrendous, noxious gas that it creates....and I dont mean from one use, I have taken all but two servings, one serving a day for a month. I thought it was something else causing the gas at first, and then I thought my body would get used to it, but I finally decided I would stop taking it and maintain my other supplements....this was the only thing I dropped from my morning routine and the gas went away that day. So its pretty clear to me at least that I react this way to this supplement. I have had other fiber supplements without this effect. I also noticed a little constipation, even with increased fluid intake.....so all in all delicious but gassy."
1,EW,"This is NOT very tasty when mixed with water. I can only see using this when baking like muffins or something. The fiber smells like a mix of spices kind of. I have only used this once and it will probably go to waste because I really just don't think its very practical. Im still trying to understand why this has so many 5 star reviews. It is a quality product but its just not for me I guess.Ok i had previously given it 2 stars and just tried drinking this with milk. and... it was even worse than with water. I was gagging the last bit down. I have NO idea how anyone gave this more than 2 stars. I mean It was like drinking chunky milk. It mixes horribly too.My suggestion- don't buy the bigger container if you've never tried it. I regret doing it... what will I do with all this fiber??????Im now using Swanson's Tri-Fiber. For the people who have tried this and dont really care for it, I would recommended that. Its much better taking it in a capsule form."
5,Works great!,"My pregnant wife was having constipation problems. On 2nd day and scoop, everything was flowing fine. Now she takes it once or twice a week and haven't had any issues yet for a couple of months now. I take it once in a while when things aren't flowing well, and it works great too. Taste good with protein shake to boot, great product!"
5,I am shocked,"I was so shocked at how good this tasted. By the sounds of the label it wouldnt be nearly as good. Great Fiber, Easy to mix in a smoothie."
5,"great product, preat service","I always receive on time. Compared to local stores, the price for this product is very good. Buying through subscription with this vendor is definitely the way to go. Highly recommended."
2,Messy and not effective,"This product was really messy and got everywhere. It also didn't work for me, but I know everyone reacts differently."
4,Good overall,"The taste is good. I usually drink it with just water, it is slightly sweet but mostly watery. Mixing with flavored drinks works well and doesn't change the taste too much. The consistency is rough, it feels like you're drinking sand and some of the granules linger in your throat and mouth, I usually have to rinse it down with water afterwards. It doesn't stay mixed with liquid so you either have to chug it after stirring or keep the spoon around to stir again before each sip. It seems to work well, as good or better than other fiber supplements, includes probiotics, and all natural."
2,Excellent in theory,"On paper, this looks like a perfect product. It gives you a ton of fiber from varied natural sources. However, I just can't stand the taste. I bought it to put in my morning oatmeal, but I find myself choking back half a bowl and throwing the rest out. I'll try baking very small quantities in bread until I run out so I don't have to taste it, but also don't waste.Its definitely worth a try to see if you like it, although as another reviewer said, it is expensive for the amount of fiber. I would argue its worth it to pay more for real food, but I have to stick with plain ground up flax and oatmeal for now."
2,Clumpy and hard to drink,"First I must admit this product smells excellent! You would think it would taste good, but it definitely did not. The weird clumpy concoction it made in water was definitely the biggest turn-off. I was impressed with getting fiber from food sources rather than synthetically like the Bebefiber that I normally use, but that product is just so much easier. You can mix it with anything. Also, there are 80 calories in each scoop of Super Seed which is not great if you're used to the 20 calories from Benefiber. This product is extremely well rated by everyone else, so I would give it a try and see if you like it for yourself. If it is your cup of tea, I'm positive there is nothing more healthy that you could be drinking. I'm definitely disappointed that I didn't like it."
3,Not Much Fiber,"It does taste good and mixes well with water and in my protein drinks, but only 6 grams of fiber per scoop(30 per container). The cost to fiber ratio really is not that good! A box of Fiber One cereal has more fiber than an entire tub of Super Seed. Unless this has other benefits that Fiber One doesn't, this will be my first and last tub of this stuff. A 16oz bag of black beans has 200 grams of fiber and 100 grams of protein for $1.40. A box of Fiber One cereal has 200 grams of fiber for $4 - $5. This stuff is way overpriced unless it has other major health benefits that the others do not. Hope this helps..."
2,Strange Chemical Taste and Smell,"I've used this product for about a year, and prior to receiving my last order, have been very happy with it. With this latest shipment, I've noticed an over-powering chemical smell and taste in the product. Amazon has been great in replacing the item, but the same thing, although to a much lesser extent, was found in the new batch (different batch number). I've contacted Garden of Life, but of course they state nothing is wrong on their end. Not sure if it's the way Amazon is storing the product or if it's a problem with manufacturing, but clearly this is not how the product should be."
3,High quality ingredients but not the effect I expected,"I purchased this because I had been taking Metamucil every day and wanted a more natural fiber laxative. This product has very high quality ingredients, so I had high expectations. When mixed with water, this dissolves well, but has a sandy texture. Also, this really did not have the same effect as taking Metamucil at night. I ended up buying a more natural psyllium product. I still plan to use this but am not sure how to incorporate into my diet. I would recommend this if you want to include more fiber in general in your diet, but not if you want to take a fiber laxative at night and get up in the morning and cleanse your system."
4,"Good product, with bearable taste","When mixed with water, this product is tough to drink. Mixing it with milk works best. It doesn't mix very well and has almost a nutty taste to it. Great ingredients however and the fiber helps keep me regular."
1,ok initially,"The product was tolerable initially. However, after using it a few weeks, I could not tolerate it. Just the smell of it was sickening."
3,Tastes bad,Now that I am on a raw food diet I don't need this and good thing too cause it tastes really bad. I thought I would add it to my green smoothie drink in the morning - BLYACH...thick and yuk it made my poor red apple spinach smoothie.
5,Best fiber anywhere,I have been using this product for about 4 years now. I have tried others and I always come back to this one. I love the taste and how it works :)
3,I bought it is a back up,"A good blade, I bought it as a back up, so I'd have an extra kicking about. It's inexpensive when compared to my other bandsaw blades. However I have owned other Olson blades and have found them good for their price in the past."
1,I garantee you'll love this book,I enjoyed this book because I have many common thinga with Pocahontas.For exaple she has an older brother and so do I. I garantee you'll love this book as much as I did .
4,Learning Adobe FrameMaker lacks three vital tools.,"Learning Adobe FrameMaker lacks three tools that are vital for any beginning writer at my company, which generates thousands of books a year. The missing pieces are: multifile books, indexes, and cross-references. These oversights force me as an instructor to generate my own materials, but as the sole trainer, I have little time for instructional design. I almost discounted purchasing the book for that reason, but the low cost per student convinced me to hang on and fill in the gaps myself. I'm anxious for the so-called ""advanced"" material--stuff everybody needs from day 1 to work for us!"
2,DONT BUY THIS ITEM FROM CONFILE,"I ordered this item from seller confile and from the first time I used it, it would light up a 13 watt light bulb or anything. I dont know if it is just the item it self but it is a non work item for sure if you order from confile from KY. I was even lucky to get the green light on the device to work. so in the end i did get some money back but I was out $17.35 for shipping it back I thought i was shipping to Germany or something it has become costly to ship i should have asked for the money from confile before I shipped it. I just get tiered of dishonest people who pretty much say something works when they really dont work. honesty is the best way to go."
2,Turn around time to receive item,The book is OK.The time to order and receive the book was too longThree weeks is too long to wait.I have since dropped the class that I bought the book for.The book like the Instructor was very labor intensive.
2,Not for Consumer Camcorders,"The first few pages have many good points for the consumer video shooter, but the bulk of the book is aimed at professionals or very wealthy and very serious amateurs.The author purports to speak to the amateur and does so in the first 96 pages. The remaining 170 some pages gets into equipment and the author covers only the best professional-level gear. If you don't mind being told that you can't possibly make videos unless you purchase a $5000 camcorder, $3000 in tripods, $8000 in lighting, etc, then you might like the book. If you don't mind being talked down to and you are willing to equip yourself with two truckloads of gear at a cost that is many times the price of your camcorder, then you might like this book.Try to find a used copy without the CD - it adds nothing that is not in the book."
1,Not for beginers..,"If you are trying, as I am, to buy a good self learning book in order to become be a good amateur video shooter, this is not such book. I suppose this book is oriented to professionals. Even the English level is too high and at moments looks as poetic language. The book is well printed and has nice pictures, but it will be for ever in my book shelf."
4,A great help for a novice.,"very good for me, the novice looking to become an 'intermediate' shooter. well done."
2,Not helpful for a non-professional,"Wow, I don't understand all the 5 star reviews. I was trying to find a book that would help me shoot better home videos. This is not it. I'm not a beginner as I try to tell stories with my videos. But to me, this book would only be useful to a film student. And even then, I just don't see that much extra value it adds. I'm mad at myself for reading the whole book instead of cutting my losses. But I kept hoping it was going to get better."
2,From Back Cover,"Though Hope LeClaire's memory was in shards, in the arms of her gallant rescuer, Matt McCarlson, she felt entirely whole. Stranded on his ranch, they couldn't summon her past, so they focused on the present...and the sensual awareness sizzling between them. Then a torrent of memories came flooding in...and the ""forever"" she dreamed of was washed away. For Hope was a Stockwell, an heiress of untold wealth, and Matt was the sworn enemy of all aristocratic women. But Hope would not be denied her one chance at happiness...at becoming this proud rancher's wife..."
3,Great Book,Dr. Weiner's book is a another good reference book. I am happy and glad to find another one of his books.
4,Comprehensive!,"Before Dr. Weiner-Savage, my water magic left a lot to be desired and my son (he's one of those kids that pretends to have autism - the good doctor assured me there was no such thing) wouldn't respond to my beatings and/or herbal brainwashing medicines. But now I know exactly what placebo to give him when his thetan level gets out of control. Thanks Dr. Weiner!"
2,The Last Kingpriest,This book tells the story of the last Kingpriest of Istar which means it had to contradict every other book in the entire series. It drove me crazy so I couldn't finish it.
2,Classic Science Fiction stuff,"To those who loves Classic Science Fiction films from the 60's, you are infor a treat. This cheapo production still delivers as we have situationshappening in a spaceship and then on to a uncharted planet. There are creatures and martians and some descent cave scenes...but because the production possibly had a small budget....it shows. They used to show this movie late at night and now its part of my collection. If you dontexpect too much, you should enjoy this little flick that is sold at a great price. I only gave it 2 stars cause the female astronauts voice dubbing is the worse ive seen..."
4,Boston Globe rules OK,"Christina Robb has achieved an easily assimilable description of the relational approach taken by the many women practitioners of academic psychology and psychtherapy who refused to accept the standard male-led, soulless,rigid technologies and thinking of the late 1970s and early 80s. That changes were needed to paychology's paradigms was first proposed by Carol Gilligan a student of the renowned moral rsearcher Lawrence Kohlberg. She and subsequent small informal groups of women extended the world's knowledge and understanding of difference and undercut the assumption that women's moral reasoning was inferior to that of men. It wasn't , it was different - not worse, just different. Thanks Christina Robb for explaining the history and development of revolutionary psychological thinking. Which raises the question. What action resulted?"
1,IGNORE THIS BOOK!!,Here is my answer to Susan Jeffers book...If your foolish enough to think raisingkids are easy buy a dog not this book!
4,A stunningly honest portrayal of parenthood,"Susan Jeffers wrote ""I'm Okay, You're A Brat"" when her own grown children and stepchildren got married and began to contemplate parenthood. Unlike most wannabe-grandmas, Jeffers wanted her kids to know how HARD, HARD, HARD it is raising children. Whether they are babies, pre-schoolers, big kids or (gasp) teenagers, the relationship is always give-and-take: Parents give and children take. Jeffers also spends a lot of time discussing how children can wreak havoc on a marriage.In other books and media, so much discussion of parenthood and childhood is treated with kid gloves. This book gets down and dirty. I gave it to my sister just after her wedding, so if she and her husband decide to have kids, they will do it with their eyes open."
5,Please make this book into a Kindle book.,"I've read the book and listened to the abridged audio. The audio never tells that some full grown children after age 21 commit suicide. This is a small percentage. Life is not easy for the parent or child of any age. I am glad to see a woman who has the guts to till the world that child raising is not easy. It is frustrating for the child and adult. I am a single man destined to live out his life childless (sorry, no child boarders for me). On the bus I think it is rude if a mother cannot control her child's crying. Maybe some of this woman's philosophy will sink in and that their might be fewer pregnant women walking about. If I had a car my sign would read ""I don't care if you got a child in your car ever."" in response to those signs I see in other cars that say. ""baby on board."" Thank you Susan Jeffers. I toast myself to a very long childless life."
3,Somewhat helpful,"The book provides some relief for parents with built-in sense of guilt, but other than that does not give you any insights about children, only tells you to not take them that seriously. Somewhat helpful, but not a book that stays with you."
2,not for me,too much shooting and clearing the table and not enough direction on the shot making. pretty disappointed. I bought all 3 dvd's unfortunately and they are all the same.
3,Good but not great.,This movie tried really hard to be funny. And I give the directors credit for trying really hard. This movie is packed with one-liners and absurd sub-plots. This movie tries hard to be a good spoof like Airplane! and The Naked Gun. And in a lot of ways it succeeds. The stand out character is the dance instructor who has a very bad case of camel toe. And at the end of the movie she beat-boxes in a very absurd way. One of the characters is a gay guy that actually has a dance and song number. If you want a few laughs then check this out. Grade: B
1,Disgusted.,"The Wayans family has never been funny and never will be. The only reason I even attempted to watch this p.o.s. is because it was on TV. Avoid this movie unless you enjoy mind-numbingly predictable third grade bathroom humor, low-budget CGI, and homophobic stabs. Everything about this movie will either make you ill or wanna punch something."
1,i hate this movie it stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this spoof movie stinks and its not funny at all its totally lame and the jokes are not even funny this movie should have got a direct to video release thats how lame this movie is its on par with other lame spoof/parody films that are not even fun like example meet the spartans and epic movie save your money and buy something else instead of this lame movie
2,BOOORING,"Save your money! This movie stinks! My girlfriend loves watching dance movies like Step Up, Stomp the Yard etc so I thought we would love this movie. The film spoofs all the popular teen dance movies in typical Wayans Brothers fashion, but falls way short of their previous work. I have seen all of the ""Scary Movie"" spoofs and thought this would be just as funny, boy was I wrong. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
3,Dance Flick,"dance flick es una parodia sobre las peliculas que tienen una tema de bailar. se burla de tales como: you got served, stomp the yard, stand and deliver, y mas. en esta pelicula hay unas bromas graciosas y unas no. habia momentos cuando yo me reia mucho, y habia momentos que subia la ceja. la mejor cosa de este pelicula es que estaban los hermanos wayans. ellos pueden hacer cualquier cosa graciosa. en fin no era una pelicula tan mal, pero no la mejor tampoco. si a usted le gusta las parodias. entonces esta pelicula es una buena para su coleccion."
2,Just a bad movie!,I can keep this review simply by saying this movie was very bad! Low brow and not in a good way. Watching this one can easily understand why the scary movie franchise only became funny when the Wayans brothers left and the Zuckers took over!
1,New travel regulations make this useless.....,"Due to the requirement of having one's luggage available at all times for inspection, even after checking it in, this item is now not of use since it locks. If your bag were chosen for inspection once you were separated from it, the strap would be merely cut off and a sticker placed on the bag explaining what had happened for you to find when you were reunited with the bag. The strap, once a great idea, has become a travel dinosaur of the past, doomed for extinction."
4,A Knight in Waiting by Juliet Landon (Large Print Mills & Boon Legacy of Love Historical Romance Hardcover),"Description from the book back cover:North Yorkshire, 1350's: Lady Aletta Markenfield relished the freedom of widowhood. It was a grief to her that she had proven to be barren, but otherwise she could not regret the death of her brutal husband. The arrival of new neighbour Sir Geraunt de Paine overturned all her pleasure - the laxity in the wake of the Black Death meant that some of Sir Geraunt's serfs had moved to her estate, and Geraunt had no hesitation about using blackmail! Aletta was faced with equally upsetting choices - disrupt the fledgling families or become Geraunt's mistress. Disguising the fact with a betrothal ring was small comfort ..."
1,CODE NAME WILD GEESE,"The film is a very average movie and the print is definitely NOT A DVD PRINT. Amazon has recorded it, on a disc, from a VHS TAPE (inferior quality) and are selling it as a new DVD item. Do not go for it and do not spend/waste money on this one."
1,"Very bad,,,","POOR PRINT...Don't waste your time. Sorry I purchased it. Stick to the original ""Wild Geese"". Better actors & better production.These folks should be ashamed to offer this for sale!!! From Lakewood, Colorado"
3,Great ending!,"I won't spoil it for everyone else, but the ending was definitely not what I expected. I give an extra star for that. Robin Tunney is my favorite actor, so I need to give three stars for that reason!!"
2,Not great exfoliation,"Smooth and don't exfoliate well. I did pick the cheapest gloves on amazon, so I shouldn't be that surprised. But they fell almost silky on my skin."
2,small,I found these gloves to be affordable but had extreme difficulty getting them on my hands. I have arthritis but still found them to be too short from finger tip to wrist.
5,former love,I grew up in the 50`s and experienced Wallnetoes. Searched for years to find them again. I was and am very happy to be reunited with my old love.
