5,WTF?,"Have you idiots actually heard this album yet? This album is dope as hell.. plus the outlawz are rarely heard on this album.. it is 2004 and the beats are just matured and i think it sounds tight with a new beat going to pacs voice... i think its twice as good as resurrection.. and most of these people here give it 1 star because they beleive eminem is killin tupac.. not true.. the only ones killing him are the people who give his cds bad reviews and make his music rarely heard among the people... YOU ARE KILLING TUPAC.. LET HIS VOICE BE HEARD... THIS CD IS TOO TIGHT, GO GET IT!"
4,70's still have it,"its a nice collection. nothing new different or undiscovered. If you are looking to refresh your memory of what you heard on the radio, this is the collection. No Beatles, Stones, etc. Some one hit wonders."
2,Fair B-Horror,"Two movies-in-one here. Evil Maker 1 and 2 gives us a hodge podge of ebb and flow; the fist one is about a group of friends (all girls) that go on a road trip and end up at a house where evil dwells (oops, that's a title to a different movie); the movie bogs down with the obligatory last-act-of-the-movie-first scenario that tells us...nothing...and the movie is about thirty minutes too long at getting to the conclusion, which involves a confusing plot twist and an equally confusion murderous response. eh...okay b-horror with pizza and beer.The sequel sort of rearranges the storyline from the first film and becomes even more confusing...or maybe it's just confused all on its own...than ever. The sequel is not even good b-horror, but after a few beers you won't care."
3,Not my favorite,I'd like to see a movie with a more balanced cast. But try to find that in the U.S. It's mostly men.
4,Shakespearean Tragedy?,"I was left not knowing which of four possible interpretations to rest my thoughts upon (i.e. to whom do we fix the blame for Jolene's revolving relationships) in this Shakespearean tragedy as follows:First, that it was Jolene's own undoing through her selfish misuse of her attractiveness.Second, that it was Jolene's misfortune to be attractive in a culture that manipulates that attractiveness i.e. societal values.Third, that males for the most part are manipulative for their own ends irrespective of the harm it would inflict upon Jolene (or whomever the object of attention is).Fourth, that it's the gods (or fate, whatever) that map out our destinies, Jolene's in this case, and she and her males (well, partners) were just pawns in a predestined fate.Anyway, good script, directing, acting, pace, tone and cinematography. As for how the movie ends, one interpretation is that you just need to continue the pattern she finds herself in. Or, another is ..."
4,A (mostly) Fun Ride!,"I could have easily watched another two hours of Jolene--it was that enjoyable. I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the last part of the film. It seemed out of place with the rest of the movie, but I did really like it and could even see it as a TV series. I'd follow Jolene anywhere!"
5,... and the 8x magnification is good too,"while my game isn't quite good enough (yet) to need to know if the pin is 87 yards out vs. 85 1/2 yards (which this is apparently accurate enough to tell you), i do benefit from knowing that the green is in the general vicinity of 85 - which is fortunate, because if needed to know precisely I'd have to mount this thing on a tripod - the hand-held aspect of aiming at something a hundred or so yards away means that (at least in MY hands) you're going to be lucky to get the same reading twice. Which isn't to say that this is not a useful tool - like i said, i only need to know ABOUT how far i am to pick the right club --- and then i can use the 8x scope to see if i hit it up next to the hole!"
2,Boring,"I really dont know how anyone can enjoy this movie, the movie keeps on skipping backwards and forwards in time and in the end you are so confused that the movie doesnt make sense. I bought the movie based on the reviews and what a disappointment and a waste of money."
4,The Best of Stretch,"This movie is the best Gary Stretch movie ever. His character is so different from all the others that he has played before. You can't help but root for him all the way through. With clever sarcasm for humor and danger everywhere, this is the real definition of having a bad day."
5,Amazng Film,"This is an amazing film (as the title implies). Craig Singer did an fantastic job making this film. This Captivating film will leave you on the edge of your seat, and by the end will have your jaw dropped. Its a shame this movie wasn't picked up and put in theaters nation wide, because this movie is on the same level as pulp fiction and reservoir dogs and would become an instant classic."
5,What a great movie!,"If this movie doesn't tug at your heart, you don't have one. Gerard Butler & Emily Mortimer had incredible chemistry. This is one of Gerard Butler's finest! Loved the Scottish settings and the dialog! Just returned from a trip to Scotland and didn't get to those areas but love the country. This movie deserves a sequel!"
4,Excellent!!!!,I was surprised how much I liked this movie. I was expecting your typical romance movie. It has so much depth and substance. Well worth it!
4,Powerful acting,"I truely enjoyed this film. I'm usually all about the fluff of a film, but I gave this a look because of Gerard Butler. I came away from it loving the little boy, his mother, and his grandmother's roles more. However, the one scene with the mother and the stranger (Gerard Butler's character) on the dock is extremely moving. I agree that it is a very powerful movie and worth taking a look."
5,A movie worth watching! (which isn't easy to come by),"This movie has depth, emotion, realistic characters and relationships, a story that hasn't been told a hundred times, and a beautiful soundtrack. Movies like this are few and far between!"
5,Delightly Beautiful Movie,"Not knowing the cast or anything about the movie, but was told to watch it from customers, it surprised me on how much of a great movie it was. After I had seen it I pretty much put it in the back of my mind. Then I started to see more movies featuring Gerard Butler, so I re-watched the movie and it had brought me to tears.The movies story is so realistic down to earth about a mothers love for her son, wanting to protect her son from any ""futher"" harm, but wants to hear his voice by writing to him as his father, and the kid writes back. Mothers desperate need to fulfill her sons happiness, hires a ""fake dad"" to play his fathers roll. Thats when Gerard Butler comes to play.Amazing movie, full of happiness, and understand of family connection, and that a role model is needed in a kids life."
5,Dear frankie,I absolutely love this movie it is so touching I cried then I wanted to watch it over and over again!!! such a good movie about a mother's love for her son
4,GREAT SOUNDTRACK,This is a wonderful CD but my only regret is that it didn't have a particular song (Great White Horse) included because it played such an important role throughout the film. Other than that it was wonderful!
4,Dear Frankie Review,"I was very suprised at how much I liked this movie. It takes place in Scotland and it's about a mother, son, and grandmother that have been moving around from place to place most of Frankie's(the son)life. He has been writing letters to his father who is on a ship that travels the world. You find out however that his father really isn't on a ship and that Frankie's mother has been writing the letters to make it appear as if Frankie really is hearing from his dad.It's a great movie about what a mother will do for her child, to protect him. It's a great movie and I definatly reccomend seeing it."
5,Dear Frankie,This was a wonderful movie. All the performances were first rate. Emily Mortimer was very good as the mother. Frankie was totally believable as the deaf child. Gerard Butler as the Stranger was great. Can't think of anyone better for this role. The grandmother and best friend were also very good. I recommend this movie highly.
2,Gerard Butler is no actor!,"Butler's range of emotions in this movie, ran the gamut from A to B.There was so much that could have been achieved by an actor with a broader range of emotions.The story held a lot of promise, but the performance kept letting me down because I saw none of the anticipated emotion shown by this important character.The child who played Frankie was very good, as was Emily Mortimer and the actress who played her mother, but Butler's flatness ruined the movie for me."
5,I Love this Movie,"I enjoyed this movie very much. Its a ""slice of life"" movie, there isn't a grand opening, or ending, but the story line is sweet and the music is beautiful."
4,Glasgow....the bright side...,"Anything that comes out of Scotland, esp. Glasgow,(i.e. Craig Ferguson, etc.) is exceptional and this film does not dissapoint. Loved the inside look into a country that is romanticized via Edinburgh and the casting was surprising. My only issue is that the paranoia was overdone with Lizzie's character...""What right do you have to do that?"" was just not a believable response to Butler's character request to give the xtra bang for her buck. For me that is hardly worth mentioning. This gem also made me want some decent Fish n Chips for dinner!!!"
1,Very slowwwwww,"This movie was so slow I couldn't get through the whole thing. I won't base my movie selection on reviews anymore since I'm starting to appreciate that most of the reviews are ""paid"" reviews and therefore not reliable. Makes me crazy, honestly, and I wish that wasn't allowed."
4,Dear Frankie,Very sweet story line. Excellent acting by all characters. would recommend to anyone to watvh. Gerard Butler is awesome as the stranger.
4,Lovely story,This is quite a touching story about the lengths a mother will go through to protect her son. Both the acting and directing were excellent. My only negative comment is that there is a scene with quite bad language in it and the grandmother takes the Lord's name a few times.
4,LOVE LETTERS STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART,"A quiet,effective little drama that focuses on love and fulfillment. Young Frankie Morrison writes letters to his seaman father, not knowing that when he was a wee lad his Mom left his Dad because he was abusive. Lizzie Morrison (Emily Mortimer) is answering the boy's letters, letting him believe his father is gone due to his life as a sailor. The charade comes to an end when Frankie discovers his father's vessel is scheduled to dock in Glasgow and he wonders if his father will come see him. A desperate Lizzie hires a handsome stranger (Gerard Butler) to pose as Frankie's Dad for just one day so as not to unveil the truth behind the years of subterfuge.The three leading actors are truly inspired and give delicately balanced performances, making what could have been trite and maudlin subtly powerful. My only complaint comes with an unexpected twist at the end that doesn't seem to be justified. But DEAR FRANKIE is still quite an emotionally evocative film."
2,90 mile drive and completely worth it!,"My mom and I drove 90 miles to get to see this movie. We had been looking forward to it for months, and were afraid that it wasn't going to play anywhere near us. When we saw it, we loved it so much that we went to lunch and came back for the next show. It was an amazing cast and a beautiful story. I can't wait to add it to my movie collection"
2,Dear Frankie,"Didn't like the story line, thought it was weak, and just couldn't buy into the charaters, and actually gave my DVD away after viewing it,,,"
2,movie review,"I mildly enjoyed this show,. I thought it wasn't as good as the previews led you to believe but it was ok"
4,Bittersweet,"The last 10 minutes of this movie still have me confused, but that being said, I still enjoyed this movie. Once your ears get used to the accents you really don't hear it anymore, you are engrossed in the sweet story of Liz and her son Frankie.Liz flees with Frankie to Scotland to escape the bonds of an abusive man and pretends Frankie's father is aboard a ship called the HMS Accra. After setting the story for Frankie and pretending for years, which include fake letters detailing adventures and destinations, the make-believe story comes to a crashing end when Frankie learns that the ship has docked near their new home and Liz must find a man who is willing to pretend he is Frankie's dad. What could be comical is bittersweet and a deaf little boy is left with magical memories."
4,Complex,"Story of a boy, Frankie and those who love him; his mom who has protected him from a disturbing past and who leads him to believe that his father is a merchant seaman who writes from various ports of call; his grandmum, a kind neighbor and schoolfriends. The story in the story is the Stranger, who is hired to portray Frankie's absent father for a day. The musical score is wonderful and the movie is short on dialogue so the visuals and music have a lot of impact. A movie for the whole family."
5,Excellent film. So glad it's on dvd and easily available now,Great small film that gets its hooks into you and makes you love it. So well done.I hope all the reviews that lay out the entire film here don't wreck the surprises for the new viewer; this is a gem of a film.Watch it.
1,The White Pony,"Awful kid's movie unless you turn off the sound and fast forward through some parts!It shows kids stealing, spying, behaving spitefully, lying, disobeying adults, and badly whipping and spurring horses (until they bleed) and then actually gaining something by doing these things! It shows a young girl leaving the house at midnight to meet a strange man in the forest (the leprechaun, but still!).They also call The White Pony a ""she"" but it is most definitely a ""he"".Some nice scenery and lots of pretty shots of the white pony. Also some funny antics by the leprechaun."
3,Could have been better,"My kids enjoyed this for the horse action.But, the mythology is quickly brushed over & could have been expanded upon. Lots of whining. The evil cousin is selfish & mean, but the lead character Leah wasn't with out her own selfishness. The Uncle is cardboard. The leprechaun is a far better actor than this (bring back Willow!).For parental enjoyment get The Black Stallion."
3,No,"When a little girl named Leah (Carly Anderson) goes to visit relatives in Ireland, she meets a magical white mare called Sorcha and a charming leprechaun named Lucky (Warwick Davis). The three of them conspire to enter a big race, where Leah will have to compete with her evil cousin Shannon (Victoria Farrer).This move was way too young for me -- it's not a kids & adult movie -- but small children are likely to fall for the pony and the leprechaun.Staci Layne Wilson"
2,Unnecessarily corny and wooden acting,"My horse-crazy six-year-old is ho-hum about this one--jumbled mythology, wooden acting, contrived humor, flat characters, and above all--why on earth did they cast an obviously male horse to play the role of a mare? Get ""Black Beauty"" (the 1994-ish one that features real horses) or ""The Black Stallion"" instead!"
2,The White Pony,I bought this movie for my 2 1/2 year old who is fascinated by horses. This movie was too scary for him (he did NOT like the leprechan). I'll wait and try again in a few years...but I wouldn't recommend this movie for toddlers.
5,best wiccan book i ever bought,very informative. i have had this for a very long time and one i use very often. i dont even put it away anymore. it is always beside my altar!!
5,Very pleased,I count myself extremely fortunate that Scott Cunningham became the first teacher in my path. He explained things in down to earth language that I could understand and made it so simple for me to use the techniques he taught.He did a marvelous job and I highly recommend this book for those searching the Wiccan path.
5,A solid foundation for any beginner!,"Where to begin! This book is an invaluable source of information on wicca and its practices. The author's non-bias approach on the topic gives the readers an easy to understand format while teaching them the core fundamentals of the practice and the religion. The information is formatted for solitary use and is very usual for people interested yet don't have anyone else to work with. From the basics of self-dedication to the tidbits on divination and sabbat lore, this book will be treasured by the beginning practitioner as well as someone who just wants to know practice and religion it is all about."
4,Good for neophytes and intermediaries,"This book explains the basics of Wicca, or Witchcraft, in easy to understand language, what is is, why it exists, and how-to guides. Magick is inherent in ALL of us through the power of visualization. The rituals of witchcraft help us to learn this skill and maintain focus to direct our personal energy into the world to manifest needed changes. This isn't make-believe, it's real and has been confirmed by our society's scientists. What we call Goddess and God are merely two aspects of the Earth and we align ourselves in sympathy with the Earth by performing rituals in her honor. Scott's book gives several basic rituals and chants to help us focus on this subject. Candles, herbs, stones, runes, and statues are all geared to strengthening our focus on directing our own personal energy. There is a bigger world out there that we cannot see, we just need to tap into it!"
5,A wonderful book!,"This is a wonderful book! When any beginner into the Craft asks me ""What books do you recomend?"" I always recomend this one first. It was my first book, and I owe so much to Scott. This book got me where I am today and helped me discover the right path for me. It is a wonderful introduction into the earth-based religion of Wicca, and I recomend it to all beginners into the Craft and all people misinformed about this peaceful earth religion. May the God and Goddess always smile upon you!"
4,Another one for the shelf,This book serves as a helpful resource to both newcomers and practitioners alike. it creates a very general overview of what Wicca is and helps in deciding if it is the right faith for you. It is not a spell a book. I use it as assigned reading for my students though and highly recommend it. I keep a copy on my shelf right net to Bucklands books on Wicca.
2,"Good for Wiccans, but no one else.","As its title suggests, this book does quite well for Wiccans, and even more particularly, Wiccans of the traditional bent. I bought it on the basis of it being geared toward solitary practitioners, but found its heavy Wiccan bent uninteresting. I know Wiccans worldwide rave about Scott Cunningham, and I've seen worse authors, but unless you're a traditional Wiccan living in a rural area with lots of access to nature - and quite a bit of free time - this book isn't very useful."
2,"I really tried to love this book, BUT.....","Several years ago I was in a bookstore when I was about to purchase a general wicca book when a priestess approached me and recommended this book instead. It was very dry to me. I know it is to much ask to have it be entertaining, but at least it could have enlightened me! I only was able to read less then half way when I put it down. I picked up again after a few years and although I have grown and can understand the directness it became boring me to once again and very dry. I highly recommend as an alternative to this book any works written by Vivianne Crowley. Blessed be!"
2,Yes i Know he's the most famous Neo-wiccan Author..,But..This book and Living Wicca are too simple.Don't get me wrong i enjoy Cunningham pratical books ( i love wicca in the kitchen )but to follow the Godess Path you'll do better if you read Starwaks Spiral dance or Marian Green's Witch alone and for women who want to reach self-empowerment through self-knowledge you must read Lasara Firefox's Sexy Witch.
2,disappointment,"I am very disappointed on this book. I bought it for two reasons. First, it is Scott Cunningham's. Second, I needed a book to farther my knowledge in Wicca. It presented less ideas or feedback than the other books I've read on the same subject. The best thing on this book is the statement that one can approach Wicca individually. I believe that the younger generation or the teens will be more irritated at this book. It does not contain good spells. It does not teach or give ideas how to integrate crystals, herbs,oils, etc. while doing a spell or ritual. Teen-agers will have more participation in this craft if it shows the adventures in spell or rituals. Nevertheless, I think that Witches should still buy other books that Mr. Cunningham has written for more knowledge involving Witchcraft."
2,Too Simplistic,"I was very disappointed with this book. Not what I expected at all. Buckland's ""Complete Book of Witchcraft"" if much more informational and flows from topic to topic much better."
1,Not your best option,"Scott Cunningham was a gentle soul and wrote some important reference books, but this book is not one of those. Commonly recommended as a beginner's first Witchcraft book, unfortunately it's just fluff. Cunningham is lily-white, childlike, and uniformative in this and his other ""Witchcraft 101"" books. If you're a serious beginner and have some idea about what witchcraft and magick are about, skip this book and travel straight through to The Spiral Dance by Starhawk and/or Natural Magick by Sally Dubats. If you're completely ignorant, or for some reason want a very slow, gentle, dull introduction to the life of a Witch, then this is your book. Otherwise, don't waste the money."
5,Love it!,"Scott Cunningham's writing is easy to understand and is not ""this is the truth and you'd better believe it"". He is very liberal and understanding of people who were brought up in strict religions. He makes the transition to Wicca very easy. He is very ""down to earth"". Literally. I consult one or more of his books several times a week."
4,Wonderful book!,"This was the first book I bought on the Craft and it remains one of my favorites. Scott Cunningham writes a lot of useful info for the solitary practitioner. He talks about Wicca & Shamanism in Chapter One and moves on to talk about the Wiccan deities (the Lord and the Lady) in Chapter Two. He tells us about the different forms of magick and how to adapt it in our daily lives and use it successfully. He speaks about the main tools that Wiccans handle and it tells how they are used in modern day Witchcraft. He talks about the 'spiral of rebirth' (reincarnation) and tells us about the Wiccan 'days of power' (the esbats which are full moon rites when you pay homage to the Goddess and it also talks about the eight Wiccan festivals which follows the life cycle of the Horned God). Overall, this book was great and I'm glad how Cunningham focuses on the spiritual part of Wicca instead of the whole spell-casting stuff.--Blessed Be"
4,One of the Reasons I'm a Wiccan,"Of course, it's just one reason, clearly overshadowed by spirituality and following my heart, but still, this book was the second book on witchcraft I ever read. The first being Starhawk's Spiral dance, while inspiring, was a bit hard to work into my own beliefs and practices. Not to mention the lack of a coven.So it was the guide made for me. The solitary practioner. It's clear, concise, and quite adaptable.My one problem was with the idea of self initiation. I still don't quite get the point. But that's really a personal connundrum I'm still pondering.I highly reccommend this to beginners and my fellow wiccans that get a bit sidetracked from the path every once in a while. It's great for a brush up or simple reaffirmation."
4,A great toe-in-the-water book!,This is a wonderful primer for those just beginning on the path. Cunningham aptly communicates some of the joys in the choice to live more in harmony with one's self and counterparts. The book definately provides good coverage of the basics and is never preachy- a simple what-to-do and when-to-do-it primer that still allows the reader to find his or her own way while still feeling a part of something larger. Dig in and enjoy the mystery of your life!!
5,A Must Have!!!,"Every witch MUST have this book on their magickal shelves. This is basically a beginner's book, but every witch should brush up on the basics here and there. It explains tools, the deities, holidays, spells, etc. Cunningham writes in a simple, yet effective manner and is easy to understand. If you are interested in Wicca or want to review the simple stuff, check this book out!"
4,wicca 101,"Wonderful! Exactly what I was looking for. All of the information in a very easy to read format. All the ""new wicca"" or just curious could ever want to know. If you are not comfortable with or just don't have access to a group to practice your craft with, then this is THE Book for you!"
3,Another good starter,"Like living wicca this a the basic of basic. easy to read giving most of your basic information. This book has essentially the same information as Living Wicca the only diffrance is that this one was directed to the solitary and written to accomidate that. If you are solitary I would pick this one over the other, then again if your not sure which you are just pick one or the other. You'll pretty much get the same picture. Either is a good starting point with little hint as to where to go next. I suggest topics such as Sabats, Rits of passage, or single holiday type books that focus on indvidual sabats if you want more on spirituality side of Wicca after this. If you are looking for more along the lines of magick I suggest ""Making Magick"" I wouldn't suggest diving into coven or group things untill you have learned a little more.Good starting place."
3,Good Book,"This book is very good for beginners at Wicca and people who want to know more about Wiccan belifs. I, personally, thought the book to be a bit brief and not very informative, skipping many important details. It's written as though the author tried to skim along everything, but maybe it's that I like reading detailed books (like To ride a silver broomstick) when it comes to teaching anything."
4,A very informative and interesting read,"This was my first book on Wicca. It was very informative, and was an interesting read. But it didn't have very many spells."
4,A great tool for beginners,I enjoyed this book very much. There are many good ideas to get you thinking. This book is not to be followed word for word like many other Wicca books. Scott wants to give readers ideas in which to form their own spiritual path. I was also relieved that this book didn't come off like a man's book. Wicca is primarily thought of as a women's religion and I was skeptical at first to read a book written by a man but he did a great job.
5,Good book for starters,"Is a simple to understand first book of wicca. However, be advice to read more books from other authors and make your own impression of what the craft should mean to you, since is a very personal religion.Scott was one of the best wicca writers, his legacy is sure to survive..."
5,Wicca Wonder!!!,"I have just started learning about wicca and this book helped a lot! At first I thought it looked really boring because the cover isnt actually enthralling, but when I started reading it it was really quite gripping! Ideal for a beginer who wants to know what its all about."
5,It couldn't get any better!!!,"This was the first book I bought on Wicca and it really gave the push I needed. I found it to be the ideal for beginners like me that are just getting started in the craft and need a book that explains all the basics. I couldn't put it down while reading it and found myself comming back to it almoust every day. It even comes with a little ""Book of shadows"" so you can start practising on your own. If you are just curious about wicca or want to follow its path, but want to practise on a solitary bases, this is the book for you.I thank Scott Cunningham for this wonderful book.Blessed be."
5,The best book for solitary witches,"Scott Cunningham's 'Wicca: a guide...' is the perfect book when you don't have access to a coven or group.I bought it because i wanted to be a solitary witch, but i didn't knew anyone who could learn me the basics.But this book did, and it even has a section wherein the autor has written his own Book of Shadows!That section is very useful to create your own spells and rituals, and it learns you how to do different kinds of magic work.And when you have finished reading this book, you really have to buy the sequel: 'Living Wicca: a furher guide...'!"
5,AWESOME,"With the caveat that a few small errors in the book annoyed me, this is the quintissential Wicca for beginners book. It really rates a 4.98 or so, because it is not ""perfect"" but it is pretty close.Like all Wicca books, it shouldn't stand alone on your shelf, though..."
4,A wonderful resource for the beginning Wiccan,"Pick your path, and if it's Wicca, get this book. Then again, the first two chapters are wonderful reads for almost any type of Pagan, so even if you're simply researching paths, at least check it out."
2,Wicca,"This is one of the first books I bought when I first started studying Wicca and Witchcraft. I found its simple, friendly style easy to digest. I was also intrigued with all the reference to stones, incense and oils. Well, stones, incense and oils can be found in aromatherapy books or lists of rocks and minerals; used to beautify one's home. Good beginning book for modern, general Wicca."
4,Easy to understand,The basics. Recommended for beginners. Cunningham is quite free in his path. Quite an enjoyable read.
2,What ever happened to the religous experience?,"I didn't like this book for the same reasons I don't like Buckland. It's a ""just do it"" witchcraft book. There no regard whatsoever to the rich pictoral folklore of old Europe, which, whether modern Wiccans will admit itor not, played a larger role in the developement of Wiccan beliefs than did any genuine historical tradition. The rituals are all about energies. The book is geared toward new agers, not Earth worshippers.This is the kind of paganism that you can practice in your sleep. ""Feels the energies"" he says over and over again. Condensing those energies into actual entities, like faeries, is what separate pagans from your standard new ager. But, like I said, Cunningham's devotion to history and folklore amounts to almost nothing. There are some good listings for corropondances, but what is there is shortened, meaning you'll have to look elsewhere if you're looking for a 'complete' Wiccan resource."
2,You Could Do Better,"This book was supposedly for the solitary practitioner, right? So why did I feel like Cunningham was trying to walk me hand-in-hand through every step of my Wiccan beginning? C'mon Scott, let me think for myself! Almost half of the book is his own Book of Shadows, which sucks by the way. If you're a beginner look for Jennifer Hunter's ""21st Century Wicca"", it's a much better book with more practical info for the beginner. If you absolutely NEED something to read, Cunningham's book will suffice, but wait for your initiation until after you've read Hunter!"
5,for those who want to know,Scott Cunningham's books are very simple to understand. if you are not sure of things and want to know then his books are the ones to read
4,An excellent book for the beginning practitioner.,"Scott cunningham does a marvelous job showing the openness and tranquility surrounding Wicca. I have learned a great deal from this, and I would recomend this book to anyone interested in Wicca."
5,Scott Cunningham rules!,"Scott Cunningham does the best work on solitary practices I have ever seen! He stresses a lot on the concept of ""doing it yourself"" but offers very helpful guidelines. Most other books talk about the way they do it in their own tradition, and you're left confused afterwards when you pick up a different book. But not Scott Cunningham; he keeps it straight and simple. I'd recommend anything and everything by him. Walk always in light and love!"
5,wonderfull beginners book,I read and re-read this book it is simple and practical..a must have for solitaries.Cunningham brilliantly and comprehensively writes a guide book withenough information to get anyone into the practice of the craft..A+++
3,Not bad,"But not great either. For a better introduction to 'magic' I prefer Ross Heaven's Vodou Shaman. Cunningham, for all his efforts, seems to fall into the 'new age' (clap) trap and could have given us far more than he does. I think of it as an also-ran on my bookshelf but I'd rather have it than not."
5,Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner,"Great book, I find myself referring to it over and over again."
4,helpful manual,"That's alot of pages for a nice price, filling your brain with delightful little Wiccan notions to combat ""reality."" Conversational language about a topic that proves interesting and worthwhile.Enjoyable book."
4,It's A Start,This is a great book for starters. You will find this book tops many reading lists in other how-to books. It covers many basics and provide you great basic knowledge of tools and ritual.
4,For those approaching WIcca for the first time...,"This book is probably the best place to start. Scott ""holds your hand"" while explaining the basics of Witchcraft and Pagan worship. So many books come at you with pentagrams flashing, spellcasting-a-plenty, or they are presented in such an arcane manner that it fails to present any clarity for the newcomer. This book is clear and straight forward. It is sometimes opinionated, but you are given the freedom to form your own thoughts and feelings about his descriptions of the Gods and Wiccan practice. Every seasoned Witch that I know mentions Scott to inquirey minds. I do too. If you are at a point where you ""think"" Wicca is for you, but you still feel like you're afraid to take the first step, open this book, take Scott's hand, and walk together towards the truth about this beautiful religion."
3,Amazing Content Leaves You Wanting More,"I found this book to being a great starting point full of excellent technical materials. However, if you've already read up on the basics, you'll find it a tad shallow. The author's writing style lends itself perfectly to self education and I would read another piece by him without much provocation. In summary, I just wished it was longer. Blessed Be!"
5,Good for beginners,This book covers the basics of Wicca in a way thats easy to read. Personally I found it quite boring but it does have good information for people starting out on this path.
5,The best biginners book on Wicca I have seen so far.,"I have read a lot of books on Wicca, and this was the first real influential one I had found. When I first became interested in Wicca in 1983 there were not many ""how to"" books out there, and the ones that existed were hard to find. After reading Sybil Leek's ""The Complete Art of Witchcraft"" I had to piece concepts and rituals togeather from what sketchy sources I could find. If I had this book then It would have been so much easier. I bought this book in 1988 and have used it as the backbone of my religious practice ever since. It is deffinitly bare bones, but it encourages you to build up on the information given with other books, and more importantly, your own inspiration. I have never found a book on Wicca that covered everything, and I recomend reading as many books as possible (including the sequel to this book ""Living Wicca""),but this is one of the best beginner books out there."
3,Its ok,I liked some aspects of it but it didn't follow what I prefer but it is a good start for newbies
3,A decent introduction,"Most of what is in Cunningham's book one could find in a variety of good Wicca websites if one took an evening to search. Having said that, though, this book is a convienent reference for all the basic info to start your baby steps on the Wicca path. It's a friendly and completely comprehensible introduction, appropriate for people of all ages and intellectual persuasions. But for those who are expecting a more detailed, critical, and scholarly exposition on this exciting new religion, don't expect to find it here. Anyway, if you're completely new to the tradition, and want a layman's explanation in the very basics of Wicca, this book is certainly worth a 10 spot.To thine and thee, Bright Blessing be."
4,A Great Guide For Beginners!,"Since I am completely new to the Wiccan path I realized that (obviously) I needed to study if I really wanted to take on this religion. This is the first book that I bought, which was only around five days ago. In this book their was great information that dragged me in. It had some wonderful basics that any beginner would need to know. For myself, I just found it amazingly helpful and I am very positive that Wiccan is the path I want. (My mother has given me the choice to pick any religion and she told me she would support me in any way.)One part of the book when it showed and told about an altar and it's layout was a nice touch. I also enjoyed the many symbols that I had no awareness of until after I had finished with this piece. I recommend this book for anyone who is trying to start off as a Wiccan or who wishes to just know more about it."
4,Young Solitary,"This book was surprisingly thorough, with oulines on the histoy of wicca, basic sabbat rituals, easy spells, runes, and tools of the craft, plus much more. There's even a list of uselful publications at the back, like newsletters etc. and also occult and metaphysical stores, although most of them are in the US so it's not very useful for people who live in other countries. Other than that the information is perfect for the novice Wicca."
5,Perfect for a beginner,"This is a wonderful book for anyone who is beginning their journey into Wicca!! It was the 2nd book I ever had and I recommend it to anyone! Scott talks in an easy to understand lingo w/ a glossary just in case. He includes all the basics and walks you through some of the exercices. Whether you are 12 or 21 this book is a great primer. If you like straightforward books that are an easy read, buy this NOW!!!"
5,This book is great for beginning Wiccans.,"I'm a teen who seeks to learn more about Wicca to pratice it and this book is great. I think Scott C. is a great writer because he shares his point of veiw w/ some things in the book.I think this book is really getting me on the right foot to praticing Wicca, right. I've seen and read a few other books,but think this book is the best. If you have any doubts about this book, you shouldn't. It's a great book for anyone to learn about Wicca."
5,Great book for beginners!,"This is a great little book and I love it to death! ""Wicca"" was one of the first books I bought on the subject and I refer to it again and again. While it does not cover, or even give a hint of, the vastness of Goddess worship and earth spirituality (of course, it's not meant to be), it provides a step in the right direction for anyone interested in the practice of Wicca. I highly recommend it!"
2,Nothing to brag about.........,"This book did nothing for me. A little harder to understand than I thought it would be. There are much better books out there, like The Wicca Bible. Now THAT'S the perfect little book......."
1,Wicca : A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner,"This book, like all Scott Cunningham's work is over written and full of mistakes.A self proclaimed Witch.His books are rubbish, I could do better, as a person never mind a witch.To, me he has stolen other peoples ideas, re-worked some and made a lot up."
1,Do I have to give it a star ?,"Probably the worst book I've read. Absolutely nothing to do with Wicca, The Craft or whatever your term for it."
5,Great for beginners,"This book is great for beginners. I can honestly say i have learned a lot. How to celebrate the sabbats, how to cast a circle, recipes and more.."
3,A little common sense,"Much of this is similar to other books and suggestions for those starting out...as well as a good reference for those of us who want to refresh our memories. Personally, if you already have Living Wicca by this author, you don't need this as well. The two overlap considerably."
4,A New Beginning,A friend of mine suggested that since i was not satisfied with the rigidity of religion i should check out Wicca. This book has taught me more than i imagined. i only heard of the Wicca in passing before but it is a very rich and insightful way of life. I like the fact that it encourages wellbeing and good interpersonal relationships. As i go thru the practices and learn more i feel more and more in control of my life by letting go of that control. i enthusiastically recommend this book to any and all from the slightly curious to those who already know all. Blessed Be.
3,Soft Opening for Beginners,"Cunningham has a way of showing beginners, who aren't looking for a group, ways to understand this religion. Not all of his direction is complete... but whose books about this subject are? A great introduction."
3,Good ... and bad!,"This book provides a VERY GENERAL overview: far too broad for my liking. I do not quite understand the great praise this book receives from other reviewers. Silver Ravenwolf's books are far superior. This being said, there are several parts of the book that are very good.First. The alter devotion ritual appearing in the earily chapters of the book is very moving. This is often overlooked by other authors.Second. Many of the prayers within the book of shadows are quite good."
3,Good for beginners,"This was the first Wicca book I had read. I remember that fall just a few short years ago. But had I known then what I know now. I would not have read it. Some people may like the spoon-fed type of information Cunningham presents but if you really want to learn about Wicca. I recomend Wicca: The Old Religion in the New Millennium by Vivianna Crowley instead.I'm not bad-mouthing this book, however. It is very good for beginners. It explains things in a very simple easy to understand manner. But you have to make your own decision."
3,Not as inclusive as I would have liked...,"While this book does give an excellent overview of Wicca, and I personally have found it as a valuable reference source, it is written from the perspective that everyone who practices Wicca is white (of European origins), and is male. Hopefully one will not rely on this book as your foundation and/or single introduction to the craft. Other books are a little more favorable to all forms of the Craft and most usually include multiple names for Sabbats/Holidays. Prime example, this book lists August 1 as Lughnasadh vs. adding the widely used Lammas."
5,In formative and helpful,"I didn't plan on reading this book, but as soon as I started I was not able to put it down. It helped me to understand the beliefs of my friends and taught me that parts of Christianity came from nonchristian religions. This book is great to read even if you don't know anyone who believes it."
5,Great For Starters,"This book is a great start for beginners or for those who are simply curious. However, that's about it; there is nothing here that will change your life in any way or make you think any differently. It's mostly lecture-like material here."
4,~ Scott was truly an asset to the pagan community,I can not say anything bad about Scott Cunningham's books. This one is a very concise guide to the Wiccan way of life for the individual. It gets straight to the point and is not confusing. It is definitely a great addition to anybody's Wiccan library.
4,An excellent guide ... but not the sole source,"No book can give you everything... but this one gives you a lot of helpful info. When combined with a few others, you'll have a prime Magickal library. It is helpful also to those working in groups, or just learning about Wiccan rites."
5,My review,This book is an excellent introduction to the practice of Wicca. I ordered this as a replacement copy because my original was lost in a fire.
4,Got Passion? Got Pizazz?,"This Book is very informative. It has all the information that I've been looking for, it's the real deal. The only thing is, the author's writing style is not very exciting. I'd prefer something with a little more pizazz and passion you can feel when you read it. I think religion and belief systems are something one should feel passionate about, and that should show through in writing."
4,Superficial,"I bought this book a half a year a go, and when I read it, I've noticed that Cunningham takes Wicca more like a craft only and only a little as a religion. Of course that he does mention the God and the Goddess, but when he does, it's very superficial. This book gives a brief information about what the craft is really as a religion, and the rituals in the book of shadows section are very superficial too. I follow the idea that religion is something that we want it to be and we can change it to be suitable for us, but when it comes to a lack and it looks like a flippancy, It would be better to work harder because it should be something special (rituals in particular). Except of the lack of these things, this book gives a good point of view on the craft, and it's very good for newcomers who hesitate to make the first step when making rituals of their own."
2,Very disappointing....Good book for teenagers being introduced to Wicca,"After reading the reviews I was excited to order this book, but I was very disappointed. It seemed to be written for a teenager new to Wicca. I found it very boring and simplistic. I am new to Wicca, but I found this book dull and much too simplistic. For me, the author took the joy out of learning Wicca. I have been unable to read it through because I feel as though I am reading a children's book. I felt it was a waste of money. Boring....boring....boring"
3,very easy,"This book is really easy written: it helps the beginners. In fac it has just the basics of Wicca. I'm not a Wiccan but I've been studying Wicca for 5 years now. This is more young oriented, than self-practitioner oriented. One thing I didn't like was the concept that you can do whatever you want as long as it feels comfortable to you. This is only partly right because, being it a religion, it must have at least some things that are in common. Anyway, if you are new to the Craft and would like to know just the basis (there isn't the history of this religion, and there isn't any moral judgement anyway I would recommend it for beginners)."
4,GREAT!,FOR A BEGINNER THIS IS A GREAT BOOK. IT SHOW ME THERE IS MORE THAN ONE WAY TO BE WICCAN. HE ENCOURAGE YOU TO BE AN ECLECTIC WICCAN. GO WITH YOUR HEART OR WHAT FEELS RIGHT FOR YOU.
3,Eh...,"It's pretty basic. I would only recommend this book to those who have no idea what witch craft is. Better yet, the information in this book you can easily find on websites throughout the internet. Still, a good book. Not great. Good."
3,great book,"I own this book, and i enjoy it very much it gives many dates for holidays and so on. I can't wait to get more books of this sort"
5,GREAT!!,I am just a beginner and this book is the first i read and i think it is just great. It tells u in detail what Wicca is and what witchs do and dont do. Please if ur going to start Wicca read this book.
5,One of the best books of its kind!,"Cunningham's Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner was the first book I'd ever read on the subject, and it was truly enlightening. It took me through the philosophy and technicalities of Wicca, step by step, at a pace I could handle. It is written magnificently in an easily understandable way, and is extremely accessible. I highly recommend it to the beginning Witch, or even the seasoned one. His tone is almost fatherly, and this could be the next best thing to a one-on-one teacher. My extreme gratitude goes out to Mr Cunningham, wherever he may be."
5,Great for a Novice Like me!,"Mr. Cunningham explains Wicca simply and right to the point. He dispells all the myths and gives meaning to the true Wiccan art. I am going to purchase more of his many books on this subject, since I am a novice and have much to learn. If you are also new to exploring Wicca this is the book for you! Ladybug"
3,Sorry forgot I had even bought this one,Looks like I need to reexamine my book collection because somehow I forgot I had this book in it. I know there were recipes I had wanted out of here... must be time to revisit the information. Thanks for the reminder!
4,Stories beat philosophy,"I like some of the stories in this collection very much. Especially those (e.g.""Helen Morley's Finger"") in which Walter Benesch's great sense of humor and absurdity lets you forget about any underlying philosophical concepts.I for my part read the stories as stories and - philosophers forgive me - it worked fine."
3,slightly better than the last book,"I had been anticipating the new LP guide for Armenia for quite awhile. I must admitthat when I finally got it I was disappointed. It is better than the last one, but that's not saying much. The information is OK, but not extensive. There are barely any photos, so you don't really get a good feel for any of the places. The maps are so small that you need a magnifying glass to read them. And, the 6 pages dedicatedto Karabagh just doesn't cut it!"
1,interesting but waste of money,Not much more I can say other than it was interesting at first but I should have bought something more useful.
4,Worth having,"Although Aretha's second album is not one of my favorites, ARETHA ARRIVES is worth having. Some of the soul ballads, such as ""Never Let Me Go"" and ""I Wonder, don't have the same force and soulfulness that really gets one feeling as those on the albums Soul 69 and I Never Loved a Man albums. However, on this album is also one of Aretha's best-ever covers--""Going Down Slow."" It's refreshing that it's not a love ballad, but about sin and ""failing."" Considering Aretha's heritage in the Church, the song has all the more weight. The final cry at the end runs straight through the body. Of course on the album there is the sexy, aggressive hit, ""Baby, I Love You."" The other tracks on the album are good, such as the Rolling Stone's ""Satisfaction"" and Sinatra's ""That's Life,"" even if they don't let Aretha's talent shine through as brilliantly as some of her other renditions of other artists' work."
5,A Great Flick Everyone Should See,"Severe Injuries is a great independant film, and unlike some of the indie flicks out there Severe Injuries gives you great acting,great story and plot and a great directoral effort by Amy Lynn Best. If you are into the horror and comedy genre you will love Severe Injuries. Also i would say Amy's performance as Lauren was right up there to the Jaime Lee Curtis's Laurie Strode... And be on the look out for the always great Lloyd Kaufman of Troma as a doctor"
3,Analytical tools applied to venture analysis.,"Costello offers an analytical approach to new venture creation, assessment and planning. He describes the use of tools taken from such fields as strategic planning, marketing and operations research - and discusses how they can be applied to opportunity analysis and business planning.Much of the discussion is oriented to ""Intrapreneuring"" within an existing organization, but would apply to startup venture analysis notwithstanding.Though the book may be somewhat dated, he does a good job of describing processes for new venture analysis and of reviewing some of the analytical tools.The book is quick to read (178 pp) and would be a good reference text for planners."
1,"The Aesop for Children - Olive with gold print cover, small mouse in corner","I ordered this and I got a black and white illustrated version, not color as indicated. The cover was different too. What I love about this book is the color illustrations, and that is what was displayed. They said they had two left, and now they say they have one left. Not sure if they ever had the one that is pictured. Mine had a deep blue cover with Red title and big mouse on front. Red on Navy blue, and all black and white looked like bad copies of original illustrations. Too bad. Don't know where to get the ""real"" one....Ahh, it looks like they have shipped another and probably the right one with no extra charge! I am returning the other one. Thanks, Amazon!Very sincerely,Barb"
5,Childhood revisited,I had this book as a child and bought it to share with my grandsons. They love it. We've had some great discussions about the stories and morals. A wonderful way to pass on values to the next generation.
3,"Good Customer Service, Product was ""off""","The ""star"" ranking above it a bit misleading; the perfume itself was ""off."" Its color was darker than usual and the scent was less floral/fruity and more like alcohol than usual. I think this is a manufacturer issue, however, as it has happened on previous occasions with bottles I have purchased from a different vendor. Parfum1 accepted the return and credited my account, so I am pleased with the overall experience."
5,Praise God Using Bellydance,"FINALLY a GREAT DVD designed to praise God using something different-BELLYDANCE!! I personally brought this DVD & LOVED it!!! I thought that this DVD was VERY WELL put together, by a very knowledgeable- GREAT INSTRUCTOR! The instructor ""Porsha"" did a FANTASTIC JOB with clearly breaking down each movement to teach a full length praise dance routine to the song ""Not Forgotten"" !!This DVD is PERFECT if you would like to learn a complete praise routine, with God being center of your workout!GREAT spirit filled workout/ instructional video!"
5,More like this!,A great book. With easy accessible yoga philosophy. George have great books that will teach you the path of yoga philosophy clearly.
4,Porky's II: The Next Day,"I saw this movie years ago on HBO & just recently bought it on VHS. Porky's II is actually good, in spite of itself. Pee-Wee & the gang are back for more adventures & more jokes. Although I missed Porky himself, I enjoy watching this movie. I especially enjoy the payback paid to the crooked Reverend Flavel, Commissioner Gebfart, the City Council & the KKK. Porky's II does have a few slow moments, but nevertheless it is enjoyable to watch to get a few laughs."
4,comign of age adventures,This is a DVD for more mature audiences. It follows a group of horny boys through high school. You see the trouble hormones can get you into. Their hijinks are amusing though.
1,WHY EVEN MAKE A SEQUEL TO A MOVIE LIKE ''PORKY'S''?,"THE ABSOLUTE WORST OF THE SERIES. THIS TIME, THE GANG HAS TO FIGHT RELIGIOUS FANATICS TO DO A STAGE SHOW. NOW, I ONLY HAVE 1 QUESTION, WHY DIDN'T THEY BRING BACK PORKY?!!!!! WITHOUT HIM, THIS MOVIE WAS A TOTAL DISASTER. THE PLOT IS SENSELESS [WELL, ALL THE PLOTS FOR THE PORKY'S MOVIES WERE STUPID], THEY'RE HARDLY ANY FUNNY SCENES, AND IT'S JUST UNNECESSARY TO EVEN DO THIS SEQUEL. ABSOLOUTELY BORING AND UNFUNNY ON ALL LEVELS."
2,Check out the Troma originals!,"What is it with movies that they only become popular if as little original as possible? The Porky's series have, for some reason, reached an enormous popularity, while they were more than just highly influenced by far superior productions made years before them. Lloyd Kaufman's SQUEEZE PLAY (1980) and WAITRESS (1982) both appeared before the first imitation in the Porky series (1982), and although they had reasonably successfull theatrical runs, they somehow didn't come to be as well known as the rip offs. And more of Lloyd Kaufman's brilliance was made in 1983 (STUCK ON YOU and THE FIRST TURN-ON), but these much better titles also didn't reach the kind of audiences that later and even weaker Porky titles did.If you like the Porky films I am sure you will absolutely love the films that inspired these series, and suggest you check them out as well! All are available on DVD. From Troma,of course!"
3,"The original is awesome; the sequels are, well, sequels.",The original movie Porky's is a classic and still screamingly funny after all these years. The sequels are totally forgettable. You may want to consider just getting the single DVD of the original instead of the collection.
4,Porky's is always 'fresh'!!,"Although the third installment of 'Porky's' does not measure up to the original ""Porkys"" .... the set overall is a must-have for any fans of the story! The original is an absolute CLASSIC and is incredibly hilarious! The scenes with Kim Cattrall are an added BONUS as she is 3 parts GORGEOUS and 1 part hilarious in the gym scene ... a real HOWL! I would highly recommend this 3-DVD set to any 'lover of the Pork'!!!"
3,Better than PORKY's,"I'm one of the handful of people on earth who prefer this to the original. I think the comic timing is sharper and it is obvious they had more of a budget. Also, it tries to be about things. While the KKK and dirty politicians are obvious targets, I never get tired of seeing such characters get theirs. The scene in the restaurant with Wendy and Gebfart is hysterical. Perhaps Hollywood's most notable effort to bring Shakespeare to young movie audiences prior to 1996's ""Romeo & Juliet."""
2,nowhere near as good as the original,"Porky's 2 starts off the day after the first one ends.At first it's funny then it goes down hill from there.If you must see this movie I'd rent it,instead of buying it.The only reason I own it is because I've got the DVD where it has Porkys/Porky's 2."
5,Porky's Revenge a hot and sexy film,"So yeah one of my favorite scenes in porky's revenge is when the steaming hot cheerleaders trick the poor guys into a sex orgy that doesn't even happen. I love the part where the guys start stripping naked and jumping into the pool expecting the girls to jump in naked with them. Little did they know that the girls were watching the guys swim naked. It was so hot to see the girls laughing at them as each naked guy cam out of the pool one by one. I know I am not gay, but it is so damn hot to see a group of girls in their bikinis looking at naked guys coming out of the pool. I love the humiliation when the girl with the camera is actually filming them one by one. I love the fact that the guys didn't get what they came for. The girls lied to them and that is so hot and sexy. Such mean girls, but it turns me on that they're mean girls. I wish my girlfriend would do that to me and my guy friends SO HOT & HUMILIATING. he he he he he"
5,Porky's,I like these movies when I was young. So I watched them with my kids they just loved them. They could not quit laughing.
4,Slainte!,"Mike Scott has always seemed to follow his heart as opposed to the pocketbook in his musical releases. The guy can rock and play with the best of them...and he can really deliver on the low key. Never predictable, always literate and without being ""fake"" or ""hyped"". I like the CD and the more I listen it simply grabs you...not a knock over the head. Mike Scott and his Waterboys will always be relevant."
1,Universal Hall?(Where's the Bathroom?),"I want my money back. This is Mike Scott at his worst. The opening song and its ridiculous ooo-we-ooo chorus has got to be the worst song he has ever written. The rest of the album doesn't improve things any. I thought maybe Scott was on his way back with Rock in a Weary Land, even though that was pretentious and ponderous in places(What Waterboys album hasn't been?), but this is so lame. The unrelenting religious patter grates so badly(it makes me want to rethink eternity-if this is the kind of stuff coming out of speakers up there...)This release reinforces the fact that Fisherman's Blues was the only marginally great album from the Waterboys.This sounds like a side band playing at a revival for old 80's has beens. ooo-wee-ooo....What possessed the man to throw such a chorus into a song???(Oh, sorry. Possessed is probably the wrong word...) This is an embarrassing album.I do. I want my money back."
1,what happen?,"mike scott & the waterboys one of my top 5 all time bands since their first album.this album is so bad that makes me want to cry , all this time waiting for a new waterboys release and... this is it?i hope the next album gets back in track because this one was a total dissapointment.i just cant understand how a songwritter as genius as mike scott came up with this albumthis is not the sea ..not even a river ...."
3,Working good,It works fine but wasn't the right fitting for my particular carb! Therefore I had to make adjustments to make it fit properly
1,its a knock off,they tell u it has no problems with windows xp but it obvosly does i keep getting knocked off my net work and my comp is right next to the router. also my computer freezes at random now whenever im online i have to disable the network to get some things done then enable and do waht has to be done on the net. im very disatified with it but im looking for a way to fix it. ill post it up if i find it
3,Netgear WG311T 108 Mbps Wireless PCI Adapter,I can only get 54 Mbps max from a 108 Mbps rated adapter. No help from Netgear.
3,The technology isn't there yet,"I put this PCI card into my 900mhz AMD Atholon 256mb, and it crashed windows on its very first try. After spending 4 hours reinstalling windows xp it would crash and restart my computer every time.The product worked ok on my Dell Pentium IV 2.4ghz. Still I'd rather use a wired rather than wireless because the connection isn't very stable. I did keep the Netgearrouter WGT624, for my laptop which works pretty good, maybe because it's a pentium wireless card in there. But for the near futures I'll keep 3 of my desktops wired.Don't get this unless you absollutely have to."
2,Unreliable,"Very easy to install and setting up WEP security was easier than I anticipated. So...big bonus for that, which is why it got 2 stars instead of zero. Performance was fine, when it was working. Everything was peachy for about a week, then I began to randomly lose my internet connection. While this was likely the fault of the router, I thought I would post on this card as well. I also wired my pc through a Linksys 10/100 lan card, which also lost internet connection after working for a few days. The card and router could communicate, but the router and the modem would lose communication. I have a Zyxel prestige ADSL modem. Needless to say, I've returned my router and card and have purchased a 30 foot cable to run to my pc."
1,Do like system freezes in XP? Then buy this product!,I have a Netgear WG624 router which I am very pleased with. I bought this card because I was too lazy to run cat5 from my router downstairs to my second PC upstairs. I put it in at the same time I installed XP (was previously 2k). I experienced 1-2 second freezes about twice a minute where everything would stop and audio would stutter. Additionally the system would frequently lock up hard during mpeg play whether local or streaming and required holding the power buttont in to restart. Disabling the wg311t solved my problems. Search Google for wg311 and freeze. This is a common problem at least with XP. It's too late for me to return this adapter. Don't make the same mistake.
4,Works well with Linux,The WG311T that I recieved worked out of the box with Ubuntu Linux 6.06 LTS (provided I had network-manager-gnome installed). This card consistently receives a good signal and operates at 108mbps very far away from the gateway.The only reason I am giving this wireless card four stars is because many Windows XP users have had trouble with it.
1,This product doesn't work,"I bought a Netgear WG311T wireless card to replace one from another manufacturer that had failed. First, I coudln't get a connection to the router. Two conversations with tech support in India produced the information that I had to download a new driver for Windows XP-SP2 from the internet. I installed the new driver, which allowed me to connect to the router, but not reliably to the internet. A third attempt with tech support produced the suggestion that I change my web browser (I'm using IE!) Instead, I bought a Linksys card, which worked straight out of the box. Don't buy this product! If you're not convinced, go to the Netgear user forum and read the horror stories there."
3,Netgear software doesn't work with SP2!,"Important for SP2 users!The Netgear network connection software for the WG311T (even the lastest Aug '04 version posted on their website which was supposed to fix the SP2 problem) rarely, if ever, works. And if you choose to use the default Win XP SP2 wireless network connection software, it still won't work because even when the Netgear connection software is disabled, it interfers with the Windows XP software. You MUST stop the Netgear software from running at start-up and the only way to do this is according to instructions posted by J. Richmond here (thank you, Mr. Richmond!) After spending 2 hours on phone with Netgear support, I read his post and fixed it in 2 minutes. I actually told the support technician how to fix it. Now, why can't Netgear read the reviews of its own products!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY...,I was extremely disappointed in this Bible commentary. Not in the condition (I ordered a used one) but in the content. Many scriptures and even whole chapters have no commentary to them at all. They merely refer you to other parts of the Bible.
5,good gate,"this was my first walk thru gate and im pleased with it. we use it for our 5 dogs,ranging from small to medium. we use it to keep them out of the kitchen and they hate it especially when we are eating dinner,they are missing out on scraps. the walk thru is plenty for us."
4,Very easy to use,"Very easy to operate with one hand and fit perfectly in the archway between the living room/kitchen. Keeps the kid in, and the dog out!"
2,Had to Return,"Bought this gate with hopes to use it in our hallway to keep an inquisitive 1 year old away from the stairs. When we received it, the gate seemed well constructed and easy to assemble. We have a number of other gates throughout the house, so we are certainly not unfamiliar with how they go together and work.When we got it set up, no matter how we adjusted it, it would stick at the bottom corner of the swinging door to the bottom crossbar. I tried everything from preloading one side to try to tweak it so it would have more clearance, but it still had interference at the same point when tightened fully.I purchased it based on the positive reviews it received, and maybe I received a defective example. But it went back to Amazon and we went with another gate."
3,Ok gate,"I ordered this gate because I needed something to go across the top of my stairs. My stairway opening is 39 inches which is just slightly too big for an average gate (most cover openings up to 38 inches). This gate arrived and it was dinged up and dirty even in its original packaging. The extensions are ok, but my opening is just a hair too small for both extensions, but using the 6"" extension requires having the pegs screwed out almost the entire way which doesn't make the gate feel too sturdy (I can push it out of place, even with the cups installed, but my 3 year old and 1 year old can't). Over all it does the job, but loses points for appearance and for installation."
2,Unstable,"Pros: Very easy to install - you are done in 5-10 mins. Good height. Looks safe for the little fingers.Cons: The extension connections do not snap well. The whole door is bending front and back, not sure if it is going to hold on my toddler.This is the second Regalo easy step door that I am buying. I bought the shorter version (with one extension only) first and it worked perfectly. However, I need a door for a wider opening and bought this product with two extensions. The way the extensions are connected allows them the structure to bend. One connection works fine, but two of them makes the whole structure to bend front and back, no matter how tight you fasten the bolts. The other problem is that you cannot fasten the bolts beyond certain point without preventing the door from opening/closing."
1,Wrong product delivered.,"After ordering the Los Angeles Angels T-shirt, Amazon delivered a Texas Rangers t-shirt. They still show the picture for the Texas Rangers shirt, yet the description is the Los Angeles Angels. Amazon even charged me the shipping cost, even though I returned the product and requested a new one.Very unhappy customer"
5,The Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion (Oxford Paperback Reference),Exelent for the novise. Very recomendeble
4,"Great quality, color accuracy a little off","This vanity set is excellent quality construction, elegant, and actually larger than it looks in the pictures. Purchased for my 7 yr old daughter but even my 5'9"" wife can sit at the vanity comfortably. One complaint is that the color description says off-white but it is closer to a light taupe. Off-white is stretching the description unless their color control from product to product is not so good. Made in Vietnam."
5,Wonderful purchase,"I purchased this for my 17 year old daughter for Christmas. It says it is for children, but it fits her fine. It is a very pretty piece of furniture and was extremely easy to assemble. It is not a high end piece of furniture, but is very well made for what it is. It does not wobble and seems very sturdy. It does not take up a lot of room (which was a plus for us because of limited bedroom space). I was very pleased with the furniture and the vendor I purchased from. I highly recommend both. Thanks for a wonderful Amazon experience. If only they could all be that way!!!"
1,Damaged,"I bought this in March 2012. When we received it, it was damaged. The replacements were also damaged. It was replaced twice so all three vanities were damaged. It was the only gift my little girl got for her 5th birthday and she ended up with no gift at all. I will say that amazon was great about replacing it, but unfortunately they were not able to resolve the issue."
5,Vanity Table and Bench,I bought the table and chair for my mother for Christmas and she is very hard to please - she loved it - the perfect table and bench for her room - scalped table with an oval mirror in off white with a pink pillow seat cover on the bench -
5,For our little princess,This product was surprisingly good quality. It's made with real wood and all the components and construction was very good quality. There is significant assembly required but it's well worth the effort once its built. This furniture will last for years and will most-likely good for a good price once its ready for a yard sale.
3,cute but not good for kids,"I like this set. I bought it for my daughter's room. It looks adorable, but the chair was broken within a month or two. I tried gluing it several times, but finally gave up and threw it out. If you are buying this for kids (ages 7 & 8) it's not made very well in my experience."
4,"except for the color, love this vanity","The quality is great and I love the simplicity of the lines. I bought it formy granddaughter who enjoys it immensely but the color is off. It is anoff white and needs painting. That is the only disappointing thing. One ofthe leg was scratched and dented and a new one was sent out right awaywhich was greatly appreciated. Overall, great piece but do somethingabout the color."
4,Real Life On The Tour,"Though it now reads like a history of early '90's tennis, when this book first came out I pored over it with excitement to find out what the lives of my favorite players were like. All the big names of fifteen years ago are here: Sampras, Navratalova, Selles, Graf, Courier, Agassi, Fernandez, Vicario, McEnroe, Edberg and Lendl. Great champions all. This is set over the course of one full year on the circuit, from the Australian Open in January, to the end of season tournaments that follow the conclusion of the Grand Slam series at the US Open. Anyone who wants to learn about what it takes to compete at this level of tennis can get an education here. Also someone interested in the inner workings of the tour and the agencies that govern it can find out what they want to know. And although it seems odd to say this about one of the most influential books I read when I was so into this sport, it also serves today as the record of a long-ago year in the game of tennis."
5,Good glycerin,"Good stuff, pleasant sweet taste , put a drop into my mouth before going to sleep to avoid dryness in the mouth. No complains whatsover."
4,Very Good!,"It did what it was purchased for, i'd never used glycerin before so for a first time user i was pleased."
2,wrong product,i ordered the coconut glycerin as stated and got reg !!i already have this product now have to much..........
3,Just OK,Took a while to get it. The mounting hardware was wrong too. Price was right. Works with my old hardware. Well worth the price.
2,The Seven Laws of Teaching,"This is not the book that I thought it was, I needed for a class that I was teaching, but there are a lot of misspellings and it is inconsistent with the original ""Seven Laws of Teaching"" I am shipping this order back."
4,Kitchen Workhorse at a reasonable price,"This large non-stick saute pan is the workhorse of my kitchen. I needed (magnetic) stainless to go with my new induction cooktop and my only other real option was an All-Clad at $200+. I've used it a half-dozen times and so far the non-stick surface has lived up to its hype: very, very easy to clean and no sign of scratching or flaking. I'm happy with this Circulon Steel product and will probably buy more of this line."
3,Stooges!,"This is the budget edition, recorded on SLP (EP), the firstthing on the screen is ""Adjust your Tracking."" Talk aboutpre-emptive strike. Still it's a good value and the picture is decent. Whatdya expect for a 60-70 year old serial! Numbskull! 5 Stars for the Stooges, Zero Stars for the picture quality, AVG = 3"
4,Who knew life was so desperate in the country?,"Desperation, poverty, adultery, insanity, murder... they're all present and accounted for. Vintage country music is great stuff! An excellent collection from one of country music's unsung greats. Hipsters will love this..."
5,Doom gloom zoom boom doom the rubber roooooooom,"Man, I love me some Porter Wagoner. I don't know why they didn't use the cover of the original Rubber Room LP though. I suppose he looks a little more dignified on this cover. On the original he looks positively psycho.I used to stare at that album cover for hours on end."
2,disappointing ending,"The book was excellent. It kept me up at night, but the last 20 pages or so are disappointing. When I found out who the killer is, I wish I waited the next day to finish the book instead of suffering from sleep deprivation. But I still like the author's style of writing and I'd still read her other books."
3,"fun, forgettable entertainment","This was my first Lisa Gardner novel, and it was fun at times. Towards the end, this mystery/kidnapping novel was even almost a page turner. Though not realistic, I liked the main characters and cared about what happened. Too many seemingly unrelated subplots interfered with the pace of the story. It felt dragged out at times, but moved quickly at others. I know that I was supposed to feel something about the young boy Dougie, but he just did not sound like a seven year-old to me, and so I did not believe him enough to care too much. The main characters, Rainie, and her ex-FBI husband Quincy, are both good characters. I liked the sheriff, but didn't connect with many of the other people in this novel. This is a decent light weight mystery which went out of my head as soon as I was done. Partly, that's because the ending was a bit disappointing."
5,Gardner at her best!,Lisa Gardner is the absolute best at creating suspense. I adore all of her books.
4,Lots of suspense,"I really liked this book. It had lots of suspense with the kidnapping. I was really satisfied with how the story history was developed and the history of the characters without taking away from the present story. I liked the characters, but I had a hard time sympathizing with Rainie at times."
3,Good vacation read!,"This is a kidnapping/murder mystery with an FBI profiler as the main character. His wife has been kidnapped. I think the whole profiler idea has gotten a little tired on the whole, definitely overworked by the media. It gets to the point that you know what the profiler is going to say--white male in late 20's to early thirties with need for control and so on.I enjoyed this psychological suspense thriller. Of course, I have not read any other of Gardner's books so I don't have a basis of comparison. The plot was well devised and taughtly suspenseful. The characters were reasonably well drawn--I don't expect that much from a thriller but I wouldn't say they were cardboard.Overall--a good vacation read."
1,In the the good news department...,"...I am finished with this book. In the bad news department, I already bought two more books by this author and now am stuck with them.I supposed this will sound picky, but in this novel - and in the previous novel in this series - the author uses the terms ""in the good/bad news department"" so many times that it made me cringe. I couldn't enjoy the book because of it. She did this in a previous novel and I think seeing it again in this novel, so often and from so many points of view, just ruined the book for me."
4,Good mystery...,"I found GONE to be a enjoyable mystery to read. I'm not sure it's the best Gardner's written, but it shows that she can definitely craft a suspenseful story that can keep the reader guessing. I honestly did not have a clue as to ""who done it"" until it was revealed.I will mention one problem I did have with the book. It seemed unlikely that Rainie could suffer the injuries that she did, be going through withdrawal and still be able to carry a 7 year old child out of a flooding basement while her hands were bound. That all seemed so far fetched that it detracted a little bit from the story, but Gardner writes such great characters and plot twists that I was able to overlook that aspect. All in all a book worthy of a 4 star recommendation."
3,Slow,"I, like a few others reviewing this book, was disappointed. I have read most of Ms. Gardner's books and have enjoyed every one of them--greatly. They were ""all up all night and miss work the next day"" reads. Unfortuately, I found ""Gone"" to be much less exciting then her previous works. I found myself turning page after page to get to the meat of the story; and even after finding that meat at the end, I still found myself lacking. I acted like Billy Crystal in ""When Harry Met Sally"" and turned to the end just to see how ""Gone"" ended. Maybe in her next book, Ms. Gardner will find the old spark. I certainly hope so, because I do plan on buying it."
4,Good with a twist,"I am a huge fan of Lisa Gardner and thoroughly enjoy her books. Although I enjoy Rainie and Quincy, their story is getting a little tired. How many things can actually happen to these two? I would like to see more of Mac and Kimberly - maybe even a story with Candi as the lead character. She could really be developed into a great one! This storyline was good, but some things were not explained as fully as they could have been (such as what exactly was so bad at the crime scene that pushed Rainie to drinking again). The ending provided a good twist and Ms. Gardner did a good job keeping you guessing. Definitely worth your time to read."
3,Gone by Lisa Gardener,Gone is great. Lisa Gardener is quite the story teller. I have not read better books. She ranks as good as Lee Child in book.
5,Wow!,"I loved this book! I've read all of Lisa's books and this one is right up there. It takes some concentration because there's a lot going on and there are a lot of characters to keep track of, but it's well worth it. By the time you get to the middle of the book, there's no stopping! Things are happening and Lisa takes you with Rainie and Dougie, who have been abducted, with all the police, FBI, media, who are working to get them back, and all the while you're trying to guess the who-dunnit yourself! Maybe you'll be right - maybe you won't!A little tip - when there's lots of characters, I'll jot them down as I'm reading with a little about who they are. It helps keep me centered. Example = Shelly, sheriffQuincy, FBI"
5,GRRRRRRRREAT BOOK,STAYED UP ALL NIGHT READING THIS THRILLER. KEEP THOSE GOOD BOOKS COMING. I HAVE READ EVERY NOVEL BY LISA GARDNER AND LIKED THEM ALL!!!!!
3,INTENSE THRILLER,"This book kept me reading for two days almost non stop. An entire weekend flew by before I was relieved by a happy ending. This is a first read of Lisa Gardner for me. I never got a full reading on Rainie's character but totally understood her angst with her situation.I felt for me that I missed some in depth explanation of Rainie and Pierce's relationship. Perhaps I should go back a few books to familiarize myself with these characters. Quincy's daughter, Kimberly, was a delight as was Mac. These two have a future.Very exciting read."
3,Gone by Lisa Gardner,"Although the story kept moving, I did not care for the characters. They seemed to have a similar ""edge"" to their personalities. They were not believable. Furthermore I was bothered by the young boy Dougie, who was particulary disturbed. I did not find myself drawn to any characters. Therefore, I would not read another Gardner book again."
4,Really should have been 3. 5stars!,"I think first of all i have to say that i absolutely love lisa gardner. She is definitely one of my favorite authors. I can honestly say there is no one quite like her (except maybe for tess gerristen and karen rose). But this book wasn't her best. I didnt go into depth about the characters background,had too many points of views of the secondary characaters working the case, and when i found out who the culprit was, (the culprit is this book was definitely generic, i have read a michael connelly book who used this same kind of person), anyways i was like huh?? But still it was a good book, but just not as suspensful as her other books like the next accident and the survivor's club. Nevertheless i will still read her new books and encourage everyone to read her previous books because those are worth five stars!"
2,Just couldn't get into it,"I've tried several times to read this book and just can't get into it. I've liked Lisa Gardner's other books and had high hopes for this one. I don't know how far I've read into it so far... kept pushing hoping I would hit the point that the story hooked me, but no such luck. Looking forward to the next one... hopefully this was just a one-time miss for me."
4,I don't know how I missed Lisa Gardner in the past...,"... but I did. Reading this book prompted me to order all her previous works from Amazon; that's how highly I thought of this book. Evidently this is the third outing for Rainie, Quincy, Kimberly, et al -- I'm certainly looking forward to catching up with them when my order arrives.I found the story line engaging and imaginative; more importantly, so were the characters. They're sympathetic and believable, complex like real people; they all have their demons, which they try to conquer with varying degrees of success.Gardner's sense of locale, and ability to convey it, is very gifted; you can almost feel the mud of the Pacific Northwest squishing under the soles of your boots.Further, I found the ending to be a surprise in that I hadn't figured out who the bad guy was -- that's a good thing in a ""whodunnit"" novel.I strongly recommend this book."
5,Best book in the series,"""Gone"" by Lisa Gardner was an amazing book. It's even better if you have read the books before this that are in the series. Lisa Gardner does such a wonderful job at hiding the culprit. I swear there were 3 different people I thought it was, I get to the end and I was totally wrong. She is an amazing author and I can't wait to start her other series. I highly recommend reading this. The order of the books in the F.B.I Profiler Quincy series are as follows,1. The Perfect Husband2. The Third Victim3. The Next Accident4. The Killing Hour5. Gone6. Say Goodbye.Out of all of these, ""Gone"" was truly my favorite. Hope you enjoy it as well."
4,great read,"I enjoy Lisa Gardner's books. Exciting, interesting characters and towards the end you actually cannot put the book down until you find out what happens. Sorry this is a short review but I am using my Kindle's miserable little keyboard and this is about all I can manage. Just get this book. you will enjoy it."
3,Not as Good as Others,"Lisa Gardner's books are superb thrillers, but this one wasn't quite up to par. Without the dynamic between Quincy and Rainie, something seemed missing.... and it lessened the impact of the book."
3,Gone,Iwas disappointed with this book. I waited a year for this book to come out and it is not Lisa Gadners best book. Lisa is still one of the best writers . This book is just not what i expect from her . Not enough twist and turns for me .
3,Gone to this well once to much!,"I love Lisa Gardner's writing and have followed these characters through her previous books dealing with them and have enjoyed those well written stories. I feel that this time she has returned to them once to often. How many bad things can happen to one family? I don't know if she was in a hurry to get another book out for her publisher or what; but it is time to develop some new characters and let Quincy rest in peace. This was definitely her weakest written book. I look forward to her next book and hope it will be more on the order of ""The Other Daughter"", ""The Perfect Husband"" or ""The Survivor's Club"" - all of which were truly fascinating and original."
4,What a beginning! Where's the ending?,"It is ironic that both Jonathan Kellerman and Lisa Gardner came out with murder mysteries titled ""Gone"" this year. Gardner's is appropriately titled, while Kellerman's is not. Gone is the operative word in this novel... people are disappearing without a clue, then the reason becomes apparent... kidnapping. Or is it something more?The mystery is intense and engaging. The ending is... disappointing, and out of the blue. What is this... a mystery is supposed to be good if at the last second a bozo you never dream of ends up being the perp? There has to be a better reason for developing a bad guy than ""I knew you wouldn't guess this.""Riveting scenes of attempted escape from a deranged kidnapper. A great search for the victims. It's the ending that pulls my hair out.Four stars for 4/5 of a novel."
2,Steady Plot,"This is the first book I have read of hers, I can say that the plot was steady,But I felt a little bored, The ending wasnt as surprising as I had hoped, But it was okay..Not one of the best books I have read lately!"
2,Walker 15284C Carburetor Kit,"Watch the bottom gasket in this kit . It does not have the idle holes in it, so I had to use the old gasked. After rebuild, the car wouldn't idle. It can't when no gas can get through. it took me a while to figure that one out, so I hope this helps someone else."
5,best sho ever,FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY taugh your Arse offi have all seasons and wach them 1-3 times a year on av. ive see each episode at least 10+ times and its still funny
1,FOR MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT VERSION ONLY,"Let me start by saying i love amazon and i love this show, but when you buy mill creek entertainment dvds, you get what you pay for. I bought this entire series in the mill creek version and over half of the discs FOR THE ENTIRE SERIES were scratched to the point where one or more of episodes skipped. Some even caused the dvd player to lock up and take me straight to the menu, and these came BRAND NEW FACTORY SEALED from amazon. And no, i dont have a cheap dvd player, its a brand new Sony blu-ray/dvd player that i have zero trouble with. I am assuming the reason behind so many scratched dvds is the fact that all the discs are put in little cheesy paper sleeves. I would stay away from the entire mill creek product line as they package their dvds in paper sleeves, guarentee them to scratch."
5,Best Comedy,Husband and grand daughter love to watch this old program. She watched them during the summer on vacation with us.
5,Good stuff!!,"I am a huge John Lithgow fan so I had to have this season of Third Rock From The Sun in my DVD collection. The American Medical Association did a study that if you laugh for 20-30 minutes before bedtime, you will have a good night's sleep. Thank you for helping me with my pursuit of wellness and good health with this box of laughs."
4,funny and fun,This was the best network comedy of the 90's aside from Seinfeld. Why it's not in syndication is beyond me.
5,As funny as the 1st time,"I was so glad to get this set on a gold box special-I'd forgotten how funny, witty, well written/acted, and wonderfully entertaining the show had originally been. Since I am not a TV show aficionado, having some minutes cut out does not impact me as I simply do not recall the episodes in their entirety. Maybe if like some I had old VCR tapes to compare, then I might feel differently. I just know when I've had a challenging work day if I watch an episode or two, I laugh out loud and feel much happier. This is a definite cost effective stress reducer. I plan to get the entire set as they too slowly go on sale."
5,The Big Giant Head!? The Big Giant Head is HERE!?,"Another hilarious season put out by your favorite dysfunctional alien family.This set includes all 22 episodes from season 5, and on the case they claim to be uncut, however I am skeptical. Tommy graduates High School, The Big Giant Head and Vicki return, with a startling revelation, Harry is High Commander of Holes, and Sally, Harry and Tommy orchestrate a plan to rob a bank; sadly the pens are chained down. There is one episode I think has been cut a bit from what I remember, but I could be wrong.Quality and sound perfect once again, and the collectible booklet is at the same level of quality we've come to expect. Bloopers are not nearly as good as the last few season selections along with fewer extras.All in all a great addition to you DVD collection, with this season there is only one season left. Add this one to your collection and sing along, Something Something SPACESHIP!!"
1,Very much a waste of time!,This is a book with 90% of the page blank. I would not put my name on something like this and charge!Sorry but TRUTH!Don't waste your time and valuable resourses.
2,For those who like this kind of book...,"If you think you'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting, then you'll enjoy this book."
2,Hmm,"Ths series is a battle for me. I hate myself for wasting the hour it takes to read each "" diary,"" but I find it so hard to stop. There are so many cliff hangers, it practicly forces you to buy the next book. On volume 4, I revolted, and refused to buy the new book...for a whole day.I found myself twitching, wondering"" Will Jonah and Molly get it on?"""" Will Jonah ever figure out who Northgirl is?"""" Will Jonah answer Sophie's call for help?""and other world altering questions. See book four for answers!All in all, I didn't really like this book, but if you've read book 1 and 2, you don't really have a choice...now do you."
2,"run, jonah, run","I do not recommend this book. Reading it was almost a necessity due to the momentous nature of Vol. II. The story lacked activity. Jonah seemed to be reflecting on a few events for an awfully long time, while at the same time reflecting on his personality. I felt like I was stuck in his head for so long I couldn't think clearly. Some of the coincidental events in the book seemed too fantastic. The sex, drug use, and the drinking and driving scene were excessive. I would almost characterize the book as a trashy romance novel, for men, with no follow through. Jonah is not an age appropriate role model. In the previous books he is though. It seems as though the book was hastily written to keep the reader's mouth wet. The inconclusiveness of the book leads me to believe that the quality of the writing is being sacrificied simply to make fast money."
4,More from the world of Jonah Black,Jonah is back again this time he excited and nervous because he finally going to get to see Sophie in person and get to hang out with her.Even though he knows he cares about Sophie he is still with Posie and cares about her alot. But as Jonah's bad luck kicks in he screws up with Posie and they end up breaking up.Jonah is still trying to figure out who NorthGirl999 is. And he is also trying to figure out how to get down to Orlando to see Sophie. But an e-mail to him warns him of Sophie.Jonah makes it down to Orlando only to find that things are going to go the way he planned and he isn't happy about it. With all the bumps in the road Jonah still manages to find some happiness in life.I hope in the next book we finally find out who NorthGirl999 is and what wrong with Sophie.
4,Not really what it seems,"the movie was good and very imformative on how law enforcement is. I recommend it to anyone thinking of wanting to go into a career of law enforcement. Like myself, I will always keep this close when I need to get more direct info on my future profession."
5,Must Be Heard to Be Believed,"Try to imagine some generic, cheesy Latin lounge music. Got it? Now try taking Kraftwerk's ""Showroom Dummies"" and cramming it into that genre. Got it? No? Then you have to listen to this album. In fact, you can listen to Señor Coconut's version of ""Showroom Dummies"" and a few of the others tracks from this album, since the band's made them available on the internet (just type ""Señor Coconut showroom dummies"" into Google, and you'll find it). I highly recommend it. Because, even though this is pretty much a gimmick, the music is still rather enjoyable. Rather very enjoyable."
4,Pet Fun Run,"The fun run is good if you have small pets (cats or small dogs)...My cat doesn't care too much for it, but it's a compromise since I live in a townhome community and she likes to be outside. I would suggest if you have the space to buy at least two to expand it or the elbow joint and another one to try and make it fun. Otherwise the cat just kind of sits there, and may or may not roll it around if they get bored. It can be compacted which is good, and is very lightweight and durable. Overall, for my purposes I would purchase it again..."
3,Depending on your cat this can be great,"The item arrived promptly and exactly as described, so seller was great.I was very excited with the product but my cat (oy) is sort of afraid in it; she doesn't get it, but then she is 'special'. I have not given up and place her in there but then she just sits there waiting to be taken out. She does not run up and down in it, or anything. But your cat might...."
4,"Fun, futuristic speculation from the late 1960's","This big, sprawling novel is essentially a sci-fi spy thriller, but the real star of the show is the whacky world of the future in which the whole story takes place. Written in the late `60's, Brunner employs lots of technical fireworks to bring that future world to life. Many readers will find this annoying and almost incomprehensible at first, but after a hundred pages or so, the main plot emerges and the book finally takes off. Brunner really knows violence, and seems to know a lot about cloning as well, for the period. Hip, funny, and sardonic all at the same time, one wonders how much influence this book had on the emergence of cyberpunk 10 years later. Still, it would've been tempting to cut several of the multitudinous subplots in order to move things along a bit faster."
3,Takes place in 2010 in an over populated world,"Interesting to read a book that takes place this year with one President of a small African country with a name uncannily similar to the current US President! Be that as it may, this is a tough read until you grasp that much of the content is simply there to set the stage for this society where population numbers are extreme and drugs are there for everyone and for every ailment and cloning is a possibility. Although written in the sixties, much is valid today and the ideas and predictions do resonate somewhat (advertising is everywhere, for instance). The plot is scattered among all the little chapters that provide context, and this is somewhat irritating, although the writing does hold one's interest. Only read if you like Brunner in general and have the time to devote to this work!"
2,Dated,"The style is very dated, if you picked up this book and read a page you could guess to within 5 years when it was written. As for the plot, interesting but totally off in its predictions. The early 1970s saw a kind of hysteria sweep through the environmentalist movement. People feared overpopulation. Stand on Zanzibar was one of the works that benefited from this and at the same time fed off of it. Of course it was wrong in it's predictions and projections."
1,Enduring,A kind of experimental writing I found difficult to cope with. I finished the book by skipping irrelevant chapters and sticking to the couple of related stories moving on in parallel. I came out of the book unsatisfied. All those words for what?
1,A book about the sixties,"Science fiction about the future is a window onto the era it was written in. ""Stand on Zanzibar"" is about the anxieties of the 1960's- overpopulation, crime and chaos. Science fiction from our era is dominated with anxiety about the environment and global warming. Usually these anxieties prove to be unfounded, but they do tell us about what people were worried about. ""Zanzibar"" is a creature of the sixties, and if you haven't lived through that decade, you'll feel like you have by the end of the book. William Gibson writes about the same sort of future mess, and does a much better job."
4,An incredible exercise in world-building...,"There are few novels in sf that give you a more three-dimensional picture of the future [or the present, actually]... Brunner's wealth of detail about the overpopulated, media-obsessed, computerized world of 2010 [from the vantage of 1968, a true time of crisis] is spectacularly and forbodingly realized. The plot and characters are a bit dated, but grew on me as we went along... Brunner's 2010 is not a nice place, but it's worse than we actually got -- though not by a lot in many cases. If we hadn't gotten better at feeding people than he thought we might, it could well have been that bad. If you love world-building, this is an experience you owe yourself."
1,product review,"I had to send this product back for an exchange, for one the product is different then her orginal exercise shorts that I ordered many years ago when they were new to her product line. The size chart was way off. I ordered a large according to the sizing chart. they were way to big and now I have to wait for an exchange,I hope the next pair fits cause I hate to pay for shipping again and again.."
2,Whoa .. Way Too Hot!,"Although the overall fit is comfortable, after wearing these shorts twice I found that I could not take how hot they were to exercise in. I am giving mine away."
2,Wrong Specifications.,I got them today and back they go today! This item size chart is totally wrong base on measurements given!! I just got 2 pairs that I bought a few days back and I bought two since I am on a diet and I want to have an extra pair for after I loose the weight. Neither one fit. I am going to return them today. They will have a lot of returns if they don't change those charts. I hope they are not measuring cows instead of women to take the measurements. What a waste of your clients time. Back you go!
3,makes noise when you walk,"The shorts fit comfortably, however, with the material that it is constructed from, it made a sound as I walked. The material was rubbing between my thighs and making a ""swishing"" sound. THat can be quite annoying with every step one takes."
2,Tasco Essentials 10-30X50 Binoculars,"This is a cheap product, so not much can be expected. Optics are poor, and even in tropical sunlight (I am using them in Cartagena, Colombia) images are dull with little resolution.The zoom function does not permit a smooth transition when it is being adjusted.My recommendation to prospective buyers is to spend more for better quality zoom binoculars, or to stick with fixed 7 X 50 or 10 X 50 models and invest in better optics.More care needs to be taken with the packing - my binoculars arrived with one of the object lens tubes bent out of its mounting on the prism case. Fortunately the threads were only slightly deformed and I was able to re-assemble the binicoulars satisfactorily."
3,MAC,"Works good at 10X,but the more zoom you use the harder it is to focus.At 30X almost impossible to focus."
2,Sticky zoom,I was excited to get my new binoculars (I had an equivalent Tasco zip zoom that was about 18 years old that was stolen). When I received the new pair in the mail I was disappointed that the zip focus was jerky and impossible to use without it jerking the camera around. Sent it back. Will be looking for another brand.
5,Great race track set!,"Bought this for my 8 year old - worthy of the great reviews! It is durable yet easy to use. The connectors make the track sturdy through many uses. My son was able to put the track together using many configurations on his own - twists and turns down-low and up-high. Has enough variety in the tracks to make many different track sets. MUCH better than hot wheels - we've always found hot wheels to come apart so easily and quickly, making it very frustrating for the kids. One recommendation is to get the Darda Ultra-Speed type of car because the other models may not have enough speed to get through all the loops. All my children are enjoying this toy!"
3,Thought it would be better; sharp edges,"For years I couldn't wait until my child was old enough to enjoy this toy and its educational value. Finally last week we bought the set and I've concluded that it's not all I expected it to be for several reasons:1. The edges of the tracks, loops, baseplates, stacking bridges, etc. are very sharp, especially considering the amount of pressure needed to get them together. I had to cover my hands with a cloth so as not to hurt them from the sharpness. There's no way my son (5) can put some of these pieces together, both from a strenth-needed standpoint and the sharpness.2. Some of the loops indicated in the instructions are too curved for the cars to stay on them. The basic loops are fine.3. As others have said, there is no way to put all the pieces back in original container.That said, I do like that the options are endless, the cars have great speed and there are no batteries involved."
2,not too impressed so far,"We ordered this set for our 4 year old son for Christmas. For the money we paid for it, I have yet to be impressed. He was so excited about it but we couldn't get to go around the few track configurations we tried. They went around maybe once at the most then just fell down. One of the cars no longer works. The flexible tracks don't fit in the grooves without forcing it in. We bought this based on the good reviews, should have listened to the negative review. Can't say I would recommend this one."
2,Not worth the money,"We purchased this last Christmas (owned for 8 months now). The track connectors broke after assembling only three different configurations. The cars do not travel the full length of several of the recommended track designs and the cars wear out fairly quickly. We can't build all suggested designs due to faulty parts and they are very difficult to assemble for anybody under 6 years of age. We have replaced two cars due to the wind-up no longer functioning and at $10 a piece for car or replacement engine, that's ridiculous. When they work they are fun, but if you can find a cheaper alternative, such as mega blocks or matchbox tracks that work with all cars, go with it. Darda is glossy cool on the surface, but not worth the money at all."
5,Darda,Darda is an excellent company with quality toys. My son loves the cars and the tracks. This set was great because he could build whatever he wanted and it has enough parts although having a few more of the clear clips would be helpful.
3,Just minor easy manufacture improvements needed.,"Length:: 0:22 MinsSo here's the deal, if I would have rated it 5 stars then it wouldn't matter what flaws I state, so listen up Darda!1. Make the box bigger...it's a very nice built plastic box, why ruin its utility and make it so small...it's either heading to the street for garbage pickup OR it's going to store some other toy(s).2. Add more track connectors.Yep, that's it, do these two simple things and you product would shine! If these improvements were executed by the manufacture and I received a package with these 2 improvements then I would have rated 5 of 5 stars.Thank you!"
4,good bait,I used the bait for salt water flats fishing in Florida. Worked real good for trout and ladyfish. A nice soft bait but just a little too soft for the teeth of saltwater fish.
5,Great Cable,"For the price, this product is great. With shipping my total came to about $7. The shipment came in a couple of days and even included the drivers on CD-ROM. I highly recommend this for the phone models listed."
1,Not a data cable for VX3400,"This cable is a plain USB cable. It does not work for syncing the address book of a VX3400 (or VX3450) with a PC or Mac using Bitpim or OnSync. For $20 + shipping, I was able to get a Future Dial USB serial cable model 60 that worked with OnSync on my Mac. See [...]When the Bitpim site says ""DO NOT PURCHASE A STRAIGHT USB CABLE"", they're referring to products such as the USB Data Cable on this Amazon page. The alternative is a serial USB cable, that has some electronics in it to convert between a serial interface and USB. The Future Dial model 60 is a serial cable. It confusing because both cables are USB at one end and the LG phone connector at the other. You can't tell them apart by looking at their connectors."
3,MATH CAD FOR STUDENT APLICATIONS,THIS BOOK IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE HELPS YOU TO SOLVE DIFFERENT PROBLEMS ABOUT MATH
1,design flaw on clasp,". I love citizen eco drive watches.They are usually so painlessly carefree. This model, however, is not a good pick!. If you need the band sized,as I did, the band now fits perfectly, but to unclasp the watch, you have to reach inside between watch and wrist to manuever the deployment clasp.It's next to impossible.I understand the reason... the band then looks like it's all one piece. it's just not worth the trouble. I literally had to stick a pointed object under the watch to get it to release. A sharp, pointed object near your radial artery is just never a good idea. Think twice here."
2,Face color looks very different,"The face color looks white in the photo but is actually grey and purple.Also, the watch looks much cheaper than in the photo, and diamonds are very small.So, I sent it back. The refund was prompt."
5,Glad but not happy,"The product itself is great. Ergo the 5 star rating. However, I was pretty comfortable that this would be the case before I ordered it online. I had seen a similar product in a ""warefouse"" (Sam's Club), but it wasn't the color I wanted. I have sense found it at Costco, $30 cheaper that what I paid. That's the basis of my unhappiness. It was not only the product that I was shopping for, but the price also. Sorry, Amazon, but you didn't fulfill my expectations!"
5,Wonderful Watch,I have had this watch for about 5 years and still get compliments on it. I will go through stages of not wearing it and it has always had the correct time when I take it out of my jewlery box. I have three young kids and teach first grade.This watch has no scratches on the crystal and minor scratches on the band that no one has every seemed to notice. All diamonds are still in place. I am thinking about adding another watch to this one-I will probably get the same style with the black two tone because I can not imagine liking another watch as much as this one.
4,Smoky blend of folk and blues,"On this lost classic Hardin returns to his roots with a smoky jazzy vocal delivery, supported by guitar, keyboards, bass, drums, percussion, vibes, cello, harp and pedal steel.Leonard Cohen's title track and songs like the cover of Satisfied Mind and his own composition Hoboin' display a poignant sense of longing.More than a dozen folk and jazz musicians worked on this album, but keyboardist Joe Zawinul and guitarist Ralph Towner deserve special accolades for their instrumental virtuosity that subtly and successfully integrates Hardin's various stylistic influences.As a romantic musical poet, Hardin was unique in that he straddled the fields of folk and blues. His symbolic imagery and haunting vocals remind me somewhat of that other tragic singer-songwriter, the great Nick Drake.I also recommend the albums Reason To Believe:The Best Of, and The Essential Classic Hardin, 1963 - 1980."
1,Insanely stupid,"Am I crazy or is this the *hittiest television show ever? The writers are apparently stoned ghetto idiots with no sense of wit or humor. Apparently the viewer has to be stoned with a case of munchies to appreciate humor from a shake,a meatball, and some fries. Dont get me wrong I love adult cartoon humor (Furturama, Family Guy, Harvey birdman, Space Ghost and even Beavis and Butthead). This is just not funny after one episode- if youve seen one episode youve pretty much seen em all."
5,Best of all the seasons!,"Hilarious cartoon overall, but this season is the best as far as I'm concerned. More hits than misses per episode. Some of the best one-liners in my mental bank of funny quotes. If you like adult swim cartoons this is one of the best!"
5,"OH YEAH, WE JIGG-LIN' NOW!","I don't usually buy TV DVD's unless it happens to be stuff that can't be seen on TV.There are maybe a few I would like to get. For a few years I didn't have cable TV and it didn't really bother me in the slightest, but then I realized I was missing out on this weekly 12 minute cartoon every Sunday. Rather than pay a thousand dollars a month for cable I went out and got this DVD. ITS HILLARIOUS! Although, you can't watch them all at once. You have to experience each cartoon one at a time. Maybe watch one a day, or one a week, or just whenever you are in need of some sideways insanity. I've gotten the other two since and I am psyched to see that there is now a fourth.Check out the one with the rainbow machine or the one with the super happy action figures, and I think you will be a fan!"
5,Adult Swim Classic,"The show is the story of the Aqua Teens:Frylock,Shake,& Meatwad.Frylock is what holds everyone together while Shake and Meatwad get into trouble.When the do get in trouble it usually irritates Carl,there next door neighbor,who gets things done to him that is unimaginable.Meatwad is my favorite,he has the innocence of a child and the language of an adult.He has some great one liners.Shake is the one trying to do things against what Frylock says or trying to get Meatwad in trouble.Also,look out for the Mooninites who pop in every once in a while and in my opinion make the best episodes.This set has a few extras and it is reasonably priced.You can breeze through this set on a rainy day and I fully reccomend it."
4,One of my guilty pleasures,"For some reason, I'd never heard of this show until it was recommended in my Netflix list. It's downright hilarious and a lot of the comedy is subversive, which is right up my alley. I won't call it smart, because that would make me stupid. (Note: just because the fan base for your favorite tv show is small, doesn't make you a genius or in the possession of anything spectacular). The situations are outrageous and the shake character has......issues. So, even though I haven't bought the DVD from Amazon, I have rented it, so that's what I'm reviewing. The show itself. If you're purchasing the DVD, you might want to find a review specifically referencing the packaging you'll get when you purchase it."
4,This Show is Hilarious,"Aqua Teen Hunger Force is one great show. Its original and very clever, I mean who else would have thought of making a show about a milkshake, a box of fries and a wad of meat. The show is basically about the 3 foods named Master Shake, Frylock and Meatwad and they either chill out at their house in Jersey Shore or are trying to figure something out that is causing mischief aroung thier town. But anyway this sho is extremely funny I would definitely rocommend this to any fan of [adult swim] or if your a fan of random type humor. This is a must buy product."
5,LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!,"Great show! not everyone's kinda flavor/style of comedy, but if your into very sarcastic comedy and can accept a different kind of visual appeal, WATCH THIS!!!"
5,Aqua Teen Hunger Force Great Show!,another great show from adult swim. this being one of the first shows they ever did and this is the first season. this season isnt as bad as season four though anyways not the point if you like adult swim buy this dvd
1,Totally weak!!,"Totally weak! ATHF is a great series but the DVD collection adds NOTHING to the series as it originally aired. The extras are totally lame and even the expletives that were bleeped in the broadcast versions were bleeped on the DVD collection. What the #%*& is that all about? Do yourself a favor, tape the series off air and save yourself some money."
2,no laughs,"OK, it is clever in one sense--the characters have interesting quirks but after you watch one episode, they are all the same. I prefer homestarrunner.com for weird humor of this ilk with better wacked-out writing. Aqua Teen Hunger Force is basically a one-trick pony.The only funny characters I dug were episodes where the video game-like Mooninites showed up.The humor was like bad Shecky Greene and the animation tries to be sort of Terry Gilliam Python-like but just looks too Hanna Barbera flat and ultra '60s.Disappointing after reading the reviews here."
5,AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE ROCKS,This DVD ia awesome. Buy it now. Carl alone is reason enough to buy this DVD.
4,Perfect... Almost,"First off, I have to agree with everyone here that this is an amzing work of animation. If you like King of the Hill, the Simpsons, Futurama, Family Guy, and South Park, then you will love this as much, if not more. Instead of droning on and on about how good it is I would like to point out the biggest disappointment of the DVD. If you're anything like me, you enjoy the commentaries very much. Matt Groening and many others did commentaries on every Simpsons and Futurama DVD that has been released. Unfortunately, We get three lousy commentaries here from the creators. They spend more time watching the show along with you than explaining anything. In another they play a long, crappy song, except however for the BAD ASS GUITAR SOLO supposedly done by Dave Willis. Overlooking that fact, I must say the DVD is still a must have as will be the much anticipated future volumes."
4,Too much of a good thing...,"The two discs hold the first season of the adventures of Master Shake, Frylock and Meatwad, three creatures who live in a run down house near the Jersey shore. They make up Aqua Teen Hunger Force, a force of good, a force trying to deal with alien invasions, monsters, robots, rainbows, cloning machines, talking dolls, money, mold and other weird events that seem to happen on their street. Love the opening theme song.The DVDs have three commentaries and a few extras. My only problem is that I tried to watch every episode in one day and it seems that was a mistake. Watching it all at once seems to take some of the humor out of it. It got less funny after each episode. I would suggest keeping it down to one episode per day and maybe taking some kind of booze with it along with large amounts of some kind of salty snacks."
4,Gentlemen BEHOLD!!!!!,"Aqua Teen Hunger Force is the funniest cartoon I have seen in years. In my opinion it eclipses South Park in sheer bizzareness. This DVD is worth getting just for the beginnings of the episodes featuring Dr. Weird. You'll find yourself saying ""What did I just see?!?!? Did he just say that?!?!"" Like the liner says on Adult Swim, it will whet your appetite for crazy as hell!"
5,ATHF- volume 1,"The second ATHF volume I have bought for my husband (the first was volume 4)- definitely not to be the last! I thought that talking animated food items that are said to fight crime (but actually do not) would be insanely stupid- I was wrong! I bought it to make my husband happy and now, I watch them just as much. This is one of the funniest 'adult' cartoons ever made- albeit sometimes disturbing. Anyone who has an open mind, a sense of humor and a love of cartoons that are crass- to say the least- will love ATHF."
5,"Boy, oh boy I sure hope it's a new mommy...","Yeah, it's not. Aqua Teen Hunger Force is a strange breed of comedy that is both uplifting and entertaining, the only disappointment is that each episode is only about 12 minutes long. I don't know that they could pull of anything longer than that, but I'm still longing for more once the show is over. But anyway, the key to Aqua Teen Hunger Force is that you've got to boil it, until the glue gets soft."
3,Entertaining,"Not up there with the Simpson's or Family Guy in theanimated features, as I have not been able to sit andwatch back to back to back episodes. Not my best purchasebut obviously has its fans and is different."
3,Strange cartoon,"I enjoyed this cartoon. At times its hilarious and others just strange. I think if you like taking drugs and putting something like this on while you freak out, highly recommended.The ideas that come out in this cartoon are insane at time, but then again its what I love about it."
4,Where's My Whiskey? Im Gonna Get Tore Up,"The first 13 episodes of Aqua Teen Hunger Force contained on two disks hold up amazingly well, many times, the beginning episodes of a series will be a little rougher, not so with aqua teen, chances are you have seen the show on cartoon network's adult swim, and you either love it or hate it, if you love it, you cant go wrong with this dvd set."
3,"Sorry, didn't do much for me",I'm afraid I didn't find this show very entertaining. I'm a big fan of many animated TV shows. This one didn't do it for me in almost any way.
2,Rich and Famous,I want to know the Rich and Famous it is including the mandarin languages. Is audio track has Chinese(Mandarin).
1,Highly Recommended. Breathable material.,"These sun protective gloves are great and I highly recommend them. Very breathable material made of nylon and spandex. Inseams look sturdy, however I'll probably hand wash them. I ordered these sun protection gloves for driving and walking to stop further development of age spots on the backs of my hands. I ordered S/M size and they are snug. They fit easily into a pocket or purse."
4,Very Interesting Read,"This is a collection of the most newsworthy events that happened every year from 1900 to 1999, with two to eight pages devoted to each year. It's an interesting survey, and if you read it chronologically it's fascinating to see the events of the century unfold. Even the most famous events are surprising, in a way, in this greater context.This is a book you can read a couple of pages at a time, or in large chunks such as on a long trip. It reads almost like a newspaper, but if it has a fault, it's that like newspapers, it has some inaccuracies (e.g., it states that the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area occurred on October 19th and killed 273 people, when in fact the quake happened on October 17th and killed 62). I only caught that because I lived through that event, but it made me wonder if there were any errors which I didn't notice.Still, it's worth reading as sort of a refresher course in modern world history."
3,Cute and funny,"Cute, funny, and okay for the rental price. I wouldn't rate it as strongly as many of the other reviews, but it's definitely better than so many cheesy romantic comedies."
4,ONE HELL OF A MOVIE,"I AM 50 YEARS OLD AND JUST A REG GUY. LOVE space movies and u no guys flicks,but I tell you what' this is a great movie. Ya boy JUSTIN SHOWS JUST HOW GOOD HE IS AND IS A VERY GIFTED ACTOR. GOT TO WATCH THIS ONE.."
5,so funny,love it always have to get everything with justin timberlake in it so funny its a really good movie.. we tell everybody to watch it
4,A classic for sure,I really like this movie. It was endearing and just your basic romantic comedy. Timberlake was charming and believable while Kunis is hot and spunky. What's not to love?
3,scenens cut,"I was disappointed to find that some scenes had been cut from the original movie. This is not what I expected. At one time a movie DVD also contained ""Bonus"" scenes or extras. I guess now that is a thing of the past. All in all the movie is good but not complete. When the DVD is not complete it should be noted in the Product Description."
4,Yup an Okay Good Movie,"Only because of the Actors who take a long time to get together but they do great nad not to bad script. Twenties examined. Both are dating others but are drawn to each other at the End. Can't believe it is Okay movie I bought,. Top Notch script and they acted very well."
4,Love this movie!!!,"This movie came promptly and I opened it and watched it right away. The dvd was in great shape and I haven't had a problem with it yet. Also, this movie is laugh out loud funny and super cute. WARNING: This is a gay best friend and best girlfriend movie. Not for straight red blooded males"
2,20-something wasteland,"If you were 18 when the first Harry Potter movie came out (as Justin Timerlake's character claims to have been), you might be able to relate to this movie...if you are also emotionally shallow and think the world revolves around your feelings. Otherwise, you will probably find it to be predictable, trite, slow-moving, and just plain silly. Its only redeeming quality is that its overarching message focuses on the importance of starting romantic relationships as a strong friendship.Oh, and be prepared to watch Kunis and Timberlake have sex about 500 times. While both of these people are attractive enough, after awhile, it just gets plain tedious."
2,Friends with benefits,"Justin Timberlake was mildly entertaining at the beginning but the dialog degenerated and the movie felt forced and not believable. Liked him a lot more in the Social Network, but that was a compelling story. This was just boring."
2,"Yabba, yabba, yabba","I guess these two are likeable enough but the film is so talky that 23 minutes in, I had to shut it off. Boring. Talk. Talk. Not a guy's movie at all.On the other hand my wife enjoyed it, so that just shows you."
2,Stay away,"Very slow, predictable.. Not worth my time. I thought this would be funny but really, not so much. My husband couldn't keep his eyes open until the end of this film."
2,A Study in Mediocrity,"This film was boring and had nothing to even make me giggle no less laugh. Not even the obvious attractiveness of Miss Kunis did anything to enhance my enjoyment of this ""dog""."
5,Surprising!,"I really thought this was going to be a stupid movie. Bored the other night, I decided to watch it whilst working on jewelry. I ended up setting my project aside because I really started to enjoy the movie.Surprise for me was the chemistry between Timberlake & Kunis. More so, I was impressed with Justin Timberlake's acting. He was actually pretty good. Sweet, sympathetic and caring towards Kunis's character. Kunis plays a Headhunter who gets Timberlake's character an Art Director job at GQ. Friends becoming friends with benefits and the positives & the negatives it creates. Entertaining.Quite a few laugh out loud moments. Cute film and I highly recommend it."
5,Friends With Benefits dvd,Most people might not think Justin Timerlake and Mila Kunis could be great together but they are. It's a very funny movie about a real life thing that many people try. I was surprised how funny this was. You will be too.
3,Cute,I am not a big JT fan but figured I would give the movie a go. It was better than No Strings Attached. I would watch it again.
1,Blah blah blah! ANNOYING!!,"Non-stop talking! From the moment they meet and even when they are having sex, they never stop talking! I mean, seriuosly? Can't they shut up even for a few seconds?!?? Jeezz..!! This movie is not funny or even sexy, and the 2 main characters are really annoying! Ugh!Don't waste your time with this movie. I'm sorry I did!"
1,What are people thinking?,"This movie is fair at best. I do believe that just because these two are in it it people think it deserves to be watched. I certainly wouldn't waste my time watching it again and wish I hadn't rented it this time. I don't believe either one of the ""stars"" can act and the so-called plot has been done over and over again."
1,pretty awful,"The movie was mostly awful cliches with moments of humor Enough funny moments to warrant 1 star, but otherwise a truly bad film."
2,Just eh,"Spoiler warning.The leads are charming, but the story lacks depth and is totally predictable. And worst of all, flash mob on movies simply doesn't work, let alone twice. Flash mob is cool in real life, but in movies it's just a cliche, because in movies people burst into songs and dances all the time, been done a thousand times before."
2,Really Dull and the actors have no chemistry,"This movie was just so dull and boring. The only scene I liked was the flash mob scene. Neither one of these actors could pull it off, and they don't have chemistry. Big thumbs down on this one."
2,Formulaic,Young attractive people just out of tedious relationships...check. Complaining how complicated love is...check. Let's hop into bed...check. Quirky relatives/ coworkers on each side that instantly adores new friend...check. Something is said that dooms future together...check. It's magically forgotten after prescribed days of soul searching...check.
2,DVD case came destroyed,"When I received the DVD in the mail, the plastic DVD case was completely destroyed. The whole top half of the case was in 20+ pieces and a crack went down the side casing. The DVD was unharmed but if better packaging and handling measure had been taken, I would also have a case for the movie."
4,Loved it...until the cliche ending,"Why, why, WHY! do practically every romantic comedy are ruined with a dreadfully cheesy ending?This movie hooked me - it was sexy, sassy & funny, with witty bantering. Mila Kunis was really good especially. I loved it - until the final reconciliation scene. Ugh! Double UGH! What a way to ruin a good movie. Only that part garnered the cheese factor - I didn't find it romantic at all. I guess I'll just skip that scene.Otherwise, the movie was wonderful. I think there's another movie with the same plot with Natalie Portman & Ashton Kutcher but I like this one better."
3,It was ok.,"This was kind of your typical ""chick flick"" romantic comedy. It had its funny moments, and for anyone interested, there is some brief nudity of both Mila (which I should have probably added a star for) and Justin. The movie is nothing spectacular, but it's a good movie to watch on the couch with your significant other."
2,Harry met Sally it's not,"Tries too hard to be the next When Harry Met Sally with its quick-fire dialogue, which pales in comparison. Hard to like either of them until much later in the movie when they become more like human beings rather than dialogue robots. Her eyes are too big and catlike - looks unnatural. You should know already that this is not a family movie, but just in case ... It's not.Moderately entertaining."
3,Tooo much sex...,I thought the story line was nice but all the sexual content in it was not appealing to me. If you have small children you may not want them to watch this movie. A movie for career minded people.
4,Not a bad little flick,"Ok, I'll admit it ... my wife digs JT and I'm a fan of Mila Kunis so it was not a tough choice to rent this one. However, it was actually a pretty good movie! And, as usual, great stream quality for Amazon."
4,Entertaining,"It's a cute movie to see with your girlfriends or a date night movie. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but it was better than I expected. Justin and Mila did a good job, and I love Harrelson's part."
4,not bad,"For some reason, I'm still trying to grasp the fact that Justin Timberlake is testing out the acting scene. He's not bad, I just think *NSYNC when I see him, Mila is great in everything she does and definitely helps make the movie. It's mostly funny but of course needs the cheesy RomCom ending, but I still liked it :)"
4,"Yeah, another friends having sex movie, but a good one","The plot is not original and was part of a bunch of movies that came out with the same plot.However, this is original in one aspect, the stars have chemistry and talent. And great writing, the dialog is perfect.I never thought I would watch a Justin Timberlake movie.. seriously, but my daughter made me do it, and I am glad she did."
1,Copied No Strings Attached,"Its pretty much a remake of no strings attached, but boring and dull. Compare the movies, its the same concept. The only diffrence is that no strings attached is intresting and origial, while friends with benefits is a cliche'."
5,A favorite,Its a flash mob! This is one of the cuter movies I have seen lately. I loved it the first time I saw it and waited to get it on dvd. JT and Mila have great chemistry on-screen.
1,absolute waste of time & money,This had to have been one of the most dreadful films I have seen in years.Where does one begin? The situation was highly implausible and not even remotely funny.The writing was absolute garbage. Do not waste your money or time.
1,What happened?,"Gotta be the worst video stream on Amazon. And to think I switched from NetFlix for this? Regarding the movie content, it's what one would expect from Timberlake. Wish he could find some depth of character."
1,Waste of time,"Characters were not realistic, the conversations between them were ridiculous. Many scenes were crude and meant for cheap shock for laugh value. If you like to see Justin's butt over and over then you will not be disappointed. The movie only made me chuckle softly once or twice. Overall waste of my 1 hour and fifty minutes."
3,Meh.,"That's what I said after seeing this movie. I love a good chick flick, but this isn't one. It's just take it or leave it. I didn't find it particularly funny or romantic. I've liked both these actors in other movies, so I don't think it was their fault. Hmm, see what you think, I thought is was corny."
2,Not great,Not a very good movie. Predictable & lame plot. We had to force ourselves to continue watching. Acting was not very good and was not believable.
5,Love it,Really enjoyed the show. I was surpirized that Justin Timberlake could act. I liked it as much as No Strings Attached.
4,Great feel good movie,"I loved it, from the time it started. Wondering what was going to happen next. They both had great energy and were very humorous. Great movie for married or single people."
5,Amazing Movie,Friends With Benefits is an amazing movie. The movie is well written and creative. Hilarious and romantic. Definitely a must see.
3,Not a bad movie but i was hoping for more laughs,"Before watching this movie I was aware that it was a romantic comedy about two people who try to have a no strings attached, purely physical relationship. that being said it's pretty easy to figure out the story line, what's going to happen to the characters in the movie and how the movie will end. Over all this was a good movie, however there was more emphasis on the romantic aspect than there was on laughs. I expected this to be more of a comedy with a romantic undertone but I found it to be the opposite. Still the acting was good and the characters are likeable."
3,Okay but could have been better,"Friends With Benefits is a fairly enjoyable rom-com mostly because the two leads are very likeable actors with great comedic skills. Unfortunately the characters they are playing are rather flat and not particularly charismatic. The laughs are few and far between but fortunately there is enough snappy dialogue to keep you interested. It's all very predictable and not as funny as it could have been, but it's still worth a watch because it is quite a pleasant film. It's just that it should have been much better."
4,Sexy Romantic Comedy,"Friends With Benefits is a sexy and eventually sweet romantic comedy. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are hot together and both of them have a nude scene, even if it is just their butts shown. There are many funny moments, and a few serious ones. Not a great movie, as it could have been cut by about 10 minutes. Still, worth watching if you want a new mainstream romantic comedy."
4,"Surprisingly good, completely engaging","Surprisingly good. The broad arch of the story is routine and predictable but the details are well-defined, well-written, interesting, and delivered with conviction and credibility by a top notch cast. I was completely engaged from start to finish. I even teared up right on cue. Damn them for manipulating my emotions so well.Oh, wait, that's their job.Well done!"
3,"Better Than ""No Strings Attached"", but not by much","This movie was OK. I thought it was going to be better, but generally speaking I usually have higher expectations of movies. This movie was predictable, but I figured it would be going into it, so I really didn't have that big of a problem with that, It was just the same thing on and on and on, OK we get it, you two can have sex anytime with each other, go into a little more of the back story."
4,"Clever dialog, nice story","My boyfriend - age 56 - who likes sports message movies and spy/war stuff actually liked this movie. I love Justin Timberlake's understated performances and Mila Kunis... be still my hetero heart. The message about friendship making for strong relationships because you can be open if you are not worried about breaking a heart or breaking up, is very good for the 'hooking up' generation to hear. The dialog is great. All in all, a wonderful movie that I may actually watch a second time (I generally watch movies only once)."
4,Cute and funny,Worth watching once cute and funny just as I expected. It is almost identical to the Ashton crusher comedy released a few weeks back.
3,Funny!,"A funny, modern romantic comedy. The plot is pretty predictable but Kunis and Timberlake have enough chemistry together to make the movie enjoyable."
2,Gross Sex - that's pretty much the entire movie,"This movie was too vulgar. There was constant sex, and it was not even ""sexy"". It was just stupid and gross. Wouldn't ever watch it again. actress annoys me too."
4,Didn't I just see this movie?,"Oh yea...""No Strings Attached"". Mila vs. Natalie? Natalie hands down. If it hadn't just been done, this would have been a cute romantic comedy. Justin Timberlake plays the character well, but I can just imagine that he is actually like this. Ok."
1,What? Why?,"Slow-moving. Not funny. Watched first 20 minutes. Couldn't take it anymore. Got to the point when Justin took door off his office to tell his new staff that his door is ""always open"". Oh brother."
1,Awful Movie!,I cannot believe Justin Timberlake has not given up acting! This movie is dull and you will get bored immediately!
5,Great blues singer from the 20's....,"Clara Smith had the prettiest voice of all the classic blues shouters of the roarin' 20's. She took most of her songs with a slow tempo, a very dicty singer with a clear voice. This cd has her earlist sessions backed by many great JAZZ musicians of the era... Highly recommended especially to classic jazz and blues fans."
1,Bad choice,"The worst epilator I have ever had. Really. It just doesn't work at all, maybe it would only on really long and thick hair. On mine it just didn't do anything. Unbelievable, but true. I tried it for 15 minutes and maybe got only couple hair out, I just kept scrubing my leg with it, but not for good at all. I'm really dissapointed and have wasted my money for totally nothing!"
2,"Try a little too much ""nude"" and way too little ""lawyer""!","I can imagine what you would expect buying a movie with a name like ""NUDE LAWYERS"". But, quite frankly, it is far from that! In fact, actual courtroom footage is rare and I was not thoroughly convinced that these people were at all lawyers. In any effect, this movie does have some salvagable features. The set design is very accurate and dialouge is imaginative and well written. With a few alterations this movie could have been big. I'm talking box office gold. Sequels and merchandise, an amazing spectacle of American filmaking. Except for the fact that this movie isnt really good. At all."
1,doesn't stick,we cleaned and wet the windows as instructed but it doesn't stick well. We' also didn't find it dark enough.
4,Enjoyable Romantic Comedy,"I've watched this movie quite a few times now and have enjoyed it each time. It's a light-hearted comedy with very likeable actors. I'm not sure why there have been negative reviews unless someone is going into watching this with the idea that it's going to be a deep, complicated movie. Sometimes it's nice just to watch something for the sake of relaxing and laughing.I definately recommend it."
2,They could have done so much more,Left the film with a great deal of disappointment. The story had potentialities but the director only just touched the surface of a very interesting topic and dilemma indeed. And why the lesbian stereotypes in the bar? As if what all homosexuals want is a quick sexual fix!? Also very bad editing of sound!
3,Not so great,"It's a fairy good romantic comedy, features lesbian character. Nice characters, great acting, decent plot, but the end doesn't really solve the matter in my opinion. Good for a night watch, but that's about it, it doesn't have what it take to be a great romantic comedy or a great lesbian movies.Make up your mind when buying the DVD, but it's pretty cheap so I guess that's okay to have one copy for your collection."
2,Very bland,The dialogue in this movie sucks. It is either not funny or extremely cliche. It could have turned out so much better with the general plot of the movie but it was a huge turndown for me.
4,Suspend your disbelief,"and you'll like it just fine. A few scenes at the beginning are completely far-fetched and impossible to believe and i think that is what throws it for most people. The last scene in the elevator is a little too preachy - though too true. I liked it because it reminded me of my own shock and confusion and horror at realizing I was gay - which eventually gave way to love, self-acceptance and happiness. It takes time and everyone reacts differently. I thought Gray's reaction was pretty spot-on. Especially when she looked at the girl passing the hot-dog vendor.So - if you can forgive the beginning a little, you'll probably like it..."
1,One of the Worst Coming-Out Movies Ever!,"There's a lot to choose from, unfortunately, when talk turns to bad lesbian movies. But even, say ""Claire of the Moon,"" which I found ponderous at best, had good intentions and a decent sex scene. This movie has one kiss that one of the people involved doesn't even remember.The idea had potential and the cast is good, but the story reels from one fake and ridiculous setup to the next. Do yourself a favor and see ""Imagine Me & You"" instead."
5,Gray Matters is Great!,"Great is all I can say. I have been so bored with every romantic comedy that has come out in the past five years. Finally a movie with heart, soul and originality. The cast is superb, the writing is fantastic and it's a great postcard of New York City. I laughed and I even shed a tear or two! This should have been the comedy of the year. I highly reccomend it. Molly Shannon is also hilarious--some of her funniest acting yet."
5,Gray Matters movie review,"This movie is hilarious! I can watch it over and over again. If I feel like I need a laugh, I watch it! It has great acting and the writers did a great job with the script, it is unpredictable and witty. I highly recommend this movie. And the actors are top notch!"
3,Adorable movie,"Yes, it was not the best movie in the world in terms of it's storytelling. But for what it's worth Heather Graham sold her part enough to have me I fell in love with her character. I watch it every now and then when I need a pick me up from a bad day."
4,Great fun!,"This is a great, fun movie that is a romantic comedy in the genre of those 1940's gems some of us are old enough to remember.True to life? Not much. But it is just light hearted and fun with some cute dance routines. The actors are all good in their roles and sure it would have been nice to have Gray experience a little more romance for us all to ogle, but it was sweet and unreal and smile worthy.Nothing earth shattering, nothing overly dramatic, just a good fun time.Enjoy it. I did and I do. Bought it and have fun watching it anytime I want something just fun."
2,Muddled and disappointing,"The story of the remarkable woman who came up with the London A-Z map is well worth telling. From a traumatic upbringing, Phyllis Pearsall became a one-woman cartographic dynamo who worked tirelessly well into her 80s.Unfortunately, this book is muddled, amatuerish and disappointing, reading more like a self-published book than one from a respectable mainstream publisher. The structure is all over the place and the copyediting woeful."
5,Excellent Value,"I bought this bag for my husband and he's very pleased with it. It's his first guitar gig bag but he says compared to his Domke and Tamrac photography bags, the quality of construction of the World Tour Bag is not far behind. Given the price, it's an excellent value."
4,Good choice for a padded bag,"This bag is just right for my elementary school aged daughter to keep and carry her short scale bass to lessons in. Smelled very chemically straight out of the package, but once it aired out, the odor is no longer a problem.The box that the item arrived in was a bit beat up, and half of the tape was coming off, maybe even cut, leaving the item to easily fall out. The delivery guy commented that the box says ""rate this package"" in large type on the side of the box. HA! I give the shipping package one star.Overall, this will be a fantastic case/bag for my daughter's bass!"
5,Fits my short scale perfectly,Although this is a full size bass bag it fits my short scale bass almost perfectly. Love the World Tour gig bags.
1,Bare minimum if you have a cheap bass,"This is a poor example of a protective case. I am only going to use it for transporting my bass in the car and then being VERY careful handling it. It gives very little if any real protection for an instrument. If you have an expensive bass, buy a different case, preferably a hardshell case and you won't have to worry like you would if you purchased this one. Trust me, I have LOTS of guitars and would NEVER EVER purchase another case like this one."
4,Liverpool in the USA/CSA Civil War,"Just curious if the author would investigate any role Liverpool Mormons might have had in the war between the US Army, Stephen Douglas, and the Democratic Party, vs the Mormons and Indians of Utah, Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York. I stumbled into this as I investigated the USM Lady Elgin Shipwreckat http://groups.msn.com/LadyElginShipwreck"
1,lamo,"this is the absolute worst album I have ever bought. I have all of UGK and all the solo albums. Been listening to them over 10 yrs now. not only does it lack any musical anything, but you have someone saying, ""gangsta breezy!almost every minute of every track. So annoying. I am very surprised Bun let himself be involved with this mess.I threw it out of the car window..where its rightous place belongs"
2,"Good start, Flat end","Give me a good story, follow it up with consistency, add in a good ending = I'm hooked.This one started, and died. Towards the end, I was in pain due to my inability to stop - like watching till the end of a bad movie.Haven't read ""answer man"", and not sure I will."
3,would have been better if Johansen had visited Atlanta,"I read ""Rebecca Sunnybrook's"" review warning that Johansen didn't know his location, but decided to ignore her advice. For the most part I'm glad I did, the plot was interesting, several twists surprised me and I enjoyed the characters. I'd pick up a sequel with Joe Bailey, but I'm hoping he moves to, say, Chattanooga. ""Rebecca"" was right, almost every location mentioned is misplaced or misrepresented. In the climactic scene, when the villain runs through the woods off Rockbridge road and finds himself (1) on top of Stone Mountain (2) staring at the Appalachians in the near distance, I was laughing so hard I couldn't pay much attention to the final resolution. Perhaps Mr Johansen could invest in a map, if he can't be bothered to pick up a visitor's guide, before his characters' next outing."
4,A good mystery,"Joe Bailey is a police detective in Atlanta who specializes in debunking psychics. Dr. Robert Nelson, a professor at the local university, whose specialty is parapsychology, is found impaled on a wall by a sculpture that no man alone could have lifted. The number one suspect is an eight-year-old boy. In steps Joe Bailey.Roy Johansen has written a good mystery, and in creating a skeptical and rational character, as portrayed by Bailey, a refreshing one at that. Johansen shows how easily charlatans and psychics fool people.A solidly written mystery, which I thoroughly enjoyed.Inside the covers:“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof”"
3,All right,"What can I say except maybe I was having an off day when I read this book. I read all the reviews and was expecting this great thriller. Don't get me wrong, I enoyed reading this but it just wasn't the page turner I was led to expect. Actually, it got kind of boring for a while and I almost quit on it, but I did want to find out how it ended. All in all, it was an okay read, it just wasn't the thriller it was purported to be."
2,Let down,"The color is bright and beautiful but that's about it..I though the balls were going to be bigger and infact, the whole set is cheaply made and unattractive..cheap set, cheap quality."
3,An insight in Latino families,"It takes a true comedian that does not use excessive profanity and explicit sex content. That comedian is Paul Rodriguez; but primary George Lopez.The first two comedians were not funny because they were raunchy; their hole comedy punchline was sex. Their jokes were too sick, raunchy, and disrespectful.George was so funny, listening to him was if I was visiting memory lane from my childhood. Yes George is right, we never develop our pictures, we let little ones learn the hard way, and every house has a Socorro. I am that Socorro.I gave the show three stars; but George receives five stars for his routine.So George, keep that funny sense of humor in tact. You really are a funny intelligant man.--S.L."
1,Horrible,"I wish I had seen this before adding it to my list of movies for Halloween. This is not even a movie..it's a video. It looks exactly like somebody used their home video equipment and edited it on IMAC Final Cut Pro editor and used Garage Band music. Also, it was, without a doubt, the worst example of editing that I've ever seen. It's worse than any one of my classroom kids who are just learning about how to edit. I knew within 5 seconds that this was not at all what I thought I was purchasing. The DVD itself just had a sticky top that someone printed HALLOWEENIGHT. Nobody should ever be able to just create their own video and sell it on Amazon unless it's clear in the product description that this was made by an amateur, which clearly this was. I think I learned my lesson to never buy anything without watching it first. Please, don't waste your money or time with this awful video."
4,Read this before,"I renewed my acquaintance with Bradley, and can recommend this to any student of Shakespeare for its tightly controlled writing and sage judgement."
1,Not What I Wanted,"I thought this was Hamlet but it wasn't. It was free so I guess no skin off my back, just annoying that it's now taking up unwanted space on my kindle."
3,No Alice Cooper As Advertised,"Although this video shows great concert footage of various artists such as Little Richard, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, it fails to show any footage of the advertised Alice Cooper. Just like as advertised on ""Roger Daltrey: A Celebration - With Pete Townshend and Music of the Who (1994),"" no Alice Cooper appears in this video either. Please see reviews for Roger Daltrey: A Celebration - With Pete Townshend and Music of the Who (1994) for further infomation:This may not interest too many people, but since the DVD is listed under ""Alice Cooper"", and since he performed the song ""I'm A Boy"" at THIS concert, I went and bought it. BUT THEY CUT THE TRACK OUT! There's no, repeat NO, Alice Cooper track on this DVD! So buy it for any other reason than I did! Or look for a VHS copy of the whole concert or the 2-CD-set.--Dr. Oliver SpangDO NOT BUY if you are looking to see Alice Cooper because HE AINT IN IT!!!"
5,"This is an increadable story, I could not put it down.",The book has a great story and riviting caracters. My only regret is that it's not an ebook too. That way I could take it with me everywhere.
1,disappointed,"The price of this book does not in any way reflect the substance of this book. The book is thin and has very few recipes, and little text from the Anne books. The CD had little music from the first two Anne movies; the music mostly came from other series from Sullivan Productions.I do not recommend this product."
5,Great Product for Pets,My 12 year old Maltese has Demodex. The Goodwinol ointment has been a great product to keep this condition under control. It does stain her fur doing treatment. But I normally leave it on overnight and bath her the next evening. Great product.
4,Complicated face and setting,"It took awhile to figure out what the various indicators on the watch face meant, the digital pie-chart, for example, was not that intuitive. Setting the hands and the time was also somewhat complicated by the inclusion of the temperature bias and timezone into the the setting cycle. But it's a watch with a nice set of features for the price."
1,report abuse in the purchase of this watch,"Hi, I would like to report an abuse on the purchase of this watch by the seller, since I bought this watch on black Friday for a Christmas gift, and I live in Venezuela where we have only 400 dollars a year for online shopping restriction for a national program, then this seller irresponsibility of not updating the online store amazon, sold this item in your physical store and I cancel the order, then to cancel the purchase did not care that my dollar was blocked and lost my $ 74.95 because the bank not to me can be returned because the bar program national de restriction of dollars does not allow me to receive more than $ 400, now I need the seller to be responsible for this purchase to be canceled for irresponsible not to keep their products Amazon, this is an irresponsible seller did not understand the responsibilities they should have with all customers visiting this shop for this reason require the seller or amazon take responsibility for my $ 74.95."
3,Physically Flawed Copy Received,"While I have no doubt this book lives up to all the excellent reviews already posted, I have to mention that the copy I received was physically flawed: it skips from page 144 to page 177, then returns to page 177 after page 208. Just a word to the wise to check your copy when you receive it so that you can return it if need be before you mark in it or break the binding to read it."
2,I can't write a whole review on a bad book,"This fantasy book has probably the most misleading title a book could have. The first 17/18 of the book were all about a faerie prince trying to stop a glue factory, while trying to get out of the human world and into his own. Even that last 1/18 of story barely comes close to touching on the (impending) war. The story is split three ways, which makes it hard to feel any suspense whatsoever. The cliffhangers feel more like annoying stops in the story. The book is fairly well written, keeping you craving more. I couldn't stop reading (mainly because I was waiting for the war). Although it was recommend from a couple of big newspapers, I felt it was mediocre. The writing seemed dumbed down for kids, along with the plot, albeit, not as much."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A novel aimed at the younger reader, but enjoyable enough. A young faerie noble is moved to the normal human world to keep him safe. He develops a friendship with a boy, and an older man, who happens to be of the scientific bent.So, the two kids of different races get into trouble and danger, etc."
3,NOT FOR YOUNG READERS 5-8 GRADE!,"SEE ALL THE REVIEWS ATTACHED TO THE HARDCOVER EDITION OF THIS BOOK. Not for young readers. The war between the Faerie's is interesting, but when the main characters mother has an affair with another woman and breaks up her marriage with the father, you take the story to a whole new level. Infidelity in marriage isn't appropriate for 5-8 graders especially when it's treated so lightly. I wish I had read the reviews before buying it for my 10 year old."
2,Don't be fooled by the catchiness on the cover,I never did get a chance to finish this book because I just couldn't get past the first 100 pages without being intimidated by the sad lesbian case going on here. I just couldn't get into this book and don't reccomend it to anyone who's used to reading about straight people with children!
2,NO CIGAR,"I gave this novel about 30 pages and found myself not engaged whatsoever. SPOILERS: The whole mother having an affair with the secretary was an interesting change as to why a child's parents break up but that wasn't enough to keep me going. Overall, I found it too slow for my tastes. MY GRADE: C minus."
4,Quite lovely really,"Oh dear... Mr. Brennan has gotten some of you in a snit, hasn't he? Well, all I can add to the clamoring voices is: to each her own. I like that there is swearing (because it's never over the top and good heavens, Confucius said, ""Always use the right word,"" and sometimes ""bloody hell!"" is the right word. Words.I don't recommend this book for kids below high school age; I'm not a fan of violence in kid books, but I will say (as I've said before), closely scrutinize any Disney animated feature and you will find violence, murder, threats of murder and profoundly intense themes (such as separation of a child from his parents, etc.). Having said that: Grab this up, high school crew! You'll love the cheekiness!"
2,Little to no plot...yawn,"I decided to give Faerie Wars a try after reading Wicked Lovely and Ink Exchange. This book didn't wow me in any way. Faerie Wars starts off with a bang. The son of the emperor of light faeries is on the run after stealing a Pheonix, he stumbles upon a secret, gets captured and escapes a few times, just to be scolded and exiled by his father. Then it goes down hill. We meet the human and hear about his problems while a sister searches for her lost brother. There is some sort of war looming in the background, but it stays mostly in the background. I do not think this book is dark in any way. It is DEFINITELY a KIDS book. I can't quite put my finger on why I don't like this book, it is a great setup for a story, but the execution is boring to me. Not much really happens in this book, maybe it will get better, I may give the other books in the series a try."
2,HATED IT!!!!!,"I bought this book thinking, ""hey, its sorta like Artemis Fowl, right? It can't be that bad...."" I WAS HORRIBLY WRONG!!!! When I finished I thought- ""I spent $18 on this c**p!"" I really can't explain why it dissapointing. Maybe my expetations were too high or something like that but this book really dissapointed me. If you're really set on reading this get it from the library first. Don't make the mistake I did by buying a book you'll end up hating. It might of been the air of satanisim around the whole thing that made me hate it but maybe its just me. If you want a good read, read the Artemis Fowl series or something by Ben Jeapes. Just remember TAKE IT OUT OF THE LIBRARY FIRST!!! I don't want anyone to waste almost $20 on this like me. This goes for any book one has read a lot of controversial reviews about. For potential buyers of Faerie Wars, heed my warning."
3,You get what you pay for,"I knew purchasing this item that it's not the best tent available, but with a $100 amazon credit, I figured ""why not? Its not really gonna cost me alot"". We set this tent up the day before our daughters bday party, and besides having to use our own better stakes, it did the trick. Its a flimsy cheapo tent, thats kinda a pain in the neck to put together, but for the price its fine. We disassembeled and packed it away just fine. We didnt use the walls, but just note they are thin (as well as the roof) and will not hold up well in high winds or heavy rain, but to provide shade it did the trick!"
5,These tents are very good for the price.,"We bought 2 of these tents last year and another this year for our annual party. We had 3 people setting them up. First we put together the top 1/2 and put on the canopy, then put the poles on the bottom 1/2 and all went very smoothly. We feel what we got for the price was more than worth it. It costs more to rent a 10 x 20 tent then to buy this tent. So we are thrilled with these purchases, as we will use them many times."
1,Canopy from Hell,"I asked if this was an EZ Up canopy this is how it's listed let me tell you it isn't it took 8 guys to get it up, made of very poor material the frams is plastic not aluminum and most poles don't lock at all once up the wid lift it up just like a huge kite even with cinder blocks holding it down on all sides. terrible don't buy fast shipping great price but you get what you pay for just buy the real EZ Up tent my girl Scout troop endded up selling cookies in the beating sun with no shade dealing with this mess wasted our hard earned cookie money. Bad decision pass on this one :("
2,Let the wind blow!,"The slightest breeze will blow this over, bend the tubes and ruin the day, but its CHEAP!"
5,Awesome!,Had all the parts and worked for our Halloween party (was a little wind and it stood fine). Good Buy!
5,Best investment ever!,I purchased two of these for a graduation party that I was hosting. This product arrived on time and the set up was extremely easy. For less the price of a rental of the same size I get to keep these and use them over and over!
1,Don't waste your money,"Total ripe off...their great canopies for the 1st use but once you try to use them time after time the frames just completely come apart. When calling back the manufacturer they are not willing to exchange nor refund any of your money back it was just a total waste of our money; which, was quite a bit since we brought 6 canopies."
3,canopy,The canopy worked great once we got it together the only problem we had was that a couple of the pieces didnt have the things to lock them in place. Overall it served its purpose.
2,READ the reviews BEFORE you order...,"BIG MISTAKE...the price is cheap (and free shipping too), but still not good. Too flimsy and lightweight. I wanted to return it, but, the cost of return shipping AND 25% RESTOCKING fee makes it CHEAPER TO KEEP HER!Michele/So Jersey."
3,Good for the most part,I put the party tent up this weekend for the first time and it worked great. It was a little more lightweight and flimsy than I had expected though. When I took it down yesterday one of the velcro strips that holds the canvas to the poles ripped off. That kind of ticked me off. I didn't spend $120 on this to have it break the first time I use it. It is very cheaply put together. I have to use it again this weekend for a yard sale so we'll see if it breaks anymore.
5,Great canopy tent,The guys had no trouble setting up this canopy. We used it for an octoberfest BBQ contest. Having the option of putting the sides on in case of bad weather is great.
3,A Little Flimsy,"I was attracted by the great price of this tent, but it's a little flimsy and on a windy day, can be more of a hassle than it's worth. Having the detachable sides is a nice feature - in the case of inclement weather."
3,ok,i did use it for my son first birthday party and that's all. its very nice looking but doesn't last it all
1,Sent back today,Shipping was great. Product is junk. The directions are vague. After a few hours of the tent being up the poles collapsed and bent. The return process is great as this is the first product I've ever returned through amazon. So stay away from this product if you're looking for quality.
2,White party tent gazebo,We received the tent before its expected arrival! Thank you! When putting it together there were only instructions for the metal poles. The cord to stake it down with was not long enough so all of the lips ripped off. The stakes were just little metal smooth bars. We had to purchase our own string and our own stakes.
1,Terrible,Didn't even last a week. We tied out down really good and it still broke the poles in half. The poles are very weak.
1,Stay away from this company!,"My wife and I attempted to erect this canopy with poor results. The poles are made of light gauge metal and the canopy material is inferior. After erecting the frame, we were discovered that the canopy did not even fit over the frame. We paid about $70 just for shipping on this product and would have to pay another $70 to return it, if they would take it back. Stay away from this company."
1,Worst tent - can't return even when poor quality! BUYER BEWARE!!,"Apparently the very last line of the product description is one that should be listed first -- all sales final.When this tent arrived, it was the poorest quality and most flimsy tent I have ever seen. Even when wanting to return it for a better model, I'm stuck with it.BUYER BEWARE ON THIS ITEM!If only I had read the last line of the description and the bad product reviews, I would not be out money on this. I certainly won't order another product through this manufacturer, either!"
4,"Great product, lightweight though","This was a good tent, loved the ""windows"". Needs to be used on a surface that can be tied down or staked to the ground. Tent is lightweight so wind can easily move it & can sway. Easy set up with 2-3 people, about 30-45 mins"
1,Absolutely horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,We purchased 3 tents from this company and they were so cheaply made!! Could of got a better tarp from the dollar store!!! We set the tents up on saturday the MORNING of my WEDDING!! And while we were putting them up i cant tell you how many times they ripped!! And one SMALL wind came and they completely collapsed!!! Ruined my wedding plans the DAY OF! Please do not wast your money on these!!!!!
1,DON'T BUY!,HORRIBLE waste of money. No instructions came with it and zero response from the company when I emailed asking for some. Took SIX hours to figure out and erect then my cats sneezed on it and it crumbled. No way to send it back. Stay away from this product!
5,great product for price,"I have purchased this product about 2 weeks ago for my son's 5th b-day. Everybody loved it...and they were more surprised for how much i payed for it, plus the free shipping cost. Shipping was fast (as usual with amazon shipping)after the next day, me and a friend of mine assembled the tent. We started by counting the number of pieces corresponding to the part number labelled as per illustration, then i placed the parts to where i plan to erect it... have a duck tape at hand to keep poles become more sturdy. I secured joinings with the duck tape to keep it from detaching. I love the side walls, we made an extra shed by using a bamboo poles to errect it as an awning for the walls that has the zipper on it. It sustained the heavy rain and scorching heat. By the time for my boy's party it was well cherished and appreciated.it is all worth the money."
1,Badly Constructed Canopy,Sad to say that we have had many of the same problems others have complained about. It took five of us to put up the canopy. The polls kept coming apart. We finally took duct tape and taped the joints together. When wind blew it almost carried it away. We should have read the other reviews before purchasing this item.
2,Nice but not what I was expecting,"I thought this was going to be a gazebo that could go up quickly and easily. It was not what I thought I was getting. In the heavy winds that we get, it can not be taken down quickly enough to protect it. It was not the company's fault, it was mine for not reading more carefully what I was buying."
1,Very Fragile,"This ten is made of plastic and very thin metal that fall apart very easily. It the cheapest material you can use for product that I've seen. It may last you a day or so, then it's down hill from there. I recommend do not by this product get a pop-up canopy they are much more secure..."
2,Cheap,Bought this item for my niece but the quality is very cheap. Not at all what i expected to purchase. Glad this was only for playing dress-up.
3,A So-so answer to an Egg-cellent Question,"""How does an egg like this grow into a chicken like this?"" Selman's book provides a detailed answer to what is surely a common question, beginning with a look inside the hen's body and even illustrating the stages of development of the chick within the egg.Egg to Chick is supposedly geared towards ages 4-8, but it seems that younger kids would have trouble with some of the vocabulary (sperm, embryo) and concepts (dogs and humans start out as eggs; fish and human embryos look alike), while older kids might be bored with the simple cadence of the writing. Nonetheless this might be a nice resource for families that raise chickens or for exploring comparative anatomy in a relatively simple way."
3,LAST CALL.... FOR FLIGHT 21,"Chicks don't fly at 21 days....they hatch! This is a very good book for the study of the life cycle of chickens. We used this to help our children (and us) to know what in the world was going on in those eggs.We have incubated and let the hens sit on the eggs. My advice: let the mommas do it. CAREFUL ! Roosters are lurking in this book ! You know what that means? Your children will if your not careful !Which came first, the chicken or the egg? I know, do you ? I JUST LOVE THE PICTURES OF THE GROWING CHICK IN THE EGG. SEE YA' AT THE HEN HOUSE."
3,"Good Point, Painful Read","What really endangered the success of Bettie's message was not humanly bias, but her writing style. Bettie tries so hard to convince the reader that her study is important that she becomes verbose; she spends so much time telling us everyone else has it wrong (except for her) that her tone goes from conviction and pleasantly tenacious to grating. The complexity of the issue need not result in literary inaccessibility. Bettie's sentences stretch into several lines and her chapters become bloated when they could easily be summed up by what most people already know: we're missing the rest of the picture if we just focus on gender--it's a more complex issue...otherwise known as: you can't see the forest for the trees."
3,Ok addition to the rudolph movie,"This is an OK book, we were just looking for anything else 'Rudolph or misfit toys' and it's just OK. It's about the misfit toys who want off the island, so they sabotage the Christmas party so King Moonracer will be upset and send them away. Rudolph isn't in the story at all, mostly Dolly, Charlie-in-the-box and King Moonracer. Paperback book also."
4,Movie Review,Very eye opening movie about struggles of supply chain troops movements to reinventory frontline US TROOPS!!Well worth watching
2,Top-heavy with editorial bias,This project was a great idea and the film itself is a pretty good production. But I have to agree with the other poster. It all comes down to the post-production and editing. How did this turn into an anti-Haliburton / anti-Bush/Cheney rant? It did so because of the producer's bias.
3,War is Glossy,For those who just cannot get enough of war and are tired of Hollyweird's sugery version this is the ticket. The whole un-retouched truth with great pictures and plenty of details. It's as close as you can get without mud and battle fatigue.
3,Where is the magazine?,Yes I LOVE Military heritage and have been a subsciber in the past. And as of late have been reduced to going to the bookstore to buy. Complaint is that it has been 5 weeks since my purchase and I'm STILL waiting deligently for it to come to my house. Love Amazon and love the Kindle but some things just need to quickin for response times.That and they need to have more authors( Simon Scarrow and Conn Igguldon) and all there series for the Kindle in regards to the selections.Thank YouChristian Miller

2,Dated and full of typos!,"The book has plenty of good ideas, but many of the tactics described are rather dated considering the current buyers market and the state of current residential real estate. Beyond being dated (for instance the author talks about purchasing a palm pilot, and how to use a little known product called Google) it feels as though you are reading the first draft because there is a typo on almost every single page!Finally, it is a little insulting how shameless the author is in promoting his Web page and previous book. If this books is dated I can only imagine how out of touch a previous book would be!Many of the authors ideas are fine, but the over all content is very weak."
4,Mobility gadget,This product help me to face needs of mobility and independence of moderns tasks... it is great on this...!
4,Candle making made simple,I was recently shopping for help in getting back into the swing of things on all the how to's that i'd forgotten in candle making and this book was it! From all the simple projects to the fun of making candles David covers it in this book. Very fun and easy projects in this book. Thanks Donna
2,Ronin Warriors Message ~ Ronnin Warriors Ova,Disappointing storyline. This was not what I expected from a Ronin Warriors/Samurai Troopers story. There was some nice anime though. I just wish the story had lived up to the original series.
5,This book is for christians only!!!!,"This book was written to christians not people who are curios about the devil and demons. Lester sumrall was a man of god. Tryning to show that us chritians have authority over those dark forces, not to be fearful of them."
5,one of my favorites,good interpretation of a classic yarn...helps that Berni Wrightson did the original story art and that the movie tries to capture some of Wrightson's images.
4,Fine Adaptation of a Tale from Creepy,Jenifer represents a fine adaptation by Dario Argento of a tale from the graphic novel Creepy that makes you think twice before empathizing with disfigured individuals.
3,Jennifer a review,Jennifer from the Masters of Horror arrived on time on excellent condition. For the cheap price it was okay. Whewthe make up on her face was weird looking. I couldnt figure out what she was just a monster I guess. Its worth a onetime watch. No classic just middle of the road. It haa some fairly knarly effects.
1,"such a bad movie, words cant describe... i wouldnt wish my worst enily to watch this","I'm sorry, but I don't think that this should be in the genera of horror because it fundamentally consists of a man having sex with a ""mentally challenged"" girl. The plot makes little sense and there are no unexpected twists in the movie what so ever, with the exception of a man (who seems to be an upstanding citizen) having sex with a mentally disabled girl. The movie was a waste of my time and should be locked away in a vault to be burned at a later date. My Younger sister decided she wanted a little scare and borrowed this movie, now we joke about how ridiculous this disturbing movie was. Anyone who truly likes this movie should think long and hard about what this story would be like in real life (the rape and capture of a young womanwith extreme mental problems).I watched it once and will never forget how this is the worst movie i've ever seen"
1,Horror for imbeciles...,"The fact that a group of supposedly intelligent professionals in the entertainment industry got together to make this ridiculous excuse for a film is unbelievable to me. A cop throws away his whole life with his wife (who's hot) and his son, and his career, for a hideously disfigured, retarded, psychopathic cannibal girl, because she has a good body? Any viewer who did not feel that their intelligence was severely insulted by this nonsense must be as retarded as the girl was. I mean, I wouldn't have brought her home in the first place, but after she ate the family cat, I'm pretty sure I would've kicked her ass to the curb. And not even chowing down on a little girl's innards was enough to turn this moron cop off to her. Truly absurd, ludicrous beyond anything I've ever seen before. And the guy who thinks some people just ""didn't get it"" because they may be a woman or gay? That dude needs to seek some psychiatric help as soon as possible..."
2,"I love Steven Weber, but...","...he can do, and has done, so much better than this. Soft-core porn featuring a mutant woman with a great body and demonic face. Must've needed that paycheck, huh, Steve. He also wrote the teleplay based on the comic. I won't repeat the synopsis since it has already been done several times on this review board, suffice it to say the theme--sexual obsession--is often explored in a myriad of ways*consider Lolita* however this tale had to have been a lot better on paper than film."
1,Masters Of Horror gives the term Butterface a new meaning,"What a piece of trash this installment was. I actually have been wanting to see this for some time, but now wish I never even bothered. The story was beyond weak as was the acting. The only scary factor was how the main idiot could fall for such a beastly looking mess like Jennifer. Even if she had a nice body it still doesn't change the fact that her face looks like it got hit by a mac truck and she has no means of communication. Not to mention she eats people and house cats! If thats not a sign that says steer clear I don't know what is.In typical fashion this was another mess courtesy of MOH. I really hate to bash flicks, especially short films because I usually enjoy them so much, but this was just a joke. Don't waste your time. If you want to watch a really good MOH (which is nearly impossible) then thry ""The Black Cat."""
2,the best thing I can say is that at least it is only 58 minutes long,"Wow. This movie was pretty awful. I was hopeful in the beginning when they showed Jenifer's face and it made me jump and my skin crawl. But even then I had my doubts. The guy she was with in the beginning didn't look like a homeless man to me-he looked like your average professional. Yet, he was repeatedly referred to as ""homeless"" and a ""derelict"". As the movie went on holes in the script annoyingly showed themselves. One minute Spivey is a police officer, the next he's unemployed and setting Jenifer up in an abandoned cabin in the woods. What?? I can say that the ending wasn't bad, all things considered. I also liked the movie's brevity. There were a few laugh-out-loud moments but they did not make up for the many shortcomings of this ""film""."
3,READ MY REVIEW!! (If you haven't seen it yet),"OK lets get this straight, I like Masters of Horror, but they should really work on their endings! This 1 hr. episode is all about one girl cannibal, and they couldn't even make her die?! She turned a cat into pieces, she killed this little asian girl, she made this guy into pieces too, she even ate some guy's private part! And she still survives after Frank tried to kill her (but failed when some hunter had to shoot him)! Tons of sex, but creepy sex. Jenifer is hot without her nasty make-ups and masks! But Frank didn't even try to get his wife and son back after they left him while Jenifer was eating their cat!"
3,Very underwhelming for fans of the original comic,"I am a big fan of the original Creepy comic story. This award winning tale illustrated by the great Bernie Wrightson has literally haunted me for years (as it did Steven Weber it seems). I had always hoped that it would one day be made into a feature film. Well, this DVD is not quite feature length, but I'm glad someone finally took on the project anyway. For fans of the comic, you may be a little disappointed. This movie just doesn't get under your skin like the original story, but it's still not bad as the same plot is still there. For those who never read the comic, this is still not a bad watch. Very gory, very sexy, and comical at times. I thought it was very entertaining overall, but it sure won't haunt me for years like the original comic had (and still do)."
3,sex & murder has an ugly face..,"Dario Argento directs a strange little tale here involving a young girl with abnormal problems. Steven Weber stumbles upon what appears to be a domestic scuffle. When everything is said and done the girl has no where to go and Weber allows the girl to stay with him and his family temporarily. He soon finds that he has made a huge mistake. This girl is not only just a little abnormal, she is down right deranged. Her depravity leads to more than a few gory cannibalized deaths and after several sexual encounters with the macabre woman Weber seems intranced by her. In the end Weber discovers why the girl may have gotten in the mess he originally found her in. One thing is certain once the movie was over I discovered that blondes with hot bodies really do have more fun reguardless of hideous facial deformations."
4,Fan of Horror,"I'm not educated on the background of this film, the origin, etc. but I am a fan of horror movies. I like this moving alot for the simple reason that it grossed me out. The gross out is an important aspect of horror, not the SINGLE most important aspect of course, but one of them. This film, portions of it were disgusting to watch, which in turn (being a gore fan)made me want to watch it more. The disfigured character Jenifer pursues Frank Spivey (Steven Weber) after she is rescued by him. From there it quickly builds into a bizarre ride filled with lust, cannibalism & animal mutilation. A must for Argento fans, a must for fans of the genre."
3,WEBER GETS CAUGHT,"Dario Argento brings creepy feel to this strange story of a man who finds himself enthralled by a repuslively ugly yet sexually attractive and mysterious woman. Steven Weber gives a good performance as Frank, a cop who saves Jenifer from a man about to kill her with an ax. He takes her in and finds himself strangely attracted to her. Jenifer has some strange eating habits, though, and Weber finds his life ruined by his involvement with this strange cannibalistic nymph.The ending is ironic, and its inevitability satisfying. Quite different horror."
2,"Succeeds at being disturbing, but that's all","Police detective Frank Spivey (Steven Weber) rescues Jenifer (Carrie Ann Fleming), a disfigured young woman, from her would-be murderer, then takes her in despite the toll on his family life and her penchant for freshly killed meat. It is undeniably disturbing, but to what purpose? Despite her spectacular body, I was unable to understand why Spivey and so many other men apparently feel so protective of her since her habits and her face are so thoroughly repulsive. Perhaps it was the point that the nature of the human male is such that he is willing to overlook a great deal in order to have ready sexual access to a magnificent female form. However, the atmosphere of this film is so unrelentingly grim that it is difficult to credit director Dario Argento with any satiric intent. The result is a string of gross-out moments with little discernable purpose."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"The concept is a chick with an effed up face. Everything beyond that is standard issue. Make the character a regular violent homewrecking troubled teen and it's just Poison Ivy again and who cares. It's all about the deformity, and I think that's ok, it's enough to make anything memorable. I'd love to see the show Ugly Betty made with a lead character who looks like this. This episode does have the standard Tales From The Crypt/The Outer Limits twist ending which I kinda saw coming, but it has more style than that for the most part. I would have much preferred it to have an ending that was more true to the characters and less a twist directed at the viewer though."
4,Argento back in true form!,"As a fan of Dario since I was a child, I was a bit let down by the recent Sleepless, Card Player and I Like Hitchcock. The biggest problems that held him back were, in my opinion, bad scripts and horrible dubbing. His visual excesses let him get away with it for a while, but eventually even his trademark flourishes couldn't save him. Shoot in English or in Italian I always said..... the multi-cultural casts and cheesy dubbing became unbearable.With his latest work, Jenifer and Pelts, it is a relief to see him backed by solid scripts, good acting and decent production values. In fact, cable TV has let him go further than theatrical ever did.See this film, be horrified, excited, repulsed. It's true Argento."
1,Worst Movie EVER!!,"This the the worst movie I have ever seen. I will never get that time back. The plot was stupid, the acting was terrible and it was just a waste of time. There are so many great books out that that could be made into movies and yet they crank out this crap! It is not even worth the one star I was forced to give it!"
1,Sad and Sorry,"This movie has the people that could have made it a real funny movie but as to my discovery it sucked. Don't buy it, it will only disappoint you."
5,These episodes are Simpsons classics that you must have.,"Volume 10 includes B+ episodes, vol 11 include 2 of the two best episodes ever! Vol 12 also includes great episodes."
4,definitely need a kitchen scale,The book provides a fairly broad range of basic and some more complicated sauces. It is a bit short on helping you decide which sauce you should use for different dinners. It appears to have been written somewhere that they use the metric system for the amount of different ingredients. You definitely need a kitchen scale to measure many of the ingredients.
2,Complex device but No Manual,"It simply amazes me that Garmin has the audacity to issue a device like the eTrex Vista HCx without documentation or proper manual. The device is complex and apparently can do many things (some unnecessary for any experienced hiker, btw) but there is no way to understand and operate this model. The etrex operating system is different than other Garmins I've owned and there is absolutely minimal documentation and Garmin technical support is unfortunately particularly unhelpful. The 3rd party training video is helpful but cannot compensate for lack of a decent manual.So... you get to spend $299 retail for something that might be better used as a fishing line weight - OR - you're going to spend an awful lot of time in frustrating trial and error operations attempts. Use another product, do not purchase this waste of valuable hiking time.Garmin eTrex Vista HCx Waterproof Hiking GPSGarmin eTrex Vista HCx Color High-Sensitivity Mapping Handheld GPS"
3,more infomation................,"for those whom are still looking/hunting around for the DVD version of I spit on your grave, there are still ample stocks left at [...] You can also search around at[...]happy shopping.............written by:Ang Poon KahDirector Ron Howard for film Da Vinci Code.Medical findings for medicine Protase."
2,"bad, bad, bad","i liked the movie, ""I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE"". so, i thought this collection would be interesting or, at least, similar..definetly not the case. 4 out of five movies were more like a horrible porn. (imagine, a movie worse than the worst porn you've ever seen. even the sex scenes were awful.) these would be the ones NOT to see. forget about the acting and plot..oh well, live and learn..."
2,slow and slower,"I think that breathing is important, but this is hardly more than breathing. Not what I expected. I have other videos by other people that are MUCH better and MUCH more challenging, and not as boring..."
4,more complex than meets the eye,"I'm going to give this workout another chance. The movements seem simple, but are more complex than they seem. Although it is relaxing I haven't yet felt anything in my abdominals. I'm going to practice this routine some more before I give up on it. Also, I've found that you can use an old pair of pantyhose in place of the stretchie band in the dvd."
1,Too boring,"I found this video to be too slow and too boring. I did the ab section first and I almost fell asleep waiting for her to stop talking and start working. I understand that Yoga is to be peaceful and slow, but this was way beyond slow. It was a drag! I wouldn't recommend this video to my worst enemy. Buy this video if you need something to help you fall asleep on your yoga mat!"
1,Horrible,"I knew the reviews were mixed, but I wanted to give it a try. I kept waiting for the actual workout to begin, she just kept babbling with instructions and you barely do anything. I wish I could return it, it was a total waste of money."
2,Sorry to say,I bought this book 2 years ago and I have not read the whole thing yet. The story is bland and uninteresting at best. It is a not buy.
1,not sure its real,I just got this one and not sure if thats a real perfume. You spay it on and it just doesn't smell or last at all. It was shipped from some Tuccini Corp. in NY.
1,I absolutely hate it!,It's repulsive to my senses! I don't recommend buying this unless you are absolutely sure you want this cologne. Dolce & Gabbana Signature and L'eau D'issey By Issey Miyake are my current favorite!
1,the scent has gone a long time ago,it's probably been shelved for a long while because once you spray it on: the scent evaporates right away. I do not recommend it.
5,scentsational,"Understated, mystifying, sensual sexy. I'd advise anyone to try this....you'll have a new standard to meet. ;-)The ""usual mens fragrances "" will never work for you again."
1,This is a fake product - not the REAL one for $35,"I have been wearing this cologne for over 5 years. When I ran out a few weeks ago, I ordered this one for $35 sold by: amazon, llc.When I got the bottle, I immdiately noticed 3 things:1. when you press the spray nozzle, it sprays too much! My old (genuine) bottle, had small bursts, spraying less volume.2. The smell of the cologne smells too alcoholic3. The scent wears off within minutes ! That's right...I spary it 10 times, after 2 mins, I can barely smell it on myself !With my old bottle, the scent would last the whole day, atleast ! And certainly could smell it on my clothes days later.I will be returning this product and am really weary about $35 dollar colognes that retail for $55+"
4,Nice and spicy,This is a good product. The fragrance is not overpowering and a bit spicy. The sprayer works well and the lid is easy to remove.
5,My wife loves it,A soft yet masculine scent.It is perfect for the 'grown' man that's tired of smelling like he's still in college.
3,Too light,"If you like CK MAN, Versace dreamer , Bvlgari aqua etc, you will probably ""not"" like this, too light for my taste ,I guess if you are into light colognes you would like it, else skip it.Scent stays on for long time though, only complain is its too light , one has to be really close to smell it."
3,An In-Between Study Book.,"My friend and I used this book with a class on NT Essentials (community college). I could follow most of it, with only a little trouble on the OSI model. However my friend having no knowledge of networks period, was lost through most of the book. I would say that you need a general knowledge of networking before using this book. And you definately need to supplement this book with another book before taking exam. For my friend he needs a Beginners Networking Book, this book, another comprehensive book on NT Essentials and a study guide or exam cram book just to have a chance on passing this exam. Definately dont depend on this book alone."
3,"So close, but not good enough","It got me as close as you can get without passing. I crammed for the test, so I probably didn't retain everything I read. It did not, in any way prepare me for the scenario questions on the exam. It also didn't prepare for many troubleshooting questions. I would recommend the book to learn networking concepts, but not for preparing for the exam"
3,A good beginning.,"This book clearly explains the basic networking concepts covered on the exam. It does not prepare students for the ""scenario-like"" questions they will encounter on the real exam, however. Applying the raw information to a real world situation is difficult, and this book does not provide inexperienced students with the tools to answer such questions. The book is a good starting point for an inexperienced beginner, but should be used in conjunction with a quality exam prep engine, such as the Transcender exams, to fully prepare for the test."
1,Not recommended for MCSE exam,"This book will not help you pass the exam. You may learn good networking stuff, but I'm sure when you buy this book, you are preparing for the exam. MCSE exam covers a lot more than what the book offers."
4,Cute.,"I got this because my sister and I quote it and laugh at this special every time we see it. It's nothing amazing by the way of Christmas specials, but it has it's cute moments and is worth watching at least once."
2,Seasonal classic or another Christmas rip-off? You decide,"The Christmas episode is pretty good. It's just that compared to the other PPG dvds, this seems to be a seasonal rip-off. Even the ""Meet the Beat-Alls"" dvd had other episodes on it.Like I said, the Christmas story is good, it has a good storyline and is well thought out. This could well be the best Princess adventure of the Powerpuff Girls. There is a good visual joke where the makers of the cartoon are on Santa's permanantly bad list. Even Mojo Jojo has a brief cameo.The one thing you have to ask yourselves before you buy is ""is one 45 minute episode worth paying for"". There is a Dexter's Lab Christmas story in the bonus section, but I bought this dvd for the PPG not Dexter. There are also 2 songs here, the ""We Three Girls"" song is good, but again I'd prefer more adventures.To sum it up, if you are willing to pay for one (admittedly good) adventure, great, buy the dvd. If not, save your money and tape it when it's shown on Cartoon Network."
3,The three Bs duke it out with the mean P.,"It makes sense that Princess would be the nemesis to our bobble-headed girl's delight of Christmas as she manages to nix her name off Santa's naughty list and get the girls, and practically everyone else, put on it. Oh, that evil schemer! With moments that borrow from ""Mission Impossible"" just as much as from the beloved Christmas poem upon which this title twists its name there is some crackling delight here for both the young 'uns and their elders. But it's all very sleight and over with quickly. Hardly a holiday classic. 3.5 stars."
2,Smelly & Rubbery,"I gave the product two stars because, yes, it will prevent the nano from scratches and dust. But I bought it because of the design and the picture barely represents what the cover actually looks like. Colors are faded and the iJacket literally smells bad. It fits nicely but looks cheap. This product is not worth $9.50."
3,medical terms,"This is good if you know the medical word, but if your looking for a description and you want medical terms that go with it, forget it. Example: if I want the medical term for ""stop breathing"" it won't give me the medical word for it."
4,Substantial Yummy Breakfast- a little dry,"I am a new mom who needs breakfast every day without fail- these are great to grab and go. I love that this is Vegan (unlike the other Erin Baker Breakfast Cookies) and the chocolate chunks are (few but) yummy. The cookie really sticks with you throughout the day. However, it is a little dry. I highly recommend the Oatmeal Raisin. I could eat those all day."
2,Not Vegan! As other reviewers have said.....,"I think these taste good but am not sure why everyone is calling them vegan. The ingredients list dry egg whites. To me this is not a vegan option and I'm disappointed that I ordered based on everyone's review that they were vegan. They taste good to me, but I will not reorder and am disappointed the reviews led me in the wrong direction.So, I give a low review because I hope it will cause others to read the review and know this item is not vegan, as suggested and as searched. Otherwise, if you are not vegan they taste good and I would have been happy."
2,"should be renamed ""Fruity, Not-so-many Chocolate Chunk"" cookies","I'm a veg who makes vegan baked goods and generally uses applesauce or banana as an egg substitute, so I'm no stranger to fruit in baking. However, these cookies have an overwhelming fruity aroma, smell and taste, that I found hard to like and even swallow. I'm guessing it might be the prune puree in the ingredients. Oh and there were a disappointing number of chocolate chips in them - one cookie had two small chocolate chunks. With no chocolate to compensate for the fruity aroma - 2 stars.However, I find these filling and better with a big cup of coffee. So if you like fruitiness and want something filling for a breakfast on the go, this can be a good vegan breakfast item."
2,Cereal in a cookie,"High sugar, low protein, just like many breakfast cereals out there. If you are looking for a direct replacement for a bowl of cereal, this could do it for you. If looking for a breakfast that is healthier then a bowl of cereal then go for something else."
3,19 grass of sugar!,"Here I was looking for a vegan cookie. Found one. But had no idea it had 19 g of sugar per cookie. Would never have bought them.If you are ok with a ton of sugar, they taste great."
1,NOTE THIS IS A REFURB. IT'S NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE REBATE.,"The folks at [Amazon.com] have neglected to point this out, but the unit they're selling is a refurb. As such, it's not eligible for the rebate Asante is offering right now, which makes this limited-warranty refurb a bad deal compated with the brand new 1004 model that replaced it (after the rebate.)"
4,Excellent if you have the requisite mathematical maturity,"I sometimes joke that ""mathematical maturity"" is the ability to understand poor exposition. Lang's proofs are often too terse, and even experienced readers will sometimes have to work hard to fill in all the gaps. For this reason this book is not the best choice for most beginning graduate students. Nevertheless, time and time again in my study of algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry, when there has been some nugget of algebra that I had forgotten or never learned, I have found it in Lang and not in other standard texts. So for me, this book is an indispensable reference. Lang also has a knack for giving insightful summaries of advanced topics. Most other authors will at most mention an advanced topic without really telling you anything about it, but Lang actually gives useful introductions to a large number of topics of current research interest."
3,"A great reference, and a poor first year text","After having struggled with this book for most of my first year algebra class I grew to hate it! I now find myself refering to this book time and time again. This book really has it all. If you already have a good background in algebra and want a great referance, this book is a must. If you are taking algebra for the first time I would avoid this book and look at another intro. to algebra text like Grove (one of my favorite math texts)."
4,Good one volume expostion of basic algebra,"Difficult to agree with my learned friend from Jackson,Mississippi that the chapters on groups and rings were boring. I must congratulate him on finishing the book in one week. More seriously, the book provides enough coverage of commutative algebra,Galois theory and homological algebra as to enable one to tackle the books by Eisenbud and Hartshorne on commutative algebra and algebraic geometry respectively.There are rival treatments by Cohn and Jacobsen but Lang beats them for conciseness.Lang is notorious for errors and omissions in his books and so one would expect a reader to have considerable 'maturity', i.e. the ability to correct proofs or fill in missing details."
4,"A great reference book, not good to learn from","As most of the books written by Prof. Lang, this book is a great compilation, it has what it needs to have, nothing more, nothing less. If you are in Math or any related field, and need a book to refresh your knowledge on Abstract Algebra, this is your book. though, I took a course in Grad School from this book, and I don't recomend it. Fortunatelly I still had the books from my undegrad courses (Rotman's Group Theory book is great), and I did remember the old courses anyway, but I really discourage the usage of this book as a lecture book."
3,"If you don't know algebra, this is not for you.","As always with Lang, this book is not user-friendly. I admit that the third version has much improved from the previous ones. But I am still convinced that it makes a pretty hard reading unless you already have a fair knowledge of algebra as covered by other good textbooks like the three volume by Cohn.If you are new to the subject, I recommend Ash's book recently published by Dover. If you prefer something of a post-introductory level, Dummit and Foote is a good choice. Cohn's three-volume set and Jacobson's two-volume set probaly come to the third stage. Rowen's two-volume AMS monograph covers the subjects that came into play after the publishing of Cohn and Jacobson. If you are looking for a ""definitive"" reference, you should turn to Hazewinkel (but this is not very accessible.)"
2,"Poor Text, Poor Reference","The only thing that comes through cleary in this book is the author's arrogance. The reader will get a very good sense that Lang understands the material, but the reader will also get the sense that there must be a better book out there. Even as a reference, this book is lacking. The index is incomplete, and many important concepts are either poorly defined or the relevant equivalent definitions are not given. Finally, the order in which the material is presented is haphazard at best. This is truly a text only for those with a Ph.D. who work primarily in the field of Algebra."
2,It's compact but where's the plus?,"I'm disappointed with this vacuum and will be returning it. I bought it to do bare floors, under furniture, and places that I can't reach with an upright. It doesn't pick up the layer of dust that covers my hardwood floors. It doesn't seem powerful enough to remove dust from my oriental carpets. The upholstery/crevice tool has no brush and must be held at a certain angle to produce the suction which can be aggravating. The floor tool also has to be at a certain angle to provide the proper suction which can be difficult when trying to clean under the sofa and other furniture. I can't find a dusting brush to fit the wand and I really wanted a small lightweight compact to dust things with. Oh well, you'd probably have to hold that at the exact right angle also. It is lightweight and quiet but who cares if you can't really clean with it. Also, I haven't measured the cord but it sure doesn't seem like it's coming out 17 ft, maybe it's stuck."
4,Shirley's farewell to Fox and her childhood,"This film is a priceless good-bye to and from Shirley at the Fox Studios. The film uses clips from her very earliest efforts to portray her toddler self all the way up to the current story of an orphan (what else!) who is adopted by vaudevillians Jack Oakey and Charlotte Greenwood after her parents die of something when she is a baby. All three yearn to set up a ""normal"" life on the farm her birth parents left to them. Of course Shirley must win over the crusty, mean-spirited local townsfolk in order for her family to claim their rightful place in the small town life they crave. Oakey and Greenwood are smashing as Shirley's parents; their talents literally ooze from their performances, and Shirley is poignant in her good-bye to her status as the most outstanding child film performer of all time. The fact that Shirley could hold her own with the two scene-stealing old showmen is a triumph! Don't miss this underrated Shirley Temple film."
3,Poor film copy - Stowaway,"Okay- not like Stowaway is a long lost and recently discovered film. There are many copies of this film in existence; but the DVD I received is not a very good quality. It has flickering scratches that seem to be on the film itself - consistent pops of little vertical thread lines that you'd expect to see in a silent film that had long been neglected. I'm not a huge fan of colorization, so no color - fine with me. Black and white film has a beauty all its own, but I'd at least expect these big budget films to have had as good a treatment as Cabin Fever gave The Little Rascals on their VHS releases in the 1990's. I'm finding it VERY hard to believe that Stowaway at least has been ""digitally remastered"".I only paid $12.95 for the three disc set at Sam's - I'd be royally ticked off if I paid retail for this copy. I have not seen the other two discs in the set, but either my disc is flawed or the nitrate itself was a poor copy of a widely circulated and available film."
4,"Happy, but a little bit disappointed","I love Shirley Temple. I was sooo excited when this came out. I went right out the day it was released and bought it. I unwrapped them and looked at the back of each movie. I was actually very disappointed that there weren't any color versions. Now, I know that they weren't originally made in color, but the color versions looked great. Fox was doing great releasing the color and black and white versions in the earlier dvds. I actually have the vhs color version of Stowaway. I was going to give it away once I got the dvd. But now I don't have a color version so I am going to have to keep it. :(Keep the color versions FOX!!!!"
2,Color vs black and white,I have a beautiful videotape of Stowaway and Wee Willie Winkie but this DVD is black and white. How disappointing. What happened to the colorizing?
5,fortunate,"This book is a treasure by Swami Muktananda on the meaning behind the translation of the Kundalini Stavah. You would be very fortunate, indeed, to have this commentary."
2,Too Obscure,"I am a comparative beginner at graphics. I had previously purchased Elizabeth Castro's book in this series, on HTML4. This was very good introduction for a beginner in HTML, and I expected the same would be true of the Photoshop edition. Unfortunately, it is not an appropriate book for me, as the approach and examples were not clear enough for self study. It is not clear if this is due to the complexity of Photoshop, or the approach adopted by the authors. I am now looking (warily) for an alternative."
2,If only it was a guide,"While this book does go through the fundamentals of photoshop, it does little to actually guide you through. It makes the same mistake that so many tutorial books do; it tells you what to do but then does not explain why, when or how it works at all. There is very little organized explaination of the different tools and all explainations it does give are cut short. I feel like i need to buy a new book to REALLY learn photoshop."
5,Not a good book for beginners? Nonsense!,"I am a graphics professional in the online industry, and I constantly recommend Quickstart Guides to anyone just starting out. The books are very concise and informative, but most of all they're very affordable. To say that they're not helpful is to display an unwillingness to experiment. Example: A manual can teach you the controls of a racecar, but how you drive it is up to you. Sure you can go out and spend $60 on the Photoshop ""Amazing Tricks, Bells and Whistles"" Bible Volume 1 of 4, making lightening effects and balh blah, but learning the basic and essentials is what matters. VQGs deliver and can empower one to know the application!"
2,Barely adequate,"If you don't have the Photoshop manual (hmmm, why would that be???), you'll find this book quite useful. However, if you have the manual, you're better off passing on this and picking up something with more depth, like Realworld Photoshop."
2,Not good for beginners,I agree with Timothy's review. This book offers few explanations and is of little use to a new user looking for some in-depth guidance. I am also looking for a new book that will clearly teach me how to use and get the most out of this software.
2,Filter is all wrong,"I guzzle ice tea like a Hummer eats gasoline. I tried this ice tea maker hoping it would make my effort a little less. No dice.The problem is the stupid plastic filter. My loose tea leaves get stuck in about a quarter of the filter holes, and WON'T rinse out. So how do I clean it? I have to take a toothpick and INDIVIDUALLY poke out the tea leaves from the filter holes. Annoyingly time consuming and a royal pain in the a__.The pitcher itself is slim so it does fit in the fridge nicely. I went back to the old way of making ice tea because this thing does not really save any time."
2,Good product but wish it was made with a different plastic,"This iced tea maker would have been perfect, but when it arrived I looked at what plastic it was made of and saw it was a #7 which I'm trying to avoid because of concerns about BPA. Bodum does say on their website that most of their products do not contain BPA - http://www.bodumusa.com/shop/pdf/BodumPC-BPAStatement(May2008).pdf, including the items they make that are labeled with a 7. So I suspect this product is fine, but the whole issue is pretty complicated so I chose to return it. I would be thrilled if Bodum would make this product with a different plastic because despite their statement, #7 plastics are getting a bad rap these days, so it would be a good move to just stay away from it. Even better, make it in glass!"
2,Not for loose leaf teas,"While the infuser makes it easy to remove teabags from the pitcher after brewing, it is NOT suitable for loose leaf teas! The holes are too large and allow leaves to pass through and into the main chamber of the pitcher. Other users mention ""a few floaters"" and simply needing to be careful with the last sip, but I ended up with a TON of them. They are even more problematic if you do not finish the tea within the hour; the remaining leaf bits continue to impart tannins and a more bitter flavor. If you want to brew loose leaf teas, I suggest using a french press and then pouring THAT into another pitcher and adding any desired sweetener and ice."
4,quick and easy,"We love this Iced Tea Maker. We used to go through three or four bottles of Honest Tea a day, and now we make our own. The only issue I have with it is that the lid is permanently attached, making it difficult to put in the dishwasher. I hand wash it."
2,too many floaters,"This is a pretty little pitcher, just the size I thought it would be, good for 2 people. I got it to make thai tea, which is loose and a bit of a mess to make a pitcher of it otherwise. So I was looking forward to having the removable filter to make this process easier, but there was way too much loose tea floating in the pitcher that got through the filter. It may not bother some, but it looked dirty and cloudy, not nice for thai tea (or any tea in my opinion - I made the sample loose tea it came with, turned out cloudy and unappealing looking). Now after I brew it, I pour it through a coffee filter inside of a mesh strainer into glasses before drinking, and then it's fine, but I didn't think I'd need that extra equipment. It is pretty to see the process of tea infusing in the clear pitcher, and I can definitely use it with tea bags or for fruit infused water."
1,Smaller than I thought!,"This is tiny. Maybe it will make ice tea for two- but not for a family. Also, I had read on the site that was dishwasher safe. Not true. The lid never comes off so you can not put it in the dishwasher. Maybe there is a larger one? Also for what it is worth, it did not come with the bonus tea sample."
4,Good and Filling,I was not sure about these are the Chocolate Vegan cookies the reviews were all over the place. I ordered being concerned. These cookies are good. Agree they don't have a lot of peanut flavor. I froze mine when they arrived. I microwave them 35 seconds in the mornings. They are wam and good. I usually have oatmeal or a clif bar. These are more filling than the clif bar. Will buy them again.
2,Great breakfast cookie - but not this flavor,"We buy Erin Baker's breakfast cookies frequently to keep on hand in the freezer as they keep extremely well. We really like the large size, texture and most flavors. We won't buy this flavor again, though. It wasn't very peanut buttery, and just not as enjoyable. The Morning Glory and Fruit & Nut are my favorites."
3,"These are ok, other flavors better IMHO","So I have had several flavors of these breakfast cookies and have to say this is one of my least favorite flavors. I think the flavors that are built on oatmeal are better because they taste like they should, like the oatmeal chocolate chunk with raisins are better than these because they taste like an awesome oatmeal cookie with add-ins and not like a oatmeal cookie trying to taste like a peanut butter cookie. The chocolate chocolate chunk ones are three stars too for the same reason. The oatmeal flavors are all 5 stars!"
5,Tasty Cookie!,These are big tasty cookies!..microwave them for no more than twenty seconds and you will have a cookie experience worth having!!..Great value and very addicting!
4,Addicting Breakfast Treat; Price a bit too high for those with a tight budget,"The cookies arrived on time, and they were safely packaged in a refrigerator bag. The cookies taste amazing, the texture was smooth, and chewy, I could taste the peanut butter, and the chocolate chunks were a perfect addition to the cookie. Afterwards, I was pretty satisfied. I highly recommend it as a snack, breakfast food, even a dessert. Although, I only bought it once the price was little bit too high for my budget, of course if with more room in my budget I would buy it again."
2,Weak on flavor,"We love thier Granola and thought thier cookies would be as good - not so much. Other than the chocolate chunks, there is not much flavor."
1,Read the description carefully,If you think this book has any information on cigars be sure to re-read the description very carefully. All it contains is images of familiar objects/settings with cigars incorporated into the image. Of minimal interest to cigar enthusiasts.
5,all-around-best notebook,"I have been an afficionado of blank books since childhood, and this one is the best. A moleskine usually lasts me about a year -- that's a year of grocery lists, ideas, business plans, sketches of where the furniture ought to be, phone numbers, recipes, all the things I might have written on scraps of paper and lost if it weren't for my moleskine. Who needs a Blackberry?This notebook is sturdy, with pages sewn (rather than glued), so they don't fall out. The paper is good quality, a pleasure to write on. There's a ribbon to keep your place, and an elastic to keep the notebook shut while it's bashing around your bag or pocket. There's even a clever little accordion-pleated pocket in the back for receipts or ticket stubs or other small paper treasures.Moleskines come lined and blank as well as squared, but the squared is best for my purposes -- and you'll be amazed how many uses you find for graph paper once you have it."
1,Maybe they used to be better than they are now,"I am very not impressed with this product. The pages and stitches are flimsy, so the pages start coming out long before the book is full. I don't know why these are so highly touted, maybe they used to be better than they are now."
5,Definetely close to real life.,"I totally enjoyed reading Ruy Blas because it dramatically presents a situation that anyone could live. The character Ruy Blas himself and the relationship he has with the Queen, is one of the most realistic ones I have seen in a play. Not only because he is French, Hugo deserves a 5-star rating on this book!"
2,Balance,"The placement of the belt on the case causes the case with the CD player to hang awkwardly at the waist. Buttons are difficult to get to to fast forward, turn on/off, etc."
3,HOLDER,THIS IS SMALL FOR A CD PLAYER I CANT CARRY IT WITH ME BECAUSE I CANT OPERATE CD WITH IT INSIDE THE CASE
2,Walkman CD Carrying Case,"it did not fit my Sony Walkman CD player, too small. Probably my fault, I thought all cases would be comparable."
1,designed by an idiot,1. Sony CD Player does not fit into it!2. Belt will only fir your waist if you wear a size 38 or less.3. Front opening does not access any of the controls just empty space.4. How do I return this item? You can't!
2,Makes a good pet rat carrier,"This CD Case did not fit the CD player ordered, nor did it fit the other 2 Sony Walkman CD players I own.It would not fit the Panasonic or Philips CD players I own.It's a good product, but not for the intended purpose.I thought about using it for a fanny pack, but things would fall out of the opening.Maybe it could be used to carry a pet rat.I gave it to the Mission for women, in Spokane, hoping they could use it."
1,No mobile music-,I bought this specifically so that i could listen to my cd's while doing my daily activities. Great idea but could not fit my player into the holder let alone carrying it around with me. Was waiting to see if my new cd player fit in but just read the reviews and it looks doubtful. Glad I only spent $8.00 total with shipping. Do not buy this holder. Save your money.
2,Did not fit CD player,"The case was mentioned as purchased by others along with the portable CD player I was buying, so I purchased the case expecting it to fit the player.When I received it I found that It was was way too small for the CD player. Not worth sending back due to postage costs, so it sits in junk box for whatever future hold for it. Be sure to read it well and be certain the case is made for the CD Player that you have and do not accepted the suggested selling. I must say, however, it is well-made."
2,........,"The case is too small it does not hold any cd player I have, not even the one I just bought."
2,not as we thought.,"I bought this, thinking my daughter could use it. Turned out she could not use it for her cd player. We kept it for something else, One can only use it with a certain cd player. She will have to carry other things in it."
2,"Doesn,t fit","I ordered this carry case, shown as a companion to a new Sony portable CD player I was purchasing. The case was much too small for the player. It would not go into the case. It was very inexpensive and the seller refunded the purchase price and said I need not return the item."
1,"Not the correct size for my player, so never able to use it.","The case was supposed to be suitable for my ""disc man"" but it was too small and not able to zip so it was not functional."
1,Totally unsatisfactory,This case is too small and had to be returned. This case should not be advertised as fitting this model of the Sony portable CD player.
1,a very poor product,This carrying case ( CDCASE4)is a fraud. The walkman I purchased does not even come close to fitting inside much less allow for access to the buttons. It should not be offered alongside a Sony walkman product. Do not buy it!!
3,Looks good in the description,"Nothing wrong with the case. It performs as expected once the player is put into it and made to stretch out a bit; probably a good thing upon introspection. It does make it difficult to get to the controls though it seems to protect the player well. Of course, you get back to the need for a good supply of batteries since they have a 6-8 hr. lifespan and the AC adapter is not an option."
2,carrying case,"This carrying case was recommended for the Walkman unit I also ordered at the same time[[ASIN:B000MVGBFU Sony D-FJ041 CD Walkman Portable CD Player with AM/FM Tuner], but it will not house the unit -- it is too small. Now I'm stuck with this case and still seeking one to house the Sony Walkman, which I am very pleased with initially."
3,Worse than I expected,"Problems:1. If you are an obese man, there is a big chance it won't fit you. I am not extremely fat, and I was lucky that at maximum length it fit me.2. Whoever designed this case was a really stupid person, or has never seen a Sony CD Walkman. The front of the case should have been transparent, at least where the buttons are, so that you can select the tracks in a non-consecutive order, you can switch to radio etc. Instead they left a window for the display, like I would be interested in reading it when I wear the player on my belt.3. It is a very snug fit, so even if you wanted to take out the player to switch to radio, you cannot do it, or it's not an easy task to do.Overall, getting this accessory should not influence you, in any way, in choosing Sony or a certain player Amazon has on sale. At least the NF-400 is outstanding..."
1,0 STARS-ACTUALLY! VERY BAD!! DO NOT BUY!!!,"THIS CD CASE IS VERY BAD!! IT CAN""t FIR ANY CD PLAYERS IN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I GAVE UP TRYING TO SQUEEZE IT IN WHEN MY BUTTONS POPED OUT!"
1,cd case,"I thought the Sonycdcase4 was the right size for the Sony MP3 walkman that I purchased at the same time, but it was too small."
1,Does not fit Sony NF 340,Well constructed...tight fit but OK. HOLES ARE NOT RIGHT FOR THE SONY N-DF340 MODEL...CAN FIND NO APPROPRIATE UNIT ADVERTISED ON AMAZON...IT IS USELESS BUT IS MORE EXPENSEVE TO SEND BACK THAN TO KEEP...WHITE ELEPHANT!Sony D-NF340 CD Walkman & MP3 Player w/FM Tuner
3,for a sacred balance...,"While Mr Suzuki is an interesting educator, and hopefully a concerned citizen, I do question some of his facts. If everyone here wants a true sacred balance, read from both sides of the fence...pickup eco-imperialism by paul driessen, and the skeptical enironmentalist by bjorn lomberg. I'm not saying to take their stuff as gospel, but at least read them.They are eye openers... and both are extremely referenced and researched.One of them is endorsed by the the actual founder of Greenpeace, and the other is written by a former greenpeace member."
5,A truly fascinating documentary.,"Wow. Where do I begin? I was never a Björk fan until a few years ago when she released her album, Medulla. I didn't like it at first, but it soon began to grow on me and a few weeks later I loved it! Soon after, I bought this wonderful DVD.How lucky we are to go behind the scenes of this amazing, intimate and innovative album composed solely of human voices! We follow Björk and other talents as they travel around the world recording and composing the album. It is raw and spontaneous and it's quite fascinating to see Björk in the process of making music. I especially enjoyed the parts with the choir and Rahzel. But really, the whole documentary is great. It runs at a brief, but perfect 50 minutes. I love it and continue to watch it. I highly recommend it, and not only to a Björk fan; even if you're not huge on her, I'm sure it will probably still be interesting for you."
2,Ripped off again...,"The rest of the world gets this DVD with the 5.1 mix of Medulla thrown in. This is interesting stuff, but without the 5.1 mix, it should have been given away with a limited edition of the album."
4,Gives Insight and Explaination To Medulla CD,"I was on the fence as to whether or not I liked ""Medulla"". I had listened to it and I just wasn't feeling it. The day after I bought the CD, I got the DVD. Hearing Bjork's explaination and mindset while she was making the album gave me a different perspective when I listened to the CD again.It's interesting to see what goes into the making of an album"
5,The Buying of the President 2004,"This book is great! Charles Lewis, does an excellent job on the reporting, and stays unbiased and neutral. It should be a required read for anyone who votes. I urge everyone to read the book and stay just as neutral as Charles Lewis. It does not read as ""Republican"" or ""Democrat."" Know what is really going on.....but beware, the infomation could be hazerdous to your Dubaism."
1,Terrible,Awful ashtray it broke the first day of use. It did not work at all. I was looking forward to using it Inferior item
2,Okay for the money.,"If you are an occassional smoker, this is the one for you. The batteries don't last very long so if you are someone who smokes alot, spend a little more and get the better one."
3,filters for the smokeless ashtray,"this filter is ok, it really sucks up the smoke from cigs or cigars and easy to clean, but they are not worth buying because the ashtray brakes down from the ashes,and it stops working no matter how many times you clean the inside and out side of the ashtray."
1,UNABLE TO TRY BECAUSE ASHTRAY CAME FAULTY,UNABLE TO TRY THE REPLACEMENTS BECAUSE ASHTRAY CAME BROKEN AND COMPANY HAS YET TO REPLACE IT. VERY SLOW TURN AROUND REPLACEMENTVERY DISSAPOINTED
3,Strong-chorus-weak-verse syndrome,"3 1/2With an undeniable energy, this female rock trio sometimes straddle a fine line between blown-out beautiful, interestingly upbeat, and annoyingly uptight. Weather each particular song on this album falls into any category mostly depends on this stand-out vocalist's memorable, or lack thereof, contrast to the semi-witty interplay."
3,"Pop rock and the go-gos, could get old...","Sleater Kinney is actually a street in Canada. This femme-de-Portland trio revived a tone of rock that has long been forgotten: the riff. Riff rock was characturized by such greats as Hendrix or Zepplin. However, these bands have deep roots, and the waters of time don't really wash them away. Sleater Kinney has a habit of impressing listeners for the first few times, due to a complete shift in tone. But, the more it spins, the more all the colours morph into a blandness. ""One Beat"" is technically the best CD produced by Sleater Kinney to-date. But, don't expect it not to get old."
2,ehh....wishy washy,"It's ok, in my opinion Sleater Kinney has strayed so far from riot grrl, they don't even riot anymore. They're just a talented female rock band. For us Sleater Kinney collecters it's deffinetly something to own, but if you're new to them... start with Call the docter, or self titled. The best part about this album is Stephen Trasks envolvment in it! If you are interested in him check out Hedwig and the Angry Inch."
2,Depressed Long-Time Fan,"It genuinely pains me to say this, but One Beat is a huge let down on many fronts. Sleater Kinney is one of my favorite bands and I still swear by Dig Me Out and The Hot Rock, but something has happened to the band that began with All Hands on the Bad One and has culminated in this album: theres a distinct lack of good melodies. Sure, One Beat has lots of energy, and they are tight and play really well, but apart from tracks 1 (title song) and 2 which are really good, the rest is filler. Lots of melodies that dont go anywhere to the point that I find myself fast forwarding track after track because I just cant take the lack of a decent tune. I should mention that I listened to the entire album 8 or 9 times before I wrote this review so as not to rush to judgement. I'm hoping that Sleater pulls out of this artistic rut and puts out another album worthy of their greatness like Dig or Hot Rock."
4,"a little too political, but that's OK","Quick -- name the best female trio in music this year. Okay, have you got it? If you guessed Sleater-Kinney, you'd be correct. If you guessed the Dixie Chicks, you either have a sick sense of humor or you've undoubtedly stumbled across the wrong kind of list; try VH1 or Rolling Stone instead. If you passed this little pop quiz of sorts, chances are I don't need to tell you about the merits of these gals. 'One Beat', their sixth album, follows in the same vein as their previous releases; political statements abound. Particularly attention-grabbing is their post-9/11 rants in ""Combat Rock"". For those of us who prefer a little less mixing of politics and music, there's plenty else to like here. The abrasive guitars, the urgency in vocal delivery, the furious drumming... oh, yes, the drumming; it's all here in its unbridled glory. Easily the most mature and accessible album to date from this cult band."
5,Rock your socks right off!,"This album will absolutely knock those socks right of your feet. Their vocals are absolutely stirring and man are they tight! I just saw these ladies play one of the best shows I have ever been to the other nite, I left the show absolutely awestruck. Their presence on stage was so captivating (Go ladies with your cover off the BOSS, can I just say, oh my god!). I can't begin to explain why you should buy this album, buy any of their albums, Dig me out, or Call the Doctor, just to name a few (even though Janet, the most amazing drummer alive, isn't on the Doctor). These ladies speak volumes in their songs, songs that will actually touch you, make you think, and just when you think you got it, you need to go back and listen again. Play it loud, then play it over and over. Let these ladies stir your soul, as they have stirred mine."
4,Educational and confusing at the same time,"Jenner & co. have produced a very, very interesting DVD on a very, very difficult matter; and although there are examples ad lib. I miss out on the ""basics of ventilation"", a chapter that might turn this educational production into a ""must see"" for everyone in the project of constructing (or changing) a pigeon loft. I feel left back with an impression of ""this just might work"" - not the ABC of ""how to make it work"" - but perhaps this is the essence of the matter: no ""one solution fits all"" do exist in reality. At least any person watching this DVD will definitely be armed with a lot of inspirations and ideas."
3,good concept,"I agree with an earlier review. I, too, am an avid listener, and enjoy the buttons and witty songs used on the shows. I think the best buttons are the ones chosen specifically for the theme of the story and used only once. So they aren't on this CD. Nevertheless, this is an eclectic collection, even if they don't jar my memory the same way that a ""This American Life"" collection would. I recommend that you listen to the samples of these buttons prior to the purchase of this CD to see if any are recognizable to you. Whether you purchase it or not, you should visit the npr website which has listings and downloads of the songs and buttons used on all things considered and all songs considered."
4,great,my daughter loves dora and diego. it's nice to see both of them together. but Diego has a much deeper voice on this video
5,Great Dora!,"My two-year old loves this Dora DVD. Meet Diego! is by far in the top 10. And, I didn't mind watching it five million times."
4,We love Dora and Diego!,"This was our first Dora DVD and we are pretty pleased. I like the addition of Diego and his unique talent (talking to animals). I think he compliments Dora well and don't think it detracts from the strengths of the show. I agree with an earlier review... my biggest annoyance with the video is that you can't play all four episodes at once, you have to go through a separate menu to get to the Bonus episodes. My kids particularly like the animal focus and will watch this video as often as we let them (they are 20 months and 3 1/2). We will purchase other DVDs based on the positive experience with this one."
1,Misleading Product Description,"I purchased this DVD for my two-year old, who I'm raising to be bilingual. The product description indicates the DVD comes in English and Spanish. It does NOT. The episodes are in English only! Do NOT purchase this DVD if you need it in both languages."
3,Not bad if you don't mind some noise,The fan is extremely loud even on low settings. The unit is also quite heavy (80lbs). Does a good job at cooling the room down but makes alot of fan noise.
3,"some interesting characters, but ...","The book contained some interesting characters, but the timing of the body's discovery was really too coincidental. So if you don't mind that, you'll probably enjoy it."
4,The Horror of Midnight Matinee,"Reminds me of early 80's horror , great use of a plunger,also some really cool cameos,a must see if you love low budget horror...."
1,Out of the frying pan into the fire,"While it is nice to someone admit that the LaHaye/Lindsey rapture cult is based on fantasy rather than the Bible, Rushdooney's dreams of a fundamentalist political state are actually worse. The worse that we can expect from Left Behinders is a massive glut of bad fiction and bad Bible studies. The Rushdooney crowd wants to force us all into their fantasy whether we like it or not. The Kingdom of God is a spiritual communion, not a theocratic police state."
2,Missing parts...extremely disappointed,I was very excited to get such an amazing deal on this shifter kit for my 74 chevy nova. We also ordered the console that goes to it thru amazon as well.The plate and mounting hardware were nowhere to be found in the package. All we recieved was the boot. We are unable to use this as we have no plate/hardware and will be e-mailing to complain.
4,One disk or two?,"I bought this for my two and a half year old son, used through market place here on Amazon. The plastic container it came in had two separate places for disks, but there was only one disk in the package, which contained all of the episodes listed here which leads me to wonder... what was on the other missing disk? Either way, for the price and how many episodes that are included, it was well worth it. It's a nice peaceful cartoon for little ones and I highly recommend it."
5,Comforting & entertaining,"What a sweet comfort to be able to pop in this Little Bear DVD when your little one is under the weather. The episodes that revolve around not feeling your best are cute & funny. My toddler always laughs on ""A Flu"" when cat drinks up Little Bear's broth and the scene where the honey pours all over Little Bear never fails to give him the giggles.I wish all the Little Bear shows would come out on DVD. I would sure love to have them. I can even enjoy watching it. I sure can't say the same for Elmo."
5,Cute little stories of common illness,"The familiar Little Bear music introduces each episode. Every story addresses a series of common child ailments, including flu and sweet-induced indigestion. I have noticed that young people are quite attracted by ""medical topics"": It makes them feel comforted that they are not alone when they get ill, and somehow calms and reassures them. With such a sweet character, these Little Bear episodes are a sure winner. We can even get ready or cook in the meantime!"
3,Not bad.,"Masters of Horror: Haeckel's Tale (John McNaughton, 2006)McNaughton (Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer) turns in his entry in the first series of Masters of Horror with an adaptation of a Clive Barker joint. In it, Ernst Haeckel (Push, Nevada's Derek Cecil) is forced to seek shelter during a storm, and finds it with the Wolframs-- a husband (AVP2's Tom McBeath) whose first name we never learn, and his young, beautiful wife Elise (Black Christmas' Leela Savasta). Haeckel, of course, finds her as delicious as the meal he's offered, and Wolfram, oddly, has no problem with that, but there's a great deal more to this odd little story than Wolfram's letting on-- and, as is always the way with rash young men in love, Wolfram has no choice but to let Haeckel discover the family secret for himself, with amusing consequences. Features a very amusing turn from McNaughton's Homicide: Life on the Street crony Jon Polito as a fortune teller. Fun stuff, this. ***"
2,Interesting twist on love,"This is by far one of the most interestingly morbid love stories I have seen in the Masters of Horror series. The plot has a good story but is alittle to morbid for my taste. The end is definently a twist I was not expecting. If you liked House of a 1000 corpses, you might like this movie. It's kind of the same morbid twist."
4,"Blood, nudity, zombie orgies...you can't go wrong!","Now that's true love! A twisted story of sex with the ex. And his other zombie friends. What's not to love? The morbid naked chick is pretty hot!This idea could have been even much more gross, disgusting, and fun. I'd love to see an extended X-rated sequel. This great movie was recommended to me by my friend Music Man, I beleive. Definitely worth checking out for you horror fanatics..."
1,just refer to Jeff Lippincott,"I've read Jeff's review and thought he's a bit harsh, and maybe a dummy like me still find use in the book, so I decided to buy the book. Turns out i cant agree with Jeff Lippincott's comment more. (seriously, just read his, very nicely written) Not sure what book to suggest as a alternative, since i'm still in the looking, but just NOT this book. thanks."
1,not up to par,I got this camera to upgrade from my 3.1mp camera and was very disapointed. Though it was easy to work the pictures were blurry and dark most of the time and after a while i went back to using my old camera. I plan on giving it to the kids. Photo quality does not matter that much to them. Spend your money on another camera
3,Great pictures... under certain conditions...,"The pictures and video turn out great, you just need the PERFECT lighting. If you're closer than 10 feet to whoever you're using the flash on the picture will turn out terribly bright and they'll just be a white blob... it takes about 15 seconds to take a picture after you've just taken one and that's WAY too long... but it is MUCH better than the digital camera I got with my Marlboro Points!!!!!!"
1,Spend a little more and get a decent camera... this thing sucks.,"Talk about a realization. Took one dozen pics with it and was disappointed. Do not even compare the results from this camera with a camera costing 3-4 times as much. This might be a good kids camera, but that is all. For adults, we need to spend rela money for quality shots. Repeat, this camera sucks. It is in the dumpster awaiting trash pick-up, as I could not return it after opening."
2,A major disappointment,"This camera is not remotely worth the money. Most pictures are blurry, washed out, or dark. The software crashes on WinXP Pro. My old 1.3M Olympus was heavy, slow and a battery drinker but it had great usability, optics and nice pics. This DXG is small, light, and the LCD looks great but what good is all that when it can't take a decent picture?"
1,Terrible camera!,I would expect better pictures from a $10 camera. We've only been able to get a couple of decent pictures after trying it out for a week. Way too bright with flash on inside and way too dark with flash off. Outside pictures are blurry and color is bad. Faces are washed out. Read the book and keep fiddling with it but it's just not working. Save your money and go get a Cannon or Olympus. Even the 3 MP will be far superior to this one.
5,Great beginner digital camera,"This is my first digital camera and it is great for what I need it to do. It takes good, high quality photographs. Though, if you are more of a professional photographer, or want to take pictures of your kids playing, or running pets, etc, then this might not be for you. It's good for landscapes, and portraits. For me, it's a great camera."
4,Saturn V Launch Vehicle Model,"I had wanted a good model of the Saturn V for several years since I was Programming Systems Engineer on two Saturn V launches back in the 60's. This model was a good size for display in my artifact room. It was delivered ahead of time and was sturdily packed, arriving in good shape. It has decent detail but would have been more effective if the Launch Escape Rocket had been carved instead of painted. I examined this same model in the Saturn store at the Kennedy Space Center and it was priced considerable higher. I am very satisfied with this model and would recommend it!"
3,Excellent model to put onto display,"I present regular talks about astronomy and space related subjects to a mixture of audiences and purchased this model to help to illustrate my talks about the Apollo missions. Because it is made from solid wood, it has a smooth surface finish as indicated by other reviewers and so it not as detailed as other possible choices, however, it is also considerably cheaper than the more expensived alternatives. If you are showing it to younger audiences, I would be very careful to supervise them as I think it would be quite easily damaged, particularly the top part of the rocket and the fins at the bottom. Overall though, it is quite impressive and everyone loves to see it."
4,Pure Genius,"Take a has-been superhero from the '60's and give him asecond shot at television in a talk show format and youhave one of the funniest shows this side of MST3K or theSimpsons in their prime. The interactions are always goodfor a laugh, and each show is better than the previous.Doubt me? Go to the SG:CTC website and read through anyone of the episode transcripts...hilarious. I'd give thisfive stars but I'm saving that for Volume 2."
2,I don't get it.,"I liked things like Frisky Dingo, so I thought I'd like Space Ghost. But to be honest, I can't even see what they were trying to do, I didn't fine it entertaining at all. I'm sorry."
4,Still very funny.,"Funny stuff. Like I'm sure any serial watched one after the other there are some clunkers that leave you thinking ""hey that's wasn't that funny"". Still fun to watch."
4,SG CtoC Volume1,"The first series is pretty good. It gives a good introduction to the show and its characters. There are some wierd people interviewed, but the content is well written fun."
3,Not the best of SGC2C,"I truly love this show. Unfortunately, nearly the entire first disk contains non-hilarious episodes. The second disk is much funnier.(...) It would have been better to put the best episodes on DVD, not just the first few seasons. Still, if you'd rather have some Space Ghost than none at all, this set is worth purchasing."
5,"This is a good show, this is a clean show","This is a GOOD CLEAN SHOW! There is not another comedy on this planet that has made me laugh as hard as this show has. The first season is great, but then again, they are all great. For those that like off-the-wall humor, this show is for you. EVery now and then the guest stars, usually well known actors or musicians on a decline in their career, get a stab or two from the crudely animated muscle head known as Space Ghost. If that is not enough, there are two other characters in the show, Zorak and Moltar. They were originally enemies of Space Ghost in the 60's cartoon, but now they are his slaves providing direction and musical accompaniment.Move aside Leno, Letterman, and O'Brien. You have been outdone."
1,Disappointing DVD,"While Space Ghost Coast to Coast is a great show, this DVD is just plain disappointing. Missing are 6 episodes from the first two seasons. In my opinion, all of these ridiculous ""Volume"" DVDs should be boycotted by all fans. When you are a diehard fan of a show, you want all the episodes, not just some of them. Hold out on this DVD, perhaps Cartoon Network will release ""Season"" DVDs (the same thing happened with the ""Friends"" DVDs: came out with a volume, then seasons). This DVD is a waste of money."
5,It beats Jay Leno,"Not just the best late night show, but THE best show!Highly addictive sci-fi talk show, with space ghost and his enemies interviewing celebs, and occasionally getting by his enemies!This is the longest running comedy show not just on adult swim but even before adult was invented. Back in the 90's the show was edited which didn't include profanity, or sexual talk."
2,Audio/Video not in sync and missing episodes,"i have a few issues with this dvd,first of all the audio is not in sync with the video,so the peoples mouths are still moving even after they spoke.This is very annoying,i dont know if i have a defective dvd or if its like that for everyone,ill probably exchange it next week to see if its like that after the store gets more instock,since i got the last copy in the store.my other issue is the dvd skipped over a few episodes.if the audio and missing episodes were fixed i would have gave this dvd 5 stars,"
1,Disappointment,Given as a Xmas gift thinking it would contain cartoons of Space Ghost aside from SG being a night talk host. I saw the disapointment on the face of the gift receiver.
4,A smile a day keeps the doldrums away,"I think this book is a great little pick-me-up. Whenever I feel the doldrums coming, I read a page and put the thoughts into action."
1,Another one that suffers from poor remastering,"This is the 2nd cd that I purchased, trying to find the same aural pleasure that my Boswell Sisters records had given me. I was SO happy when I found that it existed that I overlooked the less than wonderful sound. Now that there are many different versions of these songs available, I know that I never listened to this because the sound is so dull and lifeless.Listen around and you will find much better remastering for these songs. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,"Presented concepts clearly, please publish solutions.","I liked your book. You presented alot of concepts in a clear manner. However, please publish a solution manual for all chapter problems. Also, please discuss FIFO method in more detail."
2,It's an okay read,"You Are Making Me Wet"" by Earl Sewell - The best story in the book. This story was funny, and sweet. I enjoyed it, and will read this one again.""Life Happens"" by Rique Johnson - was interesting. The story kept my attention.""The Wanting"" by Michael Presley - another interesting story, and it had a nice little hidden message.""Legal Days, Lonely Nights"" by William Fredrick Cooper - This story started off slow, picked up and by then end you were catching your breath.""Somewhere Between Love and Sarcasm"" by V. Anthony Rivers - This was the WORST story in the book. There was nothing erotic about it, and it was no where between love and sarcasm. The story was all Sarcasm and it was stupid and had no business in the book.My suggestion is read all the stories in this book EXCEPT Somewhere Between Love and Sarcasm. Trust me you will not miss anything by not reading this story."
3,.Com Business Only a Partial Success,"I like the concept of novellas, but when publishing one with only 5 or 6 stories, ALL the stories must be on-pointe to capture the readers attention from start to finish. That was NOT the case with sistergirls.com. A book written around an internet theme is a great idea in this age of .com's, but some of the authors in this book fail to address the intrigue, the suspense, the excitement, and most importantly, the erotica around the subject and that left me a bit disappointed. If you buy the book, buy it used."
5,Hot stuff!!!,It took me 3 days to finish the book. I loved Legal Days and Lonely Nights by William Fredrick Cooper and The Wanting by Michael Pressley. All of the stories made me want to search for the characters. The guys did their thing.
1,Uncool boots,These boots fit large and are not nearly as fashionable as they look in the photo. I returned them.
1,Looks nice but not practical.,"Its a shelf queen now. Its fine for ticket stubs, receipts but index cards barely fit in for hipster GTD."
1,Doesn't live up to the hype,I'm so glad that I rented this turkey first instead spending 50 smackers on it. While the graphics are nice they are hardly ground breaking. This didn't hold my attention for more than 15-20 minutes and even then I was looking for an excuse to eject the game from the console. I think ubisoft messed up some where in the gameplay area sure it has elements of twisted metal gta and a few others but that just didn't cut it for me. The controls are the bloody worst thing I've ever had to get used to when trying to drive and shoot at the same time. Better luck next time guys.
2,Worked to begin with,"I purchased this unit at Wal-Mart in September of 2005 and it worked pretty well, but now the DVD recorder has stopped recording discs most of the time and half the time when I put a disc in it tells me there is no disc in the drive. It also freezes up frequently. It will also act like it is recording, but when I go to the title screen there is nothing listed, though the available space showing has gone down. The only blank dvds I found that used to work most of the time were Memorex DVD+R and Ridata DVD+RW in the spindle packs. I have tried a few others and other than a couple of discs they wouldn't record or recognize that they were even in the machine. I am giving this 2 stars because although it doesn't work now, it worked alright for the first couple of months and considering the price was below $100 I figuire I got what I paid for."
2,Don't buy it,"It works ""sometimes"". I had to take my first one back. Don't think I can with this one. If you spend an extra 50-100 dollars we might get one that lasts because in a few months after having this one you'll have to purchase another one anyway. Number one, it doesn't play half of my regular dvds. One time I was watching a movie the thing paused, I had to unplug it to turn it off. Some of my dvd's i've recorded I've noticed that they pause and or jump during the recording. Also, I noticed my local WalMart no longer has these on display. They are jammed in the back, not on main display."
1,A DVD recorder that cannot record DVDs,"I bought my ILO recorder at Walmart and it has been nothing but trouble - it is unreliable and you can never be sure if it will record - keep on getting ""bad disc"" message every time the machine tries to finalize the DVD after recording. I have tried several different types of discs DVD+R and DVD+RW by different manufacturers and still have the same problem - I have stopped trying to record anything on this machine because it is just a waste of my time. The remote control is a nightmare. ILO service is a joke; better to talk to a brick wall rather than try to get help from them. I cannot and will not recommend this machine to anyone - don't waste your money - buy a quality machine from a reputable manufacturer."
1,Pure Junk. Don't buy.,"We have this DVD recorder that did not work properly from day one. We are now trying to contact Ilo to get it replaced under the one-year manufacturers warranty, their customer service line says ""all circuits busy"", and they will not answer questions over the email. Buyer bewares. This company is trouble."
1,Bad in the Worst Ways Possible,"I bought one of these from wal mart 4 or 5 yrs ago. Out of the box it seems to work great. Then I put my trust into it & started recording over the air programs without ""finalizing"" until the disc was full. Big mistake! At the end of the disc this unit would almost always produce a failure resulting in wasted discs and anything you recorded being history! It got even worse with the unit refusing to read ANY dvd only 3 weeks after I bought it. I took mine back for a refund but was curios & done some googling. It turns out the company that made these units cloned a Phillips recorder then went out of business just from wal mart pulling these from the store shelves. Everyone lost money on these including wal-mart when millions of people returned there & the company was out of business. EVERY SINGLE UNIT is bad. If you see one for sale just dont even bother! Too high of a failure rate."
1,Piece of Crap!!!,"I bought this piece of crap about a week ago. It work fine until now. It want format disc it keeps saying ""Error"" I'm taking this back to Wal-Mart and getting my money back. With the money I spent on it I can buy me a DVD Burner for my Computer. So, if your thinking about getting one of this, do yourself a favor and save your money."
2,Confusing and wordy...,"I don't have a problem with, 'No Rapture' arguments but I could only read an hour of this absolutly wordy and overly cross-referencing book. I'm sorry but this is just not worth it."
1,This was a horrible book,"From the begining to the end this book was trash. I only gave one star because I had no other choice. Do not buy or read this book, unless you want to waste money on something. I however did read and enjoy the real left behind series by Tim Lahaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, which I gave five stars for all. This book is just a copy version of a good book that the author Ted Noel made bad."
3,Enjoyed everything but the translation,"It's a testament to the story that I made it all the way through, and even wanted to do so. The tranlation is so poor that I found myself rewriting sentences in my head. I wouldn't be shocked to find that they had simply dropped the novel into Babel Fish and printed the results. Clunky, leaden and at times mystifying, anyone who reads wanting strong writing will find this experience frustrating.As others have said, the book has much more characterization than the movie, and is well paced. The ending was more satisfying than the film, and it works well as a pulp potboiler. Worth reading if you're a fan of the movie, but please please please, Viz, find a new translator."
5,oh god this is a great book!,"Alright, I saw both movies and read the manga before buying this novel, I am obsessed with this serise and enjoyed every moment reading this book, its something you can read more than just once."
5,AMAZING,this book by far is the greatest work i have ever had the pleasure of reading. i quite literally could not put it down. i was in Kuwait on my way back from Iraq and my buddies had to make me go to chow because i didn't want to stop reading.
4,Battle Royale,"I picked up this book after watching the movie of the same name. Being a consumer of media that promotes sensless violence, I was much impressed with the movie. I assumed, and was not mistaken, that the novel would take a deeper look into character motivations. Not unlike Heinlen (Starship Troopers), there is a political message in the book that was not translated into the movie. The story itself is both uplifting and disturbing. 42 students on an island forced to kill one another or die. Who can you trust, if everyone else's life depends on you dying? This novel has more backstabbing and strategizing than a season of survivor, but will suprise you in the end. This book is not recommended for children. Parents read this book before you let your older children read it. It does have some sexual refrences and alot of violence. Everyone else should read this book, and try to understand the political message, Think, Learn, and Speak. Enjoy!"
1,"OK Story, Terrible Writing","The style of the writing is immature and trite. I didn't like how the author thinks he is clever with his digressions in the middle of almost every chapter. Also, he likes to point out every single little bit of minutiae to the reader not allowing us to draw any conclusions on our own or use the context to get those details. The thing is that most of the time those bits of information are not even important to story, they simply serve to distract you. Then there's the little glimpses into the characters mind which were sometimes OK, but switching between third and first person perspective is annoying unless the author knows how to implement it. Honestly, it was like a fifth-grader wrote this book."
1,battle royale - what's the point,"Killing for the sake of killing is boring. Most of this book I skimmed through quickly. THe last 5 chapters or so I read in depth, hoping to figure out the big picture. Still confused. Two kids get away with help of another kid. Hope lives under totaltarian government???? Maybe I'm losing something through language/cultural translation. I guess I'll spend some more time with other reviews. Maybe someone else figured it out."
2,Completely lost in translation,"I came with high expectations when purchasing the novel in Barnes & Noble, and I think that was my first mistake.The book has an interesting idea as a premise; kill your classmates/friends in order to survive a government-run program. I get it. But after the first couple of deaths, all the pretty blood and guns simply meshed together in the book. Character growth in this story is almost obsolete; save for the one time Noriko actually gets a gun and reloads it(gasp!).It limps and staggers by simply offering the reader cliches and an overabundance of Mary-Sue's, weak or imbalanced women and one gay steroetype that I'm sure is as equally offensive. The book is hard to read not because of so many long words (that's sarcasm folks), but because of so many needless adjectives and sentences (Who needs to know what direction the object is pointing when he gives it to the boy?)The book does have some allegorical truth to it, but the authors writing killed it. (no pun intended)"
5,Why is every review so long?,"This book is great!Yes there is violence. Yes it is necessary. No it is not gratuitous. No it is not banned in the USA. Yes it has something to say... Read the book and find out for yourself.Personal note: Stephen King recommended this book in Entertainment Weekly and it is much like his story ""The Long Walk"" (written under an alias) which I read years and years ago - and still think about often. Sorry, but this book will make you think. Please, don't hurt your brain."
3,Nice complement to The Hunger Games,This is really more of 3.5 stars.I picked up this book because I loved The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and I heard this Japanese book was very similar to it or The Hunger Games was similar to it. Battle Royale wasn't bad but I much preferred The Hunger Games. This one had way too many characters to keep track of (there were over 40 students) and there were too many mini story lines coming out as each student is killed. It was kind of funny in a morbid sort of way that some of the weapons the students are given are forks or sticks. Talk about raw deal when other students are given machine guns. If you enjoyed The Hunger Games and have time on your hands(Battle Royale is over 600 pages long) this is a nice complement to it.
3,Junk food for the brain,"Nothing spectacular, but well worth the read. It's a violent, entertaining pulp piece, though I wonder what of the style, form, and prose are lost in translation.Read it. Enjoy it. Just don't expect a masterpiece. It's a gene-spliced lab baby of Lord of the Flies, Beverly Hills 90210, LOST! and Surviving the Game"
5,Blood stained novel will take you on one pessimistic ride.,"Battle Royale is the novel that the world wide hit film (except the United States) is based on. The story follows a middle school class as they are hijacked by the government and forced to play a deadly game on a deserted island. The class is pared into two groups (boys and girls). To add some fun, each student is given a random weapon (anything from a high powered rifle with a laser scope to a paper fan). Another bonus, a couple of new transfers are thrown into the mix.What I enjoyed the most about this novel was the background story of the students. The writer finds the time to flesh out their characters and make them intersting. You'll feel for the students knowing that death awaits each and every single one of them. Who will survive and what will become of them?Highly recommended."
3,Mediocre and mildly-entertaining,"When I saw the film that was based on this novel of the same name, I was on the edge of my seat. When I read the book, I just wanted to get the whole experience over. ""Battle Royal"", for me, was one of those books that, despite an original premise, turns out to be poorly written and unexciting. The pacing in the book is dreadfully abysmal and the characters are all a tad bit too annoying for my taste. The dialogue is ridiculous, cliche, and unimaginative. I don't know if this is a product of poor translation, but the book suffers for it. On the bright side, the concept is an exciting fresh look at Kafka-esgue fascism, and it is gory (if that is your thing). All in all, ""Battle Royale"" is a tedious yarn that tries too hard to be something that it cannot be: a great sci-fi novel."
5,My Only Addiction,"My sister introduced me to vanilla chai several years ago, our favorite being Dunkin Donuts vanilla chai which is no longer available. We, then, went on a quest to find another ""favorite vanilla chai"". We definitely found it in Pacific Vanilla Chai. While I liked it best when it was available in the striped bags rather than in the canisters (don't know why), it is excellent. I recommend this beverage to anyone who enjoys tea. As their slogan says, it really is ""the taste of peace and quiet"". Enjoy!"
4,Perfect for College Students,My daughter is away at college and had mentioned that she missed having her Chai tea because she can't store milk at the dorm. Ran across this at the grocery store and figured I would send it. She loved it and wants more. It was perfect for storing because it was dry and with an electric tea pot she can have a nice warm cup of chai anytime she wants. When I found the six pack here on Amazon much cheaper then at the grocery store I knew that this was the item to stock up on. We have tried it at home and it is a nice change from tea.
4,"Small containers, LARGE taste","After searching for a healthy alternative to grocery store creamers, I settled for the corn syrup solids in the Pacific Chai dry mix found here. The taste is great, and requires a smaller amount of mix to produce a high level taste. The six containers that came in this package were perfect for shipping overseas to a peace Corps volunteer family member in need of a taste from home. Recommended for a better taste in dry mixes than grocery store options commonly found on shelves."
2,"Clashes with companion ""Men's Wardrobe""","I have previously read ""Men's Wardrobe"" from Chic Simple and found it very good. Bought ""Shirt & Tie"" by the same authors, hoping for more of the same quality. Sorry to say it was sadly missing. Shirt & tie is a much abreviated edition. Small in size, small in information. I in fact managed to read it on breaks before I even got it home from work. Color Photos and a crisp layout can't make up for the lack of content. Finished the book and came off with the feeling that it could have been very good. Even the shirt & tie combos given as examples of what worked together didn't. Better off staying with the larger, more informative Men's Wardrobe."
1,Is this book supposed to be funny?,"Because it's not. Most of the 'tidbits' in here can be found on most email forwards. There is nothing original about this book, and it's really kind of passive-agressive in it's attempts to portray 'family harmony.'And how interesting it is that all the positive reviewers have only written one review ever for Amazon. I'm sure, since this review is negative, one of said reviewers will object to this, but, before you base a purchase decision on positive praise, make sure you take that praise with a grain of salt and question why this was the only book those who love this book ever reviwed."
3,"Amusing, Not bad","The book is pretty funny. Not the marriage book to end all marriage books, but there is a little something for most people to take away from it and apply in their own lives. It lacks a certain personality and some of the advice is unscriptural so I only gave it a three.The Televisionwithoutpityers (twopers as they call themselves) are now discussing how to write reviews that stick to the rules and make it appear as though they read the book, in order to ""hit her [the author] in the pocketbook"" because that's ""the only thing that hurts people like that."" This is a regular practice; they didn't like one conservative family on one documentary who had a lot of children and started trying to get those children taken away by social services!!!Amazon, however, has a high standard and I hope that they continue to remove disruptions designed to impede and compromise the integrity of the review process.Overall: worth reading but perhaps not worth buying new."
1,very disappointing and very tame.,"I didnt know what to expect when I bought this movies but i guess you get what you pay for. In this Dvd, all the women did was dance around a pole or move about on a table to cheesy music. Compared to any strip club that i have ever been in, these girls were very tame. If you are the type of person that likes women just dancing about doing nothing, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, dont give decadent dreams a second thought and find something that isnt as cheesy."
4,Coming Alive from Nine to Five in a 24/7 World,This textbook arrived VERY quickly. I was really relieved since I ordered it late. It was in good condition with some writing inside (nothing too distracting).
3,Coming Alive,The book was in great condition and received as advertised. I would like a next-day delivery option.
3,9-5 acceptable,The shipper said the book would be acceptable and it was. There was some water damage and frayed pages...but that's what I paid for. It came in a timely manner and I'm just happy to have it :)
5,Great Album,"This album is really fantastic. It is a great peek into Johnny Mercer tunes, with some really delightful arrangements by Hubert ""Tex"" Arnold. ""Jamboree Jones"" is a personal favorite of mine as well as ""Goody Goody"""
1,Only 5 scientists disagree with evolution?,"In this now 9 year old video, a mere 5 scientists voice their concerns with Evolutionary Theory.I would direct those of you who think 5 scientists is alot to the National Center for Science Education website - ""http://www.ncseweb.org/article.asp?category=18"" where they have Project Steve. Project Steve is a collection of ONLY scientists named Steve who agree with a statement endorsing Evolution. That is about 1% of all scientists. So far over 700 Steve's have signed it.If 700 Steve's agree evolution is a good science idea, why can't you?"
1,Pseudoscience,"More rubbish by the religious right to misrepresent scientific fact. The video selects facts that support its assertions(poorly in most cases) and ignores a vast amount of others that refute the videos claims against evolution. For those who are unfamiliar with the way science works or who have already decided not to believe in evolution, this video will tell you what you want to hear. It will not tell the truth."
5,Bright Smile,With the right amount of peroxide this provides noticeable results without leaving my teeth sensitive. I researched other percentages and have found that anything over 16% is too much peroxide and have left a very uncomfortable feeling in the teeth and gums.This gel is very effective that only a little is required for each use. I personally don't use the required marked amounts as I found it was too much for me but the markings are a great help if you aren't sure how much to use.Comes with a separate twist applicator to apply the gel and a twist on capped piece to ensure the gel doesn't leak and is also great for traveling with.
3,"Cute, but trite.","As a sixteen year old girl, it can be difficult to find movies to watch with my parents. This one certainly qualified for that--it was moderately funny, had hardly any language, no ""bedroom scenes"" as my mother calls them, and ended happily. What violence there was revolved mostly around teenage boys acting tough. The basic premise--delinquent boys taken from civilization to learn how to shape up on a cattle ranch--was appealing enough. Practically everything that happened in the movie was a cliche, though. I knew how the movie would end before the opening credits were up. Still, it's something inoffensive to watch with the folks."
2,"Drugs, Juvenile crime, corrupt judge, happy ending","I am truly sorry having to give TWO STARS to a ""feel good"" movie with bad guys loosing, highly bias Judge developing a heart, horses, motorcycles and one good cleavage shot. The story is so predictable that it telegraphs everything that is going to happen. The three bad kids are bad, but are easily controlled by an ex-con that now works at the ranch with the help of a former marine ex-cop and an old washed up cowboy. Good star lineup but even with some good acting the plot is a bit to weak."
5,people on here on wrong,a lot of these reviews are wrong. all of these dvd+a's can be ripped to your ipod/zune. and the sound is not the same as the cd's you've been listening to all these years. the mix on monster is completely different and new. and this is from listening on the zune with earphones. i just wanted to let people who are on the fence about getting these.as i was on the fence as well due to the fact that i don't have a dvd+a player and the only new feature added is worthless to me. not now. now i can have newly mixed and mastered sound for all the r.e.m. warner albums. which were needing it. and it's not the crappy loud remastering they're doing nowadays either.
3,Rex is correct,"Of course Rex is absolutely correct about this disc, and it seems that Mark does not understand the functions of this disc at all."
5,Prayer is not difficult,"I started reading Michel Quoist back in the 60's. There are many prayers in his book but succinct and powerful. I will never forget reading, ""A Priest's Prayer on a Sunday Night."" I cried and still do when I think of it. He is so sensitive and had an impact on my life. He is one Priest that I would have loved to spend a day with just listening to him. God bless him. I highly recommend this book, no matter what denomination the reader shares in."
4,Still a good introduction,"Its hard to find a good introduction to the life and teachings of Jesus and this book fills that gap. Stewart's book is dated (both in style and scholarship), but still very helpful. In brief, accessible chapters, he is able to convey a lot of content in a manner that is devotional as well as informational. I use this in a class setting and inevitably, people will report that he helped answer questions they have had and put together things they hadn't noticed before. Maybe someday someone will write a better book that covers the same material and serves the same purpose, but until then, this is still a good introduction."
2,Host cable might damage your toshiba PDA,"I bought this cable to use a regular USB keyboard with my Toshiba e350. But the keyboard I'm using does not work with it - ppc recognizes something, but says ""device has been shut down - please disconnect"". However it works with mouse if you get additional drivers.What is really dangerous: the connection to ppd is very unstable (mechanically), and after several unwanted ""unpluggings"" it damaged the metal pins inside the ppc! It seems that I cannot synchronize anymore :-("
4,Some things don't change...And that's a good thing!,"This is Ivy at their best. I've been a fan of Ivy's for a while now and up until this point my favorite album was probably ""Realistic."" But Ivy stretches their sound on this album; up-tempo songs like ""Thinking About You"" really aren't typical Ivy, but they really make it work. Songs like ""Four in the Morning"" and ""Feel So Free"" could easily be off any Ivy album. These clean, melodic, yet slightly somber songs are Ivy's home turf.So far, my favorite songs on this album are ""Thinking About You"" (they owe a lot to New Order's sound on ""Republic"" for this song) and ""Ocean City Girl."" I haven't heard anything this catchy since Phoenix's ""United"" (I listened to ""If I Ever Feel Better"" for a year straight and never tired of it).""In The Clear"" is a great album. I highly recommend it."
5,back at the top of their game,"if you were a little disappointed with the excessively mellow electronic noodling on Long Distance, Ivy's latest release will set your mind at ease. this album sounds a lot more like their earlier stuff-- it's all catchy guitar hooks and great melodies to complement the breathy splendor of Dominique Durand's vocals. highlights include ""tess don't tell"" and ""corners of your mind."" this album is a real treat and it's great to see Ivy return to what they do best."
2,sadly lacking,"No discernible emotion here...just formulaic. Nothing like the gentle gems of ""Long Distance"""
5,"""The best example of the Latin Revolution""","Since i listened this compilation i havent stopped to play it. The music elements that this latin band uses is simply awesome. you can find infinity of styles like ska, reggae, rock and a lot more... the really fans of los fabulosos cadillacs will not find a real deal buyin' it, except for the 2 unedited songs, but for all the others that want to pick a real winner grab this cd inmediately!!!!"
2,Not too good,"Don't work good with a regular arc welding machine. Tried but very bad result, may be I don't know what I was doing."
2,"Nice title, shame about the content","Plenty of general information is presented in a reasonably fluid style, but when it comes to the nitty gritty - like costs, as mentioned by another reviewer, Anne Hammick takes the easy route.The book is also beginning to date, and some of her admitted personal bias is even less appropriate now than it was when the book was first written.A capsize phobia is understandable (I suffer vertigo myself) but to dismiss multihulls so casually indicates a partiality that defeats the object of a book with this title. For example, a snide comment about Wharram cats spending time on the beach reveals her ignorance of the prime uses of shallow-draught multis.If you are already determined to go cruising in the exact same manner as Anne Hammick, this book will reinforce your decisions, but it lacks the balance and depth to be a serious work of reference. Could do better."
3,Not much about Budget!,Althought this book is interesting it really doesn't cover the subject of budget the way I had hoped. Most of the information in the book has been written before by many others and so I found it to be a little redundant.
3,Good enough for Skype,"I bought this mic primarily for Skype, and it works well enough for that. I discovered that I needed to enable my sound card's microphone boost feature in order for the sound to be picked up decently. I would not recommend this microphone if you are trying to record your voice, like to narrate a video."
4,Does what it's supposed to,Works fine no issues on my end simple plug in is all it really needs. Shipping take a bit long but overall the product is good
2,works but bad overall,The Labtec verse 524 desktop mic actually work for a cheap product it is made of all cheap light and very breakable plastic if you handle this item without care it will fall apart and it does produce sound but it is very tiny you wil have to scream into it for it to record loud sound but when you do that all you hear is this static and loud hissing noise this mic in my opinion is not worth the money even though it is already cheap as dirt.
3,Labtec Verse 524 Desktop Mic,"Wow, what can I say about this product that hasn't already been said. This product although serving its purpose is quaint to say the least. The microphone itself was extremly low and I had to yell into it in order to receive an audible voice that I could hear on my speakers. Overall, don't pay over $10 for this item as it is not worth more than that."
3,Not what i expected,This was not a light read or all that insightful. Felt like a scientific review.
2,disappointing,"This is journalism posing as something more scholarly, and you would expect more from a Gender Studies professor with these credentials. She has interviewed many women from different generations but never specifies their number, background, age, class, or race. Thus all of her conclusions have a basis in fuzziness. Furthermore, she will generalize about a decade by turning to an example of a topic's treatment in a popular film, as if that treatment is parallel to someone's else account of their reality as a wife. You are unlikely to learn anything new if you have already been reading on this topic. Far better is Stephanie Coontz' recent book on marriage."
3,Noise a Problem,"Very good music muddled by background noise, pops and scratches. If you have a high tolerance for these defects, go ahead and buy. I am okay with a certain amount of noise and ended up saving 11 tracks. The rest went to the recycling bin. These must have been transferred from the original 78's. It's a shame that these aren't available in remastered version with some noise reduction. I know music purists hate this technology, but if these songs had been remastered and cleaned-up, I'd keep all the tracks."
3,"Five star dictionary, one star shipping","I think this is a great dictionary, but if you decide to order it be aware that Amazon seems to have particular difficulty in shipping it, or perhaps their copies are damaged. I say this because the first copy I received from Amazon had split bindings. Imagine opening the front cover and razoring the seam between the cover and the binding. Repeat the process inside the back cover. Amazon was very nice about letting me replace it: they shipped a replacement copy the next day, UPS picked up the damaged one, no charge for anything.Unfortunately, the replacement copy arrived in EXACTLY the same state. That had to go back as well. So you should get a copy, but it make take a few tries before you get one in usable condition."
1,Save your money,"The game is awful. I bought it, and thank goodness I only paid about 7.00 for it. I get to a certain point and I can't do anything else with it. It was terrible. Even the ""patch"" from the website did not work."
1,disappointment,"Isn't the ""political"" I was thinking of. This about going to war, etc. with other countries. I was hoping to be running for offices. Maybe starting with senator or congressman, eventually being a presidental candiate- campaining, debating with other candidates, etc. Or maybe being president, and making decisions- passing, vetoing bills, etc.If anyone knows of a better ""political"" game, please tell us people who are disappointed with this game."
2,gets boring!,I liked this game for the first few days but could never beat it. It gets boring and is tough to beat.
4,Not what I expected but a decent game.,"I bought this, thinking it would be like the third world war on the old sega cd. It has similar situations but this game is senerio based with different objectives to obtain. I am giving the game 4 stars cause it's just one of those games where when you start to learn how it works, you just can't walk away till the world has been dominated. But beware, the later senerios are quite hard and your enemys are alot more aggressive. Have fun playing."
2,Pheobe is Alright I suppose,Pheobe is the serious one of the four sisters in Marilyn Kayes SISTERS series.Her latest cause is trying to stop a young-adult book series with sexual references from being banned.
3,Pretty but tiny,"This is a cute little chest. It is not as big as I would have liked it to be, I could not fit half of my baby's toys in this chest. It's well crafted though."
2,Please reprint this book ASAP,"As previous reviewers have noted, this book must be reprinted. The errors have been detailed at length by previous reviewers and I won't bore you by repeating them.Suffice it to say that if it's a 'must have' because a teenager is considering a career in meterology then perhaps it's worth getting this edition. However if you can wait, it's best to wait for the second edition when errata can be corrected.That last piece of advice goes for nearly every reference book and piece of software."
1,ANGRY ANSWER!,"This company who sell the product, get very angry when you complain because you haven't received the product. Neither gives you a tracking number or any kind of help to let you get your product. You are not sure if you lost your money."
3,Mostly entertaining,"Karo is consistently amusing. As a college student, I object to his repetitive portrayal of his four-year keg party as something every college student aims for; actually, I thought that was sad. As a female college student, my worst fears about frat boys have been confirmed. None of that stopped me from laughing at his descriptions of dorm life and dry cleaners. Recommended for light reading, if taken with a grain of salt."
4,"good read, but the e-mail version was better","I love Ruminations. I still have some of the original e-mail versions I got, and they're still insanely funny. I think they are funnier than the book, as some of them have been changed to be less offensive, but it's great that they got published at all. I love the fact that a kid with the talent to show the humorous side of college in such a witty manner could get this kind of recognition. This is a great read for any college student, pre, post, or otherwise. It's a great representation of what college is really about. Way to go Karo!!"
5,very good,"Very true stories about college life, my only complaint is that the book is too short. I found myself hi-liteing(sp) quotes in this book to share with friends later when I was supposed to be hi-liteing ""real"" books for classes. Can't wait for ""Twenty-something life"" as I am the same age as the author. This book shows us that the college experience is pretty much the same everywhere, I had similar good times at Eastern Michigan University from 97-01. Wish Karo would come to the Ann Arbor area on his comedy tour!"
5,What College is REALLY like...,"Wow...I read the entire book in three hours - and I was crying because I laughed so hard. Anyone who's ever been in college or going through it presently, will definitely understand what Aaron Karo is talking about. Parents who have college kids NEED to read the book too - so you understand that random hook-ups and drinking until you puke IS normal even though is doesn't seem like it is. Karo covers everything from crazy Greek life to crazy professors to that one poster in your dorm room that keeps falling on you while you sleep because you're too lazy to put enough tape on it so that it actually stays up. And is it really a prerequisite to like Dave Matthews? If you've been to college, you'll understand his book and if you've graduated, you may just feel a little nostalgic when you're done reading it."
5,"Snotty, rich, bored American college kids--and proud of it!","I would have liked to have slapped Aaron Karo while reading this book, but I was laughing too hard to keep my hand steady enough. I had been a fan of Ruminations since it was a humble online-only occasional column (and was introduced to it by the excellent Very Pathetic Mailing List). Karo wrote this series of ""Ruminations"" during his tenure at Penn, which of course is one of the most expensive, prestigious, exclusive schools in the country. So how does he spend his time at this great school? Drinking, partying, sleeping, and picking up girls, if you believe him. All I can say is that my parents would have killed me. If you like books about rich kids wasting their rich parents' money on four years of hedonism, read this book. Even if you think you don't like books like that, you'll like this one. You just can't hate Karo and his friends in the book because deep down, all you broke, studious kids are jealous."
2,Not about college life,"This book is not about college life. It is a bunch of short paragraphs. There are no real stories or real characters. I guess there were a few laughs, so it might be a good book to keep on the floor of your bathroom. Some better books about real college life are COLLEGE LIFE EXTREME: Lies, Sex, Drugs and Violence andGoat: A Memoir."
3,Funny to the college student,I bought this book in college and found it to be very entertaining. Now that I've been out of college for a few years I find myself reading through it less and less. This is the kind of book you get as a gift for someone entering college or who's in college. It now sits in a basket on the back of my toilet for 'bathroom' reading time.
4,Get Lucid::: Go Places,"I love this kit, not only because of its beautiful illustrations and helpful suggestions, but for the clary sage oil and visualization tape that comes with it. I'm not promising that you'll get lucid the first time, but with patience and practice, you soon may be going on all sorts of night time adventures. It took me about 5 months of repeated use to get comfortable with the induced lucidity, but it's worth it. If you have ever had a dream that you could control, you are halfway there... the second step is to do it whenever you want to, and this book can help. It also discusses some of the history of dreams and their symbolism."
4,"great ideas, but didn't work on me","This is a beautiful kit! It had spendid ideas for acheiving lucidity, but I find they didn't work for me. Who knows, maybe I'm just braindead. :-) They will most probably work for you!"
4,Casio Digital Watch,Could have bought the watch at Wal Mart without the shipping charge for approximately the same amount.
2,Watch Great - Harness Worthless,"I have now purchased 12 Casico Illuminator Digital Watches. Everyone has suffered a broken harness on both sides of the watch. Some watches last a year. My most recent watch broke yesterday, less than a month since I bought it. Ironically, all the watches themselves still keep perfect time some more than five years later. Understandably, I will not be buying this watch again."
1,Not as advertised,"This watch is kind of ugly, but it was listed as water resistant to 100 meters, which is what I needed. When it arrived, it said it was water resistant, with no depth given. Much research later on Casio's website showed it was not water resistant to 100 or even 50 meters. I returned it immediately."
5,Wish I could give above five stars.,It does exactly what it should and last through a ton of abuse. Survived years outdoors in the tropics. The flaw is with the bands and not the watch but the bands and dirt cheap too.If you want nothing but a trustworthy simple device this is it. If you want fancy or gadgetry then look elsewhere for a lot higher cost.
5,Casio illuminator watch is great,The Casio Illuminator is a great lower cost alternative for their G-Shock watch Great for less strenuous more casual wear
3,Illuminator,I would give this watch four stars if the wrist band didn't break so soon. The wrist band broke after I wore the watch for about 10 months. Great price.
2,not water resistant enough,"I just checked my account to see now I bought this watch in 2008 , so the warranty is gone and all i can share about this is that it failed the swim test earlier this year.. once the water droplets got in, the led numbers are broken and so this watch is no longer watched.. i'm going to be careful with what i buy as for water resistant versus waterproof,, there is a big difference."
4,Four Stars,"I give this watch Four stars, the indiglo really works and lights up very bright and very visual. This watch could be helpful if you work at night and need to document time, its excellent. Pretty cool watch for the price if you ask me"
1,Not as advertised,"The product information of the Amazon site says the watch is water resistant to 330 feet (can withstand splashes, swimming, snorkeling, scuba diving). The watch, according to the instructions supplied with it, is only water resistant (can withstand splashes, but not water from swimming, snorkeling, scuba diving). I purchased the watch to wear when swimming. Seems like a bait and switch."
1,Not a men's watch...,"...it is too small even for a skinny man's wrist! Perhaps this is for pre-teen boys...or girls. Also, it doesn't have a way to set the year. What this means is we will have to set the date more often than in a watch which allows setting of day, month and year."
2,casio mens watch,"the watch arrived on time and in good condition. But, the band broke the first week. Husband was going out of town so we just bought a new band and the watch is working fine. Just to let you know the band was made cheap and broke easily."
4,Great Compilation of Women,"This is a great compilation of songs by women from the 80's and very early 90's. The artists include Wilson Philips, heart, Martika, T'Pau, Taylor Dain, Sweet Sensation, and The Bangles. I was happy with this CD. My only complaint is that ""Heart and Soul"" by T'Pau is a weird remix instead of the original, which is way better. That was only one song though so it was still good."
3,review of study guides,"This book was ok, but it was only minimally helpful as a study tool because it did not offer explanations for answers like many other study guides. I found that other study guides were more beneficial to me for this reason."
3,mediocre,The questions that were on the actual exam were not at all similar to the ones in this book.
5,Excellent Book worth every cent,Beautifully illustrated with tons of large pictures of houses and gardens on every page with notes on each one. Very tastefully put together. Great style which epicts beautiful Japanese living in a more contemporary way. An excellent book for anyone wanting ideas on how to decorate their home or garden in the typical Japanese or Asian style. Also makes a wonderful coffee table book. Very pleased that I bought this.
1,not what I thought,"Bought on my Kindle Fire. The free samples never give a good idea of what the contents will be. Fortunately the generous return policy lets me look through the whole book and decide. The subject is interesting, I'm looking for ideas for my house, but this book wasn't what I needed."
4,Works great - customer support is amazing,"I used this product as a backup battery for a Toshiba portable DVD player. One problem is that it doesn't come with the right size adapter for the Toshiba. I called their support number. They answered right away, and where incredibly helpful. They would have over-nighted me the adapter, but it turns out that Radio Shack's adapters are compatible with the Tekkeon plugs. Worked great."
4,Tekkeon myPower Rechargeable Battery,"Product arrived timely as promised, in excellent condition. Only reason for not getting 5 stars is that it won't charge my Fujitsu LifeBook T4010. It did fit and charge all my other stuff, T3, TX and LifeDrive."
3,Ordered wrong book,"I ordered this thinking it was a textbook with exercises, not realizing it's an instructor's manual. My bad. It will be helpful as an adjunct to other textbooks, though.-"
1,Very Weak,The Java Podz coffee pads do not fit well in the Senseo coffee maker. One pad fits in the two cup holder. It makes a very weak cup of coffee. I ordered a large supply and will probably throw them out.
5,Review from singleservecoffee.com,"""This one caught us by surprise! We don't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it's really good! We love the way it smells - the way it tastes - and the fact it is just plain different. Most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent - and it's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee - meaning - a rich...flavored cup of coffee is hard to come by and this one is very good."" - singleservecoffee.com"
2,Not a fan,I just expected so much more from the people who are in this stand-up. Just disappointed. I thought some parts were funny. But not worth the money for a couple laughs and that much time wasted.
1,My Mistake,I failed to notice that I was purchasing a VHS and not a DVD. I returned it and my money was refunded with no problems.
3,"3 1/2 stars, actually","I really wanted to check this out because I love The Original Kings of Comedy,and I had heard routines from Earthquake and J.Anthony Brown that I liked.It was good,but The Kings Of Comedy is better.I was greatly dissapointed with J. Anthony Brown's performance.He did not tell any good jokes,all he did was cuss.D.L Hughley's performance was good,but I have heard better from this King Of Comedy.I am generally not a fan of black female comedians,but Sommore gives a very funny performance.Bruce Bruce gives a very funny performance also.I like the way he tells the audience that he leaves the stage,and then leaves.Rickey Smiley gives a decent performance.My favorite comedian on here is definitely Earthquake.I love is joke about Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown.(You know how hard it is to find someone to cook your crack cocaine the way you like it?)Overall,this is good,but the Kings of Comedy is better."
2,Disappointed,I was so disappointed with this comedy video. I think I actually laughed at two of the jokes Rickey Smiley told about funerals. The jokes Bruce Bruce told were actually shown on the comedy channel so I had already seen his material. What I remember most about this video is the cursing. It was tooo excessive. I would not recommend anyone purchase this video borrow it from a friend or rent it at the video store
5,Charlie's Best,This CD has almost all my favorite Charlie songs. Audio quality is excellent. Highly recommended
2,Best pump of the season? NOT!,"Wow. Where do I begin? Let's start with what is good about this shoe. It is beautifully made and well-constructed. But the positives end there.What's wrong with the shoe:1) TERRIBLE FIT. The fit it terrible -- I ususally wear 8.5M in dress heels, and the length was too short and toe box too tight. It was 1/2 to 1 size too small.2) LOOKS CHEAP. I ordered the red croc. The leather is thick, stiff & shiny. Quite frankly, it looked cheap, like something from Payless or Walmart.3) DOESN'T ENHANCE. Finally, the shoe does nothing for the foot. Because of the way it cuts across the top, it widens and shortens the foot. I prefer shoes that enlongate the foot.Simply put, this shoe is unattractive. It went back without hesitation."
4,Great little book,This was a nice little book to read in short spurts; I read it on my lunch hour over several weeks. The story is compelling and I hated to see it end!
4,A Beautiful Journey,"Abigail Thomas takes the reader on a wonderful and painful journey of love, sorrow and sharing. I felt I was with her every step of the way."
3,Not what I expected,"A heartfelt interesting story about how a life can change in an instant, and the aftermath of that instant. I liked the way she described her life and the way she coped with her husband's accident and subsequent mental health, still caring and not forsaking him just because things were different. I was expecting more of a ""dog"" story, but it ended up being a very personal chronicle of the people, not so much about the dogs. The 3 stars is for not being what I expected, altho I still liked the story."
4,Poignant memoir,"Coping her with husband's long-term brain injury, Abigail Thomas nevertheless writes a memoir that is full of acceptance, appreciation and even, a kind of hope. I recommend this book to anyone, but in particular to late-blooming writers (she began in her late 40s)."
5,Few Words Are Needed,"I noticed that most of these reviews of Abigail Thomas' ""A Three Dog Life"" are short but enthusiastic, and I think the reason is that the book sort of defies description. I'll try: It's good. It's VERY good."
3,not really dog related,"This is a beautifully written, well edited book about a woman whose life is shattered when her husband has an accident and receives a devastating head injury. The story basically depicts her rebuilding her life as woman who lives alone with dogs and visits her husband weekly in a nursing home, the dogs are an afterthought so the title is very misleading. The one problem I had with it, was the ending... it was like running into a wall... you're reading this well written book then it just stops... I kept trying to turn the page. It actually really HAD NO ENDING... no wrap up, it just stopped, and I felt kind of cheated!! and not in a good way.. I really think the author should have rethought the end.."
5,A Three Dog Life,I greatly admire this memoir of survival after the most unexpected in life occurs. I keep a copy handy and have shared A Three Dog Life with many friends. This book gave me the courage to write my own bookSurvival Snapshots: Defending Home Against Sex Addiction
3,Not as good as I wanted it to be,I liked the premise of the book however the author wrote all over the place. At times it was confusing to know if she was talking in the past or in the present. If you want a memoir I would suggest The Glass Castle instead.
5,lovely memoir,"I picked up this book at the library and enjoyed it so much that I bought a copy. This could be yet another melodramatic fluff about life tragedy but it was a joy! It is sad and pulling in many ways, she has lost so much, but she turns it around and sees life with a new twist. It opens our eyes to all that is true when it seems as though another day is dismal and trying. Abigail Thomas provides humor and tenacity through an extremely difficult time. The comfort of a dog can be the best comfort of all, no judgment and lots of love."
2,a three dog life,I was not interested in completing the book. It seemed to ransoms to me. It didnot hold my I interest
1,Boring read!,"The reviews which persuaded me to purchase this book were completely WRONG!! It was nothing as I had expected, regret the purchase :("
3,"It was just ""ok""","While I cared about the author and her story, it didn't go deep enough into anything. Not much about dogs, her husbands injury, etc. I enjoyed the part on ""coincidences"" (I don't want to spoil it for anyone) but I wish it would have gone into it more. In to everything more, really. I fell asleep reading this everytime I tried to read it.Stephen King's rave was misleading and I wonder if he's read, ""The Glass Castle"" -- that is by far the best memoir I have ever read."
3,It's not about dogs. The title is deceptive.,"I felt cheated because I thought there would be some material about dogs, because dogs are in the title, and it is sold as a pet book. But in fact the author has no insight into the life of her dogs. She does not explore anything about them and doesn't mention that she must have a bond with them. Many people learn through tragedy how comforting dogs can be, how life affirming and how to live in the present, but this author never mentions anything like that. It is really a memoir about living with a husband with a brain injury. It is a sweet memoir. But don't look here for anything interesting about dogs. Every time she had a sentence about dogs, I got excited thinking it was going to go somewhere, to a speculation or philosophy, but it never does. Dogs are really just objects to her."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. The author does not really get into much depth about any issues an individual that is brain-injured has. I expected it to give my family some guidance. It was a waste of my time.My mother received a permanent brain injury from an automobile accident 26 years ago. She has severe behavior problems and a long list of other difficulties. Our family is still struggling with her care. Although brain injury is more common than you think, it is close to impossible to find solid advice and compassion.Maybe my expectations were too high."
2,Annoying Tone,"Well, I bought the book because of a recommendation by the browsing icon on Amazon. Plus, after seeing that the book was ""the best memoir"" Steven King ever read, I had to give it a chance.I found the tone of the book to be really annoying, and it sounded like listening to some old lady rant about a myriad of inconsequential things that matter only to her alone, but yet somehow made it into the book I had paid for and was holding in my hands. The story begins with the story of her husband's accident which left him with permanent brain damage, which is somewhat intriguing and lamentable, but then she switches tone and begins to talk about her inner struggles about removing ""the black sock with red peppers from my left foot"" and all these other loony things that really no one cares about.But don't take my word for it. Read it yourself and you might actually find her ""voice"" endearing and friendly. I sure didn't."
1,crappy Look inside spoiler!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sadly, if you have done the Look inside preview of the book, you have learned something that was better left until the end of the book, as the author intended it to be. Amazon, please remove page 183 from your look inside feature!"
5,a comfort,"I have bought this book several times as a gift for those struggling with the problems of a terminally ill spouse, or for friends who have just lost a spouse who was ill for a long time. Thomas writes a memoir of the ten years while her husband lingered after a traumatic brain injury, her sense of lose, her delight in the small moments. You finish the book with a new and cherished friend, Abigail Thomas."
4,A three dog life is a good read,I just finished reading A Three Dog Life which I got for free from Amazon Prime. The title caught my eye because of my love for dogs. It was a well written memoir of the author's experience when her husband suffers a traumatic brain injury after he was hit by a car while walking his dog. I had a lump in my throat throughout the book. I believe her dogs help her cope with the turn of events her life has taken. I would recommend this book.
4,Three Dog Life,"Abigal Thomas writes a moving and humorous story of her life withdogs, the joy and comfort they bring, her husband, now deceased, and her adjustment to his accident, and later, his death.Entertaining and well-written, I devoured this Christmas gift in hours, and ordered her other books!"
4,"Sad, sweet and wonderful.","""A Three Dog Life"" by Abigail Thomas is a wonderful telling of one woman's struggle to deal with life after her husband's life altering accident. Thomas pulls us into her life and her mind as we venture through all the changes with her. The book is written so conversationally that the reader can't help but feel as if the author is a close friend and one we care strongly about. While there are struggles and sadness in the book, the tone doesn't become heavy or depressing. Thomas manages to keep it upbeat so that we're not bogged down by the events. As she learns to live again, we are right there with her and learn much about our own thoughts and feelings. What would we do if our lives were twisted in a way such as her's was? Would we come through it as strongly as she? These are questions that flicker through the mind and it gives one pause to wonder. This is an all around great book and a quick read. Definitely well worth the time."
5,Misleading title perhaps,"This is a beautifully written book, at turns touching, painful, and hilarious. I read this in book club and we agreed: the title is somewhat misleading. The dog-lovers in the group hoped for more about the dogs -- the author's daily interaction with them, their role in assuaging her grief, etc. Although this is a wonderful book, if you're hoping it will center around the dogs, it won't. They are very peripheral to the story. Lovely honest writing, though, and food for both heart and intellect."
5,A FIVE STAR BOOK,"This remarkable book is both poignant and upbeat - gives hope and pathos to the way life can work. Is a ""keeper"" that I loan to others but do not let go of - will read again and again."
2,disappointed,"This book left me cold. It was not primarily about the dogs--not much was done about them at all other than cashing in on a catchy title. In particular, I was bothered by the many mistakes of grammar and usage made by someone who is a teacher of writing."
3,A e Dog Life,"Haven't read this yet, but I am expecting it to be very good based on what family and friends have said about it. I am disappointed that it does not appear to be bound well. The pages are either not uniform size or not stacked and bound together correctly. Many of the pages stick outside the paperback cover, giving the impression that they are loose."
4,Bride cake topper,"Overall I'm happy with it. The hair was darker than it looked in the picture, so I used a yellow marker to lighten it a little."
1,microphone,"I ordered a white michrophone but I received a silver color. Currently I am in Turkey,. How can I change this product?Prof. Ihsan Sabuncuoglu"
4,"Great watch, Poor wristband","This watch is great, I love it, but the wristband is hard to adjust (I haven't managed yet) and the watch itself is a bit heavy."
5,"Awsome,","Well watch by far one of the best I have owned, the links are really easy to remove, it looks extreamy sharp. The only problem I have with it is it ctaches my wrist hair, was a little painful the first day I had it on, now its awsome.I recommend this watch to any CASIO fanP.S. - Its maid in Japan!"
3,Downsides of the watch,"The downside of this watch is that analog side is sometimes blocking digital side of the watch. Also my friends considering this watch too heavy, but for me it is ok. Bigest downside is that thermometer that is completely useless. The situation is like this: I am outside. Its ice all around me. But the watch shows me + 15 degreess after celcius. The instruction tells that hand can give wrong reading because of the hand. Its best adviced to take it off and leave it for 30 min. I did it and then the error was about 1.5 degrees after celcius. I could live with that or i could calibrate that ,but it looks like everytime i need a temperature measurement i need to leave it somewhere for 30 minutes..."
2,Stupid design/purchase,"Thermometer doesn't work on your wrist. It must be off your wrist for 20-30 minutes to get a good reading. You can't see the reading if it's about 9 o'clock or any hour:45.Other digits are easily obscured by the hands.THE BAND IS A NON-STANDARD TYPE (NO PINS) SO NOT EASY TO ADJUST. THE LINKS ARE TOO BIG AND PINCH HAIR. FINE LENGTH ADJUSTMENT IS LIMITED TO TWO HOLES ON THE CLASP, which doesn't cover the range of lengths you might want.Several design elements are totally frivolous. One has LCDs marking the seconds around the perimeter (good idea!) for the last 30 seconds of each minute, but not the first 30 secs (stoopid). Another shows how far along you are in the current 10 minute slice. As if.Like with pretty much all watches these days, you can't count on the alarm to wake you up.Gets maybe an extra star for being good looking."
2,"Nice watch, thermometer useless",Very nice looking watch2 problemsThe thermometer is highly inaccurate when you wear the watch it shows a temp higher by at least 5 degrees (from your body temp)The illumination goes off in less than a second making it hard to read the time before it goes offA nice feature is the automatic light that you can set to come on when you look at the time like when you raise your wrist
2,its ok,"The watch looks good in pictures. But the face is difficult to see. There is to much going on on the face. Programming is a pain in the a--. The bracelet is stiff and not very comfortable. Although I bought this watch as a beater, its going up for sale."
4,Nice watch...inaccurate thermo!!!,"This wacth is really nice. It is fantastic for the needs I have. I am sorry about the thermometer because it shows a higher temperature than the real is. But, it does not matter for me. I truly recommend it!!"
1,PLEASE BE CAREFUL WITH CASIO WATCHES!!,"I have had a Casio watch for about a year and now the watchband needs replaced. I was informed by Walmart that they cannot replace a Casio watchband. I called Casio and they told me that as far as they know NO CASIO WATCHBAND CAN BE REPLACED BY A NORMAL WATCHBAND! I had to order a watchband from Casio and they had to know which model it was before I ordered it. Total price: $12.00 shipping, handling and sales tax included. I then asked the representative if instructions would be included because it was a different type of setup instead of pins. HE SAID THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO RECOMMEND TAKING THE BAND TO A JEWELER TO HAVE IT PUT ON!! PLEASE BEWARE OF THIS AS BANDS DO NOT LAST FOREVER!!"
4,"I ordered a new watch, But the one I recieved seems to be a used and old one.","I ordered the watch and I got it in 8 days.I was expecting the watch to be a Brand new watch. When I got the watch I was too excited . The packing was all new and original. But when I unwrapped the watch it was the same model, But it was Old and used one.I dont know how did it happen and I did not found it anywhere mentioned on the site that It would be a old watch.I want amazon to Replace the watch with a new one."
1,Piece of junk.,My wife bought this watch for me from Amazon 7 months ago. When I tried to switch from daylight savings time the center button was stuck making it impossible to change. Warranty is useless.
1,Hard To Read Dial,"This is a handsome watch, but it is very hard to read the LCD displays. The instructions are necessary as there is nothing intuitive about setting the time and accessing all of its functions. The instructions that came with the watch are only readable with a magnifying glass (for those over the age of 39), as they are written in micro type. The watch band pulls hair out of my wrist, so I don't wear it. Overall I'd say this is a stylish watch, but it is a real dog as far as ergonomics are concerned."
1,"Nice looking, but a poor fit and watch band","I bought this watch for casual wear to avoid damaging my more expensive watches. The watch works fine and looks OK, but I must say it has the worst band I have ever encountered. When sizing it, the individual links are very large which makes it tough to get an exact fit. As luck would have it, removing 3 links leaves the watch too loose and 4 links is a bit too tight. Another problem is the band catches on the hair on your wrist. Be prepared for a bald wrist and painful experience if you wear this watch everyday! I think in this price range, a rubber band will probably work better."
2,Undeniable Facts (Unbiased I hope),First and foremost--Digits cannot be seen in low light. I'm not talking about what most people think of as low light. I mean anything less than daylight. I have not been able to read the watch in conditions I could easily read a book.The hands cover the digits! More trouble than you might think.Hour hand is hard to see because it is red and has a hole in i--there is not enough contrast with the black face.Area of face is too small--about 3/4 inch across--There is room for a one and an eighth inch face.Thermometer is very accurate! But only if you take it off for a half hour to let it reach room temp.What does Edifice mean (as far as this watch goes)?
3,Great look/bad band,I bought this watch based on the reviews. I just recieved it today and realized that this is a truly great looking watch. The down side and the reason why I am sending it back is because of the crappy band. The band feels and sounds cheap. In my opinion a metal watch band shouldn't squeak. This watch would have been a keeper if it weren't for the band.
5,Nice watch with good price,"This Casio watch is very nice for its price. Comparing with this price watch, I rate it as 5 stars."
3,"OK price, nice features, hard to read & operate","Hard to read the digital info, even with the light on. When the analog hands (minute/ hour) are in the way, the info is covered and unusuable. Hourly & alarm beep aren't very loud compared to other Casio's I've owned. Didn't buy it for the temperature option but it's accurate. Haven't really played with it enough to use and re-set all the functions as needed, but they're not as easy to access as other watches. Maybe because there's so many features. All-in-all a nice looking, well-built watch with good features at a decent price but I wouldn't buy another if it got lost, stolen or broken."
3,A good watch but lacking in QC,"It look good for its price and functions as specified. However, mine has condensation behind the mineral glass! Fogs up the whole glass. Bad luck or QC problem?"
4,Excellent watch,Very happy with this purchase. So far everything working perfectlyJust 1 small thing - it pulls my hair on my wrist. My previous watches didnt and they were also metal.Otherwise tho im still really happy with the watch. Very good looking and solid watch :)
3,its ok,the watch doesnt came with the manual. i had to download from the casio's web site. but the watch works fine
3,"Looks great, but has issues.","I love the look of this watch. It looks far more expansive than I paid for it. It has many great fetures for its price. Unless you have special tool or take it to a jewler, getting it sized is not an easy task and casued me to scratch the band. The instruction manual is pretty large but easy to follow. As you would expext from a watch of this style the digital displays get covered by the hands at certain times. I'm used to light watches and this has some heft to it. The biggest problem is the band. I either have to have it slightly too big or slightly to small for my wrist. Also if you have any hair on your wrist it will rip them out."
2,"Nice Watch, Lousy Thermometer","If you're looking for a thermometer watch, I suggest you look elsewhere. Thw watch is heavy and seems well constructed but the thermometer feature lacks. I tried to calibrate this thing as described in the user guide, and while I was wearing it (as suggested by other reviewers) but it simply will not give an accurate temperature reading. But for $50.00, you get what you pay for."
5,A lot of bang for the buck,This watch looks great and feels well made. I find the level of night lighting to be very sufficient. The metal parts of the watch do seem to show scratches.
2,eats arm hair!,"Loved the watch, but had to send it back. This thing pulls arm hair like crazy! Yowch! Now, if you dont hair, its a pretty awesome value. Looks elegant, yet still has those neat techy features"
5,Classic but advanced Watch..,"Well i am happy to buy this watch, as the price and the features are the perfect match for this range of watch.Only one thing which gives me trouble is the black dial as it doesn't shows the time in dark night. It could be better if they could have used radium colours on hands and numbers to see it in the dark as well, which most of other brands are doing these days.Otherwise it is a good deal!!Amazon.com has build a trust to me as they have provided me a very prompt service, in short much appreciated.Cheers!!"
2,Can't see the time,"It looks good on the website but after I got it, I was unable to see the time clearly (with 20/20 vision). The digital time font is too small and dull & the analog hands are not visible coz of those small white circles on the face of the watch."
1,"Good Watch, Bad Strap","Good Watch, but the strap is so badly designed that you just cannot wear it. Inspite of not having too much of hair on my arm, this watch is a pain to wear. And you cannot change the strap to leather one. This supports only the default metal ones and they are very badly designed."
1,Would not buy again,"As with others was looking forward to receiving watch. When i opened it the main part of the watch is to small, thought it would be bigger from other reviews read. Band is so flimsy and so small. Would have brought another one if i had my chance again."
4,nice watch,"I like this watch, but the band is hard to adjust. If I take one link out it is a little tight and uncomfortable. If I put that link back in it is too loose and slides around my wrist. The thermometer is a nice feature once you get it calibrated to adapt to your body temperature. Overall, the watch looks nice when worn with dress clothes. The subtlty of the digital functions of the watch make it more classical in appearance."
3,YoungLad,"The watch looks nice and unlike some I got an accurate temp reading. The digital information is too little and the light is too late. The size of the info is small and not clear for old eyes. The lighted version of the display is only on for a very short time making viewing difficult. Some (with young vision) should love this watch, however be cautious if you have difficulty reading small displays."
4,I'd rather give it a positive evaluation.,I received it before the time they declare on line. This watch is in a good quality and delivery is on time. Accurate and fashion. Temperature is not accurate but it is adjustable. The time for background light is too short.
1,Not a watch if you like your arm hairs,I would comment on the design of the watch but it is all pretty irrelevant to me. This watch consistently ripped all of the hairs out of my arm for the two painful days I wore it. Don't buy this watch if you value the hairs on your arm and have a low pain threshold.Buy this one instead:Fossil Men's Chronograph Bracelet Watch
3,band needs to be adjustable,I like the watch but could not wear it the band was way to big. could not make it smaller
2,Too hard to program...returned it,"wud hv 2 carry instruction booklet around....far too complicated to setup and adjust for daily use....thermometer was gud and returning was very easy.... casio has gud name, but similar to learning windows 7 after using vista on computer....."
4,amzing...!,"today i received my watch, and i liked it !its really nice..definitely you can get this product for sure..!"
3,A little disapointed...,"The watch looks really cool and is built well. Unfortunately its design is not all that practical. The analog hands cover the digital portions so for for part of the hour you can't read the seconds, then when that comes into view, you lose the date, temperature, etc. There is a nifty digital circle that counts the seconds but it only goes halfway around the bezel so as long as you only want to see half of the minute I guess you are fine. The whole face lights up at night so if the digital time isn't blocked by the hands, it is pretty easy to read. Otherwise you look for the dark shadows which is all you can see of the hands. The tips of the hands are meant to glow, but uness you charge them in front of a flood light, don't expect to see anything. I will wear this watch until it wears out but there isn't really anything that endears me to it. Less practical than your average $10 variety."
2,Photo was good,"2 problems. 1st, the digital display is very dim. Almost useless. 2nd, temp meter is not accurate. Cannot trust. I returned my order to Amazon.com."
2,Band fell off,"I like the features & appearance of this watch. I was even able to remove 3 band links for adjustment myself (after watching a YouTube video on how to do it). However, after wearing it for a few days, under no extreme conditions, I was in my home & casually lowered my arm & the watch suddenly fell off my arm. It came apart where the band attaches to the watch itself. The spring loaded pin was not bent & there was no apparent damage. I was able to put it back together using the pin & it seemed secure. The wore it that day & into the next day. I had tugged on the band a little bit on both sides of the watch & it seemed secure. Well, later that day I again happened to casually lower my arm & it came apart again & fell off my arm.Up until the watch fell off I never touched the location where the band attached to the watch. The only place to remove the band links are at the the other ends of the band next to the clasp, and they're marked by arrows. I returned the watch."
2,Poorly made,"2 screws on the back of this watch came loose and the watch was ruined as my son took a shower. My son did not tinker with it at all, the screws just came loose on the back panel with normal wear and my son did not realize this. It appears to be poorly made although it does do a lot of cool things. Buyer beware."
4,Perfect for the money,"I purchased this watch two months ago now and I still couldn't be happier about it. This watch does everything you need it to do, while still looking nice and small. I definately recommend this watch to anyone looking for a casual/functional timepiece for all occations."
2,Edifice watch,"Watch is just OK. Readout is sometimes obscured. Temp readings are way off if worn, only roughly accurate when not worn. Many times during the day the digital readout, date and temp are obscured."
4,Jonah's epic is finally complete,"Just as he enters ""Phase Two"" with Molly, Jonah begins to think about Sophie again. The journal contains several of Jonah's fantasies seen in the first volume. Jonah receives mails from Sophie, yet does not try to contact her until he travels north with sister Honey. The fun doesn't really start until the two begin their road trip to visit their father and his wife, whom Honey intimidates throughout the visit. Jonah makes a surprising move with Sophie that impresses Northgirl, who finally reveals herself. This book puts an end to all the questions: who is Northgirl; will Honey really go to Harvard; will Jonah ever get over Sophie; why is Sophie so crazy; what ever happened to Sullivan; and will Jonah ever get laid? Although this is an excellent finale to the series, a few questions remain unanswered."
2,Reads like an infomercial,"This book did not live up to the expectations of other reviewers. I guess everyone is different. To me, it was a lot of hype. They kept saying they weren't going to tell you how you should do it (ie. evolve, grow, find your truth, etc), yet kept telling you how to do it. I thought some of the channeled stuff was right on, but did not get much out of the parts written by the authors."
2,strange acid trip,"Not what I was looking for. Was hoping for concise details of the upcoming cosmic change, but found spirit channeling and dreams of Atlantis. Beyond my imagination, I'm still grounded in reality."
3,Sweet but predictable,This movie was too hollywood for me and we knew exactly how it would end so I gave it to a friend of mine and said he could keep it.
4,Goal-The Dream Begins,"A fairy story that comes true in today's cynical world, great acting, great cast, great location/environment scenes, rags to riches/success story, the old world and the new clashes and in doing so changes for the better the lives of all in the story, can't wait for part 2 !"
1,Cliche sports movie that is the definetion of torture,"Well I was watching this movie while I was taking therapy, and instead of getting better I felt like I was getting tortured . The plot is just so un original, and the acting is just crap . The movie was increadibly boring, and you knew what was going to happen . On the positive side it looks good, but thats about it ."
2,I am an idiot,"I live in Australia and this doesn't work on my playstation 3, should have read the description more carefully. But seriously why can't blu ray be more like hd dvd and be region free it is just stupid, how can you call yourself a next generation medium when it still has the same annoying problems as it's previous medium. As well as hd dvd looks way sharper, in closing blu ray sucks balls! Love this movie though"
5,Goal,Bought this as a gift for my husband. We love the movie! The video came on time and was in excellant condition.
5,Awesome!!!,ONE OF THE BEST SOCCER MOVIES EVER. ITS SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE. ITS A MUST HAVE IF UR A SOCCER FAN. ENJOY IT!.
3,"Drags a bit,but overall pretty good","I think the message in the film is good.However it drags a bit.I believe it is a good film for older atletes,perhaps high school age and above.The actor playing Danny gave a great performance!"
5,16 instrumental tracks for you,"This CD has 12 Reggaeton & 4 Hip Hop songs that just have the melody/beat. The rest is up to you: You can mix in your own lyrics if you can rap, or dance/workout to the beat without having to deal with repitive or foul lyrics. I personally don't like the ""hip hop"" tracks cause they sound cheesy, but I like the Reggaeton tracks and each had enough variety to sound different from the other."
5,surfer bibs,I love these bibs! They're great for small babies as well as toddlers because they are long and you don't have to worry about them getting too short for your child. I bought one for my newborn son and my 2 year old daughter. We love Hawaiian theme type things so these were great!
3,Wasn't please with the quality,I tough the quality of the picture was gonna be better ! I would recommend to buy somewhere else if you want a great quality for a poster
4,This one is beautiful,I got this toe ring and just love wearing it. Its pretty sturdy but is slightly different from the image shown. in the middle portion its more of silver but image shows a white tinge.The only problem is that they are too narrow that they fit only super thin toes though they are adjustable.
4,Works well,"I bought the Goodwinol because my dog has Demodex Mange. My Vet told me to use this until the hair loss is gone. The product worked great and fast. The only downfall is you need to keep your dog off the furniture because it will stain. I keep covers on my furniture because of hair, so I just took it off and washed the cover. It was well worth the effort. I believe it is well worth the price."
3,Goodwinol,"Not sure how effective this product is, because my dog had a generalized case of demodex, but now only has small local areas and the product was not as effective as other products."
1,DIdn't work,"This ointment did nothing to help even clear up the slightest skin rash, help to soften up dry skin or anything that the description said it would. Very disappointed."
4,my dog loves this,"I had a problem with my dog developing bare spots after being boarded at a kennel. After doing some research I decided to try goodwinol ointment. This stuff works great and her skin is looking healthier and hair is growing back. I only give it 4 stars due to pricing, the jar is a tiny one once jar. It is still cheaper than a vet bill though and it works."
5,Wonderful Standards Album,"This is a cd full of great standards.The songs are exellent. No one sings with more emotion than Michael Bolton. I don't care what critics say and I don't think music fans do either. We know what we like. Michael's version of ""Summertime"" alone is worth the price of the cd. His is my all time favorite version of this song. His version of this song is also my favorite Michael Bolton recording ever. The other songs are great but I play ""Summertime"" repeatedly."
2,Sallymademebuyit!,"We are big and I mean big Michael Bolton fans, when my wife heard about this CD, she made me go on Amazon.com and buy it immediately. After all, we really loved Rod Stewart's CD and thought Michael would kick ass with this one. W-w-w-r-r-r-o-o-n-n-g! His intrepretations were soulless and his voice seem strained. I never thought any of the quality singers could ruin At Last, but our Michael did. And what's with the 36 minutes of music?"
1,Oh boy,"This man has got to be stopped. It's an absolute abomination what he's done and continues to do to the soul classics of this country. The banality that pervades this man's ""talent"" is beyond words! And the hair isn't helping things either."
1,stick to new,"Am no fan of MB, so naturally am biased.There is no comparison to these numbers performed by the likes of Sinatra, Nat Cole, etal. Regret to say the voice quality is nowhere, sounds like a problem with constipation."
4,"Short, but sweet","Like the earlier reviewer, my main lament is that this could have been twice as long. What is here is very fetching. ""All The Way""(a great song) is just tailor-made for Bolton's expressive, emotional, over-the-top romantic style. I prefer this to the Timeless CD. Perhaps an advantage is that the songs go together more than the thrown-together bunch on that CD. A great singer and great songs."
2,Okay...,"This was an okay album. Michael doesn't seem to put any emotion into the songs, almost like he was forced to do the record. I definitely wasn't feelin' it. As much as it hurts to say it, I can only squeeze 2 stars out of this one."
1,putrid! good for a few laughs.,"Vintage, by the one and fortunately only Michael Bolton, is a product of supreme arrogance. Now Prince Putrid thinks he can interpret the classics.It is painfully apparent here that the ""artist"" has virtually no talent for this music. Bolton renders the tunes into incomprehensible schlock, and it is quite pathetic and not alltogether unamusing that so many women (and their hopelessly entrapped men as well) continue to go for his mindless bellowing. They say that he ""sings from the heart"". Actually, Bolton sings from another anatomical form not to be mentioned at this time.The cd is good for a few yucks I suppose, but that is all. If you don't listen to this with a mindset to laugh, then break out the Mylanta or Imodium (or both)! I would give this negative infinity stars, if possible. Thank you."
5,Forza Azzuri !!,Nek's music definitely exudes a powerful vibe. His music is very infectious. My girlfriend who does not speak Italian is now singing Nek tunes around our apartment. How great is that ? The best way to describe Nek to anyone unfamiliar with his music is think Sting to Ricky Martin. This comparison best describes Nek's far ranging talents. To many great tracks on this CD to single out any. All I can say is enjoy! Forza la musica italiana!!
5,Perfetto!!!,"Nek's latest CD La vite e` is a wonderful change full of many new sounds. I was very happy to see that although his style is evolving and growing with even more originality, there is still enough of his original style that his fans have grown to love. My favorite song is probably ""Sul Treno"" but all of the songs are catchy, original, and almost entoxicating. I noticed that the translation of the texts of the songs to spanish were pretty much true to the original meaning of the italian songs...that's always a plus. Don't forget to add this to your CD collection."
3,"Good so far, giving as a gift","I am giving this as a Christmas gift, so I haven't been able to watch it. But I was happy with the delivery."
3,"Close, no cigar","I LIKE Hot Chip's remixes, but this debut album is, truth be told, a bit of a letdown after the slow trickle of singles and 12""s that have been flowing that past few years - all build-up, no climax - nice production sheen and some cool electro noodles, but they're still in search of...er...um...actual SONGS you can wrap your head and ears around. Still the JUSTUS KOHNCKE remix of OVER AND OVER on import is a nice stuff, in a ""White Horse"" by Laidback sorta way."
5,Outstanding quality at an awesome price.,"Just purchased the Epson C40UX printer to replace a Lexmark that stopped working. I was on a budget and after doing some research decided to try the C40UX at only [price]! What a pleasant surprise! This machine prints flawlessly! Pros: nice size (not too big a machine); beautiful quality text and graphics; excellent low price! Cons: Very noisy; Black inktank is too small (will probably require many replacements if you do alot of printing); also, color cartridge is combined (separate ink tanks are more economical in my opinion)."
1,Epson should hang their heads in shame!,"I just threw this piece of junk against a brick wall and feel better already. Print jobs are slow, the print quality is average at best, but worse, the ink ""manager"" is a mere tool by Epson to tie you to their tiny, overpriced cartridges to say nothing of the time you waste trying to get it to work. Trying to work with this Epson C40UX printer is the worst experience I have ever had with any product I have ever purchased. Epson should hang their heads in shame."
2,loud and slow,"I got this printer free when I bought my new desktop for school. It prints very slowly, is very loud, and of poor quality. I have stopped using it to print papers because they looked very unprofessional and I did not like the look. It is a cheap printer, and I would only recommend it if you can not afford anything else (or it was free)."
1,Short life span,"I bought this printer for Xmas 2001. Within four months it didn't want to let the ink through. I parked it for three months while I used my old printer, then tried it again and it worked fine. Today, (February 2003) I printed out a page and after it finished printing, a message came up telling me that parts in my printer need replacing and it now refuses to work. There was no indication of any problems. Only two months after the warranty is up and it is toast. For all the use I got out of it, it was not worth the money, and also not worth the money to send it away to have it fixed. Completely disposable!! and it didn't get all that much use."
1,"Junk printer, do not buy it","I bought one from Dell but this printer runs out ink so quickly. I have printed less than 10 black-white pages for the first box of ink. I bought another one and it ran out before I printed 5 pages!!!And for the color part, I ONLY printed 2 pages and today I found all ink is gone!!Do not buy it, unless you want to pay for the ink every 10 pages!!!"
1,one step below junk,"I should not complain about this printer, since I got a rebate thatwas equal to the amount I paid for it when I bought an IMAC.Essentially it was FREE.The trouble is I cannot understand WHY a manufacturer wouldmake such a piece of junk, other than to TEST whether or not many consumers will buy a bad product through a REBATE deal.The printer was incredibly slow in printing a page. It made a noiselouder than my small honda generator. (It actually made me laugh every time it printed a page). It DID make quality prints, which surprised me.It had horrendous software, which made troubleshooting printing prob-lems almost impossible. It was VERY difficult to get to the ink cartridgessince they had to mechanically move into the correct position tochange them. Finally after 9 months it died. The drive belt would not stay attached to the print head.Please PLEASE I beg you, don't even get this printer free. It will eatup all your time trying to get it to work."
1,So SLOW,"This is the a horrible printer. I've had Canon and HP printers in the past and this one is the worst. The paper doesn't load right and it is ridiculously slow After less than a year, the cartridge sticks and I cannot get it to print straight."
4,Over 1 year old and still working great,"I got this printer last year with a PC bundle and wasn't expecting a whole lot. After one year of use and of printing something almost daily I have to say I am pleasantly surprised.If you team up with a good scanner, your photos come out real nice. Not quite photo quality but good enough to frame. Of course, you have to use the right paper to achieve the best result. Speed is sufficient even at the higher end although it could be quicker.I havent had any paper feed problems or ink issues since I've started using it. Basically if you get this as part of a PC bundle I think it will suffice for the day to day use."
2,epson stylus c40ux,I fing that it is slow and it needs repairing quicker than other printers. It also lacks the printing quality.
1,Ink Scheme makes Epson ...,"I bought it, it worked great. 50 prints later, Black ink is nearly empty. No prob, I think, I'll just change this text color to red and use up the color ink. This worked for a while, then I got the ""BLACK INK IS EMPTY"" error, and theprinter efused to print without a new black ink cartridge."
5,Very good stuff.,My 2 year old loves this series. Good quality. Not so easy for little ones to damage it. Nice color and print.
2,Money Better Spent Elsewhere,"The premise of this series sounds great... but it fails to deliver. It's a collection of short stories focusing on the milestones of learning to fly the F-15. Unfortunately there is no depth to these 'stories' and all you see is irrelevant personal footage and lots of background commentary on what you've just seen. This combined with the over the top editing using short clips, lots of graphics and flash makes me think the director just didn't know about the process, and didn't have enough footage.Spend your money of Imax's ""Fighter Pilot"" for spectacular cinematography and great footage of aircraft or the PBS Documentary ""Carrier"" for a combination of the aircraft, ships, life at sea and stories of the sailors/aviators."
2,Great idea - but badly executed!,"I bought this dvd series through Amazon a while ago now, and although I don't regret buying it, it really is quite a painful series to watch because of what has been done during the post-production process.The editing is truly shocking, with far too much stop/start, slow motion/fast forward bits added in for 'effect' - which in my honest opinion adds nothing of any value to the production. The aircraft and people are interesting enough, but the editors have ruined this series by trying to be far too clever for their own good.Borrow a copy from a friend or rent it at the local dvd store, and spend the money you've saved on buying a few beers to settle your nerves while watching this series."
4,american top guns,Great documentary if you like fighter jets and what it takes to get there then this series is well worth it
1,don't bother with this one,"american fighter pilot , I might have watched it on free to air tv but don't bother buying it's a disapointment , I guess I hoped for more or some , actual inside plane footage , not just a Big Brother show that happened to include pilots ,"
5,Satisfied F-15 enthusiast,"The aerial footage in this series is awesome! The depiction of the training is accurate, according to my brother who has been through it. The plotline is slightly overdramatized and drawn out, but I'd give it a 4-star (out of 5) rating overall in the genre of documentaries. It's by far better than any of the reality series out there."
1,This DVD doesn't work and Amazon won't take it back,"I bought this DVD along with one other. It has three discs and only after I tried a second DVD player did I discover that it skipped entire chapters. When I tried it on a new RCA portable DVD player, it would not work at all, just skipped around. It's trash and Amazon won't take it back because the original plastic wrap has been removed (which it has to be if you want to see it). What a stupid policy. And there's no way to contact anyone on their website. I'll buy all my DVDs from a store from now on."
1,The editing is what caused this series to get canceled not the content,"This is by far the worst editing I have seen. You will enjoy if you suffer from schizophrenia or Attention Deficit Disorder, since no single video clip lasts for more than 1 second. Had this series been produced as a traditional documentary it would have been fascinating, but so much for that idea. I sat through three episodes before I could no longer stand it and turned it off. Thank God it was a rental. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD 1) you will regret it and 2) you will always hear me saying ""I told you so!"""
2,Could have been great if better edited ...,"This is one of the worst edited documentary I have ever seen.You can not have a single shot spoiled with flashes, slow motion, and unnecessary digital FX.I have nothing against crazy editing when it is for a 3 min MTV music clip or a TV add. But on a 7 hours documentary you get airsick.If fine edited, all this interresting story could have been told in less than two hours.Each episode has a more than 2 min introduction...During the episodes you see some shots more than ten times.By the way, I am a very long time aviation enthousiast."
5,An insightful look into the fighter pilot world...,"A unique look into the lives and development of 3 elite F-15 fighter pilots. Highly recommended for wannabe fighter pilots who need motivation, insight, and examples that it CAN BE DONE!"
3,Fun but overproduced,"I enjoyed this, I used to work on the F-15 and have been to Tyndall AFB. I watched this series when it came out on TV and was interested, and then heart broke when they canceled it! Fast forward a few years and I finally broke down to buy it. It was entertaining, but overproduced in my opinion. Too many overdubs and voice echos, it got old after the first ten minutes. I might watch it again, but it will be a few years. I am glad I did buy it so I could finish the series though."
5,Awesome,"As promised, waterproof. I'd buy this again. It took a beating over the course of a season of kayaking. No tears. It floats."
2,Dry Bag,"It dose not meet the requirment sory to say that.Iwant you please to review my order some of the Items I didnot recive it untill today floater eyewear yellow and adjustable Eyewear Retainer,Royal please advise."
3,Flubbed the dvd,"I remember seeing this many years ago and thinking this is decent sci-fi. The female menace is sort of hot looking and there is a genuine feeling of peril as she attacks. How did gregory Hines get this role? He did okay but he seemed an oddball choice for the lead role. Another one of those strange dvd disasters regarding the transfer. Its in fullscreen!(pan and scan) Where the heck is the widescreen? Someone doesnt care about the proper presentation of films. Nice sci-fi for a rainy Saturday afternoon, but wait for a widescreen transfer."
3,Eve of Destruction video,A good low budget sci fi movie. It doesn't take massive millions to make a good film.This is one of those that comes at you surprisingly. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.There aren't too many films that I watch more than once. This is one.Kudos to the seller for having it.
5,EXCELLENT FLICK,Great movie. Very underrated. The scene with the policemen in their yellow rain slickers gives me a big woodie!
5,Not the novel but an entertaining drama,Great to see the stars of the late fifties early sixties in an entertaining melodrama.Lana Turner and George Hamilton are particularly good.
2,Where was the original book?,I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It strayed so far from the book. This movie insulted the author. What was the screenwriter thinking?
5,Most complete Peel Sessions package,"This is the most complete package I've seen for any band that had sessions with John Peel. Grab it while there are still copies available, even if you have all of the other TWP Peel Session CDs. The live stuff is a fantastic way to round out the 6-CD set."
4,Looking Forward to More,"Fresh and off-beat, The Eighth Method has much to recommend it: interesting characters and an engaging plot with unexpected but believable twists. The clues are subtle but play fair with the reader and make for a story that is paradoxically both fey and logical. It savors of Christie and Stout without being a mere stylistic rehash and does what any good read should - leaves one eager for more. The good doctor and his slightly eccentric circle are grand company in the old tradition!"
2,Not what I thought it would be,It offers too many conflicting opinions and never proves or stands on many of them. It's not interesting reading. Would not buy again.
5,Could not find this within 60 miles,"I have a KerryBlue Terrier who won her Championship several years ago. We have always been conscious of a nutritional healthy diet. All at once we were not able to buy the products locally. I have always been able to find ""anything"" on Amazon and once again we were successful. We knew this was a great product,we just could not buy it without Amazon's help."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"The Logitech offers some unique qualities for a Blue Tooth. Easy to install and the carry case is a plus. What we don't see in these reviews are the sound quality on the other end of the phone conversation. The Mobile Pro produces a low voice along with a ""ting"" in the conversation. This is enough to return the product to Amazon, to see if there is another product that can produce a better sound on the other end!"
3,"Good headset, but has flaws",This headset is not bad but has some flaws:After a while (medium use) it started being sticky in the ear and it ruined my experience to the point I had to buy a different headset...
2,Disappointed,"purchased this product and after a period of time the headset somehow went on perminant mute. logitech was decent, sent me a new one, after the customer support guy had me make up number as to when i'd orginally bought the product. finally recieved my 2nd headset, and after a couple of months, talk time is down to 10 min before i get the low battery beeps. called logitech again and they told me to send in my original paperwork. after speaking to the same customer support guy, he wouldn't budge and i was under the impression logitech thought i was trying to scam them. so instead of messing with an inferior product, i order a Sony Ericsson HBH-300 Akono Headset. i'll keep my fingers crossed. stay away from this headset, it's really not worth the trouble."
2,Long-term reliability an issue,"I purchased two of these headsets about one year ago. Mine has since stopped working altogether, but my wife's continues to operate without issue -- and she uses her's much more than I do. Curious.Anyway, it is a nice headset with absolutely the best charger/case design that I have ever seen, but if you are looking for long-term use, you might want to look elsewhere. Of course, most people don't keep their phones too long these days and they cost much more than this little headset."
2,It is huge,"The shirt is ok, the material and color are ok, but the problem is that it is HUGE! I wear XL all the time, but this one has the XL tag but is like a XXL or maybe XXXL, it is huge, I just can't wear this thing."
5,Always an egnigmatic and tragic figure...,"Jeanne D'Arc, or as we know her, Joan of Arc, is undeniably one of the most intriguing female figures in history.I enjoyed and appreciated the historical accuracy and the in-depth accounts of her victorious battles as well as the accounts of her trials, betrayals by the very people she felt compelled by her God to support and defend and the eventual tragic outcome of what can only be termed a ""kangaroo court"". If you are into history and especially strong female figures, this is a must read. Above all, her life and her determination to what she perceived as her mission and purpose for being and her unbelievable faith, are deeply inspiring."
4,Giving Up Something You Can't Give Up,"Kleinian analyst Vivienne Lewin explores how being a twin affects a life, and how to disentangle oneself from something that one can't really disentangle oneself from, since one's very subjectivity was formed by it. Weak introductory and closing captures don't mar the effectiveness -- despite the usual limitations of dogmatic analytic writing that does not try to communicate to a wider audience -- of an empathic and difficult look at twins. Lewin exemplifies the best of the Kleinian tradition in that she is able to bear unthinkable anxieties while representing the deepest layers of the inner lives of twins."
4,Act Right Now & You Can Buy 5 Copies Of This CD For 5 Cents,"That's a great deal if you have a couple of cracked cases in your CD collection. Even after shipping and handling you got five cases. The CD itself is the eighth worst Rod Stewart album of all time, so you could be doing the world a favor by taking it out of circulation. It's a win/win the way I see it.Also, Charlie Parker does not love Rod Stewart. He was more of a Steve Marriott guy."
1,Sell Out,I gave this a few listens hoping it would improve. It did not improve.This is probably the worst Rod has ever done.This is not even close to a Rod Stewart sound. Dont waste your money!
5,HIS BEST WORK,"I have been a Rod Stewart fan for thirty years and have liked most of his stuff. I have to say that I think that this is his finest work yet.""BAR NONE"" He is like a fine wine getting better and better with age."
2,A Little Disappointed,"I love Rod Stewart, but I am a little disappointed with Human. Rod has long been a master of the rock ballad, but this new title is way to ballad heavy. Rod has successfully been able to blend up tempo rockers with ballads to create well balanced fun records. This new disc doesn't even have a song that approaches mid tempo until the last song I Can't Deny It (The best song on Human) Rod still does shows he can deliver rock ballads and whereas the songs are not bad, there are just too many slow songs. His last outing, When We Were The Young Boys, which by the way was highly underrated, is far superior to Human. So, overall not a horrible album but please don't head to the retirement home yet Rod, I know you still have some kick left. Just show it next time."
5,Absolutely the Best,I am an avid Rod Stewart Fan. I have most all of his recordings. I think this is the best by far. The songs are relaxing and inspiring.I think it is incredible!!
3,Not One Of His Best,"I was quite disappointed with this album. It sounds more like Rod was trying out for Pop Idol, American Idol, or the X- Factor. This album sounds so much like the stuff we hear on the radio that they call music. It sounds so manufactured and similar to what they call R&B today, you know that boy band type of stuff. There are only 3 good songs out of 11 on this CD. To Be With You, Run Back Into Your Arms, and I Can't Deny It are the typical Rod Stewart songs and just what we would expect to hear. So if you're into that boy band type stuff with the dull bass and snare drum boring beat, this CD is for you. If you're a big Rod Stewart fan then buy it for the 3 normal Rod Stewart songs. I was quite disappointed with this CD."
4,Rod Stewart Balladeers again!,"Rod just can't resist it. Since he's into power ballads, Rock has left him for good. Long gone have the days wherein Rod screamed about Hot legs or Tora! Tora! Tora! Out with the Boys. Nowadays he has settled down (new wife and probably new kids underway?) and that suits him just fine. He has discovered that not all artists have to be like Mick and Keith -who will probably die Rockin'- and the style he has committed to is just right. This album definitly proves him right. The fact that he has not contributed any song to this album says something about the man. He has found out that he is not a songwriter, just the singer. No less and no more but at the same time Rod proves why he his right not songwriting: His voice-impact is stronger than ever!! Ballad after ballad brings tears to my eyes; Tears of joy! Sam and Otis have finally found the singer that -like the three tenors- will be remembered for their terrific singing! Hats off mr. Stewart!"
1,If I could rate this CD lower I would...,"and I have the right to say that. In one form or another I have everything the Rod ever did (including Human) and he is one of my all time favorites. I have defended his work for years even though I have seen it slip from its greatness of years gone by, knowing that every musician has the right to explore new territory, and I have managed to find something to cherish about every project he ever released without any trouble. But Human has left me VERY disappointed...this CD is not cohesive, nor is it original, features NOT ONE of Rod's band members from the past...guys that have helped Rod sign his work even as he navigated on the edge of many musical trends. I have been thinking this for years but never thought I needed to say it publicly until now: Rod, honey. I love you. We all love you. But please, for all our sakes, hole up for awhile and give us something you created. Please write your own material again...certainly you still have it in you?"
2,NO,"In his extensive musical career, Rod Stewart tried almost every style of music and songs. In ""Human"" he take a shot at the Neo Soul which seems only logical.However, and for unexplainable reason to me, 2 songs fit well with Stewart's voice and his legendary career, and the rest can be simply called Trash.RS tried to release a modern and fresh album, instead he sounds older than he ever was.This album is in my personal musical collection since I am an old fan of this great artist however it would be unfair to recommend this album to anyone else than the hardcore fans who wish to hear Stewart's voice in a new set of songs."
2,Dissapointing,"Changing withe the times to survive, Rod lost all creativity and spontaneity. THis CD demonstrate this very clearly. A shame."
3,This cd will grow on you..,"I have to admit I was not overly blown away by this cd the first few times I listened to it. But, it has started to grow on me and I am happy that i purchased this cd. Most of the songs are mellow, light rock type songs. It is not 1988 Rod Stewart but then again he is 55 years old, even rock stars mellow after awhile. If you have liked Rod's music in the past I think you will like this one but don't expect any songs like Hot Legs. I would call it a good make out cd. =)"
4,New Rod is very soulful indeed.,"Rod is back. Stewart's career has been one of changing with the times, remember the disco Stewart? Human finds Rod singing in the mode of the Backstreet Boys and Nsync. It has that old Motown production feel to it. And this type of slick R&B fits Rod's voice and phrasing very well. This is certainly not Rod Stewart's best CD, however it is very good. If you are fan of Rod Stewart, this one is for you. If not, you should try earlier efforts. However, it is nice to hear that Rod can still play the game. This is well liked by the staff and every time it is on the CD player, someone wanders in and goes, ""is that Rod Stewart?"" - ""I like this""."
5,"FRESH START, FRESH SOUND","I am a long time fan, and grew up on Rod's ""Rocking"" sound. I'll admit, when I heard samples of this, I thought Rod had sold out. However, he's taken his 80's sound (Which had run it's gambit) to the next level. It's a new sound, a little contemporary, but it's still 100%, CLASSIC ROD STEWART! All in all, this is one of his best albums of the last ten years! WELCOME BACK, ROD!"
4,Reassuring greatness,"Rod starts with Human the upbeat, optimistic praise of the human race and what is to come. Smitten is a great love ballad for Valentine's Day or any special occasion between two people.Soul and Loveless are more of the great upbeat songs that Rod is great at making his own even though he didn't write them. The songs all the way to I Can't Deny It contain the heart and soul of what Rod has felt and still feels for the women in his life. No matter whether it his current girlfriend, daughter, mother or even ex wife Rachel. This album contains the everlasting energy of Rod Stewart in what it means to be Human and in Love. All hail, Rod the Mod is back."
4,Beautiful CD,"I hesitated to buy this CD. I have been a Rod Fan for many years, since I first heard him on the radio in the 70's. After seeing him for the fourth time in concert a couple of weeks ago, he didn't sing one song from the CD even though it was called the Human Tour. I went out and bought it a few days ago. I saved the receipt and thought about returning it. I am glad I didn't. I popped it in the CD player today and was shocked at how beautiful it is. It's a little different from his usual style but variety can be good. If you love romantic songs and Rod Stewart. Buy this, you will enjoy it."
5,Rod the Mod Stewart(SUPERSTAR),"Dear all, I""ve been a fan of rod""s since childhood,what more can i say. The man""s a lyrical genious,gets better with age. I am now 42yrs old,thats got to say something wouldn""t ya say,or i am a sad old sod.(i think not)Tracks like Scarred and scared(Blonds album)to the recently popular(Don""t come arround here, of Human fame)to name but 2 very different but very distinct rod no""s lays down his talent for excercising his unique voice. cheers. to all, Vern. good talkin to ya."
4,Great surprise!,"While I'm not one to read about vampires, I got this from my husband and LOVED IT!!!! It is a fast read. Very clever and funny but with mystery."
4,A good second Christopher Moore,"Fortunately, I'd read ""Lamb"" before I read this book, so I was already hooked on Christopher Moore. This one was not nearly as clever or well researched, but it was enjoyable. I definitely plan to read the next one. I would strongly urge younger readers to first read Bram Stoker and Anne Rice. Do not let this be your first vampire novel. (I'd also recommend first reading Tales of the City, on which Moore seems to have based his cultural understanding of San Francisco).I would have given it 3.5 stars if Amazon would let me."
4,FUNNY!,This book is well written and extremely funny. I am looking forward to reading other books by Christopher Moore.
1,I Didn't Like Airplane Either...,"I will not give up on Christopher Moore entirely, just yet. I was told by a woman, whose opinion I trust, that he is very funny and that Bloodsucking Fiends is the worst example of his humor. That's a relief because I didn't find this funny at all. It was too much for me. It reminded me of the movie Airplane. Slapstick on paper. Just too ridiculous and silly to actually be funny. Hoping for better luck next time with this author..."
4,Didn't Know I Liked It Until It Was Over...,"So this is the kind of book where the reading is really easy, and you always feel like there's more to the story than you are actually getting. There's this need to read more into the story because you feel that Moore is too smart on the jokes on the reader rather than any character in the novel ...so you sort of aren't sure if you like it...like the not too popular kid who is a wallflower at a school dance, but then realizes he did have fun at the very end. So i guess I did enjoy this story ...even though it wasn't realistic, it was just entertaining. And after it was over, I surprisingly was attached to the characters and went in search of the next book in the series. So...hats off to Mr. Moore for being clever enough to trick me into liking a book that I thought I wasn't excited about, i guess I do appreciate his humor."
5,Normal characters like you and me,"One of the things I enjoy about Christopher Moore's work is he takes seemingly normal people like you and I and puts them into extraordinary situations...very, very extraordinary situations. Bloodsucking Fiends is a prime example. Both heroes, Jody and Tommy, are flawed not in comic-book, superheroey ways but in rather everyday ways. In other words, their flaws are very similar to the everyday internal challeges (self-doubt and common neuroses) and external challenges (the constraints of city life and mundane job-related issues) that most of us face every day. Moore's brilliance is that he takes these normal people we can relate to and allows us to witness them overcome everyday life obstacles along with things like becoming a vampire and battling an 800 year old vampire sire. Add his unique brand of humor to the whole mix and it amounts to a wonderful read that will make you laugh out loud at least a half dozen times if not more."
4,Awesome read,"I read You Suck before this book, so it cleared up a few ambiguities for me. Moore's usual brand of making dark topics light hearted is in full effect. A rollicking read."
4,Bloodsucking friends,"My son (15) and I have now both read this book (I have started 'you suck', and the boy is badgering me every day to get me to finish it so he can have it). It's a great anti-twilight; very funny, quite gritty and yet you still feel compassion for the characters."
4,Wacky humor but boring and predictable ending,"This is an easy five-day read that will have you crying and doubled over with laughter. It is the story of a professional San Francisco woman turned unwillingly into a vampire who falls in love with a ""fresh-off the boat from the midwest"" ""wanna-be writer"" who works nights at the Marina Safeway, stocking shelves and bowling with frozen turkeys. The author takes you on a wild ride of crazy plot twists and wackingly entertaining character developments. I read many passages out loud to friends. I was disappointed with the ending, however, because I felt as though the author chose to wrap it up by relying on the familiar ""let's kill the head vampire"" plot."
5,Always something happening keeping you on your toes.,"Great love story with hilaious happenings continously going on. Its funny, makes you laugh out loud, I love the way it keeps you wondering whats going to happen next ,it is another can't put the book down until I'm finished. Thanks we all need to laugh out loud and your books do that trick. Keep up the good work"
3,Didn't quite live up to the hype,"I really wanted to like this book. I like vampire books, I like comedy. This should be a great combination. But it's not. The comedy just seems too forced. And not really all that funny.The story doesn't quite hang together, and the last few pages seem like a tacked-on rush ending.There are some great characters here. The Emperor was my personal favorite. The book is quite fast-paced, and makes for light reading. I may try another of his, just to see if this is an acquired taste. Later."
3,Not Moore's best by a long shot,"Having read and enjoyed Lamb and A Dirty Job, I was disappointed by this one. The humor was at times too obvious -- I was occasionally pulled out of the narrative with the feeling that the author was winking at his readers instead of telling a story. The plot moved along at a good clip but came to an unsatisfying, too-easy resolution. The ""bad guy"" was an incomplete picture, someone whose motives and goals were never clear to me. And yet, despite these complaints, it was a fun read and easy to breeze through in a short time. I laughed out loud once or twice. I'm glad I read Bloodsucking Fiends, but I hope that the next Christopher Moore book I read is a better example of his work!"
3,Light funny fluff.,This book is an enjoyable read although I felt it didn't bring anything new to the genre and I felt the some of the characters were stereotyped. Having said all that I can't get away from that I found it a prefect good quick read (the type you read at lunch and on public transport) and it's very funny in parts.I would consider giving the author another go.
3,Fiendish Fun,"Bloodsucking Fiends, the third book by Christopher Moore, is a light-hearted, vampire love story set in San Francisco; filled with irreverent commentary on the city itself and character types found there.Follow the trials of Jody, the ""cute but not beautiful"" newborn vampire, as she struggles with her new life as a creature of the night and her vicious sire. C. Thomas Flood, pun intended I'm quite sure, SF newbie and late-night Safeway clerk falls in love with Jody and the romantic hijinx ensue! An enjoyable read, lots of humor and a solid book from a rising talent."
3,A different - and amusing - take,"A cute and comical contemporary vampire story. Moore's take on vampire lit is a nice break from modern ""horror"" conventions."
4,Quickly becoming one of my favorite authors,"This is definitely a fan for those who like their humor quirky! Bloodsucking Fiends revolves around a small-town boy who comes to the big city and the lady he meets one night working at the Safeway. But, as Shakespeare said, the course of true love never did run smooth and our boy's lady friend has just recently became a vampire. Moore has a gift for writing dialogue and his character development is superb. This is much more than a vampire story, but also a story about relationships, acceptance, and coming to terms with yourself. Moore wraps all of these moral lessons into a tight, quirky, and sarcastic bow. A definite read for those who like vampires, quirky dialogue, or just good books in general."
5,Bloodsucking Fiends,"After reading so many rave reviews for Christopher Moore books, I decided to read one. I'm not one for vampire stories, but I decided to give this one a try and I'm so happy that I did. This book was one of the funniest I've ever read. I rarely laugh out loud when I read a book, but I couldn't help myself with this one. What a sense of humor. Mr. Moore is so descriptive in his writing and paints such a clear picture that it's like you're actually there, observing from the sidelines. Especially hilarious were the scenes in the Safeway store, where Tommy worked nights with his crew, the Animals. What a gift this man has and how lucky we, as readers, are that he's shared it with us. I can't wait to read another of his books. From the looks of his reviews, I'll have a hard time picking. They all look like gems."
3,"Amusing, but so many typos","The story was amusing and fun. But this paperback contains a lot of typos and other errors, which distracted me and made it difficult to enjoy reading it. I wanted to take a red pen to the book and then send it back to the publisher."
4,Compelling Intro To a Thoroughly Enjoyable Series,"It is clear that this is certainly one of Mr. Moore's first books. The editing style, and some of the prose is slightly different. As well, some of the cultural references are a tad bit dated; however, it flows well and had me laughing on several occasions. A great light-hearted read."
4,Like a vampire Bridget Jones,"San Francisco, my favorite city, is the perfect setting for this weird combination of a vampire story and a kind of Bridget Jones career-girl novel (but much much funnier than either progenitor).Christopher Moore's books usually start off with a chapter or two establishing the premise, then he appears to eat some weird mushrooms or something and get hallucinagenically funny. ""Bloodsucking Fiends"" is cheerfully wacko from the get-go when 26-year-old Jodi is attacked by a vampire in the first seconds of a book, turns into a creature of the night, and still manages to find true love with the night manager of a Safeway grocery store.In fact, the love story bit was so winsome that I was a bit disappointed when the story got genuinely macabre in the last few pages. As usual though, Moore's devotion to lunacy and his sharply-written minor characters more than compensate for a few loose ends in the plot."
5,How is this not a movie?,"Funny, clever, great characters, well written, witty. This seems to have been slightly ahead of the curve with regard to the vampire genre, and the style makes it post modern, visual, and fast moving. How has this not been turned into a movie? The trilogy would be great, so I wonder how this characters were overlooked by filmmakers looking for compelling story and intriguing characters. It is a great and easy read, lots of fun - nothing not to love!"
3,"The book was good, but not what I expected.","The book was a little hard to read, but it was not what I expected. I bought it because a friend of mine recommended it."
2,Half-hearted comedy with no point...,"Jody is your everyday ""Jane"" with an average life. That is until she's attacked and turned into a vampire. Now on her own Jody realizes that she needs human help. Enter would be author C. Thomas Flood. Now time is running out for the odd couple as they try and find out more about Jody's attacker and why he's setting them up for the series of killings plauging the city. ""Blood Sucking Fiends..."" is written in an erratic and skittish style, causing the story to jump rather than flow together. It also lacks substance and cohesiveness as if Moore came up with the initial idea and threw a bunch of ""What If's?"" around it. There are a few laughs but not enough to raise this book above its shortcomings."
1,Overpriced,"Right of the bat, this review isn't about Moore's writing style or his stories themself (both of which I love) but rather the pricing.Unfortunately I'd picked up a paperback version of the sequel to this book first, 'You Suck' and was interested in getting this one for my Kindle. Prior to logging in, the book was priced at $11.99; after logging in the price jumped up to $19.38 due to 'applicable taxes'. 65% price increase for an ebook? Seems a little ridiculous to me.When ebooks start costing more than the paperback editions (this one is priced at $10.19) it's just sad.I'm sorry Moore, I'm a supporter but that is a bit much for as a college student. Maybe when the price drops..."
4,"Good, quick beach-type read","As a huge fan of Moore's ""Lamb"", I was hoping for a similar quality book from this series. Though the story is a quick read, funny in places, and overall relatively entertaining, it does not come close to the hilarity and insightfulness of ""Lamb."" I typically re-read books over and over, but this is one I have yet to pick up since my initial reading."
4,Fair quality - good book!,"The quality of the book was fair, it had been well loved by others but it didn't stop me from enjoying the book! I do suggest reading this one before You Suck though, it will make You Suck much more clear."
4,This book was so funny!!!,I loved this book! It was so funny and the vampires were pretty cool. This book would have made a very nice series and the part about the turkey bowling in the supermarket was so funny! I recommend this book as well as Desires Unleashed and The Guilty Innocent by D.N. Simmons
4,A Primer on the Power and Personality of the Holy Spirit,"When Paul Yonggi Cho speaks about the Holy Spirit, I listen.As senior pastor of the world's largest Christian Church (more than 850,000 members), and founder and prayer warrior at Prayer Mountain, Seoul, South Korea, Cho knows about prayer and the Holy Spirit.The book covers a lot of ground, much of it introductory: Who is the Holy Spirit, the baptism, the gifts, and the evidence. Interspersed are personal stories and testimonies which are, in Cho's unique style, disarming, humbling, and heart-warming.More than anything, Cho's heart for God and love for people raditates through the book.The mature believer and the Cho student may want to skip this book and buy ""Apocalyptic Prohecy"", ""Prayer the Brings Revival"", or ""The Fourth Dimension"" for meatier study. But if this is your first foray into Pastor Cho's work, enjoy!"
2,not thebest,"the HOLY SPIRIT is real and full of FIRE,,,we assist HIM and HE helps us remeember the past spiritual battles and how ti win in life, this author tries to get us to make GOD our partner,,,but missed the point,,,,,Flesh does not Dwell in HEAVEN,,,,so spirit is not going to build up our fleshly desires on earth,,,,it wont work, Honor God and God will Honor us back,,,he is NOT our servant,,Angels Serve,,Jesus serves,,,the HOLY SPIRIT BURNS up and purifies us, HE IS NOT going to be our partner, He is GOD and we bow to HIM.."
4,"Very useful, needs better editing","I have this book open nearly every time I work on my bike. It's given me a lot of confidence in many of my own maintenance activities. However, there are errors in it that if not spotted would possibly cause problems and some of the pictures suffer from horrid resolution and lack of proper light or contrast which make it a little guesswork in finding the parts in question.The index is relatively useless, leaving out a TON of shortcuts. It relies on indexing only the major sections and not usually the parts you might be looking for info on.Even so, if you have a baby 'ceptor, and aren't already inclined as a bike mechanic, this is a must have."
4,Opportunistic excellence,"Vallabhaneni does an excellent job of presenting essential information in a no-nonsense, time-saving style that maximizes value-add to the reader. For the ""opportunistic"" reader, Vallabhaneni's book is an excellent tool for cutting to the core of the requirements for the CISA exam. My only source was Vallabhaneni and I passed the dreaded CISA exam at first attempt."
1,Why?,"Why do you need this book. I passed the exam without ever studying for it. I didn't think it was difficult. In my opinion, if you have to study for the exam you shouldn't be in the profession."
3,very good show,this is a great show! if you like the twilight zone this is a must. the price is very good but i think that the 8 disc set is the best you can get.
4,A Sleeper Film Makes Good,"This is a case of an independent film making good. The story goes that Tom Cruise read it, fell in love with, and threw his considerable resources behind a small film and director from Sacramento, California that noone had ever heard of. This film makes Training Day seem like a children's story, and is a must see addition to fans of films like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Boondock Saints. You're not a true film buff if you haven't seen this film."
5,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES ! ! ! ! ! ! !,"I loved this movie. One of the best I've seen. Great performances and plot including the setting. Unbelivable performances by RAY LIOTTA and JASON PATRIC. Great action and a very huge twist at the end. If you like descent thriller/action movies, then watch this one. I think you should see this one as soon as you can. I belive this one is my favorite movie. GO AND WATCH IT. YOU WON'T REGRET IT ! ! ! !"
5,One Of The Best Cop Films,"Narc is up there with Heat as one of the best cop films of all time. It's gritty, raw, dramatic, thrilling, etc.Liotta's and Patric's performance are brilliant with great direction by Carnahan. The visual style he uses in this film brings the rawness and the realistic feel to the viewer.This is definitely a must rental and a buy. Highly recommended."
5,Dark and twisted.....,"One of the best crime thriller films that I have had the pleasure of viewing. Very dark and destructive. It shows how deeply undercover some cops can become when ignored by their peers and the society surrounding. Very surreal use of colors and great cinematography. If anyone has enjoyed films involving police corruption and the politics surrounding that corruption like ""Training Day"", ""The French Connection"", etc. should truly appreciate this great effort. Not too well known or reviewed by critics but nonetheless those of us who know what makes a good movie will appreciate the great performances displayed by all the actors involved and the great story that is told with such integrity and such vigor. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys great cinema!"
2,Predictable and boring,"I'm all for ""guy movies"". As a matter of fact, give me a good western or action-packed drama any day over sappy love stories that are basically rejects from the Lifetime channel (eeeuuuu!)This movie was so incredibly boring from the beginning that it was really hard to get to the chase scenes and the storyline. Ray Liotta (what a hunk!) plays a disturbing role as a cop on a vengence to find the murderer of his partner. Predictable acting. Predictable ending."
1,WAY!!!!!!!!! Too much profanity!!!!!,"This film is loaded with nearly 300 uses of the ""F"" word, and it also features some of the bloodiest violence I've ever seen in a cop film. Absolute waste of time!"
1,this is a racist movie!!,"I find this movie offensive that it glamorize police brutality and racism...two white cops slap around black and hispanic criminals calling them ""N***er"" and ""spic"" doesn't really work for me. It's too close to reality of police brutality."
4,Narc,"Narc is a great movie. I think the acting is played out VERY good, and the storyline keeps you interested until the end.Ray Liotta stands out the most acting wise to me. Jason Patric falls right behind doing also a great job in acting. The story kept me interested, you want to know the next move theyre going to make. This movie is based around criminals and the drug underworld. Liotta and Patric team up to find out who was really behind everything that went on around Calvess.I highly recommend this movie, its entertaining and keeps up the action. There are quite a few twists in the movie, more towards the end so pay attention so you can see whats really going on.Overall, I give this movie about a 4.5/5. I thought the ending could have been a little different since I don't think it really led anywhere. But check this movie out you wont be dissapointed."
4,Very good film,"This is a very good film. It's hard edged, tough to watch at times, surprising and intellectually interesting. I've gotten a little tired of so-called hard-edged films and tv dramas that are really a bit lame, not original, like cheap imitations of real life. This film doesn't feel like that. From the very first scene it's got you gripped. This stuff happens and even if it's a nightmare in some ways it's valueable to watch and consider. It unfolds like a crime thriller should, but the why's and how's are unique enough to mark it as special. And the two lead actors give great performances. Neither of them are prema-donnas. There's no Brad Pitt here. But Patrick and Liotta deliver the real thing - quality, understated and yet large acting. This is a treat really. I was surprised."
5,READ THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Ray Liotta in his best performance since Goodfellas!!!!! NArc is dark and violent but i loved it!! if u like cop dramas this is the movie for you!!! NArc gets a 10!!!!!!!!
5,Gritty Ride,"This grabbed my attention from the start, taking me on a gritty ride all the way to the end. The strength of the film is both the acting and story. Nothing is glamorized or as it seems. Just when you expect things to work out a certain way, they don't! Well worth the viewing!"
4,Jason Patrick's Best performance!!!,This movie without a doubt shows Jason Patrick and Ray Liotta's Acting skill. In my opinion this is Jason Patrick's best performance to date.The style of Direction adds realism to the movie.definitely worth owning
4,Good intro textbook to seismology,"I have used this textbook for an intro to seismology class in college and have found it to be very detailed and covered a wider range of topics compared to other seismology textbooks. This book focus a great deal on deriving equations, so if you are a math person, it'll be a great way for you to learn. Problem sets at the end of each chapter are challenging but not totally impossible; and like most textbooks, only some of the answers are on the back. There are a few mistakes I found in the diagrams, but not it's not a big deal. Overall, I do recommend this book as an intro text book geared towards the upper level undergraduates or graduate students."
3,Fairly low-level,"It was required for a class. I prefer the Shearer book as an intro to seismology. This is fine, but it's too basic to be a very useful reference beyond an introductory course."
1,Why?,"I have no idea why this was even put out? It ranks up there with Pink floyds ""a grt collection of dance songs."" Both are non essential grt hits albums. If you're looking for a decent compilation go for hit parade which has 15 songs. Besides any self-respecting audio a fan already has almost all the albums that these songs has. Bottom line anybody with brains already knows to avoid this like the flu. So why am I reviewing this."
5,Mark VII Mens short sleeve knit golf shirt,I've had this shirt for more than a year. Shirt material has excellent body that holds shape. Minimal color fade after washing. Fit is true to size.
3,Hold out for a better HVLP,"I've had this unit for a couple of years now...and in short it's priced fairly. Not too great but not too bad. It got me started with HVLP. It just does not have enough power for shooting any thick (even kinda thick) finish. If you just want to shoot waterborne poly it works fine.I wanted to shoot paint and oil based poly. For paint, forget it. Even with the heavy needle it just shoots splatter. For oil based poly it can't shoot a smooth even finish. With the heavy needle in it you get orange peel.It was a good intro machine for me, but I ended up going for the top endAccuspray on the second go round. Triple the price but you get professional results (why waste your time spraying if you get sub-par results?) and 3M's PPS which makes clean up a breeze. You know it's hard to justify the price for an expensive unit but think how many hours you have into your project. Why risk an average finish on it."
4,"Product Good, Customer Service Lousy","I've only used the HV2500 sprayer a couple of times and it worked fine, although I wish the gun was made of metal instead of plastic. My real issue is with Campbell Hausfeld's customer service. The QD (quick disconnect) was missing from my sprayer. Since I needed one immediately, I drove 20 miles to their nearest dealer and shelled out $13.62 from my own pocket for one. Even though my sprayer was now complete, I decided to test CH's customer service - I called their customer service line and explained that my QD was missing and that I needed one ASAP. That was at least 4 weeks ago and I still have no QD (from them). I have followed up with several emails directly to the customer service rep I spoke to and have gotten no response. Because of the lousy customer service, I can't recommend their products."
3,HVLP Paint Sprayer,"I like the unit but it does take some getting used to. If I had one comment to make,I would say that the company should probably provide a little more instruction or insight in using the tool."
2,Great product; not packaged properly for shipping,"I've had experience with two CH sprayers now, and this one lives up to the expectations for quality and usability. I highly recommend this sprayer, however I strongly urge buyers to obtain from a different vendor. I received the sprayer as a gift and did not open the box until after the 30-day period. Although the box was in fine shape, there was almost no protective packaging inside to prevent damage to the spray can which easily gets dented by the unit. My spray can is completely unusable due to shipping damage. CPO Outlet was responsive but has directly refused to replace the damaged part. I will have to buy my own replacement as a result of their lack of proper shipment."
1,does nothing well,"Don't waste your money on this. Put a little more with it and but a real spray system. The really weak part is the gun. I am on my second and have yet to get anything other than Orange peel. I have reconciled the systems shortcomings and now only use it to spray stain. CH has sent me replacement units but will not consider any product exchange. They also know how weak the system is...Oh by the way, I have the 3300, which is supposed to be superior to the above model."
5,Can you feel the bass?,"This is exactly the type of book I would expect from an artist who isn't a professional writer: a collection of thoughts, stories, jokes, drawings, advices, etc. This one is very well done too.As for the author, mr. Levin is one of my major inspirations when it comes to playing the bass guitar. The legendary ""funk fingers"" are only a part of his genius, you can find more by reading his book.One of my surprises was that he enjoys as much as myself the authentic italian espresso coffee."
2,somewhat amusing and entertaining,"If you enjoy reading about an egocentric bass player and his experiences in the music business then this book is for you. I found some of his anecdotes amusing but worthless otherwise. There are a few tips, many of which you can easily get from other musicians you meet on the road (or from a good instructor). Get it if you're curious but if you want to be a better player from this book it's a waste of time."
1,"This book has no scientific basis, and it is almst hypocritic!!",This book is nostalgic and has no scientific basis on anything.I do agree with the author in one point: Ritalin is given away without any battery of exams.The author complains about the fact that society is too fast paced!The book is highly based on the author's opinion. DO NOT PURCHASE IT if you are trying to find a real sociologial or scientifical explanation for this disorder!
5,Extremely well-documented and insightful,"Aside from DeGrandpre's masterful deconstruction of the ""ADHD"" phenomenon, this book offers a unique perspective on the impact of speeding up our activities and lives. This is vastly superior to Gleick's recent book ""Speed,"" for example. Looking at ADHD as some sort of brain disorder is a uniquely North American view, and it has to be tied to larger social trends in North America. This book argues brilliantly that kids benefit least from this view, and that the longer-term impact of providing them with pharmacological stimulation are bound to be devastating. If you enjoy keeping your head firmly in the sand, don't read this book."
1,Beware,"Received parts from 2 different models, one of which had been discontinued. Parts were not compatible. Only recourse offered was the return with a vague promise to refund shipping by Amazon. Chose to manipulate hardware and supply needed parts to make pieces work. I was told it would take 6-8 weeks to receive the 6 screws needed to make the incompatible part work. There is a letter at the end of the model number and the -A model is discontinued. You don't know what you are getting until it arrives since and you see the schematic for the stand. Frustrating. 5 contacts both email and by phone were made with limited results."
4,Very pretty but hard to put together,"I purchased this plant stand to use during my wedding. It's lovely and elegant, but is kind of difficult to put together. I would recommend it to a friend."
2,"28"" Revolving Curl Bar","Unfortunately, this revolving bar as received did not revolve well at all. I had to file down several metal burrs at the rotating points and lube it up with grease to make it turn semi-decently. It still ""grabs"" on occasion, which is kind of annoying at the end of a tough workout."
4,Good Candy for the Candy Lover !,"If you happen to be one of those individuals who enjoys snacking while watching TV or a DVD, these will be as welcome on your lap as your favorite pussy cat. Smooth, creamy and a not overpowering Mocha taste, which some don't like, include me in that group. You will enjoy these as much as the other Caramoo flavors. My only complaint is Amazon's ongoing problem with shipping food products past it's 'Best By' date. Not an uncommon occurance for them. !!!! Try these, you'll like them."
5,Excellent,"I loved this book. It is one that I always recommend for those interested in California history, especially if you are familiar with the Oroville, Chico area."
5,Madly Enthusiastic!!,"Arthur Mountaniol's ""5 Song Debut"" album is full of passion with a madly driven vibe.Hard Rock in its post decaying beauty spiced up with jazzy influences and atonal lead guitar ""cockroaching"" runs especially in the songs:""Olympus"" and ""Criminal One"".Arthur Mountaniol delivers outstanding vocals,guitar playing and exciting songwriting with lyrics of a cutting edge,bizarre originality.I recommend this CD to anyone who loves Hard Rock the way it was meant to be,yet with a bit of unique refreshment."
4,Hot Debut!,"Arthur Mountaniol is a world class rock guitarist and singer who has a level and capacity like those of Ritchie Blackmore and Freddy Mercury.He's a great songwriter too.His ""5 Song Debut"" is quite a beginning,a really hot thing to start with.Musically it's an unusual blend of hard rock with a jazzy twist.If you're into Classic Rock,you will love this CD."
3,"At the begining I was very pleased, but...","At the begining I was very pleased, but after 6 months of not so much use, the poor thing started to freeze on me, it'd take for ever just to load or delete songs, and it was automatically syncing songs I already had in it, so it was doubling my memory usage.The sound quality is ok. The music manager software if easy to use and the size and weight of this device are very nice, but if you are going to buy it, I recomend to get the extended warranty as I did.I gave this product 3 stars, because if you are lucky enough to make it work for 1 or 2 years, it's a good player for an affordable price. I like the fact that included a case, and an Ac charger. Most players don't include them, so you'll be spending more money in the long term."
1,Great product... FOR THREE MONTHS,"I had it working great until after three months, the mp3 just wouldn't turn on. well it would but it would show the ""RIO"" welcome screen and then turn off and it would do that again and again and again. I tried charging the stupid thing and it would go berserk. As mentioned in the manual i tried to reinstall the firmware + trying everything else i could think of. No use.I absoloutely DO NOT recommend this, you should buy any other thing."
2,"Disappointing product, poor customer support","I'm on my 2nd Carbon due to the fact that the volume knob broke off of the first one I owned. I've had the replacement player for just under 3 months and it has locked up in ""upgrader"" mode. I've followed the directions on the website which didn't help. I then called customer support. That didn't help. Their rep asked me if I walked with the Carbon. I told her yes. She then breaks into a lecture about how I can't walk with the Carbon.Bottom line - they won't replace a less than 90 day old product that has malfunctioned, and blamed me for the problem. Now that's customer service!Nice job Rio. Should have bought an iPod."
2,dont buy thumbwheel products from Rio,We bought a 6Gb Rio Carbon Pearl which failed with a broken thumbwheel in 70 days. After 3 weeks (18 May -- 6 June) Rio support come back to me with this line:Unfortunately broken scrollwheels / powerbuttons are not covered by the warranty. We do not do off warranty repairs. The is due to fact that repairing and shipping a Rio is more expensive than a new player.I think the most telling point is the comment that this company has poor reputation at the Better Business Bureau.
3,$200 disposable MP3 player!,"The sound quality is awesome. It is very easy to use. But the so-called ""20 hour battery life"" is not true. It runs down very fast. And you can't ever change the battery! Using licensed songs from on-line companies can run the battery down, but I don't use those. Having the volume high will run it down, but I keep it low. When I contacted Rio, they took two weeks to answer and they did not help me. When I turn it off and turn it on, the battery life sinks noticeably. Again, Rio is not helpful at all. I am sorry I used all of my MP3 money on this item."
1,Very fine product WHEN it works.,"Mine does an automatic reboot on a regular basis while trying to listen to music. I don't think I have ever had it play for more that 30 minutes. I notified Rio of this, they assigned a ""case number"" and made a suggestion for a solution. By the time I tried the ""solution"" and found that it did nothing it was beyond the warranty period. I am now trying to negotiate having it covered under warranty, although I doubt that I will have much luck.Don't buy this if you want a reliable product and don't want to throw your money away."
2,Don't buy a discontinued product!,Rio seems to be getting out of the MP3 player business. Like many others my volume dial broke in 6 months (3 mos past the VERY short warranty) so Rio would only offer me $99 for another from their remaining inventory. They aren't making any more and to the best my knowledge are getting out of the MP3 business altogether.I also agree with some of the other cons: short battery life and poor recording quality.
5,"Great read, but don't start here","I've been a fan since meeting Asaro at a BayCon in 1997 and purchasing her first two books. Since then, I've followed her Empire as it became increasingly complex and rich. Spherical Harmonic will be confusing as an introduction. Unlike Primary Inversion, The Last Hawk and The Quantum Rose; Spherical Harmonic doesn't stand alone. It brings great detail and development to the Ruby Pharaoh, but without the background of three or four of the earlier books, figuring out what is happening, much less why, is tough.So, buy it, Primary Inversion and Catch The Lightning. You'll be back for more."
4,The Analog reviewer speaks...,"Watch for a positive review in the April 2002 Analog.Asaro's emphasis here is less on romantic entanglements than on political intrigue: The Skolian and Trader Empires are seriously damaged by their war, but past romances hold out a hope of reconciliation.Asaro is an absorbing storyteller whose greatest contribution is her insistent reminder that brain and heart need not be separate."
2,"Catching up with the Skolian Empire, without the sex","If you follow the Saga of the struggling Skolian Empire, this volume will fill in some gaps, on the same timeline as Ascendant Sun(keep it to hand while reading). The oft-in-the-background Pharaoh, Dehya attempts to catch up with events, friends and family.As a first person storyline, this time the narrator was unconvincing. Asaro managed this trick well twice with Kelric in earlier stories, so not sure what happened here.... Political earthquakes also rumble almost unnoticed..."
3,Less a book than a report,"This is definitely not the book to try first if you're new to Catherine Asaro's Skolian novels. Though it opens with drama and tension, that tension vanishes as soon as the danger does. The structure here, unfortunately, is a series of very long reports of backstory interwoven with scenes--and with Asaro's trademark delicious physics divertimenti. It's hard to stay with this one; the internal thrust just isn't there, instead, the reader sticks with it to find out what happens to characters from other books they know and love. Either Asaro needed to write a whopping big novel so that events could be in realtime, or this should have been two or three books.Fans will want to have it to know what's going on. New people, do try PRIMARY INVERSION or THE LAST HAWK for a more engrossing, and more linear, introduction to the Skolain empire and its leaders. This one is not the place to start."
3,Great story - awful Kindle transcription,"I'd rate the story a 5, the Kindle transcription a 1 only because 0 isn't a rating. So my rating is a 3 - the average of the two scores.This REALLY needs to be re-released with the typos fixed."
4,Lovely,Lovely work. Interesting exploration of the human form but would prefer a little more diversity to give a greater picture so to speak.
3,Bodice Ripper,"A fun, predictable ""bodice ripper"" category - an airplane read - focus is not essential - but could get you through the bumpy spots."
1,Waste of Money,If you want to waste your money this is what to waste it on. I purchased this at $15.99 at Walgreens. It does NOT massge your legs. It simply inflates and deflates and inflates again like a blood pressure monitor cuff. It has so much tubing on it I almost strangled myself putting the boots and thigh wraps on. And it made the most hideous high pitched squealing as it inflates that my dog was howling. I took it back to Walgreens an hour after I purchased it.
3,air press massager,Good price - worked well for my husband after hip surgery to keep the circulation going. kinda noisy but not unbearable.
2,Not great as a massager.,"As a massager this leaves a little to be desired, a lot if you have ever had a good leg massage....but I bought this as an aid to get rid of/ and control the edema in my feet and ankles.The medical compression boots are 129.00 each, so I thought that I would try these.They did work for my problem and if I could give them a 5 star rating for this I would, but they only get a 2 for a massager!"
5,This Cracklecruch is not for Breakfast......,"A fun read, a must for all bad, tough, mean, wicked, horrible and hard-headed among us, and for those who just might aspire to be any of the above. . In additionan educational explanation of ""strange and long words"" used throughout, nice touch. Wonderous illustrations. CD alone worth the price."
4,Does the job,"feels good, fits well, only downside is how fast it wears down, but that's more of a problem with the pool I swim at in general"
5,Very good suit,"I use it for my training every week and I have even used it on a competition. This is suit is very good for both, it does not retain a lot of water and feels smooth under water."
4,Sizing info,"I normally wear a size 32 in pants, and after reading other reviews on Amazon I order these in a size 34. Originally they fit great and were not too tight. However, I've noticed that that material has loosened up quite a bit in the last few weeks and is now a little loose. I purchased the same thing at a store in town on sale, but this time in size 32. It was tight the first time I put it on, but has since loosened up some and is now very comfortable and the fit is much better then the 34."
5,nice suit,"This suit fits well, I ordered one size larger. Liked everything about this suit, the color and how it fits."
5,comfort and performance,"i went through 3 pairs of swim suit in the last 12 month, i purchased this one because it claim to last longer, and IT DID! i swim almost everyday, and so far no sagging of any kind. the length of the legs are perfect too. unlike other swim suits i bought from Nikes before, it doesn't restrict the movement of the body. i am very please with this purchase."
2,"Too thin, too small","I was disappointed. These are more like underwear than a swim suit. Because of other reviews, I bought a 38"" waist when I normally wear a 36"". They are still too snug, especially if you want to wear something underneath for support or modesty."
5,Best price for jammers,"I was a little concerned about the lighter color (sapphire blue) being a bit transparent, but this is not the case. These shorts fit well and seem to be true to size."
3,Nice Fit...Almost,"I wear this suit for water aerobics. I used to wear convention boxer-style trunks but they created a lot more drag than I wanted during the exercises. I love the way these jammer-style trunks fit and feel in the water. The trouble in paradise is the waistband, which is a simple drawstring design. During exercises the drawstring tends to roll down my abdomen a couple of iterations requiring me to spend an inordinate part of my exercise time readjusting my waistband."
5,well made,"These swim trunks are well made and the material is thick and durable. My legs are muscular so they seem tight in the legs but fit well otherwise, for the average person they will fit good. When these finally wear out (Years) I will get more."
5,A fine bathing suit for lap swimming,"I wear these for lap swimming and end up replacing them about once a year, which is a reasonable lifetime as far as I am concerned, given how often I swim (I'm in the pool three times a week).I like them enough that I've bought the same pair the last 3 times I've had to replace my suit."
3,"Okay jeans, Run a little big.",They're weird fitting on me. Not particularly comfortable nor cute. The color is not that flattering either. I guess I'll use them for gardening. The only reason why I gave it 3 stars is because of the price and free shipping (through amazon prime).
5,Nice jeans,I hesitate in buying jeans without trying them on but at this price I took a chance.The color is nice and they fit really well.A definite A+++++++
1,poor description and off sizing,"I purchased in size 8 and 10 because no sizing chart, both were off, no details in description and fit wasn't what it looked like in picture, should have been listed as a juniors items, not a misses item, fit is not a regular misses fit, a 10 in misses is always more than big enough, that's why I also ordered size 8, didn't send back, trying to find someone to buy them off me."
4,Love it!,It fits perfectly in my sink and the baby is comfortable on the soft cushion. It is only good for a short time in the sink because eventually your baby grows too long for the cushion! I was still very pleased.
5,Soft and easy for our newborn.,"I bought it for our newborn because it looked soft and comfy to sit in. So far, we love and so does she. I was right. It is comfy. We'll see if it works when she is bigger. So far, I find it to be great! I'd buy it again. I don't have to worry about her comfort. Her head rests easily. My little one is small, but it works great for her. So far so good! You do have to make certain that you watch your baby so that she doesn't roll, but this would apply to any bath item anyway. After some washings in the washing machine, it has lost some of its fullness and has gotten a little flat, but now that my baby is bigger, she won't lay flat in it anyway. We still use it in the tub for softness. It doesn't last forever, probably, but it has worked well and I'd still buy it again. It is easy to store and it isn't tedious or bulky in comparison to other bath tubs. We can even use it in the sink because it will fold, of course."
3,Not what I expected,"The Safer Bather has not held up the way I expected it to. I've been bathing my five month old daughter in it in the big bath tub for about a month now because she outgrew her infant tub, and I have to admit, based on the other reviews, I thought it would be a much better product. The top part that is bulkier is flatting out, and because my daughter kicks so much in the tub it still slides some. I just washed it today and it's all bent out of shape and feels as if the foam inside has ripped on one side, and there are now a bunch of ""pills"" all over it. I gave it 3 stars because I never encountered any musty smell at all, and it is better than nothing. I would simply rinse, wring and hang it after each use. I'm disappointed with this product and glad I did not purchase it with my own money - I used a gift card. I'm glad other moms have had such great luck with the Safer Bather. Hope this helps."
2,Needs to be washed after each use,"This bath is very comfy for babies and worked well for our newborn during sponge baths. However, if you use it in the tub it needs to be washed in the wash machine each time to prevent it from getting smelly (and totally useless). Plus, if your baby poops during the bath it can stain the material."
1,waste of money,"Friend recommended this bather. I used plastic tub first 3 months, when baby outgrew it I gave this cushion a try. I have a double kitchen sink; cushion took up too much room so I've been using it in the bathtub. I'd rinse it and hang it to dry and it would still be wet the next night. It's been 3 months now and mildew is starting to form. I also didn't like the way baby layed down flat during bath. I am going to buy a toddler tub asap."
1,Dont like the product; hate the mold :( BUY SOMETHING ELSE!,"We bought this product for use after our baby out grew his spa baby (LOVE THE SPA BABY!) When we got it, it was a little misshapen. After a month of use and through drying after each use, this thing stunk like mildew! I threw this thing away and now I am buying a bath chair. My advice would be to buy a spa baby for months 1-5 and a bathing chair for months 6+. Dont waste your $$ on this moldy thing! :("
5,Wonderful Travel Tub,"This is our ""second"" tub for baby and it is wonderful. We live a two hour drive from Grandparents and it is perfect to take on trips when you plan to stay the weekend or longer. You can just throw it in your car and it hardly takes up any room. This is a must buy if you make a lot of trips by car!"
3,"good, but it does end up getting moldy",i was afraid to just have my son in the tub once he got too big for the infant tub. this is when he started to sit up on his own and would have fallen out of the plastic kid tubs. so we put him on this and it was helpful until it started to get mold spots on it. i washed it in the washing machine but this did not get the stains away. I'd say its good but only for a short period of time.
3,Like My Primo Bathtub More,"I got this from a lady who said she tried 3 plastic tubs 1st and they all scared her. I tried stuffing this in the bathroom sink and it was better than nothing. She pooped on it and it was hard to wash out. Pretty much the first 6 weeks we spot cleaned Miss Baby on a towel on the changing pad, excepting the one time in the sink. Then as recommended by Dr. Sears I sat in the bath with her and nursed her while I bathed her. Then we switched to the Primo tub, which we also got as a gift. I like it a lot more. I just fold an small towel over the top to cushion her head. The saddle thing that comes between her legs seems safer without a cushion jammed in on top of it."
5,WORTH IT'S WEIGHT IN GOLD !!!!,A miracle occurred in our house tonight... bathtime was a blast!!! After six weeks of sponge baths (a terrible experience for all of us) we used this product for the first time and my daughter loved it! We put her down on the pillow and she immediately broke into this huge smile! My husband started taking pictures and I gave her the bath myself because it was so easy with this pillow. We all laughed and giggled through the whole thing and then before my daughter was dry...she fell into a lovely peaceful sleep! BUY THIS TODAY!!!!
5,Great Cushion - Makes Bathtime Fun,"I absolutely love this cushion. After reading the reviews on the website we purchased this for our son - also after trying to bath him in the sink (what a nightmare!) He has gone from hysterically screaming during bathtime to smiling. It makes this daily ritual so pleasant. We only have one tub in our house and we have not experienced any mildew problems in the two months we have been using it. We hang it on the shower head to dry and once it's dry we move it to the back of the door where we hang our towels.Great product.UPDATED 1/2010Well, this cushion lasted through two babies. But, we moved from our apartment to an old farmhouse. The bathroom isn't ventilated enough for me to feel comfortable using this cushion, because I don't think it will dry enough. Great cushion, though, two babies adored it."
4,Good alternative to Baby Tubs,"We really like this product as an alternative for buying a baby tub. We have a small apt. and don't have the space for a tub. We used the Safer Bather first in the kitchen sink and now in the bathtub. It's worked great for both. We just rinse and squeeze out the excess water and have had no problems with mildew.The only problem I see is that it's starting to get a little flattened as time goes on, but I expected that to happen.Great product!"
3,Great product except for mildew,"I purchased this item due to the great reviews. My granddaughter was born July 1, and my daughter really liked the Safer Bather, as well as my granddaughter, who would stop crying when she was put in the bather in warm water. But, now the bather has mildew on it and she can't use it. My daughter did hang it up to dry as instructed, but it still mildewed."
2,Too Big For Sink,I purchased this to use while giving my 3 month old son a bath in the sink. I found it to be too awkward to use in the sink. I was unable to keep my son's head elavated without having to hold him up. It might work better in the tub with more room.
5,Better than the rest,"I got the safer bather for counter top bathing my newborn. We used it then with good results and are now using in the big tub for her baths at four months old. I tried a molded plastic tub, but baby hardly got wet and certainly couldn't enjoy her bathtime! She spent the whole bath trying to wiggle deeper into the water and always ended up lying with her back right on that bump meant to support her bum. With the safer bather we use a lot more water, but baby gets to lounge comfortably with water over all but that big belly and her head/face.As to complaints about odor, we haven't had that problem at all. I just hang it up after bath time. But, the product instructions do caution you not to use soaps with moisturizer which build up in the bather. I've avoided same and smells, no problem!"
4,Great For A While,"I used this in our kitchen sink up until my son was about five months old. My son loved it, and it really is convenient to use. The only downfall was that after a couple months or so, the material developed a mildewy smell (yuck!). Yes, we diligently hung it to dry immediately after each use, making sure that there was plenty of air circulation to facilitate drying. The only way around it was to scrub the tub with lots of soap. Even still, I was not confident that it was as clean as I'd like it to be. Aside from that, it served us well."
3,Great For Baby -- Hassle For Parent,"Have to give this item a mixed review. It's great from the standpoint of being comfortable and safe for your baby. My son nestles right in and loves his bath time. It's also easy to throw in the car for traveling. But it's somewhat of a pain in the neck for tired parents. It's basically a giant sponge -- absorbs a ton of water, gets heavy, and has to be wrung out after every use. (And with daily use, it never quite seems to dry out.) May not sound like a big deal, but it's one more ""have to"" do thing at the end of the day."
4,"Great for Travel, Great added cushion","I love this for travel, It's lightweight and dries quickly. Just store in a grabage bag. At home I prefer not to use it alone because it just lays flat. THE PICTURE OF THE BATHER IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN AN INFANT TUB! BY ITSELF IT DOES NOT RECLINE. I've been using it with the Eurobath since my son was 2 mo & is now almost 8 months. I now use it on the sitting side of the Euro bath for warmth,cushion,& support as he can't sit unassisted. MY ADVICE, GET SAFER BATHER AND THE EUROBATH."
5,best bath product ever!,"a freind told me about this after i had my 3rd child, and i totally love it. its easier and better than those foam tubs i've used in the past, its easy to hang and dry, its soft and it retains its softest and shape even when its wet!"
2,it was great until...,"I searched and searched and thought I found the best thing. That is until it started smelling of Mildew a month later. The concept is great if you want to buy a new one every month.It is also hard to keep your baby warm, you can't get their body in water without it coming up to their ears."
5,The easiest way to give your baby a bath!!!,"I give this item many more stars than just 5. I went through 3 infant bath tubs and my son grew out of the fairly quickly. Now he is 3 1/2 months and using the safer bather is really the easiest way to give your child a bath. I first saw this bathing pillow when my friend was giving her daughter a bath and I fell in love with it even them, she is now 14 months and still uses it. I just put the safer bather in my big tub, and I have my hands free (not having to hold a slippery little one)."
3,bathtime by yourself,"I had a hard time giving the baby a bath by myself for a long time. I bought this and then my husband hurt his leg and couldn't help me. Now I'm a pro. I can do it now without the bather, but I still like to use it. My only problem with it is that I like to give my baby a bath every night (she loves it). It always seems to still be wet/cold from the night before and I have to go without it every other night. But for the most part this bather is pretty great."
2,Good....But Beware Moldy,"I have been using this bather for about 4 months now. I loved it at first. It made bathing baby very easy and she did not slip and slide all over the place. I bought a hook to hang on the wall so that I could hang it up and it would drain and dry properly. However, after about 4 months I started to notice that it was beginning to get small moldy spots. I located my ""instruction sheet"" that came with the bather and followed the washing instructions. No luck. The moldy spots were still there. I have decided not to use it any longer."
1,Used once and never again....,I can see that it would be comfortable but it was easier to bathe without this bulky item.... Would not suggest.
1,Waste of Money,"This product is a waste of money. It does not work the way you would expect. It becomes completely waterlogged and heavy. The baby lies flat and is not submersed in any water at all, leaving baby cold and uncomfortable. I am surprised at all the good reviews. The plain old mesh ""sling"" bath is better and costs less."
2,Safer Bather,"I am a new mother of a 3 week old boy. I was all excited when I got the Safer Bather until I used it a few times. I placed the bather ontop my sink counter for sponge baths,before his belly button fell off. It did keep him comfortable but I had to place a towel under it to catch the water. After I hung it in the shower to drain and dry it developed some black mold. I didn't want to bath him on it like that so I washed it.What a mistake! Now I can't use it anymore. I called the store and they said I could return it, which is great. I am just sticking with a regular baby tub now."
1,not impressed.....,"Bath pad did its job but by the time I got him undressed and on the pad the water it had sucked up had turned cold and it was horrible : ( I would recommend just sticking with a bathtub, in fact I am going to go buy one today! One thing I did like about the pad though was that it only took a few mins to dry after I hung it up."
1,not so great,"I bought this based on so many parents' reviews here. I should have listened to the negative ones instead of the raves. My son is now almost 5 months old and I'm going to have to buy another bath tub. Mildew is growing on this pad, despite having been washed in the washing machine and put outside to dry. This pad absorbs ALOT of water when in the tub, it gets really heavy and will leave a lake on your bathroom floor if you hang it to dry anywhere other than inside the tub/shower. This isn't practical to use inside a regular tub. I ended up using it on the bathroom counter most of the time."
2,This product STINKS - literally,"Follow the instructions to the letter - this product will still smell bad after a few uses. I HATE IT!!! I've gone through 3 bathing things so far - and this is my least favorite. First, it doesn't have much elevation for newborns. Second, it gets heavy once it's wet and flattens.Alternate product recommendation - Sure Comfort Tub by The First Years.... now THAT is a good baby bathtub!!!"
2,Mildew collector,"This product seemed OK at first, with a newborn in a kitchen sink with very little water. The picture above is deceiving, because it really is a FLAT pillow with very little concave (notice the baby in the picture is propped up; this is not how the pillow will lie in your sink/tub) so the baby's ears are often submerged in very little water. What's worse, is that in a matter of a few months, the pillow material is pilling/shredding, it smells, and it's covered in mildew. No amount of machine washing will get it clean... So, time to try something else!"
4,Great for the Interim,"My baby boy hated that hard plastic tub. His body was either too exposed to the cold or the water was filled up too high to be safe. This bath pad just lays in the tub and he is surprisingly happy when he's in it. I think he'll outgrow it by six months or so, but by that point he'll be sitting up. So it's great for that infant stage when they can't sit up yet."
2,Mildew! Yikes!,"I never write product reviews, but this was one product I had to comment on. I purchased the Safer Bather because my one month old hated the bath. His plastic tub was hard and he would tilt to the side. This seemed like the perfect solution...and it was, for about a month. Then the smell and the mildew started. No matter that I wrung the cushion out after his bath, and hung it to dry completely between uses, it continued to mildew. When I washed it, it completely lost its shape. My son is now six months old, and I haven't used it in months. Also, after buying this product and liking it (at the time), I then ordered another product from the Leachco Inc. Catalogue (which came in the package). That product (a ""lightly"" vibrating sleep positioner) did not work at all! I now believe that Leachco products are a complete waste of money! I hope this review helps :)"
5,Safer Bather Best for Baby Bathing,"This is by far the most comfortable item ever invented for baby.Baby doesn't slip, baby is comfortable, baby enjoys bathing and more importantly, mom feels at ease knowing that her baby is safe while she bends to pick up the towel or reaches over for the baby soap. The baby doesn't move or wiggle around and kudos to whoever invented this product."
2,Not so usable in the tub,"We found this wasn't the best thing to use in the bath regularly. It's a bit of work to wring the water out, and you never get it all out. It takes over a day to dry, which means if you use it daily you can expect mold/mildew.We did find it useful around the house outside the tub. If you ever need to lay your baby down somewhere secure and don't have time to prep it, this bath pad makes a handy pad that keeps your child in position."
2,Not as I expected,"I got the safe bather for my 3 month-old baby. It was good at first, but now that he is 5 months, that bather stinks! Every time I bathe my baby, I squize the water out of it and I hang it on the shower. I have washed it several times, but it has come to a point that the smell won't go away!I now put a towel on top of it, so it won't stink that bad, however my son is starting to sit on his own, so bath time is becoming easier!"
3,"love the tub, but it got moldy","I did love this tub. I have used it for about 8 weeks and my baby loves getting baths. He is about 10 wks old now and I have noticed little bits of mold growing on the tub. I rinsed it after each use and hung it to dry. It might have gotten moldy bec I hung it to dry in the bathroom, and my husband and I take showers in this bathroom. I am very disappointed about the mold bec I really like the tub a lot. I threw it in the wash machine but the mold is still there."
2,Soft but Smelly,We bought this for our infant son because it looked like the most comfortable baby bath on the market. It absorbs the warm water which our baby liked but when you hang it up to dry it molds before it dries. We squeezed out the excess water (as the directions recommend) and hung it in a dry room to air out. The next day it smelled of mildew. And each time we used it we had to wash it in the washing machine to get the smell out---WAY too much work. Go for a plastic tub.
2,Mildews easily,"I loved the idea of this, and it did seem cozy for my son, but, it mildewed after one month of use, despite rinsing and squeezing it out. I later washed it the washer, and now it has lost it shape and thickness, and still smells funny. Too bad, because I like the idea of a pillow-like surface to keep him from slipping around in the tub."
5,Great Product!!,I originally had another bather on my registry until i read all the bad reviews and decided not to get that one. Which is how I found this one!! this is definitely the bather you want to have for a newborn!! We put this pillow right into our kitchen sink (single basin) and it fits perfectly! It soaks up the warm water and our 1 month old son loves it he hasn't cried yet and he stays warm and doesnt slide everywhere! Afterwards we prop it up in the sink and the water quickly drains out of it and then we hang it in the shower! really easy!!
2,...,This Safer Bather was a waste!... Even more so it wore horribly! When I called the company I got no were! I got an email stating that they only guarantee there product for 30 days. Mine tore after 3 months of use and they could care less! They were rude and very unfriendly! I say take your business elsewhere!
1,How is this safe?,really not ideal for safety. It's flat and goes on the bottom of the tub. I don't like it- maybe it works for other but not me.
4,It was a good product,"i just purchased this product and I was using the comments used by the good cutomers at Amazon.com. They said that their kids liked it, and that they wouldn't be that fussy. My son does like it somewhat, but I really don't feel it holding the warm water and sometimes the mat slips in the sink. Do I recommend this product? If you don't want to purchase an infant tub, then yes, otherwise, look around and then decide."
2,Smells of Mildew!,It worked good for support in the baby tub when I had to sponge bathe her. Other then that I dont see too many uses for it. I only used it twice and now it reaks of mildew. I made sure to ring it after every use and hang it. I just hope they will still let me return it.
2,I dont like at all,"works for bath with towels early days, but to bathe a baby in a tub is unsanitary, the fabric is lint."
3,Nice but not very soft,"Great if you plan to bathe your baby in the regular tub (or a big portable tub, although I haven't managed to find one that fits), but be warned : the fabric isn't soft at all ! Our baby hates it so we have to use a towel between her and the pad : not very handy..."
3,Not mildew resistent,"My son loves this safe bather but it is not mildew resistent as stated. I would hang it to dry after use but after several baths, the mildew stains began to form.That is my only complaint."
5,A Life saver for my little wiggler,"At first i used a padded little tub for my now 3 1/2 months old and she grew out of it and couldnt kick and splash, then i tried the little seats that she can lay on but she would slip out of it. Then i found this and it is Perfect! she can kick and splash away and stay secure. She wont slip out no matter how vigerous her kicking gets and its comfprtable for her. A bath time essential!"
3,Safer Bather review,I was given the safer bather as a present for my baby shower and though it is convenient and portable it does mildew even when you do hang it to dry in a well ventilated area. I even washed it and dry in the machines and it still mildews. So my suggestion is start with this item but eventually graduated to something better i.e. plastic.Jackie
4,My son loves it....,"The only reason I give the bath pillow less than 5 stars is because I would have liked a little more padding in the headrest. I still have trouble keeping the water out of his ears. Otherwise, it has been fantastic. My 4 mth old son is SO comfortable during bathtime and just last week he fell asleep during his bath!!!!I simply lay the pillow in our big tub and just fill with a few inches of water and my son can spread out and not be cramped for space.The hanging hook is a great idea as well. I just hang it on the shower nozzle to dry in between baths. I've been very pleased with this product and would readily recommend it to other moms."
5,DON'T BUY ANOTHER TUB,"I can't believe how inexpensive this PERFECT tub is for my baby. I fumbled around with all of the big plastic tubs with my 1st child but his one is a god send for my 2nd! It's like one big sponge that I lay in the bathroom tub. It absorbs the water and as soon as you pick it up, 95% of the water just falls out! No need to worry about it molding or taking forever to dry. It dries out completely in just a couple of hours (and is also machine washable). You can store this just about anywhere unlike the big plastic space hogs. Also, beware of the plastic tubs with the rubber linings (so called anti slip mats) which can rub the babies back the wrong way. My daughter lost some skin on her back from squirming around in one of those and it was sore for days! Buy this safer bather!"
1,Returning after just one use!!,I purchased this because the store was out of the tub I wanted and this was my second choice. I should have just waited. The first time I used it I followed all the directions about what soap you shouldn't use and washing and drying instructions. The first time I used it I placed it inside my infant tub and when through rung out the water and hung it to dry. The next morning there was a black ring that looked like mildew where the water had dried. So I washed it following all the directions. It is now all lumpy and the fabris is pulled in one spot and could break open. I am very unhappy with this and hopefully will be able to return it. I would not recommend this to anyone. I'll just roll up a towel to keep my newborn's head from wobbling.
2,Hard to use,"This bather seemed safe and easy. However, I thought it was kind of dangerous for two reasons. One - It was dangerous for me to carry my newborn daughter in and out of our huge tub to put her in the bather. Two - This thing slides all over the place in the tub. It also didn't fit in my sink! Another hassel was having to strain the water out of it and hanging it to dry. We used it twice before we threw it away."
2,Too big for a baby bathtub...,"We bought this from a local Babies R Us store to use in our baby bathtub. We had been putting a towel in the tub to keep our 2 month old from sliding down inside the tub.Once we put this Safer Bather in there, our baby could barely fit! It kept him so far out of the water that he was getting cold. Also, the Safer Bather itself got extemely cold once it was wet and exposed to the air.I may be wrong about how to use this thing - we haven't tried it in the adult bathtub yet, but I really can't imagine how it would work in there.Save your money and just use a towel in the baby's bathtub until your baby is old enough to fit in it properly."
2,Pointless,"First of all, it was too big for my kitchen sink so I didn't use it until my son was about 6 months old and could bathe him in the tub. By that time my son was able to roll over and crawled his cute little butt right out of it. So I never really got to use it, nor did I need to use it. It's just a big piece of junk that I don't really know where to keep. If you like the idea of this item I at least suggest buying one of those inflatable tubs, that way it will be out of the way when not in use. Otherwise, I think that you could do without it."
1,Forget it!,I don't get this tub. It fills with water making it heavy and water laden. It doesn't prop the baby up enough to prevent water getting in the ears. Its a waste of time. Try the fold up tub offered via Babies R US from First Safety.
5,Worth its' weight in gold!,"This is an amazing product. I use this with the Infant to Toddler Bath by Evenflo and the combo works great. The baby is comfortable and doesn't slip around. Holds up nicely, baby is so comfortable. I used this product until my baby was able to sit up. I have another one on the way, and am going to use this all over again with her. A must have; I highly recommend."
5,Soft and Safe,"I absolutely love this bather. It is soft enough and easy enough to use in the tub as soon as baby loses his umbilical cord. We never had to transition our 7 month old into the big tub. We went right from the sponge bath to this. It is soft and easy enough to use right away. I like the way it absorbs the water so my little one stays warm. Now that he is sitting up, he can pull up and still sit on the bather. It is also soft so that it he slips, he has a cushion. I like how this bather will be used for a long time, with no need to buy transitional bathers."
4,Great bath item!,I love this pad. It's perfect for keeping my little one in place while bathing. My favorite feature is the handle so I can hang dry. Wish I would have found this for my first baby.
5,Great Bather!,"Love this bather! I have very old kitchen with a small double sink. We tried the hard tub but it was way to complicated at first and dangerous! So I bought this and what a difference! I was able to bathe my son on the counter, with a rag, no mess and he wasnt cold (like he was in the plastic tub). Once he became 5 months or so we transferred over to the plastic tub. You do have to make sure to thoroughly ring out the cushion and leave the bathroom door open while it is airing out so no mildew forms....it worked great for us and now purchasing another for my second :)"
5,Wonderful! Very Pleased.,"We ordered this before our son was born (he is now two months old) and I am overjoyed with this bathtub solution. We have used it both in the sink and the bathtub. Due to the size you do need a larger sink. It has worked perfectly- it cradles the baby while still allowing the water to surround him or her. It does absorb water during the bath which must be drained out of it but it is so comfy and there is nothing hard or slippery which was important to me because wet babies are slippery enough. I also like that you could use this to give a sponge bath before the cord falls off. Lastly, I love that it is made in America."
4,Great for a newborn,"We have just given our 3 week old two baths and the Safer Bather is great for this age. I love that it pulls the warm water from the sink up against her little bottom and as long as you pour warm water over the baby occasionally (which you should be doing anyway so they won't freeze), the whole cushion stays comfy for the duration of the bath. I love that this cushion supports her so well and that it's not the least bit slippery. I can prop her up on this and only need one hand to hold her in place. I've got my other hand free to grab bath gear as I need it. I'm giving this as a gift."
2,I like my newborn to toddler tub better,"I bought this because it looked like a more comfortable version of the tub sponge that my mom recommended. It does elevate the baby more than the yellow sponge, but I had a few things I didn't like about it. First, it is very hard to lift to wring out after the bath. The water it soaks up makes it very heavy. Second, if you don't have all of the water wrung out of it, and don't completely submerge it into the warm water at the next bath, when the baby lays on it some of the cold water comes out and makes the baby cold. For the longest time I couldn't figure out why my son screamed every time I laid him on the Safer Bather, and then one day I felt the cold water coming up out of it as I was bathing him. I switched to the Sure Comfort newborn to toddler tub and he likes it so much better. He prefers to be IN the warm water rather than on top of it."
5,Love it!,"I tried 2 different infant tubs before buying the Safer Bather, and wish I had saved my money. I have a large kitchen sink that I can bathe my baby in, and the Safer Bather is great for that. My son, now 7 months old, is getting big enough to sit up during his bath, and I still use the Safer Bather to cushion his little bottom. Whenever possible, I hang it outside to dry, because I think it dries faster and stays fresher that way. It does occasionally get a little smelly, so I just put in the washer with a little bleach and it's as good as new."
5,Greater Bather!,I use this when i bath my dd by myself- it's great! No worries about sinking baby!! I do recommend getting in the tub with LO so as to keep a better hand on them! But my dd would stay in this forever (that is if we would have unlimited hot water and no worries of wrinkly feet)! It's great to watch her start splashing and kicking!! Highly recommended!!
4,Great Product,"I was having trouble finding a comfortable bath for my 4 month old, this works great!! She can lay on this in our bathtub comfortably & she loves to splash around..excellent buy!!!!"
2,"NOT Mildew-Resistant, and Fabric Pills","I've been using this since mid-Sept 2002, and my baby loves it. However, I've recently noticed a mildew odor, and the fabric is pilling. I hang it to dry in a well-ventilated room after each bath, so I'm clueless as to why there is a mildew problem. I've tried washing it by hand, too. That seemed to help a little, but it did not eliminate the odor. I've contacted Leachco to see if they have any suggestions, as these problems are contradictory to the corporate product description. These problems aside, it's a great product."
4,The good and the bad...,"My baby loves it. It did seem to submerge him in the water a little more than the plastic tub we got as a shower gift, but not a lot more. I couldn't use as much water as I liked because it would get in the baby's ears(unlike in the pic, where the kid's head is way up out of the water).Also, I made it a point to ring it out and hang it up after every use, but after a couple weeks of use, it is starting to stink a little bit...I have not tried to wash it yet to see if the smell goes away.Also if your baby kicks a lot, like mine, you have to be very careful because he can almost scoot himself off of it."
2,Jaimemom24,"I really do like the product, however it did mildew (the tag says it won't). I am having to throw it out after having it for 2 months. It just keeps getting mildew spots no matter what I do!"
1,Not as great as expected,"My 4 month old daughter lifts her legs & butt up so that she slides down on the cushion thus submerging her ears in the water - about 2 inches of water in the tub. Even with us being right there I don't think this is a very safe item. It also smells sour and has since the 3rd use, in spite of being rinsed & dried after every bath."
4,Great Asset to Have,We decided to register for this for our baby instead of getting a baby bathtub (no room). It has worked very well. It dries out quite nicely when you're finished with it and I just washed it in the washing machine for the first time in three months-it hadn't needed it until now. We keep it hanging in the shower-that works great. One tip-don't wash it with anything else (like a bathmat) it attracts lint like a magnet! Overall a great buy for less money.
4,All we've used,"We really like this. Once her umbilical cord fell off, this is all we've bathed her in. I think it keeps her feeling warm and secure. I didn't give it 5 stars because I've had problems with a mildew like smell even though I hang it up and it dries. So when I notice the smell,I soak it in the tub with Dreft detergent."
5,Baby LOVES this new bath!,Our daughter outgrew her infant tub pretty quickly and still can't sit up so this works perfectl! We'll use it from the beginning with #2! She's longer than the insert - but that just means her feet are free to kick and splash. She loves it and bathtime is a blast now.
4,Pretty cool,"I found that the idea of this bather was excellent. Sadly, it did not fit in my sink. I ended up using it as a cushion on the counter to dress her in. I do not bath my baby without it."
4,This is great!,"I love this product. I bought it for my 6 month old to be able to take a bath with her 3 year old sister. She can sit up in it so easily and to wash her hair, I just lay her down and the raised back keeps her head above water. I only gave it 4 stars because it already smells like it needs to be washed and I haven't had it that long. But other than that, I really love it."
5,The best bath item.,This is by far the best bath item that I have used for my children. I had a hard time finding a new one and had to resort to trying different products and it showed me even more how great the Safer Bather is.
5,Great for giving baby a bath..,"I really love this product. I would recommend buying this instead of a baby tub, bath sponge, or bath lounge. I have the bath sponge shaped like a teddy bear and she is only three months and has almost out grown it, we use it as a cushion on the counter instead of in the bath tub. This bath product is great for her size. I will definitely be purchasing another one or two."
4,A goodie!,"We found the Safer Bather after becoming frustrated with our plastic baby tub, and all of its discomforts - - what a nice change this is. The pad is super-thick and soft, and our big 4 month old boy can still fit in here comfortably. It does a great job keeping his little head elevated, but still keeps him in the water and warm during bath time. My only disappointment is that it really is too large for the double sinks in our kitchen, but in the full-size bathtub, it really is a good thing."
5,A must have for newborns,"Our son is 5 weeks old and I don't know what I would do without this! Coming home from the hospital, I was petrified to give him a bath. But this product saved me. It's soft and comfortable for him and keeps him warm. And it gives great support for me... no slipping! So much better than putting your baby in a plastic tub! I will buy this for all my friends having babies."
5,Perfect for babies!,"I did not want one of those big, bulky, hard plastic bathtubs for my little girl, so when I saw the Safer Bather I immediatly registered for it. My daughter has been bathing on it since we brought her home from the hospital and now that she is 3 months old she loves to splash in it! It is so simple to use - just hang it up to dry when your done. I usually just leave it hanging in the bathtub until the next bath, but it can be easily stored anywhere."
5,Great bathing system,"I really like this product. It is wonderful for the tiniest baby in the sink because it really sucks up water and keeps the baby warm. It is nice in the tub as they get bigger, too. I have a confession: When the Safer Bather is dry, I use it to cradle my baby on the floor when I am using the restroom and washing my hands. One tip I have is to squeeze it out some before you hang it up to dry because it is VERY heavy when filled with water. For fifteen bucks, this product is a great gadget to have around."
4,After three other bathtubs this is the one!,"I went through many different bathtubs for my baby girl. I had a safety first tub that folded, a wire frame tub with a cloth cover that made it more like a lawnchair, a non-folding tub by safety first and then I finally broke down and tried this tub.I hated how all the others allowed my daughter to slide around and even slip down and turn sideways while bathing. This bath sponge tub is great. She does not slip slide around, I can wash her entire body much easier, and when the tub is filled properly she is nice and warm. She loves to kick and splash with her feet while in the other tubs she would squirm and start to cry.If the sponge tub starts to smell after awhile (mine did after 3 months) try to put it in the washer and then hang it in a well ventillated area. That is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 - it did smell alittle mildewy recently but now after being washed it is fine.Lets just say the other three tubs are going in the lawn sale this summer!"
3,Good buy,I bought this tub for my son when he was first born. It worked great for about 2 months. But then the foam on the inside started to loose its shape. It started to get flat. But we could still use it even after it flattened out some.
5,LOVE THIS,"After my daughter outgrew the 4 Stages bath tub by First Years (she was too long at 2 and 3/4 mos and was hurting her feet by kicking the hard plastic edge)I purchased the Safer Bather. I love it and she loves it. I use it inside of a small inflatable tub (so I don't have to fill the whole bathtub with water). It is soft and she seems very comfortable in it. Now when she kicks the water she may hit the soft inflatable tub which won't hurt. The Safer Bather would be great for a newborn too as baby can recline back it it! If you just wring it out a little and hang it on the hanger that comes with it, it dries out completely each time. LOVE THIS!"
5,Best baby bathing option out there!,"We got this for my daughter when she was about six weeks old when I didn't like either of the two hard plastic tubs that we had. I wish we would have had this from the beginning, it is great! I find it much easier to use and store than the hard plastic options.I have been using it every day for about 8 weeks now and have not had any problems with it getting musty. I have run it through the wash with bleach once to sanitize it and a couple times I have run it on the spin cycle when I want to dry it out quickly, but most days I just squeeze out the excess water and hang it in the shower with the curtain open and it will be dry by morning."
3,Comfortable but GETS HEAVY!,"We got the safer bather because I just didn't want another hunk of plastic laying around the house and this was more like a soft pillow. Our baby seems very comfortable in it at bath time and when she was very small, I used to put her in it to change her diapers.The only down-side so far is that while submerged in water, it absorbs a lot of water. While this is great because it keeps the baby nice and warm, it is SO difficult to wring-out afterwards. And it gets SO HEAVY!!! I usually have my husband do it and then we have to hang it in the shower for at least a day to drip-dry."
2,Definitely not mildew proof,"I bought this product for my 5 mo old baby b/c she had outgrown her baby tub but not quite ready to sit up in the tub. I did a lot of research and this product claims to be mildew resistant but not mildew proof. If you live anywhere that it is humid, do not buy this product--it will mildew after just one use even if you rinse it out and wring it out real well. It does provide comfy cushioning for baby in the tub, but unless you want to throw it in the dryer after every wash, you might want to look elsewhere."
5,The best for newborns,"I used this for my daughter's first bath and 3 months later I'm still using it. Everyone told me how nerve racking it was to bath a slippery wet infant, but with this safer bather and my kitchen sink we've had nothing but smooth sailing. She loves her bath everytime thanks to this bather.It fits snuggly into the kitchen sink and I can sit her up or lay her down to clean and play with her. It also fits into our baby bath tub, and every other thing we use to bath her. As long as you take care to rinse it off with cool water after each use and let it hang dry it will last through every bath. It's comfortable and safe, the perfect way to feel calm and relaxed during those first few baths when you're a little nervous."
5,The Most Important Baby Item You'll Ever Buy!,"This is my standard shower gift for friends. I used one of those awful plastic, hard, cold tubs for a few weeks before being told about this safer bather. It supports babies head, keeps the baby warmer because it absorbs the heat from the water and makes bathing a breeze. My daughter is now 14 months old and we still use it! An absolute must have as far as I'm concerned."
2,"Great idea, needs improvement","Good idea that needs improving. Cushions baby well & holds head up to avoid watery ears, but a bit scratchy & pills easily. Doesn't drain& dry well, although wrung & hung up immediately. Worse, though washed often, mildews; you don't want your child to touch or breathe that. Contacted co. about mildewing easily, despite claim of resistancy. Response: it is mildew RESISTANT, not mildew PROOF, & to wash in my washer. DUH! Had issues with Leacho products & although they respond & have good product ideas, the quality is lacking. They should heed our comments."
3,An item I didn't end up using much,"This was one of those ""I've got to have it"" items that was on my registry. I used it a few times and then that was it. It does work well at cushioning, but I found that my son wasn't immersed enough in the water and would start to get cold as did the water that collected on top of the cushion.I also got the Evenflo Infant to Toddler bath that has the built in (removable) inclined, cushioned insert that worked quite well instead. With the insert removed, the cushion made a perfect fit, I just found that I preferred the bathtub insert more."
