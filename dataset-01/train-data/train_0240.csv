4,Moving and inspirational,"This is the autobiography of an American-born child of Irish immigrants who return to their roots and poverty in Ireland. Young Frankie's father suffers from 'the drink,' while his mother suffers from depression and often neglects her children. They are malnourished and live in squalid conditions. Too proud to accept charity, Frankie's father drinks away what little money he manages to earn.Reading allows the young boy to escape to other worlds. Through books, Frank develops his survival skills and a sense of hope for a better future. This strengthens his determination to earn enough money to return to America one day. McCourt's ability to illustrate the humor in his tragic childhood is very inspirational, albeit bittersweet.This book should be required reading for all teenagers. The McCourt saga continues in the sequal 'Tis."
4,Captivating Memoir,"Frank McCourt tells the poignant, touching story of his childhood in Ireland. He was from a poor family and his father was a drunkard. While he did not have an easy childhood, he never let go of the dream to make something better of himself and provide a better life for his mother. McCourt's way of writing is exactly like he's telling a story and I had to get used to reading like I was listening to a storyteller. It takes some getting used to, but once you do, you can practically hear his accent."
5,Awesome,"I couldn't put this book down. Frank McCourt's writing style is unique. The book is funny and sad, stays with you for days after. I had to get the next two books and am now trying to stretch out the 3rd book because I don't want it to end."
2,"A compelling story, but I found the writing style laborious","I may be nitpicking, but did anyone else find it difficult to distinguish between the dialogue and the narrative? Can we please return to using quotation marks! A compelling story of poverty, but not a page-turner. A good book for those with lots of free time."
2,Is the acclaim to blame?...,"Frank McCourt's relentless catalogue of the horrors of hisupbringing, while accurate in his case, were not typical ofthe vast majority of Irish poor of that time. His familylife was an extreme - his father was an extreme - the deathof three siblings was an extreme. McCourt does a wonderfuljob portraying his mother's courage and in showing thepsychic baggage the Irish Catholic poor are lumbered with.But this is a mightily flawed book and the acclaim it isreceiving astounds me. The child's point of view is finallytedious and wears us down; the pathos is well-worn andtired; the book lacks any lyricism. This is a still-bornbook and McCourt should try again to give us the book thatall the critics are raving about."
5,This book is good for the Soul,"The heart of this book is the character of McCourt's longsuffering mother, Angela. I love her response to her sons when they whine (often with good reason, given the extent of their poverty): ""I'm sorry for your troubles,"" Angela says. She teaches her sons to weather the storms of life, for she has certainly weathered a few of her own- an alcoholic husband who cannot pay the bills, the deaths of her young children, the humiliation of begging the Catholic Church for charity to sustain her family. Angela was a saint, and McCourt has written this loving story in honor of his mother.I had heard so many good things about this book that I was actually reluctant to read it. I thought that it could not measure up to the reviews- but it did. McCourt's prose reads like poetry. I encourage the reader to first listen to the CD of McCourt reading Angela's Ashes with his Irish tongue. Also, the movie is NOT a disappointment, and is a ""must see"" for those who loved the book."
2,I found this book very depressing and redundant.,I realize that life of the Irish Catholic boy was difficult but how many times can you talk about the abusive alocholic father. After awhile every chapter sounded exactly the same. It was hard to even care what happened next.The Color of Water was much better. It achieved what this book could not.
2,Okay already!,"Just one example of why there are so many different books in the world and so many different people. Someone is bound to like each particular book but I am not one of them for Angela's Ashes.Yes, I know Frank's family was poor. Yes, I know Frank's dad was a drunk. Did I have to read it on every single page?"
5,letter to frank,i really love your autotap and can you tell me your new book comeing out if thre is goning to be a autotap with that one to jenny
2,Disappointing,"After having heard so much about the book, I was disappointed when I read it. Although I empathize with the characters, I did not feel that the writing in a literary sense was anything remarkable - I am surprised it won the Pulitzer! I felt sorry for the suffering of the author and the family but having grown up in a third-world country in Asia, I could not help but think of countless similar children and families who experience the same suffering but have not even a hope or dream of ever being able to go to America to improve their lot in life. A tolerable book but too much hype."
2,Depressing and all too accurate view of the Irish,"Found the book an all too accurate portrayal of a certain kind of all too prevalent type of craven, selfish Irishman....terribly depressing because of this. And now, with McCord shilling for Barnes & Noble and showing arrogant contempt for the independent booksellers of America, who helped push the book to superstardom, I can see that he is not a lot different, despite making his way in the United States.....he plans to ""throw their letter in the trash unopened."" Not a book, or a man, that, if you are honest about your Irish background, you are proud to read or know. T. Hannagan, noahbear@worldnet.att.net"
1,Awful Book,"Do not buy this book. That is unless, of course, you enjoy books that have no story and shallow, annoying, pathetic characters. Then again, you may take pleasure in immersing yourself in 400 pages of depression, poverty, woe, alcoholism, misery and child abuse. I could only stomach 40 pages before I realized that the ENTIRE book was going to be like an extended, nightmarish trip to the dentist. I kept waiting for the voice to change and for the story to actually BEGIN. Neither happen. Do yourself a favor and find something else to read.Angela's Ashes is nothing more than a poorly-written, self-indulgent pity party."
1,"UNBELIEVABLE , TRULY UNBELIEVABLE","I AGREE WITH DIANE SCHIRF , THIS IS A REAL WORK OF FICTION. ITS AN INSULT TO THE POOR, THE IRISH, TO REAL MOTHERS EVERYWHERE, AND TO THE READER WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE ALL THIS GUFF. ITS LIKE A COMPILATION OF ALL THE WORST HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN THE WORLD, EXCEPT FOR THE SUBJECT WHO OBVIOUSLY IS A BABE MAGNET AND PHYSICAL WONDER FOR SURVIVING. FIRST I WAS ANGRY AND WANTED TO THROW IT AGAINST THE WALL , BUT THEN IT BECAME RIDICULOUS AND COMICAL.I KEPT READING IT ONLY BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT HAD TO GET BETTER, P PRIZE AND ALL. I GUESS HIS IMAGINATION WAS NOT STARVED. HOW MANY WOMEN SWAM OUT TO MEET THE BOAT ????"
1,Bad,"I don't know why everyone likes this book so much, I find it very boring, dull, never goes anywhere. It's about as much fun as molasses. In fact I would rather rip out my colon and skip rope with it then read another word. :-)"
4,how did he survive it?,"This memoire of a poverty striken and chaotic childhood in Ireland is brutally honest and sad. WHile I believe that it has been over-praised a bit, it has a distinctive writing style that is very enjoyable. There are many details that stick in the mind: his discovery that his mother begged in secret, the smell of the sewer next to their aprtment, their dog eating the only bit of meat in the house before they could grab it. Well worth the read."
4,Gritty and brutally honest,Frank McCourt's portrayal of his childhood spent in poverty left me with many vivid images:Two small boys picking up coal from the road to boil their charity pigs head for Christmas dinner; A distraught grandmother dragging a five year old boy off to the priest for confession because he &quot;thrun up the body and blood of Jesus&quot; into her backyard after his first communion.I was especially impresssed with the realism and humour of the dialogue.I look forward to reading the sequel when its written.
4,An Exellent Downer,"This is one of the most beautifully written memoir's I have ever read. It is hard to say this about the book as a critique, but it is almost too sad. The reason I hesitate to say that is because its a true story. If you are feeling down, do not read this book... find something lighter... but if you feel deep and intellectual, wanting to discover a deeper meaning of what it is to be human... DIVE IN!"
4,Stick with it!,I almost put this book down numerous times during the first 200 or so pages. It was so depressing I could hardly make myself read it. But it is a wonderful book and even becomes quite funny the farther you read along. It's worth the effort.
3,Sure an' its a good book....,"I read it. In a day, 's matter a' fact. I've wanted to for some time now, saw it on a chair at my niece's, sat in the chair, opened the cover and I didn't get up until I was done. There are many things that stick in my mind. His first pint and the way those in the pub raised their glasses, fully aware of the gravity of the act; when I read about the time he slept in his grandmother's black dress, I put the book down ('s too hard to read when you're laughing like I was...). Ah yeah, there's a lot in it and its all good. If asked if its a good book, I'd stop, think, then say, ""'Tis."""
3,Angela's Ashes,"This is very sad, poignant and loving account of poverty in Ireland of the early 1900s and a honest depiction of both God's intervention, human weakness and moral depravity."
5,Angela's Ashes were shoveled into my heart,"After finishing Frank McCourt's masterpiece I could hardly start another book. What could ever compare? Who would ever speak to me so honestly and sweetly? Angela's ashes were shoveled into my heart. I will never get the picture of Angela, staring into the ashes, unable to save her life or the lives of her children out of my mind. Being of Irish ancestry, this story touched me as no other probably could have. I personally recognized so many of the sayings, ways, and behaviors of the Irish. I felt shame at the way the McCourts treated their children and at the way their Irish neighbors turned their cruel backs to each other. I did, however find hope in the few individuals who saw intelligence and sparkle in the little boy who stood before them starving and ugly. They gave him the best advice they ever could have: Get yourself to America, Frank. And he did, thank Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph."
4,part 3 of 3,This is my third and final comment :)I have finally reached the end of the book. It took longer than I anticipated. The story wasn't what kept me going but the writing - excellent.
5,"Excellent, could not put it down",Just a big thank you to Mr. Mc Court for sharing his story. All I can say is read it.
5,Fantastic!,"One of the best books I have ever read. I'm encouraging my granddaughter to read it this very day. Focus on the poverty doesn't do it justice. The description of his early life is vivid and compelling. It's the courage and the will to survive, nay achieve, that keeps one reading to the very end, and panting for the sequel."
3,So what happened then?,"I love the kind of a book that when I finish reading it, I will hold it in my hands for a while, close my eyes, & relive its most memorable parts. I think I never really closed this one. Being an aduld, one would think that one can be satisfied with what was already told. A relatively good ending was incomplete for my taste - I needed to know what happened with the rest of the family - and I feel that I was left hanging in the wind and with no other option than to buy the sequel rather than to move on to happier subjects (for a change). The book in general was quite good, even though repetitive at times. It was not as tragic as it sounded in other reviews; it was incredibly sad at times, but not terrible where one would choose not to reach for this book. Venture out but keep in mind that if you need closure, it is not there."
3,A slow start,"I read this book for school. If I had read it on my own, I don't think I would have finished it. The beginning was a little to slow for me, and it also took a while for me to understand the narative of it. It is not written normally with quotes, ect, it is written in free verse, unlike anything else I have read. Once Frank becomes older, he starts to lead an interesting life, where he is woken up to all of socitys wrongs. Personally I think this almost always interesting. From that point on, I enjoyed it. Overall, if I knew the entire plot, I would read it, but if it was as borring as the first 75 pages, I would not have."
5,best book I have ever read,"I have read many many books but Angela's Ashes is without a doubt the most enjoyable. It is wonderfully written: you hear the child's Irish voice almost as though he was in the same room having a conversation with you. I was laughing , then crying all the way through the book. The honesty is the most touching thing of all. I was so moved by this book that I don't actually have adequate words to express my feelings."
5,Trust Me,"I was loaned this book by a friend. He told me just to ""trust him"" and read it. I was hesitant and wasn't sure if I would like this book, but now you can ""trust me"". If you have any interest at all in Ireland, culture, sociology, or that particular time period you will love this insightful memoir. This book will stay with you, and after only a dozen pages you will be hooked and unable to put it down."
5,A great story of the human spirit.,"This book is a testimony of human survivability under the most horrid impoverished situations. It shows what the God given soul can overcome. I loved this book and am awaiting the release of ""tis"""
5,"REPEAT AFTER ME- MEMOIR (not a novel, folks)","I've already given my review of this book, but I must add that this is Frank McCourt's LIFE, not just another novel. For those who say this book is depressing, I think it might do you some good to find a slum in your city and walk around a bit. Mr. McCourt has done an amazing thing by bringing his chilhood to print for all of us to experience through his words. It would also do you a bit of good to reflect on your life, where you came from, what was handed to you, what you really had to work for. Frank McCourt has truly lived a life that he made from nothing. I look forward to ""'Tis"", and hope that those of you who have a hard time with depression and poverty never get thrown out of your house or high-rise. Won't you be shocked."
5,"Angela's Ashes, best audio book ever","The book is great, it won a Pulitizer. But the audio book is incredible. Frank McCourt inhabits the characters of everyone who speaks, including himself at 3, 5, 9, and on. He sings every song, reads poetry, plays priests, librarians, his brothers, his teachers ... even Americans and Englishmen. I've heard it twice, and I can't wait to hear it again."
3,Angela's Ashes,"My book is called Angela's Ashes. Its written by Frank McCourt. The main characters of the book are Aunt Aggie, Grandma, Alpie McCourt, Malachy McCourt, Michael McCourt, and Frank McCourt. The story takes place in the 1940's. TheMcCourt's live in Limerick, Ireland in a beat up old house on Roden Lane. The story is about Frank McCourt living in a poor family. All he wants to do it make it to America. If I could of wrote one line it would have bee this,""A mothers love is a blessing no matter where you roam keep her while you have her, you'll miss her whe she is gone."" page 357 The cover is a picture of a little poor boy. I think that the little boy represents Frank McCourt. I think that the title of this book represents Angels and how when she look at the fire there is never anything there but ashes. On a scale 1 to I would rate this boof a 5. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because it is very sad and it wasn't something that really sparked my interest."
5,Wonderful,"I stayed away from this book for many years because I thought it would too sad. Boy was I wrong.This is a wonderful book. A lesser writer would make this story depressing. Its hard to imagine poorer conditions in which to spend ones childhood. Yet in the hand of this master storyteller, events that would be depressing become colorful and amusing. I found the book so engaging I did not want to put it down.After finishing this book I immediately read Tis, which begins where this story leaves off. You probably will too!"
2,If You Like a Little Fiction with Your Hyperbole....,"Mr McCourt was the unfortunate victim of a disease - his father's alcoholism - and not that fate worse than death, an Irish Catholic childhood.His story strains credibility;moreover, he perpetuates negative stereotypes. I loved his verbal agility and hated his manipulation of the reader"
2,How awful,"I was so sick and tired of the ""can't do,"" ""oh woe is me"" attitude of Angela and her drunken husband that I wanted to shake them both. How could anyone call him/herself a parent and neglect those poor children so badly. I found it depressing in the extreme and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
5,I can't wait for the sequal!,this book was non-stop. What makes it so good is that it really happened. I really recomend this book.
5,Enlightening and inspiring,"Angela's Ashes effected me by changing my outlook on life. Frank McCourt's stories of surviving extreme poverty, and overcoming cruelty from extended family members and many others, are inspiring. Even more amazing is the fact that he had the strength and discipline to write down the memories of his bleak upbringing. This should be required reading for any member of ""Generation X"" or any overindulged teenager who dares to complain about life. A co-worker loaned me the book, but I am buying my own copy because I never want to forget some of the people Frank described. I did find the ending abrupt, however, and I want to know more about his life, and his family. A sequel, please!"
5,This book was truly amazing...,"I read this book and found myself wanting more at the end. Frank McCourt told a depressing and dreary tale of his early life in Ireland with a wry wit, but also so vividly that you felt you were along for the ride to experience his miserable childhood."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"Angela's Ashes is one of the most riveting books I have read in a very long time. It is amazing that Frank McCort survived his childhood, much less to have become such a brilliant writer. As a kindergarten teacher, I found the narrative from the young child's point of view to be incredibly accurate. I hope there will be a sequel soon!"
2,"Much Overrated, Bordering on the Ridiculous","Here's a book which, if it wasn't claimed to be a memoir, would be universally put down as a collection of all the usual trite stereotypes of Irish people and Irish-Americans -- the drunken, maudlin father who spouts off at the drop of a hat about the IRA, the long-suffering mother with multiple children who beats her breast at her husband's drinking, the religious and overbearing aunts, etc. etc. Then there is a supporting cast of stereotypical Jewish mothers, and Italian grocers, and, well you get the picture.The author shows a wee a bit of humor (which is why 2 stars rather than one), but spends most of his time wallowing in self-pity. The writing is an example of mawkish excess. No memorable images to speak of -- Irish men get drunk at funerals, women act catty toward each other, bureaucrats show indifference.You will read this book, and then not remember a thing about it a week later."
3,Good and original but gets repetitive after 1st half,"This book is interesting because the tone is original, and there is humour, and also because of the circumstances at the time.One the reader has digested this there is still about halfway to go, and the second half makes for much less fun, original, interesting reading.Well worth reading - but, in my view, not worth keeping or re-reading."
3,Author jumped from adventure,"This book tells the tale of many poor Catholic children in Ireland. I, personally do not understand why this book got such great reviews from critics. I thought that it was just an average book and I thought that Frank McCourt did not spend enough time telling us of of his adventures in good detail. I also didn't like the way he ended the book. I personally felt like I was left hanging at the end of the book."
4,An involving read,"This book was an odd read for me. I was initially unaware that it was an autobiography, which made the horror of McCourt's childhood even more intense. Being Irish-Catholic, it brought back a lot of memories of my childhood and I was thankful that mine wasn't as bad as his! :-) Not for the faint hearted."
5,Every sentence held my attention.,"Mr. McCourt's style of writing is unique; it's not traditional, but honest. He describes the characters in the book briefly, because their dialogues, moreso than their appearances, say a lot about their personalities. I learned about what life was like for the middle-lower class people of Ireland, about their struggles, ways of adapting, and beliefs. This book truly is a gem. I'd like to thank Frank for sharing his adventures."
5,"A wonderful, painful book to read","I loved this book! It is sometimes very painful to read, but the value is emmense. It can be light-hearted on one page and then almost too painful to get through on the next, but it is always worth it!To me, the most important thing to remember here is that this is NOT fiction! This man lived this childhood, and if he could survive and become successfull, I can certainly read about it.There is a great deal of value in reading how another can overcome the worst and triumph. It gives anyone hope!"
3,"I was hoping for a phoenix, but none arose.","The book is well constructed and crafted. However, I bought for the Irish hopefulness of an O'Hara or Flannigan, but none came. Hardly worth a tinkers dam, in my way of thinking. Why glorify the mum and da who never rose from the ashes? I can see that all on the telly!"
2,Terribly disappointed by the seemingly fictitious characters,"Having grown up in a fiercely Irish Catholic family, I could hardly wait to read the gift my husband gave to me for St. Patrick's day. Although amused by some of the antics of the main characters, I could not associate any with the characters my parents spoke so lovingly about in their years in poor Catholic familys in two different counties in Ireland. Unlike Mc Court's account, the characters my parents knew were hard working, even though sometimes hard drinking, and all had much more pride and were much more responsible about their families. I grew more and more suspicious about the so-called true accounts of life in a poor Irish family. I could hardly call this book literature. It seemed more like an attempt by Mc Court to create a best-seller rather than an attempt to truly interpret life in Ireland."
5,A must-read for all Catholic Irish-Americans!,Frank McCourt has finally given me a perspective on my Irish-American/Catholic upbringing. There were many things I never understood in my Irish Mother's attitude towards being Irish until I read this book.McCourt shatters the typically American images of Ireland with leprechans dancing at the end of rainbows in a patchwork green countryside. The bleak realities of life for the Irish are told with a wit and wisdom which softens the often disturbing images of McCourt's childhood.This book leaves the reader wanting more . . . What happened when you got here Frank? We all want to know!!!!!
3,Angela's Ashes Review,"Angela's Ashes is a wonderful book written about the author's childhood. It tells of his difficult family life, and the sickness and poverty in Ireland at the time. It's written beautifully in an Irish dialect that makes you fell part of the book. The slang expressions used by the characters are comical (i.e. ""arse""). The book deals with serious issues like alcoholism and religion, and sometimes it's depressing. The way the author uses flashbacks sometimes can confuse you, especially as the family moves back and forth between America and Ireland. Overall, the best part of the book is the easy storytelling style and the family love, which exists despite their problems."
5,What a read,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. As you read Frank McCourt's words, you can almost hear his voice, his accent reading the words to you.This is one of those books that once you are finished reading it, you don't want to start another book because there is no way any other book will top this one. Plus, you almost don't want to ruin the feeling you have once you are finished with it. But, thank goodness you still have 'Tis to look forward to!Very highly recommended."
5,Humor and imagination triumph over poverty and loss.,"McCourt has gained well deserved acclaim for his memoir Angela's ashes. I readit every available free moment that I had. McCourt reminds us that the ravagesof poverty are devastating. Complicated by his father's alcoholism and hismother's depression, the McCourt family endured inadequate housing, hungerin New York and in Ireland, They suffered preventable illness and theheartbreaking deaths of three children. What keeps the reader captivated is thehumor and resilience demonstrated by the McCourts in the face of tragedy. Areminder that not all immigrants lived the American Dream and that childrenhave always been the loosers when parents cannot get out of the trap ofpoverty."
4,"good, interesting, sad, emotional","A wonderful book, one of those, you cannot put away; you always want to continue reading. Although it is - from the literature aspect - not so exciting, it was so realistic, sometimes dramatic, sometimes funny and it is really worth to be read. I am interested, how his life had been going on and how the next book will be ..."
2,pathetic,"I read the book because my friends told me that it was a fantastic book. I was very disappointed. This is the reason why I am spending a few minutes typing this review. Warning: you have to be mentally and emotionally prepared to read this book. While I do agree with the view that some parts are well-written, it is just too dragging. It took me weeks to finish it.There are also inconsistencies in the way the writer talks about his surroundings from a child's point of view. In some parts of the book, Frank talks about Catholic practices that I thought were too esoteric for a kid. Manage your expectations well so you won't be disappointed."
2,"Okay, but written for Americans","Simply put, this book was written for Americans. It does not convey the hardships the Irish endured as they happened. The authors storytelling is repetitive babble, but the storyline was okay. However, if you want to read a good Irish book choose something written by an author who still lives and always has live in Ireland. There are many other great Irish literature works."
2,Break out the violins,"There's a lot of morbid fascination going on here. Maudlin, depressing. Abject bleakness and no hope gets hard to take with little humour or light shinning in. A sob story. The reason why people read it is so they can say ""at least that's not me."" That's what I thought."
1,A Pulitzer Prize for This?,"Rarely do I stop reading a book before I finish, but after I had read about a third of Angela's Ashes, I couldn't take it any more.Up to that point, I thought, ""This Frank McCourt fellow must be the smartest man who ever lived"" because of his detailed descriptions of what happened to him when he was two, three or five years old.But when I got to the part about his carrying a hog head around for about 10 pages, I stoppped.If the man had said in the introduction that he embellished some and relied on what others told him, that would have been fine; instead he presents everything as fact. Think about your childhood. Can you remember 1/100th of the details that McCourt apparently has at the tip of his tongue -- or fingers?Give me a break. If this book is worthy of the Pulitzer Prize, we all are in trouble."
1,Disappointing after so much hype.,"I wasted one of my Chrismas wishes on this book, which my husband paid full price hardback for! McCourt had a miserable life, no doubt about it, and it was amazing that he, his brothers and mother could still hold out hope every time Dad reappeared. For the life of me I cannot recall anything humorous in this book, despite the reviews of others citing this. It was the most depressing book I have ever read, and I several times had the misfortune to be reading during a meal (that'll teach me!) when I would come upon graphic descriptions of the chamber pot and its contents or the lavatory. The most moving parts of the story to me were the deaths of his siblings and when the horse went down. It did show how poverty is literally ""grinding"", and I cringe to realize there may be similar situations going on today in this country. Bottom line: If you must read this book, get it from the library."
1,Save your money.,"I waited until the book was in paperback to buy and only bought it then because I was going to Ireland and thought it might be interesting. Not much here. The family was poor, the father was a drunk and the mother had little inclination to better the situation. Once you have this figured out the book repeats it over and over. Its one redeeming feature: The narrative flows easily and one does not need to concentrate very hard to read it, so it doesn't take long to finish."
1,"Depressing, disgusting, but not because of McCourt","I had to read this for my book club and it turns out I'm glad they were all checked out at the library and all I could get was the audio tape. That way, I listened to McCourt drone and whine while I sat in traffic and I didn't have to waste valuable time reading it. I'm not Irish, but I was raised Catholic and he used jokes and bromides most of us had heard by the time we were ten. As a society, we deplore poverty, alcoholism, wife and child abuse, yet what voyeurs we become when some opportunist writes about any of the above! McCourt should be applauded for so adeptly using the American reading market to make money off his misery, but as a writer, he offers no more wisdom, insight or inspiration than Joan Crawford, Roseanne Barr or any other come-out-of-the-closet-dysfunctional-family-member who ever wrote a book."
1,"Overrated and goes nowhere, slowly.","My husband listened to the book-on-tape, read by the author, and raved about it. He insisted I listen as well. I'd heard all the ecstatic reviews and was planning to be in the car for several hours, so I agreed. What a mistake. Not only do I find it incredible that someone can ""remember"" so much minutae from early childhood, but I kept waiting for the story to develop along the lines of actual literature. I suppose that in a memoir you can't expect to follow every guideline to plot and character development. But if you can't follow any of them, is it really worth publishing? Essentially, it read like this: ""We were poor and dad drank. Then something bad happened to me. Then we were still poor and dad drank more. Another bad thing happened to me. We were still poor, and dad was still drinking. And more bad things happened. Then I did bad things too. The end."""
4,"Haunting, funny, sad, very moving.","I listended to this on audio while driving in remote locations. If I was looking for something to pick me up I found it. If I was looking for something to depress me I found it. From time to time I wanted to stop listening to this Irish voice but I could not. It was at times unbelievably sad. This is a modern day autobiography that could have been about the early 1800's. I am sure it happened, I wish it had not. I am sure it is still happening all over the world, and I wish it was not. And not once did the author ask for pitty about his experiences. He just wrote about them. A good read."
5,Angelas Ashes,"This is an amazing piece of work.Frank McCourt is such a wonderful writter.I felt such an emotional attachment to all the charecters and so badly wanted to help them. This book is a reminder of the graditude we should all have in our lives.Bottom line, this book makes you feel and it works its way under your skin. A masterpiece."
5,Be Thankful,"In Angela's Ashes, Frank McCourt touched me by his use of simple, straight forward use of vocabulary. In his writing, it was easy to tell that he wrote his true feelling while growing up, holding back nothing. When I read the book, it was like I was being told the story from a little, poor Irish boy, not an older man. McCourt's ability to do this created much more of an impact on the reader. It is amazing that he could remember such detail from his childhood. I started to feel like Frank McCourt, poor, hungry, and abused. At the same time I told myself never to complain about hunger or the need of clothes or shelter again. Not many books can do that for me, but this one did."
4,Angela's Ashes,"Not many of us could survive the abject poverty and ignorance that Frank McCourt's autobiography reveals. This tale of his Irish, Catholic upbringing in the lanes of Limerick could be one of the most depressing books you'll ever read. However, McCourt's strong character and innate sense of survival come shining through with his ability to bring out the humor in the most desperate of situations. The Irish, Catholics have often had many misfortunes visited on them, but this book gives you a first person account of the truth as seen through the eyes of a child. It is a must read."
5,Angela's Ashes: A Memoir,"I loved this book. It was really sad and funny at the same time. It really shows the poverty and strife of the people in Ireland, and I recommend it to anyone. I can't wait for the next to come out in paperback."
5,Buy This Book!!!!!!,"If graffiti means anything to you, BUY THIS BOOK!!!. It has amazing stories, INCREDIBLE pictures of his productions on walls, trains, etc. This guy is no joke and definitely put his time in the game. Absolutely recommended."
3,What's Up with this?,"So, has this book been released or not? The original release date was like 6 weeks ago, but Amazon still isn't shipping. Anyone know?"
2,Dumb,This is not what i thought it was going to be. I never play it and my kids won't play it and my mom won't play it my dad won't play it.
2,There's a reason you haven't heard of it.,"It is a bad game. No need to go into detail, it's just a bad game."
5,"Again, an excellent book for beginners and a good reference for intermediates !","I started first with ""C Primer Plus, 5th Edition"" by the same author and was already convinced about the quality of the information presented by Stephen Prata. This is why I had not doubts when I bought ""C++ Primer Plus, 5th Edition"" and, guess what ? Again, what an excellent book ! Well written, a lot of very useful examples, a lot of humor, as usual.If you already have a background in C, this book will be easier to follow.However, some parts are more difficult to understand because of the complexity of C++. In my opinion, C++ is a complete different way of thinking, and not only because of the OOP.But do not panic, Stephen Prata is there and will present you complex functionnalities in a such way that you will get them rapidly !So, if you are looking for a quality book about C++, you have found it !"
4,Too Complete!,"It is probably the best C++ book if you are looking for a bible-thick, encyclopedic book. For that, it serves both as a reference book and as a very complete textbook.However, if you are looking for a quicker read on C++, but still with sufficient material that actually allows you to start writing fairly complex codes, Accelerated C++ by Koenig and Moo is a better option."
4,Worth the purchase,"I found the book to be very useful. Coming from a self tought background of python, php and vb.net, I found the book adequate to answer every unknown concept I had run into teaching myself other languages.I wouldn't suggest trying to learn a language like C++ as a starter language, but after reading through most of this book I can not see how I could ever become more than a novice programmer without a little of this type of knowledge.Some of the later chapters suffer from what I call 'sample asphyxiation', but that is a trend that I noticed in all of programming books I have read."
4,"Exceptional book, but binding is inferior","C++ Primer Plus (5th Edition)This is probably the best C++ book I have read. It is not overly technical or cryptic, but it can still effectively teach the language to anyone. With just the right amount of humor, it walks the reader through all of the technical concepts.This book, however, has a very poor binding. Before I even opened the book, I could see that the binding was starting to come apart. Every time I opened it up thereafter, it came apart a little bit more. I understand that this is a 1200-page book, but there is no excuse for the binding."
5,THE book for learning C++,"I learned more in this book, and more in depth, in a chapter then I have in any other resource for C++.(Don't worry, I have read much more then just a chapter.) Prata will cover everything from how large a data type is in memory to the most advanced topics like inheritance, and all very well explained! I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn C++."
3,"OOP with C++ , Good but not Great !","I bought this book while taking my first CS classes at the university and it just put some order in my OOP understanding. Some of my friends found it to be very ambiguous and confusing. For any student who's taking CS classes I would advise to look around, this book is good but not great!It's geared toward the beginner/novice programmer and the info is in depth.Bottom line: 3 stars"
1,A book on C++ Syntax,"Since about 1995, programs consist of buttons, text boxes etc. on various forms. (i.e. for the last 15 years)There is no mention of buttons, forms, windows, or text boxes at all in this book.There are roughly 1200 pages in this book and it seems that all of these pages deal with an output function called ""cout"" which puts text on the screen.I don't need to ""put text on the screen"" I need to put ""buttons on the screen"". That, unbelievably, is not in the book.No reference to graphics, bitmaps, transparency, drawing -> nothing.It seems to be a 1200 page c++ syntax reference.I have about 30 years of in-depth programming experience and my only question is ""how can I send it back"".It's not only a waste of money, it was a real waste of time. (having read the first 150 pages ""hoping"" it would sooner or later get better."
5,Excellent beginner book,"I am a java developer with 10+ years of experience, with no prior experience programming in C/C++. I have read a lot of technical books. This book clearly explains all the concepts you need to know to get started programming in C++. It gets into just enough detail to let you be able to understand every concept. I didnt know there was so much to learn to get into C++ coming from java."
1,bad packaging,"There were stickers all over this when I got it. Some were bar code stickers, some were lables. After peeling all of these off, there was a ton of 'gunk' on the product. I used goo gone and then put it through the washer and it is still there. pain in the ass..."
3,Rust form on the handle after a few washes by hands.,"I purchase this Microplane 38006 Professional Series Large Shaver almost a month ago. It is very sharp, I also order the Microplane 38057 Professional Series Grater Attachment at the same time. However, after using it for a few time I noticed rust forming on one side of the frame at the underside near the non-slip rubber grip handle. The blade is fine, no rust there. I am worry that the rust will eventually eats through the frame. The handle has a poor workmanship, both sides look and feel rough on the underside. I like this MP professional series large shaver, I want to order a course professional series grater. Now, I just have to wait and see ..."
5,New Favorite,"I love the Microplane graters, but was very disappointed with the acrylic mounted models; even with careful handling and no dishwasher, they would crack and break within a year. Spend the extra $$ for the professional series with the metal sides! This large shaver is wonderful for grating hard cheeses, like parmesan, or chocolate and it is much easier and safer to use and clean than the ribbon cutter that cuts in both directions. I love this one so much I also give it to friends and family who enjoy cooking."
4,Great figure,"Psylocke is a pretty cool figure. I don't understand why Toy Biz used so many different female figure styles. This one in particular isn't that great in the hips and torso, but she still looks really great."
2,Substandard,"Not a great version of Psylocke. The figure is ugly and even though it looks highly articulate it is not and few things on her bend very very well and the head is both disproportionate and not very movable. Don't waste your money on this one. Get the 3 3/4"" one, much better."
2,Disappointed,"I wa very diasappointed with this, so i purchased the vhs, to check it out, not really a keeper, more of a rental and return, it just showed clips of the movie, with an intro from phil collins, who has an extra in a scene of the film, the extra features on disc two of A Hard Days Night,will do for a Beatle fan..Dont waste your money on this."
4,Great tunes,"I hesitated about buying this CD because some of the reviews seemed to suggest that it was smooth jazz. However, it is a very enjoyable album, with some great tunes. The problem is that Kenny does not really allow himself to stretch out the way he did on ""Songbook"". How about a live album?"
1,i don't like this CD,"This CD bummed me out. I was hoping to hear some fancy ""young lion jazz"" -my first mistake- and instead got fusion. Only 2 1/2 tunes on the CD swing. The rest are all funk vamps. These are good musicians but I heard this music the first time around and don't have much desire to here a more commercial, less adventurous version than what came before."
3,Could've been better.,"Kenny Garrett is by far one of the top horn players on the jazz scene today but his CD efforts seem to be going on a decline. This CD is not for hard core Hard Bop fans, rather it would be more for those who like pop/jazz with the occasional hard bop tune mixed in. Stick with Triology, Songbook, or Pursuance."
1,Who is the target audience?,"It's a shame that such a talented player gets caught up in this mishmosh of material. There were two cuts I really enjoyed: ""Tango in 6"" and ""Song #8"". The former featured a nice interesting and original tune with a beautiful and intense solo from Bobby Hutcherson. The latter features Some nice up tempo playing from Kenny which I wish we could here more of on this album. A couple of cuts feature a mixed bag of vocal heads along with Fender twang from Miller and too many tunes start out with a rhythm vamp that launches into predictable and shall we say, less than challanging chord changes all taken at tempos that border on sleepwalking."
3,Happy People,"Happy People has a cut that is out of this world. No.4 ""Ain't Nothing But The Blues"" is worth price of entire CD. This is one of those cuts that can carry you into another world. I have driven three hours with that one five minute cut (No.4) playing on ""repeat mode"", arrived at my destination and still sat in my car until set finished. I would be first in line to hear Kenny Garrett do an entire concert off that one cut, just taking variations, solos, fun experimentation, funky experimentation, into a continuous mesmerizing stratum. Matter of fact, I'd pay twice the ticket price."
5,My favorite baby gift,This was all three of my kids favorite sorter and I loved playing it with them. Now it's my go-to baby gift!
2,Hoom Hoom,Some interesting essays for sure but most of it is recycled stuff a lot of Tolkien fans will have read before. Worth a gander if you are new to Tolkien. But better to spend your time reading the books I think.Get the Letters instead.
4,People's Guide a must for Tolkien fans,"If you are a fan at all of Tolkien's works and those inspired by him, this book is one of the best collections of thoughtful, artistic writers expressing the impact of the Professor's influence I've ever read. Their perspective on Tolkien's world come first-hand from those who were fans long before the films made Middle-earth so popular. It's a bonus that they are closely connected to the filmmakers; which only adds to their insight. Their moving entries span from humorous to emotional. There's something for everyone here. A must for Tolkien-lovers."
5,Fun for all ages!,"This game was so fun! Once we figured out the best way to create a score sheet we were off and running. I played this game with friends whose ages ranged from 14 - 70 and it was very interesting the types of words people came up with. It's like Scrabble, except it's with cards and there are only 8 rounds. Each round you get one more card. The words are no longer than 5 letters long and the best part is being able to use a dictionary when it's not your turn. In the last round we started helping eachother to see if we could use up all of our card to score more points. I recommend this to anyone (especially those who like to play card games). There's even a Solitaire(sp?) version which is very fun too."
3,"Quiddler: fun, but poor directions",It took quite a while to figure out how to play this because the directions are very poorly written. I think we are finally playing the way that it was intended; just hope we can remember the next time we bring it out.
3,Scrabble for up to 8,"This card game is a great exercise if you want to show off your broad knowledge of 2- and 3-letter words. It is like scrabble. My family played with 7 people, but it took a while to learn the rules collectively."
5,Quiddler,"My friends and family have a riot playing this game. We are big scrabble fans so this is great to play too. It's even easy for younger players, since you mostly spell short words."
3,Fun but TOO complicated.,"Way too complicated for a kids toy. We threw away the instructions and basically played Rummy with it, but spelled words. I could see this being a fun drinking game for adults but my nephew lost interest pretty quickly. The cards seem durable."
5,Quiddler,"My husband and I like card games where you don't have to move the pieces or need a board to play. Quiddler is a card ""scrabble"" type of game, fun for two and easy to learn and play. The scoring is easy and the game is limited by the number of deals you play.It plays similar to rummy.The entire game is only a special deck of cards! The cards have letters and point value. You make words then ""go out"". Fun, fun game!"
4,Family fun plus educational,"This game will be great for the grandkids. While they are having fun, it will be educational too.family game"
5,Quiddler- a delightful word game,We were introduced to this game by friends we were visiting while we were on vacation. It was such a delightful game and we decided we wanted to purchase it for ourselves and for other family members and friends. We were able to find it on Amazon.com and ordered several sets. We would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves word games!
5,Fabulous game!,"This game is a hit with our kids! It is really helping them to become faster & more versatile when it comes to spelling. I enjoy watching my kids learn from it. Even our youngest can play along and he's just a beginning speller. Unfortunately, it's boring for adults but we have found that you can adjust the rules to make things more fun (like by adding more rounds with more cards or by making all of the words have to fit to a specific topic). Overall I think this game was well worth the money & my kids are definitely benefitting from it!"
5,addictive!,"This game is a winner! I ordered this game months ago just from the description, having never heard of it. We've given it as a gift to numerous people, and now friends and family members also find it a favorite and are buying it for others. Have a dictionary on hand....there's always someone who comes up with a word you've never heard of...and someone else raising his or her eyebrows. Fans range in age from 10 to 70. It's very hard to find in stores, so buy it here."
5,more fun than scrabble with cards,"this is like playing scrabble with cards...very portable, great fun, a vocal builder, highly recommended. good for all ages, can be played individually or by teams."
5,An enjoyable word game,"While I have always enjoyed board games, word games specifically have remained challenging for me. I refuse to play Scrabble with my husband, as his skills are superior to mine and it is intimidating to play with him. Hooray, Quiddler has given me an edge into what I term as word games. I only have to be concerned about the cards in my hand, while playing attention to the discard/ draw deck-easy verses the interconnectivity of letters on a board which only multiply.Each player starts with 3 cards during the first round and the number of cards dealt increases by one in subsequent rounds. The game seems to become more challenging in later rounds when you have more cards in your hands and are trying to create words and ""go out"". Enjoyable with two or more players!"
5,I just Love This Game!,"A good friend of mine introduced me to this game this past winter. I think she may be sorry she did because it created an addiction! I would describe this simple yet thoroughly enjoyable game as similar to Scrabble but with cards. Each card has a letter and a corresponding point value. The object of the game is to score as many points with the words you create in each successive hand. I won't go into explaining the rules and how to play the game, but I will tell you that it is an extremely fun game the entire family can play. It truly is one of the best games I have seen in along while. It is so much fun that even when my friend severely beats me in a game I still enjoy playing!! Well, I have to go... I hear her calling and I gotta play some Quiddler!"
5,"Great, educational game!","This game is great for lovers of Scrabble who don't want to spend 2 hours playing a game. It is a fast but fun game that you can play with any number of people. I enjoy it becuase kids and adults alike can enjoy and learn from this game. It involves arranging your cards (with letters on them) into words. You get points based on the length of the word and the letters that you use. It helps get kids interested in spelling and vocabulary, but it is still a lot of fun for adults to play. My husband went to a bed and breakfast where they had this game, and we spent several hours of our anniversary playing Quiddler. It is very fun."
5,Fun Constructing Words,"When I first saw this card game my thought was, ""Like Scrabble, but with cards"", and I've never been a big fan of Scrabble. But Quiddler is a whole lot more fun than Scrabble. Players are dealt cards, 3 in the first hand, 4 in the next, up to 10 in the last hand. The idea is to use all the cards in your hand to make a word, or words, which together use all your cards. Players draw and discard until someone can do so, then the remaining players get one last chance to draw and use as many cards as they can. Scoring is based on the point value of each card used, with more uncommon letters worth more points.Reading my description may not be exciting, but the game is just plain fun. Builds your vocabulary too!"
4,Thumbs up for Quiddler,Quiddler is a fun word game. It forces the players to learn a lot of short words that they may not be familiar with through daily usage. Portable so we take it on trips.
1,A dissent from the positive reviews...,"Reading all the positive reviews, I'm wondering if we all played the same game. In a nutshell, this game is far too easy, far too short, and not very interesting. The winner is more determined by who goes first than anything else, and frankly, the letter distribution is such that it is near impossible not to make a word immediately. My wife and I played this game two or three times before we were utterly bored. This is contrast to ""Word Thief"", also a Scrabble like word card game. That game, however, is far more challenging, much more involved, and will last more than 5 minutes, and can be played with as little as two players. Buy ""Word Thief"", and forget ""Quiddler""."
5,Excellent for Family and Friends,I've played this game with young and old. I've played it in groups of three to eight. It's always fun and it makes you feel smart!
5,"Nice game for some ""down time""","Great game to play with a friend at a coffee house! It looks like an easy game, but it is similar to scrabble."
5,Quiddler,Haha! We love this game! It was introduced to us and we immediately went home and searched Amazon to be able to purchase a set for ourselves. Great condition! Love it!
5,Scrabble without frustration,"My wife and I absolutely love this game. We like Scrabble, but never know if it will be a fun game or one where it is just 2 hours of frustration because the board is tight. Quiddler still has the same anagramming type game play, but no frustration. It works great for 2-6 people, including kids. Since you can use multiple short words or a single long word to use up your cards, there is no reason a child with limited vocabulary couldn't play this game with some success. Just buy it, it is a cheap game and will get tons of use if you like word games."
5,Quiddler,love this game. its fun and teaches your to explore new words. highly recommended for a family night game.
4,Easy to Learn and Play,Great game to learn and fun to play. Order was easy and arrived quickly. (It was a gift for a family member). Great service.
2,Family card game,"We have not had much time to play this game, it is a game meant for more than 2 players, more exciting with more people."
1,Arrival time and usability,"Thank you for the game ""Quiddler."" It arrived in great time and I will buy from you in the future. It is a FUN game --- I love it."
2,Fun if you're lucky,"If you're lucky enough to get the right letters in your hand, you'll probably have a good time. If you happen to get a handful of vowels and Qs, however, you get a lesson in futility. My wife and I did invent a fun game with these beautiful cards, though: everyone draws 7 and then tries to make up a sentence with words that start with the first letters on the cards. Much more fun!"
4,Quiddler is great!,"I had never heard of Quiddler before I noticed it in Amazon.com. I read the reviews and decided to give it a shot. Well, when we opened this at Thanksgiving, we played it for hours and hours. Then we found the directions and played it for hours more. I have had to purchase 4 more games for people who want this game. One I know, will be going to school with a 6th grade teacher. A real help with spelling. Our 12 and 13 year olds were begging to play again."
4,good fun for the whole family,Much easier than Scrabble for the younger kids. And rules can be slightly modified to make it more challenging or make the game go faster.
5,Quiddler is great for kids and adults!,Quiddler is a great game. It's fun and any one from about 7 and up can play. It is a game that would be fun for the whole family. It moves quickly.
5,Great game for all ages,"Fun, stimulating, educational. What more can you say for a game at this price. Good for children learning to spell, great for adults and a good brain challenge to come up with longer and more complex words. Used with or without a dictionary, its a fun game and brings family and friends together."
5,Quiddler Review,"We have a lot of company in our home and we ordered several sets of ""Quiddler"". The ages are from 40 to 90 and it is game to have an enjoyable time. The people love it."
5,Great Word Game,"If you like word games, this is a great way to have fun with up to 8 people. The game goes fast and everyone has a fine time."
5,Quiddler,"I bought this card game for my daughters, ages 10 and 11. Our whole family has had a blast playing it, and the age of the player is not necessarily an advantage/disadvantage. My husband and I frequently play when the kids are doing something else. We play a lot of Phase 10, which moves too slow for me. This game moves faster."
4,For wordy and non-wordy people,This game is great if your players have different levels of word skills. There are bonuses both for the longest word and for the most words in each round (lots of little words) so there is a chance for the non-wordy people to compete!
5,order site is not user friendly,I am writing to advise you that I will buy no more products from you until you rework your website to make it user friendly. AS it is now a shopper cannot view all items in the cart until checkout only to find errors then try to delete items or quantities -- it's a nightmare resulting in recieving the wrong items and amounts. i thought i ordered 2 authors games and 1 women authors game only to open my package to find 3 authors games and no womens authors.Wayne Bacon
2,Not quite as fun as it sounds,"My mom bought this for me at our local bookstore. It sounds like it would be fun on the box, but once you start playiung iot is somewhat confusing and quite boring. I have tried playing it a few times and just can't seem to find the fun in it. My advice is to not get the game unless you REALLY want to."
2,It's a Solitaire Game for Many People,"The only interaction is that during your play/turn you get to chance to choose from the discard pile and only the card that the person before discarded. It's also too easy to make words and go out, two rounds is the norm; and the larger the word made means nothing extra. The high review average for this game says something about the people posting reviews in general."
3,Boring and overly simplistic for talented Scrabble players; likely fun for kids though,"I am a huge fan of Scrabble. I bought Quiddler so my girlfriend and I could play it together, thinking it would be Scrabble-like. Unfortunately, for seasoned Scrabble players who know most 2-letter words in the Scrabble dictionary (ab, mu,mi, xu, ...) this game is boring: the reason is that one can do a ""lay down"" of all their cards on the first or second turn practically every time. If you are a Scrabble player who regularly scores in the high 300s and who knows a lot of 2-letter and 3-letter words, I doubt you will enjoy this game, because it is all luck and no strategy.However, for kids, or others who don't know the many 2-letter and 3-letter words in the Scrabble Dictionary, this game may indeed be fun."
4,One of the best word games,"I've now had this game for years and it continues to be one of the favorites within the household and among the gaming groups I play with. Particularly enjoyable for those who also enjoy word games in general, and in particular a good game to introduce to Scrabble fans who may not have experience with many/any other word games. If there is a flaw it's that outcomes tend to be a bit reliant on one's initial draw - it's common to not make it around for even a whole round before someone is able to ""lay down."" That could be a plus, though, if you prefer games that have a fast pace. And in any case is still a test of skill with creating words given limited resources."
4,Moderately fun and educational,"Scrabble with cards! You have to use all your letter cards to make words, beware if someone else completes this task first, as the cards you can't put into a word are subtracted from your score. Luck is as much a friend as strategy, so can be frustrating when someone picks up 10 cards which can be put into words in the first round... and you have a hand full of consonants... I still prefer Scrabble, but Quiddler is different enough that we'll still play it."
5,Great game for all ages!,"We've been playing this game for about 18 months now, and it's still as popular as ever with us. We're a family of 5, with the youngest playing since he was six years old - and winning more often than I thought he could! And of course, we've all had our vocabularies expanded without trying, but we haven't let on that this is an educational game. Folks who aren't confident in their vocabulary, don't despair! Two- and three-letter words can win the game as well as much larger words. If you like Perquacky, Scrabble, and that sort, you'll love this much-more-portable word game."
5,Well worth it.,"For such a simple concept, this game is a lot of fun. We can play in any of the languages used in our home (English, French, or Spanish). I enjoy this game more than I do the traditional game of Scrabble, mainly because it is a quicker game and you can keep a running score of how well (or how poorly) you are doing. Other great features are the portable nature of the game; the single/two-person/multiple-player modes of play; and the sturdy, laminated cards. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys crosswords and other word puzzles."
5,We thoroughly enjoy this card game.,"Whether with a group or just my wife and I, playing Quiddler is great fun."
3,Disappointed me -- not much blue cheese,I ordered these olives through igourmet at amazondotcom as I once had a dirty martini with blue cheese olives at Ditka's and it was fantastic. The can had opened during shipping and olive juice was all over my other items. Looking at the olives they were big and meaty but I could hardly see any blue cheese in them.
3,Misleading product,"The packet said rainbow blend but I only got one color of coleus - purple center with green leaves. It's a nice color but I was expecting a variety, as advertised. I got over 70% germination which would be great except that they were all the same variety of coleus."
1,Disgusting.,Looking for accurate and truthful information about witchcraft? Then DO NOT buy this book. Ever. (Try Scott Cunningham instead.)
5,Very informative . . .as always,"While most people would say that witchcraft has nothing to do with the Devil, witchcraft does. Wicca does not. This book is about witchcraft. the old ways of the Middle Ages, before and beyound. I think this book is very well written and complete as one of Ashley's books in the occult series.The book satified my desire for knowledge and I would recommend this book to anyone with interest in the wide world of teh occult. For the record . . . Ashley is a very smart and educated and wise man, well and greatly knowledgeble in the occult"
1,stupid,"Any book which links witch craft with the devil is stupid. Anyone who knows ANYTHING about the Craft will know that the devil is not a part of Wicca at ALL. Witchs don't even belive in the devil. We do not kill babies, humans or animals as our Goddess is the mother of all living things and killing something would be killing one of her children"
2,Already Out-of-date,"There is pretty much no reason to buy this memory card at this point. Nintendo (whose products are always incredibly reliable) has already released their Memory Card 251, which has more than twice the storage space for only $5 more than this card. First-party memory cards are virtually ALWAYS more reliable and stable than products from other companies. Plus, the Memory Card 251 is the same shape and size as the Memory Card 59, which is smaller than this InterAct memory card. There is basically NO REASON to buy this memory card. Just spend the extra $5 on a card that is better in every respect."
2,Fail,"How difficult can it be to make a plastic storage clipboard? Apparently pretty hard. The main folder meant to hold standard letter size paper pushes the paper out into the plastic clasp, crushing it when closed. The same folder also makes it more challenging to get the clipboard to close for carrying correctly. I like the compartments in the bottom, but that main folder is a deal-breaker. I paid far too much money for something that can't even perform a simple job."
1,Wont hold 8.5x11 internally!!,"We bought this to hold 8.5x11 work orders for our technicians in the field. Simple enough request, that is what it is advertised to do. THEY DON""T FIT!!!! You can't close the lid with normal sized sheet of paper in it. Really, they made a clipboard for holding paper, that you can't close with paper in it? This is ridiculous. What a waste of plastic. Do not buy this if you plan on using it with normal paper.Additionally, the workmanship is poor. The internal divider come out if you try to access the compartments underneath it. We will be returning these ASAP."
3,Parts don't fit well together,"Parts do not fit well together and once it is closed, you have to really work at it to get it open. After some practice, you realize that you have to hold each part in the center to get it to open. If the plastic were a little thicker and the parts fit better together this would be an awesome clipboard."
1,Bad Design!,Hard to open due to it sticking at the top or bottom outer corner. Clip to keep close doesn't stay clipped from day 1 causing stuff to be able to slide out from the corner that isn't stuck closed. Also internal organizer doesn't stay in place like it should. I ended up returning this the day I got it. Horrible design.
3,"Okay, not great","It works, but i found another to do what I wanted. Seems over built and lacks features. May be the right item for some, not me."
1,Sticks and binds,"Parts do not fit together properly, so it is always a problem to open it. Gotta pull and tug. Guess I got a bad one. With the price, not worth returning."
5,"Siren song, absolutely!","This is one of the most engaging Roxy Music albums I've ever heard. There are haunting ballads, thundering rockers ... something for everyone. I find that words fail me in describing this album, which is a pity. The primary hit single from the record, ""Love Is The Drug,"" demonstrates Roxy's musical strengths and catchy lyrics perfectly, not to mention showcasing Bryan Ferry's amazingly sultry voice. Not to be missed!"
2,Every album has it's fans and I'm not one of this ones,"I've not played this album in a while, I haven't wanted or cared to. I did play it about fifteen times when I first bought and basically came away feeling indifferent to it's charms with the exception of ""Love is the Drug"" and ""Both Ends Burning"", which I can hear on almost any compliation that has ever been issued.I don't hate this album but it never seems to catch fire and it didn't particularly reward actively giving it my undivided attention with the above noted exceptions. It was quite a let down after ""Country Life"".I wish I had seen the review by Ira Robbins in The Trouser Press first before buying it on spec. He thought it was ""disappointingly dull"", which I basicly agree.It is probably the last Roxy Music album I would buy a CD copy of.Well, maybe before ""Viva!"" which is a more dynamic set of performances ruined by shrill, loud female backup singers."
4,Worth Owning,"My favorites are the first two albums and it had been over 20 years since I last listend to Siren, but I wanted to round out my Roxy CD collection. I'm glad I got it because ""Just Another High"" is brilliant and I'm really getting into ""Could it Happen to Me"". ""Both Ends Burning"" is great, but the live version on Viva Roxy Music is fantastic. Overall Siren is very good (except tracks 1, 2, and 4). And I now rate Siren higher than Country Life. Of course, ""If There is Something"" from the first album and Viva (the live album) is the greatest song of all time - glad I have the 12 minute version from the bootleg Roxy Musci Live on the BBC."
4,LOOK NO FURTHER,If your a genuine hard bop fan you need to look no further than this and it's cotinuation CD- PARISIAN THOROUHFARE for great individual tracks which possibly could have been differently programmed. Best ever Bobby Jasper on tenor. That's why Clifford Jordan didn't make the trip. For more Donald Byrd- Live- see George Wallington AT THE CAFE BOHEMIA and Pepper Adams-- 10 to 4 AT THE FIVE SPOT
1,Stay away from this one !!,"I give it one star because the audio really is good. Unfortunately the CD player, as others have noted, sucks!!! I've only had it 6 months and now it won't play my CD's. Two places that I took it to for repair said it would cost more than the unit is worth to fix it, if they even could !! So if you are into MP3 it might be ok, but otherwise try a different brand."
4,"Great sound, great look","I have this toy for already 4 years and still happy with it.It sounds great even for a bigger room.Have read many negative reviews, specially over the timing it takes to recognize, read and play a CD be it regular music CD, MP3 or a CDR - it really take a while but this isn't such a big annoying issue! Its sound quality compensates it all!"
2,Too Bad Sony Sounds So Good,"Quality in sound for the buck is what Sony is good for.When the CD player works, that is.If you have a lot of CD-Rs or you like CDs of any kind to play without skips or hesitations, do not buy Sony.I have already sworn never to buy another Sony CD player.I expect a CD to play consistently and without interuption.Sony seems to have skimped on this little engineering aspect."
3,Thought about it,"I did not acutally buy this system because after playing with it in the store I realized you have to stop the CD that is playing to add or change another one. I found that to be slow and annoying.So I bought the Sharp XLHP500, which does have play exchange, wonderful sound quality, and great looks. Check it out."
1,Don't buy it!!!!!!!!,"It was fine until one day about 7 months after I bought it the cd player stopped working due to a mechanical error and would not eject the 5 cd's I had in there. I called ""support"" but because I didn't still have the receipt they were unable and unwilling to help me.Save yourself the frustration and buy something else. Anything else."
2,Great set but thin audio,"This album is in dire need of a remastering, as is sounds very thin without alot of clarity on the drums and almost no bass definition. Much better stuff from Buddy out there that sounds better on new equipment."
5,Some Swingin' Big Band,"Buddy Rich...Great Jazz Drummer, some love him, some hate him; this is a testament to his legacy as a musician, and will probably change your mind about his playing. This is a compilation of great recordings made from 1955-1961, mostly of some standard big band charts.As always, with Buddy Rich, theses arrangements are made his own through incredible drumming and an amazing band! To list a few: Conrad Gozzo, Pete Candoli, Harry ""Sweets"" Edison, Jimmy Rowles, Sonny Criss, Phil Woods, Al Cohn, Benny Golson, Ernie Wilkins, Max Roach, Stanley Turrentine, Ben Webster, and more...This is an energy-packed album worth hearing for any jazz fan, especially those fans of great big band music. Some of these arrangements are a little sparser, and offer a more intimate setting among some all-time great musicians!Check it out if you can find it!"
2,limited learning value,"I have fond memories of playing with math blaster and reading blaster as a kid on an Apple IIc. However, as a parent, I don't feel that this updated version of reading blaster would have much educational value. It is not suitable for kids still learning their phonics, but perhaps may provide limited fun for kids who are more advanced. The games are too easy to succeed at by simply guessing at all the words (there are no penalties or buzzing sounds for wrong answers). I would not consider this to be a useful educational title."
5,electronic super-glam art,This is hard music to classify - easy music to enjoy! The first two albums of Roxy with Brian Eno are soooo good - believe the hype. This is experimental rock at its finest!
3,Artsy tunesmith,"3 1/2Absolutely noticeable debut for these art-rock, early 70's glam gods contained enough attention-grabbing creativity to warrant much exaltation. There are at least a few classics contained within where the group already found a great balance between the art and rock. A fair deal however is spent in perpetual experimentation where either a lack of cohesion or a surplus of pretension robs the whole album of a certain fluidity."
4,Es bueno,"Es un CD interesante, no tiene nada que ver con los CD posteriores, el primero es más eclectico, interesante en la propuesta de la conjución de varios estilos de música que posee cada uno de los integrantes, Brian Eno es excelente en la inclusión de ruidos combinados con música"
2,"gotta have it if y're a Roxy Music fan; otherwise, no...","One great song, perhaps one additional good song. The rest are pedantic and boring. I don't now why this album ever stirred such interest in the first place. Their later albums were much, much, much superior. Unless you luv this band, don't waste your money."
3,The exceptional Debut,I liked it but a lot of songs were terrible. They started off on the wrong note and ended a lot better. Avalon is a great CD and there best one is Siren. if you're looking for the best one don't buy this. but if you're a collector you need this
4,Its very unique.,"I just had to buy this because I loved it when I was younger and ALWAYS would rent it from blockbuster. It seemed a lot harder then, though. Regardless, its still just as fun. There are beautiful graphics and its has a cool plot. The controls are hard to learn though and its very touchy.."
2,Could be outstanding...,"We decided on a PS2 over the newer PS3 and Wii due to the price and the good availability of games you can still get for PS2. Ecco was one of our first choices for a good family game. It's nonviolence and beautiful graphics and learning of dolphin culture are outstanding. Having said that, the game is too difficult for the youngsters in our group and even the adults are not impressed with the cumbersome ""charge"" mode that is not very effective on sharks. The map is not of much value. We quickly grew frustrated with it, overall. :("
5,VERY good!,"I got this game for ps2. It has fantastic graphics, the dolphins, the creatures, the landscape, the fantasy acessories in the game looks real! The storyline is a bit confusing, and some levels are hard in the beginning, but you soon find a way to do it. I'm almost finished with it, but Idon't dare to play it more, the last levels are so scary! I know I sound like a 4 years old girl when I say it's scary, but the graphics looks so real, and the sounds so real, so I don't dare to go any further! You should absolutely buy this!"
2,"Ecco is fun, but could use some refinement.","My initial review:I don't dislike Ecco, but the controls and graphics are somewhat over-rated. The underwater scenes are not as convincing as they should be for the PS2. Also, the challenges sometimes seem like tedious buys work. I would recommend this game for those looking for something different, but it is not on my ""must have"" list.Added 05/27/02:After trying to play this game for a few weeks, I have learned to hate it. Save your money, this game is of poor quality and can be very frustrating."
1,broken,"the game did not work, it was completely covered in scratches. tried it on multiple systems with no success. this sucks."
3,They kind of ruined it.,"OK, I'll get straight to the point. This could've been a great game. It's not bad, but still. Here's the reviews:The Good:1.Awesome graphics2.The dolphins, turtles, sharks, ect. look real!3.You can jump out of water and do flips and stuff.The bad:1.Horrible controls2.You have air suppily underwater. Yeah, dolphins do really have air suppily, but let me ask you something. Do gorillas? Not Donkey Kong. Get rid of the air suppily.3.The levels are like mazes.4.If you get hit by an enemy once (say by a shark), it takes away more than a fourth of your health.The bonuses:...None...The bottom line:Rent, don't get."
1,Not good,"This game isn't good. It's nothing like the original games for Genesis. Want to play good games? Then get Ecco the Dolphin, Ecco 2 The Tides of Time, and Ecco Jr. for Genesis."
3,What?,"This story doesn't make sence! I do like how you just swim around and all, but what's the story all about. I jus t think it's just an excuse to play as a dolfin. The person who said that it is the best graphics they'd seen for PS2 mus t be an oldy."
1,time to harpoon that ...dolphin...,"This is nothing but a bunch of politicaly correct,tree-hugging enviromentalist crap!!All you do is swim around and uhm swim around and ahhh...yeah swim around.Your ""weapon"" is that annoying,finger-nails-against-a-chalkboard skreetch:EEEEEHHHH EEEIII EEEEE!!!I purposely died throughout the game just to see him float belly up to the surface...Ecco the dolphin needs to stop making video games... and go get beached or caught in a net...."
5,Underwater Fantasy,"Ecco the Dolphin is a wonderful journey into a world so beautiful, one can only fantasize about it. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous and the game keeps you in awe! I really enjoyed it from the moment I first popped it in."
3,"Very informative, but....","I want to preface my remarks by saying that I am not an African history scholar nor have I read a lot about the subject. My purpose for purchasing this book was to learn about the origins of the great cultures that grew out of the African continent. I was partially satisfied.Whereas much of the information that was provided was new to me, the total package left me wanting more. The format (a series of lectures) was very redundant with many chapters repeating the same information.Being an American of African descent, I share the author's anger with the ""experts"" in the field that have re-written the history of Africa and her people to suit their own desires. However, I don't need to be reminded in every paragraph , in every chapter for 700 pages. I would have preferred more of the history and less of the diatribe."
5,Simply a Great Book for All Levels,"I hadn't touched a SLR since High School (don't ask how long ago that was). When picking the hobby back up several years ago, a friend recomended I read this book to ""refamiliarize"" myself with what constitutes a quality exposure, and how to see exposures in a creative and effective way. In a semi-joking matter, he told me that out of the thousands I was spending on new gear, this $15 would probably be my most valuable purchase. He was right.Peterson has a tremendous eye, and has a wonderful way of explaining the ""basics"" of photography in a way that benefits both novices and experienced photogs alike. His unique perspective on how to take pictures, combined with a plethora of phenomenal snaps to illustrate concepts, was extremely enlightening.Don't think twice - get this book."
5,Just what I was hoping for,"Understanding Exposure is exactly what I was looking for. I shoot hundreds of high school sports related photos each week as a fan and father. While I understand more than many of my fiends and my photos are generally pretty well done I have never been comfortable with shooting full manual (Canon Digital Rebel and now 30D). As the light changes during the games I have had difficulties. This book puts the trio of Shutter Speed, Aperature and ISO in easily understandable terms and shows results in pictures that include what settings were used and why. I now get depth of field and shooting ""wide open"" or what macro shots look like and how to get them. Ultimately this book was worth a great deal more that the $15 I spent. In fact I find myself reviewing sections in more of a how-to refresher before I shoot. Now I may miss the shot, but my exposure settings will be in the right ballpark."
2,"Overrated, Hyped","Well, I just suffered through this book from cover to cover. I find myself with mixed feelings.On one hand, I could recommend this to a beginning photographer, because Mr. Peterson does alwaysend up with the correct bottom line and makes good photos. What made the book so hard to swallow forme is that his understanding of why things work is almost always flawed, misleading, and just plain weird.Like a cookbook with great recipes, but telling you something like ""always use two eggs when youbake a cake because one egg will be lonely and it won't come out right"". If you don't mind that kindof thing, dive in and buy the book."
2,This is an ok introduction to digital photography but don't believe you will learn enough to take good pictures after reading it,"The author did a good job talking about how to take pictures. The contents are pretty good. But seriously, don't believe in the author that this is all you need to know.In the world of digital pictures, this is probably 5% of what you should know. Unfortunately, I didn't find out for a while and wasted valuable time.It doesn't talk about much regarding digital photography, and the use of features offered by the new technology to take good pictures. It merely gives you some basic idea about aperture and shutter speed. It doesn't even talk too much about ISO and noise reduction."
2,You can learn more reading online for an hour,"I just got this book a few days ago and already read through the whole thing. I'm dumbfounded that this is considered a ""must have"" book by so many. If you knew absolutely NOTHING -- and I mean NOTHING -- about photography then this book might be great for you. But if you're online reading this review, then you have access to a search engine and the web at-large. You can learn everything this book has to offer and then some by simply Googling around for how tos, photography blogs, and forums online.When it comes down to it, I just feel like this book was primarily published so that the author could show his work off. And there's nothing wrong with that, he's certainly an amazing photographer, but it's not really what I wanted to be paying for. I'm happy for him and his amazing career as an instructor and photographer, but this book just doesn't cut it if you have access to the internet."
4,Good,"Good pointers and pictures that are instructive. Book covers a little bit of everything, but you will take away some points.I just bought my first DSLR camera. I bought ten photography books on amazon. I'm evaluating these books from the perspective of a semi-advanced amateur. (On things I've learnt is that book by the same author tends to be very similar. So make sure you vary your authors when buying more than one book. Rather than saying this author is good, let me buy more from him/her.)"
4,Great Book for All Amateur Photographers,"This book is a classic and the reputation and stellar reviews below are well deserved. The concepts of Apeture, Shutter Speed, Light are all explained very clearly to provide a good understanding of exposure. The author stresses that you should not only seek to obtain the correct exposure for a photograph, but also the creatively correct one and provides bountiful examples and ideas for doing so. The book is very well organized and has multiple examples in full color on each page. The revised version continues to film photography for those who still use that medium."
5,Excellent book - every photographer should own a copy!,"This is an excellent book. In fact, I need to read it again. At first, some of the lingo may be over your head if you are just getting into photography but it's well worth the read. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in photography - it's one of the best books out there!"
1,Its over two Weeks Have not received it!,I contacted the sell who gave me a tracking number they must have used the cheapest way possible to send it because I have not received it as of yet.
3,Good book!,"This book is not for a beginner DSLR camera user, you definitely have to have experience with your camera to understand this book."
5,The 'cure' for exposure confusion,"No photographer young or old, professional or amateur should leave their home without this valuable tool at their disposal. The author explains everything in easy to understand detail about the mechanics and process of exposure and manual mode with your camera. I learned more in 15 minutes of skimming this book than a weeks worth of internet research. DO NOT THINK OF NOT ORDERING THIS BOOK!"
5,Great Book for Users,"I purchased this book after reading reviews and having people suggest this literature to me. I have to say that the author makes it very straightforward, concise and comfortable to read. For a amateur photographer, this book is a gem and I highly suggest reading it just to familiarize yourself with the basic conceps of exposure and how you apply it to both digital and film photography."
5,hobbyist necessity!,"Relatively new to photography, no formal training, taking my first photography class next spring at community college :) this book was easy to read, read entire book in one sitting, while keep my camera at my side to experiment.Bryan Peterson definitely knows his stuff and it really brought me to the next level in my photography. Many times in this book, I keep thinking, ""ahh huh!"" and my eyes opened wider and would realize I just became a better, smarter photographer because of the paragraph I just read.Talks about aperture, shutter speed, ISO, putting them all together, light, book is full of great examples, before/after pictures, crops of pictures of exactly where the author is metering the light, etc. There is little or no hand waiving in the book!Awesome, 5 stars! worth every penny."
1,Um.....no,"If your brand new to serious photography and want good, solid, quick tips on shooting better THIS WEEKEND go for ""The Digital Photography 1,2,and 3 books. Good info quickly given..(a bit of crappy humor mixed in but oh well)..If you want a wordy graphic novel about exposure then here you go.I'm the odd man out here I guess but this book, ""A must read"" I'm told...did me no good!This guy has some great video's...watch those and save some time."
5,From an Amateur DSLR Photographer,"This book, though a little on the expensive side, provides excellent examples and explications of the tools and techniques of photography. If you are brand new to the field of creative photography, or you are looking to improve your creativity by really understanding the technical aspects of your camera, this is an excellent book. Bear in mind, however, it is a little difficult to absorb in a singular reading, as it may take a while to digest the material. Specifically, the allegory the author employs to explain the relationship of aperture, film speed, and shutter speed is the best I have encountered.An excellent book, and certainly worth the money."
5,Great teaching book on the basics of SLR photography,"For both beginner and early-intermediate photographers, this book explains the mechanical operations of the camera and tells the reader HOW those operations affect the outcome of their pictures.With practical advice and hands-on practice lessons, Bryan really helps his readers take the next step in true photography."
1,Far from my expectations.,This book wont make you a better photographer for sure. It did not answer main question - how to shoot?
2,For beginners only,"I was a little stingy with my rating, because, to be honest, i was disappointed. If you understand the basics of film speed, shutter speed & aperture (he calls it ""the triangle"") there is little to gain from this book. If you are a complete beginner, please change that rating to 3 stars.About the only thing i found slightly interesting in this book was the discussion about depth of field, but this was nothing new to me either.The GLARING DEFICIENCY in this book is a total failure to discuss anything about the use of flash or artificial light. If you have even heard the phrase ""fill flash"" you will be disappointed with this book. This book covers natural light ONLY!Henderson (below) is right.... is that it??"
2,Purely basics,"I bought this thinking it would have a lot of in depth information about exposure. However I went through the book within 30 minutes and did not find anything new or quite interesting. It's a very basic book in understanding the importance of ISO, shutter speed, and aperture and how they work together. Not really much past that. I would definitely recommend this to beginner's, but if you want to save a few bucks you can learn all the information provided in this book via online resources, just use your favorite search engine ;)Was also kind of upset that they mentioned anything about digital cameras seeing as how there was maybe 4 pages at the end of the book that talked about irrelevant fluff."
5,Excellent Book,"Excellent excellent book to learn from. Some parts of it are kind of technical for newbies (like me), but after taking the book outside with me and practising with my camera and the book at my side, it began to make sense. I've learned alot from reading this book. Would definately recommend it to beginner to enthusiast level photograpers."
5,I will make this simple for you...,"Don't waste time and money reading book after book looking for ""recipes"" for good pictures. Don't waste time and money reading old-school pre-digital photographers guidebooks and textbooks on how cameras work. I could go on and on...Just skip to this book.It's that easy. For years I searched for a book like this. If you understand exposure, you can finally have the skill to shoot the vision in your head. Photography doesn't have to be so much trial and error. There is a way and this book teaches the path."
3,For Newbies only. Lacks depth.,After reading all the rave reviews I was disappointed when the book arrived. It's very general and brief. I was looking for something more than just colorful examples of broad photographic principles.
3,Decent book for beginners,"It's an overall decent book with informative techniques and tips. The photos themselves are not spectacular, but they are not meant to impress and instead teach about the concepts. He does have a few very striking photos in the book which speaks about the author's creative talent. The book is slightly ruined by his elaboration on how much money he made off certain photos, and uncomfortable descriptives about his wife. Also, he overuses the term ""who cares"" aperture. I know it sounds cool and irreverent to say ""who cares"" but since the ""who cares"" aperture seems to have been used quite frequently, I'd say it is an aperture to care about. To be fair, he has a whole column on the f8 to f11 aperture which completely makes sense. The author also writes about little tricks (making fake rain) and mention very helpful tips (the brother skies). Coupled with his photographic examples, the author is successful in conveying his message."
4,Met expectations,The book came in a reasonable amount of time and was in good condition. Would do business again.
4,Very specific information for teaching techniques.,"I can't say I was disappointed in the book as it gave me a great deal of ""exposure"" information. This book is great for explaining the types of exposure shots you are capable of achieving. Putting that knowledge to use might be a little difficult until a person gains some experience with their camera. Shows great examples of exposure techniques, and the pictures are fantastic. Handy reference tool for later on, when I'm ready to take it all in."
3,Best thing about the book is the cover photo.,Very disappointed in the book. Best thing about it is the cover photo. Basic info. covered which I already knew and rather scant info. at that. You could read the whole book in just a couple of hours (I did).
2,Out of Date Book,"This was once a very good introduction to exposure for beginners. Alas the years go by and the book is seriously out of date. The concepts are still correct and somewhat useful. However, the book was written before the advent of serious digital cameras and before Photoshop and other programs were available to improve images. I think that if one looks at the dates of all the glowing reviews, you would see that they were written some time ago. I would look for a more up to date discussion of exposure."
4,I see the light . . .,"This book has really helped me understand exposure more clearly. One of the most difficult aspects of photography has been exposure. This book has helped me ""see the light""!"
4,easy to understand,"A great book. Excellent first time introduction to the ""technicals"" of photography or for those who had let their knowledge slip. The photos are stunning and Bryan writes in a style that is entertaining and informative. Highly recommended to those interested in photography at the beginners level."
2,Very basic,"I ordered this book based on reviews on these pages. I expected a lot of information in this book and hints on how I could best use certain camera settings in certain situations. And although this book does give some very nice beginners information, it nowhere nearly gives me all the answers I expected. The writer makes some errors in what aperture he used and he makes some very strange analogies to explain things. He compares ISO values with bees carrying waterbuckets.. what the...!?I'm also not very sure for whom this book is written. It's definitely not for the pro, and as a matter of fact I believe that beginners will only get confused by reading this book. I think I'll sell it as soon as I can."
5,Great book for beginners,"Beautiful pictures, great tips & trick. I have this to accompany the Scott Kelby books Digital Photography Vol 1 & 2. I recommend all of them"
5,A learners bible to photography,"This book is fantastic! I already had solid knowledge and understanding of photography before purchasing this book and I must admit, this book is really great! Not only does it look at the technical aspects of making a correct exposure, it also gives you same more creative ways to look at taking various shots. A must have for any enthusiast photographer!"
5,Easy to Read and Understand,This book is a great primer to get you started understanding how exposure effects your photographs and how to take more control over your photos and make them more interesting.
4,A must have for the student of phtotography,"Well written, concise overview of the most important concept of photography...""proper exposure"" and how to ""get there"" !"
2,Pretty Basic -,"If you bought a DSLR and dont know anything about photography, this would be OK. If you have been around photography awhile, don't waste your money. The author seems impressed that he could learn some basic concepts and pass them on - that is how the writting style comes across."
4,Good communication,"The item took a while to get here (3 wks) the USPS lost the first shipment but the seller contacted me early and often to make sure the one he re-sent got to me. It was a bit bent up when it got here but I doubt it was the seller's fault. Great seller, maybe not the best shipping method."
3,This version/printing is too small,"I really liked this book when I got it from the library, which must have had an older version or printing. The book I received was about the size of a piece of paper. The photos aren't nearly as helpful when they're so small. It's a great book, but given that it's a photography book it's kind of waste to make it so small. Try to get an older, larger printing."
4,Very good for understanding exposure,"If you are a beginner in photography and wants to go a step further, this is a very good book. It explains all there is about, exposure (aperture, speed, ISO,...).Simple, light and with lots of examples."
3,fluffy,i bought this book partially because many ppl recommended it. I have to say it was disappointing. The pictures were fantastic however the information was sparse. There's like 5-6 pages worth of information the rest of the few hundred pgs are fluff. There are other better books that will cover the info in this book and more.
2,Only helpful if you are a beginner,"It may have just been me, but the book seems really basic. If you are like me, you read for hours online about photography; you know Digital Photography Schools inside and out, and have read countless tutorials. I feel like paying for this book taught me little I did not already know by reading dps. It is good information but you should be warned not to buy it if you read online."
5,An excellent way to learn,This book is excellent in the way that the lessons are exposed. Very easy to understand and apply. Very well done!
3,Understanding Exposure,"This book is an easy read with plentiful illustrations and good use of white space. its target is the amateur making the change from 'point and shoot' cameras using full automatic exposure to manual, thoughtful exposures. While it won't tell you how to shoot great exposures it will show you how to get proper exposures in many varied situations."
3,A little too basic,"The book is good, it tells you how to properly expose for different scenarios and effects but its explained too much. Its aimed for begginers so it can be a little boring for the ones that already know the basics. The pictures in the book look old and I didnt like that. Overall its a good book for learning from scratch or maybe catch a few extra tips that you may not already know as an intermediate photographer."
4,A very good read.,"After reading this book, I feel much calmer and more focused about what I am doing both with the camera, and about whatever scene I am presented with in front of it.This book removes a lot of the 'clutter' that can run around inside ones head while planning how to shoot a scene. By catagorizing certain shooting opportunities into a logical series of decisions that simplify the technical side, not only do you get the image you want, but it allows you to imagine the same scene in a variety of ways.The night photography section posed more questions than it provided answers for me, but on the whole, as a foundation for understanding exposure and getting you mind on the right track from the start, this book is very good indeed."
5,Feel like a photographic grown-up,"Peterson delivers on his premise: ""Learning to see the multitude of creative exposures that exist is a giant leap toward photographic maturity.""Finally! I just counted 12 other how-to photography books on my self. I've learned from them all and from workshops by pros with award-winning work, so I came with an intellectual understanding of aperture, shutter speed, and ISO and their relationship to each other. This is the book that helped me jump from intellectual understanding to instinctual control and creative choice.Understanding Exposure cuts through the jargon with concise explanations and just enough analogy, simile, and stories to make it stick. Peterson illustrates each point with his own beautiful and to-the-point photographs, often with alternate photos and settings so you can see the results of different choices. Read this book, do the exercises, and feel like a photographic grown-up."
3,Very good beginners digital photo how-to book,I bought this book because a professional photographer friend recommended it for a beginner digital photo'er. It's good and has a lot of explanation of terms and how to take certain photos that you see and want to reproduce.
5,Excellent Book,This book worked wonders for a beginner like me! I'm not a professional but I now have a basic knowledge of my dSLR.
4,understanding but still lost,this book helps alot when it comes to the effects of exposure in photography. I'm still lost though. I can't seem to get my camera off the automatic setting yet. The book shows what happens at different settings it even gives examples of subtle changes. It clearly shows the results of changing the exposure settings and demonstrates alot of photos where the exposure is just OK but how to get the same photo to POP by adjusting exposure settings.
4,Good book!,"This book explains Aperture, Shutter Speed, ISO in a very simple matter. He explains the shot he was going for and then he tells you why he chose the settings he used. I keep it with me and muse over the pictures and try to duplicate the story.. Works for me!"
4,"I understand aperture, shutter speed and ISO now","This book is excellent. I give it 4 stars because it didn't cover ISO THAT well for my understanding. Granted, it's a lot simpler than aperture and shutter speed, but I finished not really being sure when to use which ISO. Other than that the book is a must have. Highly recommended. The quality is incredible like others have said. I'm going to try Exposure and Lighting for Digital Photographers Only by Meadhra and Lowrie next."
2,Disappointing,"After all the praise I'd read about this book, I bought a copy (and quickly resold it).Nominally this is a 160 page book, but many of those pages are filled with the author's photos, and like a copy of Byte there's relatively little actual text. What text there is belies the 2004 date or the claim that it's updated: despite the occasional token reference to digital photography, this is a book about shooting film with 1980's technology, and is additionally biased toward landscapes. The author is big on focus-then-recompose shooting, which is much less feasible when shooting, say, humans than it is for mountains and distant tree silhouettes. The techniques advocated range from being inefficient with today's (or even 2004's) modern cameras to being inappropriate for modern dense digital sensors.There is a modest to moderate amount of common-knowledge content, but an hour spent with a web browser will give the reader that and more without all the anachronisms."
4,Understanding Exposure - Bryan Peterson,"Well writen, easy to understand and clearifies confusions about exposure. Great example shots."
4,vary helpful,"full of tips, easy to read, great for beginners, shows pics and the settings used to take the pis, author is a nikon user but the book covers other camers not to say the book is only for nikon users this book is for any one needing to know about exposure"
4,Good Book,A good book for amateur photographers.Tells the photography aspects in detail and in depth.
4,A great book even for experienced amateurs,"This book is obviously written for a wide audience with different equipment that includes film cameras, basic digital cameras (but possessing some type of manual control) and advanced digital SLRs. There were many useful points throughout the book covering the intelligent usage of shutter speed, aperture and metering. Concisely he reviews the basics of each and builds on them so that even an advanced amateur such as myself with my trusty Nikon D100 will have gained a greatly improved usage of each. The one downside to the book was the writing style was sometimes too simplistic and Mr. Peterson tried to cover too broad an audience. I highly recommend this book."
2,OK but not great,"I bought this book based on the reviews here and recommendations from photography message groups. This book gives insight to exposure but it is basic, really basic. BUT the biggest issue that I had was that it seemed that in every situation, I should setup a tripod, adjust aperature and shutter speed manually. That may work for advanced or professional photographers but not someone that doesn't have a half an hour to take a picture. I also needed a book that gave me quick insights to how to set up a picture for taking pictures in dark environments. I found that I prefered John Hedgecoe's new manual of photography."
4,"Good information, but a little dry...","This book has good information for the novice to intermediate photographer abouut exposure, but it reads a little dry. I have tended to skip through the chapters looking for certain topics rather than reading from beginning to end, as it does not lend itself to sitting down and reading that way.The information presented in the book is very helpful, however, and I have gained a lot from the lessons I have learned so far..."
2,Very Disappointed! The concept of exposure should NOT BE LIMITED to outdoor photography. NO mention of flash concepts!,"I was very disappointed in the book and will be returning it. My book had a copyright date of 2004 and was a ""revised edition"". The author talks about taking a ""creative correct exposure"" but he severely limits the concept to outdoor photography. Aperture, shutter speed and ISO are only the beginning. The book DOES NOT address flash photography. The word ""flash"" does not even appear in the index. Understanding how and when to use a flash, indoor or outdoor, is a very important concept in taking creative correct exposures. I was left with many unanswered questions after reading this book. To summarize the book; take pictures in manual mode and learn how to use the camera's exposure meter. Search the internet for more information and save your money."
5,A great learning experience,"With ""Understanding Exposure"", Bryan Peterson gives the amateur photographer an indispensable tool and learning guide. With the help of full color photos taken with different settings as well as clear and concise descriptions and explanations of technique mr Peterson gives the reader an easily understandable introduction to the world of exposure.Because of the great detail in which the different photo situations and techniques are covered it is indeed very easy to go out and reproduce the photos from the book (well, that kind of photo anyway) yourself after reading.This book gave me much more knowledge about photography than I would have expected it possible. It definitely helped me progress as a photographer.Highly recommendable."
5,Learning Photography,"With this book, and because of this book I can easily say I take better pictures. I own a Canon G10. I got sick of owning a $500 camera that I never took of Auto Mode. After buying this book, I planned on doing a cross country drive. Stopping at the Grand Canyon, Colorado River, doing some hiking in Utah. After reading this book, I learned how to operate my camera in Manual, how shutter speed, ISO, Aperture go hand in hand with each other. Learning this, I've taken some amazing shots that I will gladly hold on to for the rest of my life. It might have been luck of the draw, but while I was changing the dials to make sure I was getting the correct exposure, I can't help but think it's this book that helped me understand it all.A million times thank you."
5,Photography made simple,"This book was definitely worth the money. The author simplifies complicated concepts and through innumerable examples, he makes the reader understand when andd where to use which modes. It wont make you a pro overnight, but it will definitely give you insight into becoming a better photographer.The examples he uses are very simple in terms of analogy so it makes the concepts very easy to understand. His pictures also give you ideas of what you can photograph and does make you a bit more creative. Overall I couldnt be happier with the purchase, the pictures are very good quality in full color and there are pictures on pretty much every page and take up quite a bit of the page thus you can see the results of his expertise. If you have an SLR and are a biggener or want a little bit more insight, this is the book for you!"
2,Err .. is that it?,"I ordered this book based on the rave reviews it gets here, and elsewhere. I was looking forward to reading it, thinking it was going to help me improve my photography, master difficult lighting etc. So, when it arrived, I eagerly unpacked it, sat down to read and ... err, is that it?Essentially it is a very basic beginners book. Probably for beginners its fine, but once you've figured out the elements of depth of field, and the idea that metering will not provide the optimum exposure in all cases, there's not much else.If you're new to photography, take a look. If you've read any other books, or taken a few rolls of film, look elsewhere."
2,"Good book, but out of date","This book comes highly recommended by pro photographers. It is a very decent book, but not one that will answer every of your questions. But I doubt there is such a book or CD-ROM."
3,average,"i didn't find this book THAT helpful, it's about average.it's definitely not the type of book that if you read it, you will know everything that you need to know on exposure and aperture. which in my opinion makes it worthless to have. why do i want endless incomplete books on my shelf in order to understand this triangle."
1,Unacceptable Product,"I ordered this item expecting a full, professional, in depth exposition of photographic exposure. Instead I received a glossy, superficial product. I did not keep it a day, giving it away to a library."
5,Came highly recommended!,"This book was recommended by several people I know. I have been taking pictures for years but never really understood ""photography."" I bought this book hoping that it would help me understand what correct exposure means and how to do it myself without relying on the cameras auto mode. It is a great book, really did help me figure it all out. Doesn't mean I am an expert now but its a great stepping stone from just taking pictures to really capturing a moment and making pictures that I think are beautiful to look at."
3,Great info for the quickshot amateur but not made for the pro,"This book is a must-buy if you're an amatuer looking for quick and easy tips on how to expose common situations correctly. Nevertheless, it does not teach you the underlying principles that have to do with exposure leaving you quite helpless when faced with any situation that shifts from the norm therein explained. The books title is somewhat decieving, because in the end you don't really understand exposure as much as you adequately reproduce all its easy-to-learn rules. ""Understanding exposure"" would really require other more technical and in-depth books."
4,Must have basic book,I just start ready this manual on exposure. It is well writing so the average Joe can understand the concept the author is teaching. You even have homework to apply the concept.
3,Depth of field examples,"I've first edition: This book should be called ""how to choose best shutter speed with your automatic camera and depth of field examples"".Author doesn't explain light measuring... The most important thing when setting exposure. How to correctly measure incident light, how to work with the spot meter, how useful the sunny 16 rule can be. The author mostly relies only on the automatic metering system and that's the problem when the title says 'Exposure'. If you don't plan to use camera's manual mode to set the exposure by yourself then it could be the book for you."
5,Underexposure or Overexposure,"This book rates right up at the top of the ladder regarding understanding exposure. The author Bryan Peterson shows the practical aspects of exposure as relates to shooting great photographs. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in digital photography. BILL RHYNE, Am Photo Man"
1,"Book is NOT about ""Exposure""","When you buy a book titled ""Understanding Exposure"" you would expect most of the book to talk just about that!!This is a decent book as far as pictures and general 101 photography info - especially if you are a ""35mm type"" - but it does a pathetic job talking about ""exposure"" (i.e. metering a scene, using a light meter, zone systems, etc.).This is is NOT what it purports to be...Very disappointing."
3,Inspiring but flawed,"I had borrowed the previous edition from the library and decided to put this book on my wishlist. It arrived, and it is inspiring and teaching me a few things. However, I can't give this book 5 or even 4 stars because it contains a number of things I find confusing, and a few that are plain wrong (check out his definition of 'specular highlight' and compare it to anyone else's, for example - I can only assume he meant to say 'bokeh' instead)."
3,Getting me through it,"I need to get out with the book, its a little big to travel with but its worth the buy."
2,Quite basic,The book provides a generic introduction to photography for what regards light. Of particular interest the emphasis put in picture comprising slices of sky suggesting invariably to expose for the sky in most daylight situations.
2,It was okay,I guess unless you are in the classroom enviornment then it isn't really helpful. I thought I understood it and tried to tweak my camera settings and it was a big mess... so I think I will stick to Auto until I know for SURE what I am doing.It did teach me a couple things that I was interested in doing though.
3,good on exposure but seemed to add digital as an afterthought,I enjoyed the book and learned a lot however I was disapointed on the digital -The book seemed to be written for the film camera user and then it appears that he went back and added some comments for the digital user.
2,Not really about understanding exposure,"This book came recommended by a number of people as a great book to help you understand exposure, just as the title implies. However, it doesn't really help a photographer understand exposure, it just tells the photographer to use the program modes and viola, that's a ""correct"" exposure. There is no real discussion on what makes an exposure ""correct"" other than the electronics in the camera--aka what someone else decided is correct. This book does not really encourage experimentation with understanding what exposure will convey the artistic message you as the photographer are trying to convey. Also, many of the example photographs in the book need to be updated/modernized."
1,There are better books...,"Too many errors, a condescending (almost insulting) writing style, inconsistencies, and a lack of real information make this book hardly worth reading. It would be difficult to know about these problems without reading the book first so I hope this review will give some insight into these issues.The book is probably aimed at beginners yet those are the ones who can least afford to get bad information. Those who already know about exposure can see the errors for themselves but the beginners will read this and think this is the real goods. It is not.There are far better books from which to learn about exposure, among them: Ansel Adams ""The Negative"" and ""The Camera"" and Alain Briot's ""Mastering Landscape Photography"".Peterson's book is highly rated and my guess is the rave reviews are from those new to exposure, who don't know they are being shortchanged."
2,A Map Without Any Roads,"If I had to sum up this book in one sentence I would describe it as ""A map without any roads"".The title is misleading because there is no real ""How To"" involved in this book. If the author's goal was to say ""Hey! Look at my pictures and the setting I used to get them"" then he has succeeded. The rest of the books are some sectioned off background information to help the reader to understand the images better.The reason this book gets a 2 instead of a 1 is because there are some really nice images in the book. I was going to give it a 3 but then I just remembered how the author was breaking his arm patting himself on the back when ever there was an image of his wife & kids involved instead of leaving them anonymous like the other subjects.As far as teaching, you would receive better information from the person working at the local camera shop."
5,Fantastic Book,"I love it. Very clear in both word and explanation. The pictures are so tied in with the written word it is so easy to comprehend what the author is trying to tell us.The first book that clearly explains all of the details behind good, no great, photography. I learned so much from this book. I look forward to more books written by this author."
5,Written with Knowledge and Passion,This book is wonderful.Beautiful pictures. Easy to understand and to learn from. A joy to read.
4,A very practical guide on exposure,A very useful guide on how to achieve optimal exposure. Easy to read. Techniques easy to apply.
4,Understanding Exposure,This is a great book on how exposure works. It has tips and tricks on how to get the right exposure the first time. I would reccommend it for any photographer from the beginner who wants to learn about exposure to the pro who needs a refresher on exposure.
4,Open-ended discovery,"This puzzle is both relaxing and challenging. Younger children can use an assortment of puzzle pieces to make shapes or follow the puzzle structure on a smaller scale. To increase the difficulty, use all of the pieces to make a square (or rectangle) where the edges of each piece match the pieces beside it. For a further challenge, make a diagonal line or a border around the edge using solid colour. This is VERY tricky!"
4,Just found my Christmas present to myself :),"Okay, so when I was out at the bookstore trying to find a $5 item to add to my son's $20 so that he could get a free bear with $25 purchase, I found this game. Immediately I was drawn to it and knew I had to have it. It's been years since I've put puzzles together - puzzles kept me busy daily as a child. This is similar to a puzzle, but yet not. It's much more addictive! We sat down as a family tonight to play it, and found that it makes you frustrated, it makes you laugh, it makes you think, and it lets you have fun all at the same time. Of course my husband and son gave up but I had to sit and try and try and try to finish it - which I still haven't done yet! But you'd better believe this is one game that I can't put down :) I'll return to it tomorrow to try and finish it again. And after telling a few of my friends about it, they went out and bought some for Christmas gifts - I'm thinking I'll probably do the same!"
2,defective toy??,I had a friend recommend Izzi but the box we got seems to be defective. The game consists of little cardboard squares. I think our set was not cut properly. There is a tiny line of black next to a lot of the white cards. So we weren't sure if we play the card as if it is white (and the black is barely there because it was not cut properly) or if it really has a black edge. We get into too many debates and it ruins the whole game.
4,Good puzzle for visual perception & patterns,"My kids aren't obsessed with this puzzle game (hence only 4 stars, lol), but it's a good way to occupy their minds for a spell, and helps my one child build her visual spatial skills, which is something we work on with her. Nice to have a ""fun"" thing to accomplish vision therapy goals! The kids often just make cool designs with the squares, which isn't really the goal of the game, but isn't a bad thing. :-)The pieces are rather thin cardboard, so if it was a game they played a lot, I suspect durability might be an issue."
5,Child's first lesson in business?,"Ginger and Pickles, a cat and dog who run a dry goods store are failing in business by giving unlimited credit. Their sales are enormous but there is never any money in the till. They restrain their natural desire to eat their rodent customers and sustain themselves by consuming inventory. Finally, they are forced to close the store when they cannot pay the annual tax bill. The store is later reopened by an enterprising chicken who gets a little flustered counting change, but nevertheless brings the story to a happy ending."
2,An okay book,"If I had paid for this kindle book I would be completely disappointed! It is a short story but feels like it goes on forever. Overall the best part of the story is when Ginger and Pickles discuss their frustration on not eating the customers. Overall boring. It also mentions them selling snuff a few times. My children kept asking me what snuff was. That was the only part of the story that stood out to them. My nine year old didn't want me to finish the story and my four year old kept interrupting. Not worth keeping, we deleted it. But it is great that there are free kindle books, I guess when you download free books you will get a few duds once in awhile."
2,Dull and Half Pretty,"My children have Peter Rabbit in the same format. The story of Ginger and Pickles is dull. My children who will sit through chapters of books were up and gone before we even got halfway through Ginger and Pickles. Some of the pictures are beautiful. Many are just simple sketches, with no color. I was hoping for another treasured classic, since they love Peter Rabbit, but this one was definitely a dud. The book looks pretty sitting on the shelf, but that is where it stays."
5,Two thums up for you IQ,"Very very good cd, IQ wasn't one of my favorite band in the early days.Since the album ""Ever"", fourteen years ago, they have done really great prog albums and ""Dark Matter"" is one of the best album of the band. From the beginning to the end, this cd is full of powerful music, great transitions, good feelings and melodic instrumentation as we, prog music fans, really like. Highly recommanded. A jewel in my cd collection."
4,Kings of 7/8s did it again...,"Yes, they did it again. With the vast majority written in 7/8 there is consistency and recognition in this new IQ album for existing fans. Harvest of Souls (an epic indeed) is too long and wears relatively thin on musival ideas, with the obligatory final guitar solo lacking originality. You Never Will and the opening track clearly make up for some of the 'i have heard this before' feeling that falls upon the listener over time. Still highly recommended for prog fans in general and IQ fans in particular. Perhaps Mr. Cook left, because he got bored with the 7/8 rhythm..."
4,Fairly Decent,"Never heard of this band, but after reading many glowing reviews I decided to purchase this CD. The first thing I noticed was Peter Nicholls vocals was reminiscent of Joe Walsh. Also, the production/engineering is outstanding, all instruments blend well to provide a full and rich soundscape... the tone of the bass guitar is fabulous and audible!! After several listens, one could compare some of the riffs to early Genesis or Pink Floyd. Specifically, ""Born Brilliant"" sounds similar to the guitar work on Foxtrot or Nursery Cryme. The songs are good; the musicianship great, at times the music gets repetitive, but otherwise a decent CD."
3,Decent- Some good Songs 2-1/2 Stars,"This band is a TAD overhyped- this album being considered for prog album of the year?? I think not. The 24 minute ""epic"" track Harvest of Souls puts me to sleep- the ending is good- if I make it that far. Oh and the lyrics- DONT LIKE THEM"
2,"For those who are new to IQ, read on","I picked up this album after reading over the reviews since it was also recommended by amazon. Obviously by my rating, I was not very impressed. I was introduced to progressive rock by Dream Theater about 15 years ago and until recently, I'm embarassed to admit, I didn't realize there was a genre called 'progressive rock'. The musicianship of IQ is good but I was hoping for something to grab me. The whole album is much more laid back and melodic than I expected. The over all tempo is - and hopefully this makes sense - trapped in between soft rock and your normal every day rock. As far as songs go, they seemed to meld into one another. In other words, no one song stood out as the leader of the pack. This cd wasn't really to my liking but if what I described fits your fancy, go for it - you'll love it.For those of you who are looking for a review and are already fans, I'm afraid I can't be much help to you in regards to comparing this album to others."
5,Awsome Progessive,"I.Q. is an amazing band in a class by itself. If you are into progressive music you have to get this album, it will take your music library to a new level."
3,"Fast, Loud and Urgent Hardcore","Fast, Loud and Urgent HardcoreThis CD is thirteen tracks of relentless traditional hardcore music accompanied by urgent screaming vocals. Suggestive of a cross between YOUTH OF TODAY and SICK OF IT All, these energetic songs are reminiscent of the late 80's Hardcore sound. Some of the tracks get lost in the CD's aggressive musical repetition. The catchy sing along chorus of Can't Break Me stands out the most among the other tracks. It's melodies are contagious and the strongest on the album. Over all, the CD is pretty good."
4,Best of its type,This is the best book yet written on a very difficult and divisive subject. It is very practical in its approach; and though it does not promise or deliver any miracles it provides a solid game plan for beginning a journey to make your relationships- and your life-better.
4,"A highly personal, finely-shaded book of prose and poems","Tillamook Burn is a series of poems and short prose pieces centering around the childhood and adolescence of Albert Drake, who grew up in the Pacific Northwest during the 1930s and 1940s, and offers a series of vignettes that are not highly detailed but are highly evocative, calling forth images of faded sepia-tone photos of times and places long past. Themes include his memories of his father, the Second World War, and studies of the forgotten characters of the period, and ultimately Drake uses these images to paint a transition between his boyhood view of his father to his eventually becoming similar in many ways to his father. I first read this in the back of a '64 Ford traveling east from Michigan in 1980, and have a copy from which I still quote."
2,difficult to use,"We ordered two of these bottles for an upcoming camping trip that was going to require us to filter our drinking water. The bottles turned out to be difficult to use and one didn't work at all. I assumed from the pictures and the pop-up ""straw"" that we'd be able to drink from the bottles. Instead you have to squeeze the bottle from the base to get the water out of the straw - and it takes a lot of pressure to get it out. It's definitely a 2-handed firm squeeze to get water from these."
3,Not Very Good,"The book's tolerable. Essentially, the problem with it boils down to shallowness: the characters are merely caricatures, the dialog is banal, and the plot has no depth. If I had actually bought this book instead of borrowing it from the library, I'd probably be more upset about it. As it is, it was just a waste of time reading it. I find this amazing since all the other Ender/Bean books of this era are excellent. I don't know what happened with this book, but don't bother reading it."
3,A New Thread for Card,"Shadow Puppets is another installment in the Ender's Game series by Orson Scott Card. It takes place after the battle with the Buggers and deals primarily with Bean, Peter Wiggin and some of Ender's other battle school cohorts. All now in positions of power either by their own finangling or by the sheer weight of being battle school graduates the children are all vying for power. You should know this is more of a political and intrigue styled book and is as much a departure from the original Ender's Game as Children of the Mind Xenocide, etc were. However, it is good work by Card and worth a read."
1,Cards Religion on Display,Where are the charachters from the first two books? Where did the relationship of Bean and Petra come from? Why is a teenage girl obsessed with child birth to the point of endangering her own life? Why is Card writing about a 14 year old boy having sex and getting a girl pregnant?It seems that either Card was forced to write a diminished story due to publishing pressures. Or he had to write about the joys of unrestricted reproduction to apease his mormon fans. Either way this was a horible book that was ruined for me as soon as Petra started nagging Bean to father her children. Card seems to have lost his way and I for one will not be buying his next offering.
2,The Bean saga sputters and fades...,"Like Children of the Mind, the least of the original Ender series, Shadow Puppets marks a point where Mr. Card has either lost interest in his characters or inspiration to continue the series. The drop in quality since Shadow of the Hegemon is precipitous. While reading, I was surprised by how uninvolved I often felt.That's not to say the book doesn't have its fun moments. The scene featuring a depressed Peter Wiggin right before a potentially career-ending press conference is hilarious, and the climax is fairly exciting. Yet the rest of the book is crushed by an overemphasis on babymaking (sure Bean and Petra are exceptional, but they're still teenagers), and the spark that makes you race through Mr. Card's earlier works is curiously absent.Still, fans of the Ender and Bean novels might as well read this book. Though the series seems lifeless now, the story still isn't over. A future volume detailing Bean's demise may be worth waiting for."
2,Falls far from the tree...,"I think few have expectations that this book or series measure up to Ender's Game. I started reading the new series with Ender's Shadow which was actually pretty good, but Shadow Puppets and Shadow of the Hegemon have been disappointments. The great thing about Ender's Game was that it was a book about kids, but you were able to suspend your disbelief that little kids were saving the world. Card fails to do that in these installments."
2,Seriously lacking...,"I have been a fan of Orson Scott Card for years and have ready everything that he has written. Unfortunately this book is a serious disappointment in both plot and, more pointedly, in dialogue. As the Battle School children are getting older they sound more and more like spoiled children. Card should focus on his ""genius child"" theme and avoid the children as they grow up, and should certainly avoid trying to write romance in any way shape or form. Of course, even with this book being a bomb and it looking like the entire series has fizzled out, I still would recommend reading this book if you have gotten this far in the series. You wont like it, but how could you avoid reading it?"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Stop the Evil Genius.Bean and Peter Wiggin still have to work to counter the rather psychopathic tendencies of their classmate Achilles, while Bean and Petra have to decide what to do ethically about their possibilities for child rearing.The rest of the Battle School will also be busy with the global political situation destabilising.This book is definitely not as interesting as some of the others in the Ender Saga."
3,Enders Game Over & Out,"Enough already...Ender's Game & Ender's Shadow are both great books which are destined to become classics.Everything in this series that comes after is just plain tedious.Shadow puppets should be renamed Machiavelli in Space or The Prince & the Hedgemon.Don't get me wrong; O.S. Card is obviously brilliant but come on, where's the action?"
1,Not worth its price,I bought this ebook thinking that this book would have better than average quality. I feel that the author is stealing my money by selling an inferior product. I won't be buying any of Mr. Scott Cards ebook that don't have at least a 5 star rating.Thats why it's important that you rate and review all of the Kindle ebooks that you buy.
2,Achilles returning to the Hegemony is the moment this series jumped the shark.,Not since Anakin and Padme has a romance been more boring or still-born.This is the last book in the Ender Series that I will ever bother reading.
3,Less Appealing Modern World Political Backdrop,"While I'm still enjoying following the future of the characters of Ender's Shadow and Ender's Game, I'm not really enjoying the setting. Contemporary-feeling world politics and war just aren't working for me. It's like a juvenile version of Tom Clancy or Robert Ludlum. I'm such a fan of the characters, I'm afraid that I'm in for the long haul, but sequels should be good enough that you'd want to read them on their own for their stories, and Shadow Puppets falls short of that for me."
2,Going down hill fast,"I liked Ender's Game, and was ho-hum on the rest of the Ender series.I loved Ender's Shadow, and thought Shadow of the Hegemon was good.I did not care for Shadow Puppets much at all. The entire Peter Wiggin part of the story is awful! Is this the same character as in the previous books? The character who's clear thinking, logic, ability to appeal to the emotions of the people captivated the population with essays and arguments using the pseudonyms Locke and Demosthenes? No! This Peter Wiggin is extraordinarily self doubting, highly immature, and emotional. Strangely, after masterminding Locke and Demosthenes and always being a few steps ahead of everyone, he now can almost not make a move without help, consultation, an enormous amount of prodding, and a great deal of whining.For me, it was mostly a waste of time and money. I will be buying the next in the series shortly and hoping it is much better."
2,Shadow Puppets is Right!,"Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are two of my most favorite books. This flimsy excuse for a book seemed like just another attempt by Card to cash in on the success of the rest of the franchise. I wonder if he realizes that while he may gain profits in the short term...in the long term it only serves to denigrate and hurt the whole series. I found the characters uninteresting as they seemed to really be puppets, acting out the desires of the author with no real sense of purpose or reason...other than thats where the author wanted to go. The plot was uninteresting and made me feel like I was watching a bad B (or C if there is such a thing) Sci-Fi movie.I am starting to wonder if William Shatner ""Shadow"" wrote this book. It's that bad. Don't waste your time."
4,pretty good book actually,i own this book and i loved the ender saga. this book solely revolves around bean and petra but is still a good book. i personally liked it because it had parts of what was going around in the world today in it. it could have been a little better but it is still ranked with 4 stars out of 5. a good book.
3,Really it should be a 2.5,"Well, let me begin with some praise first. I felt the first four books in the Enders Saga series were extremely interesting and well written. I very much enjoyed hearing of Enders life and the story just got better and better with every book.Then came along Enders Shadow. With this book I felt that Card did an interesting thing artistically by rewritting the first book but through another characters perspective. This I felt was quite unique and quite a good read.However, by the end of the sixth book I found Beans story to be drawn out...and by the 7th redundent. I felt that there was really no reason to have a 7th book. The plot could have ended by the end of the sixth.Now I wont lie, if Card publishes an eighth novel, I will read it. But...really, at that point, it can no longer be treated as part of Enders Saga...it will have become its own series.All in all, I felt the 7th book was ok. You cant give it a half a star, so I bumped up my rating to 3 (In honor of Ender)."
3,Shadow Puppets,"Shadow Puppets is the third book in the parallel series to Ender's Game. It is a book about the struggles of the Battle School Graduates to maintain world order and stop Achilles from conquering the world. Petra and Bean have come out of hiding and plan on having a kid without Anton's key. Except Achilles has stolen the embryos. This book is about how Bean, Petra, Peter and the rest of Ender's Dragon Army take their places in world government. In my opinion this book is not as good and Ender's Game or Ender's Shadow. It is much slower paced and did not hold me as tight as the previous books. It is still full of Card's moral dilemmas and ethical problems. It is a nice addition to the series and any hardcore fan of the series would have to read it. This book is for the slightly more advance readers and juggles several plots at once. A reader who enjoys higher thinking about ethics and morality would probably enjoy this book if he or she has read the preceding books."
4,Shadow Puppets is a worthy continuation,"Shadow Puppets is a worthy continuation of the Ender series. Shadow Puppets continues the saga started in Shadow of the Hegemon (apparently they were originally one book), where the Chinese have taken over half the world with the insane Achilles driving their strategy. Although the beginning of Shadow Puppets suffered the same weaknesses of SotH (namely the inclusion of Achilles), most of the story ignores him and introducing interesting new characters and plot points. I can definitely recommend Shadow Puppets to anyone reading the series."
4,A Good Book in a Good Series,Card's greatest gift is to create suspense from moral dilema. He is also very good at battle field planning. This book has a good measure of both.Ther storyline of this book is interesting and well crafted. It is not nescessary to have read the earlier books in the series to enjoy.Of particular note is his argument for having children.Well worth the read.caslo
4,This volume is... different from the others- but still good!,"Sure, some of the topics are slightly disturbing, but the book is still terrific! Yes. Bean and Petra get married and try to have kids. They do talk about trying to have kids too many times, but that's OK.If this review just made you kind of iffy on the book,know this: Bean gives Achilles some of his own medicine in this book. So it's still worth the read!"
1,"Shadow Puppets are very, very boring.","This book is excruicatingly bad. All the characters speak with the same exact style of voice. A half-formal, half-scarcastic (but never genuinely funny) monotone. Card's earlier works in the Ender series were great, with characters you can care about. Here, it feels like we're at a dinner party with George Lucas and Orson Scott Card talking about their past triumphs, revisiting them, and in the end ruining them through boredom and pretentiousness. I can't believe how much yapping there is about stupid political situations. It could have worked if they didn't sound utterly made up, with a ""And then the main characters were 100% right and guessed all the right answers"" tacked on at the end.And the audiobook version: The characters speak as if everything they say is super-important and must be said in a whiny whisper. Chapters are separated by the cheesiest music I have every heard this side of an elevator."
2,Mostly Tedious,"Like many of the other reviewers here, I find this series has steadily declined since the excellent ""Ender's Shadow."" In both ""Ender's Game"" and ""Ender's Shadow,"" Card managed to blend action, philosophy, heroism, and moral dilemma in powerful, yet subtle ways. He made us really care about Ender and Bean, and he kept the tension perfectly balanced. Unfortunately, all of the subtlety seems to have disappeared, along with much of the action. I finished ""Shadow Puppets"" not only caring much less about the characters than I had before, but downright irritated with them. And I had a headache after being hit non-stop with the Sledgehammer of Morality. This series has become too tedious for me...I won't be buying any further editions."
3,A Letdown,"SHADOW PUPPETS isn't exactly disappointing, but it certainly does not pack the emotional impact of Card's previous efforts. Bean and Petra are the central characters in this installment but the ""shadow"" of Achilles is never far behind. We see the denouement of the conflict between Bean and Achilles started in Ender's Shadow, but there's a certain emotional detachment about the whole process. Card seems on auto pilot here. This is clearly a bridge novel that will eventually bring us to the full realization of Peter's hegemonyAnd this is definitely not a book to be read if you have not read the previous novels. One would be hopelessly out of the loop to make sense of it all without prior knowledge gained in the previous works."
2,The first disappointing book in the shadow series,"I'm a big fan of the orson scott card shadow series, some of the books were brilliant, i was quite disappointed with this one, the story doesn't go anywhere, the brilliance of the characters some how disappeared in the book, im definetely going to try and read the next one in the series, because ender's shadow was brilliant so were the other books. i just hope that it will get better in the next one. If you are a fan on the series you should read this book just don't come with high expectations"
2,Don't buy in 3D,"If you like ""B"" Horror movies then you may like this movie. Don't buy it for the 3D effects. I am more interested in the 3D than I am in reviewing the movie so I don't recommend it in 3D. As for the story, lot of chasing, dying and some suspense but if you want to see it, rent it or don't spend your money on the 3D version."
1,WOW What a POOR attempt at making people buy this movie again....,"OK as for the Movie itself, I had bought it before and thought that it was not the worst remake one could have done. But the attempt at making this movie 3D is a joke, I only saw about 3-4 shots that were added for 3D effect. Some shots had added 3D Blood coming at you, and then when the windows in the hospital broke as zombie hoards jumped out the broken glass was digitally added like the blood to look 3D. I can personally take the 2D version and convert it to 3D using Corel WinDVD 11 and get a much better 3D movie than what this movie company attempted to do.... HEY MOVIE MAKERS if you wanna convert anymore movies from 2D - 3D then please call me, I can do it for you in about 10min 99th of the budget and it would be much better than this attempt at getting us sheep to re-buy these sad attempts at 3D conversion.Corel WinDVD Pro 11"
1,2D x 2 does not make a 3D film,"Why do i say in my subject that 2D x 2 does not make a 3D film, because that is what they have done here, not a single sign of any conversion of theis originally shot in 2D film, they have simple given you the same 2D image for both left and right eye, all they have done is to con the public by shifting one of the images on the horizontal by a few pixels so there appears to be seperation, this practice should be outlawed as it is selling the customer a product that is wrongly discribed, and so stealing there money from them, especially if like me you already have the 2D version. this is just wrong, be warned, most so called converted films that come out of Germany have the exact same problem, they are a con."
1,bad copie,"the 3d picture quality is really bad. half the time the image is really fuzzy and you cant follow it, it gives ne a headach."
1,Day of the Dead 3d,This was a honorable movie. It didn't make any sense what the zombies were doing. Zombies are not suppose to have any awareness of who they were. The acting was terrible too.
4,Beats WWF Raw Hands Down,This is the best wrestling game for the Xbox.I can't wait until the second edition of this game.I would of given it five stars but they need to work on the intros and the wrestlers music.
5,GREAT Wrestling Game!!!!,"I loved this game, it was one of the best wrestling games I have ever played. The controls are sweet and the finishers are easy to do. The only thing it is lacking is a couple legends that aren't there, but you can easily create them in the create a wrestler option. BUT THIS GAME IF YOU LOVE WRESTLiNG!!!!"
2,It's alright,This is a alright game.The game play is good.They could have made the season mode little more intersting.The only thing that I thought was cool was that you could use youre own music.
2,Well...It's A Wrestling Game`,"Is it just me, or are wrestling games getting tired and old, I mean, it seems like fights drag on for hours, and the fighting system ain't that great either. Of course, there are those that break the bond, like the new GC wrestler coming up with cell-shaded graphics, or the always fun Def Jam Vendetta, if you want a wrestling game, go with the creative ones, not tired boring ones like these."
2,Don't be fooled by the summary on the back,"I was a bit disappointed with this book. The description of the book did not match the actual story. First of all, this book simply can not be compared to the Story of O and if that is what you are looking for go elsewhere. The idea of the story was great...love is a necessary part of submission, but I felt the writing was choppy and elementary."
5,You will wonder how you lived without this book.,"This is one book I turn to over and over again. My copy is well worn and much loved. If I could have only one reference book, this would be it. You will wonder what you did before you had this book! A must for lovers of literature"
4,What a band! This title is the place to start,"I agree with the review by ""a music fan"" because Chico O'Farrill has assembled quite a band and the talent is evident. What prospective purchasers should know is that this compilation seeks to be broad rather than deep. If you don't like what you are hearing, the next tune might please you more. If you do like what you have heard, you might not get enough of it on this 2cd set.Having said that, O'Farrill shows how masterful he was with both Afro-Cuban songs and with the American standards as they liked to hear them in the 1950s. You will hear tight arrangements and some extraordinary solos. The rhythm line is tops and he rates with Puente, Machito, and Cugat - all of whom had greater followings but not necessarily among the players themselves. Find out what you like about him and then search out some of the other recordings that will provide further proof of his substantial talent."
3,Excellent description of Mississippi,"The setting is the strong suit of this book. It was myfirst by this author and the reason I read it was because Ilive in Mississippi. She does some excellent descriptionsof the Trace and surrounding countryside. Some of the characters were a little unbelievable, though. My bigcomplaint is the pacing. This book really drags sometimes.Very slow beginning, nothing really happened in the first 60 pages, except the heroine moving and getting settled in Mississippi. It's not a page turner andvery easily put down. Overall, it isn't a gripping plot and a little far-fetched in the end."
5,Intelligent reading,"Deep South is an intelligent book about life in Mississippi to an outsider, the new Park Ranger. The past haunts many of today's situations, and it is Anne Pidgeon's job to side step or fully confront many of them. Racism, sexual harrassment, and non-traditional employment is just a few of the traditions she is trying to cut through. Plenty of action, and a sound, well thought out book that flows well through the ending."
5,Excellent Read,"A winner. I had just travelled through the deep south when I finally picked up the newest Nevada Barr. I have been a faithful reader since Track of the Cat and have for the most part enjoyed following Anna Pigeon's career throughout the country. There have been some ups and some downs, but this is a definite up. Read it, read it, read it. In fact read them all."
2,"sorry to be the only nay-sayer, but","First, I buy every Nevada Barr book in hard cover, full price, asap.Second, this one was dull and had all the mystery in the last 25 pages. One of those endings that have all the motives, clues, and details just before the wrapup last chapter. I felt that I had been needlessly buried in Mississippi mud for far too long.Third, I will undoubtedly purchase the next Barr book the minute it is published because I am hopeful that Anna's next posting will be better."
3,"Not the best in the series, but enjoyable","Just a short review. While I usually enjoy the Anna Pigeon novels, I've got to say that this one was slightly more of a misfire than not. The mystery itself -- the brutal murder of a Mississippi girl on the Natchez Trace National Parkway -- is interesting, but the big problem with the book is that its resolution felt rushed and disappointing, as if Ms. Barr was more interested in the story of Anna's personal life than the raison d'etre of her mystery series. Still, it is an Anna Pigeon novel, and Barr's titular heroine is as endearing as ever, and that more than makes up for the book's shortcomings.Deep South isn't the best of the series, but it is an entertaining enough read to occupy a lazy afternoon with."
4,Southern experience all 'round,"Set in Mississippi, this is a great fun book. No, it's not going to pass as high art, but it is a page turner, especially when you get about half way through.There's a love interest also, for those into that sort of thing, and then the ""who dunnit"" aspect which keeps you on your seat.I was impressed that Barr has actually worked as a park ranger and it shows in the details in this book. Her plotting is also excellent and I'll look forward to reading more of her works.I found this book in a discount bin and decided to give it a shot. Glad I did as it turned out to be so much better than the usual stuff ""they"" try to sell you. While it's not perfect, it is pretty darn good."
3,Deep South,I read her book Burning and liked it. I think in comparison this book wasn't as appealing to me. I find the characters in this book interesting. I felt the plot was resolved a little too efficiently. I commend her in including difficult topics in her stories. It makes them interesting to read and relevant. I would recommend this book to people who like police type mysteries.
5,Mississippi Mud,"I was entranced with Nevada Barr's DEEP SOUTH. Talk about sense of place....In each book, Anna Pigeon is working at a different National Park. Here, she's in the Natchez Trace in Mississippi, and one can feel the heat and see the flora and fauna. The story almost disappears into the locale, but the murder of a high school girl is still the focal point of the story. Don't try to read this in the summertime, unless your air conditioner really works well."
3,Not for the not-lyrically-inclined,"Too much time wasted on nature descriptions and too little on building suspense. Also, I've read several Anna Pigeon novels now and find her a very depressing character. She hates people and has absolutely no sense of humor. Plus, there are no women in the book besides Pigeon. She's a loner which makes her a difficult character to like. I don't know...it's just not for me."
4,"Nevada Barr ""Deep South""","Nevada Barr takes you to a new National Park again. The way Anna Pidgeon,relates with her co-workers are interesting, and she shows what a strong woman can do, when pitted against men who are lazy and insecure with their jobs."
5,"Great mix of geography, sociology, suspense and humor!","I am totally addicted to Nevada Barr's Ranger Anna Pigeon series. Unlike many series, the change of locale to different national parks and Anna's quirky personality make each book hard to put down. Without too many references to past books in the series, it keeps readers like myself who read the books in order (just a teensy bit OCD!) engaged, while not making a first-time reader feel like they're lost.I love her plot twists. And her portrayal of Anna's personal situation during different decades - the 20's, 30's, 40's and now pushing the 50's in this book, are easy for a woman of a certain age to relate to.I can hardly wait to finish one and start the next. If you go to Nevada Barr's website, you can find a list of her Anna Pigeon books in order if you're just a teensy bit OCD like me! LOL!"
4,Southern Reflection,"This was an excellent book for giving the feel for the south and its unique natural environment. As usual for Barr, the blend of mystery,romance, nd community together with a special understanding of the environment made this a really fun novel to read. In addition, her understanding of the challenges of leadership makes the novel even more relevant to our times."
4,Deep South is Anna Pigeon at her most dangerous!,"Park Ranger Anna Pigeon in her new assignment in Mississippi stumbles upon a gruesome murder along the Natchez Trace Parkway. The handwritten sign on a tree demands she REPENT & amid alligators, Civil War reenactors & the Ole Boy Club she gets her first taste of Southern hospitality. In Deep South we find our intrepid Park Ranger far from her beloved Mesa Verde desert lands, surrounded by lush & humid forests, history & relics from the Civil War & a reluctant & patronizing park staff.I am always thrilled when another Anna Pigeon adventure comes out of Nevada Barr's mysterious & deeply researched pen & in Deep South, Anna Pigeon begins to come out of mourning for her long-lost husband, & gets her appetite back for life which is the only thing between her & certain death. A richly textured, thoughtful & provocative mystery set in an enchanting part of our world! Do check out my site for my full review."
5,Systematic approach,"As a person who is responsible for corporate planning for my company, I found this book extremely helpful in putting ideas and thoughts into structure, and thus able to approach strategic planning and management in a more systematic manner. Planning framework designed by using this Systems Thinking approach can be easily communicated to parties involved in the planning process, and be understood, accepted.For independent consultants whom are looking for an approach to carry out their practises in this areas, this book is helpful too.However, if you are looking for concise strategic planning implementation process, this book is somehow lacking. For that, I would like to recommend you to ""Team-based strategic planning: A complete guide to structuring, facilitating, and implementing the process"" by C. Davis Fogg."
3,Hard to follow,"A book whose description includes 'easy to follow' should be a lot easier to read. While the author's ideas are valid for the profession, as a leader in the field he could have had a better editor.The figures and tables flow over pages and the references may be pages away.On page 187 for example, the author draws attention to the Current State Assesment and points out ' to be sure to include evaluation of these ten areas, and then lists only 8.Getting the references and ignoring the discrepancies that could have been eliminated by careful editing is an additional hurdle that the reader has to face."
5,Good seller,I received this book in excellent condition and early in the range of dates promised for delivery. Tylernick is a very good seller.
3,Good product while it lasted,We used this for a couple of years and liked it a lot. But it had a plastic frame which broke in two places so I replaced it with another model which has a metal frame. I will ALWAYS use Microplane graters and zesters.
3,Best Parchment Paper!,This PP is THE only one I use 'cause it's simply the best out there...I'm giving only 3 stars because shipping charges are way too expensive!!!
5,"Great, fun toy","This toy was given to our little one when he was two and he just loves it. It gives him an outlet to bang on something without destroying it and it really keeps him occupied for a little while. He loves the fact that it looks like a tool bench and that he has his own hammer. That hammer has whacked quite a few thngs around the house, including the cat, and it doesn't hurt anything like the drywall, baseboards, etc. Really a nice toy and one that won't destroy other things in the house. It's easier to use than the wooden ones plus you don't have to worry about splinters. Some of the nuts are harder to get through than the others, but it really makes a nice challenge for him."
4,fun shape sorter,We got this for our son's first Christmas when he was 10 months old. At first he just like the shapes when they were out of the table... they rattle. It wasn't until about 14 months old that he started to understand the concept of hitting them through the table with the hammer. Now at 17 months old it is one of his favorites. The string on the hammer could be just a little longer... it has to be lined up just perfect in order to have enough room to hit the shapes. Also the sides could be a little taller so that the shape actually fell through the other side when it is sitting on the floor. Normally my son wants me to hold it while he hits so he can push the shapes all the way through. Overall we really like this toy and I'm always excited to find a basic non-battery skill teaching toy. We recite the colors while playing with this and some of the shapes... although some are hard to really name. Oh and my son thinks any toy you can hit is great... definate bonus.
4,Good buy,"Pretty good toy. I bought it to help my daughter learn shapes and matching. She still hasn't gotten to that point yet but enjoys hammering and making the pieces rattle. I like that it will also be useful and interesting in a few months once she understand more about shapes.The hammer string is entirely too short. I cut it off within 45 seconds of opening it up. An adult would struggle with hammering with it. I wish they had made it longer, but I am not too worried since the rest of the pieces are removable too. They are all going to get lost :)"
3,Not the best effort but it has its moments (1978),"Sounds alot like I'm Glad Your Here Eith Me Tonight which preceded this one and actually has a solo You Don't Bring Me Flowers on it. Neil was releasing alot of material in the mid-late 70s and each had the same great production ingredients but this does struggle a bit for consistency. Still, I like mothers and daughters and forever in blue jeans. I do actually listen to this one quite a bit."
1,Incessant buzzing noise,This TV has a horrible buzzing noise that you can hear constantly even with the volume turned up. Even when the TV is in the standby mode (no picture) you can hear the buzz. The only time it doesn't is if you turn the set completely off. I would not recommend buying this TV and am sending it back.
1,"For GBA, Baseball Advance beats both High Heat and All Star","Don""t believe the hype. This is just like High Heat 2003 for the GBA; one field, 30 background images. Baseball Advance has the 4 best fields (Fenway and Wrigley for classic, Safeco and Pac Bell for new) so you can hit off the green monster etc. High Heat is the king of PC baseball, but for the portable (wonder why the Pocket PC""s don""t have a version), it""s GBA Baseball Advance. You""ll even enjoy playing the whole season, makes the trip to the gym more fun, on the bike and stair stepper anyway :-)"
1,Baseball Advance beats both High Heat and All Star,"I have all 3 baseball games for the gameboy advance, and was hoping for more from All Star Baseball. Like High Heat, there is only 1 true stadium; all the others are just background pictures. That's one of the cool things about Baseball Advance, even though there are only 4 stadiums, they're the best ones. 2 classic (Fenway, Wrigley) and 2 new (Safeco and Pac Bell). Even with last year rosters, baseball advance has the best gameplay. High Heat 2003 for the computer is the best bar none, but for the gameboy advance not quite."
3,Wait until 2004...,"I would recommend you not buy any of the GBA's Baseball games this year. I personally an going to wait until Sega releases a version of Baseball Advance with link cable support. All-Star Baseball is a decent Baseball game, however, to have any real fun with the game, you'd have to spend [more money] to get two copies (for multiplayer capabilities). That could be money well spent, if this were a better baseball game."
3,Not Quite up to snuff,"The problem with this game is that it is too hard, and it is not realistic. It is extremely difficult to get a multi-base hit (99 % of the hits by the computer and user are singles), the AI is really dumb (the runners don't know when to advance properly), the computer pitcher absolutely never throws a ball, etc. It is challenging, but too much so. I found Baseball Advance to be a much more playable game. It has the right blend of difficulty and challenge without being ridiculous."
2,"Not worth your money, unless you get it for $5","Graphics: The graphics are OK, except for one thing: Every player looks the same!(except for having different skin color)The teams all have the same color, also.Gameplay: Unless you put it on Hard (All-Star), the game is way to easy. If you tilt the batting target a certain way, you can get a hit 90% of the time. As for pitching, just pitch to a corner, and you'll get an out almost every time. Plus the baserunning is totally messed up.Special Features: If you're getting this game for the special features in the console version, don't. There is no create-a-player, or Hall-of-Fame team. The only thing it has are trading cards, which serve no purpose.BOTTOM LINE: Too easy, gets boring quickly, no good extras,players and teams all look the same."
3,Could have been better,"After playing Need for Speed Most Wanted I had high hopes for this game. But NO, this game was lacking in all parts, cop chases, boss levels, just everything. [...]"
2,...Really?,So I have need for speed Carbon for the Xbox and Wii. This version for the Nintendo DS is nothing like the versions of the game on the actual big consoles. Controls are difficult and hard to get used to the game is extremely boring and you play for about 10 min. and nothing happens.I played for about 20 min. and had to put it down because it was not fun at all. And I have not played since.
5,Fletcher Terry Framers' Points,Excellent product. My new Fletcher Teryy Point Driver works really well too!! If you're considering buying this product it's definitely worth the money.
2,shipping problems,Recieved first shipment with almost half of the order which was 3 boxes points falling out of box returned and ordered a new batch. Same problem not as much fell out but there is a problem with how they were packed.They were just thrown in a box no padding or packing material to keep the boxes from banging around and opening to where the points started falling out of the boxes.
5,Great deal!,"Product shipped quickly and was as advertised. It was the best price I found, either locally or on -line. Will definately buy here again."
1,Needs an editor,"I purchased this book after purchasing Danchev's new biography of Cezanne. I found both unreadable. He strings multiple phrases together with semi-colons, in EVERY paragraph. It is hard to follow from the beginning of one sentence to the end. I await good biographies of Braque and Cezanne."
4,A Good Book on the History of Kimono,This is a very good guide to the history of the kimono and its importance in Japanese society. Perhaps its only fault is that it doesn't have a huge amount of pictures and those pictures that it does have are largely in black and white.
5,A book based on fine research,"This is an essential book, I think, for clothing designers, people who like Japanese style, and fabric makers -- as well as others.Dalby's knowledge of Japan and women's kimono fashion is based on personal knowledge in the culture, including a stint as an ""American geisha"" in Japan and all the kimono wearing that involved. She also did terrific book research.One of the intriguing parts of the book is the revelation of the fashion art of woodblock print (ukiyo-e) artists. The book becomes a double pleasure of fashion AND art.Her prose explains kimono to you with ease, and it reads like tips from a favorite friend. Even for a man who never expects to wear a yukata again, I enjoyed it tremendously."
4,All is well,"This book arrived as promised, the condition wasn't as good as I had hoped but it is acceptable."
1,Terrible Program!!,"This program does NOT say on the box that it only supports rectangle and square digital pictures. In fact, when looking at the box, it clearly shows ovals and specialty shaped photographs plopped right on the templates! Once you have opened the program and installed it, only THEN do you discover such is not available.It is neither fast, easy, nor fun to print and cut when you want to E-MAIL something on a template. UGH. Do NOT waste your money on THIS Hallmark program. The Hallmark name should not have gone on this.It's not even ONE star---it's a TURKEY."
4,Worth it for the Clipart...,"I too had the same trouble with the photos being distorted, or not being able to edit them into shapes. But I also have Art Explosion Scrapbook Factory Deluxe and I can use the clipart from the Hallmark program there (go to Import: Graphic and then browse for your Sierra Hallmark folder in the drop down menu). There is no simple way to search the grahics other than look at every one in the list, but you get Hallmark's awesome backgrounds and characters in Art Explosion's user friendly format."
1,Agree with waste of time and money,"If you are planning to use with digital photos, don't get this one. You must actually do the cutting to place photos. Has a lot to it but most is useless if you plan to design and print with your pictures."
1,Very Disappointed-Stay Away!!,"I was so happy to get this, but then so disappointed. I have all the Hallmark Card programs, and love them.I thought you could import your phtos, and they would fit right into the shapes of the templates,like the photo projects in the card programs, but they don't, and it's a pain to try to get them to fit in just right, and then they look distorted.I think it also caused problems with my other Hallmark programs because I'm having gliches there that I didn't have before."
4,Lots of fun options,"Re: the first review...that's interesting that you had troubles on ME. I installed the program on Windows 98, but then upgraded to ME without any problems. All in all, this is a great program people who want to create beautiful scrapbooks, but don't have a lot of time to design them from scratch."
3,More of a Question than a Review,"To those who have purchased this item....is it only for electronic scrapbooks, or can you print out pages for hard copy books?"
2,Waste of time and money... for now,"I had the previous edition for Win98 and thought the new edition for WinXP would have fixed the previous problems but it has not. I was able to load the software fine and it runs well, and the pre-designed templates are great! But... it still won't allow you to import digital photos to shapes other than squares/rectangles. So, at least half of the templates are useless unless you enjoy printing the template and manually cutting out the design (star, oval or circle) and putting a hard copy photo behind the shape. Yes, it is more like real scrapbooking, but come on! I know the technology is out there and it is just a matter of layering. Wait until Hallmark wakes up and smells the Elmers and makes a top-knotch scrapbook program... which we can only hope will come soon!"

3,Caution Windows ME users!,"The box to this software says it runs on Windows ME, but it does not! I had the older version of the software, but when we upgraded from Windows 98 to Windows ME, it no longer worked. So I was thrilled to see this update which claimed to run on ME. Well, when we installed it, I had the exact same problem as with the older edition--there were no contents in any of the folders! We have a second operating system on our computer and were able to install the software on that. As far as contents go, this is a great software! Very cute scrapbook pages and ideas. Just beware that it may not run on your operating system!"
5,Why is this book out of print?,"Like many books on prop making, a lot of the materials and techniques describe in Motley's Theatre Props are a bit out of date. Published in 1975, it's still firmly in the old papier-mache-and-chickenwire world of prop building. In spite of that, Theatre Props deserves to be kept in print solely because of its wonderful introduction by Margaret Harris. In only ten pages, Harris gives a concise course in theatrical prop building that could stand perfectly well on its own without the rest of the book. There are still second-hand copies of this book available, and every props person should own one.WulfEditor & PublisherProptology Magazine"
3,Sad Nostalgic Look at the 1950's,"Dr. Shryock wrote many health and spiritual/religious books from his Seventh-Day Adventist perspective. He was an early and vocal medical advocate against tobacco. The attitudes about sexuality, virginity, alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, marriage and religion may appear quaint and ""out-dated"" to the ""modern"" reader, but if one realizes that those that followed his advice find themselves secure against AIDS, BSE, substance abuse, unplanned pregnancy and marital strife, it might make it worthwhile to re-examine his perspective.That does not make him ""right."" but reading this puts a sober perspective on what is ""right"" and what's not in today's society."
5,Fantastic Sandals...Super comfortable,"I bought these for my 82 year old cousin and she hasnt stopped wearing them. They are so comfortable, I'm almost thinking of getting a pair for myself. They have a low heel...almost nothing to be completely honest with you... and the soul is rubber and easy on the foot. A great present for a senior citizen...."
3,ok shoe,"This shoe is OK. Nothing to rave about. Not uncomfortable but not a shoe you would want to wear for long, long walks. Looks cute with a sun dress."
5,Rush Hour Jr. Review,I cannot say enough good things about this game. The educational benefits are amazing and it is so much fun. My five year old son recently received this game and he absolutely adores it. He's played through the game several times and really enjoys figuring out the puzzles. I also liked how the cards have a nice range of difficulty. This was instantly a favorite and we plan on purchasing other versions. We would definitely recommend this game to everyone.
5,My 5 year old loves this puzzle game!,"From the time we read the instructions and showed him how to play he fell in love with this toy. It really helps with problem solving, which he has always been fast at. He has been playing it constantly since I opened it, 2 hours ago.. He can set it up on his own and play by himself. My husband and I love to watch as he uses his problem solving skills to unravel the puzzle. Great buy for any age. Even my 26 year old hubby gets into it, though the box says ages 6 - 8. Its fun for everyone!"
4,"A great ""think it through on your own"" toy","For children who likes puzzles and mazes, this is a great find. To get the ice cream truck out of the traffic jam, the child must think on more than one level and more than one move ahead. Any wrong moves can be easily reversed and there is no penalty for wrong moves, only the thrill of solving the puzzle. Its great for solo play or for two to work together. The travel bag makes it a terrific ""take along"" toy -- as long as you have a flat surface on which to set up the board. My son is five years old and takes great pride in solving the simplest level puzzles. With a total of four levels of difficulty, I think we will be playing this game for some time to come."
5,Great toy!,"I bought this for my 4 year old grandson. He can do all the first and second levels and his 5 year old sister can do all the third level, and some of the fourth. They love playing it either alone when one is not at home or taking turns and playing it together. I have never seen the 5 year old stick to anything as long as she does this. she will not leave until she has solved it. The concentration factor that this game encourages is great. I will be buying the advanced version for my older grandchild this Christmas."
1,blah,I had high hopes for this little game however the kids were quickly bored and the game will undoubtedly do nothing but collect dust for the rest of it's life.
4,Think Fun Rush Hour Jr.,"I work recommend Rush Hour to every parent who wants to challenge the problem solving skills of their child. Fifteen years ago I purchased the standard version for my daughter. When they were down to visit I brought it out for my six year old grandson who immediately wanted to play it. Realizing it was a bit challenging, I decided to purchase the junior version. Even though he loved it, at age six he was able to wiz through most of the cards. I would still do it again, because he loved the idea he could solve the problems."
5,LOVE it!,"Both my boys LOVE this game and get so excited when they solve a puzzle. My 7-year-old was able to solve all of the puzzles, even up to expert. At first I didn't think my 4-year-old would be able to, as he was confused as to how to set it up, but once he got the hang of it he started solving puzzles too. The levels are the perfect challenge for him. We will be taking this along with us for a travel game."
5,GREAT game / puzzle,"My daughter got RushHour Jr. as a birthday present when she turned five. She loved it. Her eight year old brother also loved it. Even my husband got hooked on it. Even though this is the ""Junior"" version, it still is pretty challenging. Perfect for boys and girls. Definitely teaches logical thinking. We have now graduated to Rush Hour (the non-junior version). This makes a great birthday gift."
3,My 6 year old blew through the whole game quickly.,"I wanted to get something to entertain my 6 year old while his sister does gymnastics (other than giving him an electronic device). Since this is rated for 6-8 year olds, and he just turned 6 a month earlier, I thought this was the right game. But he finished the whole thing in a couple of hours -- and there are no expansion packs for this game. He enjoyed it (and he doesn't usually enjoy puzzles), and its a good game, but it didn't take him very long."
3,Not an inspiring album,"I love Jobim. I have most of his albums going back to the 1960s, however i was very disappointed with this one. The music is just not up to his highest potential and rather mediocre in light of his previous successes. I do love his rendition of ""Fascinatin Rythm"", however, the rest of they album leaves much to be desired. I do realize that this work was done later in his life and it is sad to see that his talent seemed to fade a bit at this point."
3,Good but could be better,First off I'd like to say for the price the Champion is an excellent machine for what I imagine most people use it for. However with that being said I must say that for a Raw foodist or a pro-active vegan/vegitarian it is less than ideal. It makes juice GREAT but does not juice greens or wheatgrass well and smokes when you try to homogonize several things such as almond butter and wheat berries. Overall good but defintly has room for improovement.
5,great juicer,"I am not a raw foodist, but I really like making my own peanut butter, good juices and fruit sorbet. For these sorts of things, the Champion is great. We like putting frozen fruit into it to make yummy, no-sugar-added desserts. and since it has a continuous extraction, it doesn't get clogged. Definitely worth the price."
5,Works as Advertised!,"This little machine is a brute - obviously a refined design, improved over time. It does one thing very well - extracts the juice from vegetables and fruits. It is not under-powered; and the pulp by-product is quite dry, meaning that most of the juice is extracted. The motor portion is quite heavy and the juicer parts go together with some effort. A slightly built person with weaker hands may have trouble assembling and disassembing the juicer parts. I am pleased with the machine and its performance. If you are going to get into ""juicing"", this is a great machine."
2,Disappointing,"The 5th edition of this book had been compulsory reading during my undergraduate inorganic chemistry courses: it was the inorganic chemistry bible. This edition fails to reach the high standard of its predecessor. In fact, it isn't even a good advanced inorganic chemistry text. Much of the really useful stuff that forms the basis of an understanding of inorganic chemistry has been omitted in favour of niche topics. The book would be better called 'Advances in Inorganic Chemistry' or 'Selected Topics in Inorganic Chemistry'."
4,NICE TEXT FOR UNDERGRAD INORGANIC CHEMISTRY,"With this edition of ""Advanced Inorganic Chemistry"", Albert Cotton and his co-authors have proved that they kept track of all the recent developments in the field.This text provides clear and balanced coverage, as it applies to Inorganic Chemistry. Every branch of the course was browsed, and with generous details too. In addition to the general principles and laws, there are updated information on: Atomic Structures of elements, Chemical Bondings and related associations; as well as Chemical Equilibria and Enthalpy.Together with its insight in Nuclear Chemistry, the details this book provided on inorganic elements and compounds is worthy of praise. It is a fine textbook, which anyone who has the basic knowledge of elementary chemistry should be glad to read."
1,after polish it work,"when I open it and put it in the gamecube it did not work, disc game error. I am trying to pulish it. I pulish it and is working but i don't think that this should happen with a used game buyed on such a nice store."
4,SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!!,"This is a reaaaaaaaaalllllllllyyyyyy awesome game! Picture this, racing at breakneck speeds through TONS of traffic, you gettin the picture? Yep, thats it, incredible crashes, traffic that tries to swerve out of your way, liking it so far? In other words, the perfect game for me. I only have a few problems with it, 1.I don't have a memory card so I can't save (sniff)2. Reaaaaaaaaaaallllly corney music.3. To many (or not enough?) mystery cars.4. On a more pesonal note, MY TV IS TOO SMALL!! Other than that, it's a great buy(in other words,WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, GET IT!!)."
3,The Best For Your Cube,"Don't get me wrong this game is a blast and gets 5 stars in the fun factor. But, it's dissappointing in some ways. Such as some other reviewers have said it doesn't have car liscensing. Such as you can drive ""pickup"" instead of ""Ford F-150"". Also the street signs could use some detailing to be realistic and the guiding arrows aren't visible till it's almost too late. Yet, it's a total blast and I'd reccomend it to all racing enthusiasts."
1,Give this one a miss,"I really regret purchasing this game. Good idea, poor implementation.The back cover leads you to believe that the game is all about terrific crashes. In the game itself, the crashes are far from spectacular, and after a few crashes you're tired of seeing the tri angle view. The car models themselves are only marginally destructable, and the environment is not destructable at all, leaving you wishing you could skip the instant replay of the boring crash scenes.I spent the first few minutes of the game going through menus to turn off the terrible music. Graphically, the game is anything but impressive.I wouldn't reccomend this title to anyone, it seems as though little to no effort went into the development of this game."
4,Burn Out SUXS,Burn Out suxs.It is the worst raceing game i have ever played.I have play just about every raceing game nitendo has come out with but this one is by far the worst.The cars Crash with very lil effert.in the beging you do not have a good selection of cars or trakes.The graphices r the only reson i would buy this game.This is a very dissipointing game.
2,More like Boringout,"I lucky I rented this before I purchased it because the game is really boring and there is only a couple of vehicles to use.I almost blew....alot of money but,instead I got Super Smash Bros...The crashes are stupid,the hood gets a LITTLE DENT and the windows crack.I don't like games that time you either.I would recomend you to get Super Smash Bros. Melee or Starwars Rogue Leader or SSX Tricky,because those are the best games on Gamecube so far....there are lot's of new games coming out so just wait.When I rented Burnout...I thought that the crashes would be better,the graphics would be better,the sound would be better,the gameplay would be better,but all of it was WORSE!Graphics:4.5/10Sound:3.5/10Gameplay:2/10dumb"
2,Jaded - Get Burnout 2 Instead,"I have to admit that I am probably jaded. I got Burnout 2 (B2) before getting Burnout 1 (B1) and there is a world of difference. Now, if I had gotten B1 when it first came out, I might have been impressed. But, now, there is no way I would trade them. B2 has much better graphics, better sound, slightly better control. B1 takes too long for many races. It forces you to see crashes way more often than you want to. I did not find B1 any ""harder"" than B2, just more annoying. The jaggies on B1 make it hard to see detail, so that makes B2 so much more impressive (it runs on the same hardware). Only get B1 if you want the ""full"" Burnout experience and/or are trying to be records (the latter is my perspective, obsessive-compulsive person that I am)."
2,there are no 300 cars,This game ist the great big deal there are saying. The game only has 10 levls and 5 are the other-way-aroun version of the last five. The cars are not cool they suc and the graphics are ok not wow. they dont rewrd bad drivng they just give u a turbo if u pass clos to a car at a hgh speed. if u crash it takes away turb. You get like 20 secs per checkpoints and if u crash u loose like 3 seconds. if u dont like checkpoints it isnt ur game. there are only like 7 cars u can drive. its not a good game at all. Its too expensive for what it is.
1,none,"I gave Burnout 1 star beacause it didn't use the car's names. It used the janaric name of the cars like sportscar and pickup. That alone cost the at least one star. Second, I didn't think that the game presented a real chalange like other racing games such as Need For Speed do. In those games you get points for doing things like placing in races, but you don't get that in Burnout. You also have different options in NFS that you don't get in Burnout. You can Be the Cop and catch the annoying speedsters. In my opinion, you just get a better quality of game in NFS. I would say not to buy this game. If you like a real racing game, Burnout is a poor choice."
2,"great game, but...","this game is hands-down the best racer for GC. but there's a major flaw. this game took me about 3 days to beat, after you unlock everything theres really nothing left to do but 2 player mode which dries up easily. and the AI isnt NASCAR worthy. this game is great for renting but not for buying.-Peace"
3,one annoying game,"Burnout is a very sad racing game the crashes replay 3 times everytime you crash and get quite annoying when you're trying to race.The courses are ok at the begining but once u get to the middle you start to see practically the same course you ran earlier in the game and the 300 vechiles advertised are 295 vechiles that you don't get to drive, this is a very poor game and i suggest that anyone should rent it before thinking of purchasing it."
1,Waste of time and money,"I was never compelled to write a review before, but this CD was so disappointing and irritating to listen to that I just HAD to. I hate to be so negative, but feel quite disappointed by the rave reviews by someone like Margo Anand which made me order the CD. I am not sure what there was to rave about. $15 bucks plus shipping and handling down the drain."
1,Had the potential to be awesome.,"I know, I'm alittle harsh on this cd, but if there were only instrumental tracks, and NO vocals or human sounds, this cd would have been AWESOME. It did not get us in the mood, but it did the complete opposite."
2,A flawed gem,What would have been a great album was spoiled by interference. It must have been recorded in a zoo as at times the loud chattering of the monkeys overwhelms the band. You can even hear individual words. Totally uncivilised audience!
5,Darkly dramatic and thoroughly enjoyable.,"Agitating and alluring, this album is all the the things you would want in the score of a thriller. Djawadi creates suspense with strings and draws drama from layers of music. Plus The Veils track is a surprising delight in the midst of instrumental arrangement. Well-conceived and executed all around."
5,Highly Effective Soundtrack,Not really a Kevin Costner fan but the movie was recommended to me so I decided to take a look. I was impressed with the movie and the soundtrack. It is unique and adds so much to the feel of the film.
3,Cool but a tad awkward,"So I enjoyed building this one, and Catwoman is really rad (I actually put her in the Batman/Joker chemical plant set) but I don't really know what to do with this one. The purple batsuit is ugly, and there's, like, engines on the wings. Waddup wit that? Fun to have, perhaps to hang from the ceiling with some fishing line, but the design falls short of expectation."
3,Romantic nostalgia,"Colin Turnbull romanticizing of the Mbuti pygmies in ""The Forest People"" is allowable given the period in which it was written. In some ways, the book really tells us more about the ethnographer than the people he studied. Turnbull found the Mbuti way of life to have a simple, spiritual quality that he admired greatly.... part of this admiration stemmed from his own background in an elitist British social and academic system. Turnbull was simply ""in love"" with the Mbuti.Anthropology has (hopefully) advanced to the point where its practitioners allow themselves a greater recognition of their possible biases. Even so, who is to say that an understanding of the ethnographer is not more important than the study group.The book reads pleasantly, if not scientifically."
4,good service,this book was in great shape but it took it really long time to get here. which it didnt take so long but the quality of the book was great
4,The Forest People,"I am not completely finished reading the book. However, so far, I have found it entertaining and educational. It is amazing to me how the pygmies can exist in the forest with virtually none of what we would view as essentials. A very simple way of life."
3,A good story with a few flaws,"I really liked this book. I had to read it for class, but i would recomend it to anyone. It was quick and easy to read. It was a good and sympathetic portrayal of these hunter gatherer peoples and it left me with a lot of respect for them and for the author.There were only a couple of little things I would have changed about the book. I felt like a little too much had been edited out in some spots and the author was a little over sentamental at times. For my purposes i would have liked a little more of a scientific approach to some things, but it does make a very good story overall."
5,Nothing short of amazing.,"There are two things that one can't believe about this book simultaneously: 1. that it is a great work of participant-observer anthropology 2. that it is not fiction. (It is, though, both things.) This book is really an adventure for anyone. The stories and anecdotes are enchanting and informative. I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Interesting,I was forced to read it but it is an interesting book because they live so differently from me and its interesting how differently they were described by the British and so forth. It was hard to follow the different characters but I'd recommend it.
1,Friends don't EVER buy this for other friends as an Xmas present,"Where can I start to cleave this piece of garbage? This movie deserves NO STARS. The story was tone deaf, I figured out who the bad guy was the first time I saw them, the special fx were something developed out of an 80's toaster program, I've seen better acting in a grade school class play."
1,"Thumbs Down, Down, Down","The only good acting out of the whole movie was the lead man,Brian Krause.The graphics were what you would find in a hand held videocam recording. The rest of the actors and actresses performed like the ones on a spaghetti western. I'm glad that I rented it and didn't buy it."
3,ALMOST as the good as the others commercial !,"Starring : Brian Krause,Heather McCombDirected : Anthony FankhauserThis is really well done Science Fiction !Krause is a classic hero,Kind of like Bruce Willis in Armageddon...That kind of bent.McComb actually gets more to do and goes thru a myriad of emotions and has the audience against and THEN routing for her very next move.The special effects are getting rave reviews,Tiny Juggernaut has seriously stepped up from journeyman techs to "" Hey,We have a threat on our hands Big Hollywood !""Knowing there is a bigger budget,But similar film coming to theatres,This is not a `Mockbuster' to be taken lightly.Throughly entertaining and chracters that are allowed to breath with depth...Yes,Depth ."
1,Horrible movie.,"This movie was absolute trash. I didn't bother buying the movie. I just watched it online, and it wasn't even worth watching online. The acting was poor and so was the character's. Whoever made this movie should be ashamed of themself's. Please don't waste your time watching this movie. Your not going to find anything good in this movie."
1,This is a big amateur joke!,"Geez...all I can say is that all the ""1-star"" reviews are absolutely correct! This is one of the worst movies I ever seen. Poor effect, poor scripts, lousy acting,.....you name it, all are here! Probably this is the Director's first ""trial"" movie?? Oh please..."
1,A low budget is no excuse for making of such a bad movie,"I just regret I did not listen to the comments from the fellow reviewers below, but as a hard die sci-fi went ahead anyway. In a nutshell, this is a really bad bad movie, from any angle you look at it. Lousy plot, mediocre acting and directing, poor special effects, using lots of old NASA clips from the Space Shuttle, and so rudimentary that any TV series from the late 70s has better SFX than this flick. I really think that despite the low budget, nowadays there is no excuse for making such a lousy movie (and Moon demonstrates that a good movie does not necessarily requires a fat budget). And by the way, the 2012 addition to the title is just a marketing hook trying to take advantage of the 2012 phenomena hype.In summary, do not waste your time and money watching this movie. Together withImpact,Meteor,Polar Storm, andMeteor Apocalypse, 2012: Supernova will be remembered among the worst sci-fi of 2009."
2,Not As Good As the Last One,"Dizzy Up the Girl was a highlight of that year's music, especially the under-appreciated ""Black Balloon"". But this new album by the Goo Goo Dolls is just less catchy, less itnertesting, and not very fun to listen to. Stick with Dizzy Up the Girl if you're going to own this band's music."
5,Nice!,"The Goo Goo Dolls are excellent songwriters, and it shows on this album. There's an excitement that seems to radiate from almost every song, and it's pretty cool!"
4,MY OPINION OF GUTTERFLOWERS,"I honestly have to say that it is growing on me. I ""LOVE"" ""THINK ABOUT ME""...its unlike the other songs on the cd. Its more up beat and fun!! Johnny's lyric's are alot more intense and dark in comparison to DUTG! His voice has never sounded better. Robby's song's sound alot like his pryor songs that are on DUTG. SOmetimes its hard for me to to be critical when it comes to the Goo's. I really do love most of their music. I respect their determination and their strong will to keep putting out better music for their fans. I believe that gutterflowers will bloom!!"
3,Post punk soft rock with a bitter twist,"With the release of Gutterflower (the band's first studio album in almost four years), the Goo Goo Dolls deliver a twelve song collection of the same radio friendly ear candy that defined 1998's Dizzy Up the Girl. Although older fans will likely dismiss this latest offering as another attempt tp re-achieve the commercial success of the 1995 smash Name and City of Angel's Iris, newer fans will find much to like here. Lyrically, Gutterflower is considerably more bitter and cynical than any of the bands' previous cd's. Song's like What A Scene help convey these emotions with sharp, albeit not quite heavy, guitar riffs. All in all, after eagerly awaiting a new Dolls album for more than 3 years, I can't help but feel a little shortchanged. Gutterflower just isn't as memorable as Dizzy Up the Girl. Good but not great: buy a new copy of Superstar Carwash instead."
3,Goo Goo Dolls,"I thought this album was quite different to the previous one, but still enjoyable, if not rockin'"
3,Leaves a little to be desired.,"As I have found in the past the Dolls have realeased the hook song first (as most groups do) but didn't have much to follow it with. After listening to the album I found a lot of the tracks didn't seem to give as much of the punch that the old Goo used to. It seems that Gutterflower was written and recorded in the rush of fan demand rather than in thier own good time. In previous albums you can really hear the time that was devoted to the album, hence that wait of sometimes 4 years for a album. I think the wait was that long this time but it seems the entire album may have been written and recorded in the period of a year rather than the entire 4 years. I'm hoping that the music will grow on me and I won't be disappointed into the future."
1,very overrated band,Dont pay attention to any of these 4 & 5 star reviews. This album is a complete waste of time & space in anyones music library.
4,DECENT ALBUM,"After reading many customer reviews which talked about how good this album is,I decided to go out and buy it. And while there are several really great songs on here,such as ""What a Scene"", ""Sympathy"" and ""Big Machine"",i truly thought that there was going to be more good quality songs like those...but there really aren't any. Especially the tracks in which Robby Takac does all the lyrics--I'm sorry to say this,but his voice is horrible..it's just not pleasant to listen to. The song, ""Smash"",is really the only decent one that he sings. John Rzeznik's voice is definitely what makes the album shine. Like i said,there are several tracks that are great,and the other ones are just ""ok"" but surely have something worth listening to in them. If you've liked past albums by the Goo Goo Dolls,then you will no doubt enjoy this one too---"
5,Goo Goo Dolls are here to stay,"With their previous hits ""Name,"" ""Iris,"" and ""Slide,"" the Goo Goo Dolls have become a household name. For some bands coming up with a solid followup album can be quite difficult, but the Goos seem to have done just that with no sweat. ""Gutterflower"" is an edgier, most mature record for the Goos. With heavier, melodic guitar riffs, precise drums, and vocals that are sexy, but at the same time display yearning and other passionate emotions, ""Gutterflower"" is one of the best CDs of the year. For everyone out there, I recommend this CD because it is simply a must-have in all of your collections."
3,Battery-powered rock,"Though Gutterflower is not as smooth as Dizzy Up The Girl it didn't become something like a real rock album which was said. Yes, the songs are more rock than pop but to be honest, when I heard it'd be more rock I was thinking of something like Hold Me Up and Superstar Car Wash, with a few 'hitsingles' on it. Now Gutterflower has become a mainstream battery-powered rock album without any real hitsingles.Johnny's best songs are Big Machine, Truth Is A Whisper and What A Scene (By the way, there are no guitarsolo's on the album!). Robby's best song on the album is Tucked Away, that's great action! It's not the album I first thought it'd be to me, but it's surely not a bad one."
3,Sounds like the last two,"I really like this album alot, there are plenty of good tunes that make this an easy listen, but like has been brought up numerous times...it sounds very similiar to the last two records. ""Here is Gone"" definitely is a great song, but when I heard it being used as music for a Dawson's Creek add it just kind of blew it for me. I think that may be the crowd they are shooting for, but dammit when are we going to get a real rock record again!!"
4,Respect for Gutterflower,"Many people often refer back to ""A Boy Named Goo"" and ""Dizzy"" when speaking of the ""Dolls"". Gutterflower is a very good CD... I like it, most fans will like it...sure it's not ""Dizzy"" and I think it could have had more Acoustic tracks, which is where Johnny and Robbie really shine.Watch their VH1 Storytellers, AWESOME. But you can tell they were going for something new. I read another reviewer say ""overproduced"" and although I was going to agree, I listened to the whole CD again and had a thought. Listen to this CD more than once. It's VERY GOOD! Going in a slightly refreshing direction from ""Dizzy"". These are a couple of fellas that you WANT to do well. Their live shows are Great, Lyrics are GREAT. Gutterflower is Very Good! To steal a line from the Go-Go's, ""God Bless the Goo Goo Dolls""...Buy It."
4,Another great album from Goo Goo Dolls,"""Another great album by the Goo Goo Dolls, I always come back and listen to this one......!"""
2,not so hot,"this album isn't that good, it only has about 3 good songs on it. There best album yet is still dizzy up the girl. Don't waste your money."
2,Average at Best,"The Goo,Goo Dolls have learned the Formula Game.now while the Lyrics have gotten a bit more fuller on this Set there standard of Instrumentation&Production is in the same safe territory.this Band much like Matchbox 20 has found a safeness&they are both trapped in&stuck there."
3,Good. But not as good as...,"""Dizzy Up the Girl""...""Gutterflower"" is a must have if you are a Goo Goo Dolls fan but it's not as good as ""Dizzy Up The Girl"" but better than ""A Boy Named Goo"", to me anyway. ""Sympathy"" shows a very profound side of Johnny and makes as all think about our own lifes and mistakes (like all his music really)But to make a long review short Gutterflower is worth buying. Just skip the songs that Robbie sings because they in no way compare to Johns. =)"
4,3's A Charm!,"This is an easy review. If you enjoyed Boy Named Goo and Dizzy Up The Girl you will enjoy Gutterflower. Simple as that. John and Robby broke no new ground here. I give the last two CD's 5 stars (both true pop/rock gems) this one 4, only for lacking originality in overall sound. If Gutterflower had come first it would have gotten 5 stars and Dizzy 4. Lets call Gutterflower the closing of the ""Trilogy"" as John picks up the pieces from his broken relationship. But even from this fan, it's time to move on boys. Your fans (like you) are getting older and I for one will expect some artistic growth out of your next endeavor. You have proven yourselves with consistency. Now lets see if you really have what it takes to endure into the new millenium and move on to true Rock God status. Gutterflower will satisfy for now, but I will expect bigger and better things next time."
3,Not quite steering into the middlebrow,"Not quite steering into the middlebrow though always close to being relegated to the swampy purgatory of afternoon AM rock, gutterflower does have its highlights. There is the immediatejump and hitch to Big Machine, the airy acoustics and amiable singing of Here Is Gone and What A Scene, where the not nearly hoarse light tones of the vocals and confused electricsdo alright.Though Up, Up, Up is a better job by the Goo Goo's other singer than You Never Know, the singing would best be left to John Rzeznik. Otherwise The Goo Goo Dolls relyon a swift mash of guitars and middle of the road lyrics.MichaelM,May 21/02"
2,Because only half the songs are good,"Most of the goo goo dolls famous songs, like ""Sympathy"" and ""Big machine"", were written by the band's frontman. These songs are great; I have no problem with them. But the other half of the album has songs written and sung by another band member, and they are truly horrible, unless you like corny sounding country rock/ballad music.When I heard the rest of the songs, I was really dissapointed. Maybe you might disagree, but I'm the kinda person who likes bands like The Shins, The Strokes, The Vines, The Hives, etc. Try any of the bands for much, much better music."
2,The bass Player should not sing,"This CD has a few good cuts from it buts its like most Goo Goo Dolls CD's, Only a couple good songs then the rest are [not good]. The songs that Robby (bass player) sings are terrible. I can't stand his voice and the songs seem to be ones that somebody left in the garbage can. I'm sorry to be so scathing, but I have to move on to the next song every time I hear his voice. Maybe its just my tastes, but thats how I feel. They should have waited another year or bought some songs from somebody. It does have a few good singles but over all I'm glad I didn't buy it and just downloaded it."
3,a goo goo delight,"My favorite album by the goos will always be ""a boy named goo"", a close second would be ""dizzy up the girl"". So what about ""gutterflower""? I think it stands up nicely to past efforts. I really dug the first three songs on the album, but as the thing progresses its light kind fades. The songs(although not bad) seem to lose the energy at the end. Dont get me wrong though, i really like this record, and it could still grow on me even more. I think its defintley worth the buy."
3,MIX REVIEWS ON GUTTERFLOWER,"I still have mix reviews of the cd. I do love ""THINK OF ME"". It has the up beat of ""SLIDE"" and ""JUST THE WAY YOU ARE"". Johnny's lyrics are much more intense and darker then on DUTG. Robby's songs tend to all sound alike. How ever, I continue to be a die hard GooGooDoll'S fan."
1,A big disappointment,"I had previously read, and definitely recommend, a book by the same authors ""Yes, You Can Still Retire Comfortably!"". It was straightforward, practical, to the point. And in that book, they referred many times to this earlier book of theirs. I thought ... wow! ... if these guys can make market timing as simple as they made retirement planning, the world is a wonderful place.I was wrong. Simple? Yes. Totally simple. But, let me save you the time. While making a convincing case, they ""prove"" that only a fool (and I do not mean that with a capital F) would have bought stocks since about 1984. If you believe that, buy this book.In short ... buy their retirement book. Skip this one."
2,You can successfully time the market?,"According to the backward looking evidence presented in this book - the answer is an unqualified yes. All you have to do is live to be 200 years old so that you can take advantage of the optimal buying opportunities that occasionally present themselves.Seriously, I bought this book because I enjoy Stein's humor, and there wasn't enough of it in evidence here. The techniques the authors advocate could have been expressed in a 15 page brochure and are basically useless to the typical investor with a 20 year accumulation period.Want to buy this book? Wait until it appears in the bargain basket at your local B&N or Borders Books. It won't be long before you can find it there."
2,No you cant !,"A good primer on analysis, moving averages, and cheap vs. expensive. There is a major hole in this book: When is it time to sell? You will find no analysis. Ben and Phil only make the case for when to enter a position in a S&P500; index fund, and when to avoid adding to the position. When the indicator suggests stocks are high, buy t-bills until the indicator changes.If you use one of the timing indicators to put money in, what about taking it out, thereby avoiding a ""reversion to the mean""? If you are only timing an entry and not an exit, you aren't timing... So in my opinion, NO you can't time the market (not by reading this book)."
2,This is one book I wish I didn't purchase,"The best aspect of this book is the ""common sense"" it provides regarding buying stocks/funds. However, in a nutshell, the authors recommend holding onto stocks/funds for 30 years. Unfortunately, I'm only 30 but even now at my tender age with all my investment years ahead of me, I wasn't convinced this is a book I want to trust for the next 30 years.The gains they talk about are hardly convincing. For example, using their approach would have gained 818% in thirty years HOWEVER had you simply done dollar cost averaging, etc you would have gained anywhere from 600-750%. It just depends on the years they were covering. I literally thought to myself...why go through 30 years of this if it will only result in that much difference. Their findings are interesting but not convincing or revolutionary enough to make me change my present investment approach...and I would be very surprised if anybody will be that affected by this book."
1,Astonishing!,"Astonishing that these highly educated authors have no idea what opportunity cost is. Their method of analysis is completely invalid; the market timer should not have the ability to double up on his investments if the regular investor cannot. If you can only save $1000 per month, how can you be investing $2,000? The answer, of course, is by borrowing money. Once you factor in the cost of borrowing that extra money into the authors' scenario, the entire market timing system collapses.It's also astonishing that the authors point out but gloss over the fact that their system would have kept your money out of the market for the past 20 years. Despite the bear market of '00-'02, the past two decades have been one great time to be in stocks."
4,Different definition of timing the market,"This timing is for when the total market is selling at higher than average total market prices. This timing will work, but it may take years for the timing to work."
3,"Obsolete. Not so many buy signals, either","There is some merit to this book. The authors highlight 4 buy signals. They say you can find these (updated) on their website, [...]. But you can't. S&P stopped publishing 3 of the indexes the authors rely on! Maybe you USED to be able totime the market, but it's much harder now."
2,Another tired you can beat the market book,"Some may be able to beat the market some of the time. But no one does all the time and the average person will do far better indexing. The evidence is overwhelming. But this idea of market timing will not die even after a terrible bear market such as the one we have been in. Unfortunately, when it comes to money, most never learn their lesson. Coming out of this bear market, many will be initially successful but over the long haul most will lag the S&P 500. This gets back to the idea that everybody can be a winner in the market and can beat the averages. Even though I believe in stock selection indexing is probably the way to go for those monies we will have to have in the future."
3,Good statement of the obvious,"This book is essentially a logical proof of an obvious statement, ""there are characteristics of a market that make it a good or bad time to buy stocks."" It looks only at long term timing such as might be advocated by Bob Brinker. It does not advocate and provides no method for timing which might find turning points more often than every few years. As a consequence, it is unlikely to lead to a stock trading methodology."
5,Awesome - blast from the past rockin into the future,"This record makes me feel like I used to feel when I put on a new Doughboys, or Big Drill Car record back in the day. I miss music that's this good. Adding the Descendents legendary rhythm section (Stevenson/Alvarez) was a wise move. They just might be the tightest and most skilled Drummer and Bassist to ever grace the pop-punk scene.This record gets better and better as you listen too. So don't listen once and judge it, though you might be hooked after one listen too.It's great to hear the Lemonheads again, and it's even better to hear them like THIS (fueled by Stevenson/Alvarez), oh and did I mention J Mascis' super ultra cool guitar work on this??This whole record really just brings back those SST and Cruz records days. Kudos. More, more, please Mr. Dando."
3,nice but nothing memorable,"Like when old friends get back back together and play in their old reharsal room..i'm an old fan of evan..and i think his solo album is better than this record..which contains a couple of great songs:steve's boy,no backbone(smug's cover..tom morgan's old band)..the rest is just routine without memorable melodies..way better than other records that could come out in these days..but why people should buy this instead of Ray or Lovey..???"
2,A Big Disappontment,Worse album Evan has made to date - sad to say given how excited I was for this to be released!!
3,"Mistake, Mistake, Mistake","Tako dugo sam cekao ovaj album i onda... Nista. Sam Bog zna koliko sam ga puta preslusao i pokusao da opravdam sve, ali nije uspelo. Od onog sto je trebalo da bude povratak godine, pretvorilo se u lep pokusaj za nista. Black Gown je zapravo jedini veliki favorit.Velika greska za jedan bend kakav su The Lemonheads."
3,too much money for what I get,"When I read the spec, it sounded like it can do a lot. After I got this product, it took me a while to try to figure out how to work it. Then I realized that it is not that accurate. I was hoping that this can also measure the body fat. When I went for the check up, the reading I got from the scale vs. the manual thing that was used to measure (sqeeue your flesh to go through that gadget) is too big a difference. Now, I do not trust that feature. So, the 3 star is for the scale itself, not to the boby fat measure side. Again, I can buy a scale for less than what I paid for. The design is okay."
4,Good price for a good product,"I ordered this because the price range fell into my budget. The machine does do pretty good with a few errors here and there. Sometimes, you have to step on it a few times to get a just reading on your bodyweight and body fat.Overall for the price paid it is a nice product to have."
3,Round Robin,Both of Jennifer Chiaverini's novels have been delightful. These books are wonderful for anyone with an interest or love for quilting. Reading either of them makes you feel you want to be an Elm Creek Quilter. I hope the author continues the stories of the group.
3,Round Robin,I felt that this book lacked some of the charm that her other books had. Maybe that is because it had some really deep issues in it which brought up sad memories for me. It made me cry in the end. I have since read 2 other books in this series and I am not disappointed. Jennifer's writing is always real and my rating is strickly personal.
3,A Quilter's Dream,"I am not a quilter, so a lot of the terms in this book were beyond me. I also did not read the first book in the series. The idea behind the book is a good one. They way six or seven women stitch their lives into a quilt, but there is just too much happening for one small quilting bee- potential infidelity, graduate school drop-out, marital breakdown, incapacitating strokes, misfit teenagers! Come on. I do like the way the various stories are woven together, though, but I too felt the ending was a bit weak."
3,Round Robin,The book it's self was ok -- the book was a great read loved it -- will save it to loan to quilting friends or new quilters
3,review,"Informative, entertaining, somewhat shallow characters but worth the price for a kindle. To each their own so you be the judge because I am just trying to full fill my twenty word limit."
4,Mind-bending!,"A wonderful book which really makes you think. This story answers a question which is put forth in the title ""How do you make a four-dimensional robin round in all ten dimensions?"" From Elm Creek of the present to the trans-Neputian Dyson sphere of the far future, this books manages to convey aspects of every human, and spatial dimension. A very odd mixture of the contemporary American woman novel combined with the tech-jam-packed novels of such as Stephen Baxter, this book may not be for everyone. However, I must state that I have never seen anything quite like it before. Highly recommended."
5,Round Robin,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book --- even more than I enjoyed Quilter's Apprentice. Jennifer has a real talent for capturing the feelings that we quilters share about our work and our families. The story is similar to How To Make An American Quilt, in that it shares a little vignette about each of the lead characters and their lives.I recommend this book highly to anyone who wants to read about quilters and their special connection to each other."
5,campy gothic fun,"Bette Davis and Olivia De Havilland, along with Joseph Cotton as a creepy, untrustworthy villain, turn in hilarious performances that will have you rolling on your rug. Davis plays a faded southern belle whose married lover was murdered with an ax decades ago. She is the primary suspect and has been ostracized by the community since then. In the great tradition of southern gothic, she is truly haunted by the past, and spends most of her time there.Overwrought, overacted, even over-plotted, this one is a don't- miss gem. Highly recommended."
5,"""From right here I could spit in your eye.""","This movie has got to be one of the best ever made! So what if the special effects are not up to the standards to which we have been spoiled by George Lucas, et al. The plot is engrossing, the characters are rich, and wonderfully acted by a legendary cast. Not to mention the fact that the film was shot at Oak Alley Plantation. One small correction, however, Joan Crawford was to play Miriam, however, she magically came down with the flu and refused to leave her trailer for 6 weeks on location, after finding out that she (Crawford) would not recieve top billing. Hence, Olivia Dehaviland (aka Melanie Wilkes) got to break out of the mold of the""mealy-mouthed ninny Melaine"" and sink her gifted teeth into the role of one of the coldest bitches ever captured on celluloid."
5,Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte,"Love this movie, but ordered for a friend who loves it even more!!! It's a classic!"
5,What A Twisted Tale Of Life-Long Deception!,"Davis and DeHavilland are truly at their best in this shocking thriller, set in the bayou country of Louisiana. The setting, the family dynamics, and the un-expected twists and turns in the story will keep your attention riveted to the screen. I enthusiastically recommend this movie to all lovers of Hollywood classics..."
3,Great Film/Ho Hum Commentary,"Anyone who grew up during the 60's and caught this on late night tv will recall this film with high nostalgia.Everyone else has summarized the story, so I'll pass. Sure there are plot holes and devices, but who cares.However, there is no excuse for substandard commentary, yet this film has it in spades. There are numerous factual errors,one of the most glaring is that the interior is a replica of Houmas House (it ain't)but worst of all, the commentary is just plain b-o-r-i-n-g. This film really deserved someone either deeply knowledgeable of cinema history, or a fun narrator to give listeners a heavy on the camp hootfest.It's a shame Fox Entertainment went on the cheap with this one."
4,Cannibal Time in Dixie,"This was the movie that was supposed to re-team Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, but Joan backed out shortly after filming began. Olivia DeHavilland is very effective, however, and is perfect as the underhanded Cousin Miriam. Agnes Moorehead about steals the show as Bette's servant and is a lot smarter than her ""Po White Trash"" character seems. In her later years, Bette Davis remarked that she hated this movie, but she was actually quite good - if a little over the top. It's a shame that Joan dropped out - the famous ""You're a vile, sorry little bitch !"" line that Bette shouts at Cousin Miriam would have been an appropriate epitath for the famous feud between the two Divas."
5,ONE OF THE BEST,"This is a kind of Baby Jane chill-out, but still a great piece. YOu can't say how this would have turned out had Joan Crawford not pulled out. Of course it would have been another camp fest, much more than this, but she was the original player. Even if both versions existed, you couldn't put them on the same level. Olivia and Joan would have played it very differently. You can't say one of them would have been better. Of course, looking back at it now, Olivia serves much better the role of evil cousin while we are used to seeing her in a positive way.Jane and Sidney recreated the ""dump-the-body + slap-in-car"" scene in a season finale of Melrose Place."
5,charlotte,"betty davis is the greatest in this movie, and i recomend it to anyone who is a fan of her's. c.schubert"
5,New DVD Doesn't Play,"The new edition of Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte simply will not play in my dvd player. It's a Zenith and about 5 years old, but it plays everything else, including new releases. But I have tried three different discs of this movie, and it's like my machine can't even read them. Nothing happens. Has anyone else had this experience, or know what could be causing the problem? Thanks in advance!"
5,Still creepy,A classic creepy psycho-thriller that will keep you awake. Who is the really crazy one? Is it Charlotte? Is there really a poltergeist who causes things only Charlotte can see? Bette Davis is at her domineering and twisted evil best in this classic. You will not wan to miss it.
4,All About Evil,"Eerie-scary macabre tour de force by two of the most talented acting forces from cinema's past,Bette Davis and Olivia de Havilland. This 1964 golden oldie finds aging spinster Davis doubting her sanity, still wondering if she actually beheaded and buried her lover years earlier. When her home is about to be razed by highway authorities(and her cellar dug up),cousin de Havilland tries to help stop them from unearthing the truth. But the truth isn't that simple, nor are her motives. In the style of 1962's ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" with both helmed by director, Robert Aldrich, and both murderouly intriguing."
3,"Great cast, so-so movie","Bette Davis plays the fragile title character in this movie, which feels like a cross betweenWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?andGaslight. It would have been nice to see Joan Crawford in the role of Bette's cousin, but her replacement, Olivia de Havilland, does a very good job. Her performance is very low key compared to Davis's campy (but good) scenery chewing. Agnes Moorehead steals her scenes as the maid Velma.So, the acting is great, and the movie has its good moments, but overall, it's way too long and slow moving. Worth watching for fans of the stars, like myself, but I was a little disappointed."
5,HELP ME FIND BETTE DAVIS MOVIE,"DONT REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE MOVIE...one scene i do remember she was stealing old people checks and killing them, she told one lady to look in a ditch then hit her in the head with a shover???? cant remember the name of this movie???"
2,OUT OF THE CLOUZOT...,"Anyone who holds dear the great 1955 french chiller ""DIABOLIQUE"" will be in for no surprises when viewing this film. The original H. G. Clouzot classic obviously ""inspired"" the Hollywood geniuses to attempt yet another virtual remake of a great European film. Always bigger, never better! The only real purpose of this rip-off was to find another vehicle for Bette Davis after her ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?"" re-birth. If you've never seen the original ""Diabolique"", you may like this movie. But your money would be better spent on the Criterion version of the great Clouzot original. Just be sure you don't confuse it with the more recent Hollywood disaster starring Sharon Stone and Chaz Palmetieri."
4,Hush...Hush Sweet Charlotte,"""Hush ...Hush Sweet Charlotte"" certianly isn't a sweet movie. But I enjoyed it even if I am not a big fan of this type of story. Of course Bette Davis and Joan Crawford made it a lot better."
1,Anger At Seller,"i sent the movie back because it was a gift for my mother and she already had it. The seller told me if i sent it back I would receive my money back so i sent back it on december 27, 2010 and I never got my money back."
5,Grand Guignol at its grandest,"Lurid, Creepy, atmospheric and ripe fit to burst. Satisfying revenge creepfest set in ol' Louisiana. Not to be missed."
5,Davis dominates this southern fried chiller,"Bette Davis attacks the role of tarnished southern belle Charlotte Hollis, a woman who's been haunted by demons in her past.Hush... Hush allows Miss Davis to display her formidable talents as both vixen and victim. Charlotte believes she is responsible for the violent death of her lover. When her cousin Miriam comes a-calling Charlotte thinks Miriam's there to help her hang on to her decaying gothic mansion.Charlotte soon begins hearing and seeing ominous things, which doesn't improve her fragile state of mind.The cinematography, score, and performances give this unsettling thriller a real jolt.The scenes with Bette and Olivia de Havilland (Miriam) near the finale are fabulous. Better still is the scene with Bette getting a terrible fright at the top of Charlotte's staircase. Awesome film starring the most compelling and versatile actress ever on film!"
4,Hush now and watch this old classic,"An involving, entertaining movie from Bette Davis' early 60's shocker/thriller period. Though it runs a little long, its southern-gothic plotline, high moments of melodrama, and lurid effects will likely keep you watching until the end. The economically-priced DVD gives you a nice sharp print of the film and a very informative, entertaining commentary track by internet film critic and essayist Glenn Erickson (also known as the ""DVD Savant"" at a popular DVD web site). After watching the film, it's definitely worth re-running it with Mr. Erickson's knowledgeable, anecdote-rich track playing. A nice little DVD all around."
3,Pee-Wee Herman Is Nowhere To Be Found In This 'Playhouse',"Playhouse is a horror-comedy that works a whole lot better as a comedy than as a horror movie. It's about people being murdered in a haunted playhouse. The inept detective on the case is absolutely hilarious and pretty much makes the movie worth sitting through. The horror elements didn't really do much for me, to be honest. Most of the deaths are off-screen and it's never really scary. See it for the detective."
2,Sandisk has discontinued these cards and are not replacing them under warranty,"I own this card and recently started having problems. When I called Sandisk and they have no stock to replace these cards. I am pretty ticked off at Sandisk. They should be able to replace this card under the three year warranty. They want me to return it and they will replace it with a 1 GB memory card, which is worthless as I really need the wifi portion, not the memory.Buyer beware.Note added 3/21/06...I have to give credit to Sandisk, after repeatedly calling (for six months) and escalating the problem, I did get a replacement. THANK YOU SANDISK! It was not the way it should have been in warranty position (6 months into a 3 year warranty). It was very much a hassle, but eventually worked out. Should hold me over until I purchase a new PDA with wireless built in. This is an excellent idea of combination unit, hope someone else picks up the idea."
1,256 MB + WiFi SD Card,This Product does NOT work with Windows Mobile 2003 second edition! No patches....No help from SanDisk!
2,"Ipaq 3955, no memory","I did get this to work in one way or another. In ce 2002 the memory showed up but no WiFi. I upgraded to CE2003 and the WiFi works, but no memory. The reason I bought this was that J&R expressly said it worked on the 3955. I am a bit disappointed that it isn't fully functional, but the WiFi works, so I guess I will keep it. I hope they update the drivers, but after talking to Sandisk, I am not holding my breath. They weren't too interested in helping me."
1,Terrible return policy.,"Sandisk will not refund your money. I purchased the card based on the table of compatabilities from their website. They said it was compatable with my PDA. After 3 days of trying to get it to work, I e-mailed Sandisk for help. They told me it was not compatable. I e-mailed them the table showing it was compatable and asked for return instructions. They refused to refund my money."
2,Doesn't work with Audiovox 6600,"Two stars for the idea of the product. But execution is lacking. After reading the reviews here, I checked the compatibilty chart on the Audiovox web site. And after verifying my device was listed, I ordered one. To my huge disappointment it would not work. Neither as a storage card nor a Wi-Fi card. I contacted SanDisk support and they said there were known problems with this card and the Audiovox 6600, engineering was reviewing and that it ""may be"" pulled from the compatibility chart. A little Microsoft R&D there? Ship it and then work out the bugs? Anyway, if they ever get the issues resolved I will buy again. Combo card is the way to go."
1,Not work on HP iPAQ 3955,"It not work on my hp 3955.I was call HP 3 times,but I get the difference answer every time.,finally they told me the negative answer.And told me my PDA was out of guarantee,need to call the tech. support with charge .($$$)( They care about customer pay them only,don't care about what is the customeron feeling)sandisk was give me the answer fast than HP. (it was not work on it card w/memory ,but it was too late )Some one told we don't check the website before we buy it, but it was hard to get the answer sometime.before I order it card,I was read the review from someone on amazon site to told ,it was working on hp 3955,but it was not !!"
2,Disappointing,"This would be the book for you if you were interested in a general book about dog care with many nice pug pictures. The general section (the vast majority of the book) is reasonably well done. However, the section specific to the breed was shockingly short, was filled with ""cutsie"" pleasantries, and lacked useful content. It should have been titled ""Dog Care and Maintenance, With a Preface in Praise of Pugs."""
1,not what was marketed,This product was marketed as Body Shop Indian Gardenia but it is nothing like it. I should have known when I saw the image but figured it was cheap enough to give it a try. Not certain if it is Amazon or Sunshine that is responsible for the mistake in marketing.
1,"It's a long way to the top, and Sarina isn't there yet","My parents gave me this book hoping I could find a leader to guide me. I am sorry to say this wasn't the book. From the first chapter where she compares herself to the President elect Bill Clinton is comical to dull chapters that tell pointless stories about herself. This is self-indulgent and the reader is better off seeking a mentor somewhere-else. Five stars for narcissism, zero stars for entertainment or usefulness."
5,A guidebook to master fundamentals of leading a business,"Sarina has combined revealing personal stories with classic entrepreneur methods to create a guidebook for people who want to achieve more in life, through business. The book is well balanced and unique because it mentions areas not normally covered in this genre: relationships, heroes, self rewards. For overall comprehensiveness,I consider it the best book in my business library."
2,What went wrong?,"Plot description on this book's Amazon.com page. I really wanted to like this book, but I could just about finish it. Why? I expected these men--of the Free Fellows League to be older. The heroine is in her second season, so I assume she is about 19. None of these characters worked for me. They all seemed to be self-involved and only concerned for the now. He gets wounded and comes back from the war--and whine, whine, depression. The author could have done so much more with these characters.At the start of this book the friends are at school and make this pledge-to form the Free Fellows League complete with rules. Talk about not growing up--just about the entire last half of the book is about why our hero can't love his wife because of some dumb rules he made up as a teenager. And also because he ""isn't good enough for her"". I realize that the reader has to take into consideration the timeframe of this book, but enough already. Too much angst, whining and boredom."
1,The spanish galleons and the Spanish atlantic fleets made globalization possible,"For more than 250 years the Spanish galleons connected Manila and Acapulco whilst the Atlantic Fleets connected Veracruz with Seville, in all that time only four Manilla galleons were captured by British or Dutch pirates and only one Atlantic Fleet was destroyed in open battle. And all the author has to say is that the galleons were defeated by England at the Armada battle in 1588.Well, in 1589 and even larger English navy, the Drake- Norris expedition was destroyed by the Spanish thus ensuring the survival of the Spanish Empire for another two hundred years."
5,Valuable information,"Excellent review of the changeover in naval power. Author writes in a clear, readable style that is easy to read and understand. Highly recommend to those intrerested in expanding their knowledge of history."
5,An Important Read,"I thoroughly enjoyed this work. Prominent scholars examine the importance and sanctity of traditional marriage with respect to their fields- philosophy, economics, law, etc. If you are concerned with the current state of marriage in this society, this is a must read!"
1,"Be careful, this is crap!",The DVD has no menue - it is not 90 minutes long - it is 45.The few Trailer running up to three times to fill the 45 minutes.Sometimes a Trailer runs double -Bad quality also - better save your money -And the producers should be ashamed of this!!!
4,Great Players Together,I have wanted the song Manha De Carnaval for a long time. I found it on this album and it is a very good version. I have listened to all three guitar players in the past and find this album very interesting if you like South American sounding guitars.
5,"""The Guitar Trio"" is a follow-up of "" Passion, Grace & Fire""","I have both CD's. Three extremely virtuous guitarists giving the very best of themselves. What musical conversations, what interplaying! You are so impressed and motivated you end up on the roof! And it sure takes a while for you to return to mother earth, that's for sure. Each guitarist gives the best he has to offer, it's plain guitar-jamming! I wish nothing ever happens to those hands and 'golden fingers'. And please give us another one of those, before you plan to retire!"
5,"Funny, funny, funny","The best use of sarcasm and humor to highlight the pains of life, and especially of growing up, that I've ever seen. I never thought I'd write a review but this book put me over the edge. You're missing a lot if you don't read it."
3,Surprisingly Disappointing,"This is my first audiobook and thus my first experience with the effect live narration has on text. I will say that every other David Sedaris essay I have read has been uproariously funny. I read both Holidays on Ice and Me Talk Pretty One Day.This book wasn't as funny. I enjoyed the honest and heartfelt coming out story of ""I Like Guys"". However, many of the essays were sad or even boring. I felt myself wishing the segment would be over so I could see if the next one would be funnier. I had no idea David's childhood had been so painful. I guess this just wasn't what I expected from the author of Holidays On Ice.I cannot gauge if I may have found it more entertaining to read than to listen to."
2,Not my kind of humor,"I read Naked on the recommendation of a great many people, and it may be because it was so highly recommended that I was somewhat let down. After being told time and again how clever and funny David Sedaris' writing was, I found it amusing at best, but never particularly enlightening or knee-slappingly funny.Naked is, simply, a collection of autobiographical essays relating to various events in Sedaris' life -- the years he lived with his grandmother, a youthful trip to Greece, adventures in hitchhiking and, as the capper, a visit to a nudist resort. Some of the stories are quite funny, others less so. A few are downright maudlin. There's nothing wrong with any of them, but I was never particularly engaged either -- chalk it up to personal taste. I don't really get into nonfiction unless I find the author or the subject matter particularly engaging. In the case of Naked, the author and subject matter are the same thing, and it's just not something I got excited about."
4,Good Book,"Naked was a pretty good book. Lots of laugh-out-loud moments. I like other books of his better. This one seems a little slower, but still quite funny."
3,"Good, but not as good as his others","After reading Me Talk Pretty Someday, I was expecting more laughing-till-I-was-crying stories. Most of these are much heavier and longer. Still has its moments, but this one won't make you look ridiculous laughing out loud on public transportation."
4,Hilarious and Original. A Very Good Read.,"This was the first book I've read by David Sedaris. It does not disappoint. His stories range from laugh-out-loud to cringeworthy, and are nothing if not original. I really enjoyed reading his various tales, told with just enough sarcasm and self-deprecation. I look forward to reading his other books.His writing reminded me of another gay humorist/memoirist Wade Rouse. His bookAt Least in the City Someone Would Hear Me Scream: Misadventures in Search of the Simple Lifeis absolutely hilarious. Made me spit out my milk one morning. I also recommend Chuck Klosterman's books likeFargo Rock City : A Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural North Dakota. All of these are perfect to read on a long plane flight! It's just the person sitting next to you might think you're strange as you break out laughing."
3,"A little disappointing after ""Pretty""","I was a little disappointed with ""Naked"" after reading ""Me Talk Pretty"". Sedaris' trademark style is there, but as the book takes us through his days of boozing and drugging, all the way over to the punchline (the nudist camp) - the entire experience has an aimless voyeur feel to it. Some stories don't really go anywhere and in general the book is not as laugh-out funny as ""Pretty"". However, the essay about Sedaris' mother's death is bittersweet; for a man who usually doesn't dwell on the emotionalism of his *characters*, the emotional impact of that essay came through in a very strong way for me."
5,Brilliant!!!,"I started this book not knowing what to expect, but from the first page, I was absolutely enthralled. Sometimes I would start howling with laughter in the most inappropriate places (restaurants during lunch, etc.) and people would want to know what I was reading about. My answer was always, ""you have to read it for yourself."" No words can adequately describe it because I think that everyone will get something different from it despite the fact the the humor is universal. Mr. Sadaris' biting wit cut to the core of my being. The man has a natural talent. I can't wait to read his future works, but Naked will always be one of my all-time favorite pleasurable experiences. You GO, Boy!!"
5,HAEL YEAHH - CAN'T WAIT FOR HIS NEXT BOOK,"This book is my new Litmus Test to give to people. If they don't like, I want nothing to do with them."
2,Rather Dissapointing,"I contemplated purchasing this book for quite a while but coulnd pull the trigger. Finally after reading ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius"" by David Eggers, I was recommended this book. I didn't find any of the stories funny. And considering the reviews on Amazon I was disappointed. Nothing ever reached out and grabbed me with this book. The stories just seem run of the mill. I would suggest Eggers' book if you want a truely entertaining memoir."
3,Needs to learn female anatomy before writing about it.,"""Shaved VAGINA?"" (When writing about a woman at a nudist camp). I believe you mean vulva. You don't shave a vagina. That and a few other mistakes made me put this down before I finished it. How does this get by editors? I just felt embarrassed for him. I have also been disturbed by the descriptions of animal suffering in a couple of his books recently. Not funny. I think I'm done with this author."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this book from Amazon specifically off of the great reviews. It was said to be hilarious and side-splitting. I did find some parts amusing, but for the most part I found my self skimming to just finish the book."
3,A pretty good book,"I think that this is a great book for travel. It is a quick read with a lot of amusing moments in it. Sedaris' style is self-depricating and quick witted, and I believe he as a gift for hyperbole. I didn't find this book to be as hilarious as everyone else, apparently. There were passages which caused me to laugh, but overall, I thought that the book had a lot of what would be outright depressing subjects; it is only because of the author's tongue-in-cheeck style that these topics were manageably wrangled into fodder for amusement."
3,Good...not great,"I guess because I had read so many raving reviews of this book I had expected more. I did have a giggle every once-in-a-while, but not enough to have LOVED this book."
4,Truly hilarious.,"David Sedaris is a very funny writer and this is one of his better collections. I highly recommend it. Though my favorite among his books is still the gut-splitting ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"", this collection comes fairly close to matching it. Prepare to laugh hysterically throughout.Archived episodes of the radio program, This American Life, contain portions where Sedaris reads some of the stories in these collections, and they are really well worth tracking down and listening to."
3,Timely but poorly packaged,"There was no issue with the book - BUT - the envelope was too small so the corners ended up folded. The delivery timing was great but no packing slip, too small an envelope and a NEW book made only fair by the too small of an envelope"
3,Good for Leisurely Reading,This book has a new story in each chapter.Some chapters are hilariousSome chapters are lacking any humor I would find funnyI definately would reccommend this book to lighten your mood or put a smile on your face.this is not the type of book you need to read cover to cover.you can pick and choose what you want to read.
3,Maybe he's just not for me,"After the first two chapters of this book, I thought, wow, this is hilarious! Unfortunately, after that the humor died down, in my opinion.I appreciated the unique stories that Sedaris had to share, they made this book worthwhile. However, a lot of his humor just plain fell short on me. I also struggled to understand his reasoning for writing this book, for piecing these stories together as he did, and what exactly was his ""point""?I can see from the other reviews I'm in the minority here. Even my sister who recommended this book, is a huge fan. But for me, while it was an average read, I don't think Sedaris is an author for me. I am not in the least bit interested in picking up another book of his."
2,Humorous? More warped than funny.,"Those who found this entertaining or humorous must be warped or disturbed individuals. The events are obviously exaggerated and intentionally absurd, bordering on psychotic. I also found several inconsistencies that made me think I had misplaced my page and was re-reading the same chapter by mistake. Definately not the light laugh I was expecting."
3,A Slow Decline,"I used to love Sedaris. I loved 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' and loved the articles he wrote for the 'New Yorker.' Unfortunately, over time, I would argue he has traded in his natural penchant to make insightful and witty comments about everything for the type of shock value writing that has been gaining popularity in the memoir genre (much like Borroughs and Eggers). In 'Naked,' Sedaris seems to have abandoned the type of subtle commentary that causes us as readers to laugh out loud and turned to using only the outrageousness of the given situation or anecdote to win us over. His treks through the United States and stories of his father's useless advice just don't sparkle the way his previous writing does. The only strong essay is the last one, 'Naked' where he delves into his one week at a nudist colony. I long for the days when memoir writing was humorous in a subtle manner, instead of using absurdist plots and life stories to get me interested. Pass on this and read his older work."
5,This should be your first Sedaris book,"If the following quote doesn't make you want to read this book, then you're a little crazy.""Test eye shadow on all the rabbits you want. Strap electrodes to the skulls of rhesus monkeys and shock them into a stupor, but it is inhumane to place a nudist on horseback the day after a chili cook-off.""My favorite essays: ""True Detective,"" ""Dinah, the Christmas Whore,"" ""Ashes,"" and ""Naked.""Can't wait to read another one!"
1,Very disappointing - very little humor,This book is a sad commentary on an extremely dysfunctional family whose members all need help. To attempt to find humor in such a family suggests that the author needs help most of all! I found this book to be very disturbing and not at all funny.
3,Naked,"Love David Sedaris and would love this book too, but there were random pages torn out. I was missing a large chunk of the story so I just quit reading it and threw it away. However, if all the pages had been entact it would be a great book."
1,NOT FUNNY!,"This was my first David Sedaris book, and I bought the audio version. I had high hopes considering the rave reviews everywhere, but was very disappointed to find out that this book was far from funny. This book is sad and depressing! There is nothing funny about a child with OCD, or losing your mother to cancer, or having a dysfunctional family. I laughed once through this entire book, and I couldn't wait for it to end."
3,"""Clever"", but not really that funny.","I had at least 3 different people recommend this book to me. I just kept being told how unbelievably funny David Sedaris was. So I finally picked up this book and checked it out. Honestly, it really wasn't that funny. Each chapter is a separate story unto itself, each from a different time period in his life. They were fairly interesting stories, and really not bad, but ""hilarious""? No way. Not even close. I can't think of any time where I even more than just chuckled. I don't know, maybe it's not my type of humor. I just don't get what all the fuss is about. Most likely won't be reading another of his novels, there's more important things out there, and honestly, these random stories don't say much of anything really important."
4,Definite Improvement after Barrel Fever,"Naked by David SedarisIn Barrel Fever, David Sedaris had not yet decided if he wanted to write essays or stories. In Naked, he recognizes his talent for semi-autobiographical pseudo-memoirs and dumps the stories.Sedaris also matures here in that he slowly moves outside of himself and gives center stage to other people and their concerns. ""A Plague of Tics"" and ""Ashes,"" for example, are powerful reflections on Sedaris' mother.The reader should still expect to read a lot about Sedaris. Yet he surrounds himself with odd situations, characters, and plots, and you get a more complete feeling (than in Barrel Fever) of the world in which Sedaris' idiosyncrasies have been forged.Not all of the essays are perfect, but there are enough to keep you intellectually, comically, and mournfully engaged to make the entire text worth reading."
4,"Funny but ""raw""","I love listening to David Sedaris on ""This American Life"" and think he's very funny, smart and clever. This is the first book of his I've read, and I was not disappointed. Most of the stories are side-splittingly funny, but there are a few that are almost too emotional or raw for my taste. Not too crude or unpleasant, just too personal, I think. I don't think I've ever read a book that was more aptly titled. Some of the stories (and all of them are great and well-written) just made me feel like he was baring himself (emotionally or psychologically) in a way I had not anticipated, and it was just a bit more than I bargained for. It won't stop me from reading some of his other books, though."
5,A WONDERFUL AUDIO BOOK,"This book on audio download is wonderful because the stories are hilarious and insightful, and so very honest. It's amazing how David looks at the most serious of subjects through a lens of humor and it works!The audio book is read by David Sedaris and that makes it much more personal and effective. I couldn't stop listening!"
5,Powerful,"This is a very funny book, so funny that I shed tears of fun throughout the time that I read it. The title ""Naked"" is itself enticing, and reading the book offers no regrets for making the choice.The stories are excellently written with characters that are intuitively observed. The stories are laced with humorous lines and the flow is so smooth that it makes reading effortless.The plots are equally plot that is breath taking. Overall, the style reminds me of other works like The usurper and other stories, House of the Dead, White Fang. I found the stories hilarious and witty. They are also pager turners."
4,"Very Funny, Could not put it down","David Sedaris gives us a very revealing look at his flawed dysfunctional life in a way that has you laughing.Never having a ""Woe is me"" attitude, Sedaris arm chair quaterbacks a lot of his decisions with hilarious observations. He comes across as a likeable but flawed guy, not really sure of where or if he fits in. He never takes himself, or anything else too seriously.It makes you realize that life is never as bad as you think, or as good.I will definately buy the other books by him."
5,Saying good-bye to a new found friend,"You can't help but think about your own memoirs while reading ""Naked"". The stories are painfully personal. You laugh, whince, fear, with David as he tells you the many facets of his own life experiences. Of course by the time you finish the book, he has brought many of your own life experiences back to the surface. Closing the back cover of the book, I couldn't help but feel like I was saying good-bye to a new found friend. I have not only read his ""secrets"" but have also relived some of my own. Not to worry though, I will order ""Me talk pretty some day"" and continue my own life revealing journey."
1,"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!",This book was absolutely disgusting. I could NOTHING redeeming about his family. He is a much too tortured soul to enjoy hearing his inner most thoughts! I love to read to escape reality and this book smears my nose in it over and over again!
1,Annoying,An annoying disjointed book. I didn't enjoy reading it. The author jumps from one bad anecdote to another. How this is humor beats me!
2,A sense of humor that is sometimes sick,"This is the first book I have read by this author, and was hoping to find a light sense of humor; instead, I found his sense of humor to be irreverent and sometimes bordering on sick."
3,Sarky friutcake!!!!!!,he's a real nutbar is David. he goofs around and is a bit phony but thats okay. his mother died. he wears pink ladies jackets sometimes. not sure about the Christian bit mind. stash box for anyone?
4,Amusing,"Not hilarious as suggested by other readers, but amusing in every way. Written in a frank, straight forward way, you can almost imagine you are sitting next to David as he goes about his crazy life. The first chapter was off-putting for me and I ended up reading it last instead of first and it made a whole lot more sense for me in that order. I'll read more of his books for sure!"
4,A hilarious Book!,"This book caught me quite off guard. My sister had been telling me about this author David Sedaris for a while and she got me a copy of Naked for Christmas one year. It took me some time to read it and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I trust my sister's taste in books but I had never really read a humorous book before so I didn't know what to expect. Sedaris's quirky and self indulgent humor caught me completely off guard and I actually found myself laughing out loud, something I rarely do when reading. The thing that I love about his writing style too is that I find he has a good blend of mixing humor and very moving little portraits of people (mostly his beloved dysfunctional family) without becoming sappy or cliched. My only gripe with this book was that a few of the stories pace dragged a bit, so I couldn't give it a five star rating. But on the whole, it is a great title that should be picked up by those who want a good laugh."
4,rip roaringly humorous,"Is David misanthropic, self pitying and dysfunctional? Yep. Is he funny? You betcha. The first time I read Naked, I laughed until my sides ached. Lighten up, naysayers- comedy ain't pretty."
2,NAKED,"Found the book NAKED unbelieveable. If that was humor, it wasn't my type of humor. Wasn't interested enough to read the entire book."
3,Good Read,"It's a good read to pass the time, but I thought his book Me Talk Pretty One Day was much more entertaining."
2,Not my kind of book. d.Submit Naked,"Felt he had some gems he could have developed, but got hung up in the gay business, which got old fast."
3,"Funny, but really?","This was my second Sedaris read after Me Talk Pretty One Day. He is eccentric and funny and a good writer. But no one lives a life like this, do they? Is it possible that many crazy things happened to one person who isn't even 60 yet? I dunno. It did get several out loud guffaws out of me, though. Overall liked."
3,Sad and Depressing,"Although the book was well written and did contain many witticisms, I found the book to be sad and depressing. The stories of a lonely grandmother, psychiatric wards, and a father consumed with golf, left me feeling mournful for this family, and turned my thoughts to the darker side of life. Unfortunately, I was expecting a light-hearted look at an adolescent's growing pains that might have made me laugh at some of my own background and given me a connection to the author and other readers."
5,Non-stop laughs!,"Sedaris goes where no-one should go in literature, but it works. I do have a guess as to who was shitting on the bathroom towels, though. It is a book you can read over & over."
5,"Sharp-witted, laugh-out-loud funny stuff.","David Sedaris has several things going for him. For starters, his life has been filled with unique adventures that make great launching pads for his essays on the American experience. He also brings a -- oh, forget it. It's very, very, very, funny stuff, and he can turn a phrase like nobody's business. Buy it. If you have a sense of humor, you'll eat it up."
4,Always a Star,"Sedaris is a cult classic. Although this book is not `Me Talk Pretty One Day' it has its own merit. Sedaris' whit and humor are refreshing and have made a huge impact on the idea of the memoir. It should not go without notice that many memoirs, including Burroughs, have been compared to Sedaris."
5,David Sedaris is genius,I agree with another reviewer. This book is one that you want to share yet you want to keep it to yourself.Being from the same area the Mr. Sedaris grew up I enjoyed this book even more so because of the landmarks that he described.You will laugh out loud when reading this book. He keeps you interested the entire time!
4,Sedaris -- Rights of Passage,"I first heard David Sedaris on WBEZ's ""This American Life."" He read an exerpt from his book Naked and I was curious to read more of his novel. Naked is one of the funniest books I've ever read! The essays in the book deal with Sedaris's passage into adulthood. Although, the book loses it's luster in the middle, it does pick up near the end."
2,"funny start, creepy finish","The first part of Naked I found hilarious, especially the the Sedaris mother with her frosty hair, Dinah the Chirstmas whore, and the mystery of who is using the household towels as toilet tissue. But as soon as the book went into the hitchhiking it got really creepy and never got back its offbeat humor for me, just disturbed me. I recommended tuning into the author's sister Amy on Comedy Network's ""Strangers With Candy Instead""."
1,Naked,Worst book I've ever read. Sedaris happily describes a sad and pathetic life as if it is either enviable or humorous - and it is neither!
1,Not engrossing at all,"I agree with the reviewer from Boston below. I was very enthused about reading this book when I purchased it; it looked great. I took it on a flight from Chicago to Tokyo. It didn't last past Minnesota. In fact, I considered leaving it on the plane. The incidents were not amusing nor interesting. It was a big disappointment."
1,So Bad I Threw it Away,"I just plain didn't like this book. I thought that both the humor and the writing style were very weak. I read the first two chapters, skimmed through the rest, then pitched it in the trashcan. If there was a rating lower than one star I would have selected it."
1,Side Splitting???,"One reviewer rated this as `side splitting'. I totally disagree. Don't get me wrong ... I, too, am a fan of David Sedaris, but not of this particular piece of work. In fact, I'm now feeling pissed at myself for spending $11.95 for this boring story; especially since I'm unemployed. Even without any outside distractions, I could not stayed focused on Naked. Take my advice and save your hard earned money."
2,How sad and humorless!,"I can't believe the ratings that other readers have given this book. What a waste of money and time. Sedaris has no sense of humor, he is just pure obnoxious! Please don't waste your money....Come and pick up my book for free, I mean it!"
2,Repetitive,The stories in this book become repetitive. The story(ies) is(are) funny but only for so long.
3,Not as funny as everybody says it is,"This book is not strictly an autobiography, but rather a compilation of life stories that are not necessarily funny.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book, but I am surprised that it is marketed and reviewed as some kind of humorous gay memoir. Although some stories were very entertaining, I finished the book with a sense of sadness. It is hard to take it as a comedic book when you are basically presented with a life of a loser (at least that what it seemed to me) who does not only have OCD, but takes drugs, almost gets raped, and lacks total general direction in life.Having said that, it is a very well written book which reminded me in style Salinger's works."
4,A funny and bizare look at growing-up.,"I loved this book!!! I have to admit I was drawn to the book by its cover. However, it was David Sedaris's writing that made it impossible to put it down. This histerical look into David Sedaris's funny, yet bizare childhood made me both laugh and want to call my parents and tell them I love them. The one thing that stood out through ""Naked"" was that, no matter how weird things got, his heart was always in the right place (well...for the most part). I can't wait to read Mr. Sedaris's other novels."
4,Out-loud Belly Laughs,"I bought this book to read on a quiet day alone at the beach. After 15 pages, the other beachgoers must have thought me mad, for I was sitting by myself guffawing at Sedaris' wacky characters and situations. If you don't laugh out loud at the 7-page essay ""Cyclops,"" check your pulse: you may be dead."
5,don't read this in public.,"oh I loved this book, I read it in Chicago when I was on the train to work. Bad idea, it was so hard not too laugh, I was red in the face. Several people gave me this nod, like they knew why I was laughing.Very funny."
2,"Hmmm...well, this one reader just didn't get it.","Ok. The string of raves from Amazon customers and the press alike convinced me to get, um, Naked. And I swear unto you, I am a funny guy. I like to laugh. I like humor. Really. Just plain didn't find this book funny, or even readable for that matter. Well, just found it kinda tedious, overwrought, whatever, anything but funny.So I don't get it, and it must be my own defect. What's so funny about this yawner? The same things people describe here as evoking of various rolling and emitting, well, I read the same thing and found it all boring. Controversy makes the world go round...decide for yourself I guess..."
4,"Painful to read, mostly plotless, but entertaining","The seventeen short stories in this book are entertaining and make for a fun read, but they mostly revolve around the humiliation and embarassment of the author. On more than one occasion the author ends up hiding in a ditch while others are searching to beat him up. It pains me to think that these tales actually occurred.Most of these stories do not have plots nor any closure, since they're simply the retelling of past events, and as a result I was bored with many of them. My favourite, by far, was ""Something For Everyone,"" which had well-developed characters, revealed the author's deepest impression of himself, and (unfortunately) ended in a humiliating tragedy.In summary, this book is recommended but requires a fair amount of wincing."
3,Off the deep end,"David Sedaris is a complete freak. (Not that that's a bad thing.) The stories he tells in ""Naked"" are so outlandish that you'll wonder how a guy can make this stuff up. Of course, it's only partially made up. Sedaris's essays are autobiographical and the characters he describes are surely based on real people. It's all pretty funny. And if a story or two falls flat, don't worry -- the next one will probably be a winner. I enjoyed reading the book, and zipped through it in no time. My only quibbles are that the salty language is sometimes overdone (e.g., see pp. 154-5) and that the humor can get a little old. Too much Sedaris is exhausting. But ""Naked"" in small doses is ideal."
4,You'll get shushed right out of the library with this one,"David Sedaris' memior, Naked, is easily one of the funniest books currently in print. I had purchased it about a year ago and it sat on my shelf until last week. Walking to lunch, I ran into a coworker who was laughing hysterically while noshing on a sandwhich and chips at our office deli. It turns out that she was reading Naked. I must say her laughter was infectious as she read me a passage and it was decided - Naked would be my next read.The book is a collection of essays chronicling Sedaris' upbringing with 5 other siblings and his wild and sometimes crazy parents. Sedaris covers his adolesence and early adulthood with wit, sarcasm and a few poignant moments. But mostly, it's a rip-roaring good read. Pick it up and grab a box of kleenex - you'll be laughing that hard."
4,"A doppelganger of a book: half good, half bad.","The first half of Naked is hilarious; so much so that you tell your friends that they must read the book when you're done. However, by the time you're done with the book, you'll want to provide the second half to your enemies. So, I rate the first half a ""10"" and the second half a ""3"", giving a combined average of ""7"". Don't be afraid to put this book down when the pace begins to falter. The author never regains his stride and, in the figurative sense, collapses a good 50 pages before the finish line. It teaches us the lesson we would never believe as adolescents: even naked won't sustain our interest forever"
5,You'll buy it... but you won't keep it.,"The only thing I can say to express how much I love this book is: Buy two. Mine has been passed around to at least seven of my friends. It is so funny, clever and at times, tender that you'll want everyone you care about to experience it as well. Buy this book -- No, buy two."
4,I love this man!,"David Sedaris has got to be one of the funniest writers on the scene. I have tapped my head for awhile as to why that is and it came to me: he focus on relatable subjects that are not funny and makes light of them. He allows us as readers, to see his vulnerablity and make fun of it with him. Good stuff, if you like the book I recommend the audio tape, he reads it himself so his humor and sarcasm are very sharp."
4,Weekend Book,"I read this when it first came out, finding it in my college bookstore. Usually I don't find myself reading something nonstop but I read this until my eyelids felt heavy and then kept on till the end. It was so funny I had to read it a second time as well. It was great reading a book that wasn't required..."
2,"A Strange and Interesting Life, but Not Necessarily Funny","I'd say this book was ""O.K."". I didn't find it particularly funny, but the characters portrayed are rather interesting. If the tales are true, the author has certainly had some strange and sad passages in his life. Many of the paths he travels in this book are paths I've never seen, so it was interesting to read about the odd journey."
2,"If you've read Barrel Fever, this one's a bore.","""Barrel Fever,"" Sedaris' first book, is original, daring, hysterically funny, and very queer. In ""Naked,"" Sedaris has succumbed to an ailment common to humorists who've written one good book. Known in some circles as ""Woody's Disease,"" the writer, having achieved some acclaim, imagines that readers should find windy diary accounts of his very ordinary personal experiences funny. Naked barely rises to amusing, much less funny. The savage queerness that gave the first book it's best lines has evaporated into vapid middle-class air. Don't be a codependent. You'd get more laughs out of a fifth reading of Barrel Fever than the first reading of this nakedly commercial offering."
3,"Humorous, Sarcastic, Dark and Well Read","The below is a review of the abridged audiobookBased on this listeners previous experiences with David Sedaris' audiobooks (this reviewer has heard quite a few), this book is pretty much epitomizes them. It is quite biting and sarcastic in its humor as well as being quite dark. The book is well read by David and Amy Sedaris and is read in a manner that reflects this well. However, the book just lacks the humor and bite that some of Sedaris' other books, such as Holidays on Ice, had. Hence three stars."
5,Naked,He is one of the funniest writers I have ever read. I truly love his books. Have read almost all of theml LOL all the way through.
3,Witty & Clever but at times mundane,"Some of the essays are entertaining, others sincere, most funny, but several were just plain boring. A whole essay about a kid who walks around, licking lightbulbs and counting his steps? That's a premise that Sedaris could've done somthing more with. I've read other Sedaris books. He gets better with age. If you haven't read Sedaris, don't start with Naked."
5,Real life is stranger than fiction.,"Hey reader in New York! You're the one coming off as a self-important blowhard! ""Naked"" is first rate comedy, or perhaps tragi-comedy, and there is nothing you can say to sway my opinion. This is Sedaris' book, not yours, and the events that he describes in this book are from his perspective. He just tells it as he saw it, and he sees things in a very particular way. I see him as a person who can't live any other way than the way he does. So he got famous! Big deal, the poor guy worked as an Elf at the age of thirty or so. Would you do that?"
4,I finally read something everyone is reading......,"I first heard David Sedaris on public radio reading ""The Santaland Diaries"". I nearly ran off the road laughing so hard, and then went around trying to explain to friends and family exactly how funny it is to hear a grown man imitate Billie Holiday. Everyone gave me a perplexed look and an answer that implied that I had the stupidest sense of humor around. A couple years have passed and now the very same people and grabbing me and saying, ""You have to read this book by David Sedaris...."" Well, they're right. It's hilarious. And I finally feel like I can participate in the conversations at parties."
5,Wonderful and hard to put down,"If you've ever heard David Sedaris on ""This American Life"" you know his thought provoking and funny style. The book is no exception. It's part hitch-hiking story, part growing up drama and part employment memoir. The sum of the stories add up to touching and emotional portraits of growing up in America. In short, many of us have had the same experiences.The final chapter on visiting a ""Nudist Camp"" is truly brilliant. I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks. If you grew up in America or would like to know what it's like to have done so read this book."
4,Laugh Out Loud Funny,"This book was my second adventure into Sedaris's work, my first being ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"". I enjoyed that book, but I have to say that ""Naked"" was even better. This book had me laughing out loud on such a regular basis, my boyfriend must have thought I was crazy! As with the other book, I feel that the strongest points in the book are toward the beginning, and the story slows down as you reach the end. However, this book starts off at such a fast pace, you won't mind the slowdown. This is a book that any fan of Sedaris MUST read, and everyone else should give it a try as well. Funny, eye opening, and clever...check it out."
3,oddities everlasting,"After living vicariously through Sedaris while reading this book I feel pretty maxed out in the odd encounters department. This book has strong moments indeed, especially when Sedaris is concocting piercing one-liners which he, of course, is too scared to speak out loud. It sags, too, as I guess too much of all-things wacky can get a little overbearing. As to whether these events are ""largely true,"" that is to be decided. But I think what makes ""Naked"" work is that Sedaris uses such a gifted storytelling device. We all have tales to tell---it's just a matter of how we choose to tell them. I'm sure we hear off-the-wall comments and see some strange happenings every day. But the time we take to really pay attention and immerse ourselves in that world is too little to realize a story lurks within. Sedaris seems to rely on these subtle moments, which he then amplifies---and does, in the end, get some laughs."
1,Sucked!,"I was really hoping for some good chuckles on my hour long commute to work. This didn't give me any chuckles. It was more cringe worthy than anything. I'm hoping his other stuff is better and will give it a try, but I would recommend skipping this one."
2,Don't be sold on the hype.,"David Sedaris has a rather common gift of quiet observance. He can take these observations and pepper them with funny quips and one-liners. But he is unable to write a story worth coming back to. Once you get past the formula of making every other sentence a sarcastic oberservation, there is really nothing worth mentioning.'Naked' leaves you wondering, ""Why was this book written?"" It has its funny moments, but none of the stories themselves are funny. There are no meaningful insights, save the occasional ""and here's a moment that sums it all up, isn't that clever?"" ending. It reads like a list of experiences in one person's life.I had great hopes for this book. The first story intrigued me. After that, there were a few laughs, but nothing else.Save your money, and go out and talk to a perfect stranger over a cup of coffee. You'll learn more about yourself and people as a whole, and maybe have a few funny adventures of your own."
1,"Light, fluffy but not much to take with you","While it was entertaining in parts, this book definitely is not one I would read again. It seems introspective and thoughtful if you care to see things through the eyes of a totally self absorbed person. It saddened me to think this is where evolution is taking us... I could not identify with it."
2,Fizzled Out,"After the first two chapters, I was laughing out loud and congratulating myself on having chosen a really good book. By the middle of the book, the humor was wearing thin and I found myself actually disliking - very much - the main character. By the end of the book, I couldn't stand him, and I wasn't laughing anymore. He struck me as a weak, non-memorable whiner who would rather play the cynic as opposed to trying to make any situation he found himself in better through some initiative of his own. I had no expectations when I bought the book - didn't know what it would be like. But after having read it, I feel as if it was time out of my life wasted. You know how when you finish a good book you feel a real sense of satifaction? Well, with this one I felt only annoyed."
1,Didn't like it,"I was very disappointed with this book. I've enjoyed Sedaris' essays on ""This American Life"" and loved his ""Holidays on Ice"" book, so I was really looking forward to this. It simply wasn't funny. I found it sarcastic, angry and even depressing. It wasn't just self-deprecating, it was mean-spirited.I definitely do not recommend it."
3,"Good, but not funny","This is a good book: well written, entertaining, interesting, insightful, at times poignant. But it's just not funny. Various other reviewers have described this book as ""hilarious,"" ""side-splitting,"" etc. I just didn't find it to be so. Should you buy it? Sure, it's a good read. But if you want funny, read Dave Barry."
3,Amusing,I finished NAKED by David Sadaris and have to say that I am neutral about this book. It was amusing but I had a hard time with all the 'craziness' that he has experienced. Can one person really meet that many odd people in one lifetime? I realize that as a writer and a humorist he was able to take some liberties but this was supposed to be a recounting of his life up until now. Also thru the whole book he talked past tense but the last chapter entitled 'naked' talked in the present tense which I found bothered me because it seemed kind of random although I suppose at the time maybe he was writing it right then. One more thing was the way he skipped around and didn't just follow one pattern from age to age but went to his childhood and then to an adult and then back to teenager etc. It made it kind of hard to follow at times. I would have preferred to listen to this book opposed to reading it. It might be better understood in the authors own voice.
4,Starts strong but fizzles a bit,"Within the first 50 pages I fell in love with the short stories which give us a glimpse into Sedaris' crazy life. He turns the tragic into the hysterical. Case in point, the stories that dealt with his obessive compulsive disorder. Although most describe this book as ""funny,"" not all the stories are as entertaining as the ones based in his child hood. As a whole, the book is an account of Sedaris' life experiences, which is not a total laugh riot. Ultimately, you'll meet some unforgettable people and have a couple of laughs. I would recommend but don't expect to be rolling on the floor laughing the entire time."
2,Fizzled out,"This was my first experience with Sedaris and initially found him to write sarcastic humor extremely well. He is so witty, I tried to commit some of his one-liners to memory. I was intrigued with the first essay and really impressed with the second about his compulsive behaviors. His descriptions of his mother were fantastic! Kinda' Ya-Ya sisterhood, without all the resentment. His self-descriptions were very flat, leaving me with a feeling this is a person I wouldn't want to hang out with ---- which can't be true because he is very funny!Unfortunately, this book fizzled out for me. The hitchihiking stories have been done before. The look at middle America was funny at times, but not insightful. It got slower and slower. I could hardly endure the last chapter and didn't need to hear another description about someone's pimply butt. I just wanted it to end.I recommended reading the first two essays. If the third lets you down, forget it. It doesn't get any better than chapter 2."
2,Somewhat funny...,"Somewhat funny, but not worth nearly the hype these reviews have attributed to this book. If you've read everything else, consider this book. If not, don't waste your time. I won't review the pointless prose of each chapter. It was disjointed and in many cases, it tried to be much funnier than it is. One or two of the stories in this book are worth reading, but it is nothing compared to what some of these reviews claim.When I read, I want one story that will keep me turning the page for 500 pages. This is comprised many stories that make you want to turn the page simply to see if it gets any better. It may be of some interest to light readers who want to read a story in 10-15 minutes. There are plenty in this book to choose from. Otherwise, find something else."
4,THE MOON IS ON MY SIDE,"I love this journal. See Im a journal [fan], I love to write in journals. Moon Gazing is a nice journal it tells you about moon and shows you the different moon shapes on each page. I just love it. Order it people it nice to have and to get as a gift too."
5,the real hip-hop,"I don't normally write reviews.. But this cd is more than worthy of the time. In a time were real hip hop skills seem to be replaced by actors put on by whack labels the GZA is at the top of his game! backed by some fly beats from muggs, and some guest appearances from fellow wu members this cd exceeded all expectations. Don't hesitate to pick this album up."
5,tizzight !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this has got to be the best gza album i've ever heard the beats are bangin and the lyrical outcome is the sh?t. i havent heard gza like this since liquid swords. grab this sh?t immediately or download it.
2,Really bad lyrics,"It sounds good. `All in together now's a really good track.But...GZA's lyrics are on the turn. Someone earlier said that the lyrics of `Queens Gambit' were really good. Well... here's an example:She dated jolly green GIANTS, that, flew on JETSAn A-list actress, who was never walked off setsShe loved stuffed animals, especially BEARSI think they're pretty bad.If you like the lyrics then it's probably worth four stars. But for me they were too rubbish to listen to ..."
1,peeeeng.... pooonggg... peeeeng.... pooonggg... peeeeng.... pooonggg...,"if u dont mind hearing that ""hook"" looped so repetitively, and it does not bother you that there is no variety in the production of any of these songs, then maybe you can find some interesting word play. i cannot get past a really badly produced album, no matter how ill the lyricism is. if you can, you may have a head injury.for the true hip hop heads, check out Danger Doom, Madlib, Living Legends"
5,"BUY THIS ALBUM, NOW!","No words can quite describe the feeling you'll get when you bump the first song of this new CD from GZA, completely produced by DJ Muggs. Remember the GZA/Muggs collabos on Soul Assassins I & II? That sound is back for an entire joint! PERFECT tracklist, no filler, just straight East Coast lyricism with dope beats woven into a consistent ""Chess"" theme. GZA steps up to the plate yet again; his storytelling is vivid, his writing is pared down and raw on this, his 5th Solo album. GZA is obviously the best MC to walk the earth, out-rhyming anything you've heard in the past few years from Canibus, Ghost, RZA, G-Unit or Nas. GZA and Muggs both show their prowess here and they deserve your support. Cop this Wu-banger, you won't be disappointed."
4,It's aight,"Contrary to what everyone's saying, this cd is just okay. Or good. But definitely not great. Of course, lyrically Gza's always going to be a ten out of ten. Amazing lyrics. Great images, storytelling... songs that reference all of the teams in the nfl... But there's so much more to the quality of a rap album than just lyrics. Rarely does Gza change up his flow. Often he sounds kind of bored and dull. Furthermore, the songwriting's not so great. The hooks are generally awful. And the beats are good- but kinda so-so, and very similar to each other. Some of them are very repetitive and get annoying after a while. This cd is nothing compared to Liquid Swords. Everything's just a little... dry. But it's definitely a worthwhile purchase, and is probably the best album, lyrically, of 2005."
5,never lose faith in the Genius,"Once again, lyricism reigns supreme. Feels alot more like Liquid Swords than Legends, in my opinion.After 2 listens thru, my favorite tunes are ""Those That's Bout It"" and ""General Principles.""""All in Together Now"" and ""Unstoppable Threats"" are phat tunes as well.The GZA is definitely the illest member of the clan, hands down."
5,Absolutely the greatest,This CD contributed to many of our ceremonies' success. The best is that is girls singing! I highly recommend it to every leader.
3,Sporatic gut wrenching laughs makes it worth watching.,"At times this movie will have you in tears, and have others reaching for vivarin. A blatent ripp-off of such classics as Kentuckcy Fried Movie and Groove Tube. The thin plot revoles around a man who is tired of the city and decides to move his family to the wilderness. The jokes are stale after ten minutes but, the short commercials and intermission will leave you with stomach cramps."
1,Boring and not even funny,"I enjoy bad movies, the sort of movies that are so bad that they're funny. Movies like Killer Condom, Amazon Women in the Avacado Jungle of Death, Barbarella, and most anything done by MST3K. This movie is not in that realm, it is just plain bad... it lacks the charm and humor of a good campy movie. The premise sounds amusing, but really, don't waste your time with this one."
2,Disappointing,"I must admit I purchased this only to see the lovely Gates McFadden. If you are thinking along the same lines, DO NOT buy this without renting it first. She only appears for about five minutes, albeit in a t-shirt and shorts. I did watch the movie and can say that as a comedy, it makes a good sedative. This idea was better done later with Amazon Women on the Moon"
1,Hampster escapes no matter how much i modify it,"ive tried duct tape on everything, caulking the plastic where the cage contacts it....hampster always finds a way out.....crappy cage."
3,"Okay, but hard to keep clean","I bought this cage at a petsmart because it looked great and very pretty with all the colors. My hamster Goldie loved it and would run around in it. It is spacious. The first time I tried to clean it was bad. Cleaning every little piece, including the long tube and stuff took longer than I would have liked, especially for once a week. Another reviewer said that liquid waste seems to be absorbed by the plastic, and I caught that too. I switched back to her old cage without all the tubes and stuff. This cage is spacious, and fun, but very hard to keep clean. It was okay, but I would not purchase again."
1,Crittertrail 3 is a dangerous cage,"We bought the Crittertrail 3 cage for a hamster that was bored with our usual cages. She enjoyed it quite a bit. However, she fell from the top of the cage to the bottom and injured herself. We put another hamster in the cage at a later time. She also fell from the top to the bottom of the cage. She broke her hip and suffered a lot of pain from it before she passed away the following week as an older hamster. When we took this cage along with us to the vet, she told us that the height was dangerous, a conclusion that we had already suspected. She told hamster should have a fairly low height cage because they do climb and fall. After these two hamster girls were injured we bought the Superpet My First Rat Cage and have used it ever since. It has been an excellent habitat for Syrians, with low enough height as well as larger floor space. We have now had over twenty hamsters over the years, most of whom have enjoyed the Superpet rat cage."
1,HORRIBLE.. Don't waste your $$$,"The Crittertrail Three is a beautiful cage. It is colorful and bright and was a much prettier cage than most we saw at the pet store. HOWEVER.. it is a pain to put together, a pain to keep clean and it literally falls apart after a short period of time. We have had ours for 6 months and are already looking to buy a new one because this one has already broken. Right now I have duck tape holding the top closed so my hamster will not escape.Please, do not waste your money."
1,Critter trail cages,I have had three of these and have had to return all three. They are very poorly made. The pieces of plastic break very easily and I have had my hamsters escape many a time. Do not waste your money on a critter trail cage.
1,Piece of crap.,"Impossible to clean, you remove the top, everything comes apart. My hamsters escaped countless times, found myself having to duct tape parts of the cage they were escaping from. Plastic breaks all over the place, more duct tape. This is a poor excuse for a cage."
2,"I Could Be A Great Game, But This One Isn't Finished","When i bought it, it thought it would be great but...... the wrestlers look great but don't look like the real wrestlers on which they are supposed to look. And where did they get that fake entrance music it is really bad...The wrestlers don't have many moves (it's a pity to say that when you are trying a difficult move, your move will always be reversed by the other wrestler.. it's frustrating)..."
2,Wrestling at its weakest,Don't bother with this game. Get Def Jam Vendetta. It's much better than this game on its worst day.
4,WORST WRESTLING GAME EVER,"This is the worst wrestling game I have ever played. The gameplay [stinks], the wrestlers don't even have their trademark entrance music, and you can only perform just a couple of moves! The graphics are alright, the controls are a little confusing but its easy to pick it up, but the gameplay is just horrible. Each character looks [bad] when they walk and the views are horrible. The sound effects aren't so great either. It's just the same repetitive ""oofs"" and ""ahhs"" and its boring. I recommend that you stay as far away as possible from this game. It's not even worth the money to rent."
4,Tape Copier,I found this product to be very good for recording sermons. The speed was excellent relative to copying time and the playback was clear with a minimum of background noise.
5,"snug, work great","I use these gloves mostly for pull-ups and other hanging exercises. They are snug, but not uncomfortable, and they work great. I bought them especially because they're machine washable."
2,Training Gloves,"I ordered a small, since this is what I have had in the past,although not this brand. They are really tight and very hard for me to get on and off. I guess small is extra small."
5,GREAT book to have!,"This is my 3rd one of these books! I like to use the 'Notes' pages and when they get filled up, I'm ready for a new one.There is nothing like starting or ending the day with a time of reading the Psalms and Proverbs. This book makes it very simple and convenient. And, as I mentioned, the 'notes' page makes it really nice to jot down thoughts after reading.Thanks!"
1,Do Not Buy a Saeco Product,"I agree with the reviewer who says the Odea leaks (mine started day one) and the customer service is non-existent. I purchased my Odea a year ago. I decided I could live with the leaking issue as it brewed a descent cup of java. However when the unit ceased to function altogether, I contacted the customer service email listed in the unit. After a week they responded and told me to contact the warranty vendor (Saeco, it turns out, does not offer any warranty on their product!).I called the number they gave me and got a recording. I left phone number and email contact info. They have not responded.I contacted Saeco again and they said, in essence, tough luck--that's when they told me that they offer no warranty service on the products they sell.Any company that does not warranty its product is a failed company. I will never even consider purchasing another Saeco product and would recommend you do not buy any Saeco machine."
1,Did not work,I pruchased this from another webite. I unpacked it and followed the instructions but the unit did not work. The Illy expresso coffee beans kept getting jammed in the built-in grinder. It seemed very cheap and flimsy. Not something worth the price they are asking for it.
4,Darn (EDIT - BAD) good espresso maker,"I've had my Saeco Odea for several months now. I am still happy I got it. It has been trouble free and easy to maintain. I've been trying all sorts of roasts and beans.There is one feature that I appreciate that I didn't see mentioned anywhere, and that is the fact that the device sits on a swivel. This make is very easy to turn the unit while it sits on the counter so you can easily get to the reservoir or the grounds.My one gripe is I wish they had an external indicator showing the water level of the reservoir. I've wasted beans with a partial brew not realizing there wasn't very much water left.UPDATE (Aug 2009):I have had this for over a year now. During that time it has broken down twice. Both times it started leaking water and the ""boiler tubes"" had to be replaced. The first repair was under warranty, but I wasn't so lucky the 2nd time.Do not buy this machine - save your money. I would give it 1 star, but Amazon isn't allowing me to change it."
5,Best thing I've ever purchased!,"The price point made me apprehensive at first, but let me tell you, this machine has improved my quality of life 10 fold. I am probably the most miserly SOB you will ever meet, and yikes, the price is steep, but you will actually be saving a ton of money because the espresso this machine is able to make is much better than Starbucks. And I am NOT a morning person, but I actually look forward to getting up in the morning now because I know with a double tap of the button I will have a delicious fresh double espresso waiting for me. I don't usually write reviews, but I want others to experience the happiness this product has given my wife and I - and by doing so, hopefully it will make the world a better place. Enjoy."
2,Tech Support Is Non-Existant,"It took three days for them to answer my first email with ""what version of windows are you running?"" as a response. I emediatly sent back a response and 3 days later I still haven't heard back from them. The product will not rip from cd's in 'normal' mode, only 'fast' mode which makes the music sound like garbage."
1,On Golden Pond(Import),"This is the worst CD I have ever listened to. I thought it was the soundtrack from ""On Golden Pond"",(the movie). After being irate that it wasn't, my husband & I laughed hysterically as each track sounder like a wildlife refuge. The major sound on each track sounded like someone with their hand in a bucket of water making swooshing sounds, accompanied by a frog doing the ribit thing. Absolutely terrible.Aone star rating is way too high for this one!"
4,Cosmic Chicken Soup for the Working Woman's Soul,"Listening to this audiobook in my car driving kids to and from lessons and on my i-pod commuting to and from work was as comforting as a one-hour full body massage. Although much of what she discusses would be familiar to anyone who has dabbled in New Age, the way that Dr. Borysenko frames this information specifically in terms of the anguishes and rewards of a working woman's life made it uniquely digestible and gave me much food for thought."
2,Blah,"Feel good crap book. Not inspirational, informative, or even good. Her sob story about being busy. Maybe if you loved your man more then he would't have left and your kids wouldn't be stuck in day care."
2,Not As Handy As One Might Hope,"This container was purchased for hand-toting holiday cookies half-way across the country by air. The odd shape was nice for fitting into a larger bag, and the double-high approach with an insert shelf was ok, too. Unfortunately, the shelf is not the same size as the footprint, leaving a couple inches off of both ends. To prevent cookies from falling through, it was necessary to cut a piece of posterboard to sit on top. The handle was a bit counterintuitive (should have looked at the picture first;), and, even when fitted properly, still was not complete secure. The lid seems flimsy and does not seal very well.Though it served our needs adequately this holiday season, and is somewhat unique in its design, I can only somewhat recommend it as a solution. I found rectangular containers from another major brand that, though not as tall and lacking the interior shelf, worked just as well with a better seal and 2 for about half the price of this one container."
2,yeah right,"this movie is incredibly boring with long scenes that you are supposed to be building intrigue but instead put you to sleep. the previous reviews are what I based my purchase on and thanks for nothing people. I only suffered through the whole movie because I thought it had to get better, but no it does not it just stays boring. If you decide to take the other people opinions and buy this movie, then you think it sucks and is extremely boring half way through, take my advice and don't even finish it. Also take into account how long my review is compared to theirs. The whole movie is kind of like an uneventful boring soap opera. (...)"
2,overrated movie of bellucci,"this is one of the average movie that i have seen of monica bellucci, there nothing much to rate this i every department be it cinematography, direction, or acting."
4,"lovely sounds, doesn't roll","The toy itself is lovely. Nice chimey sound, gentle but playful. It will be good to give our little guy practice holding a toy with one hand and spinning the interior ball with the other. I would have prefered if the whole thing rolled plus spun to make it a toy to crawl after."
4,"Bamboo Science, Philosophy, Opinion and Lore","When I first read ""The Book of Bamboo"" many years ago, I thought it was brilliantly researched but simply too eccentric in organization and style to be representative of mainstream thought on the subject. Despite the wealth of information it contains, I hesitated to recommend it to people for fear its intensity would put people off rather than draw them in. However, after several years of growing bamboo in coastal northern California, I recently picked it up again and instantly recognized it for the classic it is. Fewer than 1 percent of 1 percent of all non-fiction books published are ever republished after they go out of print, especially by a prestigious national firm with major editorial capabilities. See for yourself why David Farrelly's ""The Book of Bamboo"" is one of those rare, wonderful books worthy of such investment and respect."
4,"Great book -- eclectic, poetic, and practical","this book is a encyclopedic idea book, full of plant descriptions, botanical characteristics including harvesting and propagating, and scores of ideas on how to use bamboo. Demanding and educational; useful and inspiring --- even if you don't buy the book, grow bamboo . . . Mark Wall"
3,Listen don't read,"This muddled rip-off of Wuthering Heights would be a must-miss were it not for the audiobook narrator Lorna Raver's superb, nuanced reading. She gives us vivid characterization where the author gives none, and excels at mood and atmosphere. A beautiful voice beautifully employed on an unworthy project."
2,"If Must Read It, Take It to the Beach","The time I spent plodding through this book was not time well spent, so I'm not going to waste much more on this review. Although publicized as a serious read, this book reminds me of a Harlequin romance, just longer and with bigger words and without protagonist names such as Lance or Crystal, although Bruder, the spurned lover, comes close. This is the type of book you find on the shelves of a rented beach house, next to the sections devoted to Danielle Steel and Anne Rivers Siddons: the same misunderstandings, contrived plots, and improbable coincidences. If you must read it, save it for the beach or a long plane trip."
3,Mixed,"Although this novel is meticulously researched and presents an unscathing (and very honest) depiction of Pasadena old society, the love story dominates rather than any real history of Pasadena. And I feel its necessary somewhere to acknowledge Emily Bronte for said love story. Pasadena is Wuthering Heights, but in Southern California at the beginning of the twentieth century. And that being mentioned nowhere, not even in any of the reviews I have read, it took me by surprise. However, I read it in one day, could not put it down. It just didn't live up to my expectations as historical fiction."
2,Wuthering Heights warmed over,"I've read Wuthering Heights and in comparison with this book, Wuthering Heights captures the story's tragic loves much better. Pasadena is Wuthering Heights dressed in an orange grove and onion farm. I was disappointed that the story is not only using Bronte's storyline, but it doesn't have the force of Bronte's. Ebershoff explains Linda's and Bruder's reasonings for their mistakes, but Bronte gave a more magical and spooky tale. If you are interested in California history, there are other books, and if you are interested in a tragic love story, check out Wuthering Heights."
3,Good CD for those long drives,"I heard about this cd from a friend. They were telling me about the track Maxwell layed down for this compilation. After buying it I realized that this CD has a lot of international flava that I liked alot. Sting, Omar, George Micheal, and Crystal Waters are some of the artist featured on this CD. The track by Maxwell (Seguranca) is the best track I've heard from him. It is some songs I can't vibe off of but over all the CD was a good buy.oNe"
4,Better the 2nd time around,"I'm a big Brazilian music fan but I generally prefer the classic brazilian sounds with a new twist of electronic or funk fusion. This CD does that for me. The first time I listened, I was disappointed but since then it has grown on me with the exception of the PM Dawn, Sting, Maxwell and the George Michael tracks, mainly because that's not my style. Brazilian music purists will probably not enjoy this CD but if you like the brazilain twist sprinkled on your other musical genres, you'll probably enjoy this. Just look at the list of contributing artists: Everything But The Girl, Cesaria Evora and Caetano Veloso with Ryuichi Sakamoto, David Byrne & Marisa Monte, Gilberto Gil, Money Mark, Crystal Waters, Mad Professor, Chico Science & Nacao Zumbi with DJ Soul Slinger, Stereolab and Herbie Mann, Milton Nascimento, Bebel Gilberto... This ""Brazilian music"" is different, but cool."
5,This Is Pure Listening Pleasure...,"RED HOT + RIO is by far one of the best compilations out there. The album is an eclectic mix of Brazillian-influenced music (Samba, Porteguese, African, and Indigenous beats, ryhthms, and melodies). It doesn't matter if you don't know Porteguese, you'll find yourself humming a long, perhaps even dancing to the provocative and beautiful songs. I must have listened to this album through hundreds of times...it's perfect for long drives or as background music for dinner parties. The duets on this album are particularly strong; Astrud Gilberto and George Michael's duet and David Bryne and Marisa Monte's duet are very inspiring, sensuous, and beautiful. Overall, though, this album is a must have for anyone's collection. You'll certainly keep pressing repeat on this album."
5,Ideal music for relaxation and entertaining!,I love every song on this CD and it has led me to purchase many other Brazilian artists CD's. It is a great introduction to Samba and great remakes of some Brazilian artists. I recommend it as a great starter for anyone interested in Samba/Jazz.
1,Bad Brazilian,"I have collected Brazilian music for thirty six years.This CD was poorly conceived and as a benefit to fight AIDS didn't help the cause much. The sound was mostly electronically enhanced and didn't resemble the beautiful Brazilian music I have loved and enjoyed for 2/3rds of my life. Even though I recognized many of the artists on this CD,this definately wasn't thier finest hour. I'm sure this CD will never see the inside of our CD player again."
1,Better Versions Available,"This book has a slangy style that violates the spirit of Native American storytelling. The author ""borrows"" from the Cherokees but gives no source notes. There are better versions of this myth available."
2,VERY ODD MOVIE,"This movie is very odd. It can't seem to decide what it is: ( a take off on Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW, with elements from several other movie-types thrown in?). You can see the potential (especially with the two leads) but it is all so confused and disjointed and, well, pointless. Obviously below low budget."
5,From the crew that's got the Fire.,"Samson of SamsonsTouch is an amazing musician and performer. This cd is awesome. I saw him live in Providence, RI, and it blew me away. Incredibly impressive."
5,Urban Fantasy at its absolute grandest!!!,"Dreams Underfoot is the first book I ever read by Charles De Lint, and he became my favorite author half way through the text. Although I have read every other De Lint book or story I can find, and they are all simply breathtaking, (check out Memory and Dream!!) Dreams Underfoot has remained my favorite. Sentimentality, no doubt. Dreams Underfoot is a tapestry novel, with characters and events that weave themselves together to give you a fabulous picture of the city of Newford and all its strange and wonderful aspects. De Lint's writing style is brilliant, both lyrical and funny, both sad and strange. If you like Fantasy novels, in particular Urban Fantasy, then do not, under any circumstances, miss this book. De Lint is considered one of the seminal authors of the Urban Fantasy genre, and there is no doubt in my mind that he is a master of his craft."
5,Exquisite and poignant urban fantasy,"Skillfully interweaving magic, music, art, compassion, and contemporary issues such as child abuse and homelessness, Charles DeLint is hardly an escapist. However, in this anthology he offers glimpses of a well-realized world much like our own, just different enough to allow faerie to wander city streets barefoot in winter, or for a practical joke involving a gorilla suit to lead to a fleeting encounter with a genuine yeti. My favorite story in the collection is a gorgeous, heartbreaking retelling of 'The Little Mermaid'."
5,Realistic and Scary as Hell,"As I read this novel, it got worse and worse until I thought it could not get any worse, and then it really got worse. A week later, I could still vividly remember the characters and could envision them in a motion picture. I could not put it down once I started reading. There has to be a lot of truism in this novel and very thought provoking."
5,Great Book!,This book was GREAT! I read it before September 11th. It was amazing how true to life this book was. It was somewhat scary.The Shadow Government was well written by someone with obvious experience in regards to emergency situations that could arise in the U.S. or any other part of the world for that matter.This is a MUST read book!
1,Shockingly off color,"I assume I received a defective batch of dye; others have been enthusiastic about the product. I was testing it to bring sap wood to more nearly match the heartwood in the same boards, intending to build walnut cabinets for a new kitchen. the medium brown walnut product produced a very orange color."
3,"Not ""The Makeup"" Eyelash Curler","Purchased this from Emma's Cosmetics & Skincare (Amazon seller) since it looked the same as the one I bought at Sephora. This is actually the Shiseido 213 Eyelash Curler, imported from Japan, not ""The Makeup"" model.Although it works fine, the build and finish quality is not the same as ""The Makeup""It's probably better if I bought from Sephora again."
2,BOOTLEG???,"Does it's job, but it came in a package not even in English. Plus, the pads did not have the authentic Shiseido logo, which leads me to believe it was a bootleg version. No where near the performance of the compared shu uemura like it was supposed to be, but it works ok, no pinches at least. Was disappointed."
2,Not as Advertised,The item I received was inferior and completely overpriced. I returned it immediately. Not even close to what was pictured. This is my first big disappointment with anything from Amazon.
2,What's the big deal?,"I don't know why this curler is considered better than the 1/2 or 1/3-priced other name-brand curlers. I read reviews that it created a more natural curl and that it lasted longer. Not for me! I've been curling my eyelashes for many, many years now, and this one doesn't impress me. Its only benefit that I see is that its curve is shallower than some other brands, which makes if fit more comfortably over almond-shaped eyes. I'd save your money and buy rubber replacements with it for your current curler-- I think those are really the key to a decent curl and not losing eyelashes while curling."
3,Grandson's Gift,I can only say that it arrived as promised. Have not heard back from the family on the Ollie game.Computer made me select a rating
2,confusing for 3-5 years old,"For a 3-5 years old (what is recommended), it is very confusingand boring. There is little help, and not enough animation andfun games to play."
3,Mind-numbing,"The good:Fantastic design, perfect graphics even on 1600x1200 screen where other kids softwares shows only a small window. This one is full screen and great image quality. Also very good music and voice quality. The game generates surprises when you search for things. The characters ask you for things you need to search to help them. So far so good.The bad:After playing the game (helping my son) for about 2 hours from beginning to end, my mind was numb and I was nervous.The suggetion:Instead of buying computer games for you kids, just go in the garden with them and let them help you water the plants and such things. Works with my kid, gives him exercise too."
3,An OK game for a 5 year old,"Although this is an OK game for a 5 year old, we definitely preferred 'Little Bill Thinks Big' - that got a lot of use!"
3,Ollo,"Ok the colors are nice, but you play this once and your done. The game does not change no levels nothing. I bought it because of the great reviews, but this game is not worth the money and I bought it on discount! A great fun game is reader rabbit preschool my 3 year old loves it and always asks for the rabbit game :)"
2,Too Basic to Recommend for Anyone,"The words in this dictionary are limited to what you might encounter in a freshman introductory course. So why don't you just look in the glossary of your textbook? As it is, I can't think of any category of student who would benefit from having it."
2,Monotonous,"Very uninteresting. Recording is focused on the drive train of the engine, with a few whistle sounds thrown in for good measure. It needs more diversity, should have included rolling stock sounds like the clack of the wheels over the rails and the squeaks of the couplers. All the other sounds of a train are over-shadowed by the engine."
2,It's really not that good.,"Where should I start...don't get this album! It is a waste of money (even for $8) because there's only about 22 minutes of play on it. Potshot's first album at least has about 32 minutes (more for your money, obviously). Also, the songs on the first one are far more memorable."
3,The cats have hands instead of paws,"I have the 2011 version of this calender and have enjoyed the bright images and amusing captions. So I was somewhat dissappointed to see the 2012 version features what is better described as human bodies with cat heads. The hands and feet are human, not feline as in the 2011 version-this is completely distracting and out of place. I hope the 2013 version (if there is one) returns to paws."
4,love these calendars but...,"I have the 2011 calendar and I loved it, so I put this one on my wishlist. I got it for Christmas and it's great as well (I didn't realize it was Zodiac themed, but it's ok). I kind of miss the little stories it had with each picture, though. The 2011 calendar had longer captions to accompany each picture and the 2012 calendar has zodiac descriptions. I also am weirded out that the cats have human hands instead of paws. I don't like that aspect either.Otherwise, though, the art is great and the calendar is amusing for someone who is crazy about cats or someone who just likes whimsical artwork. :)"
1,Unfortunately contains very little music from the film,"The wonderful, beautiful, and classical theme music that served as the introduction to this film - is *not* included on this CD. It contains nothing but remixes; drunken karaoke being sold as opera with all the charm and wonder of the real film music surgically removed. No stars."
4,Cobalt and vodka,Beam's departure from homespun solo mellowness into something fuller and more uptempo-without loosing much intimately melodic energy- was beginning to take hold with a tight transitional short-length.
5,Like a Steady Breeze,"Sam Beam has a great EP here. His contemporary folk music is original and intense despite the soft guitars and rhythms. Backing female vocals make the songs that much more haunting. Both relaxing and challenging at the same time, Woman King is a distinctive and important piece of work well worth multiple listens."
2,These guys need more whisky and gasoline in their water.,"A cool lady I call the Rockchick loaned me this ep; I listened.Man, o, man, this stuff could put trees to sleep. I told the Rockchick that it sounded like these guys were serenading angels and not people that live on earth. If you're 15-19 and still have all your hopes and dreams about meeting mr. or ms.right-- get this syrupy ep. Otherwise, listen to Kasabian or the Dandy Warhols...music that rocks even as it moves all over the place spilling cheer and sonic radiation."
5,Few and Far Between,"I have known the Iron & Wine name and sound for some time now, but this was my official introduction. This is one of those few and far between titles, like Bright Eyes ""I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning"" that actually lives up to the hype. Damn good music."
2,Women King,"I wasn't pleased with this CD. I ripped it to my Music library, then synced o my ipod. I have been listening to bothCD's I have ordered and I am not thrilled. Sorry!"
3,DENNIS THE MENACE,"Dennis Hopper must have his name on producers lists for roles that require sadistic, unbridled menace. In HELD FOR RANSOM, he plays a kidnapper with little scruples and a maniacal laugh, and he does well in it. Debi Mazur as his hick wife is very good as well. Hopper murders a bus driver and then hijacks a bus so he can get five rich kids and hold them for ransom. Zachery Ty Bryan, Danny Spelling head the cast of kids and we get Morgan Fairchild, Timothy Bottoms, John Getz and Joan van Ark as the worried parents. There is an unexpected twist at the end you may not see coming, and overall, HELD FOR RANSOM is an okay film."
4,Jazz Age Jane Austen,"...In ""Good Behavior"", Keane has captured this world, depicting with sharply witty and bitter accuracy the passe rituals, the claims of class superiority, the tyranny of families disguised under the label of love. Yet she maintains the poignancy of the human need for acceptance and love.I am looking forward to reading her other novels. And I've heard that there is a BBC production of ""Good Behavior"", so I'll be watching for it as well."
4,keen on keane,"This is the first novel by Molly Keane that I have ever read, but it will not, assuredly, be my last. Keane writes with a bitter irony about the mores of a crumbling Angle-Irish family in the mid-decades of the 20th Century whose behavior is anything but good. Keane has been compared to Jane Austen but she is more biting and less forgiving of her characters' foibles (at least on the evidence in this book)."
3,I felt it was a review of some of the literature we have read before.,"The characters were appealing. However, it was to me a book written as so many are on the lives of the wealthy."
4,Good Behavior,"Delightful story of an eccentric Irish upper class family. Very literate and the novel has several memorable characters, especially the father and mother, and the narrator. The book is so offbeat, I hesitate to recommend it to many people, unless they have a taste for the unusual. ""Good Behavior"" is definitely not a book for the masses."
1,Did not like it at all; although many of my friends did.,"Boring, boring, and more boring (if that can be said). I kept waiting for something to happen. The main character was weak, nothing inspired her. She was always looked upon as being fat and ugly with no brain. Very demeaning to women. Would not recommend it to anyone who really enjoys reading."
1,"Why Keep making ""satellites"" when they all end up having manufacturing defects?","I bought a Satellite in Sept. 2005 and two months later, returned it to Best Buy because it wouldn't connect to the Internet for no apparent reason. They immediately took it away and gave me a new model because of a ""manufacturing defect that had been ""fixed"" with the new model ... then CANCELLED the $150 rebate that was adsvertised with the first defective model! I protested vigorously, but was rudely informed that since I was getting a ""new laptop,"" I was no longer entitled to the rebate! Go figure that one!! I'll never buy another Toshiba."
4,The toshiba satelite 3005 /WI-FI is a very nice linux box!,"I have recently accuired a toshiba 3005 and i was and am still shocked of the options and little things toshiba have put in to the 3005 satellite.Mine has the firewire,removable DVD/CDR which is x8 speed write mode,Smartmedia reader,s-video out for the real tech junkies,3USB ports dual monitor capibilities,WI-FI(802.11B)ethernet and all the little buttons that i will probably never use.I am a LINUX user and i have had very few problems with anything.The sound card could of been a little higher class but i broke mine so i'm looking into something more high performance and better sound quality.I don't have much more to write other than i am very pleased i purcased this laptop. thanx for reading my review"
3,No instructions included,"Received the lock , but there were no instructions inside to tell how to change the lock code. I can't find anywhere online to give instructions either. Any help would be great. That said, the lock is ok. We used it just with the provided factory lock code, but the cord does not retract very well. You have to mess with it to get it back in."
1,Frustrating little lock,"I gave this lock two chances. The first order was obviously an already-opened package, so I returned it. The second one turned out to also be a used lock, since the factory default combination of 0-0-0 did not work. I called their customer support and they recommended returning it. Sorry, won't give it a third try.The instructions are inconveniently written on the inside layer of the cardboard packaging itself, which you have to tear apart to access. The instructions themselves are vague and inaccurate.I opted instead to try another brand. I went with the Kryptonite 998600."
4,great product,"the fastest way to get a great lather. awesome for time crunch. The product itself is practically perfect. If there was a small cover, or something to create a container, it'd get 5 stars. I'd love to be able to throw it in my shave kit for travel."
3,Unable to get a good lather/foam from this product,I really wanted to like this product. The size is great for travel. The smell is nice.I cannot get a good lather from it unfortunately.
2,Not What I Ordered..,"The case I received is not the one pictured here, although it is the same product name and number. The case I received is a single piece, clear plastic cover. It does not have a flip over piece, as is shown here. It's very difficult to use as the buttons are inacessible through the plastic, meaning you have to take it out each time to use it.The vendor should show the actual item, not a completely different one."
5,Just another Luanne Rice classic!!!,"I don't usually run out and buy a hardcover book immediately, but Luanne Rice books make me go and do just that. This book was well written and very touching. The whole premise of the story is Jane comes home to help her sister take care of her mother, but we find out she has come home for a very different reason and that is to find her daughter. As with any Luanne Rice book, Rice never puts all her cards on the table at once. She very slowly reveals her intentions for the charactors development chapter by chapter. The magical web she weaves makes us long to read more to understand and to develop the character in our mind. I spent a night reading this, I just couldn't put it down. Luanne Rice is in fine form. Anyone who enjoys books with a coastal flair will always enjoy Rice's books."
2,Could have been better,"You could probably cut this book in half and it would be a better read. Rice spoonfeeds us the plot, she overdescribes, and she throws in sappy red herrings. If she had built up Jane's betrayal without telling us everything about it, then revealed it to us at the same time Dylan found out, it would have been more compelling (though we may have suspected where she was going). The resolution was much too flat - I didn't see how the characters got to a place of forgiveness for a betrayal that to me would have been unforgivable. I really wish I could have edited the manuscript for her.My biggest objection to the book is the way adoption is portrayed. The bio-mom is constantly referred to as ""real"" while relationships with the adoptive parents (who some would argue ARE the real parents) are trivialized.I give it two stars because I kept reading, even though I wasn't enjoying it."
1,Disappointing,"I found this book very disappointing. Everything was so predictable, I didn't even have to read to the end. Jane was an extremely selfish, self-centered, 35 year old woman. She came home on the pretext of taking care of her mother, yet, that's not why she really came home. She came home to butt into the life of a daughter she gave up at birth and to get into that daughter's uncle's pants. Jane has a younger sister, who has stayed with their mother all these years, pretty much giving up a social life, and her career. Jane supposedly came home to help her, but all she did was leave the sister with more work, and even took her car whenever she wanted without asking. What a selfish character. Anyway, as stated above, the whole story was very contrived and very predictable. What a disappointment. I've read four or five other books by Luanne Rice which I enjoyed very much, but not this one."
4,A good read!,"The main thrust of this story deals with a mother being forced to give up her child for adoption. ""Identity is key"" Jane says. ""Even for birds.""Romance takes a secondary place to the themes of hurt and pain in this story. Jane and Sylvie were deeply hurt when their father walked out on his family.Also in the background is the role of nursing homes where even a school principal or a banker or a stock broker can find themselves. But it is still possible to go to a barn dance and have some fun!The name of this book was very well suited as in the last lines of the story the protagnist holds out her arms to her lover as music begins down below. ""Dance with me"" her eyes seem to say. A touching conclusion."
4,"Touching Story,",Dance with Me by Luanne Rice held my attention throughout the whole story. I enjoyed this writer's characters and the dialogue kept me flipping the pages. Nice Job!
5,Powerful,"This book demonstrates just how well magazine nonfiction can be. The journalists selected are not particuarly well-known, but they are masters of their craft and present highly enjoyable reads. Susan Orlean might be the best-known of the bunch, just because her most recent book, ""The Orchid Thief,"" was highlighted in the 2002 movie ""Adaptation.""For starters, Orlean's piece ""The American Male at Age 10"" was a fascinating look at today's youth. Each piece is outstanding in its own way, but may I also present as standouts ""TV Without Guilt"" (a family whose television is on approximately 16 hours a day) and ""The Man Who Couldn't Read"" (profile of an illiterate millionaire with two college degrees).As a bonus for those with an interest in feature writing, ""Author's Afterwords"" has the writers briefly describe the process of finding and executing their ideas. But if you are an aspiring writer or just appreciative of quality writing, this book is a must-read."
5,"Great product,",Not too sweet and doesn't upset your stomach. Product shipped and arrived very quickly.
2,Strangely different from Japan,"In Japan, Amino Vital Pro is about three times as expensive, so I got this from the USA. The ingredients are stated as the same, yet the flavour is completely different. Furthermore, the Japanese one really seems to have an effect when I work out, whereas this one does not. It might have some electrolytic effect, but it seems to be a different product despite the recipe being the same."
5,The Best Extreme Sports Game Ever,This game is so awesome it's hard to describe it in words. With the huge levels great gameplay and insane soundtrack it is a must buy for anyone who has played any extreme sports game to date. I bought as soon as it came out and haven't taken it out of my PS2 yet. I was hoping someone would come out with an inline skating game and finally ACCLAIM has done so. Well I have to get back to playing Aggressive Inline hopefully you buy it and see what i mean.
4,Aggressive Inline is a great game,"When I first got Aggressive Inline I thought it would be another game where you play it for a few weeks then it never gets touched again - IT'S NOT!!! When I started playing the game I noticed that the levels are HUGE!! Then, I figured out that you could do extreme tricks like skitch onto cars and do vaults and flips. You can also unlock extra levels in the main level. Another thing is you have a juice meter and when that runs out (when you fall down too much or just don't do enough tricks)that level ends. This may sound good, but after a while I would get tired of the level and quit.I though this game was really fun so I give it 4 stars"
1,Order cancelled by seller,"I ordered a product and the next thing I know, my order was cancelled by Wizards Chest, without any explanation. I kind of needed this for a Halloween Party I'm hosting. Guess I'll make sure I don't order anything from the Wizards Chest again."
3,Fun,"I bought this book when I travelled Burma/Myanmar this spring. As I got back home I had photo-sessions with some privileged friends who were served burmese food (to keep them quiet throughout the 3h-speech on my travel, culture and politics). The food I served was prepared according to these receipts (and spiced up with what I remembered from the trip), and it turned out to bee very close to what I had tasted.Since I bought a blackmarket-copy in Myanmar I'm not sure whether I speak for all editions, but I fear that there's never pictures to meals - but then there's drawings of burmese people and hints on how to entertain your guests.Overall, it's a good book with good receipts and useful information, without pictures. And sometimes the book lack tips for substitutes on hard-to get ingredients."
5,Awesome stand for the price...,"You can't ask for much more from a TV stand; this one is sturdy, elegant, affordable and easy to assemble. I've loved the look of all the Z-Line products that I've ever seen, whether in person or online. And with the recent purchase of a new TV it gave me the perfect oportunity to purchase something by Z-Line. Trust me if Z-Line makes it's something you'll like. They may not have much for advertising but their products speak for themselves."
5,Lovely stand,"Nice looking, sturdy. Roomy, holds our 34-in TV, dish network box, dvd and music stuff with a couple of speakers. Very useful overall. The v-shaped base now holds the homebase of my Roomba vacuum for easy docking and charging. The stand was easy and quick to assemble - was a few months pregnant when I did, with some help to hold parts still."
4,Ultimate Ride Coaster Deluxe,"This is a Disney's version of ""Roller Coaster Tycoon"". The graphics are not as good as RCT but this is still a very good game. The background music is very Disney-like and sounds like it was recorded at one of Disney's theme parks. Most of the Disney Interactive games are good and this is no exception.Although it does not say it, this game will work with Windows XP Home Edition."
5,This is going to be AWESOME!,If you have been watching the official site for the game... you know that Hopbell and his crew are putting together an amazing new version of the already classic Ultimate Ride game. You simply must have this game! It's the coolest coaster game ever and you cannot call yourself a coaster fan without it! 'Nuff said?
2,Avoid if you're a RollerCoaster Tycoon fan,"All you do in this game is build rollercoasters! There are no money to make or customers to ride your coaster that you've worked so hard to build. I was fooled at the time I bought this game by the pics with the ferris wheel, concession shops, and themepark stuff in the background; I thought it was a tycoon/sim game. The game calls these nonfunctioning buildings ""props.""The good thing about the game is the detail they put into the coasters like banking curves, vert. and lat. G's, and speed. The flaws I've seen is that you have to go 70 mph to go thru a simple vertical loop. Now that's crazy. Also, the graphics are good, and the ride-your-own-coaster is descent..."
5,"Breathtaking, to say the least !!!","I was never really a fan of Nada Surf before. I found their hit song ""Popular"" from the HIGH/LOW album to be, well...unpopular. A friend of mine asked me to listen to LET GO and after a few spins I really got it. This is an important recording. It injects new life into the pop/rock genre by keeping things simple. I've set the track ""Neither Heaven Nor Space"" on repeat many, many times. ""Hi-Speed Soul,"" ""Fruit Fly,"" ""Inside Of Love"" and ""Happy Kid"" are infectous little gems as well. Don't waste any time. This is a must-have!"
4,lazy afternoon music,"This album is like a great milkshake. Its smooth. great vocals and gorgeous hooks come in every track. Its cool. the perfect blend of crooning and rhythmic guitar(acoustic and electric). Its good all the way through. You wont be disappointed by a single track. The perfect combination of foot tapping and mind wandering. Good music to get ""spacier than an astrounaut"" to.essential tracks - blizzard of 77', inside of love, killian's red, treading water, paper boats"
5,There is hope yet...,"With all the crappy uninspired teenage relationship simple plan garbage that continues to brainwash our youth today, there is hope yet. Nada Surf is simply put one of the greatest and soulful bands in the underground scene. They deserve success, they can upstage all the ""bands"" that are overplayed on the embarrassing MTV network. Give this album a chance and see for yourself what I mean when I say there is hope yet..."
4,a must buy,this album is one of nadas best... sound is sacraficed for pure lyrical genius. such a penchant for a song nada surf makes you feel like the songs are being sang directly to you.. killians red is a great song my personal favriote. the album shows a different show far more mellow the prox effect which is a tad better id say.. but this trio pulls it off again great band even better live. slick lyrics spread with great backing music.
3,"Some heartbreakingly beautiful songs among the ""rock""","3 1/2 starsI am a huge fan of the more romtantic(or lack thereof) tunes on this album...While there is a nice variety to the pop rock pallete, Nada Surf excel best when they deal with heartbreak and existential crisis, as exemplified by some of the album's best tracks..Underneath the safe time signatures lies advanced songwriting skills displayed in subtle touches of instrumental emoting..Overall not a masterwork but a definite worthwhile addition for the many haunting songs for you to Let Go to.."
5,"""Let Go"" of Your Shekels and Buy This CD","I'm a latecomer to Nada Surf, and now I rue the lost time I could have spent replaying the songs of this excellent cd. LET GO is funny, plaintive, poignant, but not syrupy. Just when the material seems a bit melancholy, the next song is confident and upbeat.In other words, LET GO has got that perfect balance of musicianship, tunefulness, and structure that a pop music lover digs. I don't have a lot more to say about this band. Why waste time praising (near) perfection?SIDELIGHT: The iTunes genre this falls under is ""Alternative and Punk."" Not. This seems like the default genre selected for contemporary rock/pop bands."
2,Disappointing,"This album is a total disappointment. I heard many good things about this album from fans of Weezer and just critics altogether. I really don't get a lot of people are raving about this album. Although there is nothing significantly wrong with this album the songs just sound boring and repetitive. It is like listening to the same mellow, surf song ten times over. The only song I enjoyed was Killian's Red but the rest of the album you could easily toss away. Basically this album is just boring ... Now I have heard songs from previous Nada Surf albums and if they could have captured their energy of old then they might have come out with a album worth listening to. But until then stay tuned..."
2,mediocrity personified,"I got this album after hearing Nada Surf's single, Popular. I liked that because of the humorous approach it took to high school and the heavy edge it had to it. That is gone in this album. Instead the band has adopted a softer side. They all sing (in harmony!) and their voices are nothing special at all. Instrumentally, they sound exactly like all the other pop-rock bands out there. They could be some other group, and you would never know.Their lyrics are [bad]. I had to keep myself from laughing out loud at the stupidity of the lyrics in various songs. (Fruit Fly is the worst.)Baisically, there is no quality in this music to distinguish it from anything else. Buy it if you want an entertaining 30 minutes - throw it away afterwords, because you'll never listen to it again."
2,Boring,"Slow moving, boring and dated. Much of the footage is from the 80th anniversary.Instead of showing us gobs of people (in their 1980's attire) standing there looking at museum/display items, perhaps we could have seen some of the items."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS,"Ordered this movie in hopes of having an interesting documentary with actual pics of Titanic, etc. This is CRAP. Fake pics, and just a bunch of people talking in the background. This movie is a bore fest, plz don't waste your money!"
2,A Zero,With embarrassingly bad acting It is beyond me why this movie gleaned so much attention by Oprah and others on the talk show circuit
2,Not that great of a DVD,"I bought this DVD and after watching about 1 hour, was very disappointed. First the picture quality is not good at all. I was expecting an HD quality DVD but it is really not. Second, it bored me a lot. I was also expecting real footage of the Titanic but so far none of that. They just filmed old pictures and talked about them. So not interesting. I had to stop the DVD because I couldn't find anything interesting. Very very disappointed :("
4,The Unsinkable Review,"Very informative documentary on the Titanic. Nice length at 4 hrs and 28 minutes! Most other Titanic documentaries clock in at 90 minutes max. I wish the producers would have spent a few extra bucks and close captioned the DVDs. Sometimes it's hard to understand what's being said. Other than this glaring omission, I'd definitely recommend this to a Titanic collector."
2,Shoulders too big,"I bought this hoping it would be a great find becasue the price was so low, but it has an awkward cut to it. The material is of good quality, but the shoulders are so broad and the waste is very small. I still wear it, but it always feels a little awkward."
5,Great gift for high schooler,"Bought his for a science-minded ninth grader. Great color and is laminated, included bio of scientists on chart. Appropriate size for bedroom wall. Took a week for USPS to deliver."
5,Incredible,"I was looking for books about Jeane Dixon because my Dad had mentioned reading her books in the 1960's. Because of all the political turmoil in the last years, i was curious. I couldnt find anything on her in the public library, so here I am. I truely believe she was gifted by God. She was very genuine and such a devout Catholic and religious person. She took no money for her readings and prophecies, except for her charity to underpriveledged children. I researched a lot of the prophecies she made and the revelations (which cant be changed) and found the accuracy astounding. Anyway, read for yourself, you wont be disappointed."
3,Much smaller than I expected...,"I originally bought the charm for myself because I whale watch often and a friend adopted a female whale for me named 'Eden.' I am gently obsessed with doingwhat I can to ensure the survival of the whales - especially Humpbacks. I did love the way the baby whale was suspended from its Mother on the charm,but it was more appropriate for my 5 year old Granddaughter to wear. She also loves whales and her Mother 'adopted' a female for her as well, who also has a baby calf! I would have been willing to spend more money for a larger charm, but you tried very hard to create life like detail, and I was very impressed with your service. SOMEWHERE on the internet there is a LARGE Humpback whale medallion, shown with 2 others, and I have been unable to find it again. Can you help me???"
4,RTS is the best game,I beat all of the army men games but this one I waiting to beat this game I would give this a never ending score!
5,Outstanding...,Great game. The only army men game where you have to control and build your own base. I picked up the demo on 3do.com and now I am planning to purchase it. I strongly recomend it.
3,It came as requested...,"It came as requested; however, it does not work on my old, big system but hopefully it will work on my brother's newer slimmer system. I hope so; it is a Christmas gift for him."
1,as far I know this show has never been released offically,the reason for the poor video quality of this dvd is because this is a BOOTLEG. I own a copy and as far as i know it has never been released offically.
1,Poor Video Quiality,"This DVD has very poor video quality, No in Wide Screen but in 4:3Sound also terrible not what I expectedPrice ok, shipping was fast.."
1,Horrible Quality,"Absolutely Horrible quality. This is an older copy of a film done back in the nineties, but if I recall.... videotaping gear was just as good then as it is now. No excuse for such poor quality material on Amazon. The only reason I didn't return the item for a refund, is that there isn't anything else out there for this series of great concerts by Page and Plant."
4,led zepp;,an xmas stocking filler went down very well for an ex headbanging son; now almost in his 50s a bit slower these days
1,"Paid a penny for the CD, but it was worth twice as much","One word describes it best: uninspired. It's as if they painted the word ""Quiet"" all over the walls of the recording studio. I think there's only one song where Wayne Shorter sounds inspired. Even he sounds like he's just been to the dentist and the drugs haven't worn off yet. On the positive side: it's great background music when you have no intention of listening."
2,Should work but doesn't,"The accompaniment is great... the arrangements are lush and interesting. But Scofield just solos along with no melodic intent. He seems to be filling space with meaningless improvisation. Perhaps I am spoiled by melodic masters of jazz guitar (Jim Hall, Bill Frisell, Wes Montgomery) but I was hoping for more than this. See those I mentioned for true quiet melodic perfection."
3,for older children,"I was looking for a drum for my 7 month old. The product does list as being for 12+ months. Regardless, I think the sides of the drum which you're suppose to strike, won't stand up to major pounding. Also, the drum sticks would definitely be appropriate for older kids not young toddlers. It does sound like an actual drum though...not electronic like other drums out there."
4,Fun for everyone!,"I bought this for my 6 month old son for Christmas and he liked it.. I bought it with a tambourine & he loved that more but together, it's a great set.. I get down on the floor with him and bang on it & act silly & he loves it! I do recommend removing the sticks because they're very small & that's the first thing to go in the mouth.. I tucked them away in a drawer until he's older.. It would've been better if they'd come attached but they don't also making them easy to get lost.. Overall, I was pleased & he seemed to be as well.."
2,not as described,the description for the drum said that it came with a breakaway neck strap. this was not included in the box. wanted my granddaughter to be able to march around and play the drum. amazon is great and is letting me return it.maybe will look for a different toy drum.
3,Voice actors,"I've seen on Starz Kids and Family this morning and although the movie may look cheap, It had wonderful voice actors like Jim Cummings and Jennifer Hale and the movie less of a nightmare fuel than the Disney one"
3,Good buy for the Price,"Niether the story or the animation is as good as the Disney versions. The songs, which are few, are not as good as those featured in the Disney films. However, Disney would never offer you three different stories for the price of one."
2,Code snippets; nothing works or explained; obsolete as of 2007,"This books is obsolete as of today (2007). It consists of code snips in C#, but no complete examples. Like another reviewer wrote, nothing works after the first ""hello world"" sample. If you already know ASP.NET, I suppose this book is somewhat useful, but the book is verbose; why spend a whole chapter (Chap. 2) on Visual Studio 2005? If the purpose of the book was a ""how to"", showing step by step how to build an ASP.NET project, then I could understand this inclusion, but the book is not a ""how to"" (other than a trivial example, I didn't find a single complete ""how to"" in the entire 1300 page book).Avoid like the plague--a complete waste of money and paper.UPDATE: not as bad as I thought, once I read it."
2,Good book but lacks a lot of details,"Be careful, don't get this book for beginer to intermediat topics. I found this book is missing a lot of in depth information on things like webforms etc.if they didn't want to cover it properly then don't include it in the book. it's decieving. if a book says chapter on webforms then it should actualy have a chapter on webforms and not just a few simple useless and incomplete examples.I constantly have to search the web to find what it's missing to do basic stuff. The examples are not very thorough.this book has 34 chapters. does that not seem like an awful lot of stuff to you? how could you really cover topics in detail with 34 chapter?sorry but i don't like this kind of book. i prefer a book that leaves you feeling confident. this one make me feel helpless.I will probably return it!"
5,Best ASP.Net 2.0 book,"This is indeed an excellent book. Very succinct. Thanks to the authors.To the reader that did not care for this book, it does clearly state that the User level is Intermediate-Advanced."
4,Good Reference But...,"it's too long.I rarely like books that are this long (nearly 1,300 pages) and it's because I just don't think most books need to be this long. When you write a book that is this long, it's usually bloated with material, and there is so much text that it's nearly impossible to get through. With 34 (yes THIRTY-FOUR) chapters, this book is just way way overkill. I don't want to give the wrong impression though, as this book has good content and is an excellent resource for ASP.NET 2.0 developers. If you don't mind crazy large books, then this text might be perfect for you. As it is, I have no qualms recommending this book, I just think if a couple hundred pages were trimmed off, this could have achieved the same goals and been a tighter end result.**** RECOMMENDED"
3,Good Book,"Like any book that includes the word ""Pro"" in it, you expect the book to cover most topics of ASP.NET 2.0. This book does that. I found the Cryptography and Deployment section which explained the differences between IIS 5.1 and IIS 6.0 very helpful.However, I not only like reading the concepts, but writing the code to see it work. It was difficult to take that approach with this book. The connection between the concepts and the presentation of the code examples were often scattered. I found this frustrating."
1,My Visit to Venus,"This book is an unauthorized publication. In one of the many books by T. Lobsang Rampa he states that this is so, that the drawings are not at all good and he recommends that you do not buy it as it is a waste of money. Books that are unauthorized publications should not be sold under the authors name, especially when the author has died. How do you feel about this?"
1,My Visit to Venus,"The author was definitely flying when he wrote this one. ""Strange and squirrely "" best describes it. I was very disappointed as I have enjoyed many of his other books on Tibetan Lamaism."
3,Perfect Kiss...,"A good Overall Collection of Ms. Riperton's work (at a decent price, considering it's an import).The highlights:10. Young, Willing and Able14. Inside My Love15. Stay In Love16. Lovin' YouI spent $30 for my copy (to my everlasting consternation - but, at the time, the Albums were not yet on Compact Disc - this was the mid 90's).Oh, well...My rating: 3 stars..."
2,SOFT BUT NICE!,"HUGE FAN OF TAYLOR WAYNE! LOTS OF BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND GOOD ""SITUATIONS"" HOWEVER IF YOU'RE A VETERAN OF ADULT MOVIES THIS WILL LEAVE YOU LOST A LITTLE! SOFT IS RIGHT!GOOD CAMERA WORK AND I RECOMEND IT!"
3,Cool Clubbin' song,"It would definitly be cool to dance to in a club and to jam out to in the car, but...I see it getting OLD fast."
4,Better late than never...,"I know this book was published some time ago, but it's new to me and if you can't find it in print, go to your public library! The characters and situations are so real, so engaging. I like that they are people who fight their own shortcomings, that they're flawed and imperfect and that their lives are full and messy and complicated. Things turn on small events like the flu or bad weather, just like in real life. I really enjoyed this and am now going to read Ms. Gutcheon's other books."
1,major disappointment,"This CD is a major disappointment. I would strongly advise not buying it and getting Grimaud's Brahms instead. Grimaud is known for the Brahms but the Rachmaninov CD in particular demonstrates that her playing is having trouble expanding out into different and diverse repertoire. There is heavy groaning in the background if you listen carefully during the performance, and it sounds like someone is reading off pages of music (you can hear pages turning). In order to give the best performance possible, it needs to be memorized. That way, you're focused on not reading the music but playing it with emotion and interpreting it. This CD is a disappointment given Grimaud's Brahms reputation. I wish I had not purchased this CD."
1,Stay away!,"If you look At the ingredients on the label It's full of chemicals that harm your hair. The silky smooth feeling is just a temporary result of the petroleum which locks out moisture with long term use. I found this article helpful: [...] I'm not sure how accurate it is, but why take the risk?"
1,Inaccurate and valueless,"This book is an embarrassment. Virtually every page of book titles and listings has at least one glaring error. In the area of juvenile series books it is both incomplete, full of errors, etc. Examples are easy to find- Border Boys Series incorrectly dates the publishers, Bobbsey Twins description woefully incomplete, Battleship Boys lists only a few of the titles in the series and does not mention the first publisher which was Altemus, Airship Boys Series fails to note all of the books and both of the publishers. These mistakes are just on the pages I glanced at for series books. I suspect the same errors of commision and omission exist for many other books. Get yourself Mattson's guide for series books and do your own research for anything else. This book does have a nice glossy cover. Totally form over substance."
2,Haunting,Unfortunately...there are only two tracks on this CD. On top of that its two versions of the same tune. Certainly not worth the money. But Ane Brun is haunting in the first cut. You'll want to play it over and over. I heard it on a Canadian jazz station...and never caught the name of it. Fortunately the station offered its track list on the internet. That's the way I found it.The song should be included on an upcoming CD. If it is..buy it.Rick Azar(carballada)
1,1 GREAT song HOWEVER - major dissapointment it is almost $10 for 1 song,"basically this CD is almost 10 bucks for 1 songand its remix.go to itunes and buy it for .99 centscomplete rip offTHE PRICE makes you think you are getting an entire ALBUMbut alasyou are buying a single for $10!CRAZYthe song however,,, is BEAUTIFULbut I bought it from iTunes instead"
2,Really doesn't live up to potential,"The Ring of Lightning was built on a potentially good premise- a dysfunctional family using Rings of Power to remain in command. Unfortunately this potential is largely squandered in the book's fluffy and unexciting subplots and lack of a coherent vision.The portrayal of character relationships among the Rhomandi is the best part of the book. The rest of the plot doesn't have much to it, including an unexciting subplot about a 'leythium' creature (leythium is an electricity-like energy that is the basis of the Ring's power). The deux ex machine ending also disappointed.All in all, there are much better fantasy books to read (eg LOTR, EarthSea series, His Dark Materials by Pullman). You could possibly buy this book, but don't expect too much."
3,Not what I expected.,"This game was not what I expected at all. I am a fan of the Xbox version so, when I played this version, I was very disappointed. The story line is totally different from Turok:Evolution on the Xbox. The gameplay is ok, graphics are ok. It might be ok for some but I was just so disappointed that it was so different from the Xbox version"
2,Graveyard Ghost,"This book is not that scary. I thought it would be scarier by the picture on the cover with the ghost coming out from behind a gravestone and blood coming out of his mouth. I think this book should be a funny book because it already has some funny parts, but it's not scary at all. I expectd there to be some ghosts coming out everywhere and then disappearing again. I think maybe 5 or 4 year olds would like this book because it's not too scary and they wouldn't put it down and never want to read it again."
3,where's the 5 star second story?,"I'm very dissapointed.I bought this for my daughters and after 25 minutes,they came up to me and said where's the second story?I rewinded the tape and there'a no show of the 2nd story.I would give a 5 star if there was a 2nd story,because my daughters saw it and loved it."
3,Pretty good game,"My daugher likes this game, although she has struggled in a few parts. Overall, it's pretty fun. She got the game when she was 5 and now at six, she plays it from time to time. I like that she can figure most of it out on her own."
2,"Expensive, moderately fun and poor graphics",Disney continues to market games with graphics that would have been considered to be poor over 10 years ago. It's amazing to me how they can charge so much for such a terrible product. The only recent game that I've seen that was worse than this is Disney's Lilo & Stitch Trouble in Paradise!
1,This is one of the most misleading astrology books around,"As a professional Astrologer who read this book years ago, I have to tell you that it is one of the worst depictions of what Astrology is about! If I could give it 'no stars', I would. It should be renamed to ""The Only Astrology Book You Should Throw In The Trash"" It may give some key words, but the synastry content is terrible and generalized. If you are a beginner interested in a book, try one of the Parker Books, but don't waste your time here. If you are interested in learning, you'll have to relearn all you read."
2,UH?,"As a professional Astrologer who read this book years ago, I have to tell you that it is one of the worst depictions of what Astrology is about! If I could give it 'no stars', I would.

5,Great,If you are new to learning or studying astrology this book will give you some really great basics. I would highly recommend this book for those just starting and those who already use or study astrology.
3,Misleading but interesting,"As a beginning student of astrology, I found Goodman's book interesting but misleading. Her observations of character, at least her descriptions of traits associated with ascendants, are sometimes astute. However, the reader should be warned that Goodman's book does not allow you to accurately calculate your ascendant. To do so, you must know the exact time and precise degree location of your birthplace--Goodman's chart is not accurate enough because it merely estimates degree. For example, according to Goodman's chart, I am Libra Ascendant; however, computer calculations indicate that I am Virgo Ascendant. Goodman's methods of calculating planetary and lunar influences are innacurate and incomplete as well. In summary, this book is definately enough to pique an interest in astrology but definately not the only astrology book you will ever need."
5,For better or worse it is ALWAYS right!,This book is SO on! With any new relationship I check to see what the book predicts and for better or worse it is always right. Maybe I should pay more attention to what the book says and it would save me some time and heart ache ;) The title says it all really.
4,"Clear, Concise, Insightful, and Fun",With this book you can look up practically anyone's chart quickly and easily. Joanna Woolfolk is extremely adapt in making the complex patterns of astrology understandable to all. It does not overwhelm but gently draws you into the depth that is astrology.
3,Attractive packaging........,"The book is certainly gorgeous to look at. But the title is a bit misleading. I do not think that a book that barely mentions such features as the nodes of the moon, the part of fortune or the asteroids should call itself- ""The Only Astrology Book You Will Ever Need"". It discusses the basics quite nicely in the usual cookbook formula. But like most beginning and intermediate students of astrology will tell you, this info becomes stale and repetitive. I suggest the works of Martin Schulman- his series is great. He understands that all the aspects that are relevent to the study and implementation of astrology cannot be summed up in a few hundred pages. Also Llewellyn has a series that is worth a peek. It has views and research from noted astrologers that are much more detailed and in depth. ""The Only Astrology Book You Will Ever Need"" will leave the reader with more questions than answers, in my opinion."
4,Good but could use some work,"For the most part, I find this book to be quite useful.A particular point is the assumption that all living humans are heterosexual. However, I did find a love synastry method that works with homosexual lovers (Mars/Ascendant).I guess I should say ""don't assume heterosexuality"""
4,One of the best Beginning Astrology Book You'll Ever Need,"This book could just very well be the only astrological book you'll ever need! ZodiacZone.Net is a new, but refreshing, website specializing in unique zodiac gifts & collectibles. We need to insure that our valued customers get to know what astrology is all about, and not just the hype or those pesky Hotline numbers you see on tv screen during late nights.This book is simple to read, and easy to follow. It not only distinguishes the male/female aspects of your sign, but also explains the how your planets, the Moon, etc. affect your entire outlook in life.If you are new to the astrology and you need 2-3 books, make sure that you get this one!"
5,excellent book,"this book is fun and interesting, if u r in all that astrology u will have so much fun reading this book and review any persons chart in ur life, very accurate in so many ways"
5,da bomb!,This book really helped me out. I took it to all the bars with me and asked all the girls when their birthday was. It helped me narrow the wide gaping margins between what is acceptable in another human being and not. Thank you Ms. Woolfolk!
5,My first book on astrology,"This was my introduction to astrology and it did a very good job for me. It is quite complete and easy to read. It might be more suited to people who are willing to put some work in to find out all of the different elements that affect the person being read. I was able to guess times (rising signs) of some people I know using this book - I thought that was amazing at the time. Anybody who thinks that they are a religious or spiritual person should atleast take the time to have a look at astrology, and this is the perfect book for newbies (yet comprehensive)."
2,The Only Astrology Book You'll Ever Need,"I was VERY disapponited in this purchase! First, the Kindle addition does not give you the CD so those chapters which reference it are useless. Second, the authors obsessive reference to Oprah Winfrey made the examples annoying since there are a lot of more interesting people who could have been used. I have other books on the subject, but this one was recommended by an ""astrologer"" so I purchased it. The phrase ""nothing new under the sun"" would apply to this book. And with the kindle addition, your stuck with it. Amazon SHOULD NOT sell this via kindel without the CD and if they do it should be for no more than a $1.00."
4,My guide to dating...,"I bought this book about a year ago. When I bought it I didn't know much about astrology, but I was interested in it so I figured this would be a good place to start. Being a Leo, of course I had to go through and read everything about ME first. Ha Ha Ha. Tipicle Leo,right? So, everytime I find a new beau I always find out his birthday. I lay in bed at night reading all about them. Then I always know how to start up a conversation with them. You can't go wrong when you have a secret guide to a males mind and personality. Besides, if you know their likes and dislikes ahead of time, when would you have time to argue? It's great. I've gone by the book ever since I bought it. Great info, it's almost scary how right on everything about it is about your personality judging by your stars. I love it! Joanna Martine Woolfolk, you go girl!"
4,Great Introductory Book,"This is my first astrology book. I bought three after this. Its coverage on the planets are very easy to understand and are more detail than most other books. I still come back to its descriptions of planets. Though it isn't the most comprehensive book, it is a great introductory book.As mentioned by others, this book only give you an estimated chart. But you can get detail charts for free anyway: www.astro.com, www.astrocenter.com, www.alabe.com. Or use free software astrolog or astroscan. So don't worry about that."
4,Good Book,"This book goes into alot of detail, but is mostly an overview of the signs..I prefer the actual ""days"" you were born..still overall a good book to read."
1,Lots of info but accurate?,"Usually I am very suprised by how accurate my horoscope seems to be but in this book, my personality profile could not be any further from the truth. And this was consistent with many other individuals I know and their personality traits. True, this book is all encompassing and has a lot of detailed information but its accuracy is definitely in question, in my opinion."
3,Parker Books,Parker's Astrology : The Essential Guide to Using Astrology in Your Daily Life by Julia ParkerThese are the books the reviewer below was speaking of.
1,NOT WHAT AM LOOKING FOR,"I WAS REALLY LOOKING FOR THE COMPLETE BOOK IN A CD AND NOT WHAT YOU SEND ME,THE CD IS JUST TO MAKE MY OWN CHART AND NOT THE INFO ON THE BOOK IN THE CD, IN DETAILS IS NOT CLEAR WHAT YOU SELLING IF THE BOOK IN THE CD OR NOT.AGAIN I ASK YOU IF YOU HAVE THAT BOOK OR OTHER COMPLETE ZODIAC BOOK IN A CD?"
1,Lives up to the title,"I received this as a Birthday gift a few years ago. Having glanced over the tripe presented within, I soon decided that it probably IS the 'only' astrology book I'll ever need. Four years on and I have still not been struck with an urge to seek additional counsel..."
4,Equally Scared!,"I have the first edition and that also says that George Bush is a Gemini. I was going to buy the new version (as it is no longer current and so I can't do new birth charts completely), but what if there is more wrong than just the Bush thing?Other than this mistake, that I was unaware of until now, I found the old version very helpful. I find that it covers enough information to get what I want. It is, perhaps a beginners book. I can't figure out from this book, however, how to get what planet in what sign properly. I find discrepancies between internet charts and the book, so I tend to get the planet/sign chart online and then do the houses, rising sign, etc. from the book. The first book doesn't come with a CD and I always thought that would be a great addition."
4,This is my favorite astrology book.,"I think this a an excellent book for those who are interested in astrology. It is definitely the only book you need if you have a great deal of interest in astrology. But, if you are very serious about astrology, you may find that you need other books for reference as well. I found the male/female references for each sun sign to be wonderfully accurate. I asked many people to review their personal profile and found only minor discrepancies! My profile fit me to a ""T"". I have also found that when I am having a misunderstanding with someone, it helps me to relate to them better. This is an excellent book and believe it is worth the price and more!"
4,It's all in the stars!,"This manual is easy to follow to create one's own extensive chart. This book uncomplicates the process, but reading all the phases and stages takes a lot of time to understand."
5,Great book,"This is a pretty good book. I was looking for something that would be basic, but cover all the differeent aspects of astrological data and this does a pretty good job."
3,"good book, no CD rom","I love the book. I bought it for my kindle, but I wish I could order the CD rom seperately for a cheap price as an addition. You need the CD rom in order to get your birth chart. And without a birth chart, your horoscope is very incomplete :("
4,Great resource!,"This book is very well organized and offers clear, concise explanations of all that is involved with your understanding your astrological chart. Excellent resource!"
1,No chart software and not available on site,"I just received my book after waiting 2 months. It was supposed to include chart creating software. There is nothing included with book. I have a sticker on my book: Now with an on-line chart calculator! [....]. I went to the link and it's the publishers website and takes me to the book with the option to purchase. I searched the site: on-line chart calculator. No results. Amazon, Rowman and Joanna Woolfolk have misrepresented. My purpose for purchasing was for the software. Trust me, I will be blogging and telling everyone I know."
3,Incomplete CD,"I just bought this book, so can't attest to the content itself just yet, but I am quite angry to find that there is nothing on the book or CD indicating it's only compatible with certain platforms. Unfortunately, the bookseller couldn't find anything online (nor could I) about the CD and I foolishly believed him when he said, ""It must be compatible with everything, then."" Duh--I know better. Of course, I got it home and slapped it in my Mac and found nothing but a useless .exe file. Boo. If I could only remember the title of the larger, more expensive book/CD I saw elsewhere--which specifically offered versions for Mac OR PC--I'd be returning this in a heartbeat. Hopefully, once I digest the book portion, I won't be so upset about the lack of attention they gave to the CD."
3,"A good introduction, but lacking in precision","This book gives the reader a good general idea of the natures of the 12 zodiac signs, and provides a background on many different areas of astrology which are unknown to the average person. However, it is written to be simple, and as such it treats the reader as uncomprehending - a treatment that leads to the ommision of many things that would be better told to the reader, so that they could fully understand the subject. Its charts for calculating ascendants are innacurate and unclearly explained, and the page numbers are often not as they should be. The book is good for getting the reader interested in further reading on the subject of astrology."
4,good,"this book teaches you how to cast your own chart, however i found some parts confusing, it has a good history of astrology. very accurate readings for all the signs. the cancer reading was very accurate for me. i highly recommend this book"
4,Great astrology book,"This is a really nice astrology book. I highly recommend it. I'm very happy with all the information, charts and tables that it has in the book."
2,Not the only one you'll need,"If you were born in the southern hemisphere, forget about buying this book. The charts are only for the northern Hemisphere"
3,"good to start with, but you'll need more.","This was the first astrology book I ever bought and it is definitly very insightful and helpful. It covers more than basic astrology books and help those make a simple (but not very exact) chart to find out what their signs PROBABLY are. But as for it being the only astrology book you'll ever need, it definitly is NOT. Maybe if you just want to know the basics, but if you're looking for in depth readings this is probably just a good place to start. Over all I recommend it to people with very little knowledge on charts, aspects, and their signs, but if you already know all about charts and aspects then don't waste your money because you won't learn anything new here."
3,Astrology Book Review,"Astrology is so hard for the novice. The cd that comes with this book is good for doing a quick chart, and then you can look up the information in the book. It helps in doing a chart, but I felt as though I just scratched the surface."
5,good astrology book,"I'm not really an astrology person, but was dating a woman with an interest in it, so I got this book to help me better understand both astrology and her. I found it very interesting and easy to understand, which says a lot considering I pretty much knew nothing before getting this book.It's an interesting read. The woman I was dating found it of interest also, so I think it will work for both newbies as well as people who are more advanced."
4,A Tome That Has Stood the Test of Time,"As at least one reader has pointed out here in the reviews, this book has been updated over time. And it shows.For anyone who likes their reference books to be not only informative but attractive I recommend this book.I see over half a million copies have been sold.That speaks volumes.Rosemary Breen[...]"
5,Good Representative MJQ Compilation,"I'll echo another review and agree that this is an excellent introduction to the MJQ. I've heard it said that the MJQ is the best jazz group for classical music lovers. At the moment I'm listening to ""I'll Remember April"", a slow, bordering on melancholy tune at the start. I should note that I bought this when it originally appeared on cassette tape, and that ""D and E"" and ""Green Dolphin Street"" are probably my all-time favorite MJQ tunes.The only drawback is that, at the time of this writing (August 2008), there were no sound samples on Amazon for this CD...so I'd advise checking out some of the other MJQ albums for samples. Note that some of the older MJQ albums don't always have the best sound quality, but this CD seems flawless.As one's first MJQ CD, this is a good choice...I know it was mine. Five stars."
1,Very Disappointed,"I'm not sure if it because of Windows XP, but this PC runs slower than my older compter. My dial up on the internet is slower also. Ugh .. and I tried to return it after only two days and Toshiba won't take it back. I feel like they handed me the 'hot potato"" and I'm stuck with it.I will be putting it in the paper this week, and taking the loss, I'd rather just repair my old one, the one with a different brand name."
5,GREAT WATCH!,"BEAUTIFUL, FUNCTIONAL, STYLISH PIECE OF TIME KEEPNG! VERY PLEASED WITH THE TRANSACTION, AND THE GIFT RECIPIANT WAS DELIGHTED. AN AFFORDABLE, UNIQUE WATCH"
4,Dragonfly pendant - beauty!,I purchased this necklace as a lightning deal after Thanksgiving in the hope that it would be as pretty as it looked. It was a very well received Christmas present for my daughter-in-law. It is very delicate looking while being a solic piece of jewelry. Was happy with my purchase.
5,A lovely thing!,"I wear it every single day! It is beautiful, its the right size. I've had it for a very long time and it has not yet dropped any of the stones.My 8 month-old son often grabs it and yanks on it and chews on it. Yes, I stop him but I've noticed that this is a very sturdy necklace as he sometimes pulls himself to his feet on my lap after grabbing the necklace. Amazing!I love it, great purchase!"
5,Worth it,"I got this gift for my grandmother for Christmas, and she loved it. It's very pretty and well designed. But it is smaller than it appears to be in the picture, and the chain is very thin."
4,Dragonfly pendant,"Very nice pendant, especially for the money. It is very shiny and just the right size. I do not like that ""China"" is engraved on the back but that is so small you need a magnifying glass to see it."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this on sale as a fun piece to wear because I love dragonflies.Based on the reviews, I though this pendant would fit the bill. I was very disappointed when I opened the box and found that the stones were extremely cloudy.Cloudy to the point where there was no sparkle whatsoever. There was more sparkle from the dragonfly itself than from the CZ's. I know it's an inexpensive piece of jewelry, but I expected more based on the reviews.I do however, agree with the other reviewers that the dragonfly itself is a very nice piece, but the cloudy stones render it unwearable. The quality of the dragonfly is why I gave this necklace two stars instead of one.I ended up giving to my young daughter to wear as she liked it."
5,Dragonfly Pendant,"This is a beautiful pendant. Well made, and well defined. Goes well with almost all of the silver/cubic zirconia earrings."
4,Great gift,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas. She is a dragonfly collector. She was very thrilled with this piece. When my wife is happy, I'm happy."
2,Way Smaller Than Showcased,"From the image, I thought this was fairly large. It's not in fact. I looks cheap too. I bought this as a gift and opted not to give it."
2,somewhat disappointed,"The necklace was very pretty and the individual I bought it for really liked it. However, I was very disappointed to discover, upon my sister opening her gift, that the chain of the necklace was all tangled up. It took us an hour to unknot the mess."
3,yeah its ok!,"Really if I had have heard this back in 1990 I would not have bothered to listen to any further material by the Ozrics. It is a bit too 'folk musicy' for my liking, the sort of self indulgent nonsense you get from those nameless bands you hear at folk festivals, not that I go to them. I have at least half a dozen albums by these guys and I can't get enough, well at least until I heard this. The first half of the recording seems to be all done at the same tempo and drum beat thankfully this changes later in the album but a bit too late. Yeah its ok but later stuff is better, Arborescence comes to mind as does Waterfall Cities. I even like the later stuff that everyone else seems not to."
3,Worthwhile though undercooked journey,"3 1/2Impressive modern progressive-light offering still often falls into it's own trappings with elongated, overdone yet underutilized structure amidst this space odyssey. Embellishing much of the repeated jamming with effective electronic touches, Erpland takes us down a fun, sometimes challenging, sometimes boring route painting the instrumental trip. Musicians will likely be captivated by some of the inherent talent, captured best in potent bursts of deep space electrojams, before succumbing to the eventual feeling of the more prevalent detached, methodical pace."
1,Boring Boring Boring,"Did I mention the fact that this is a Boring movie.I drank 7 beers and watched this movie.Thinking it had potential since it's about satanism and the like.Also it was suppost to have nudity in it but it didn't,at least my copy didn't.It appeared to have had 3 differant scipts of the movie piced together resulting in a big mess.Nothing scary or exciting here except a big waste of your time."
1,Prime evil,"Dumb movie about your typical Cult(cults suck) and a bunch of naive idiot followers,sadly this topic has been done ad-infinity,Cult movies are the worse."
1,Edited version,"This version of the movie is from ""RHINO"" and is edited not full version of the movie. So unfortanately I have to say I did not enjoy the movie at all"
1,Wow. Nothing to see.,"I just finished wasting 80 minutes watching this ""fright"" flick. It has some nice shots of NYC, but that's about it. On a scale of 1 - 10,Skin shown - 1 Horror - 1 Credibility - 1 Acting - 1I expect a demonic horror film to be frightening, tense, and have some clever twists. This had none. The only erotic shot (nothing sexy in the dvd)is on the COVER of the dvd. The villains were able to kill off a half dozen people without anyone investigating, and apparently no neighbors noticed.

2,Short Life Span,"I have had this waffle maker about 3 years and have used it about 20-30 times. It makes perfect waffles when you decide on desired doneness setting. Plus the heart shape is very pretty. I'd give this appliance 5 stars, but....It just died on me in the middle of making a batch of waffles. No thermostat, no lights, no nothing. Up until that point I was extremely satisfied with the product. Then after reading the different reviews it seem this is par for the course with this brand and model. As much as I loved it, I won't be purchasing it again. Too bad the company just doesn't re-do the electrical design, then I could say that this is a perfect waffle maker."
2,This didn't work as advertized.,I think they may have mixed this up with their waffle cone maker. It does not make correct wafles. Can't it does not have a deep enough pattern.
1,Chef's Choice 830B Waffle Maker Fuse Fails,"Yes, the fuse fails in the Chef's Choice 830B Waffle Maker. My wife sent it in for repair a couple of times and it came back promptly, repaired and cleaned. Then it worked for 4 or 5 times and failed after baking three waffles the last time. I didn't want to send it back for repair again, but maybe that's the best ""choice,"" so I took it apart and found the failed fuse in the upper part of the unit. It's a 240 C 10A fuse, apparently a thermal-cut-off type like the NTE 8242 Thermal Cut-Off 240C/464F sold by Amazon. But it's very annoying to have to repeatedly send it back for repair or have to repair it myself. Chef's Choice should replace it gratis. Note that the fuse is a crimp type, i.e., the wires must be crimped into some connector, not soldered as soldering will likely damage the fuse.When the waffle maker works, it works great but it's unacceptable for it to fail so soon and so frequently."
3,"When it worked, it was great, but...","I loved the unit until, after about 20 uses, it simply stopped working. I plug it in, but nothing happens. There are instructions on how to service the unit, but it must be mailed back to the factory and this seems like enough of a hassle that I have not returned it yet."
2,Good Results - Bad Quality,"This is without a doubt the cadillac of waffle irons - and, yes, it does actually cook a waffle in only 90 seconds - the waffles are a little smaller than the average cheap waffle maker, but you truly can have them crisp on the outside and soft on the inside or the same consistency throughout - absolutely loved making waffles with this, but....The fourth time I plugged it in to make waffles, it beeped like it was ready to cook but the irons were cold.Nothing in the instruction manual concerning what to do if the sucker just refuses to heat.Well, it was a good two weeks while it lasted....Just wish the waffle iron had.If this product was a car, I'd give it three lemons."
5,Great for the busy Mom,"I bought this waffle maker for $39.95 from Target in December. My previous waffle irons were larger and the plates could be washed in the dishwasher.I am loving this waffle iron. There is very little cleanup because the waffles pop out with nothing left behind. Also, the iron gets hot quickly and cooks the waffles very quickly. There is an alarm when the waffle is ready to be removed from the iron.The waffles taste very good and have good coloring. I recommend recipe 'Waffle of insane greatness' on the foodnetwork."
3,"creates thin and a bit tasteless waffles, but otherwise fine","Found the waffles to be a little tasteless. Who would have thought that the topology of the waffle would have influenced the taste, but it sure does! With the heart shapes, syrup just sort of runs all over and it tastes more like a pancake than a waffle. Other than that it was fine, but just don't expect it to taste like a crisp classic waffle."
2,Poorly Designed Product,"I've never eaten, I've never seen, was never served, nor have I ever heard of waffles as thin as this thing makes. They're barely thicker than a waffle ice cream cone. Pancakes are usually thicker. Plus timer light doesn't really work nor does the crisper setting if making multiple waffles. This is not a god product."
3,Waffle iron,This iron works fine. It tells you when the time is up & bakes evenly. The one complaint I have is the waffles are not thick enough.
4,Good unit,The unit works very well. Fast heating an cooking. Good looking. I am picky so I find the small triangles less apealing than square dimples.
3,"ok, but not crisp as desired","on the fast cook setting,even with the control knob set to 6 (highest), the waffles are not really crisp. on the slow cook setting they are crisp and crunchy all the way through."
2,It is great while it lasts,"I purchased one of these around three years ago. I love the waffles it makes. After two uses it died. I sent it in. The factory fixed it and sent a letter saying the fuze had blown and not to plug the unit in with the setting at 6, which I have never done. The unit just died again today while cooking a waffle. I have used it about 20 times. I don't understand why the company cannot fix the problem with these units.These waffle makers are so much better than the other units out there (I own several others), but the reliability sucks!!!"
2,"Has a short, happy life","Two years to the day almost, the waffle iron functioned perfectly. But then the non-stick feature failed. Three-4 months later, using PAM to prevent waffles from sticking, the thermostat began to fail, finallying baking waffles to an unedible crisp. For this kind of price, one should expect a better quality product."
2,great waffles while it lasted,"Mine died (just refused to heat) after about a year of service. It did make great waffles while it lasted. The waffles were so great that this is actually the 2nd one I purchased. The first one died, too.Seems that the unit really has a problem."
5,wonderful iron,This waffle iron is a wonderful tool. We used it without having to wade through lots of complicated instructions. The waffles come out consistent in texture and doneness. The heart shapes are easy to tear apart to give to my 15month old for his enjoyment. Great product!!!
5,The best waffle Iron,"I purchased this waffle iron for my daughter and son. They both absolutely love the waffles this iron produces. I enjoyed eating waffles at their homes so much, I purchased one for my own home. My wife likes waffles fixed at the level of 3, whereas I enjoy my waffles browner at level 5. Some people enjoy the small hearts torn apart and dipping into syrup rather than pouring syrup onto the waffle on a plate. However you like waffles, this product produces the best. Makes a good wedding present for new brides or a special breakfast for your wife and family."
2,Works great at first,"We bought this waffler maker to replace a Chef's choice wafflepro that we bought a few years ago that stopped working. This one worked great for the first four months, but now I can't get it to unstick. I clean the plates until they are perfect, and then try again... only to have another waffle that sticks and falls apart when I open the iron! It's very frustrating. I always spray the plates with oil before cooking but it no longer seems to work. I wouldn't recommend this iron."
2,Thin waffles,"Purchased December 2011. Have made several batches of waffles and tried several ways to make them raise higher, to no avail.Waffles are so thin they remind me of crackers. like the unit and it's operation but not the end product."
1,Crisp moist 90 seconds my foot!,"This waffle iron promises to cook a waffle in 90 seconds, which it does (burns actually) on one setting. If you want your waffle moist on the inside, like I do, you need to cook for over four minutes. I do like the tone feature but for [the price] forget it! You could buy two of another brand and give one to a friend!"
4,"Great, perfect atmosphere.","This is a great atmosphere CD. I had it for a long time on my Amazon wish list, and then, I ordered it. This CD allows you to enjoy a sophisticated, music, but, if you choose to, you can just lean back and chill out with the music. The trumpet sound reminds me of Mark Isham, and at times even Miles' blue tone."
4,Another unknown gem,"In my opinion, this is Ben Neill`s best cd. Excellent ""Ambient Trip"". Track 2 (Chemistry of 7) alone is worth the cd."
1,Misleading at best,"The back cover of this book proclaims it to be one about the path of the shaman.Reading it was quite a different matter. It combines neopaganism and New Age with elements of shamanism. Add in the hefty doses of New Age and neopagan ""love, light, and etc."", and the blend is nauseating. I'm sure this must be a reflection of the author's personal path, but to represent it as shamanism is wrong.I'm not sure I'd recommend this book to even a beginning paganism student. I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anybody wanting to learn about shamanism.I would not have bought this book unless it were required reading for one of my classes. (On the other hand, after having to slog through two of Gerald Gardner's manifestos for my previous assignment, a lightweight read like this was a nice break.)"
2,"A nice book, but not very useful to me","The author has a warm, inviting style, and her personal anicdotes are very nice to read, but her information just wasn't very useful to me. I was hoping for more of an educational (how to, if you will) style, but even with the firm assertation in the beginning of this book that she IS WICCAN, not Native American, she doesn't really approach the information from either way. People don't like it because they say she thinks she is teaching Native ways, but she isn't. She just could have organized her information better, and settled on which religious approach she was going to write from. I was interested in studying Shamanic practice for quite a while, but have finally become disgusted with what seems to be the general attitude the Native American shamanic community has towards Wicca and Pagans. Irregardless of if you do or do not have Native American ancestry, if you practice Wicca, you're a wanna be not worth the air you breathe. Please."
1,Forget my last review,"This book is bad,why because native americans have an oral tradition of their beliefs they do not write about it in books."
2,"A nice read, but NOT a book on shamanism","If you are looking for a guide to Shaminism, this book is not for you. Although it is an interesting book, it is by no means useful to one truly looking to start their path to Shamanism. Amber Wolfe gives some basic ideas of Shamanism and interweaves them throughout the book, but this is, in essence, not a book about the ways of the Shaman- it is a book about the ways of a witch who integrates some Shamanism into her own eclectic style. Too much of this book is celtic and wiccan influenced to truly be a useful guide to Shamanism. Much of it comprises of rather light, useless excersises, mixed in with interesting yet essentially unimportant anecdotes. I am writing this to help whoever truly wants to walk the path of the Shaman-there are many other books that will you serve you much better- don't waste time and money on this one."
5,La maestría del amor,Se lo recomiendo a todas las personas que tienen la autoestima vaga es un buen libro para todas las edades y recuerden Amate a ti mismo para poder amar lo que tienen adelante
1,Not a GUIDE,This is not a cook book. I got a divorce after applying several of this book's principals and ideals. Couldn't master love.
2,Not recommended,"Michael Habermann is a great pianist, and no pianist approaches Habermann's legacy of keeping the music of Sorabji alive and in bringing this music to the wider audience it deserves. But this is simply not the CD to start out with if you are just learning about Sorabji. This CD has none of the sex appeal or the sensuous appeal of Habermann's earlier recordings, nor does it hold a candle to the excellent recordings of Donna Amato or Yonty Solomon. Habermann's recordings of Sorabji's ""Djami"" and ""St. Bertrand"" are infinitely preferred to any of the stiff, shrill, hoarsely engineered recordings found on this CD. Look for Habermann's Sorabji release on the Elan label, or go to a used record store to get his earlier and *magnificent* Musical Heritage Society LPs of Sorabji. The Sorabji connoisseur will of course snap up this CD without a second thought. But don't expect to brag about the $money you spent on this CD."
5,Antidote to Boredom,"At a time when accurate, intelligent, and oh-so-dreary Sorabji performances are a dime a dozen, it's useful to remember that thirty years ago Michael Habermann was dishing up the real thing. Obviously nothing has changed. This is an essential CD. Thrilling piano playing. Magnificent music. Decent sound."
4,Good versions of great standards,"The songs are standards; the versions on this collection are taken from various Verve recordings. All the artists are of the first rank and most of the versions are quite good.The biggest downside to this collection is that disk three is solely instrumental, which means that it is the music only of Rodgers and not Hart. Although all are jazz standards, I would have preferred to have alternative vocal versions of some of the most commonly recorded songs. There is no vocal version of ""Where or When,"" a major omission from a collection purporting to be ""Complete."""
3,Body Types?,"Somehow, this wasn't what I expected from other reviews I had read. It is well presented and Friedlander, although clearly devoted to his theme and premise, writes ponderously and with repetition throughout the text.I had expected more cultural anthropology included in his writing, not mysticism and conjecture. Some of the generalizations caused me to question his research methods. Still, Friedlander does propose some intriguing theories."
1,what a crock!,"a friend took this product to his lab,all he found was saw dust and some things green we dont know what was. so don't wast your money."
2,Exactly what I want,"Good board and also not expensive. The material is natural bamboo. But there is a unhappy smell when I first unpackaged it. after 2 weeks, it is deformed!!"
2,"Cheaply constructed, poorly finished slab","Nothing here distinguishes this cutting board as in any more than average. The bamboo looks roughly enough glued that it could split where the different boards are joined. The ends and all surfaces show only minimal sanding. There are no grooves to trap liquids or feet for stay-in-place stability. I guess what I'm trying to communicate is that this board is no better than--and only equal to or worse than--any other bamboo board you may be able to find at T.J. Maxx for half the price it's being sold here. I suspected that such might be the case, but I was impatient, lazy and wanted a bamboo board without having to go driving for one. I regretted my choice when it arrived."
5,good,I have Received the cutting board and it is in a good condition. I love it very much. Thank you very much
2,"good looks, miserable value","Looks (and is) solid, sturdy and lasting. However, after 1.5 months of irregular use (and after taking ample care in washing, oiling and storing), the product started developing cracks on its sides. The cracks looked like the beginning of deep splits that could easily break the wood into pieces !!! I called up amazon to complain about it and to their credit they replaced the item with a brand new piece. I am about to receive the new item and hoping that it won't start splintering again. If it does, then this is the worst wooden board I have come across. I will keep the review updated !"
2,disappointed,"The cutting board warped after a couple of month's use. It is not unusable, but does not remain stable as it is warped. It has a lot of scratches too, but that should be expected for a bamboo cutting board."
3,"Looks great, but some issues","This is, at a first glance, a really nice cutting board at a reasonable price. However, I've encountered two problems with it that make it less than recommendable:First, the board doesn't lay flat. As a result, it's wobbly and has to be held in place while cutting.Second, my board started to split in half after a few months of use. Now, I probably could have done a better job of preventing moisture from seeping in, but this does suggest less than perfect craftsmanship.You could say ""you get what you pay for""--for a bamboo cutting board of this size, this one is very reasonably priced. Still, I'll look for a different model next time."
2,splinters shown quickly within two weeks,"I am not sure if mine is defective, but I can see clearly splinters from the bamboo cutting board very soon after I started to use it..."
1,Shameful,"""... occasional imperfections such as missing or blurred pages, poor pictures, errant marks, etc"" doesn't even begin to cover it, and I'd say that qualifies as false advertisement. This book has an unacceptable number of nigh unreadable pages, and a slew of undecipherable ones, which pretty much defeats its purpose as a dictionary, so it was promptly returned.This sham shouldn't even be available for sale, and I can only recommend against purchasing it."
1,expensive and died in less than a year,"This item was a disappointment. It appeared to be high quality in look and feel, but failed within a year."
1,Ridiculous product.,Never worked in my car. The cord comming out of the unit had a loose connection on the inside. You may need to push very hard to push inside the sockets. There is nothing so great about this OEM charger.
4,Convenient & Value for money,"This car charger is worth the price I paid and made my life a bit easier, as most of the time, I end up with low battery when I am about to leave the house and I dont have enough time to charge the phone. This piece of equipment is good and serves its purpose."
5,Perfect for my cell phone,I own a Samsung SGH-D900 cell phone. This charger is the one to get for this model. Its the original Samsung charger that you need.
5,Aloha!,"Incrediable footage of Hawaii. Those of you that love hawaii or wish you lived there, buy this DVD. It would give you even more reasons to love it."
3,Average,This game isn't bad but on the other hand it isn't good either. The graphics on this game aren't so good and you have no idea of where to go. (the arrows don't help either)
3,Mostly a repackaging of Bob Belden's 1991 album,"Despite its potential, this compilation feels like it was put together without enough variety of material to make it interesting.7 of this compilation's 11 tracks are taken from Bob Belden's very good 1991 Blue Note album ""Straight to My Heart: The Music of Sting"" (which itself includes 4 more tracks not included here). Good stuff, but nothing new - pick up the original if you're interested in Belden's original interpretations of Sting's songs.The remaining 4 non-Belden tracks on this disc are innocuous enough, but not worth seeking out. Artists include Cassandra Wilson, Freddie Hubbard, Flavio Boltro, and Kurt Elling. Only Elling's is at all original - the other 3 have a sort of smooth jazz/elevator music feel - certainly no extended improv or other interesting reinterpretations of the material.Belden's complete disc is better than just these excerpts, and if you want the other tracks, get them on the original artist's albums."
1,WARNING: THIS REISSUE IS INFERIOR TO 2001 VERSION!,"DON'T BUY THIS 2007 VERSION! THE QUALITY OF REMASTERS IS LOW THAN 2001 HDCD VERSION! BUY THE 2001 VERSION, THE QUALITY IS MUCH SUPERIOR!THE 2007 CONTAINS DIFFERENT OBIS, REALLY BEAUTIFUL, BUT THE SOUND REMEMBER THE EARLY VERSIONS! 2 STARS FOR REMASTERS, 5 FOR OBI!"
4,First Half Great; Second Half mediocre,"The first five songs are superb and superbly juxtaposed. They are heavy, meaning laden with sound, but with great rythym and rhyme. The first half of the album reminds me of ""Let It Bleed"", with its range of characters and tones and styles. The second half of the album will have you changing discs to listen to the Captain and Tenille."
2,The worst Roxy Music Album,"I absolutely love the two first Roxy Music albums (Roxy Music and For Your Pleasure) and I am also a big fan of most of Roxy Music's and Bryan Ferry's music after this album. Country Life however has very little resemblance with all the other things Bryan Ferry has made. It consits mostly by noisy, ""serious"" rock-songs, far from the arty, strange, romantic and beautiful sound and the unreal, almost surrealistic lyrics that Ferry usually provide. Country Life sounds more like a Lou Reed album, than a Roxy Music album. Ferry is great being Ferry, he doesn't have to pretend he is Lou Reed. There are one or two good songs on the album, though."
1,No Wonder I Never Got Into This Band In The Slightest,"Turgid, plodding music. Could barely get through a single playing of the CD before taking it hastily out of the player."
5,Country Life (Remastered),"Having listened to the remastered ""Country Life"" CD, I find it amazing that this music was originally released in 1974. Being so adept at tastefully blending various musical styles makes Roxy Music an entertaining, if not one of the truly forward thinking groups of their time. While their music defined a period of experimentation in the 70's, it's influence affected groups years later. ""Country Life"" is somewhat hard-driving compared to previous Roxy albums yet reveals an array of songs from German cabaret to choral to Country. This album has an energy that grabs the listener's attention, thanks to fine musicianship and expert production. It shows Roxy Music at their peak.""Avalon"" has proved to be very popular. Many music critics prefer ""Siren"". But for me, ""Country Music"" is the definitive Roxy Music album."
2,dissapointed with the sound quality,"My short take only relates to the recording quality: purchased this JP version of the Roxy Music classic, expecting a much higher resolution, but am quite dissapointed with the bright, lifeless sound..."
3,A bit rough around the edges........literally.,"Upon opening the container I noticed that most of the wooden bolts had rough and cracked edges. (I will try to post the pictures I took). I'm certain that I could have returned them but 15 minutes of sanding took care of the problem and saved me the aggravation.The container is marked: ""Choking hazard - Not for children under 3 years."" and ""Non-Toxic paint.""The set comes with 16 bolts, 16 nuts, 2 long connector boards and 4 small connector boards. That's a total of 38 pieces.I think my grandson is going to enjoy these!"
3,"Good box, lousy packaging",The box as a whole is well made. The little cam lock provided is cheap and should be replaced with a quality lock cylinder. This can be done easily for a couple bucks and 15 minutes. My biggest issue here is the packaging. It arrived in a cardboard box that didn't appear to suffer much abuse enroute. Inside there were three styrofoam blocks just stacked on top the unit almost if this was an afterthought. The mounting hardware was loose inside the tool box left to move around freely. The heavy steel braces had tumbled around enough to put some serious unsightly dents in the sidewalls.I suggest to purchase locally where the toolbox can be inspected for damage prior to buying. I also recommend to the manufacturer to secure the hardware or at least the steel braces to prevent damage to an otherwise fine product. Instructions provided had nothing to do with this model box.
5,Excellent book for mentors AND protoges.,"I have read lots of motivational books, and this was one of the most inspiring. The book is chock full of practical suggestions for getting your own house in order and, then, for helping others to do the same."
4,More than one mystery solved,This was a very satisfying read. Harris has a very descriptive style that is quite pleasurable for a rainy Saturday afternoon. All of the i's were dotted and the t's were crossed by the end of the book. Nothing seemed too rushed or conveniently added to solve the mystery. Sebastian St. Cyr is an interesting character that I want to know more about. I will definitely check out more of the series.
4,Historical ambiance and intriguing characters,"As part of my ""light"" reading interludes, the Regency environment of England sets a welcome tone. A good back-up when Anne Perry isn't available."
1,RE: Kindle Users Beware,"Regarding the use of this book on Kindle - it USED to be speech enabled, allowing a Kindle user to play the book in your car so you could hear it while you drove (or any other place, if you wanted to give your eyes a rest). Now, all of a sudden, it's no longer speech enabled (text-to-speech). What gives? Did the publishers suddenly change their minds? Is the support for text-to-speech disappearing from our Kindles? I bought Kindle BECAUSE it had the text-to-speech ability, and now that seems to be getting more and more useless for the books I want to buy. Horrible."
4,another satisfying St. Cyr case,"I'll acknowledge the criticisms from those who found the interjection of seemingly modern issues jarring. I do admit that while I did not find it unbelievable that a black man would own a tavern in that era, I did find the conversations that took place between Sebastian St. Cyr and the tavern owner highly unbelievable. And yet, overall, the plot was totally absorbing and the story itself a satisfying mystery tale. Not the strongest of the St. Cyr mysteries, but certainly not a weak effort. I'd recommend this book."
1,Worst Lock... ever,This lock will open with all but one of the four numbers of the combination set incorrectly. And if you pull (with your bare hands... it doesn't take much effort at all) the lock will pull apart even if you have none of the numbers in the combo correct. It's just that cheap. You might as well secure your bicycle with a piece of yarn.
2,Disappointing & Revisionist,"The author reveals his bias, apologistic views, ultra-political correctness, and lack of understanding of Economics 101 from the very get-go. And goes downhill from there. Yes I'm sure there has been corruption and mis-management by the ""authorities"" and community groups (past and present) alike, but that is tangential to the demise of ENY. I was there. If you have rent control, landlords cannot and will not invest or maintain. When housing stock deteriorates, only those who cannot afford better will remain or move in, thus giving rise to a heavy concentration of the poor and uneducated. In turn, this leads to frustration, crime, further flight of the true working class (the old East New York), and inevitable decline. Is it reversible? I hope so. But the author's schemes are nothing more than code for welfare. And that does not work. The author's views on education, law enforcement, et al, follow a similar path - PC at the expense of reality"

2,SLOW & BORING!,"I can't believe they say this game is for 5-10 yearolds! It is SO SLOW! You spend alot of time going backand forth, there is ALOT of repetition. The charactersmove slowly and you have to keep going back and forthto different spots to find different things you needto get the treasure. It is no where near as fun orentertaining as Pajama Sam, I can't believe the samepeople made this game. Huge disappointment!"
5,Super Value,"After buying and returning 2 HPze1110 laptops, I purchased this Toshiba. Boy was I really glad that those HP's didn't work! This computer is so very much better than the HP, it is unbelievable that they were the same low price. It is faster and the screen is really good. The sound could be better, but still better than the HP. I really like that I can replace the DVD-ROM with a CD-RW(actually you can just swap them in and out from the same bay). It also has 3 USB ports, one is on the right side which makes it easy to connect a mouse. It worked great right out of the box. No new BIOS to flash, no new drivers to install. (all of the above had to be done to the HP before it could use anything USB or run a DVD...and then it still had problems reading text). Had no problems with the DVD at all. I have only had it 2 weeks, but must say I am extremely pleased."
5,To clarify some misunderstanding.,"This celeron processor is Tualatin-core based. it's the same core as the P III-M. This type celeron chip could be running at 100 or 133MHz bus, coud have 128 or 256 Kb L2 cache. In this laptop, it's 133MHz and 256 Kb L2 !!! compare to P III-M, it's just short of L2 cache (256 vs 512 Kb), still it's much better than other celeron running at 100MHz bus and/or 128 kb L2.(say toshiba 1805-s207, hp zt1130/1150 on 100M bus). even some old P III just running at 100MHz bus also. I would say get it when it's [inexpensive]. it was [money] before rebate, was it???"
5,"Price Screw Up,Had To Be",I was looking for a portable DVD player and got this for only 699 after rebate.Unbelievable.Only a couple 100 more and a whole computer with 4x the screen.
1,Satellite 1805-S207 Display,"I purchased my Satellite from Circuit City 10 days ago. While plugging the AC into the rear of the laptop while holding the laptop over my desk, the display cracked. (I am very gentle with electronics and was handling the laptop correctly) I was not holding or touching the display at any time. My guess is that the display was already defective and the movement caused the display to go out. I contacted Circuit City since the laptop purchase fell within their 14 day window for defective returns. The Santa Maria Ca. Circuit City was rude and refused to assist me. I contacted their main office who did not provide any assistance either. Toshiba says they will repair the unit in a approx. 9 day turn around. I am unhappy with the quality of this product and will not be shopping at Circuit City again."
4,Wow- implicit grammar instruction that's cool!,"This book was recommended to me by a professsor who had used it with her Middle School ESL kids. After having it a week, I have to say it is fabulous. I had been looking for ways to teach grammar to my junior high kids, without tedious explanations of grammatical rules, worksheets or diagramming. The day after I received it, I was able to start the kids on a game where they could internalize grammatical rules, and demonstrate what they already understood about the deep structure of English. The only preparation required was writing a sentence on the board, and they were involved for twenty minutes. The only reservation I have in recommending this book is that it is British, and intended for adult learners. I have had to adapt some of the language to make it easier for my kids to understand."
2,Probably unsuitable for ESL or adult learners,"The subtitle of the book did use the word EFL, and perhaps I should have realized that these games are not suitable for adult ESL students. The level of most the so-called games is too low for most ESL classrooms. And the author has a very odd idea of a game. In V.2, students do a multiple choice quiz, choosing the best translation of a sentence in their native language. Activity II.5 is entitled ""Correcting homework"" and that's what it is--having the students correct each others' homework. Some are more game-like, I suppose: IV.4 has students writing irregular plurals on the backs of other students with their fingers; such words as ""genii"" and ""menservants"" are suggested. And V.4, ""We are furniture,"" has students pretending to be furniture while repeating sentences they have memorized. As the author says, ""By now some students will be bored and others will be mystified."" (p.131) Yes, indeed."
2,Of limited value,"I have to confess that I was extremely disappointed in this book. First of all, there is virtually nothing for lower levels. So you're out of luck if you're teaching a beginning or even a lower intermediate class. The second problem for me is that it's ""veddy British."" I would have to translate into American before I used it. The third, and biggest, problem is that the games require a lot of preparation. Many of them require a lot of hand-made flash cards. Do you really want to spend two hours preparing a fifteen-minute activity? The only way this would be profitable is if one is teaching the same lesson to multiple groups. When I removed all the things that were culturally inappropriate, I had only one game I could use for my lower intermediate level Arab teenagers. It was a good one that I found valuable, but it was not worth paying this much money for only one game. Two stars."
5,A remarkable story,"The Story of an African Farm is an account about a family and how they interact in a South African farm. This is a book that is hard to put down. With is unfamiliar depiction of life style unfamiliar , it still comes out as engaging, inspirational and real. This is striking thing about the story is its deep portrayal of women . This book and Disciples of Fortune are a highly recommendable books for readers who want to get a good grasps of the different perceptions and treatment of women in our world."
3,are you talking about me?,"I found this book to be amusing, but a number of the jokes about Methodists could easily be applied to many of the mainline Christian denominations. Ah, well, Methodists have never been known for being very funny."
3,Meg Hentges music,I found my first Meg Hentges CD at Dimple for $4. I took it out to the car and listened to it and really liked it. I went to the computer to get some more. Try it as you will like it
3,Lightfoot,"So many songs, put your cd player on shuffle. Classic late 70's folk/soft rock music. Got a little too much music on it but never the less a trip to nostagliaville."
4,Takes you back to the 70's,"I grew up on this music, and knew quite a few of his songs. The best one is probably ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald."" It really paints a picture. I also enjoyed the other songs that were new to me."
1,Sad song selection,"I was so diasappointed by the selection of early UA trax on this CD, it now sits in the used CD section of my favorite CD store. What could have been an awesome CD, is only mediocre at best... Sorry Thane. Where are his best UA songs, Did She Mention My Name?, I'm Not Sayin or Ribbon of Darkness??? Several songs on here are below Lightfoot average -- why Go-Go Round (very amateurish) & Pussywillows (peraps the most boring song ever written). A great opportunity -- lost..."
3,I ordered the original Gord's Gold volume 1 not this!,"The album has some of the same songs as Gord's Gold Volume II, and I will not listen to the Complete Greatest Hits much because I don't like the selections in the order they are presented. I ordered Gord's Gold Volume I when someone substituted this Greatest Hits CD. Boooo!"
1,Complete?,"Ha! Marketers. Ha! A ""complete"" Gordon Lightfoot hits CD would have to include at least 100 songs as a minimum. The one star is not for Gordo, but for the silly record people. As happens many times, business is only for the buck--to hell with everything else, like truth, beauty and honor."
2,Missing gems,"All right, I will be one of those who complain about the absence of seminal songs, rather than praise the 20 tracks selected. I agree with the two or three reviewers who noted (and missed) that fundamental songs, like Affair on the 8th Ave. (above all), or Did she mention my name are not in this compilation. To these I will add two other which I find essential (I'm running out of synonyms): The last time I saw her and Ghosts of Cape Horn. I appreciate Mr. Tierney's effort, and I know it's hard to put everything into one CD, but definitely it could be better."
5,A DIFFERENT KIND OF MAN,"have always loved his music, his voice. i have listened to this many times and suppose i will continue to do so. well worth my money in any event. dh"
5,gordon lighfoot,"Excellent service,so easy to purchase and arrived promptly. Love the cd!!!!! Had difficulty getting this cd locally and it was so effortless online."
5,Excellent Arrangement,"I purchased this disc for the Wreck of the Edmund Fitsgerald after reading about the acutal events.The songs are very well written, easy to chill out to and a bit of history!Very good disc with many good songs"
5,"Bought This Just To Have ""Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald""!","Well, let's put it this way... I already had a pretty comprehensive ""Best Of"" type collection of Lightfoot's songs. However, the song ""The Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald"" had NOT been included in 'that' collection. Though I love nearly everything he has ever written/recorded ""The Wreck"" is undoubtedly my ""favorite"" song of his and thought it worth buying another collection of his songs just so that I could have that ""classic"" in my collection!"
5,A Must-have for any Gordon Lightfoot fan,"Unlike ""Gord's Gold"", this CD contains the original recordings of all of the best loved Gordon Lightfoot songs--the way you heard them on the radio 25 years ago. This compilation has, I think, the best version of ""Canadian Railroad Trilogy"", which moves at a much higher tempo than the ""Gord's Gold"" version--a real foot tapping tune. Being a bit too young to remember Lightfoot's career in the 60's and 70's, I reeally appreciate the liner notes description of the individual songs."
5,A Canadian Treasure,Congrats to Rhino Records once again for an excellent compilation. It must have been extremely difficult to limit this single cd to only 20 tracks for this artists catalogue of hits is vast. All 20 tracks are excellent choices of folk music. Gordon's voice is superb and every song's lyric tells a story. This a folk essential that should be in everyone's collection.
5,"Exhaustive, penetrating, and wholly satisfying!",Not suggested for anyone with a short attention span. This is a massive accomplishment bringing the A to Z of occultism under one literary umbrella. An astonishing find.
4,The Secert Doctrine,"Very good reading ,Informative and a hint of humor.Very good info.for rhe theological interest I have.I did recommend this book and baught the book as gift for another inquisitive reader like me."
1,missing vol 1 again !!!,this is the second time i ordered the secrect doctrine volumes 1 and 2 and all i receive is vol 2 ....you people cant count or are incompetent ......
2,propaganda,"Has Icke pointed out, H.P.B. was probably an agent of British Inteligence. Remember that one of the ultimate goals of the New World Order is the creation of a One World Religion.Keep in mind that this book was Adolf Hitler ""bible"" and this fact alone should make u think.This book is a very clever piece of propaganda posing as a inocent(there is nothing inocent in this book) ""Spiritual Search for the Truth""."
1,This book is foolish and idiotic,"This book has no real facts and makes outstandingly stupid claims that have no basis in reality, a real waste of my time."
5,not bad at all....,With Vangelis making the boring Mythodea and Jean Michel Jarre going into lounge with Geometry of Love we are lucky that TD are still around and kicking.A very good album(although a soundtrack) after many conventional ones.It reminds their great albums of the 70's.Recommended to TD 70's fans or to anyone who wants to hear some good electronic music.
3,Old style with new sounds,"As a big fan of TD's early works (I generally dislike anything past circa. 1980) I had some high hopes after reading some reviews of Mota Atma and they proved only half realized. To describe Mota Atma as anything more complex than the albums such as Phadrea or Richochet re-composed using the sounds of albums like Lilly on the Beach would be a waste of letters. It's simply that, the general composition of Richochet, Phaedra done with the riffs, sounds and percussion of Lilly on the Beach.If you're looking for the somber room-changing mood of Phadrea or it's similar albums you won't find it here. The track ""Prophet In Chains"" contains a typical and overall disctracting drum line that (if it were not for the fact that this is a soundtrack) completely kills the mood you're halfway towards experiencing. I would have no trouble believing this to be unused tracks of Lilly on the Beach or other albums from that time."
4,"It's a SOUNDTRACK, okay!","TD has done it again. The sound is so beautiful and there is a little of something for every kind of TD fan in there. This disc reminds me an awful lot of ""TRANSSIBERIA"" in both sound and tempo. It has alot of the same feel to it. Please just remember it is a soundtrack and not an album, so yes the theme runs continuously throughout. It is always nice to get more TD. Add this one to your inventory (yes, there are that many after all) and enjoy them for what they are... great music for any age. Keep up the great work, guys!"
2,Too repetitive...,"I have been a voracious collector and listener of Tangerine Dream's music for 20 years now. This release, unfortunately, just doesn't do it for me.TD has done MANY soundtracks, most of which are very refreshing, original and memorable. Mota Atma, however, leaves me feeling somewhat dry. Many of the songs sound almost exactly the same, the only difference being softer or harder sequencers. It seems as though they could only come up with 1 idea for a song and just repeated that idea over and over.The only track that does stand out is ""Snow On Angel's Feather"" which is, to me, the type of song that made me fall in love wih their music in the first place. The rest of the songs are pretty much disposable, although it could quite possibly serve as some good ambient music to listen to while you clean out the garage, balance your checkbook, wash dishes, etc.Tangerine Dream are much more capable than what was released on this disc."
3,C- TD,"First, let me start by saying I am a lifelong listener to the music of TD. I have around a dozen or so of their cds. I bought my first TD LP in around '71 or so. but enough about me. This cd is not what I'd call one of their most creative. At first it seems to promise a little bit of their early sound (think Phaedra), but some how it just does'nt seem to deliver. When TD is at their best the songs change constantly in rythm, texture, and melody. These do not. Still, if you want cool background music while you're doing something else. This ain't all that bad."
2,Dull,"I've tried to get into this CD, but I just can't find a musical hook to attract me. It's one of the flatter and duller efforts I've experienced from Tangerine Dream, and I own and listen to a lot of their music. Quite a disappointment."
4,Wasn't what I thought it might be.,"Didn't really enjoy reading this book, in fact I quit in the last chapter or so. The subject matter is great, but the method that it was presented didn't appeal to me."
5,Fantastic book - fast service,Thanks for shipping this excellent book so quickly.It's in great shape and is very inspiring.
3,Decent SF adventure novel,"A pretty good and fast-paced adventure tale, I suppose you could call it a planetary romance; a spacefaring thief is shipwrecked on a planet inhabited by various barbaric/medieval tribes. In his efforts to get back to interplanetary society, Harrison's smartass hero plays the part of a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, introducing various pieces of technology to the primitive world. The novel is enlivened (some might say encumbered) by Harrison's attacks on religion and advocacy of moral relativism. Deathworld 2 is no masterpiece, but is definitely fun if you take it in the right spirit. I read the September 1964 Bantam paperback with the beautifully sinister brown painting on the cover and the ad for Winston Churchill's The Second World War on the last page."
2,Very Confusing,"This journal was awful in the fact that it starts counting from the actual day you conceive, not the day of the start of your last menstrual cycle. Every other book and my Dr. goes by the start day of your last cycle and bases pregnancy on a 40 week time period. This is based on 38 weeks and therefore confused the heck out of me when talking to anyone about how far along I was. It did have some great thoughts and advice on nutrition but for a journal I wouldn't waste your money."
1,"A note about the 2011 Robert Palmer ""remasters"":","Unfortunately this is yet another batch of ""remasters"" that follows the trend of mastering the music for earbuds and not a proper stereo system. The music is compressed, tinny and shrill. The low end is virtually nonexistent.If you care about the quality of sound in your music and are a fan of Robert Palmer's catalog you would be doing yourself a disservice by getting these 2011 editions. I suggest you hunt down the original Island Records compact discs from the early 90's. They still sound quite good. I know because I went running back to them after hearing these."
2,Detective Palmer,"CLUES is good but not one of Robert Palmer's best. The album did spawn a couple of hits,LOOKING FOR CLUES and JOHNNY AND MARY. There's also a cover of the Lennon-McCartney composition NOT A SECOND TIME which was recorded by the Beatles in or around 1963. Palmer wouldn't have another hit album until THE POWER STATION in 1985. What was Palmer trying to do standing in the ocean with a portable radio and headphones over his ears? I dedicate this to the memory of Palmer who died suddenly of a heart attack on September 26,2003."
1,Overpriced,"I purchased this book with lots of hope for its usefulness. Sorry to say that I was extremely disappointed. The format is tedious. The references and referrals to timely resources are outdated. The author's style is pendantic and verbose but at the same time stingy when it comes to the ""how"" of working with this curriculum. While supposedly useful to a wide variety of ages and levels, it is really only useful to a small audience and requires an excessive amount of preparation on the part of the instructor or parent in order to get the full benefit from the materials. Definitely not useful in group settings as it is marketed in some sectors. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this material. There are plenty of websites out there that are much more user friendly offering much of the same information for free."
2,The author does injustice to his own basic contention,"Cobbett's work is so laced with invective and discrimination, that he does injustice to his own contention (as described by Francis Cardinal Gasquet) that ""Viewed in its social aspect, the English Reformation was in reality the rising of the rich against the poor"" (pp. vi). A vastly superior (though quite difficult) work with this same premise is Eamon Duffy's ""The Stripping Of The Altars."""
5,"This really ""rips""!","After a short period of success with The Power Station,Robert Palmer returned to being a soloist with RIPTIDE. The title track was written in 1935,according to the copyright information. ADDICTED TO LOVE was one of 1986's most popular hits. ""Weird Al"" Yankovic later used the music with his lyrics to ADDICTED TO SPUDS. HYPERACTIVE was another hit. So was I DIDN'T MEAN TO TURN YOU ON which was later covered by Mariah Carey. The video for ADDICTED TO LOVE featured Palmer,dressed in a tie and slacks,flanked by beautiful ""mannequins"". The video for I DIDN'T MEAN TO TURN YOU ON was the same except,I think Palmer wore a jacket. An edited version of ADDICTED TO LOVE appears on ADDICTIONS VOLUME 1,released in 1989. I dedicate this album to the memory of Palmer who suddenly died of a heart attack on September 26,2003."
5,Call me a psychic,"The first time I heard Addicted To Love was shortly after release of this album. This was in late 1985 and BEFORE the label released the single. After waking the neighbors by cranking Addicted to full volume, I was moved to write Robert a letter telling him this was the song that would revive his career in America. Of course, I was right. Robert's secretary wrote back and said that he appreciated the letter (sure he did). This album jams with the cover of Cherelle's I Didn't Mean to Turn You On, also. Am I the only fan of this album?"
4,Turn It On,"Robert Palmer really hit the big time with his eighth studio album, Riptide, released in November of 1985. He had experienced some minor chart hits, but it was his work earlier in the year with the super group Power Station that laid the groundwork and sound template for Riptide. The album features Power Station band mates Andy Taylor & Tony Thompson on guitar and drums respectively and Power Station's producer Bernard Thompson produced and played bass. Of course the major hit was the MTV staple ""Addicted To Love"". It is a straight up classic with its catchy chorus, popping synth and searing guitar solo. The song still holds up over twenty-five years later. The album doesn't have a truly weak song. ""I Didn't Mean To Turn You On"" is smooth and silky , ""Hyperactive"" has a frenetic beat, ""Discipline Of Love"" has a hard edge and ""Trick Bag"" has a bouncy feel."
1,absolute crap,"this product is absolute crap, do not waste your money. If it is actually leather ,i have never seen such cheap leather, the holes tear out, the buckle falls off, and the studs come out. bad, bad product"
5,Must Have,"The Cranberries Treasure Box is amazing! The box design is cute and charming. Even if you are a fanberrie and own all the c.d.s already you still need this to complete your collection. Every c.d. is remade and includes extra tracks from when that particular c.d. came out so that means you will get every c.d. again but with extra (hard to find) tracks. There are 21 total extras in the whole set. And they are all great, My favorite extra track is ""So Cold In Ireland"" There is also I really neat song it is a preformance by:Doloras and Pavarotti called Ave Maria. This is one of the coolest things I spent my money on worth ever cent!"
5,A Wonderful Treasure Box,"Every single Cd is marvellous. If you love Cranberries, you should purchase such a magnificent item.This is people's chance to listen to Cranberries B-Sides, and be aware of how wonderful these songs are. I also love Dolores O'Riordan voice.If you have the opportunity and the means to buy it, do not waste your time... You will be really amazed with this product.In simple words, 'I love my treasure box'...Get your own soon!!!"
4,Terrific team,Very cool jazz at it finest. Getz and Evans play their music beautifully in a mix of serene and post-bop. A great team
2,not their best work - Stan Getz vs. Bill Evans,"not their best work.they are playing against each other not with each other. no chemistry.See Stan Getz and Bill Evans ""But Beautiful"" for a good performance by the same two principals."
2,Not the easiest book to follow,I found that this book was very difficult to follow. It was often worded poorly. There were few examples and the problems did not relate to the reading. I only worked through the first 8 or 9 chapters and can't picture it getting much better. To make it through this book have a strong understanding of statistics. It is a shame that this is the standard the most graduate school expect you to have used. most of my class went out and found copies of kittle & kromer. much better book.
4,Difficult but worth while,"This as an excellent reference, but very difficult to follow, especially without a strong background in differential equations and other higher level Calculus. A good solid understanding of differentials and probabality distributions is a must. Unbelievably thorough, however, Reif leaves nothing to chance. Good luck getting a hold of a solutions manual, however, they are as rare as hens teeth."
2,not a good book,Too wordy. Reads more like a philisophical tome than a physics book. Not even a good reference. Not enough emphasis on building problem solving skills. Exposition is murky at best. Not a good book for a first exposure to the subject. Makes me wish Kittel & Kroemer was still in print.
2,Not that great,"I think this book is an example of what sometimes happens when popularity overtakes quality. This book is definitely popular. Some might even call it a classic. But it can't really compare with newer thermodynamics books that more closely follow the modern approach of teaching thermo. It would not be fair to say that the book is incomplete, as it covers all of the necessary topics. However, it does a fairly good job of making the subject more boring than it needs to be. And to anyone who has learned thermodynamics must realize how serious a charge this is. The single biggest obstacle to students struggling to learn thermodynamics is that they find the subject boring, and this book doesn't do anything to help the situation."
2,Difficult to understand,"I used this book during my undergrad years and found it so dry, that I had to drink a few glasses of wisky before I could jump into it. There is no question that the author knows his stuff, and that he has presented alot of important topics, however, it's just too dry. To this day, I can't remember a single thing I learned from that book."
4,bestest books eva!,"These series of books is about a girl called madison finn and it basically tells you how she copes with school life. In this book, while her best friends are on vacation, she meets a new girl who had just moved in her neighbourhood & is in the same school. Who knows, maybe madison had just found a new friend......"
1,bad book,This was not a good book. I found Madison unlikeable and irritating. Same way I found the book. I don't recommend this.
5,Great Book,"I really like this book.It's about Madison Phin a (alomost 13 year old).When Madison's best friends are away at camp Madison is very lonely and bored.Until one day she meets Fiona a new girl in her neighborhood.But Madison is uncertain about her friendship with Fiona.Is it all right to have 3 Best Friends's? Will Egg,Aimee, and Fiona get along? Madison is also worried about change, everything is seeming to change to her.This book was really good and you can relate totally with her if your a preteen! The only thing I didn't like about this book is that bigfishbowl.com isn't real!!!! Which I wish SO hard it was!!!!!Read this book and the whole sreies you WON'T regret it!!!!!!"
2,"Bad Writng, Dull Storyline","This was proabaly one of the worst written books I have ever read. Madison is constanly saying stupid things like, ""thats cooler than cool"", or ""thats so bizzaro' Another thing is, shes to nice! She doesnt have much of a pesonality. When you think about it, this is not what kids act. As for the story, Madsion complains about how much she misses freinds Egg (theres a REALLY stupid reason why hes called that) and Aimee. I think the author just thought kids thought names like Egg are cool, though she trys to hide this behind the fact that hes called that because he got hit by eggs one year on Halloween...Very boring story line. This is one of thse books that you count how many pages are left until you FINALLY finish the story.I started out liking it, but it got worse and worse, and the authors writing started to decline. If you feel you MUST read this book, borrow it from a freind or the libary."
4,Great book about an average 7th grader!,This was a great book! I could relate to what she does because I just started 7th grade too. I love the series!
3,A normal girl?,"I read the book and I liked it. it is a nice story about a lonely girl through her summer vacation before starting jr high. it is very well written, yada yada yada. The problem is that it is not completely realistic. her problems are having to watch wrestling with a friend of hers and waiting for school to start.she doesn't even have to bisect a real frog and her school is big, nice, and has decent luches. she is pretty and has a great body. she has a best friend who doesn't fight with her, and has a cute boy crushing on her.she has a great relationship with her mother and her father, even if she seldom sees him. to make the long stoy short, her only problem is having an old scanner."
4,Great! A New Series!,"Madison Finn is sooooo bored! Her friends are off at summer camp and she is here, in Farhills, New York, all by her herself! When she makes a new friend, Fiona Walter, and a keypal, Big Wheels, her summer plans become better and better. A great new series that has begun, and many readers. I read this book two years ago and yet I still read Madison Finn books because they are awesome!!!!!!"
5,Almost Alone,"The book I am reviewing is Only the Lonely, a Madison Finn Series. This book is written by Laura Dower. I think this book deserves five stars. I loved it. It is about a girl named Madison Finn and her life as a teenage girl. The book talks about her new friend Fiona and how she feels about her. The book has a lot of e-mails and internet chatting between Madison and all of her friends. She is super nervous about going to seventh grade. She over reacts a little too much. The only two people who were available for her are Fiona and her pen pal, Bigwheels. Her two closest friends, Aimee and Walter have gone to summer camp. When her friends came back they chatted a lot. She felt a lot better about going to seventh grade. I'd recommend this book to all teenage girls."
2,Buy something else....,I bought the Eureka Harmony after reading reviews of it. I will never buy another Eureka Harmony again. The wheels and the nozzles scratched my hardwood floors. To buy the hardwood floor nozzles you have to buy the Harmony with the attachments (not sold seprately) for another $150.00. It is big and clunky and the cord is not long enough. It is light and very quiet to operate.
5,Pleased,"I found the Eureka Harmony at the Allergy Sufferers site; it was given a good review. I then checked other reviews of the vacuum on the web which were also good and ultimately, I bought a refurbished model of the vacuum. I am delighted with the vacuum. The suction is excellent; the machine is solid and attractive and I have not found it to scratch my lovely hardwood floors. It is true that it is a slightly heavier vacuum and that the cord is a bit shorter than I would like, but the vacuum cleans so well and having the Hepa filter in it, leaves the air in the room smelling wonderful, not dusty as results from most vacuums. Perhaps the only disadvantage to the vacuum is that the refuse bag is small, not readily available for purchase, and somewhat expensive. But, I'm so delighted with the vacuum that I am buying one for a relative. I note that I have the Dyson vacuum as well, and honestly, I would take the Harmony over the Dyson."
2,Life is Cheap,"Althought the writing is decent, the story doesn't seem to go anywhere. Chat, Flirt, Hack, Die, Chat, Flirt, Hack, Die. Sorry, I hope I didn't spoil anything for anyone. If your looking for a bunch of sensational fights, you'll enjoy the book. If you want a little more depth, try one of his other books."
1,Where's the plot?,I've read almost all of Ed Greenwoods works and I really have to say that this series wins the cake on the worst one yet. It starts out with promise but the further you get in the book the more it seems to insult your intelligence. The main characters mainly go through the last one and the this one as well just fighting an endless host of people with swords and magic. Through pure luck they continually win and if they get beat someone comes along and saves them at the last minute. There is really no plot development and it gets way too mind numbing. I made the mistake of reading the next two out of boredom and kept hoping that something would happen. IT NEVER DID!!! Even if you love Ed Greenwood please avoid this series.
2,Frantic...,"Having read half of this book, I remember why I don't care for Robin Cook. Unlike a previous reviewer, I found ""Abduction"" a far better, more enjoyable read. The main character in ""Fever"", Dr Charles Martel, is frantic to the point of being obnoxious. I can understand a father's being upset about the miseries his life has delivered to him, but the development of this character leaves me unsympathetic toward his plight. I make a point of finishing every book I start, but this may be my Achilles Heel..."
3,Unbelieveable characters,"This book is a page-turner. However, I felt that the characters, especially Charles, could not possibly have had the emotional/physical ups and downs as fast as they took place. Any normal person would have dealt with his problems in a more sane, caring manner."
1,Real life...not a chance,"The medical aspects of this book are inaccurate. It is clear that Dr. Cook has not cared for patients with leukemia, or has chosen to take dramatic poetic license. If I were not a physician who cared for such patients, I might have enjoyed it, but I was too distressed by the lack of understanding of the science."
4,Good! But where is the last Come What May?,The cd was very good and i enjoyed it. I only wish it had the green fairy song. But I wouldn't care if they only had the reprise of Come What May! That is the best song in the movie and I cried during that part. Maybe they'll have another cd in the future with the other still missing songs?? All in all that is the only dissapointing part of this cd.
3,Disappointing,"I first bought Moulin Rouge 2 soundtrack because I wanted the songs from the movie w/ the actual singers. But there's little of that on this soundtrack. It's a good compliment to the first soundtrack, but my collection still feels very short. Even with both CDs, I am still missing the *original* versions of the songs, sung by the actors, as they are sung IN the movie. The ones sung by the actors are remixed for the soundtracks, and most of them are not sung by the actors. There are a couple of instrumentals on this CD as well, which personally I don't care for. I bought the CD because I wanted to hear Ewan and Nicole sing, not a bunch of instruments!If you're a Moulin Rouge fan, this is a good addition to your collection, but you'd be better to just record all the songs with a tape recorder if you want the real versions!"
4,Where's the Music?!,"I enjoyed the first soundtrack, and I enjoyed this second soundtrack as well. ""Like a Virgin"" has become a surprising favorite.However, I was really disappointed that the remixed faster paced version of Come What May was not in the second soundtrack. I find it odd that they made a video for the song (included on the DVD), play the song on the website, but not put it on any of the soundtracks! Bummer! What's the point of getting people who watch the DVD or visit the website excited about the music....then not give them access to it?I hope they come out with a 3rd album soon that has the rest of the music."
5,Woohoo,Alright! The perfect compliment to the first soundtrack this has the rest of the song apearing either briefly (Meet me in the Red Room) or completely (Like a Virgin & Spectacular Spectacular)It also has several very nice instramental tracks including the closing credits which I was really looking for when the first ST came out!Meet me in the Red Room is a great song and I am glad to finally hear it all.The Come What May is excellent and has the whole scene version.A must have for Moulin Rouge fans.
3,Beautiful ... but incomplete.,"I'd been waiting for this CD ever since I fell in love with the movie in the theaters. While it does capture some of the original music from the movie, it is nevertheless incomplete. Most noticeably, the music from the tango scene (Roxanne with Ewan's singing interlaced) is not on this CD. Also missing is the music from Hindi and the fun ""Spectacular, Spectacular"" improvisational song while in the Elephant. I also would have preferred that the music contained in this CD be taken directly from the film. It sounds like the songs have been remastered or re-recorded to eliminate the movie feel (drat!)."
2,No Sparkling Diamond,"I was really looking forward to this disk, now I'm annoyed. Of the tracks I was hoping for we only got the ""Show Must Go On"", and the ""Bolero End Theme"". No Can Can remixes (which I was *really* looking forward to), none of the really fine instrumentals in the film. So overall I would not recommend this disk unless you are a diehard compleatest like I am. Maybe I'll just take the tracks off of the DVD...."
1,Where's the Film Score for this film?,"Elton John and Jule Styne are all well and good, but some of best musical moments in this film are provided by a sometime subtle, sometimes not-so subtle film score recognized by the Golden Globes and totally ignored by the Oscars. Tone deaf as usual."
2,Very Disappointing,"All in all, the first soundtrack was more worth the money. Most of this album is instrumental tracks or remixes of Your Song or I'll Fly Away. While the presentation of Like A Virgin, The Show Must Go On and Spectacular Spectacular is well done, they leave key elements out of other songs or just leave them out period. The aca pella intro to Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend is missing (how can you take that out!?), Gorechi (where Satine sings as she coughs), and other peices that made the songs so together are just gone. All in all, very disappointing. Surely Lurhman could have done a REAL soundtrack for a movie that has become a possible reemergence of musicals in cinema. Obviously not...either that or the money lenders are smelling money a bit further down the road...like at a 25th anniversary."
2,Just ok,"I was not real thrilled with the content or the mix. Music is ok but nothing special, kind of a disappointment"
4,Still lacking...,"For those who got the first volume and found it lacking this fills in some of the holes including ""Like a Virgin"", ""The Show Must Go On"", and ""The Pitch (Spectacular, Spectacular)"". The original film version of ""Come What May"" is included which is nice but I was still left looking for the finale version of ""Come What May"" and the first dance mix that blends ""Lady Marmalade"" and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" along with some other songs thrown in. Instead of these they put in such songs as a remix of ""One Day I'll Fly Away"" which I didn't really care for and ""Meet Me In The Red Room"" which I can remember hearing the melody I think but other than that it doesn't ring a bell. If your a die hard fan, get it to complete your set. I'm now hoping for a 3rd volume but I don't think they have enough to give us that."
2,Very Disappointed in Baz,"I was so excited when I heard that a Moulin Rouge 2 soundtrack was coming out, I marked it on my calendar. I got the soundtrack and it seemed to be missing songs I thought would be on there. I bought it anyway (much to my chagrin) and started listening to it. There was no Can-can remix, no Sound of Music, and worst of all, NO FINALE SCENE RECORDING! I was so angry with myself and with Baz Luhrman. The soundtrack, except for 2 or 3 new tracks, leaves the listener wanting. Unless Baz plans on creating a Moulin Rouge 3, I will never be satisfied."
1,I liked the first - two is too many,"I don't own the second cd. I don't plan to. I love the first Moulin Rouge cd and think it's one of my best. A true MASTERPIECE! There are songs left out of it, thats true. But the second cd doesn't include the elephant love medley and has a very nice redition of your song and come what may. I wasnt at all let down. It's true the cd doesnt include some of my more favorite songs, and does contain some that aren't so great. I love them still. The cd is directed to the pop world, but the songs are in no way unbearable. I'm outraged at the way people are trashing the first and I think owning two cds is excessive. I would not buy a third. I don't feel at all let down by the first cd. I highly recommend buying one or the other of these two cds. But two is too many."
1,I bought this CD after reading other people's review's ...,I was very disappointed ... there doesn't seem to be a good soundtrack of this great musical... to date. I few songs sounded similar to the one's in the movie ... and yes they were Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor but the CD is incomplete. Half the songs are missing and others are just instumental with no singing. I don't know why the other people gave such a good rating ... I know music ... and I've bought soundtracks before and have never been so disappointed ... but such a great movie without even offering a good soundtrack? I don't get it?!
1,Oy vey...,"Don't get me wrong, I love ""Moulin Rouge"", but whose idea was this piece of garbage, and what was the point of it? Just a bunch of extra tracks that can be found in the movie. Seesh...what a waste of money."
4,The missing pieces - but still not all!,"""Bolero"". That alone is the reason for purchasing this soundtrack. ""The Show Must Go On"" is the second reason. As for the rest - well, it's wonderful to have copies the Major film songs which missed the first soundtrack, but there are also some unfortunate remixes that just don't work for me.Also - much like the first CD - this is *not* the type of music you can play when your grandmother is visiting. But hey, it's ""Moulin Rouge"" and sometimes that's the only thing that matters."
4,A Soundtrack for the Musical Purist,"If you enjoyed the movie ""Moulin Rouge"" and bought the original soundtrack released, you probably wondered the same things I did. Why were there none of the instrumentals from the film? Why were some songs missing? Why was the song ""Come What May"" remixed from the original film version? The Volume 2 soundtrack answers these questions by giving you the original film versions of songs as well as the songs that did not appear on the first soundtrack, like ""The Pitch (Spectacular-Spectacular),"" ""Like A Virgin,"" and ""The Show Must Go On"" to name a few. ""Come What May"" is in its original version, just how it was heard in the movie.I own both soundtracks. Although I enjoyed the first one, it was obviously manufactured for the hip-hop market, which I am not a part of. I definitely was glad to see Volume 2 come out. To me, the best part of ""Moulin Rouge"" was the music. If you are of the same mind, then this soundtrack is an essential addition to your collection."
2,Caveat Emptor,"I rented Moulin Rouge and loved it. I bought the first soundtrack, and enjoyed it immensely. But after purchasing Moulin Rouge 2 and listening to it, I felt that I had wasted [money]. ""Your Song"" (#1) is a nice ballad but doesn't seem to go anywhere. ""Sparkling Diamonds"" is ok but the verson on the first MR cd is better. The Tony Phillips remix of ""One Day I'll Fly Away"" is awful (minor keys and dischord). ""Come What May"" is so-so but the version on MR (1) is better. ""The Pitch"" (taken directly from the film) is quite good. ""Your Song"" (#8) is respectable. (Enjoyable if you like background music.) ""Ascension/Nature Boy"" is slow moving. ""Closing Credits"" is (surprisingly) very enjoyable. (It's unique and intriguing.)The diehard MR fans may enjoy this album. But for the average fan, you may want to think twice before purchasing. (Borrow a copy first, if you can.) It's possible that this album may ""grow"" on a person, but I am not 100% sure.In any case, caveat emptor. :-)"
4,Spectacular Spectacular,"I was thrilled when I happened across this 2nd CD from Moulin Rouge. This CD finally picks up where the other one left off.The film version of ""Like a Virgin"" and ""Spectacular Spectacular"" were both here, along with ""The Show must Go On"". The comic nature of the first two alone were worth the purchase of the CD.I found it to be very enjoyable, and doesn't rely on songs from the last CD to fill space. This can stand on its own. To Moulin fans, I have to say this is well worth your listening time!"
3,Don't... leave me this way...,"After giving the 2 a much anticipated listen, I resigned myself to the fact that someone in Moulin Rouge land is just toying with us addicts. Don't get me wrong, the 2 is great. Love it. But I am not fulfilled. It did not live up to my Green Fairy, Come What May finale expectations. All we can do is hope they get a final (i.e. the rest of the score) to us quickly. Quit holding out on us, Baz- you are robbing your people of their Freedom, Beauty, Truth and Love!"
4,"MR fans will want this one, too","I'm very pleased with the CD, though I won't be retiring my CDR burned from the DVD... as with the first CD, the versions on this release were tweaked to fit the final cut of the film, and appear in their ""original"" mixes here. For example: in ""On With the Show"", the seamstresses vocals are mixed MUCH higher in the film than they are on the CD. The CD version is great listening, just not the film mix, and buyers should be aware of that going in. I'm very happy to have these clean, professionally crafted songs, even if they're not quite as I know them from the film. (My neighbors may not be quite so pleased.)As another reviewer mentioned, there's little of Craig Armstrong's score here. I wouldn't mind a third release to tidy up loose ends."
2,Terrible Sounding,"Although the mixture of songs is good, the fidelity and sound of the ones that are the ""movie version"" are terrible. You would be better off taking your DVD and burning those songs yourself. I was very very disappointed and would not recommend this CD. Given the quality of everything that had to do with this movie, I feel that the producers just whipped this together in order to make more $$$!"
3,CAN'T CAN'T?,I'd rate the tracks on this CD a 5...but without Can-Can the album's a 3. That's my favorite part of the movie - I guess I'll just have to put my recorder up to the T.V.!
2,Buy it for Bolero,"I was dying for bolero, now i'm cured. Still waiting for Zidler's Rap. Outside it may be tragic, in here it's always magic. Wish Number 2 had come out a week before, for our Moulin Rouge themed wedding. Can't wait for disc 3.I was so excited that this cd had nature boy on it, but I'm still waiting for the John Leguizamo version. I was very happy with meet me in the red room. very strange cd. not at all what i was hoping for. still waiting for the original score."
4,Nice Extra,"I like this cd. It has a better flow to it than the first soundtrack. The first one felt choppy. Sure, two different instrumentals of Your Song are a bit excessive and I wish the Green Fairy and Teen Spirit songs were included, but these are flaws I can overlook.Bolero is awesome-I love it, I can't get enough of it. That is reason enough to buy this cd. Meet Me in the Red Room is a really cool song that I was very surprised to see. I don't care too much for this version of Sparkling Diamonds-it feels like it has holes in it because the conversations that were going on aren't included.The Show Must Go On is a truly wonderful rendition of the little-known Queen song of the same name. Do yourself a favor and hunt that down too. There is another cd out there that contains the original versions of all the songs from the movie, as long as permission was received to release it, of course."
3,Would've Been Unnecessary,"This Album is great because it contains all the missing tracks that the Original Sountrack should've had, the likes of Spectacular2X, Like a Virgin, Material Girl, & Meet Me in the Red Room as they had been sung in the movie.Thing is it would've been one killer sountrack if I could have 2 album in one package. It seems to me that one album could've contained all of the songs in the film, should the producers just concentrate on the material in the movie.This makes me feel like it's just another marketing ploy aimed at making people part with their hard earned money."
2,Very disappointed,"I was very impressed with the first Moulin Rouge Soundtrack but felt that its was missing a few key songs including The Pitch, Like a Virgin,and the song that sampled that infamous Nirvana tune that was used in the beginning of the film when Christen first came to the Moulin Rouge. I was excited to know that a second soundtrack was coming out - but I am very disappointed. How many times can they redo Nature Boy, and Your Song. I am not interested in all the instrumentals that were inlcuded in the 2nd soundtrack! I am happy with Like a Virgin and The Pitch. Bolero which was used for the end credits was a nice surprise - the rest I could have done without! How about a true soundtrack that features ALL of the music from the movie!"
5,Perfect,"The second disc of the Moulin Rouge! movie soundtracks is absolutely amazing. The gorgeous melodies composed by Craig Armstrong would be such a shame to lose without this second release. The movie versions of the songs make you feel like you're right back in the film. The music is so vivid and emotional, it's impossible not to fall in love."
2,ARGHHHH Very disappointed,"I want the actual soundtrack from the Baz Luhrmann Moulin Rouge. But it does not seem to exist. True, this ""volume 2"" contains a few actual songs from the movie...but then there are beautiful songs like ""Some Day I'll Fly Away"" in a horrible Re-Mix. And I mean horrible. I sounds like a cheap Karaoke machine. SO sad. I had the real songs on my Media Player, but now for some reason, I no longer have the right to play them. SO I know they exist out there in the cyber world. WHY OH WHY can't I buy them. PLEASE BAZ you made all that fantastic music, let us have it. PLEASE!!!"
4,Absolutely breath taking,"I really feel that this album allows the fans of moulin rouge to grasp the true beauty of the movie again. Although the first soundtrack of moulin was pleasing to such a fan's ears because of the egar state i was in to experience the magic it held, I realised after buying moulin rouge two that all the power which was delivered through the music in the movie was contained on this brillant CD. The song which would have really made the album a 5 five star product is El tango de roxanne (the real version) which i hope will come out someday soon ,But despite that factor moulin 2 is still a fantastic album"
2,Get it right already!,"can they please make a CD with the ""Come What May"" Reprise from the end of the film??? Just make a CD with the entire, unadulterated film sound track on it and we will all be happy"
2,Stick with the First CD,I loved the first CD. I played it almost raw so I was very excited to get the second with the remaining songs. I was not impressed. There is a lot of repetition from the first CD. There were only two songs that I felt was even worth the purchase. I would recommend sticking with the first one and saving your cash!!
3,A few glaring omissions...,"Although I love the new mix of ""One Day I'll Fly Away"" and enjoyed having ""Spectacular, Spectacular"" on there, and of course ""Like A Virgin"" is a treat, I was really disappointed to find that they left off the a capella beginning of ""Sparkling Diamonds"". This was cut short on the first soundtrack...why did they make the same mistake twice? The most glaring omission, however, comes between ""The Show Must Go On"" and ""Ascension/Nature Boy"". Where is the Finale of ""Come What May""? That song alone is so amazingly passionate, it deserves it's own single. Moulin Rouge 2 is a nice addition to your collection if you're a huge fan of the movie, but otherwise it may not seem like much. Stick with the original soundtrack for the ""hits""."
4,Great but still missing some songs,"I think they should have added the first song that was playing when they walked into Moulin Rouge - the one that had clips from Smells Like Teen Spirit. Plus the songs from the show where she sings to him to try and get him to return. Then the whole cast joins in with other parts to the song. That was a great and should have been included on this CD. That was the most disappointing part about the CD - you expected it to have all of the songs that were left out but it didn't and it had a couple of songs I didn't really care about, like the One Day I'll Fly Away remix."
2,Moulin Rouge - Soundtrack 2,"I think if you own the first Soundtrack CD, this CD does not add much value even to a fan of the music and movie of Moulin Rouge. I am rating this CD only with 2 stars because I own Soundtrack 1. I think there are too many repeats on the two CDs. Would have been better to just make the first Soundtrack CD larger and include more songs."
5,i love dbz!!!!,"well,my dbz legacy of goku is in the mail but i cant wait till it gets here and ive heard great stuff about this game,this name linda halford is not me, i dident want to be a member my name is Ben riley"
4,I don't know how good it is so I gave it 3 stars,I don't know a lot about this game but I'll tell you what I do know. You start off as Goku. You have health and ki. Ki is the stuff they use to Kamahama's and stuff. This basically follows everything from the show 'till the Frieza saga. You can shoot Kamahama's and and other blasts. This is an action/rpg game. You have to build up ki and skills while battling people. I heard they're making a dbz game for Gamecube and that you cna hook this up to it. I also heard this is the first in a three part installment of dragonballZ games. That's all I know.
4,GOOD GAME,"Good game for a gameboy. but seeing as this being dbz i would have came out with a x-box, ps2, gamecube game first. Then the gba verson,and i would not come out with a card game so early, because that what happen with pokemon;thats what made pokemon jake,thats what made pokemon go down. i say start with this game first then bring in the other,in like a year, but bring out this game first. dbz and dbgt are good shows that are going to go on for along time just dont over play them.thank for hearing me,Vasel19yrs. old"
1,DragonballZ's downsides,"Although the game was kind of fun, it was really short and took me less than 3 hours to beat. The highest level you can get to is 25, and after you beat the game there are no special features, like starting over with everything you have or getting to be a supersaiyon the whole game! Also the supersaiyon ability only raises your speed, you don't even get stronger! Overall, the game isn't one to waste [$$] on. I think if it went down to about [half price] then you might want to consider it.P.S. Your Kamehameha wave goes half way across the screen anddisappears!"
1,"bad game, just plan bad","I love DBZ as much as any other Anime fan but this game just [stinks]. I'll admit the graphics are good looking and it is cool to play through the world of DBZ, But that is where it ends. If you look deeper into the game you will see that it has multiple flaws. First off, it doesn't follow the story of DBZ exactly so if you are looking for that then don't play.( Since when does King Kai teach Goku Kamehameha.). Second, the hit detection in it is horrible. I have taken multiple cheap shots, and the punching and energy blasts rarely hit. You can beat the game by merely using 2 moves over and over again. The fun factor quickly wears off and all your left with is a semi-acceptable action/adventure/rpg game. Buy only if you are a hardcore DBZ fan."
1,Boo!!,"This game was way to short. It does fallow the story pritty well, but you only learn three energy moves. All the bad guys sometimes just sit their in the middle of fighting and you can hit them as much as you want. You can only punch, youi can't kick. You never actually train exept for at king kie's. Don't buy this game, it's not worth it even if you love DBZ."
2,This game sucked...,"As a DBZ fan it pains me to say it but this game [disappointed]...at first I was really enjoying it but then it began to get painfully slow...chunks are skipped in it, the saiyan saga for instance involving Vegeta and Nappa was far too short, and most areas seemed to repeat, this game is short and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wanted something worth-while, this is a bad investiment for your hard earned cash, but if you do buy it keep the receipt, it's so short that you CAN and probablly will complete it within one day, two at the most...lets hope the other's in this series (when they're released) are ALOT better..."
5,The Best Game For Game Boy Advance is The Legacy of Goku,The Legacy of Goku is the best game for Game Boy Advance.You can hold your Kamehameha wave and fire a strong one at your enemies.Even though you die in the game it is still cool.
4,I WANT MY DONUT BACK!!!!!!!,okay first of all this game is horribly bad its a good thing i didn't waste my money on such crap.the way i got this game was ... a few weeks ago i traded my freind a crispy cream donut (i'm not not kidding!) for this game i brought it home the first 2and-a-half days it was all i could play but then i destroyed the purple dude at the end and beat it!!?? allthough i am glad the purple dude destroyed the bald toddler guy (he's annoying!) days had passed by and i was still denying i traded good but in the end this game was sold for 65cents at my garage sale the reason i gave it ONE star was at least the bald dude gets destroyed. here are the ganme grades SOUND:D+ GRAPHICS:D- GAMEPLAY:F PLOT:F- CHARECTERS: C overall grade D- P.S. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great Game....SIKE!!!,this game is not the best dragonball z game that you would play. the game is wicked short and it is so easy to beat the masters of each level. for people who are crazy about dragonball z then this game might be for you but for the other this is a really bad game. the reason i gave it 2 stars is because how the game looks. the sagas are short but they give you all the information about them. in the saiyan saga you have to fight Radzitz by yourself! other then what I just wrote this game is a looks good but plays ugly kind of game.
1,DragonballZ:Legacy of Goku,do not get this game it is boring too short. I beat the game in a half a hour the second time i played it.
4,This game is good but short,This game rocks. IT pretty much follows the first three saga's of DBZ. You start out weak but you can get much stronger. To get invincibility you have to fight a enemy that can fire a ki attack. When he's charging up press R to fly and stay still and let the beam hit you. Go up to the enemy and keep on punching. If you press R again you will get out of invincibility. A is to punch. Don't press B in invincibility mode. B is to fire ki. Hope this review was helpful.
4,Great game to short!!!,"DBZ The Legacy of Goku is one of the best RPG's I've ever seen. An RPG is kind of like pokemon. You start out on master roshi's island (your old time master in martial arts) for a reunion with your childhood friends. shortly after that your brother raditz comes and the story goes on from their. Now the down points of the game. The game is very very short and easy. I beat this game within 6 hours. It is not so very accurate to the original show. Examples are that you learn the Kamahamaha from king Kai. That is not true because in the real show goku learns it from his grandpa gohan. Another is when you are on snake way you start losing balance and fall off for not apparente reason. Besides that the game has great graphics, nice gameplay, and awesome cut scenes from the show. I recomend this game to all DBZ lovers"
3,It's OK,"I love DBZ so after I Bought this game I just had to wright a review to.For all of you DBZ fans, this game does NOT follow the storyline at ALL, never in all the episodes that I have watched did I hear of King Ki teaching Goku his signiture trick the ""Kamahamaha"" wave. The all around graphics are okay but I personally think that the makers could have done better. Another downside is that you can only move in 4 directions, up, down, left, and right. The fact that the only player you can control is Goku is a big letdown, I had hoped that I would be able to play with Gohan, Piccolo, and so forth, but then again the game is called ""Legacy of Goku."" Anyway I am a Dragon Ball Z fanatic so I just had to buy this game."
3,SUPER SAYIAN OR NOT?,This game is good i loved it.Its not like other rpgs.You can only go up to level 25.When u finally fight feiza u turn super sayian and not know what it is.When u fight a boss i used the same stragey.All i did was fly around and shoot ki blasts.And just between u and me the flying system sucks.The game took me hours to beat.2 of the energy attaks are useless.But it is real fun to play.If u get mad asily than dont buy it. ....
3,Dragonball legacy of goku,"Good you can only use Goku, but good you start as Goku. You end it at the freza saga you can fly shoot energy attacks it's a real fun game. You learn the kamehameha you learn solar flaer it blindsenemys then all you have to do is is kameha to win. You also go supersaiyn at the end it doesn't tell the story excally though, but I suggest number 2 it's way better!!!!!!!!!! but this is cheaper I hope a number 3 comes out though Dragonball z supersonic warriors is better than 1 and 2 dragonball z taikestu don't get it a waist of money trust me it will make you hate dragonball z games for ever!!!!!!!! It's really your desicion though."
3,Should of been better,This game is fun and all it has all teh characters in it but the story went by wayyyyyyy too fast and the game was only 3 to 4 HOURS LONG. i beat it in 2 days and i take my time on these but its still a fun game its just too short and quick!
5,Short but great,"This long awaited DBZ game is great. I love it. Its short but it was still exciting. It was even betta than the show itself. you start out at level 1 but train hard and you'll be at level 25 the most powerfulest you can get.This game is a must have for DBZ fans. You get to defeat Raditz and vegeta and all those losers, and train under king kai himself. But hwy didn't they include the spirit bomb as one of goku's attacks. that sucked, but it didn't change the game in any way."
2,Rent Don't Buy,It took me only 2 days to beat this game. And on top of that the game ends right after goku beats Frizea on Namek. That's it. It's just not worth the cost of the game.
5,Legacy of Goku is cool!,"I played this game once.The story begins on Master Roshi's Island finding his magazines, then Raditz comes and takes Gohan.Then, you travel through a forest into a small town.A wiseman tells you there are disturbances in the town.After that you go face Raditz.Then comes Snake Way and HFIL(home for infinite losers).Then to King Kai's Planet.Then more tasks then Nappa and Vegeta.Then Namek then Freiza."
3,They can do better,This game was good but they can do better. It was too easy. I beat it in an hour and a half. I've beaten all of the DB/DBZ/GT Games out to the public. And this one is too easy. The battling system sucks. Beating the bosses is easy. All you have to do is fly when they fire a energy blast and get hit by it and kill them. Easy. Get this game if you need. Or download it off some site. pssssssst download it. Vozz out.
1,WHAT HAPPENED HERE,What ever you do don't buy this game. The story line is very inaccurate and the game is boring and short. It took me about 4 hours to beat this game completely. I am a hardcore DBZ fan and I own all the PS games and this is by far the worst. This is a pretty bad start for Infogrames Entertainment.
2,above 6 don't buy,"Im a hardcore gamer. I love dbz but unless your 6 don't buy it.It is simple I'm eleven and I beat it in an hour.This game simply is not even worth ten $$ but I payed thirty. let me summarize the game 45 minutes. if you want to spend thiry $ on agood game buy super mario, or Golden sun even starwars is better than this"
3,"Well, It's good, but I expected a little better...","Well, I have had this game for a while and beaten it many times. I am a big DBZ fan, so when this game came out I bought it as soon as I could. The only problem was I had beaten it the next day. Now, that might be understandable if I had been playing non-stop, but I beat it in about 5-6 hours.I is a good game, good music, game play, graphics, good villains, and I love when Goku goes SSJ at the end. But I don't reccomend that you buy it. Rent it! you will beat it before you return it. I guarentee it. Don't waste the monet on buying it(unless you want to beat it over and over again)."
2,OK,"This game was ok but u mostly spend time killing snakes,wolves,dinos. Also u get exp by talking and killing which takes lots of time, another is u have a limit to fly. The graphics r good but the game is short I beat it in hours. But it is OK."
5,sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this game a while ago and its really good. I think I almost beat it. People who say they beat it in a few hours or even days are either lying or REALLY GOOD. l is change through ki blast, solar flare and kamehameha beams. r is fly (you get more fly time the more levels you grow.) a is punch. b is use enrgy attacks. 25 is the highest level you can grow to. dont worry, you start with 6 fly (wich is really short) but end on level 25 with 99 fly (wich is super long.) you might wanna look at cheatplanet.com for cheats for this game.PS. please tell me how to get through the church in Namek."
2,Its OK,"I'm a true DBZ fan but this games is a true discrace!Besides the fact that it only has one third the series on it,it waaaaaay to easy!!!! To tell the truth I must say that Ireccomend it to no one..."
2,I agree,"I think this game does not live up to the show. The only goodpart of the game is the cartoon at the begining.(which takes up40% of the space on the game cartrige) But I have to say eventhough the cartoon is impressive to see on the GBA, it's notworth buying the game."
3,haven't played it yet but from wat i have herd!,"i have herd that this game was ok and very awsome and boring, there definatley needs to be a sequal if anything. i herd he only is super sai-jin for a the end of the game which could get boring. A prequal would be nice to have the cell saga and the Majin(thats how it is spelled)Buu saga."
2,the worst dragonball z game ever,... it is practicly an adventure game i don't know where they got rpg because i'm a big fan of both the hardest part was practicly turning on the game it self ( i'm acustom to it being on top) and after a while it gets pretty boring and what's with goku not being able to beat up one wolf in dragonball he beats up an entire pack and now he can barily take on one and the freiza saga goku dosn't fight freiza in is first form he fights him in his last which is ok but not if there trying to stay true to the story and what hapend to the half way point now you just fight a really hungry lady ( i forgot her name) instead of jurning threw the castle.
4,DBZ disappointment,"When I first saw this game in a store I thought it was so cool that their was finally a DBZ game for GBA. This turned out to be a major disappointment. In the beginning you are really weak and are easily killed by wild animals. In the show, Goku is making fools out of giants before he is 13. Also, I don't know why they made it so short. I beat it in less than a week, even though I didn't play very much. You don't learn many moves and you learn them in the wrong order, in incorrect places. The only good thing is the graphics and the storyline. Overall, if you aren't a picky gamer, and don't mind something short, you might like this game."
2,DBZ: Legacy Of Goku,"This game is horrible. For one thing, it's short, about 3 hours, and it's virtually impossible to beat without cheating. They should have a game that goes through yhe entire life of Goku, not in the middle of his life. If you want to buy this game to see how it is, go ahead, but it's a waste of [money]."
5,goku,itas a great game but i cant get the third artifact and thats the only hard part. otherwise its a great game.
1,booooooooo,Im a dbz fan. but this game stinks. vegeta is harder than freeza. is that possible!! I hate it. don't buy it. i beat it in like 2 min and its to easy. dont buy it. even dbz fans. its cool at the beggining but the end is boring. u reach top level for goku half way through...
2,Not the best game ever,"Being a huge Dragon Ball Z fan, I was very excited about the release of this game, but I have to admit that I was a more than a little disappionted with the game. Most of the flaws have probably already been pionted out to you, such as the fact that a dog can [beat] Goku...at the beginning of the game. Also, the flight and energy attack system just didn't serve the game justice. The fighting system, which mainly consisted of you punching your opponent, flying away, then punching him again, just didn't seem to sastisfy my desire to play as someone who could punch through a mountain. Also, it would of been nice to play as someone besides Goku. The game wasn't all flaws, though. I did enjoy the nice graphics and true-to-the-anime story. All in all, this is a game that should be owned by all hard core DBZ fans(although they'll probably hate it the most) and younger gamers. And it did pave the way for future American Dragon Ball Z games."
2,"A good game, but with ALOT of problems","I'm a DBZ fanatic. I watch the show a lot and I was really excited when I first found out that there was going to be a DBZ game. But I never thought it would be so SHORT! I mean, they could have at least put in more of the DBZ plot. I finished this game in 5 in a half hours. That had to have been the shortest game I have ever played. For one thing, Goku should have already known the kamehameha wave. He didn't learn it from king kai, he learned it as a child from master Roshi. Also the enemy AI is so stupid! I mean a lot of times they would lose track of me even when I was right in front of them! I could tell you a bunch of other problems but the bottom line is DON'T BUY IT!! Renting it would be a much smarter desicion."
4,I can't get it away from my daughter,"I bought a Game Boy Advance a month after I bought this game, but my 12-yr-old plays DBZ non-stop so I can't try it. It has to be good. She was stuck in the Namek temple for a time, but she tends to short-cut as much as possible which she found out not to do after I found a zine with cheats in it. Chibi Vegeta looks sooo cool--too bad one can't play as The Prince(grrr.) Looks like it will be loads of fun(once I find a new game to distract her with so I can play it.) She orders things about(tells things to get away from her) so I have a clue to what's going on (the wolves are tough until one learns how to beat them). It seems to follow the show so no big mystery beyond what gets cut to fit the story into the game timeline."
2,Big Fans Only,"If you're a hardcore DBZ fan, egt the game because it has a great plotline, but otherwise, don't. It's extremly easy, you'll beat it in mere hours, and gameplay is too easy."
2,Can you even call this a game???,First off this game is way way to short!! Also the controls were to sloopy. Lastly it skiped to many important things and you can only be Goku. I give this game one thumb........ DOWN!!
1,ME LIKE PIE!!!!,LEGECY OF GUKO SUXORZ BOXORZ BIG TIME! IT TAKEZ ME 4 EVAR TO LEVAL UP AND WEN I DID THEH GAME BOY SP BLEW UP AN I GOT BURNT! MY MUM TAKEZ ME TO TEH HOSPITOL AND TEH DOCTOR THREW PIE AT ME! HE SAID EAT PIE!!!!! THE END!!!!!!!
1,"The reason DBZ is considered a ""little kid thing""","Dbz started as a comic book series in japan that got made into a show. Both were aimed at 12-18 year olds. Seeing it's sucseess a company called funimaton poorly translated it and cut out lots of stuff so it's now for 6-11 year olds and has lotls of horrible mechandice. This is one the poor money making schemes. I love the rich plot of DBZ. This has very few refrences to the plot. The fighting engine is simply unacseptable. Physical combat always kills you and chi combat takes Fooooorrrreeevvvver. The bosses always make you want to cremate this game. The side quest have nothing to with DBZ, but are the only mildly enertaining feature."
3,game was too easy:need to make much better,"if you like dbz, this game will be a synch. Although it was fun for the first couple of times i played it, it is now starting ot get a bit boring. Infogrames,if you are reading this, lwt me just say that you need some better ideas. I believe that you should base it more on a game like the legend of the super saiyan for SNES; now there is a fun game. hopefully, in the future, infogrames will make a fighting game like smash brothers. If possible, maybe they could make it like the legend of the super saiyan. Doubt it though."
5,i think this game is going to be cool!,"i cant wait till i get this game ive been waiting for it for a while,its in the mail,it seems like a prettey awsome game the way ive heard of it so,im hoping it will,i think if their are any other DBZ fans which i am,im a very big fan of the show.i would probaly give 5 stars for this game ive seen snapshots it seems to have very good graphics for a gba,and i think it will have a good storyline,what ive heard is that it is the best game for gba,i cant wait till it here cya!"
1,I HATE THIS GAME!!!,i'm the biggest Dragonball Z fan ever. i was so disappointed in this game don't buy this
1,Dragon ball Z Sucks,"If u don't have this game yet,then don't even think about buying this game.y?Well iT VERY SHORT and when u charge up ur kamehame it won't go very far.Plus that has 3 different king of blast.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
1,THIS GAME [is bad],"The reason i say this is because the game lacks everything that is supposed to make a game good. I like dragonball....don't get me wrong, but this game had some horrible glitches that made the game just impossibly EASY!, and it just went by way too quickly. I heard reviews for it saying that the world was just huge and it's an epic adventure game, but that's just bull. The world is small, and you go by every place so damn quickly. The whole game just sucks...i suggest playing the game if you're a dragonball fan and seeing hopefully what i am talking about."
1,DON'T BUY THIS HORRIBLE GAME,This game is terrible. It is not worth buying. The cpu does the fighting for you the caracters are bloches on the screen and the music and sound effects are horrible! Don't buy this peice of junk!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,I find even the most boring games better than this,"It's really an OKAY game. I'd actually find fun in killing the animals in the game, but they usually keep killing me. I've already died like, 5 times without even getting to Raditz yet. Keep your money peoplz... you'll prolly need it on a better game, such as Pokemon Advance. It's not really worth getting. HP is low, flying can't be used a lot, attacks are weak, the enemies are usually way stronger than you easily getting you killed... and you don't know when they will attack. I found a better DBZ game that I downloaded which is almost like this, but MUCH BETTER. The only good things about this is the clips from the show and movies... and it's challenging, though I find Pokemon more challenging and stratigic than this."
