4,Amazing,"It was an overall good movie. It was very entertaining, and in my opinion a great heist thriller. Not good for kids with strict parents. F-bomb was dropped almost every other second."
3,Very intense and VERY good!!!,"Clive Owen plays a bank robber, and i think he is a brilliant one. He got his hostages, about 30 or so, to strip down to their underwear and put on the same costumes as the robbers, so that when the people are set free, the police think they're the robbers and arrest them. Clive Owen's character wanted the money to buy a plane. ..."
2,The first 45 minutes are gripping. Then it goes down hill quickly. The ending is outrageously illogical.,The first 45 minutes are gripping. Then it goes down hill quickly. The ending is outrageously illogical.Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster can't save the film.It's worth renting for curiousity.
5,Good Movie,"THis is a good movie, it kept my interest throughout the entire movie. Its very interesting how these robbers try to pull off the perfect robbery. The acting was superb. I highly recommend this movie. Clive Owen and Denzel Washington was excellent in this movie."
3,Why Spike Lee?,"After viewing this film it was obvious that Spike Lee was the director as it dragged along and extended to the brink of boring, Spike`s artistic signature. He also never misses a chance to tediously focus on racism issues predominately produced by his white characters. However, in this film he inadequately described and almost missed the racist atrocities that were the reasons behind this bank robbery and main plot of the story. For the viewers that haven't seen this film yet, I won't elaborate. With such an outstanding cast, great story and entertaining premise why was Spike Lee selected to do this film? Denzel Washington is a great and gifted actor, but his loyalty to this overrated director by continuously appearing in his films is frustrating. The actors alone in this film make it a worthwhile two hours but I wish I didn't buy it."
2,"Waste of many talents, except the lack of Washington's","Well, this movie is way too laid back to be real for a bank robbery movie. It's a stupid movie, that's what I'll call it. Washington's performaance is typical of his tyle, like God's speaking to the mass, his sure style just makes everything feel fake and too much acting. The plot is barely Ok. The cop Washington played is just a dumb 3rd grade cop, with more wild guess from nowhere than intelligence. The scene where he walked into Mr. Case's office and accused him lying is just very odd because he has nothing about what happened and why money isn't stolen. And, a small-time cop just walk into a big bank head's office and accuse him lying, just because he hasn't seen money not stolen during a bank robbery before?! Come on, it's cheap and dumb. 2 stars at most. It is worse with Washington's typical over-acting."
3,"Superb story, poor camera work, some terrible hamming","I would rate the plot five stars: it is clever, it is logical, and it has its twists and turns. The script is also excellent, with sharp dialogue and some wit.On the negative side: First there is the terrible camera work, with the camera unsteady most of the time, and violently shaking during the scene when the police enter the bank.Secondly, there is the hamming of the actress representing Ms White. Her gratuitous cockiness and nastiness and threats make me sick whenever she appears.The same is true, though to a lessor extent, of the gloating of Detective Frazier. (Incidentally, what did he do with the diamond? Did he pocket it?)"
5,Excellent,"Seen it more than. Excellent! Will see it many more times. Never gets tired. Buy it. Those who berate it, don't get it."
4,Great Movie!,"Inside Man is a great movie. Fast action, great acting, fantastic plot. I highly recommend this movie."
4,Intriguing,"This is a very good variation on the classic heist movie. A top quality cast all give fine performances, resulting in an entertaining and intelligent film. This second quality is important, since we've all seen heist movies before, but this one adds something extra to proceedings by making the owner of the bank (the as always excellent Christopher Plummer) a leading player in film for reasons that only become obvious in the 2nd half of the film.This is more mainstream, than most Spike Lee films but he still stamps his own vision on the film. We should also be grateful that Spike realises the futility of buildings and cars exploding. Perhaps hollywood will learn one day. It goes without saying that the direction is good and the script equally so. Denzel Washington shares the acting honours with Plummer, if only because Clive Owen is behind a mask most of the time.I have only seen the film once, but can imagine that it will improve with a few more viewings. Recommended."
4,A Very Solid Movie With Great Acting,"Denzel Washington is really, really good in this film. It is one of his best performances in a long while. Clive Owen is good as usual and Jodie Foster makes the most out of her small role. Inside Man also boasts a clever story with realistic dialogue (you won't get any Tarantino lines here), some of which had the theater laughing in a good way. The twist was unique, but it wasn't that mind blowing. I don't regret spending $7.00 and two and a half hours of my day on this film. This is one of the few Spike Lee films that I enjoyed from beginning to end."
2,just ok,"Denzel Washington is One of my all time Favorite Actors. Jodei Foster is one my all time Favorite Actresses,but they are both wasted on this overblown film. back in the day Spike Lee was happening,but it's been so long since he has made a film that has truly held my full attention. I dig the aingle where he is coming from with this picture,but something is missing in this film that keeps it from reaching it's peak. you get a Post 9/11 flavor with a few other past films of this style thrown in. it should have been more tighter."
4,dA inside to INSIDE MAN,"pLOT:Russell (Clive Owen)is a bank robber who has planned the perfect heist....Frazier (Denzel Washington) is a hostage negotiator whose mission is to manage the situation.... But as the tale of a step by step bank robbery plays out, Frazier realises this ain't your usual bank robbery, and he begins to take measures to save the hostages of in the bank. Add to the mix, Madeline White (Jodie Foster), whose a attonery whose client's very important document is locked inside a deposit box who does really have Frazier's job a simple walk in the park...2 Oscar winners, 1 Oscar nominee, Spike lee(awesome director in his element here!!!) an engaging storyline and a wonderful soundtrack to boot, this makes for an engaging and entertaining way to spend your day....dVD dETAILS-an audio commentary with director Spike Lee, deleted scenes, a Making of Inside Man featurette, and a Number 4 featurette, presented in 2.35.1 aspect ratio..."
2,Not one of Denzel Washington's Better Films,"I really could not take anything out of this movie. The middle of the film was quite suspenseful but the ending was strange I thought, almost like there was going to be a part 2. Think I had seen that somewhere that there was going to be a part 2. A better ending could have changed my opinion since I feel an ending came make or break a movie. For the casual D. Washington, fan look at training day or john q instead.Peter J. Miller"
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The movie runs a little bit too long, has no real purpose for Jodie Foster, and tries to pass off Christopher Plummer's character as someone who had influence during the Holocaust (assuming he was 35 in 1945, which is still a bit young to be running a bank, that makes him 96 in 2006), but avoids many of the pratfalls of similar heist movies and emerges as a watchable thriller."
1,Just plain awful!,"This is an attempt at sophistication that just doesn't hack it. Jodie Foster's character, for one example, is so pretentious and obnoxious that one is tempted to reach into the screen and slap her face.The language that everyone uses, particularly the Mayor, is so full of obscenities that it is just not credible. Filthy language for the sake of filthy language is just filthy.The story, where Denzel Washington's character appears to finally understand what is going on with the bank robbers, is just too obscure and nonsensical for anyone to figure out, even Denzel Washington.If there is some kind of message her, like criminals will finally be found out and will receive justice, it is lost in the juvenile way in which this movie is presented. Just plain awful."
3,Lee's best movie,"It seems that Spike has grown up and is finally just making smart movies. This heist movie is compelling and well played primarily because an interesting story is supported by interesting characters. Lee has always put together an interesting visual product and he's finally made a movie that's not pedantic. Learn as little as you can before watching to keep it fresh. I won't purchase this or add to my Top 100, but this is as good as Topkapi."
3,Good Movie,"This is one of those movies that are worth seeing or worth renting because of the good direction and good acting, and there are some twists to the movie, although the twists aren't exactly Earth shattering. At the end of the movie, i was glad I saw it, but forgot about it the next day, until I decided to write this review. One thing that did stand out, though is that there was some cool camera angles and Spike Lee did get vent some of his social comments (I liked the one about the video game, the one about the Arabs was pointless, in this Hermit Crab's humble opinion), although he didn't beat us over the head with them. Definitely worth watching, maybe even full price if you can afford $20.00, or whatever the full price may be, as I'd actually give it 3.5 stars if I could. Peace be with you always!"
3,plot?,"Denzel is great as usual. Entertaining. But the plot is weak and full of holes. I guess that is artistic license, but keeps it at just a 'pretty good' movie. I was disappointed, especially after all the rave reviews."
3,A standard movie.... hence 3 stars.,"Im not saying that this movie was bad. The dynamics of the movie were well balanced, and the story for the most part engaging. The characters were sharp and the actors looked very comfortable. But I didnt walk away from this movie with too much of an after thought. It was a good movie when I was there, and now I dont remember much. A safe movie.Hence the 3 stars.Just one last note. I wonder about Denzel Washington. He seems to draw the same character out of every role he is given. His expressions, his personality, his tone is always the same."
3,Too many things at the same time,"With Inside Man Spike Lee certainly managed to disguise a regular bankjob story as a flashy accelerating action movie.Nevertheless the result he came up with is still worth watching.The New York police has trapped a small group of bankrobbers led by Clive Owen inside the bank they were trying to rob. Denzel Washington is in charge of the police squad sieging the bank. As time passes by he begins to realize, that the robbers aren't the type of criminals they pretend to be. Spike Lee is still a great director, but Inside Man clearly tries to be too many things at the same time. There a too many subplots in there , that could have easily been removed from the final cut. Shame though...because the cast is great...even Jodie Foster is fun to watch for a change. Normally she tends to play women that could burst out crying at any time.(SARR)"
4,Clever,This movie's been out for a while. If you haven't seen it and like a good bank/hostage/mystery kind of movie then you should definitely check it out.
3,Decent flick but was hoping for more,"Average. It was good, but was hoping for more from Spike Lee and Denzel. Plot was good, but it sort of dragged at times."
3,Here........I..........am!,"Ho hum, Denzel. Plot's okay but convoluted since it follows Hollywood's formulaic ending, to make protagonist the champion when he's just a New York cop doing his job. Breaking up a bank CEO's longtime connection to Nazi treasure? Again? Cut maybe a dozen scenes, added text for clarification would have accelerated the plot and garnered higher praise. Thinly portrayed is Washington's love interest, and he just doesn't have a foil (not Jody Foster although I liked her character) to propel his actions and words. Suspend lots of disbelief, doesn't have the ring of verisimilitude aka plausibility. In fact, Washington's acting persona puts one in mind that the man is thinking about his dinner date or next holiday in Cannes. Of course, if you're a fan, he can do no wrong. Can't hold a candle to Philadelphia story or the other subway flick in which he starred."
2,More of the same,I found it kind of ironic that in Inside Man the characters speak of Dog Day Afternoon. Basicly they are the same movie. Some guys hold up a bank and you have an all day stand-off. It's the same movie that we've seen a million times. And can Denzel Washington ever play a part that doesn't involve being a cop or an authority figure? This movie adds absolutely nothing to the crime genre. You'd be better off just watching something else.
4,Inside Man,"i enjoyed the movie except for the ""f"" word being used so many times. The movie was interesting and at least not ""action packed"" with violence in every scene."
3,Perfectly adequate entertainment,"All the criticisms of the film made by others are quite valid. I still think the film holds up well on several fronts.1 -- The robber-in-chief is brighter and more idiosyncratic than the typical thriller villain.2 -- Jodie Foster's character, with her edgy qualities, is a real departure and a welcome change for this talented actress (even if the script leaves her a bit ineffective).3 -- The hostage situation is so unusual it keeps the viewer guessing as to what could possibly be going on.This may not make the AFI Top 100 Films of all time but it is a perfectly good DVD to rent for a Friday night at home. It's a rare B movie that I would actually happily watch twice."
5,Must Have for your collection,"Great smelling fragrance. Perfect for the younger man with a mature attitude. Burberry Brit creates a modern twist on a more classic scent. It is light enough to wear at the office, but I would stick to more formal events/outings and evening wear with this one unless you have a fairly formal office setting. There are other scents that are more appropriate IMO for the most formal occasions. Definitely one for my rotation. I currently have Ed Hardy, Lacoste Essential, Tommy Bahama(Signature,Very Cool, and Set Sail South Seas), Burberry, Weekend by Burberry. I also have Armani Code and Aqua Di Gio but I have stopped wearing them as they have become much too popular for my taste."
1,PICTURE MISLEADING - NO TOILETRY BAG INCLUDED!,"I bought this as a gift for my husband -- we both love this fragrance. However, I was extremely disappointed to discover that this particular purchase DID NOT include the toiletry bag as is pictured. There are multiple vendors that sell Burberry Brit on Amazon -- some with the toiletry bag and some without. I chose to buy this fragrance from this particular vendor BECAUSE the bag was included with the purchase, and the purchase was a gift. There's no reason they can't use an image of the product without the toiletry bag included -- other vendors do. It's very misleading."
4,Heart of a Champion,I give this book two thumbs up! It was full of surprises and unbelievably excellent. It made me keep wanting to turn the page. This is a great book for kids growing up who like baseball. It has a great plot and is well written. Deuker uses interesting and appealing adjectives that describe the book well. He tells about the characters very well and gives a good description of each one. He puts a visible picture in your head of what the character looks like. Deuker writes a must read and anyone who is a serious book reader must pick this novel up right away and read it. You will be amazed!
4,Good stuff,"i really liked this book because it teaches very good morals, which kids these days really need. You might be thinking what morals, well such as if you drink and drive you could get hert, or if you work hard at something that you will always come out on top. i would recomend anyone who gets a chanse to read this book."
4,Heart of A Champion,Heart of a Champion is about two kids one jimmy is a naturly talented baseball player and the other seth is strugiling to be good enough for the varsity team but when he finaly makes it tragedy strikes. This book was very well written has a lot of action drama and tragity this book will makes you think about taking life for ganted. I would Reconend this to anyone girl or boy.
5,One of the Greatest books I have read,"This was a great book. it wasn't just about baseball, it was about teens dealing with peer preasure and teenage problems. the problems that seth and jimmy had, affected the way they played on the ball diamond, but together they got through it. this was one of those books where you just can't get enough, and it is hard to put down. i read this in one sitting, and was excited the whole way through. if you like reading about baseball, then this is a book for you, and you like a fairly easy read, you will enjoy this book. if you enjoy reading this book, then i siggest you read the rest of Karl Deukers books, which include on the devils court, painting the black, and one other."
4,review,"TO:Seth baseball is the most important thing in the world, until his best friend gets caught up in drinking. In Heart of a Champion, Seth learns a valuable lesson. It mostly takes place on a baseball field but there are other places too. Not only does Seth learn a valuable lesson but his best friend Jimmy learns one two. The book by Carl Deuker called Heart of a Champion is a very good book."
5,Heart Of A Champion,"This book was amazing! This boy named Seth loves baseball. He and his friend Jimmy played it almost everyday, even in the winter, in his garage. They are the best players in the town. It takes place about 30 years ago. When kids sometimes got ahold of drugs. The way the author describes it is in a safe way so anyone can read it. If you are someone who loves baseball or like a good rolling book,sometimes some high lights this is a good book for ypu."
4,Another Deuker gem!,"Seth Barham could basically be described as you everyday average kid. He is struggling to find his identity after losing his father, then he meets Jimmy Winters. Jimmy teaches Seth about baseball, and Seth falls in love with the game. As usual Deukers game descriptions are second to none, and the book deals with so many issues other than just baseball. Just like in life the outcome may not be what you expect. A must read for any kid 13 and up, I enjoyed the book and Im 28. Deuker does it again!"
5,This book is SO good.,"I read this book b/c my son picked it for his 8th grade summer reading. I devoured it, even thought It's slow. My son says ""boring,"" but it's far from boring. The author is masterfully setting the stage and bringing you in w/ everyday happenings of the lives of young boys who play baseball. I mean, you can just picture these boys and their connection through the simple (not simple-minded) dialogue they have. I was in tears at the end of the book. This author is a freakin' genious the way he sets the stage and the local color and has a few exceptionally profound statements, said in a kids voice. This book is soulful and needs to be a must read in schools. Especially since kids today must read things like Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery."""
5,baseball,I used to hate baseball. but after reading this very very good book. sharted liking baseball and books like this. love this book.
3,A Good Baseball book for Middle School Students,"This is a youth book about two boys' love for baseball. One is extremely talented on the baseball field while the other is better than average. They support each other in many ways. The author outlines their home lives along with the problems that many families may have.One boy's father is an alcoholic while the other's had died many years earlier. They are challenged with typical problems facing teenagers, such as drugs and alcohol, academics in school, and dedication to the sport of which they love. Will they or won't they win the state championship?This would be an interesting book for 10-15 year old boys. It's also a fun book for adults!"
5,Heart of a Reviewer,"A little kid named Seth was hanging out at a park all by himself. Then he met Jimmy, a boy who changed his life. Jimmy got Seth into baseball and they played with eachother until high school. You will stay addicted to this books from all the suspenseful twists and turns. I think this is a good book because it's about an athlete who is very determined and builds up his skills. He goes through the obstacles of life and friendships. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sports."
5,Tiny and exquisite,"Gerda Bengtsson is Denmark's greatest fiber-artist and created more than 1000 designs. She achieves the essence of botanicals using just a few, well-placed stitches. Most of her botanicals are large, stunning pieces. This is a collection of tiny, exquisite plants. (No, you won't find anything cute in here; no teddybears or santas).Over the past thirty years, I have made many of these, framed them for my home or given them as gifts. They are best when stitched on pure linen with Danish Flower Thread. [Still available from the Haandarbejdets Fremme]I was delighted to see this gem of a book for sale and bought up 5 copies! Mine is so worn!"
5,"CHARMING, PETITE DESIGNS","This book has the most CHARMING small florals which would be delightful in a European or ""cottage"" decor! I'm going to make some sachet pouches with these designs on them to place throughout my home or give as gifts. They add a delightful touch to any small project.I thought the suggestion to enlarge the charts on a copier was a good idea. To make the charts even easier to follow, and more interesting to look at, I would suggest coloring the enlarged charts in with colored pencils that resemble the floss colors.I see that DMC has come out with ""linen"" floss in soft floral colors . . . I bet they would produce an especially lovely effect. I saw them at A.C. Moore in the cross stitch section. I do not know how these ""linen"" floss colors are numbered, but I suppose this could be checked out at a DMC website?"
3,danish floral charted designs,This book is a good book for the cross stitcher or the emboidery it is wonderful.
5,The most gorgeous aircraft graces the sky once again,"I bought this book as I am a modeller, it sure was a good investment! It has great photos of the actual restoration process as well as a brief history of where these fabulous fighter came from. It also goes into great depth on the history on the spitfire and the differences between the different Mk's. So if you think your just a little bit interested, get this book and it will take the little out!"
3,Lightweight Elephant Comedy/Drama,"The meat is thin on this family friendly movie, but it does provide clean, circus fun and a cute elephant.A teenage ballerina runs off and joins the circus to be with her beloved elephant. There she makes friends and a few foes as she gets to perform and work at rescuing her animal.The storyline is basic and thin, and one that might not hold child and ,definitely not, adults, interest for long except for the cute animals. The actors are ok; there is a small circus setting with animals including a black panther and, of course, Sheila, the endearing elephant.No language, sex, only mild peril, a few dramatic parts, some bouncy music and a touch of young romance. I don't dislike it, but wouldn't watch again."
5,William Messner-Loebs Does It Again,"This book is the conclusion piece to Wonder Woman: The Contest. If you enjoyed that great book, you are sure to enjoy this one as well. It immediately follows The Contest as we see the further adventures of Diana and Artemis in Patriarch's World as Artemis comes to understand exactly what it means to become a 'Wonder Woman'. This book if filled with emotionally charged moments and a large cast of interesting characters. Don't worry though, Messner-Loebs has a great way of weaving in characters into his stories without leaving the reader at a loss of who is who. Mike Deodato Jr. does an outstanding job as well depicting both beautiful characters and realistic expressions. I urge all Wonder Woman fans (and those not) to purchase this wonderful book as it shows many of Diana's and Artemis' trials and tribulations, and what it really means to be 'human'."
4,Awesome,"This was a great addition to my WW collection, I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves WW!"
4,Intriguing look at the superheroine we only thought we knew,"If your only exposure to the woman in the red, white and blue Spandex is the endearingly kitchy 70's TV series starring Lynda Carter or any of her series up until artist Mike Deodato's arrival in Volume 2, Issue 89, you're in for a shock--albeit a pleasant one. This is a Wonder Woman that represents the sensibilities of mid-nineties banal pop-culture alongside current feminist thinking: a volumptuous woman who could put Pamela Lee to shame taking on organized crime, family deceits, and the Joker. There's even a nod or two to the complexities of socio-political systems, like the surprising and devastating plight of villages within the Amazon rainforest, and ripped-from-the-headlines issues such as human rights abuses of illegal immigrants. An odd delight in its schizophrenic appeal to lusty teenage boys and purveyers of Wendy Wasserstein plays. Wonder Woman, you're still a wonder. (Or in 90s vernacular: you go girl!"
5,"""The Challenge of Artemis"" - A Wonder Woman Collectors must have","I read Wonder Woman as a kid, since she was at the time the only female heroine girls looked up to, and recently got into collecting all of her books. I searched far and wide to find a copy of ""The Callenge of Artemis"", but Amazon.com was the only site in which I was able to find a dealer to make a purchase. The dealer was great and knew they possessed a diamond in the rough. The cost didin't compare to the enjoyment I received from every minute I sat reading the comic book from cover to cover. Now, it shall always be a part of my nearly completed set, but also my most cherished copy."
4,Ideal husband,"I enjoyed the play, and it was good. It came on time and in great conditions. I look forward to ordering more movies titles in the future."
1,not happy,it's an demo and some of the show was off. but it's was good. but wouldn't rate it at all.
2,Long and Boring... Good Acting though,This movie featured some good actors but the story line was long and drawn out. Some parts of the movie were dry and just too long.
4,good movie,"The movie was good, some of the cast did not fit their roles, but overall is was a good movie."
4,Reality check,"This was a cute little piece, pretty good if you need to feel that cusy, huggy feeling (and sometimes I do). But, it's not realistic. I'm relatively, culturally experienced, and believe me it's a fairy tale."
2,stageplay not a movie,This is a stageplay with a bad laugh track that is very distracting. I recognize the actors and the acting was decent so that is the reason for the 2 stars. I won't go into too much detail so not to share any spoilers.
4,TRACKS,"This is a single with some great songs and only gets 4 stars because only one of the songs is NEW and RARE. Thes rest is like a mini greatest hits. That should be enough for fans of the band to own this Hard to Find single, though. Here are the tracks:1. Please Return It (LP VERSION)2. Sad to Be Aware (PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED)3. Dream All Day (LP VERSION)4. Solar Sister (LP VERSION)5. Suddenly Mary (LP VERSION"
2,Loud background noise (music) ruins an otherwise okay DVD.,"The technical aspects covered and film footage were first rate. However, the whole experience was bad in that the obnoxious background noise (I'm being very charitable here) was so distracting that I couldn't concentrate on what was being said. I'm not kidding! I don't mind a little music intro but this was absurd and had no place or purpose other than to distract from the oral narrative. I know this isn't supposed to be like a conversation in my living room but still, if someone is trying to explain the intricacies of the tires being use in MotoGp then why in the hell do you have to put up with someone who sounds as if he's pounding on a garbage can lid with a baseball bat? This was not an isolated problem. It occurs throughout the DVD. The same criticism applies to the 2007 MotoGP Official Review DVD that I purchased at the same time."
1,Cheap copy of old text enlarged and blurry on white shiny slippery paper,"Horrible blurry poorly copied large print on glaring white shiny paper. Give me an old book with yellowed paper and a magnifying glass over this.I could not return as it is too late, but this will be relegated to the bottom shelf - no coffee table book - worst presentation of a book I've seen since high school text books with cheap slippery paper. Clearly a cheaply made enlarged copy of original text. Difficult to read"
5,From the director of Caligula!,"This is one of my favourite Tinto Brass films, the guy who made Caligula. Features the beautiful Serena Grandi. DVD is looking very good, and is in English, except a few subtitles when they speak Italian. Interesting interview with Tinto Brass as well. Better than todays erotic films."
1,Slow and Boring,"The film was alright, a pleasent enough effort, however, Megan Mullaley is hardly in it and it's not a particulary interesting film. It suffers from a genuine lack of pacing and the actress who played the wife (the ugly woman) was grating and could NOT act at all.Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,Heaps of paper do not make a book,"This is nothing more than a blind reclamation of Siborne and Mercer, It seems that Muir did not have any other sources... or neglected them on purpose. All the Anglo Saxon predudices of the last 2 centuries are blindly repeated over and over again.Muir has created a unreadable heap of paper that, if you are interested in this period, is a book you can absolutely afford to miss. Better buy the original work of Mercer and Siborne, and make your own conclusions."
1,Was Paddy Griffith helping Rory write this book?,"Oh, my goodness, one more book about the nonsense of British superiority. Superiority? Yeah, right, in boasting!Another title such as ""The British Tactics and Experience"" would be more appropriate. The page to page one-sidedness is boring. After reading this book I should be greatly surprised that also the Russians and Austrians were able to defeat Napoleon. This book tries to persuade that winning was possible only by the superior ""British and Company."""
1,Narrow range of sources renders book of little value,"With multiple European archives available, it is regrettable that Mr Muir has chosen to limit his sources and criteria to the extraordinary range that he does. The result is something akin to that found in a British wargaming magazine, rather than a serious historical study as suggested by the title. Missing this book would be a wise decision."
3,"OK, Could be Better.","Ike is very enthusiastic, especially when he turns from the camera and speaks to a tree or bush. Ike likes lists. (Reminds me of ROTC class in college.) Ike says if I want to catch bass, I should read lots of fishing magazines. We learn to buy TOPO maps and draw circles on them. (Was this guy in ROTC?) But the map class was actually useful, because we learn how to track the migration of bass during the seasons. Don't know that it was $20 useful, but I have to say I hadn't thought of that before. Ike tells you how to pack the boat. (More lists, this guy must have been in ROTC). Anyway, Ike's DVD does have information - unlike that Crappie DVD by Visual Films."
2,Ike doesn't deliver,Ike's video was very dissapointing to me. He only covers very basic informantion and not much of that for the price. There are many better and less expensive videos available.Shop around and save money and get more information!
4,Good For General Knoledge,Great for Begginers. It does have the key general issues for Bass Fishing which was very helpful to undestand that it takes a lot more than buy a rod and go fishing. I have not gone fishing yet after viewing the video.
2,Don't waste your money,"This book my be ""approved by the APPA and APAP"", but don't being fooled by these endorsements. The books outline is too basic as are the review question and don't reflect the level of difficulty of the boards. I was also disappointed that the review questions in the book and on the CD are identical. Except, the CD mixes up some of the graphics. What should be radiology pictures for radiology questions turn out to be radiology picture and ECG questions and vice versa(use the questions in the book as a reference they are correct.You are much better served by purchasing ""Physician Assistant Review"" ISBN: 0781742315. It seems to follow Currents ""CDMT"" to a tee, but thankfully leaves out the esoteric information that is too much for a fledging PA anyway."
2,Flawed,"This text is good for simply supplying a study list and a basic outline to fill in with your own review information. But the outline alone is too basic, leaves out important topics, and contains multiple errors, whether they be typo-s, over-simplifications, bad translation of a higher reference, inappropriate verbage or incorrect qualitative statements. And the practice exam CD has just enough errors to be annoying. Material reviewed by medical professionals needs to be accurate. This study guide needs to be paired with a medical reference intended for physicians to make it useful (try Lange's Current)."
3,"Rent, Don't Buy!","This game is fun to play, but if you are an average skilled player or more I would only suggest renting this game for 3-5 days instead of spending $50 on it because it only takes a few days to defeat. Also most of the footage of the movie on the game come from The Two Towers movie or the previews of the Return of the King movie that you can see on the Two Towers DVD special features. I was disappointed because I expected to see footage from the upcoming movie but I had already seen the footage that I did see on the game.So save yourself some money and go rent this game from your local video store and go and decide the fate of Middle Earth."
2,Cool idea but way too hard,"My husband and I LOVED the Lord of the Rings movies, so we couldn't wait to play the game. We wish we'd never heard of it. Both of us find the game much too hard, to the point that the game is irritating, rather than fun. It's neat to be able to be Gandalf or Aragorn or Frodo, but even when playing the most powerful characters, we have to play the same scenario over and over and over and, well, you get the idea. This game could have been awesome, but as it is, my husband and I wish we hadn't bought it. (If you are 10 years old and have really fast little hands, this may not apply to you. :-))"
2,this is the worst game ever made,"this game is good for the first 4 or 5 levels but then it strikes with very hard levels and it is not easy believe me it is not. this game should be rated m for toughness this is so hard this game i cant stand having it and not playing it. dont waist ure money. i have it and i dont even play it, it is like an empty case."
5,IGreat game!,"Unfortunately, I have not yet had the pleasure to play Return of the King but have heard a lot about it. Like the co-op mode where you can play side-by-side with your best friend, and the plentiful characters you can choose from, unlike Two Towers where there are only 3 playable characters. And Frodo wasn't even one of them! In ROTK you can choose from Gimli, Legolas, Aragon, FRODO, Sam, Gandolf, and two others that must be new in the movie. It is a huge step up from TT, which was still ands excellent game (I gave it 4.5 stars) but still lacked something more. With ROTK, you get it all!!!!!!! Now, when it asks you if this review was helpful, please click yes."
3,"Cool, but it could have been better.","DC here. I think this a great game and I like it very much but I still think it could have been better. Anyone who's played The Two Towers or Fellowship of the Ring probably remembers the characters mouth move while speaking and it gave the game a real feel to it. You think they would do the same for this one right? Wrong. I don't understand why they wouldn't take the time to finish that. Oh well. Next, the levels weren't all that challenging except for shelob, she was one of the most challenging bosses I have ever fought. I like challenging video games and this game sorta fails on that. Well, that's my review for this game. I still play it anytime I can and think it's a must have for any LOTR fan. Well, that's a rap."
5,LOTR: Return of the king review,"This game is incredible. The grafics aren't that good, but the story line just like the movie. The best thing about this game(I think) is that you can play as the entire fellowship, unlike The Two Towers. If you were to go to the store and buy any game I would sujest The Return of The King for PS2, XBOX, or Gamecube. I also think its better than the other two LOTR games because it has two player. I would recomend this game to any one who hasn't played it yet."
5,One word:: WOW,"This game has stunning graphics, excellent AI, great multiplayer fun, many unlockable things and characters, and is going to keep you playing for quite some time. This is probably my favorite game right now that I received for Christmas. I'd recommmend it to anyone. You don't need the other games to enjoy this one. I'd recommend this one in a heartbeat. If you have money burning a hole in your pocket, this game will not jip you."
5,LOTR fan or gamer must have,"This is an amazing game. Not only do you get a sneak preview for the movie, but you also get new interactive enviroment to play with(fire-spears, boiling water cauldrons to spill on you enemies etc). It is also two-player which is a huge bonus. You get six more characters than you got in The Two Towers. I got so absorbed in the game that I beat it three times faster than The Two Towers, despite it being much harder and somewhat longer! Buy It!!!!!"
5,Wish I Could Rate This Game Higher!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"CAMERA ANGLES AND GREAPHICS ARE AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! BEST 2 PLAYER GAME EVER! IT ONLY TOOK ME 0.OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO1 SECONDS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH IT. DO NOT, AND I REPEAT DO NOT, HESITATE TO BUY."
3,Average,While this game was little bit better than the first overall it is just average. Even my kids who are big fans of the series were disappointed. The first one completely blows so if you are going to buy one of the games you should get this one. The graphics are really good but it seems like no attension was payed to game play. Somewhat of a downer.
4,Great game but way to fast,"This game overall was very good. The graphics were good and the combat was exciting. I like how you can stab people when they're on the ground it makes it very realistic. The storyline also follows the movie very well for a vidoe game. My one big disappointment was that it took about 3-4 days to beat it and Im not one those people who plays video games 5 hrs a day. It wasn't that it was to easy because I beat on hard a second time. Overall though it was a great game and I highly suggest that you rent this game, buying it is a waste of money."
1,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,"If you like ""The Lord of the Rings"" book and movie-trilogy then you shouldn't play this game. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" has a poorly designed look of Middle-earth and for some reason it doesn't even seem to follow the plot of the movie that well at all."
2,this is the worst game ever,ok the two towers was soooooo much fun the two towers was not to hard and not to easy this game is way to HARD i cant get past the king of the dead this game sucks it is the worts game ever the reasen why i even gave this game a 2 is if this game were eayser i would love it for those gamers that love hardcore games buy it if not a lest rents it you mite like it soo buy the two towers :)
2,online play no longer available!!!,this game no longer supports online play!!! find something else and don't waste your hard-earned bucks!
4,A Crack of Doom is Scary,Yes it is much better than last years The Two Towers game. One sweet difference is to the awesome co-op mode. 9/10
4,spoiler?!?,As far as I know...Return of the King hasn't been released yet...I was thinking would the game spoil the movie for people who played the game before they saw the movie....and is it worth spoiling the movie to play the game...
4,Awesome Game,"I just bought this game a couple of days ago to give to my son for Christmas. My husband and I, however, have already opened it and are addicted. My husband has already beat the game, but once he did, new levels were unlocked. Once you beat the game, you can unlock new characters and use any character you want in levels where you were limited before. You can take Gandalf on levels where you could only take Frodo and Sam on before. The more you play, the more you level up and the more *** you kick. The graphics are awesome and the music is breathtaking. It's not too hard and not too easy and is definitely worth purchasing!!!"
4,The true KING has returned!,"I'm a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings, whether it be the wonderful novels by J.R.R. Tolkien or Peter Jackson's Godly film adaptations. I loved The Two Towers game which came ut last year, but it lacked multiplayer and replay value. The Return of the King completely made TTT like a kids game.1. Better graphics!2. Amazing film footage/cutscenes.3. More playable characters besides Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli like Gandalf, Sam, Frodo.4. Awesome upgrades! Like where Aragorn knocks down his opponent then pulls out his Elven knife Celeborn gave to him. Awesome!!5. Interactive environments! You can throw spears and fire catapults!6. Co-op mode! Play with a friend and kick some orc butt together!All in all a FANTASTIC game and a must have for all LOTR fans."
2,"Sloppy, Annoying Game","I rented this game and thought it was simply awful. Characters are very hard to follow, with fighting scenes often seeming very cluttered. The challenges are tedious...often seems like you're doing the same thing with different characters for the whole game.Rent or buy the Two Towers game, which I think is much better."
4,GREAT GAME!!!!!,"1.great graphics2.amazing co op mode!!!!-finally3.new characters and levels!!4.much longer than TT5.its more challenging, smarter enemies,takes more skill than just mashing buttons-why some people dont like this is unknown but good challenge is always fun!!6.Online play!!7.sweet new moves and combos8.cool scenes from the movie and voices from the actual actors9.Fun even after you have beaten the game-unlock levels and characters10.Killing loads of orcs is always fun!!This game is definately worth your money"
2,this is a fantastic game but,This is the best lotr game yet it has lots of fun and exiting levels and ie is a game you can play with a friend like in co-op the levels are very good taking your characters through the game and when you finish you get rewarded with new and interesting people who arevery fun to play with if you like any of the lotr games i am almost certain youwill like this one go out and buy it.
5,Bought it for The Boys,I bought this for my boys (ages 15 and 12) for Xmas. They love it.I bought it after much review reading on PlayStation 2's of the Fellowship and Two Towers. The Return of the King got good marks from everybody and apparently with good reason.
4,Great PS2 combat game!!,"Return of the King is one of those games that you play like crazy then forget about it for a long time then you do it all over again, one of the games I will always keep in my collection."
4,Good Game but short,"If your like me, you LOVED the Return of the King movie. The game is just as great as its movie counterpart. In the game you have three paths you can follow. You can follow Gandalfs path, basically defending Minas Tirith as you defended Helms Deep in the previous game, if you follow the Hobbit path you take the role of Sam in such levels such as Shelobs lair. The other path is that of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimili, having them follow the path of the dead to the battle of Pelenoir Fields. Although this sounds like a lot of Gameplay, it really only takes about 8 hours to beat the main game with every character. So if your a fan of the Lord of the Rings, go get this game, but only if you like to replay levels a lot. If you dont, i strongly suggest at least a rental."
4,One of da best beat `em up games,"Action packed,hack `n slash.This game is action packed and has you running between objectives,slaughteringurak hai and alot of other evil creatures from tolkiens masterpiece at the same time.If you are a fan of the LOTR games you will definitly enjoy The Return of The King.The battles are much more nerve wrecking then the last two games so you are garunteed to be glued to the screen for a few hours.I love this game,but it sometimes gets annoyng because of the lack of check points.But all in all this is a great game and will keep you very happy and content untill the film comes out."
4,Return of the King PS2,"A top notch game. It is a little short, but makes up for it with great re-play value."
5,Cool and fun game,"Lord of the rings is a really fun game. It is very challenging at first but then it starts getting really fun. I recommend starting with the path of the wizard, then path of the hobbits, then the path of the king. Some levels are really fun(Cirith Ungol, Minas Tirith, Southern Gate, Crack of Doom) and some border on the terrible(Paths of the Dead, Pelloner Fields, Shelob's Lair)but once you beat it and unlock everything things get really fun though the secret characters are basicly just clones of Aragorn and Sam just like Isildur was a clone of Aragorn in the Two Towers. It is also a blast when playing 2 player co-op."
2,Pure Beat 'em Up,"I put this game down after just a couple of hours.I like role playing, puzzle solving and exploration games...this is not one of those."
4,did they make worthy battles??????,I so far love this game I baet it in three months and the enemies dont put up a good fight. they some times just remain still and dont bother to attack. there are only a few hard levels in this game the black gate and pelenor fields and minas tirith top of the wall. the trolls dont put up a figth either.The only hard enemies in this game are oliphonts and enemies with life meters. Over all a good game.
2,"Too hard, not enough save points","I enjoyed the gameplay, graphics etc. of this game. However it is unreasonably difficult. That plus the fact there are no save points within the levels makes it a thumbs down for me. I enjoy my PS2 but am not interested in making playing this (or any) game into a full time job. These guys who say they finished the game in a few days must me either professional gamers or have A LOT of free time."
5,Return to Middle-earth in this third installment of LOTR,"This game was awesome and it has become one of my favorite games. I rented it for 5 days and beat most of it. The details are awesome and I felt like I was next to Sam when he was trying to free Frodoin Shelob's Lair and in the action of the Paths of the Dead with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. My only regret is that some levels are too hard even with easy, yet after several tries, you beat it. This is only a minor flaw and still deserves the 5 stars."
4,"fun to play,but...","This game is fun to play, and if you are a lotr fan, you should get it. The fighting is fun for a while, but you just keep fighting the same kinds of orcs, and it gets a little boring. Some parts confused me, because I didn't know what to do, but once I found out what to do this game was a breeze. It was also too short. Having said that, this game does have many great features. The graphics are very good, as well as the music and the character voices. After you beat the game, you get 3 secret characters, and they're fun to play with for a while, and for some reason Pippin is better with a sword than Aragorn.Overall, I gave it 4 stars because it is very fun and addictive, but it was not perfect."
2,BAD AND GOOD,"this game is way to hard if ure 13 and under. youll get to like the third level on every guy and then its like impossible. its bad because when u get to these levels ure [in trouble because] there are no codes, you have to beat the game to have codes."
1,Just another Stupid Hack and Slash withannoying objectives,"Theres not much to say about this game its a hackin slash which means run around and press A and wack everyone.which I fine stupid It takes no skill to be good at this game all you need is to now were The A butun is and press that like crazy.Another annoying part is your always haveing to protect someone or something Protect the Gate,Dont let the wall get overwhelmed save Eowyn and merry by running catapult to catapul and firing at the big mean elephant and lizard thing.Its so stupid the crumy objectives they have you doing.They should of made it like star wars battle front with a mini tirth map or plenar fields map or something like that.Not this now dont get me wrong Im a big Lord of the Rings fan its just all the games have sucked.Being a lord of the rings fan wont ensure the liking of this game.People with weak minds and loike pressing the A buttun would love this game though"
4,The Best Game that has EVER Existed and Will Exist,"This game is the Perfect game for everyone!It is much better than all Winning Eleven games together!If you had to decide between throwing all Winning Eleven games to the trash or throwing this game to the trash (you have to decide one) you should throw all Winning Eleven games to the trash. Compared to this Winning Eleven is trash, nothing."
1,CRAPNESS thy name is the lord of the rings,"People who think that anything to do with the Lord of the Rings is good are twats. This is the crappest trilogy of books and films ever created. J.R.R Tolkien is an idiot to create such a pathetic set of books, and Peter Jackson is a fat wanker to create such a crap set of films. I urge anyone who feels strongly about the Lord of the Rings to e-mail me at jackd999@hotmail.com with their opinions. Up with crap, down with the Lord of the Ringsgollum"
3,"Hefty backpack, but not the best for comfort","This is a hefty backpack and its quite durable, it's just not the most fitting to your back. The main pocket it really large and that males my books fit strange and for some reason it doesn't fit in my back very well. But it is an overall good backpack"
4,Great pack for commuting,"I bought this for my sister for her commute to work after she saw a similar one that I was using. Great for distributing the weight unlike purses. She doesn't use a purse for work anymore, just the backpack. The leather is a nice, professional touch. I wasn't crazy about the mesh pockets on the side, but she uses it for her water bottle. One of the best values for this type of backpack that I saw."
2,"Product looks good, smells bad","I was happy at the appearance of the bag, but was extremely disappointed in the smell of the backpack. I received it around Christmas time and have had it hanging outside since hoping to air out the smell. It still smells making it unable to use."
2,same old stuff,"Don't get me wrong. I LOVE motoGP and love the fact that I can miss a race or two during the season and still pick up these season reviews, but they clearly need to step up the videos.I like the video shots of the european countries and all, but wouldn't it make more sense to spend a little more time in the paddock??As a fan of the sport, I would much rather see video about the racers and their preparation, hobbies, interests, challenges, etc. than seeing the lovely Spanish countryside.In a sport where they are starving for US attention, it would make more sense to me to play the ""personal"" card vs. the ""tourist"" card. Since the races this season were pretty ""ho-hum"" w/ Stoner's domination, it would have been good to see a LOT more behind the scenes."
1,Boring,"This toy is boring, doesn't match lego toy so can't combine building sets. Truck does not continue to move when pushed. Wheels do not allow corners."
1,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Battle Shell Bridge,"My child received this for Christmas and was so excited because he loves the Ninja Turtles. When we went to put it together, I found this to be the most frustrating toy ever! First of all, any toy with 290 very small pieces is really not something that the average 5 year old (yet alone an average 10 year old) can handle so this is definitely a toy that an adult needs to put together - if they can! My husband who can put ANYTHING together washed his hands of the whole project after an hour and a half of unsuccesfully trying to stick the pieces together. The design is bad, the pieces don't stick together (maybe they're too small???), and the diagram is 28 pages long! I give this toy 2 thumbs down!"
2,Very disappointed!,"I chose this rating not because of the actual music, but that it was illegally duplicated. In other words....... THIS IS A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL CD. The main clue is the different color on the face of the CD. This does match the original CD A covering. I know because I once had this CD in my collection"
3,Cute; but disappointing,Ok so I like Girls aloud a lot and i think that Sugababes are OK: but this is not at all of their usual standards. I likes Walk this way by Aerosmith AND by RUN DMC but somehow this is not that good. Take two talented girl bands: one which can do perfect pop (Girls Aloud) and one that is slightly more hip (Sugababes) and have them murder a nice hard rock /hip hop crossover classic. OK it is for a good cause so I do not care but still they could and should have done a lot better. Shame on all of them...
1,Hideous,"I've smelled this stuff before. When I detected it today on someone in the gym, I asked what it was so I could be sure to avoid it. It is one of the most hideous scents I have ever encountered in something that is, supposedly, a perfume. Why can't I choose ZERO stars???"
5,best perfume out there,"I own probably 20 bottles of perfume and when I wear Angel, EVERYONE asks what I'm wearing. I almost hate to say what brand it is, because now all my friends wear it!"
2,Lacks Any Useful Detail,"I bought this book, among others, to help get me up to speed on the legal aspects of ERISA. However, the book was a huge disappointment. While it covers a wide-range of topics, the book's sparse details make it mostly worthless. If you are an attorney, law clerk or other legal professional, do NOT get this book."
3,it didnt help me,this book really didnt help me much. I found the In a Nut Shell much more useful for a law student learning this area of the law.
5,This book should be part of your personal business library!,"I highly recommend this book for ALL Financial Advisors involved in providing financial advice to individual 401K participants. Mr. Ziesenheim's second book ""Protect Your 401K"" is a great follow up!"
2,"Complex story, but I liked the movie better","I love to read, but somehow I stumbled onto the movie version of this story first. I liked the story so much that I got the book. The book is incredibly well written from a technical standpoint, but it plodded so much that I got bored with it pretty early on. I kept wanting to get to the heart of the story, but it just took sooo long. Don't get me wrong, I like books with a lot of detail: Jane Austen, Henry James, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, etc... This book just took too long to get to the part of the story that captured my attention in the first place. I can't say whether I recommend it or not. I believe this one truly is a matter of style preference. Good luck!"
3,Great Album,"For some odd reason people in my city (ERIE, PA) don't know who Gary Numan is. Its really annoying because it's not like he's a no-name ya know? Anyways i've gone to numerous stores around here (CD Warehouse, BuyBack$, Playworld, Exchange, etc, etc....) and none of them carry any of his albums, or know who he is. Its a shame i tell ya, anyways i'm glad i can always count on amazon for having his cd's.This was a great buy!"
4,A wonderful junp-starter to your life recording your life.,I have thoroughly enjoyed this kit. It has not only been a great aid in writing an autobiography but has helped me to jump-start my journal on many slow days.
2,Not Enough Good Stuff,"This DVD with a bonus CD is simply not worth the price. It is interesting if you're a fan of 50 Cent. The version I'm writing about says clean version but my copy isn't clean. There's a lot of back and forth between 50 and his crew, interviews, studio sessions, and interviews. Most of it is 50 and his friends smoking dope and acting silly, which is fine, but I found it quite boring and at times banal.The best parts of the DVD are the music videos and the live performance in Detroit, where Eminem makes and appearance.The songs on the bonus CD are not much of a bonus.Overall, not really worth the $$$."
2,No Point,"If you are really interested in the videos and missed when they came on, this is it for you. The songs are just introduction of G-Unit, mostly his crew. 8-Mile is remix. Nothing really special here. DVD shows video and making of video and video for Heat that never came on.CD:Delivery: BProdcutiON: BLyrics: B-Overall: BDVD:ProductiOn: B+Rewatch Value: DSound: B+Overall: B-"
1,this is [garbage],"this cd is 50 at his worest. I think 50 is awful now. Before he was famous he was much betta.Now tha dude doesnt even write his own lyrics or make his own beats.Hes the biggest sell out i have eva seen.People need to get ova this sell out and start listening to betta ppl like Atmosphere ,Trick Daddy or NaS they are 100 times less of a sell out than this dude.Hes a joke"
4,A pretty good read.,"Waylon tells his story in an entertaining manner. Overall I have enjoyed the book and found it entertaining. Not the best book I have read in the past 6 months but certainly not the worst. If you have an interest in Waylon, from Waylon's point of view, it is worth reading."
4,Waylon Jennings,"Great book. It explained Waylon as an individual artist who insisted on doing most things his own way and the price he paid to do it. It described his wild and wooly lifestyle and interaction with other outstanding artists such as Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash, and Willie Nelson. The world would be a sadder place indeed if it were not for artists like them."
4,Waylon,This is to easy to say that I like this book. I'ts a auto bio by the man him self and I'm a big fan so I think its great.
3,Are you sure Hank did it this away....,Book is full of great stories. Paints a good picture of the music business.
4,I Miss Waylon,"This is a well written and entertaining as told to autobiography of Waylon Jennings and has all you would expect from a Waylon biography if you are familiar with his music and life.. More often than not, even if they make great music, most musicians are phony narcistic human beings. Waylon is a guy thats hard not to like and I enjoy his music. I wish he was still around."
2,There are better versions,"I am a Nielsen fan who bought this recording several years ago. I feel disappointed every time I listen to this CD. This recording lacks the sharp, well defined sound one expects of a modern digital recording -- a problem that dramatically lessens the impact of the brisk and bubbly Maskarade Overture, and the opening march of Aladdin. Except perhaps for Nielsen's orchestral nocturne, Saga-Dream, the performances are never better than average."
4,Cameo's Definitive Collection Treat,I have always liked Cameo and this CD does not disappoint me! I am impressed by the selections in this CD. Cameo has so many songs until it can be a real task selected popular known songs compared to ones inside of the many previous albums. I am impressed by this CD and will enjoy it always!
3,Funkeriffic,"For the novice Cameo fan. After henaring this, you can move on up to the 12"" collection. Cameo is a danceable funk group with rhythm. Listen cautiously!"
3,pin prick,"My four year old is heart broken - a pin prick in his stretch. Ours too does not have blue gloves or boots, not sure if that matters.Does anyone know how to repair a pin prick?"
4,great,"this toy is really cool. its fun to just mess around with it and change its shape. i highly recomend you buy this toy for your kids because you just can't seem to keep your hands off of it! adults will like this toy also, as it works just like a stress reliever."
4,"Delightful Mr. Fantastic: well-done head; body, not as resiliant.","MR. FANTASTIC is a well-conceived doll from the outset; with an astonishingly good likeness of Dr. Reed Richards, as far as the head and face are concerned. The doll-makers went to great lengths to capture the handsome features of actor Ioan Gruffudd; which, as far as us over-grown female fans are concerned, is of top importance; you bet! But, when it comes to the body, there is a lack of ability for the product to return to the original shape. DAMN that Von Doom, anyway! And the lack of the boots and gloves gives the product an unfinished appearance. What a shame, as you started out so well... Still, Mr. Fantastic is still, well, FANTASTIC; everything considered. And believe me: I am WELL over the age of 13!"
3,"""FUNtastic"" Toys","Generally, quite a fun toy for a kid between 5-8 Years.Mr. Fantastic really stretches, however it would have been even better if the digits(Hands)were able to be manipulated like his limbs.My ""Mr. Fantastic"" didn't come with the black boots & gloves as advertised on T.V as well as on the box. That was very disappointing!! It makes him appear incomplete."
1,This was a big disappointment,"I got this for my 5 year old son and it got a hole under the arm on the first day. We did not do any of the things the manufacturer said not to do with the toy, i.e. twist it or pull the head. We were pulling on it together just like the boys on the box and at some point it got a small hole, which the manufacturer says is ""no problem"" and to just put a bandage on it. This is a joke, as the hole got bigger and the goo inside continued to leak and get all over the place and a bandage does not solve the problem. Even at half the price this would have been a huge waste of money. I have never been so disappointed with a toy."
5,Outstanding product!,"I was rather skeptical at first but the Siwak really DOES work. It makes the teeth feel incredibly clean and the breath naturally fresh. I still use a traditional toothbrush and baking soda for morning and evening brushing but the Siwak makes afternoon tooth cleaning while away from home easy! Just pop the stick in your pocket or purse and ""brush"" teeth without toothpaste or water anytime, anywhere!"
3,Purple Eyebrows?!,"Here are 12 internet cartoons that may have inspired the film. Eddie Griffin introduces each clip. I wonder if this influenced ""The Simpsons"" episode where Bart drew ""Angry Dad."" The shorts are so small that Eddie Griffin's introductions are almost as long. This is cheap animation where only one person or object moves at a time. It may remind you of ""Spiderman"" or other cartoons made in the late 1960s. Its biting racial commentary may remind some of David Chappelle's Show. This film takes shots at many real people such as Jim Brown, Alan Keyes, and Whitney Houston. It tries to balance things by making fun of itself: cracking jokes about BET and Eddie Griffin. If you liked ""L'il Pimp"" or the actual ""Undercover"" film, you might as well see this."
4,DAVID BOWIE!!!!,The David Bowie song is frikin awesome!Id would spend [the amount] just for that one song!!Why? Because Phish is just awesome and I cant even describe it.Only fans of these guys would know it.Sorry to the people who don't know much about Phish cause this review probably won't help you too much.Alright Peace out
4,This is no game!,"These reviews are not exagerrating or being dramatic at all. The David Bowie towards the beginning of the 2nd set really is as good as everyone says. You must hear it to understand. This jam to me signifies everything Phish is about and what they are capable of. In fact, I wish they'd just release set 2 because set 1 is pretty boring and standard with no real surprises or outstanding jams."
2,Nothing outstanding here,This saw stand has over the last year been more and more of a dissapointment. As my peers have noticed the outriggers can not be leveled with the saw table... I repeat... CAN NOT be leveled... there is no adjustment available or possible... saw is too heavy for the table and this was the table suggested by Hitachi... when you grab that saw there is sway and motion back and forth. I can't help but wonder if this would be hazordous.
2,Hitachi Miter Saw Stand,"Overall I am pretty happy with this product. I am not very happy with the extension arms, not level to working table of chopsaw, a little to flimsy when adjusted to the height needed! For on site work, you can make it work!"
2,Could be better,"I've had the stand for more than a year and have grown increasingly disappointed. I'm using it w/a Makita LS1214L which is a little big but regardless the stand has inherent problems. The locking base has a tendancy to unlock during transport. The more you move it around, the greater the chance the saw will detach. The support rests can be difficult to level with the saw table making intricate trim cuts somewhat of a problem. Finally, the wheel base is now bent from rolling the saw around.All-in-all, the stand is stable when in use but you have to be extra careful when in transport. If you wish to detach the saw everytime you relocate it, then the stand is acceptable. However, there are better compound miter saw stands in this price range."
1,rubbish,I think this book is a pile of rubbish- it talks about lots of boring stuff but nothing interesting!!!!! I have read alot of this authors books and the rest were good but this one was total pants infact I think it is the worst book I have ever read (apart from Harry Potter but that's a different story) I would not recommend this book to anybody!
3,Pletnev misses the mark,"I think it was Sante Fe Listener who commented that he likes his Liszt a little rough rather than beatifully played. I feel the same way about the Dvorak Slavonic Dances. Listening to this recording, I missed the rough and tumble slavic character so well conveyed in the not nearly as well recorded disc by KubelikDvorak: Slavonic Dances,Opp. 46 & 72 ~ Kubelik / Bavarian Radio Symphony OrchestraThese are, after all Slavonic Dances - not miniature symphonic poems.The full reverberant sound of the recording also wore on my ears after awhile - still for what this disc is going for through third party sellers, its a more than acceptable introduction to this frolicsome music for Dvorak newbies. But for bohemian authenticity, stick with Kubelik. Or HarnoncourtDvorak: Slavonic Dances"
5,Lions touch all mankind,"This movie was true and very entertaining, with romance, action, heart and soul. It had a message for everyone, no matter what country you live in. We found hope from the things they are doing today in Tanzania... No movie has touched my husband and I as much as this one. If you can only see one movie this year, make it To Walk with Lions."
5,A Must See,"The story of Elsa goes on after her death, the good will and the work the Anderson’s started and the tragic way they both died. It is a must see if you loved ‘Born Free’ the movie or the book, or if you saw ‘Elsa’s Legacy.’ This gives a more in-depth depiction of what went on behind the seen."
5,To walk with Lions,This tape was in good condition. I am not to friendly with DVD'S and can set up for tapes without any problems. Thanks!!!( To walk with Lions)
1,Full of inaccuracies.,"This movie was full of inaccuracies. Tony Fitzjohn did not take the lion cubs and raise them. This kind deed was done by Gareth Patterson who truly respected George Adamson. Gareth Patterson wrote about this in his books titled The Lions Legacy and Last of the Free. This movie should have focused on George Adamson and it should have been more accurate and realistic.If you want to see a movie with the real George Adamson, as himself, then make sure to view the entertaining and touching movie titled Christian the Lion! He is also featured in the movie titled An Elephant Called Slowly. Both of these movies are available on video. Why watch a fake when you can watch the real thing!"
1,For Michael Ende&#65533;s Sake - Don&#65533;t Buy It!!!,"Please heed my words and avoid this movie! Michael Ende's novel ""The Neverending Story"" is my all-time favorite book, and I believe to be one of the most original and inspiring fantasies ever written. But this... THIS adaptation of it is an outrage! ""They"" have altered Ende's ideals to appeal to a brain-washed Potter-crazed society! For example, the befreckled redhead, Bastian, has two close friends - a black-haired bespectacled boy, and a frizzy-haired brunette girl. Together, they engage in outrageous and downright ridiculous escapades between classes at their middle school... how much lower can you get? Ende set out to write a story which could stand by itself as a completely original story. And now it has been raped and twisted into this abomination! Please - PLEASE - do not support it by purchasing it! If you do, trust me, it will only end up on eBay. READ THE BOOK... thanks."
3,Not never ending,This movie got so far from the original that it lost some of the whimsy in the original.But it was told though different eyes.
3,You guys are being a bit overly critical!,"This movie is not as bad as you guys are saying. I just watched it no more than 30 minutes ago. I thought the story was pretty good. I enjoyed it alot. I am 22 years old and a huge fan of The Neverending Story. I thought it was interesting to see a new take on the story. I enjoyed the characters in the fantasy story more than the real one, mainly because of the actors. I felt that they could have gotten a much better actor for the dad, he seemed to me to be more of a stage actor than for screen.As for the way it left you hanging. I don't think it left me hanging anymore than ""LOTR: Fellowship Of The Rings"" did. I think the way it ending was in a way symbolic. The scenario in the ""real world"" had an ending, but the way the story in Fantasia didn't really have closure was to symbolize the fact that it's the ""Neverending"" story. I think it's definatly worth seeing."
3,Tales From The Neverending Story - The Beginning,"I was disappointed to see what they did with the original characters. And I really don't like being left hanging at the end. But my children enjoyed most of the movie, which is still about good versus evil. Since I bought it for them and not for myself, I think that it is an ok movie."
3,Its a decent movie,"While not like the book so much, it is still a good movie. I like how they link the fantasy and real world. The acting is OK...And there is another comment that today's kids would not like the original never ending story... I really do not feel that is justified.. Harry Potter does not spoil kids imaginiations to watch different styled films and enjoy them...I just want to see more of the video's. It just makes me want to read the book again. Which, by the way the movie encourages: reading.Samantha"
5,Useful to have for non-profit professional organizations,"I got this as a reference to use at meetings. Often the audience will chirp up to ask what Roberts Rules says is the correct protocol, and without an official parlimentarian, most of us lay people are at a loss. This is a great resource becasue it is easy to read (as easy as you can get with Robert's rules) and easy to transport: does not take up a lot of room in the secretaries brief case."
5,kindle is great for rec'g books instantly.,the more i use kindle the better it gets and the more i increase my knowledge of its splendid offerings.
5,Catherine Cookson at her best,"Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Love Catherine Cookson and her ""love triumphs over all"" themes, and would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read. Set at the turn of the century in England, the book is set around the differences between the rich and the poor, and the people who lived and loved during that period."
3,"essentially cookson, but not her best","Cookson tends to be hit or miss with me- her writing is fluid, her stories are clear, but sometimes it seems her message and morality are just...dated. It's fun to take a look back and see what ""normal"" was from her POV, but its hard to relate to a book that has as its driving conflict a pregnant teenager rescued by marrying someone beneath her station... especially when the heart of the conflict is class war, not misunderstood love, or teen pregnancy. I feel like she had the wrong focus and I just couldn't connect to the story at all."
1,Terrible Transfer - Good Movie,"If any of my old videofile customers are still out there that bought laserdiscs from Sight & Sound in Waltham, MA., you'll know that when I tell you this dvd is bad, it's bad! The widescreen laserdisc was much better than this terrible dvd. It seems the company that put this dvd out is not interested in giving the buyer a decent movie experience. The movie itself is classic sci-fi at it's best! I would not recommend this version to any of my old customers. You usually get what you pay for!"
3,Great Film with Technical Problems,"The DVD arrived on time and the film was every bit as exciting when I saw it as a child. The only problem with it was the sound track, which was great throughout a good three quarters of the film, but died about 18 minutes before the end. My partner and I watched the rest of it in silence. The story was simple enough to follow without the sound track, but it did spoil a rather special reunion with an old classic."
3,"The best ""plant menace"" film.","This film version of John Wyndham's novel does not quite live up to its potential, but is reasonably well done and enjoyable. The basic gimmick (giant poisonous plants menacing a world in which 99 percent of the population has suddenly gone blind) cannot help but provide some excitement, and a few scenes are very effective -- the streets of London in shambles due to sudden mass blindness, the arrival of a train filled with blind passengers and crew, etc. But the ""triffids"" themselves are un-convincing. A 1981 TV version was better in most respects."
2,"Good story, but movie needs some help","As much as I liked the book, and the whole idea of triffids, it could have been done a lot better. Also, this movie has some of the absolute worst movie music I have ever heard. I watched with the sound muted a good part of the time. Let's hope somebody remakes it soon."
1,MISLED BY BAD AMAZON INFO,"I should have read more comments before buying this garbage for almost $25. It's described as wide screen - something I've been looking for forever - but it's just another AWFUL pan and scan hack job.It's a disgrace that AMAZON doesn't correct the information on this product after all the complaints about this misinformation. Moreover, they shouldn't even be selling it as it is a worthless junk!UPDATE: I purchased this directly FROM AMAZON and not the Marketplace and ultimately Amazon gave me a full refund."
1,"This is the WRONG ""Day of the Triffids"". . .","Compared to the great 1981 version of the Day of the Triffids, this Howard Keel version is really pathetic.The 1981 version for some crazy reason has not been made available for the USA. We need it! It is much closer to the great book by John Wyndham. It seems to me when it was first released it was shown both on USA and British TV.* * NEWS FLASH: this, better version of ""Triffids"" HAS NOW BEEN RELEASED IN THE USA ! (as of April 2008)The 1981 version was produced by David Maloney and starred John Duttine and Emma Relph. It really gives you the creeps in the same way the greatest horror movies of aliens wiping us out, such as 'Body Snatchers,' has you looking over your shoulder for weeks afterward. But this 1962, badly reproduced hollywood version? Forget about it."
4,I enjoyed the book after I got past the 2nd chapter,"The day of the triffids is a very interesting story and I enjoed it. I think that it is a very interesting story, and would like to see how they do the movie. The day of the triffids is a bit dated in the content it uses more 50's stuff but has some ideas of a Sci-fi book. END"
1,LOOKING FOR A BAD FILM WITH FEW REDEEMING QUALITIES?,"This movie is just begging for the folks from ""Mystery Science Theatre"" to take a seat in the front row. Killer plants from outer space terrorize Earth and dismay movie fans everywhere. How do these plants manage to stay rooted while transversing across Europe? Don't ask but they need not be plants for all their maneuverability. Why not killer frozen TV dinners from outer space? How about terrifying air freshener from Mars? The plants, kind of a cross between walking cactuses and seaweed, are finally lured away by a Spanish ice cream truck with a melody that sounds like the tune from ""Close Encounters of The Third Kind"" as sung by an out of key doorbell. It gets no better than this for lovers of bad film. Favorite line: As a scientist is dissecting a plant to learn it's origin, he screams in exasperation, ""Dammit, I'm not even a botanist!"" I howled."
3,Attack of the Rubber Walking Plants,"This movie wasn't too bad, being a classic B-rated sci-fi thriller from out of England. Day of the Triffids, based on the similarly named novel, was actually better than most Brittish B movies I've seen. The movie is pretty good the first time around, but eventually, it does get warn out. If you think this movie is great, buy it. If you haven't seen it yet, it'll be on TNT plenty times."
4,Dioxin-free plants that mutate to destroy mankind,"One of the most amazing scary movies of all time. Next time you water your plants - just think, it may turn on you and devour you even though you have nurtured it lovingly. Be careful - be very,very careful: it may well be a triffid."
2,ANOTHER ANGRY FAN....,I was already waiting for this DVD to arrive when I read the other reviews. Otherwise I would have cancelled my order. This is a fine British sci-fi horror shocker that is well done in color and capably acted. It's one of my favorites. What this Allied Artists company has done with it is astonishingly awful....I'm just sick over their utter gall to release this neglected gem in such terrible condition. It's so faded and poorly reproduced that you can't even enjoy it....
1,Day of the Triffids Marketing A Bad Copy,"I've bought two dvd's of Day of the Triffids (wonderful movie and follows original story reasonably close) and both have flakey video. My vhs copy bought 20 years ago is better than the one advertised above. This is a great film but needs to be remastered. I also have the pal version which is better than the one above. Just saw a new version on e-bay and I am wondering if I will get hammered again if I buy it. If these companies are going to reissue a great film how about a first generation copy taken from the master and not from an old vhs copy. Artisian and Criterdon remaster great oldies. I wish they would pick this one up too. So, I'll give this copy a D+ at best. Wonderful film. Too bad its a bad copy."
2,is there a clean copy of this film around??????,The film itself has always been kind of silly but ive always liked it ..but the video and audio quality on this DVD are truly terrible and i had hoped after the terrible quality of the VHS that the DVD would be better but ohhhh well if you have the VHS don't bother to buy the DVD...
2,Interesting but nothing like the book,"Wyndam's original book is still a very effective and frightening book which has lost none of it's freshness even though it is nearly 50 years old. This film is a fairly good story, although badly executed and with poor effects even for the early sixties, but it is very unfaithful to the book which actually focuses on the survival of a small number of survivors of a global calamity and the moral choices they face in how to deal with the millions of still alive, but doomed, blinded people. This film with its simplified story and happy ending does none of these things but is an average early 60s British SF film. However, if it interests you read the book and if you get a chance watch the 1981 BBC adaptation (not regrettably on video) for a much more faithful adaptation."
4,A true classic but quality could be better,"It is presented in its original widescreen format, Which I prefer but the transfer has undergone no cleaning up that I can detect. The color is faded out, drab, and the film really shows it's age. However it is a complete version and I'am happy to have it in my collection"
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"This movie isn't QUITE the bottom of the barrel, but it's close! The premise is interesting and the acting isn't bad, but production quality is often embarrassing (mangy looking ""triffids"" obviously mounted on carts), the transfer to DVD is worse, and the added footage of the couple trapped in the lighthouse is just incongruous. I'd give it 1.5 stars if that were possible on Amazon. Do yourself a favor and buy the novel (by John Wyndham) instead of this stinker!"
2,This version from Cheezy.... missing audio ?,"Note: I really liked this movie as a kid ..and i still love it now...butI bought the Day of the Triffids, the version put out by a company called cheezy or something....Hey the movie looks great compared to other version, but the last 20 minutes there is no audio, i dont know if its only my copy that has the problem, but i was really dissapointed. If anybody else had that audio problem, please leave me a comment."
1,Nothing Like the Book,"For one who loved the book, little if any resemblance, except for possibly, partially, at the very beginning. Poorly acted, and absolutely didn't follow anything in the book. Pity to write this, particularly after reading of the Producer/Director/Writer Philip Yordan's death at 99 the day after I saw the video. Incidentally, my copy of the video had a non-stop background of audio for a carwash liquid commercial, ad nauseum, for the entire 90 minutes of the movie. Irritating at the best. An example of poor reproduction of a movie poorly done that bore no resemblance to the plot of the book."
5,The Next Day of the Triffids,"To all Triffids' fans, a new pristine version of your favorite film has been produced! Late last year, I attended a screening of a clean, beautiful copy of this film at its premiere at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. It was a wonderful evening for me. The female lead, Janette Scott, sent a lovely telegram congratulating the leader of this painstaking restoration, and her two children attended as well as Howard Keel's widow. It was fantastic to see the film as it was intended and released to theaters and to also hear many funny stories of how it was filmed. We must hope that the new version soon will be released to the marketplace, supplanting the current, old version that is ugly and flawed. I apologize again to my wife for deceiving her into attending the screening with me. I told her a Triffid is the name of Roger Vivier's new line of flats. She couldn't wait to see one."
1,Repulsive-Day of the Triffids,I wish I had read the other negative reviews. This DVD is a repulsively poor quality rip-off version of a great classic. Do not buy it. Wait for a decent wide-screen transfer of this film. Demand high quality.
3,Flesh eating plants threaten survivors of a world in ruins.,"A new species of predatory plants, called Triffids, roam civilization's ruins after most of the world's population is blinded, the after effects of a strange meteor shower. A few survivors must fight to survive evading the Triffids which have taken advantage of humanity's misfortune and have begun feasting on human flesh. The movie manages to maintain some level of credulity until the end with its prepostorous conclusion and its revelation of a solution to the Triffid infestation. This is a first class B grade movie in the tradition of Angry Red Planet, material suitable for Joe Bob's monster movie show on TNT."
3,A Trifle of Triffids.,The idea of alien vegitation coming to Earth on meteors is really a story that should reinterprited with todays video manipulation and special effects. The meteors blind those who look upon their fiery vapor trails to boot. It seemed more frightening to me as a child watching on an old RCA black and white TV set. The DVD captures the basic story with a no frills spookiness typical of the late 1950's - early 1960's style. It was worth the price I paid to relive a bit of childhood sci-fi fantasy. If your looking for hi-tech video effects this movie is not for you. It does have a certain charm I enjoyed viewing after a 40 year hiatus.
4,Day of the Triffids Review,"Other than the DVD being delivered to the wrong address, which was NOT the sellers fault, but the USPS' fault, it shipped as agreed, cost as agreed and was packaged very securly.I remember this cheesy movie from my youth and was delighted to spend an hour and a half watching the horrible acting and lame effect.Love it!"
2,Laserdisc version ?,I bought a copy of this movie online from a laserdisc transfer . I read a few reviews that this is from a vhs transfer :( Anyone have any input on this and any news of a new edition hopefully on blu-ray sometime soon ?
1,Save Your Money,"This is one of my favourite 50's Sci-Fi OldiesBut this the WORST DVD Transfer EVER. Bad Colour,Fuzzy Focus ,Pan & Scan"
3,Looks better on LASERDISC!!!,"This is an o.k. film for the SF exploitation genre, however, all of the existing DVD transfers are either in the wrong aspect ratio or very badly mastered. There IS a decent print out there, somewhere, as I have it on letterboxed laserdisc (...My laserdisc player is alive and well, thank you--after two of my VCR's have conked out--SO THERE!!!) Wait and see. Maybe someone like THE ROAN GROUP (Roan Group, are you listening?) who specialize in restoring and remastering forgotten films will pick up the distribution."
3,Day of the Triffids - Wide Screen,I love the movie Day of the Triffids. This second release brought the movie out in letterbox the way the movie was filmed which is way better. But the quality is not that great. The colour is washed out and it does not look like a new transfer or remastered like the write up says. It is a pricey DVD for the quality of this movie and not being a well known company that put it out. There is also cheapy ad's before the movie starts.But it is good to have it wide screen at least.
1,ANOTHER CHEEZY OFFERING,"Well, many of us are finally getting to enjoy our old favorites on high quality DVD. Or are we? You certainly will not find any great quality in this poor DVD offering. The overall transfer is horrible to say the least. And they can't blame it on a lack of original source material, as the last Laser Disc edition and the current UK DVD edition are really quite nice.Do yourself a favor and track down a nicer offering, they're around."
2,Day of the Triffids,"I was very excited to see the movie come out in DVD, but verydisappointed that they did pan and scan on it. It wasfilmed in 2.35, so you lost half the movie. The transferquality was not that good.I have it in 2.35 in laser, and hope it will be re-issued ata later day wide screen."
1,Blooming ...,"The images bloom and fade and blur and fade out and....One minute to the next the image gets lighter, darkerand the colors change.Over all very poor editing.Simple editing with non professional software could havedone better."
4,"SHE LOVES ME, SHE KOVES ME NOT, SHE SLIMED ME!","After a fantastic light show, given by millions of space fragments, a strange and wonderful thing happens. All the population of earth is struck with blindness, the glare from the lights have some how burned out the optic nervs of all whom have seen the show. this was done to ensure that the plant food would not run away, yes you guessed it, mankind is now the plant food(gives a new light to a vegitarian diet), this is a race to save onesself and the planet. be sure to take note of the way we over come our visitors, there are shades of ""war of the worlds"" mixed through this selection. also, in this note the strong family unity. It is most visable in two sceens. Most of all our stars, not only do they have spoors, slime, but they can move about, yes that is right, thay can up root themselves from their bed, and move around to reek havoc on a helpless world. this film is great, on see this with your sweetheart, and see if she wants flowers ever again."
1,Not worth the money,"Like other customers, I found that this DVD was a very poor copy of the film which I had been waiting to purchase for a long time."
4,It was a good book.,"It was a good book, but I would have liked it better if the reding level was higher (I read this book because of it's content, not it's reading level. I normaly read books that are on the adult level.). It was a book that I wish I could have read when I was 6 or 7. I'm not saying that the book was on an easy reading level, it's just that I have been reading adult books ever scince I can remember."
4,Hawaii Scooter Commuter,"Fit well: I bought one size larger for overpants and that worked.Finish/Durability: Seem sturdy and well made, but I've only had them for 1 month.Features: I can get them on and off over boots. Good venting through long leg zips. Good protectors on knees and hips but none on butt. Ankle fasteners keep them organized around your boots.Cost Benifit/Overall Impression: I feel better protected with them on and like them a lot so far. They might be too warm for long rides during Hawaii summers (on really hot and humid days)even with the liner out and the vents open, but for short rides they should be all right."
3,"It's brutal, and depressing.","This movie was shot in a documentary style. It brutally and realistically depicts those European girls who were sold to prostitution by false promises of good jobs in other countries. There are raping, and beating scenes.The acting is OK.The only thing I don't like about it is it does not have subtitle.It's worth watching once."
5,ANY CHILD WOULD ENJOY THIS,"MY COUSINS KIDS HAD THIS AND MY SON ASKED FOR IT, SO I GOT IT FOR HIM FOR CHRISTMAS.......HES 10 AND HE LOVES IT, I FIND IT HARD TO DO, BUT THE KIDS DO SEEM TO GET IT AND DO IT WELL."
4,Great Game!!!!,"This game is lots of fun! The only thing I didn't like about it was that if you don't like Pop. or Rap/R&B the music isn't that good. The workout mode is awesome, you can set a goal and it keeps track of how many calories you burn! I would definitely recommend this game! Oh, and in case you were wondering (I know I was) it doesn't come with the eye toy!"
5,omg this is like the best game in the whole world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"ok, let me tell u folks that this game is such a blast!!!! and im not kidding! i played this at my aunts house and were getting one of our own. this is a game that gives you a lot of exercise and a totally fun time. u listen to music and move your feet! u could pick up some new awesome hits and moves! folks, this is a game that i soooooooooooo do recommend to anyone of any age! u will have the best time of your life! so buy it! please! you will be happy........and healthy! BE HAPPY, BE HEALTHY!"
5,I love it.,This is one of the best toaster I have ever owned. The color is a medium to dark metallic red. The toast is perfect every time. I would recommend this toaster to everyone.
2,Doesn't do what it says on the can,"If you are a professional investor or trader don't buy this book. You won't learn anything particularly useful. The only information that was of any use pertained to the ""creation"" aspect, but this was too brief to be of any real use. On the ""managing"" side of things it went into a lot of subjects that were applicable to portfolio management in general rather than exclusively to hedge funds. Anyone who is thinking of setting up a hedge fund will have been running a long only fund or trading a book long enough to know all of this.Informative and easy to read for the lay person, private investor or student, but of no practical use to anyone who might actually be looking to set up their own fund. Certainly not a professional's guide."
2,60 Pages of Applicable Information,"Years ago I swore never to read another book with the words ""How To"" in the title. I broke that rule and am now very sorry I did. To be fair, there are a couple of good chapters in this book. Chapter 10 on regulation is a nice overview of the subject, and chapter 12 makes a valiant effort, but ultimately fails to make hedge fund taxation lucid. Unfortunately much of the book is unabashed filler. Chapter 11 is titled ""Accounting for Hedge Funds"", but is instead a 15 page overview of the first week of Freshman level accounting. Chapter 15 takes ten pages to explain the obvious and intuitive parallels of hedge fund cash flows to options. I got about 60 pages of applicable information on the subject out of a 300 page book, and still feel ripped off. Why is it that there are so many terrible books about money management?"
3,Another college textbook,"For those readers interested in running money through a hedge fund this is an okay book. (Note: For those interested in running money through a mutual fund, I recommend Start a Successful Mutual Fund by Melinda Gerber.)Mr. McCrary's book discusses broad topics about the industry but also covers some things that can be learned better from a specialty book about marketing or business plan writing. It does not mention how hedge funds are getting into private equity, prime brokers, Sarbanes-Oxley, or the Anti-Money Laundering Act. It is also weak on specific details about how to run a fund day-to-day.In general the book reminded me of a college textbook. It is most valuable to anyone who wants a good beginning knowledge of hedge funds."
2,Dissapointing,"This book only gives a brief overview to the actual nuts and bolts of starting a hedge fund. Instead it spends time explaining various hedge fund strategies, risk-management approaches, and basic entity structures (what is a c-corp? what is an s-corp? what is an llc?).As someone who has started a fund in the past and is looking to start another, this book was a disappointment. If you are learning the info in this book for the first time, you probably shouldn't be starting a fund in the first place."
3,Appropriate for beginners,"While I wasn't expecting much, from reading the mediocre reviews posted here, I was surprised to find fairly decent amount of valuable information in the book, albeit for a novice in the hedge fund world.For instance, the structure of a hedge fund was explained to me by one of the best lawyers who specializes in setting up hedge funds, here on the west coast. The charts that were used in the book mirrored the thoughts of the lawyer.Within the last 2 years, the industry has changed drastically and quickly that some issues/rules/regulations are outdated. I would recommend this book for the reader who is looking at a hedge fund for the very first time."
3,Still need a lawyer,"Tells you everything you need to know; however you will still need a good lawyer to set you up properly. I bought the book first, and then still spent tens of thousands of dollars to set up my fund."
4,A very Informative book.,I needed this book to learn how to put a business team together and develop a business model for the fund I wanted to create. This book was one key piece to getting that done. A worthwhile read.
4,Criticisms don't make sence to me....,"While admittedly there is a lot of fluff in this book - ie explaining strategy and instruments, there is a lot of valuable advise on creating the structure of the company and constructing a business plan.If your looking for someone to tell you how to trade in the financial markets you probably shouldn't be starting a fund."
2,so so,"Im the biggest Ray Luv fan out, id probably buy a whole album for one or two good songs, sadly thats all this has, the coup d eatat was a hitter, i burnt it up, but this one i wasn't feeling except for a few alright songs , hope he brings it back next one cause hes one of my fovrite rappers out"
4,More WIDESCREEN sword and sandal with good picture,"Recently I'v been on a buying spree as far as these kind of movies are concerned, This is another Wide screen job, with good Picture quality. The second flic- is a little obscrer but, but you ussually don't get two big ones on the one DVD, ."
2,NOT GOOD!,Sorry but must say that this DVD is worst. Bad Quality done from a reddish print andI think also CUT.
1,Boring Lifeless movie,"Kinda surprised I did not like this one, but whoever made this, put a lot of money into a flop. I think they tried to make a benhur without Christ as the Focal point of repentance, and took the name of Samson but without the great blessings of God in his final deathbed repentance, and thought that many would watch glory to men and false gods of egypt:-). The acting turned out lifeless, with no real entertainment value than if someone had taken some mud and thew them at the gold plated screen. So sad all the money spent to glorify other gods. Give me 10 Commandments or Ben Hur (the new cartoon or the older movie) or The Robe. This movie turned out to be 1/1000th of the value of those movies. Such a sad waste of talent and time :-(."
3,I hope they send flowers in the morning,"There is no delicate way to put this, but at these prices Aeroquip should at least send flowers or candy the next morning. It's a lot of money for two tiny pieces.To make matters worse NPT has a tapered thread. These plugs seem straight sided. I had to run the Aeroquip plugs through a taper die before using them.I guess this is the only game at Amazon if want a compact and and inobtrusive way to plug a 1/4"" NPT like opening. I really would have been happier with a 316 stainless NPT plug but this was all I could find with the hex drive.On a more positive note, they are a pretty blue and don't have a ""made in China"" sticker.But it still feels like a date gone bad..."
1,Same old round and round,"A friend gave me a copy of this debate, and it was underwhelming. Dr. Bahnsen brings up tired arguments that have been refuted before and Dr.Stein seemed either ill-prepared or simply wasn't all that into it. Apologetics at its finest."
1,"Very pretty, Very impractical","i'm a total sucker for beautiful books, and this is certainly beautiful. i was hoping to make the ribbon slippers featured on the cover, but can't find 1/2"" ribbon anywhere - and i live in a major metropolitan area! and even if i did, the 100 yards of ribbon would probably cost about $70. i doubt i'll ever make a single pattern from this one. wish i could return it."
3,Beautiful and Inspiring,For anyone who likes unusual and fine accesories this is the book! Well written and fabulous illustrations for the many inspiring projects. Beautiful in itself as a gift.
4,This is an awesome short but sweet EP,"I don't see how happy review warrior calls the two new tracks 'more of the same'; 'New Health Rock' displays TvOTR in a newer light. The title track is much more upbeat than anything they'd done at the time, with a hint of surf punk thrown into the mix. 'Modern Romance', cover of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' song, goes beyond the original version's guitar and drums instrumentation with electronic and ambient influence with truly great vocals.And while 'The Wrong Way' does work well into the mix, the band could easily have put maybe 'You Could Be Love', an LP outtake, on it for some more substantiality, but oh well, still a great extra couple tracks that really shows the evolution of the band, a necessity for fans."
4,"Gripping, unsettling little thriller","Despite a very disjointed start (in very poor quality - almost looks 16mm) the story comes together and all hell is let loose. Well acted, often edge of your seat situations - some of which are pretty disturbing, the film moves along at a brisk pace - perhaps too brisk as the clues leading up to the climactic confrontation are too rushed and justice dealt out too swiftly - though that's the only real fault I can find in an otherwise great film.Transfer quality is rough at the start as I mentioned but soon becomes satisfactory if not pretty good maybe due to different film stocks used."
3,not all its cracked up to be,"I purchased this film thinking it would be much like last house on the left except on a train, and it was. The biggest dissapointment about it though is that its not as gory and the few killings there are in the film just arent brutal. It is well filmed though and very watchable."
1,Unbearably stupid and ludicrously self-important,"""Night Train Murders"" might have worked as a nasty lowbrow Italian ripoff of ""Last House on the Left"" had the makers not attempted to obtain ""depth"" by shoving a class-warfare message into the movie front and center. Aw, those poor lower-class hoodlums: they were virtually FORCED by that nasty rich woman into raping and killing their victims! That's unbearably stupid, to say the least, as well as being far too similar to today's Hollywood movies that place a ""social message"" above everything else, no matter how ludicrous that message might be in relation to character, plot, or good-old-fashioned crass exploitation. It doesn't work in modern Hollywood movies, and it doesn't work in 1970s Italian exploitation movies. Don't waste your time with this one."
2,Night Train Murders,"I was disappointed in the movie particularly in light of the build up of being characterized as being on par with next ""Last House on the Left"". I was expecting a bit more graphic sexuality on par with say ""I Spit On Your Grave"". The movie seems to go out of its way not to show much skin. Why can't it be that if the villain asks the victim to undress that she actually undresses? Very little nudity except for one scene where one of the girls runs through the train bottomless. Nice butt shot though way too short! No boobs are shown for either girl. I do not recommend this movie if you're looking for a roughie."
2,Does not live up to the hype.,"I've heard comparisons to Last House, though this does not come close to the brutality of it's predecessor. Another irk about this film is that it is dubbed. I would rather hear the original language track and read subtitles than watch mush-mouth over-dubbing. Though Blue Underground has always been the benchmark of quality, they have let us down with this release, and I am a little upset over making a blind purchase on this one. Don't believe the hype. If you want extreme, watch Last House or I Spit On Your Grave."
1,Sick,"There is absolutely no reason to watch this film. I believe anyone that would own this film and watch it more than once, should be in therapy.It is not erotic, sexy or have any point whatsoever. In addition, the quality is very poor. Don't waste your time. This film will depress you and make you feel guilty for watching it. It's human behavior at it's very worst."
3,Love Motorhead but the quality of these mp3's is lacking,"Wish I could rate this collection higher but, the quality of the audio is yuck. Some tracks don't seem to be in stereo as well.... :("
4,Lemmy tell you somethin'...,"Not that they haven't made good music in the past twenty years, but I call their early years the essential stuff. So many good tracks here. If you only know ""Ace Of Spades"", the rest here is just as good. ""Killed By Death"" has got to be one of the best song titles ever. ""Bomber"" is classic. I could name every track, but it's all too kick ass to pick faves. Plus look at that cover pic. A good choice for your first or only Motorhead disc."
4,"Great, if you don't like the internet...","you can find most of this on google/bing/youtube without a problem. most of the visuals are helpful and filled in a couple blanks that i originally had when i was researching on my own online. if you prefer paper over the computer screen, then by all means this is a great manual. however, if you don't mind spending time online researching on your own, you won't be missing out on a lot. i still refer to it tho :)"
2,Not worth buying - in my opinion,"If you know how to applique, this one is not necessary. If you are looking to learn to applique, this book is truly not the best help for you. No inspiration, in my opinion ... sorry to say.I donated my copy to the local library."
3,OK - nothing to get torn up over,Obviously it requires a mat and that's the downfall of this game. It was OK.
3,The graphics get really annoying.,I'm probably older than the average player but I thought this would be fun. Turns out the graphics and sound effects get very annoying and distracting. The music is good but all those extra noises are annoying. The graphics are also terrible by Xbox standards. Overall we just played it a few times and now it hardly gets played at all.
1,Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3,"I bought a Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 2 before and like it very much. Therefore, I decided to buy another one. This game turned out to be a huge disappointment. The music in this game must have come from two and/or three decades ago. If you want to dance on the latest music, this is not the one to buy."
5,excellent vintage performance,I was at this show & several others that featured the giant country horns that summer. This show is as sick as I remember it being. I think the horns rock.
3,Phish + Horns = Not For Me,"The ""Live Phish"" series contains many excellent editions, but 19 is not one of them, for me personally. I want to emphasize that other Phish phans may (and do, as some reviews here show) feel differently.""Live Phish 19"" (2CDs, 28 tracks, 148 min.) is from a 1991 show in New Hampshire. CD1 (79 min.) starts off in a jazz-like club atmosphere, with a lot of short tracks, and the horns up front. Concert staples ""AC/DC Bag"" and ""David Bowie"" show a lot of energy, but sound very differently than one might expect with the horns. CD2 (69 min.) is much better, with an excellent Gumbo>Mike's Song>I Am Hydrogen>Weekabaug Groove, the latter with a blazing Trey guitar solo, the highlight of this concert. The Doors cover ""Touch Me"" works quite well too, no wonder since the original song also featured horns...In all, this is not a bad live set (is there such a thing with Phish?), but it's not my favorite. Check out instead for example Live 15 or Live 20, much better to my liking."
4,Don't Miss This One,"This is by far one my favorite Live Phish albums out there. Phish w/ the Giant Country Horns in NH. Probably the best version of the Landlady that I've ever heard (incredible guitar work). Buried Alive and Flat Fee really provide a nice jazzy groove. Sick versions of Bathtub Gin, Reba, Mike's Song, Gumbo, Tweezer and Suzy Greenberg. The Horns make this one more unique. Sound quality is great. Seriously, if you're a fan, and you don't have this one, get it."
5,Substitute for McCormick Salt 'n Spice,"While McCormick has discontinued this product, the company has graciously supplied the following ""recipe"" on their website [...] .Very close to the original blend, it can be tweaked to the user's preferences ...Salt 'n Spice BlendThis spice blend is similar to the discontinued Salt 'n Spice product. It contains salt, pepper, onion, garlic and celery seed.Makes 1/3 cup.Prep Time: 5 minutesINGREDIENTS:1/4 cup kosher salt2 tablespoons McCormick Perfect Pinch Salt Free Garlic Pepper Seasoning, McCormick Seasoned Pepper Blend or Lawry's Seasoned Pepper1 tablespoon McCormick Garlic Salt1 tablespoon McCormick Onion Powder1 1/2 teaspoons McCormick Celery Seed, crushedDIRECTIONS:1. Mix all ingredients until well blended.2. Store in tightly covered jar in cool, dry place."
1,Defective,One of the three bags in this set had an unsewn seam. It is now sitting by the sewing machine. Unless you have one of those I cannot recommend this product.
1,Fell apart 1st use!,First time I used it the larger bag had a big hole in the side when it came out of washing machine. All the items put inside had come out during the wash. I don't recommend as it's a waste of money.
1,Disintegrated during first use!,"I bought this to keep baby bibs and burp cloths together in the wash and was shocked to pull it out of the dryer only to find HUGE holes in the bag on its very first use! I took a picture of it to post in this review, but I don't see that feature.Save your money and do NOT buy this product."
2,Seams are letting loose,"I really want to like them. The zipper is protected, but the seam is starting to let go after only 3 uses."
5,Love it!,These work great and seem fairly durable. I bought them for washing bras and baby clothing and baby accessories. I'm very happy with my purchase.
4,What's Lost Can Be Found,"Finding the Christian life too complicated? Your zeal diminished? Your relationship with Jesus growing cold and predictable? First Love reminds you that what's been lost can be found - and tells you how! This practical tool can help you restore the fire and conviction of your first love for Christ by helping you to better understand His character, His Glory, and His love for you. If you want more love for Christ, pursue Him by practicing each of these every day. In every activity, in every contact, and in every thought, make Christ your focus. When you make Him your priority and love Christ with all your heart, soul, and strength, God is glorified."
5,Awesome,"The music is great, even though they even include tiny little sounds, some tracks are under 30 seconds long! But the cd's in a whole were spectacular"
5,Positively beautiful from Yasunori Mitsuda,"From playing the epic game for the original SNES, Chrono Trigger stands as one of the greatest PRG games next to the Final Fantasy series for SNES among other console systems. When playing the game, the music captures your attention as you play through the different emotions of the game and storyline throughout...Through intense battles, different horizons when traveling through time, and the sad times where a certain member departs from your party in the game, the music says something. Most people will often think that the music is just something played in a game or movie to simply ADD to the scenes, but I see that music like this, for a game in the older generation of gaming, is a perfect example of great music (sure technology has advanced so much, but the music for CT was made so well for the game on SNES). Add the soundtrack to your library of other music and make a special place for this one, cause it's a gem."
5,Forget the game. Buy this cd if you love music!,"Chrono trigger is one of the greatest role playing games ever created from the story to the graphics, but one thing stood out above everything eles. The sound. The chrono trigger soundtrack has some thing for every tast from rock to classical to new age. No matter what your preferences this Cd package has some thing for you. This 3 CD package plays all of the songs in the order that they appeared in the game. This set even has 2 songs that never made it to the finished version of the game. After hearing the music you will understand whay video game soundtracks are so popular in Japan."
3,Interesting,"A documentary about crop cirles around the world with interviews with the experts and eyewitness accounts. Also it covers ancient sites such as Stonehenge and the Pyramids and there connection with this amazing phenomena.Transfer 3/5Audio 3/5Extras 1/5Bonus material is a 12 minute interview featurette which they couldn't fit into the program. Transfer is good but the audio on this is out of sync by about a second which is very annoying to watch, I am amazed how this got through there quality control."
3,A little fragile.,My daugher is an avid rider and collector of Breyer horses. She loves this product. The look of it is wonderful. The only down side is that the item is a bit fragile. We already had to glue the one side back on and my daughter is not rough with it.
3,a little bit boring,"this biography begins in 1964,and it's the most boing part of his life. He only speeks of the elections and not about the man.It sometimes very boring, but there is a lot of information about bob."
2,Not impressed,"I consider myself pretty fluent in the realm of synth music, including ebm and industrial genres. And this release doesn't do anything for me. If this were 15 years old, I might give it a better review.Every song on this 2 disc CD is pretty much IN YOUR FACE aggressive ""anthem"" music...there's not much atmosphere at all or much thought to song structure. They each tend to borrow the same primitive arpeggiated bass lines from early Front 242 and FLA albums. In fact, there are a couple of tracks which blatantly copy FLA (ie, the ""I came to murder the world"" sample).On this album, the band seemed to have formed a reusable template from one song to crank out an entire album, because all of the songs sound alike. I'm not impressed!"
3,"Skin, Bones & All","You want all natural? With this product you get it.The quality and flavor is excellent-- after you pick out all of the bones and skin etc. At first glance it looks like catfood or bait, but looking past all of this there is excellent salmon caught in pristine Alaskan waters.I don't know that it is worth paying extra for something simply because it doesn't have salt unless you are on a salt-restricted diet. There are larger cans available at the same price in which you have to pick out the bones and skin.All-in-all. It's great, but know what you're getting."
5,delicious and good for you,"this is one of our main sources of proteins, with NO SALT ADDED! and yummy bones and skin left in!! thanks be to salmon!"
3,Too Many Bones,I thought this was like tuna fish but it is not. It is just like the taller cans of salmon with bones in it just a shorter version. The salmon is good if you can get pass the bones.What I do is de-bone seven cans at a time and freeze them because it is a headache to have to de-bone a can each and every time. Since this works for me I will continue to buy this product.
2,Not good,"Skin, bones and who knows what else. I bought this for my cat that is on a very special needs diet. She didn't like it and I sure wouldn't eat it either. Looked like something I would wipe off the sink and throw away. Lots of bones, soft, not firm and not at all what I expected. Not even for my cat."
5,won't find better,"this stuff is the real deal - awesome! will continue to keep buying. Some skin and bones are the way it should be for those that don't know. Low sodium, good for you! and great price! (compare to the crap in your local supermarket)"
4,Good Product,"I like the product for the healthy benefits of the Omega 3 oils, no salt and knowing that it is wild caught. My wife won't go near it due to the distinct fishy smell. You must be aware that the bones are in the product as well as the skin and fatty tissues. I remove the back bone, skin and fatty parts leaving the healthy parts."
5,Good stuff,"I try to eat salmon because it's supposed to be healthy when it's wild caught. I like that this is salt free, so I can add my own sea salt and use less. I called the company because I was worried about BPA in canned goods, but they said it is free of BPA, so that's good too. This is so much cheaper than fresh salmon. Nowhere near as good as fresh, but one of the better canned salmons I've eaten. I add some olive oil, apple cider vinegar, sea salt, and a few spices and I've really gotten to like it."
5,Low-Sodium Canned Salmon,"This is wonderful canned salmon with very, very low sodium. Can be used in a salmon salad or in patties, casseroles - great product. Hope Amazon continues to carry it regularly."
2,Yucks!,"Don't like this product. The salmon smells very strong, and I didn't like having to pick out all the bits of salmon skin and bones."
2,Not so good,"The salmon itself isn't that bad, but the meat had several questionable ""additions"", including some bony pieces. I found 6 big round bone fragments, probably from the fish's spinal cord. That's not something I want to chewing in my sandwich. Won't buy again."
2,GAG !!!,"there is NO pink in this salmon..it is cooked so much it is white...think a can of tune...but at the higher price you pay here for salmon...very hard to tell just what fish this is...you have to take it on faith i guess it is what they say it is.....ultra strong fish smell, not like fresh fish smells...friends across the hall will know you are having some old fish for dinner....the taste is a gag-fest-palooza.........the amount in the can is TINY, the weight is in the liquidthe salmon is sure not firm, it is mushy...add the skin and bones for more mush and more gag...this is a never buy again item...."
1,Not even fit for a cat to eat,"Full of crushed up little bones, spinal tissue, and skin. Impossible to consume. I've purchased canned salmon before that was quite excellent but this stuff is disgusting. I am stunned that anyone would give this anything other than a 1 star review. Do look at other 1 star reviews - especially the person who had to go to the doctor because of bones getting stuck in throat. Not only is this product inedible it is dangerous. That is no exaggeration."
1,Never got the merchandise,I placed the order on 12/6/09 and here it is 12/31/09 and I never received it. When I tried to track the order UPS does not have the tracking number in the database cause the number is bogus. for some reason I cannot contact the merchant to tell them what's going on so I have to dispute the charge on my credit card.
2,Dont buy this product if you dont want the WHOLE thing,"I bought this product and openend it up. To my horror the skin and bone were included. We have designated the whole 30 cans as cat food now. I designated 2 stars for the quality, it smelled good and looked good but I was pretty upset when it was unedible."
5,Great Healthy Salmon,Love this product. Low Salt and a solid product. The taste is great. Will continue to purchase abd refer to my friends.
1,Oops! My mistake: CONTAINS BPA! Goodbye to this product!,"UPDATE: BUT 5 stars GO TO AMAZON WHO ISSUED A CREDIT FOR MY LAST ORDER OF THIS PRODUCT! GOOD WORK AND THANK YOU AMAZON, I AM IMPRESSED!!! -Mo..........................................(change from 5 stars to 1) CANCEL THIS PRAISE OF THIS PRODUCT! It DOES contain BPA! -Mo..........................................This is *great* fish; no BPA, no added salt (*I* choose what and if salt is added), I LOVE lots of eatable fish bones (top calcium availability), congratulations Crown Prince and thank you for canning fish I can eat without BPA!"
1,Recipient didn't like it!,We sent a case to a couple of young people living on a tight budget -- I thought some canned protein would be a nice addition to thier pantry. I offered to send another case and was told 'no thanks'. They report that this product filled with small bones and cartiledge meaning there was wasted product and time wasted in cleaning it.
1,Bad,"If you like bones including the spine mixed in with your fish then you will like this product. I sure wish they would show you whats inside the can, because the label sure made it look better than the suprises I found when I opened it. It really looked like they put the whole fish through a grinder straight into the can."
3,pretty good salmon.,"This salmon is good stuff! But, you must be prepared for some bones and lack of salt. I have been eating Bear and Wolf brand--which is farm-raised salmon. It has some salt and no bones. I tried this Crown Prince brand because Costco was out of the Bear-Wolf. I ""do"" like this natural salmon, but not sure I would buy it again thru Amazon, as I bought a case of it. I like to eat this canned fish right outta the can, with olive oil and pepper--very good!!! Crown Prince is a good natural product. Maybe next time I will just buy a can or two."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this book!,This book is (I feel) one of the reasons I did even remotely well in level four Spanish. It conjugates EVERYTHING and gives helpful phrases on the bottom of each page. It is easy to use and exceeded my expectations. I whole heartily recommend this book to any student.
5,The best spanish book fo high schoolers,Hello. My name is Cara and I am taking Spanish 1B and I am in the 9th grade. Right now we are studing verbs and stem changing verbs and conjungation and this book has helped me alot. It has full bold print letters and all of the conjungation needed to get you through Spanish. so hurry up- and get it .
4,Just replacing existing reference material,"I use Spanish regularly for work, so I picked this book up as a reference source for some of my communications to Latin America because I never actually studied Spanish despite being fluent."
2,Not as good as I had thought,"I thought this was a great book until I cross-referenced the other verbs in the back of the book. The pages listed for the model verbs are not all acurate. In fact most are very misplaced. The 501 verbs are correct as far as I know but the others in the book can be misleading. I am now having to cross-reference these verbs with a verb conjugator. I am not saying that this book hasn't been helpful. It is helpful in leaning many of the basic Spanish verbs, especially the irregular ones, but after 501, you are kind of own your own."
5,A Great Reference Book,I found 501 Spanish Verbs to be very helpful. It is very thorough in providing all the tenses for the verbs. What I also found especially helpful is that additional related vocabulary words are listed at the bottom of each page.This book is a good reference tool.
2,A completely overrated book only for basic needs,"I have to be one of the few reviewers who have felt compelled to rain on 501 SV parade and its rave accounts, but it just seems fair with respect to the overlooked competition. The 501 is clear but basic and repetitive. Indeed, it will serve the needs of those students who need to be shown ""ad nauseam"" (from the teacher's point of view...) how to conjugate a large list of -AR verbs with no internal stem change. Other students, faster, more curious and with more analytical skills, will need to conjugate a much larger variety of irregular verbs and will request much more bang for their buck. Those will benefit a whole lot more from the best in the field, ""Spanish Verb Manual"", from the excellent Passport Books series, by Alfredo González Hermoso. It is genuinely complete, with 5000 verbs, compact, clear, visually attractive, with many regional uses and expressions. This one is a must."
4,A great basic tool,"A great, informative reference, full of extras besides just the lists of tenses. It could use a little clearer layout. Definitely for the desk at home, it is exhaustive in its thoroughness and way more info than a beginner needs.I suggest they produce a smaller version without some of the arcane tenses and info. It would be quicker and easier to use for beginners, and easier to travel with."
3,Really Important Information you need to know,"While this book is really extensive, and I have it for both French and German too, it is important to note the title: 501 Spanish verbs. Unlike other books which give a more limited full description of verbs and a long list of ones with cross-references, it only has these 501 verbs. If you need something that covers all the bases, I recommened the Oxford or Teach Yourself Spanish Verbs book. You'll find that you won't get frustrated when a verb is missing, and that a comparatively pocket-sized verb book is a better choice."
5,Extremely Useful,"This book is great! In addition to providing the fourteen simple and compound tenses of 501 Spanish verbs, it explains the reasons for, and formation of the various tenses. It has appendices that include common expressions, drills and tests, weather expressions and more. I have learned much from this book and use it often."
3,Buy Spanish Verbs instead for portability.,"Buy this if you have difficulty with fine print or if you will use Spanish in your home country only. Otherwise, buy ""Spanish Verbs"" instead! (Same author, Christopher Kendris, also a Barron's book, just smaller.) ""Spanish Verbs"" only has 301 verbs, but lists over 1,000 verbs in the back with the page number for how it's conjugated, so really everything you need is there. The print is much smaller in Spanish Verbs, unfortunately.But here's the thing: ""501 Spanish Verbs"" weighs 1 lb 12 oz. ""Spanish Verbs"" weighs 8 oz. and is much smaller. I own both, and have decided to get rid of my 501 Spanish Verbs because it takes up too much room on my shelf and is too big to take to Costa Rica or Mexico with me. It's when I travel that I really need to review verb conjugations, so I was thrilled to discover the smaller book!"
3,Not all there,I am learning Spanish and my biggest gripe is on 3 or 4 occassions I have gone to this book to see what a verb meant only to find it was not listed...not the derivative and not the infinitive (and keep in mind these were verbs I found in introductory learning Spanish books).
5,An Excellent Reference Source,"I would like to recommend this book to any student who had ventured past the simple Spanish tenses. It can be used as a grammar guide on its own and is immensely helpful to prepare one for rigorous examinations in high school and college. My favorite features are the sections in the back, such as the ""Verbs Used in Idiomatic Expressions"" and ""Popular Phrases, Words, and Expressions for Tourists."""
5,Spanish Verb Bible,This book is a MUST for any serious student of the language. You will never find a better source for looking up and learning the many tenses of any verb. GREAT SERIES.
5,Must-have for everyone,"This book is one of the best books to get whether learning Spanish or reviewing it. Spanish verbs are always so confusing for learners but this book makes it so much easier to understand. I was in Puerto Rico for a time and found this book to be very helpful. I didn't have much training in the language but this book helped so much and when I left we could speak the language without difficulty. I recommend this for all those learning Spanish, whether they are beginners or are majoring in the language."
5,One of the most helpful spanish books ever written,"This book is so awesome, I'm a high school student currently studying spanish and this book has been the factor in passing and failing many tests. It is a very simple layout and totally fool proof. Any one studying spanish should own a copy I've had the book since 8th grade and I'm still using it frequently as a senior in my 5th year of spanish"
5,One of the best tools to learn and affirm your Spanish!,"I'm an American (native English speaker) living, studying and working in Barcelona, Spain. This book is instrumental in affirming my learning process of Spanish. I study 15hrs a week and use the book every single day! If you want a comprehensive guide that helps explain the 14 tenses of Spanish in comparison to the 6 in English and a listing of conjugated Spanish verbs to help you form them, remember them and understand this is the book to own!"
5,Very helpful and easy to use.,"I bought this book for my advanced spanish class and it has been more than used, it's been almost a necessity. Now, that is a bit extreme, but I do highly recommend this book to anyone needing help in any tense in spanish, or anyone who just wants to know more about how to speak in the correct tense. This book is very easy to use due to the fantastically simple format. This book has come in handy several times already, and I've only had mine less than a month. This is a very helpful book and I would suggest anyone buy it who are planning to go to higher level spanish."
5,A Must Have,I ordered this book because others in the class have it. It is a wonderful resource for learnimg Spanish. I recommend it.
4,If you need to know many conjugations buy this book,This book is very good because it conjugates thousands of Spanish verbs. It has 501 verbs conjugated and then hundreds in the back of the book in which the 501 stand as models. The verbs also have expressions that goes with them for more usage of the verb. It's a great book.
5,"A godsend, for sure.","For any level Spanish student, for any Spanish teacher, no doubt this book is your bible! In fact, any '501 [language] Verbs' is a must for us language learners."
2,"Useless, utterly useless","This book has 501 verbs because it contains hundreds of regular verbs conjugated in an identical fashion over and over and over again. It would suffice to have pages of the irregular verbs, which often aren't even very irregular, and then have lists of verbs that correspond to each conjugation scheme. This was an unforgivable waste of my money."
1,Product WONDERFUL!!! Price HORRIBLE!!!,I am in love with this sugar-free Chai. However I will still trek to Walmart or other large retailer to purchase it for about $3/32oz container. This online retailer must be insane if they think people should pay this price. Make the trek folks!
5,A must buy,"Brilliant composition of Om Namah Shivaya in 9 ragas. Her soulful voice transports the listener to a medatative place, and one truly feels Shiva within."
3,Good color...,"I loved the shade, but wasn't quite as comfortable as what I'm used to-- Capezio. Maybe a different kind from Danskin would feel better."
4,good fit,"Looked good, fit great but I would have liked them to be little more spandex like. I would recommend them."
2,Too Dark,Too dark for light toast. I was expecting something just a bit darker than nude. Unfortunately had to return. I will look at Capizio.
3,Very comfortable but a different color than ordered,"The ""tan"" runs really red - looks like almost a costume color, not something to wear with just normal clothing."
3,"Great texture, but runs a bit small, inconsistent color","I was hoping the colors between the Microfiber Danskin and these Compression tights would be the same, but I guess not.This Light Toast color is more red than the Light Toast in the Microfiber tights. I also wish I went a size up, but they're still comfortable.The sheen on these are pretty great though.I'll be using these as regular nylons versus for dance, because the waist band doesn't roll down like other tights. If you are going to use these for dance, and are around my size, I do recommend ordering a size B versus an A.For reference I'm 5'1 and between 110-115lbs."
3,No size information,"This site gives no size information for these tights--plenty of other items, but not this. Cannot buy without the info."
2,contains preservative,"I love natural products, thats why I go for homeopathic formulas, and I really do not understand why some homeopathic companies use chemical preservatives in their formulas?, Boiron is one of these companies and their chestal cough syrup includes chemical preservatives, I think they don't understand the preferences of their customers."
1,PAINFUL!!!,"A few years ago, I tore up the seat that shipped with my Trek 4500 mountain bike (I foolishly tried extreme mountain biking!). I considered the Trek stock seat to be fairly comfortable. I replaced the torn stock seat with this one. I have HATED it since!This seat LOOKS great, but FEELS AWFUL! Even just a 30 minute ride causes my rear end to hurt into the next day. It is a narrow saddle with very stiff pads. Although I do much of my riding standing up, it still causes my rear end to hurt a lot. I feel my butt bones digging through onto the narrow saddle. I am a bit heavy (215 lbs) and probably require a wider seat. Beware - this seat is very uncomfortable!"
4,surreal and original,"Ive heard their 2nd 3rd and 4th albums and thankfully for this one they've abandoned a lot of the complexity in their arrangements for the sake of shorter less prog rock songs. the lyrics are surreal and mysterious and sometimes melancholic. the music is a mix of psychedelic, krautrock and glam. Through the use of chugging synthesizers and keyboards on some songs they add a unique edge to the raw and hard rockin music. And the use of piano, flute, and sax on some songs add even more color. The musicianship is quite good except for the drummer who's a bit weak. Songs are all good. a very unique album and one of my favorites. check out the song ""Moment."""
1,A HORRIBLE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I do not recommend this book!!! I took so long to finish it. Do not read it. You will fall asleep in minutes!!!!!!!
3,good quality,"Photo is great quality, poster is smaller than normal, it took a long time to receive from shipper."
3,Don't Be Fooled!,This is not the original Uriah Heep of early material. Don't make the same mistake I did and buy this. This is all later material from 1977-1991 and does not include any of the early albums
4,"beautiful, intelligent love story","I really enjoyed this film. The films was fluid, engaging, and realistic. It is not only a love film to two people, but also to Hungary."
2,"more skin, less barins","this anime is surely pretty much not much in way of charachters or plot. The charachters either cut out (fighters who want to be become the best) are stale (the dumb naive big breasted protagonist) even more stale. This volume at least shows more skin and raciness, but the fighting scenes that could be furious are hampered down by cliche'd dramatic still shots or choppy edits."
4,Always Excellent!,"Received in good condition.Always a delicious treat.Reminds me of my first visit to the US at age 11.Thanks,CW"
3,Nice,"I am very careful when I spritz this on me. Usually I just use very little because it promises to be a little bit overbearing if you spritz too much of it. I add it on whenever I use my Flowerbomb Edt spray and I've been told the smell is amazing, however I still cannot distinguish which perfume they are talking about since I'm wearing 2 totally different fragrances :) Somewhere in my mind, I can't help but think it's perhaps a unisex perfume."
5,A Pleasant Experience,I had a very pleasant experience with my purchase of Eau Des Merveilles by Hermes. The perfume smells wonderful and arrived sooner than anticipated. The price of the perfume was much better than in the department store and came right to my door. This was my first purchase on Amazon and it was great. I would not hesitate to order again.
3,It's Hermes.....,"So I got this because it got great reviews AND because it's Hermes. Honestly, I can't tell whether it actually smells good because the fact that it's a Hermes product just makes it really cool. It smells totally different from Pleasures, Lovely, Romantic, etc. I guess I'll have to ask one of my girlfriends what they think--without letting them know that it's Hermes."
4,likeable,"This stuff is fresh and clean, modern and vaguely unisex. Long- lasting and a tiny spritz should be enough, therefore a reasonable value. I find this more suited to office wear as opposed to special occasion or romance.Is it extremely unique? Well, no, only pleasant. But enjoy."
2,Complicated,"Very neat product. Was compicated, hard to do and use. Hard to put sheets together and line up. Make sure you calibrate your printer, the instructions are tough too. I dont think ill buy again"
1,Fundamentalist Fantasy,"Anyone who states that this book represents a balanced view of history, or of any ""facts"", should have their head examined. This is Young Earth Creationism at its worst. It claims, as fact, so many fantasies of the creationist movement that I lost track counting. If you are a fundamentalist bible thumper who feels compelled to continue the lie of YEC, by all means this is the book for you. If you are a Christian who actually thinks deeply about theology and history, and want to teach your children real history, do yourself a favor and pass on wasting money on this tripe."
3,Epsilon - self-titled (Bacillus),"This self-titled CD was the German progressive band's first lp, originally released in 1971. Epsilon put out just three albums, but this first effort was considered by most fans as well as critics to be their best work. Most memorable tracks include are easy to spot - like ""Every Day's Pain"", ""Between Midnight"", the well-played ""Paint It Black Or White"" (song had good arrangement with interesting lyrics - a Stones cover - but Epsilon's version is nearly a complete different song altogether) and the surprise closer - the boogie-like ""Hurry Up"". A decent pick - however definitely an acquired taste."
2,A great book not particularly about the heart,"I bought this book thinking it would help me with opening my heart. I didn't find it helpful in that regard, despite the subtitle.There are many books out there with ""heart"" in the title, including several by the Dalai Lama's publishing company. In general,they turn out to be overviews of spiritual practices, which was the case with Cynthia's book. A lot of the time, the writer seems to feel that clearing out the negativity and learning to meditate has to come first. Perhaps it does. Nonetheless, I was disappointed with the Wisdom Way of Knowing, which was a much more accurate than the subtitle."
3,Wisdom Way of Knowing,"A good reminder that the oldest practices for spiritual growth---meditation, prayer, mindful work, chanting, etc---remain effective in reawakening spirit."
5,One of my absolute favorites,Everything I have made is mouth watering. Simple yet melt in your mouth. I crave this book and the recipes in it. I love the page numbers-very clever! The chocolate cream and coconut cream pie recipes are worth the price of this amazing cookbook.
4,Unique instrumentation,"Matson Jones is like Rasputina mixed with influences from riot girl bands. The vocals are melodic and not irritating like Sleater Kinney yet with the same energy and spunk. The cello/violin instrumentation add a distinct sound. The unpolished, garage aspects give it a punky edge but the vocal harmonies and classical string instruments offset the angst."
3,"cracklin', baby!","ah, matson jones...i first saw them open for the czars back in the hell days when i lived in denver...one of the little bright spots, i must say. why? because these girls ROCK their cellos, that's why. and the rhythm section is not bad either, just frenzied and frenetic enough. they sing together with a strange, almost flat, scream-y kind of harmony that gets under your skin and forces the bumps up. this is their first full-length and it is beautifully unconventional and will make you shake your rump."
2,could be better,"An interesting disk instrumentally given the reliance on dual (duel) cellos. However, vocals are typical contemporary atonal shrieking."
5,Bloody Hell,[...] It so how amazing how well they made quidditch a video game. Each team has it's special abilility (like griffindor has the wealsy wangler). They have all the teams including bulgaria except Ireland [...]. you play the hogwarts cup and the world cup until you win. You can also play 2-player. Best game ever. Hriday Kemburu
5,Game for anyone!,"If you like a racing game or a high speed game this is for you. I don't actually think anyone will dilike this game because it is the best game ever!!!! I love playing this game every day trying to unloclk quiditch cards, stadiums, brooms, and teams. I think you should buy this game (...). Some matches can go from 5 minutes to an hour, because it depends how fast you git the snitch meter up. You also can do special moves such as the Wronski Feint and Wealsy Wangler. You should ask for this game or your parents should get it for your birthday or something. Hk"
4,fun fun fun,Well its is finally here the game of all wizard and witch fans. This game is rally awesome. i have loved it soo far. It is easy for the kids but if you want to be challenged you can choose certain modes which are names of broomsticks. The school quidditch cup is pretty easy to get but once you get to the wrodl cup it starts to get a little harder and a lot of fun. This game is a must buy.
3,bought as a present for a foster child,I really don't know a lot about this game as I bought it as a Christmas present.
1,Quidditch World Trash,I do enjoy the Harry Potter Books and Movies but the games all of them espesially this one is just horrible. There is only one thing to do no variety. if that is what you want go ahead and spend your money there is nothing i can do but warn you not to it is just another wasted $30 bucks. This game is not something to spend your hard eaned money on i recommend Morrowind for the older ones it truly has to be the best game i have ever seen letting you or your child do almost anything! you should check it out and it is reasonably priced!
2,Loved this game,"But unfortunately it doesn't come for anything but Xbox anymore. It was a lot of fun to play, but since it won't work on my newer system, I had to return it."
1,Not supported by XBox 360,"My daughter really wanted this game even though it is old (some nostagia involved). Most XBox games have an update to make them compatible with XBox 360, but this game does not. VERY DISAPPOINTING!"
4,View from a Mom with Boys,"We gave it as a gift to a 9 year old, who has really enjoyed it. He was able to pick up how to play it very quickly. The 12 year old 'beat' the game the first time through, but thoroughly enjoyed himself, and will play it again. He described it as similar to the Sports video games, but with less options in selecting teams. Our 6 year old was playing it proficiently within about 10 minutes. It can be played against the computer, or against another opponent. For myself, the scenes whirl past too quickly, and I get dizzy. But, it doesn't bother the boys, and they seem to enjoy it. They all said that competition against the computer was minimal...the best is against another human player. I suspect it will not be one of the long term favorites, but a good one to pull out when a friend comes over."
3,Above Average....,"This CD was, cute. The girls can sing, the beats are ok for the most part but they came out at a time when people could not take another female group. Also there is one girl in the group (not sure which one) who tries to sing like CoKo of SWV (stop that). Not the most original piece of work but you'll find a song or two you like."
4,Good start,"A good and steady soul debut. The lead singer's voice is ok and fine but no particularly recognizable and strong. Some songs are very catchy like Day and Night , Stood up or Hater. They have good (break-)beats and everything is ok - just all in all it lacks a bit of individualism."
4,for those who like girl groups,well sisqo's discovered these 4 hotties check em out not my thang but i recognize good talent when I hear it usual girl stuff for them mainly.
5,Why weren't they a bigger act? :-),This group can sang. They were (are?) fantastic and I can't understand how they weren't bigger when they can harmonise like they do and their music was as tight as it was.Everyone remembers Single For The Rest Of My Life (which to me is the stand out song on the cd - and my favourite). They sounded like Jody Watley on that song. The rest of the cd is choc-full of great R&B; sounds and beautiful vocals. Not Letting Him Go and Unladylike are my two other favourite songs.I hope these girls come out with more music because I think they are very talented. The cd has a few multimedia bonuses on it but you must take a listen to this if you are a true R&B; fan and if you like strong vocals and great music. There is a good mix of slow and fast jams so everyone should find something they like here.
4,Excellent Debut,"Good Songs:Holla At Me, Oh No She Didn't, Single For The Rest Of My Life, Hater, Uh Uh Uh Uh, No No No, The Way We Do, Unlady Like Not Letting Him Go, Message 2 UOK Songs:Day And Night, Beutiful YouBad Songs:The Way We Do Part 2, Dat And Night RemixFirst Thing I Thaught, Just What We Need Another Girl Group, They Always Lose Members Or Break Up. Then I Heard The Album And The Way Their Vocals Mesh Beutifully Over The Good Production Is A Great Thing. Congrads And Big Ups, It's Just Too Bad The Album Has Only Sold 193,000 Copies In The Last Month. Comments? Instant Message Me, Murdaincstartrak."
2,Not As Good As I Thought They Would Be,"I remember buying this awhile back when I first heard their single ""Day and Night"" remix on the radio and in the clubs. I thought to myself this joint is off the chains! Well after buying the cd and listening to it, I thought, ""not good, what a waste."" No wonder they were a one hit wonder."
3,great Pics,A collection of great pictures and stories of the boys travels and their experiances. not 100% accurate but still a good book
1,And to think that we thought that we'd never be friends.,I'm still waiting for the book to arrive. I ordered 4 books from Amazon on the same day. The other three books arrived within a week of each other. Still waiting for this one. I'm starting to wonder if I've paid something for nothing.
5,These are a smart buy...,"I wasted money on disposables for a year and have since used these on my 13 month old. I am quite happy with every aspect of this diaper; they are trim (and fashionable), dry fast, do not leak (even at night!), and are less expensive than other AIOs.I am looking forward to putting my next baby in these, from day one."
3,OK diapers for the price,"I bought these diapers for my 17 month old daughter. I'm not overly impressed with them so far. They are nice and absorbent and easy to use. The extra-long, attached insert is easy to use...you just double it over in the diaper. They wash and dry nicely.However, there are some things I do not like about these. They are rather bulky and I don't see how they would work well with a newborn. I also discovered that they will leak depending on what clothing my daughter is wearing. If she's wearing a one piece outfit or sleeper, they do not leak. If she is wearing something like jeans that pull up in the crotch area...the diaper will leak out of the sides. The leg openings don't seem to be fitted enough.I wouldn't buy any more of these. I like the Bumgenius, Happy Heiny's or Haute Pockets much better."
3,Diapers run a little smal,"I just bought a few of these diapers to complete our cloth diaper set. We also use Happy Heiny's and are very happy with them. The Baby Love diapers work great at night, they are very absorbent. But they do run a bit small. They are advertized as fitting up to 35 pounds. My son is 25 pounds and these are really tight on him. I highly doubt they will fit him until he is potty trained. I would be happier if this company just made different sizes."
4,"Good Product, but assembly required","The package arrived in 2 boxes. I was sort of surprised that I had to assemble the whole machine to the cart. I am not the hardware kind of person, but had to make trips to Home Depot and buy some tools and managed to put this thing together. The manual that came with leaves a lot to be desired. For the amount of money they are charging, I would have thought that they could atleast provide a nice color manual. Also, they could provide detailed instructions and some assembly tools. Regardless, the final product is excellent. Two pulls and the honda burst into life. In about a year, I will know how goos this pump is. New machines always work well."
2,Won't hold air,"This double-end bag came with the Title ""Double-Trouble Bag Stand"". I completed assembly of the stand and hung the bag at around 11:30 p.m. I went a few rounds with the bag and went to sleep. When I got up, there was only about 20% of the air remaining in the bag. I don't know about you, but if I have to fill up the bag every time I use it......it's no good. Buyer beware.P.S. I do see what the review above is talking about when it mentions the plastic labels and bare-handed practice. However, I wrap my hands before hitting and it solves that problem. The bag is still no good though."
4,Works good in most applications,"I used this product to fill cracks in my cement driveway. It worked good in most places but anywhere that the concrete was not completely clean and free of any grit or other contamination, the product eventually came up out of the crack and did not adhere. This was the only reason that I did not give it five stars. Product was very easy to apply with the squeeze bottle and application nipple spout."
2,This stuff looks almost white in color !,"My wife tells me that there's no-way that I'm filling the cracks our driveway with this ugly colored stuff. It looks white and not any where near the color of cement.So --- I'm going to put foam rope in the cracks and shove it down about 3"". Then I'm going to use this easy-to-apply filler, so that it comes a quarter inch below the top of the cement. Then I plan to put a quarter inch of ready-mix cement on top of this stuff. Hopefully this stuff will soak into the ready-mix and not look so bright in color."
1,BEWARE: FORMALDEHYDE!!,"I don't know if this product does what it says it does, but that is not my point here: This items contains formaldehyde which is toxic!This is from Wikipedia: 'In view of its widespread use, toxicity and volatility, exposure to formaldehyde is a significant consideration for human health.[5] On 10 June 2011, the US National Toxicology Program has described formaldehyde as ""known to be a human carcinogen"".'There were no warnings of this on the product page, which is very irresponsible of the company and Amazon! I was going to use it to repair cracks in our patio area which is a part of our dog yard. Since most dogs tend to 'taste' things they could've sick, or worse, died from this."
3,silicone covers,"they are practical and got here quickly. they are not as thick as the one from Nintendo, in fact one has torn already. When in place it is not easy to replace the batteries, removing the cover is how it was torn."
4,"Bob Acri, ""Timeless"".","The Cd itself was in excellent condition,but the jewel case was broken. I don't think the case broke during shipping. Items should be inspected before shipping. Thank you."
2,could have been better,the only thing good about this dvd is the feature model who is the best looking lady on the whole dvd this dvd could have been better if they featured more beautiful models in exotic locations in short it could have been better if the people producing it had more imagination.
3,hmm....,"like the discs...here is the problem i see- after recording 24 minites the disc promts you to finalize it, what happens to the last 6 minites? so if you do what the disc says you are cutting off 12 minites of recording time. Second, one disc i had totally became defective after using almost the whole thing. the camera gives you a message that says it is a bad disc. i lost all my footage and i wasnt happy about that."
3,singing baseball,"works great, but was expecting more phrases or songs than what it actually had. There were only three. As an English teacher here in Korea, it was a great ice breaker for some of the shy students."
3,Not for Little Ones,"We love Shrek in our house. I purchased this thinking he would love it but it really scared him and he does not scare easily. They did a story called Shreckcorcist. This was not in the description or on the case. The Pinocchio character's head spun around, he threw up and levitated over the bed etc.... It was just weird. We will put this one away for when he is MUCH older."
1,Too scary!,So excited to get this on Netflix and watch it and it turned out to be a disappointment. There was a story with Gingy that his girlfriend turned into a zombie and brought hundreds of her friends to kill Gingy. This scared my 8 year terribly this afternoon. I should have watched it first. SO glad he stopped watching at that point because from reading the reviews...apparently the movie got scarier as it progressed. Sure hope he doesn't have nightmares tonight. :( Very disappointed.
1,Mad,"I loves Shrek!! but this was a disappointment to me if i can send it back i would, very upset, not a good dvd, came on time just didnt like this at all."
2,There is no portuguese subtitles as annouced.,"The DVD description on the site annouces a Region code 1 and Portuguese subtitles.But, there is no portuguese subtitles as annouced.The kids did not understood the dialogs (neither spanish)."
1,horrible,"was skeptical when I bought this, I had reason to be. bad acting to say the least, with cheap & poor effects, bad editing as well. It was a gamble purchase and I lost"
4,Metaphorically and lyrically beautiful,"I loved this book. I can't explain it. I just loved it. I drank up every word. The images weren't beautiful, the view of the future was dismal, but after the first chapter it turned into a series of stunning metaphors that spoke to my soul.I was totally unable to follow the plot. The ending was devoid of meaning for me. The relationship between the hero and his girlfriend made no sense. The characters seemed to shift in and out of personalities paragraph by paragraph.But I totally loved this book and highly recommend it. No clue why..."
5,This is a Great book for all Broncos fans. A++++,"This book (Biography of John Elway) shows not only History of John Elway, but also of his Teamates and other Players around the NFL . This book is loaded with Players, Coaches, and the Owner of the Denver Broncos."
1,"Garish, oversynthed pagode","Whoa! The guest artist list is great, and these musicians are the real deal, but ""retro-samba"" is exactly what this album is *not.* This is an unfortunate example of bad ""pop"" pagode -- slicker than the Fonz's DA, and (unfortunately) as unappealing.Try these titles instead: ""Brazil -- Roots -- Samba"" (Rounder); ""Casa de Mae Joana"" (Blue Jackel) and ""This is Samba!"" (2 volumes, on Rounder) for a taste of honest-to-goodness samba at its best. Singer Beth Carvalho's early albums (1960s-mid 1970s) are terrific examples of down-home samba, too. (Look for her ""Serie Raizes do Samba"" compilation.....)And then there's the peerless Paulinho da Viola: try his ""Bebadosamba"" and/or its live companion, ""Bebadachama."" They're both stunners."
2,Not Very Handy,"So-so reception, not as good as our Sony radios. Incredibly difficult to setup - illogical. Hard to do anything without half-hour reading the manual. If manual is lost, this radio could be nearly useless. Will avoid Kaito in future."
2,Ouch!,"I bought this radio two years ago. Today, for at least the tenth time (I have a few other radios that I rely on), I had to turn it off because the sound was so tinny, it hurt my ears and sensibility (I was listening to Irish traditional music on FM). If you like to listen to music, through the speaker, I would suggest you buy a bigger radio. (Earphones are nice with this unit, but BEWARE of the ridiculously sensitive volume wheel.) I have bigger radios, with better sound, and they are still very portable. Unless you really need ""very small,"" this radio is limited in its versatility.By the way, although this radio has seen pretty LIGHT USE (see other effects of decrepitude below), the silver-gray ""paint"" has worn off the corners to reveal a darker plastic.UPDATE: Antennae became unsoldered from its housing, fell out.Mystery piece of plastic found in computer bag since identified as protective window for this radio's LCD display."
2,"Loved it, until....","I initially loved this radio. Would have given it 5 stars before my problems occurred. The first problem I had was when the plastic protective piece that covers the digital display fell off. Not too big of a deal. The second issue I had is after I would use the headphones and would take the headphone jack out, there would be no sound from the radio. I had to repeatedly jam the jack in and out and jog the internal bridge so it would make contact again and allow sound through the speakers. It got to the point where I couldn't get sound at all. My attempts to repair resulted in bigger problems. I've had the radio roughly 6 months. I wrote Kaito detailing my problem in hopes they would provide a replacement at some sort of discount. I am still waiting to hear back from them after 5 days. Will update review if they make contact."
1,A Major Disappointment,"After one year of very light use, this radio is going in the garbage.PROS:Small and light weight.Sleep timer.CONS:FM - My Sony CD/AM/FM locked onto stations that the Kaito KA11 couldn't even detect.AM - The AM band completely stopped working.Antenna - Pull it out at your own risk. It's poorly engineered & flawed design.Batteries - How could such a little radio go through batteries so fast?Controls - The 'up' button didn't always work, and was getting worse.I'm a radio nut. This radio was such a disappointment"
4,Need more in the series.,"I wish there was a whole series of these books, since there are thousands of church hymns and choruses as well. So there is plenty of material to write about. I guess there were only two books and that was it."
5,tempus fugit,This book is amazing piece of amercian history. New York history. Frozen moments of ordinary people and their enviroment. Really must have one...
3,DDR - Dance and Workout,This is the best winter (or rainy day) video game you could ask for - even though my daughter is staring at the TV - she is getting a great workout and it's improving her dexterity and eye coordination. Certainly keeps the brain working.
4,"Good fun, even for beginners","This game features a good selection of songs. Like all installments of DDR, everyone from beginners to experts can choose a level of play suited for them and work up to more difficult settings. A little effort goes a long way in unlocking the full musical selection."
5,Another great DDR game,"This is another great installation of DDR. There are a lot of cool songs on it. My whole dorm's been playing it nonstop. The only thing I don't like is that, unlike prior versions, you have to play single player to unlock new songs. Some of the single player modes are nearly impossible, so there are songs that I'll never get. Also, single player just isn't as much fun. Overall it's great though."
3,A bit disappointed,"The main reason our family looks forward to fall is because there will be a new DDR game released. DDR Extreme 2 is somewhat of a disappointment. Yes, there are some new songs. But I am getting sick of so many of the same songs from previous games ""re-mixed"" for the new DDR games. People who play a lot of DDR are craving new songs to play. So why can't we get a version with ALL completely new songs? The other thing we hate: the work you have to go thru to even unlock all of the songs. Who cares about buying clothes & outfits for the dance characters?! We turn off the characters anyway - they're too annoying to leave on. I wish the game was the same format as the older DDR games like Max 2 & Extreme but with ALL NEW songs! I agree with one of the other reviewers - let us all vote for the music we want. This is not at all one of my most played DDR games. DDR Mom in Illinois"
4,Variety and fun too,"I have the first version of this game, but got the newer one, which is even more fun. It has several more challenges, levels, styles, and variety. I haven't yet tried them all, but it's worth the $$ because of the different games and players you get. Plus you can unlock different musi and play with your hands too. Both my 13-yr old son and I are enjoying the exercise we get with it, and this version is very similar to the arcade one, so we practice and then go to the arcade - and can get our monies worth!"
3,DDR... but tedious.,"It may have a few decent steps and a couple improvements (you don't need to go back to the main menu after three songs in free play mode,) but the game has one near killer flaw- they changed the core gameplay from focusing on arcade style vs. play and free play to a more mission oriented ""Dance Master"" mode. The tedious mission gameplay, combined with the barrage of menus required to just get a new song might give the impression the software is an office spreadsheet rather than a dancing game. I rarely write reviews... but this game needs another disclaimer. ""Warning- Game may cause extreme tedium"""
4,ddr is great fun,"i love this game its lots of fun and a great work out if you like to ""dance"" and want to loose weight i recommend this game all the ddrs cause the songs will get played out and variety is anyway"
3,"It's fun, but...","I got this for my kids (ages 7 & 9) as a Christmas present. They have had fun with it, but it IS NOT user friendly when it comes to setting it up when you are picking what you want to dance to. It takes some getting used to, and I still don't have the timing right when it comes to matching the time you step to when the screen tells you to. The pads seem to be working ok, just make sure you have room for them- I got 2. I geuss all in all, it's OK. Don't know if I would spend the money again for the game and 2 dance mats..."
4,fun game,"This game is really fun. It is as you would except DDR games to be like. However, I wish the game contained more songs that I recognize."
1,WRONG GAME...,"So I ordered this game about a week ago. I got it in the mail last night and when I opened it up, the casing was DDR Extreme 2. However when I opened up the case there was no DDR Extreme 2. It was just DDR Extreme. I'm quite pissed!"
4,Pretty Awesome,"The game itself I have played before and it is fun and has great music choices. My favorite DDR game. Unfortunately I can't play it at my house due to the pad I bought not working but that has nothing to do with the game.Really fun, good work out if you can play it on a hard/fast enough mode. Very entertaining and fun to play with friends and family even. Easily recommended."
4,DDR Extreme2,"I like the workout section of this game better than the newer games because I can choose my own music as I go along. The pre-set is a good idea, but I'd rather pre-set my own music. I also don't particularly like the music in the newer workout sections of the newer games."
3,Ehh...,I got this game during the summer expecting it to be great fun. Well...it caught my interest for a few weeks then I just got bored with it. I'd only recomend it to people who do not get bored easily.
2,A let down,"Basically, this is a book of essays about weblogs, many of which I had read before, as well as read blurbs on other weblogs which linked to these essays. I felt rather let down by the book, as I had the impression that these would be heretofore unseen works by the First-Gen Blog Darlings.Perhaps the only people who'd get anything out of it would be rank newbies who just want to know what all this blogging business is about. People who are already ""in the know"" should probably steer clear and get ""Small Pieces Loosely Joined."""
1,Read them online instead.,"It's not that the essays in this book are bad. Most of them are either entertaining, interesting or illuminating. But they're ALL availble online, and are frankly better reads online, with links and design and context. Yes, the book presents a new context by presenting the articles together, but the only context provided is Rebecca Blood's preface, which is fine but not startling. The editors are apparently so ashamed of this poor (and possibly successful; I paid up) attempt to make money on the popularity of blogging that they haven't even put their names to the book."
3,Excellent Condition,Book was in perfect condition and was delivered within the timeline the seller gave me. Wonderful seller. Definitely use them again!
2,You get what you pay for sometimes. I paid a buck!,Anyone want a broken knife? The handle broke off of one of the steak knives. They are flimsy. But I bought my set at wallmart for $1. That makess it worth it.
4,"Sturdy, ho hum looking.","Pretty good quality the metal was sturdy feeling. The only thing I didn't like was that the handles looked dull and unappealing. I got them for about $2 at walmart, there was a ton of them. Seems like no one wanted them, I guess because they were ugly or the boxes they came in where. Anyways I recommend these if you are on a really tight budget."
3,Inexpensive basic textbook,"The textbook covers all the main topics, but it doesn't follow good formula practice of defining all terms whenever a new formula is listed, and I spent a lot of time going back to previous material to see if terms were defined elsewhere."
4,The class sucked...,"...but it wasn't the book's fault. Personally, this course was the most difficult undergraduate course I took to get my Civil Engineering degree. I don't know if that was due to the professor, myself, the material, or a combination of all three. However, the book provides plenty of real world examples. I have not used it yet in the 'real world' to test its validity but that is because I work on the construction end rather than the design end.If this is required for your course, get it.If you need it to practice for the EIT or PE exams, I would recommend it.If you want this for a reference book, I think it would be a good addition.If you do not have any interest in designing reinforced concrete structures, don't get it.If you are an architect without an engineering background, this is not a good place to start. Here is the order I would recommend.Structural AnalysisGeotech + FoundationsConcrete + Steel"
3,Decent Book,"I was able get hold of older versions of this particular book. And, the info in this book is not changed much except for references to new code.Buy it if you must."
5,A poorly promoted artist with great potential,"I came across this single at Target, on clearance no less. And that orange sticker is like a magnet for me. Despite never hearing of the song, I bought it and figured there are hundreds of worse ways to spend my money. At first listen I was less than impressed, from the subdued first chords to the whispered chorus. After my initial listen, I set it aside and didn't think much of it. A week or two passed and I decided to pop the CD in my 3-CD player, to fill a space. I was overcome after two or three listens. Not unlike a song you hear on the radio and might change because you don't know it but will turn the volume up after a few listens, So Into You grew on me, and is still growing. A listen is required for any day to begin. So Into You has become my anthem, one of my favorite songs, and now I will follow up with a purchase of Tamia's entire CD. So Into You: A"
4,A great song taking us back to the 80's,"I think with this new albulm, Tamia can make a bigger splash than all her other albulms. It takes smooth and rich backround melodies similiar to Madonna, Janet Jackson and Whitney Houston from the 1980's. However, it also adds an extra '90s overtone which together flow heavenly with Tamia's sweet voice and gentle looks. A hit, NICK ""YOSHI"" SKY recomends it to any CD collection."
2,"""New"" edition: Same Old, Same Old - Big Disappointment","First, I want to point out that except for one other of the 7 reviews before mine, all were written previous to 2008--the copyright date of this book. So those reviews DO NOT pertain to this edition; they pertain to earlier editions. I have been using the previous (2002) edition of this book, so I was delighted when I discovered that a 2008 edition was coming out. It has a nice, new updated cover--very appealing. But it looks like that's about all that's changed. From what I can tell, the inside of the book is exactly the same--same pictured items, with no changes that I can see. I assume the prices are updated, although I can't really tell because I can't compare them with the old edition (which was from the library). Even though I got the book on sale, it was a big disappointment and not worth my money--I can go back to the library and get the same old thing!"
2,Disappointed PYREX Dealer Passes on 4th Edition,"I utilize glassware references often and already own PYREX: The Unauthorized Collector's Guide, 3rd edition. I purchasd the new 4th edition only to be disappointed. Page for page, the 4th edition presents the same information found in the 3rd edition, except for the addition of a few new photos. Author Barbara Mauzy missed the opportunity to create a 'must-have' supplemental with new information identifying unknown patterns, including dates of production for known patterns, and updating values, for example. Save yourself the expense, and buy a good-used 3rd edition."
3,wanted more,"There is some good info in this book, but there is so much more info that I constantly look up and can't find. I would say it would be a pretty good book for a beginning pyrex collecter."
3,Picture Book,This was a wonderful disappointment. While loaded with great high quality photos it lacked content for the serious collector. There was no guide to understand the makers marks. Nothing explaining the dates specific items were made only generalized groupings. How many were produced in which factory or other pertinent info. Though i can say it is loaded with good photos. It does not cover ever item Pyrex has made.
2,Price guise is a joke and lots of old information,Got to book for my birthday. Am very disappointed in the pictures and information. It seems thrown together and random. The unknown patterns in the back are not all unknown. It is a fun book to browse through even though the pictures are blah. But really could use an update on the information. The price guide seems way off.Lots of missing patterns too. More a book for the clear flame ware lovers than the retro colored stuff.Okay for a random coffee table book.
1,Big Disappointment,Big fat glossy softcovered waste of my money. Way too many pages on boring items like glass pie plates etc. Soooooo glad I didn't buy book on ebay though--that seller wanted 27 + shipping. The corning ware & vision cookware book is much better then this Pyrex book.
3,"Nice Pictures, Not Informative","This book is full of lovely color pictures of Pyrex ware. Sadly, it is not organized very well, and lacks solid information about things such as history, trademarks, years of production, glass composition, etc. The Rogove/Steinhauer book (1993) is a much better choice if you're looking for actual information and not just pretty pictures:Pyrex by Corning: A Collector's Guide"
1,Disappointment,The books title states 'collectors guide'. Yet there is nothing about how to date and read the stamps on the bottom. While it show the years a pattern was made it did not identify all the ways sets were sold. I also found errors in what sizes patterns were made. The value I did gain was seeing some patterns I did not know about. I do not see the value in the book for myself. I learned more on the Internet.
5,Pyrex,This was a gift and the recipient loved the book. It was very educational and well put together~pics were great!
3,Pyrex Collector's Guide,"A little disappointed. I was hoping it would cover a longer period than it did. I have some Pyrex bowls from the 80's and 90's I was interested in learning more about. What it did cover cover was very good, just not what I wanted. Maybe the auther would consider a Part II?"
2,description does not match the product,"This Nuby sippy cup is described as having both a single valve and the dual valve, these are two different Nuby products. The cup pictured actually has the single valve which is the silicone spout. This soft spout is great for the younger baby just leaning how to sip, but you'll need to move on to a hard spout.Why?It will leak. And your child will figure out how to make the liquid flow freely by turning it upside down and pressing on any flat surface."
2,30 70 toss up,"My son who is 16 mo. loves these Nuby ""No Leak"" cups....well they do leak when on thier side and the ""tear resistant"" nipples do tear. My son tore the plastic at the opening of the valve just from sucking on it. So not only did it spill everywhere but he also endned up getting to much fluid and either began to choke or wore what he was drinking. But they are great when you are switching over from a bottle and when they are teething."
4,Touching and sweet love story.,"A touching, uncomplicated love story where the couple are actually friends (and truly like each other!) before they become lovers. The conflict keeping the couple apart is a little on the weak side but the characters are so likable that it didn't bother me overmuch."
4,"All the suspense of ""The Bridges of Madison County.""","Sally Steward's characters come alive in her latest, greatest romance novel. Their home town becomes the reader's home town. Smell the lilacs, explore the cave, wonder to yourself -- will Kate marry her fiancé Edward, or will the other forces surrounding her change her destiny?Is her father going crazy like some people think? Who is he talking to? Who is he dancing with? Ghosts don't exist, do they?And what will happen to Luke? He's been in love with Kate since they were little kids. But she's engaged to Edward.If you liked ""The Bridges of Madison County"", this is a must read for you."
3,Depressing--a German book?!?,"This is a good read, although it is very bleak. Be prepared to have your dictionary in tow, as Schlink uses some esoteric words. I read the English translation and it is rather free. If you can, stick to the better: auf Deutsch."
3,PPD and survivor's guilt,"A story of post partum depression with a horrific outcome. The story is heart wrenching; however, I did not enjoy it. Was it simply the subject matter? Possibly. The story is told in flashbacks, by the lone survivor, and the writing is decent. Are the characters memorable? Unfortunately, I would have to say no. After some time, they have begun to fade from my mind.I recommend to those interested in the subjects of post partum depression and survivor's guilt."
1,Mentally Damaging,This was a book assigned for Summer Reading at my school and I had to put the book down for 2 weeks at a time. It's very very very disturbing and graphic and I wouldn't recommend reading it before you go to bed. It's a book with a frustrating storyline and characters whose motivations are incomprehensible. Two Thumbs WAY down.
4,Almost impossible to put down,"As many of the previous reviewers have stated, this is a gripping, disturbing and extremely well written novel. The subject matter is certainly topical and unnerving, and even though you know early on in the novel that something horrible is forthcoming, the author's weaving of the tale is brilliant. This could have been a melodramatic soap opera of a story, instead you begin to realise how the totally bizarre and horrific behavior of the mother is tolerated. This is truly a fine piece of writing, and if you are in a book club this would be an excellent choice."
4,Dutch psychological thriller,"A heart of stoneDutch psychological thrillerHard to say much about this book without giving too much away, but suffice to say that a previously 'perfect' family inexorably begins to fall apart with the birth of Ida, the fifth child, who suffers from strange and recurrent injuries. Is Mom, who seems to be slowly going mad, causing the troubles?The story is told partly in retrospect when Ella, the third child, returns to her childhood home, turns the pages of a family album, and begins to remember?Helluva good tale."
4,Beautiful but be warned,"This book is wonderfully written. It's been a long time since I've read something so beautifully crafted. However, read with caution, this book is an emotionally difficult read. The images this book leaves you with will haunt you forever."
1,Less than one star...,"This is a disturbing book. As I read it, I waited for it to be suspenseful as other reviewers described it. It was jumbled and dark. Don't bother reading it, especially in December!"
4,Glory Hole,"West of the Law was also published as ""Glory Hole"", anything to sell a book I suppose is okay, the Six Gun Kid and Jingling Spurs are also the same book, West of the Law takes place in and around Leadville, Colorado, not a bad story, good guys, bad guys and the usual romance."
5,I got a book without a cassette,You can get the cassette separately at Routlege. Here is the ISBN: 978-0-415-16378-1
2,not for audio- or video-philes,"I am not a hard-core audio- or video-phile, in the sense I am quite tolerant to bad quality recordings whenever the artistic outcome deserve the sacrifice. Still I find very hard to afford this title. Especially the audio track is tremendously bad. I wonder how much Kultur is responsible for this: are there any other editions of this program around?I would give one star : the second star is really for the outstanding singers performance"
2,A disappointment,"The great performances of these wonderful singers are NOT capture on this DVD. The sound quality if extremely poor, even by 1973 standards. The camera work is dreadful. It's actually painful to watch and listen to this DVD because you can't help imagining what was lost by the terrible production. Don't waste your money on this, or if you must have it, do as one reviewer advised and get the cheap Brazilian version on ebay."
1,Dreadful Production,"If you're a collector, it's worth the price for the history. But the other reviewers are right. The sound stinks, thevideo stinks, and if that weren't bad enough, this is one of those Wieland Wagner-ish production in which the sets don't have the slightest relation to the stage directions. A real stinkeroo in every respect. But it does document Nilson and Vickers."
2,"Great performances, terrible sound and camerawork","I am glad I have this to remind me of just how good Birgit and Jon Vickers were in this work. I never saw them perform this together, only individually.Having said that, the sound is so bad that I will probably continue to listen to Birgit/Bohm for Isolde and Vickers/Karajan for Tristan. How sad that they never recorded this together in the studio.The performances are great including the acting. Jon Vickers was one of the few people who could share a stage with Maria Callas and not get overshadowed. The Act III mad scene doesn't get any more intese than this.Buy this, and then get a second one in the future with better sound and filming."
1,No recommanding!,"I don't understand why the Rodolphe-CD-Version AND also the VHS-Version I know has a MUCH better HiFi-Stereo-sound-quality (this has just a very poor Mono-Sound) and the DVD has not. If you really wants to have the DVD of this buy the cheap brasilian-version you sometimes get at ebay below 10 $. Even that ist to much money for that. I tried to listen to the CD while watching the DVD, but there iss no syncronity. It was a very big mistake to buy this, especially because of the high shipping and additional tax."
3,"Yes, but....","Truth-in-advertising time: The sound is poor (which is surprising, since a CD recording of this performance in clear, vivid sound has long been available on a French import label), and the camera work is unsteady and amateurish, with washed-out colors. Still, this is the only known video of Nilsson and Vickers together in this opera, which they performed as a team only a handful of times (though there's a bootleg black-and-white videocassette of Nilsson in ""Tristan"" with Wolfgang Windgassen under Pierre Boulez). Vickers does ""Tristan"" excerpts in a Canadian videocassette, but with nothing like the intensity we see in this French show. Together, Vickers and Nilsson are the Tristan and Isolde of one's dreams, and even in this subpar DVD set their brilliance leaps out at you. The love duet and Tristan's third-act delirium are all you could ask for vocally. Until the Met releases its Eaglen/Heppner ""Tristan"" on DVD, this is the one to get, for all its flaws."
1,Achtung! lousy sound ahead,"Considering that this perfomance is from 1973, the sound is awful, being on a par with a poor AM radio, and with numerous dropouts. What is your excuse, Kultur, for issuing this release in the first place, much less without any words of warning as to the inferiority of the sound. I would imagine that with Nilsson, Vickers and Bohm, the musical values would be considerable, but to what extent are you going to be able to hear them? Shame on you, Kultur!"
1,The absolute worst sound,I thought I was listening to something recorded in 1912. The picture quality was not much better. Simply awful.
2,Tristan and Isolde - Gran Teatre di Liceu,"I was very dissapointed in the modernistic style of this production, strange sets and costumes that had no conection to the opera.Wagner - Tristan und Isolde / Opus Arte, Deborah Polaski, John Treleaven, Bertrand de Billy, Gran Teatre de LiceuI am looking for another production performed as it was intended by Wagner."
5,Perfect for One or Two Family Homes.,"I love these litlle pans. Great for two biscuits, one chicken breast, Twice baked potatoes..you name it. Amazon has a great deal on them and you cannot beat the quality I use them all the time."
2,Appeared Smaller Size Than Picture On Amazon Site,I was surprised at the size of these oval gratins they are good for someone who lives alone; single person. I feel they could have made them deeper and a little wider in size and shape.
3,"Very small, cannot be used on stove top","Its a very small piece, and I was not expecting some one like this when I ordered. Also, it is specified as not to be used on stove top. It is meant for decoration only, and not meant for cooking."
5,Mini bakers,I love these mini bakers. They are good for many items and can go into the oven up to 500 degrees.
3,very handy to get the syntax,Useful to get the syntax in emergency. But not to get good knowledge on the subject. It is better to refer the technet documentation.
4,Good activity,Bought for 3 year-old grandkids. They enjoy the bright shapes and can do some of the stitching. I imagine very soon they will be able to do a complete shape. The shapes seem pretty sturdy and I've knotted one end of each lace to cut down on frustration.
3,A Good Live Album From Phish,"Many of the songs are excellent. There are great versions of ""Scent of a Mule"" and ""Suzy Greenberg."" The second disk has a great medly of cover songs that I really enjoy, with the exception of the ""Purple Rain"" cover, which has attrocious singing and some bizarre vocal noisemaking near the end. Still, the fact that they medley between so many songs and then come back to the original song they started the medley with is a very impressive musical accomplishment. Some of the extended jams they get into in this album devolve a little too much into noise. The third disk contains the best jams of any of the disks (they are much spacier), and it is probably my favorite of the three CDs on the album. All in all, this album is well worth a listen for those who enjoy Phish."
2,Only for the die hard phans,"I am new to Phish. I bought Live Phish Vol. 16 (10/31/98, Thomas & Mack Center, Las Vegas, Nevada) and fell in love with it - it is now one of my favorite albums. Since I liked 16 so much, I decided to buy another Live Phish and just randomly picked 18. It is no where near as enjoyable as 16. The music is rather ordinary and does not show off the depth of talent that these musicians have as well as 16 does. My advice if you are relatively new to Phish is go for Vol 16."
4,"Not bad, but doesn't match the hype","I have been a Phish head for 4+ years and I listen to them off the wall. I heard that this show in particular was the legendary Tweezer fest and just suppost to be amazing. I picked it up, and it is a good, solid show. The set list is great, everything is played well, but it didn't absolutly blow me away like some of their other live stuff. I'm not sure exactly why, but Im not sure it lives up to it's reputation of being a legendary show. Anyway, everyone else loves it, and it's worth checking out deffinatly."
3,Pros and cons,"I purchased this because I was hoping the even distribution of baby's weight would prevent my back from aching, since the Ultimate Baby Wrap is supposed to go over both shoulders, across the stomach and around the lower back. I've tried a Maya wrap and it made my back hurt. However, the Ultimate Wrap hurts my back, too, so oh well - that's what I get for having a bad back, I guess. This wrap is a pain to get it on, and the fabric stretches so much, I don't feel like baby is being held securely. Also, if you are a large person (like me - size 18/20) there isn't really enough fabric for it to wrap around the lower back like it's supposed to, which could be why my back hurts with this one, too. On the positive side, it's much more comfortable to wear in the summer (unlike other slings) because the fabric is lighter and breathes. The fabric seems much more comfortable to the baby than a Snugli carrier (which I've also used). Maybe I'm just not using this wrap correctly, but I give up."
3,This wrap doesn't fly well!,"Very comfortable once you get it adjusted to you and your baby's size (took a couple times). BUT...I made the mistake of putting it on before we left for the airport, thinking I would be wearing it until we stepped off the plane. WRONG!!! Security made me take it off, and since I was a new user, I didn't dare try to put it on there since it would be dragging on the filthy airport floor. Otherwise, with some practice, I think it is a great product."
5,I LOVE this carrier,"I am a 1st time mom and have been looking for a good carrier for my son. My husband wanted to get a baby bjorn, but i just thought they were WAY too expensive. I searched and read all the reviews on the ultimate baby wrap so i bought it. ITS ALL TRUE!!! well, the good stuff anyways. I LOVE THIS CARRIER and so does my son! It is comfortable and feels very secure! I can actually have him in it and have both hands full without feeling like he will fall.whenever he is fussy (for no identifiable reason), i just put on the wrap and put him in and he calms right down and usually falls asleep.It is a real lifesaver in the grocery store. he hates the car seat so i would not make it through grocery trips if i did not have the wrap. i just put it on before i leave home.one thing i have noticed is i have to be careful what he is wearing when he is in it. Isaiah is very warm natured and so i just be sure he is not dressed really heavy if it is warm where we are and all is fine."
4,"Great wrap, even though it's complicated","This is a great carrier, once you figure it out. My husband and I had to take a few minutes to get it down, but after the first two or three times using it I didn't have to use the directions anymore. For a newborn, it is awesome - other carriers can feel awkward, but this carrier adjusts to the size.The drawbacks - this is made of a t-shirt-like material, so as you wear it the material stretches and the baby tends to slide down. Also, it is sufficiently complicated that you can't put it on while you hold the baby. I found that life was made easier if I put it on before I left my house, and then when I got out of the car where I was going I could put the baby in. It is comfortable enough to wear without the baby in too, so you can put it on once for the day even if you put the baby in and out."
2,don't bother,"I used this sling with my third child. If you watch the little video they give you with the wrap, it's easy to figure out how to use it. The problem is, when you start to put it on, it's one LOOONG piece of material -- the ""tails"" drag on the ground until you get it wrapped around you. So I never bothered wearing it outside the house, because unless I planned to keep it on all day, I would have to deal with the wrap getting dirty when I went to put it on.I personally found this carrier to be more comfortable to wear than the BabyBjorn,which I used with my first two children. However, by the time my baby was 4 months old, the stretchy fabric couldn't support his weight well enough and he would constantly slump down and I'd have to hoist him up to readjust the wrap. I'd have to readjust it at least every 5 minutes. So I just put it away and never used it again after that point. So the sling does have some bonuses, but I don't think it's worth the money."
2,A different opinion,"I purchased this because it was so highly rated online, even though I was wary of this style carrier. After several attempts of use, neither I nor my 8 week old felt very secure with it. The concept made sense, and the material is nice, but I never felt comfortable with her in it,and neither did she."
5,BEST MONEY SPENT,"This is the best money I have ever spent! I have a very high-maintenance baby who likes to be held, a LOT. I have spent lots of money trying different things and I am THRILLED with this wrap. It took a few tries to get it feeling secure and tight, but after three or four tries, this one is my FAVORITE. It beats out the more expensive carriers by FAR! It is the most comfortable for my back (my baby is about 20 pounds now) and does not pull at my neck muscles like the brand name carriers. I did watch the included video to really get the right way to put it on, i found the tighter I wrap it around me, the more snug the baby is and that feels good. I would highly recommend this to anyone! I have never taken the time to write a review before, but having searched and searched for six months for a comfortable carrier, this was worth reviewing! I could go on and on about this carrier!!!"
4,Comfy & secure - but it gets filthy,"At first, I loved this carrier. It feels very secure & comfortable for the baby & you. I had struggled with back pain using the Bjorn & my baby just kept getting heavier. (She's now 19 lbs at 5 1/2 months.) Since this distributes the weight over my hips and back, it's much more comfortable. It's very versatile, too - also unlike the Bjorn. I like being able to carry her on my hip. The only thing is that it is basically just an extremely long scarf of t-shirt fabric. While it's easy to put on at home, it's not something you want to try to mess with in a parking lot because there is just no way it's not going to drag on the ground while you get into it. (Especially if you're 5'1"", like me!) Plus, the fabric attracts particles, so watch out for pet hair! I actually got mine in black from another web site, but I'd recommend the heather gray, instead of either the navy or black. The pet hair & fine debris just shows too much!"
2,Not that impressed....,I bought this wrap based on the praise it received. But I think it is way too expensive for what it is. It is also time consuming and cumbersome to put on. You do get the hang of it but it still takes time to get it just right and drags the floor in the process. Also my 18 month old didn't seem that safe in it. I felt like he was about to fall out all the time. And I wondered if the bunched material under his butt and back hurt him. It pulls up on your shirt so make sure you wear a long one! And it left black looking fuzz all over my hands and clothes every time I touched it. I washed it several times and even lint rolled it and it still didn't help. It's also made of a thick t-shirt like material and made me and my son hot. The only thing about it I liked was that it didn't hurt my back or neck like other baby carriers.I am still on the search for the perfect baby carrier...
2,Disappointed,"I purchased the Ultimate Baby Wrap because of the glowing reviews I saw here, and after trying it a few times, I am a little disappointed.1. It is not easy to get on - lots of crossing fabric behind you, in front of you, etc.2. It is hard to get it tight enough to securely hold the baby.3. It is hot.The video was good - very nice to see how to use the product."
2,not as great as it looks,"I bought this product when my daughter was about one month old because she was too small for the tradtional carriers. It looked really great in the pictures, but when you put it on it just squeezes you in all the wrong places. My main complaint though was that my baby didn't take to it as much as I would have hoped and I might have tried harder to get her used to it, but the darn thing was so time consuming and complicated to put on that it just didn't seem worth it. My advice to parents looking for a great baby carrier is to get a tradtional cloth sling. I found mine online for less money, it's easy to use, just as versatile as this product and my daughter loves it. I carry her in it everywhere I go."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing- not worth $40. Didn't realize it's just a long cloth you wrap around and around your torso that takes a long time to put on, esp while the baby is crying. I find I still need to use one hand to support my newborn's head, so it's not that helpful. However, it does do a good job of distributing baby's weight and minimizing backaches. I just got a baby sling (posh papoose) that's much more convenient- arrived in the box assembled and ready to go. Sorry to be critical but don't feel this product is worth your money- better spent with a Snugli or a sling."
5,Excellent baby carrier,I just received this wrap and I love it. It was not hard to put on at all. You just have to read the directions. I did it all by myself with no problems the first time and I've never worn any kind of baby carrier before. It's so comfortable too! I'd recommend it to anyone.
2,Not secure enough & too bouncy,"This wrap is easy to use & fairly comfortable, except that you are constantly having to adjust it tighter. The pocket in the front seems great at first, but then starts creating little holes in the wrap at the pockets corners. My 10 pound baby bounced more than could be safe, & gradually sagged lower and lower, requiring constant tightening.I returned it & ordered an Ellaroo from Peppermint.com -- it is so much more comfortable & more secure, the baby doesn't bounce or sag, and it's beautiful."
3,Didn't live up to hype,"I purchased this wrap after reading several positive reviews, but I was not able to use it for more than 15 minutes at a time. It just didn't stay up. I got it when my little one was 2 mos old - at 11 lbs, she (and the wrap) would slowly inch downwards. I would find myself unconsciously sticking out my belly (like I need to do THAT) to try to keep her from ending up around my hips. I just bought a Baby Bjorn (on Ebay), I like it MUCH BETTER!"
2,not for newborn,I bought this wrap when my daughter was 5 weeks old and it does not have the head support that a young infant needs. It wasn't as hard to put on as I thought from the other reviews. I will try it again in a few months.
3,its not that great.,this carrier is not so great. I bought it for the versatile carrying positon but is stuck in the front carrier position only. The wrap is way to long when you take it off so i cut a few inches off mine. I can never do the back carrying postion I want to do because my husband don't know how to put the baby on. When wearing it even in the winter I was very hot. Then my 10 month old was as well. its okay i would rather have something else.
1,misleading,The picture does not show the true nature of this item. It is a body wrap difficult to put on
2,Time consuming,"This product looks cool and the fabric is comfortable. However, I don't have the patience to wear this. It took so long before I got my baby in it."
2,Worst baby item I have bought yet...,This baby wrap is so complicated! I have had it for three weeks and still don't know how to use it. The instructional video is no help either! Don't waste your money!
1,Disappointed,I had lower back surgery and thought this product would be the greatest. It fits comfortably when you eventually get it on but I found because of the Jersey material it starts to droop lower and lower regardless of how tight you have it. After 30 minutes of walking around my house my baby (15 pounds) was around my navel and crying.
2,"Worked okay, but had a bad experience","I bought this while pregnant with my third child. I wore my second child in it even while pregnant and it worked okay. Just for fun I even wore my oldest child in it to see how it felt since she was four at the time.When my baby was born, I tried wearing him and while it was great for breastfeeding, unfortunately the material would stretch and my baby would sink lower and lower until he was in a ball at my pelvis.THEN one day I put it on to wear it on a walking trip and MY INFANT FELL OUT of the Ultimate Baby Wrap. I knew how to put the thing on. I'd been doing it for 6 months by this time. That was not the problem. Thankfully, my hands were up by him and my friend was standing next to me and we caught him. I took the wrap off immediately and got rid of it.I love to wear my babies and still wear the younger two, but I will NOT do it in an Ultimate Baby Wrap."
3,Tedious wrapping,"It holds the baby nicely but wrapping it around the baby is a two person job. If you got the time and help, this might be for you but, if you are like any other parents in the world, get something easier to use."
2,"Too Long, too complicated, too much","To be fair we didn't have this for long. We tried the carrier on 16 month old (at that time) and it took to look to put on and immediately began to sag. I wanted mainly for a sling, so that in public I could nurse without attracting to much attention, but it was too long and too much of a hassle to put it on so we returned it. I have yet to fine one that will fit and still be a reasonable price."
2,A Little Dangerous,"I bought this because of all of the great reviews, the price,and because it looked comfortable and stylish. I watched the video and did not have any problems putting the wrap on in less than a minute. I did however have problems with two out of five positions that it advertises. When I put my baby in it facing out, his circulation in his legs always gets cut off. If I loosen the straps, I feel like he's going to fall out. I was terrified when my husband noticed that his legs were turning blue! I also hate the sling position. You are supposed to be able to nurse in the sling, but it is impossible! Same problem, it's always too tight and he's suffocated or too loose and you have to hold his head the whole time. I do like the wrap for the facing in position, but that's it for now. I will be buying another carrier."
4,My baby loves it!,"When I first put it on I thought ""what have I gotten myself into?"" Then I watched the 5 minute video that came with it and ""AWESOME ... this is so easy"" Now I can put this thing on in a bout 30 seconds. In other words if all else fails ... watch the directions ;o)The only thing about it that I don't like is that I live in North Florida so it can be very hot to say the least. I have to wear a tank under it. I think once it starts to cool down a bit in the fall that I will absolutely love it in a 5 star kind of way."
5,Don't be caught without it,"I first was very discouraged in taking it out of the box. I almost just sent it back. I thought it was crazy to need a video to use it. I took 5 minutes watched the video and it totally makes sense now. It will take several minutes longer to put it on, but I have 2 small children so either one can ride in depending on who needs it more. If my 2 month old is sleeping I can leave her in her carseat and hook her to the single stroller and strap my 2 year old (she's only 22lbs) to my hip. I'm very excited and can't wait for our next outing. It's much less bulky than the Snugli soft carrier and way more versatile. I highly recommend it for someone with a colicky baby and someone that has another small child."
5,Simply Awesome!,"I've never written a review before, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity this time. I received my Ultimate Baby Wrap today...I love it and my 9 week old son loves it already! The instructions were a snap and I had the wrap on and my son in it within seconds! He fell asleep after 5 minutes and stayed that way for an hour while I was able to get some long overdue laundry folding done. I love that this will accommodate him when he gets bigger. One of the key features I am looking forward to is the hip carry. This will also come in handy when we go on long day trips with my 3 year old. I have a Sit n Stand Stroller and sometimes my 3 year old wants to nap...there is no place for her to do so if my infant is occupying the front seat. Because the Ultimate Baby Wrap fits nicely in my diaper bag, I can carry my son and let my daughter nap.Great product...highly recommended!"
2,"Nice idea, but...","Despite that fact that two friends returned the Ultimate Baby Wrap, we thought we'd give it a try. The video was interesting, but difficult to emulate. The wrap never quite looked like the pictures. Our baby was not adequately supported either. The wrap just squished him up. The wrap went back to the store."
1,Toxic material and terrible design!,"I read a lot of reviews for a baby sling and thought that this one was given the best review, so I bought it. I got it and when I opened it was assaulted by the toxic-smelling cloth. I tried to keep an open mind, and then tried to put the thing on. The other reviewers are right--you need to be a Houdini to put this thing on properly. I finally got the thing on me, and by this time was sweating up a storm (I live in Colorado and in January it's very cold here - I cannot imagine trying to put this thing on or wear it if you live in a warmer climate). I managed to get my 3 week old baby into the thing but he was almost suffocated by the excessive cloth, and most of all, was being poisoned by the toxic-smelling fabric that the thing was made of. I returned it after trying it again and not being able to take the smell, as well as getting frustrated again by the design. I'm going to try the babysling that comes in organic cotton (www.babysling.com)."
2,Not as good as expected!,"This wasn't as good as I had expected. It's difficult to wrap around your body and make it fit comfortably, and then trying to place a wiggling child in it was even worse! I'm looking into purchasing something easier to use, like a Baby Bjorn. It would be worth paying a little more. You get what you pay for..."
1,This Product is Useless!!!!,We bought this carrier after a few recommendations from friends that have used this item. I was also attracted to the many different positions for carrying the baby. After taking it home and trying this baby wrap we were quite disappointed. The material is so long that it has to drag on the floor in order to wrap it and of course it will get dirt on it from dragging on the floor which will be on the baby and yourself. Not to sterile. The carrier does not seem secure at all in any position. Not safe for the baby the product is to flimsy and can move and the baby can fall out. Get a regular carrier that works for you but make sure you try them on at the store to get a better idea of how it fits on your body and where babys head will end up being. Since a lot of the cariers do not accomodate shorter peolpe like myself of 5'3''.
2,I didn't realize what I was getting,"The wrap is what they say, soft and comfortable. The problem for me was as a Baby Bjorn user, I had the idea from the picture that it was a more fitted item. I didn't realize that I'd have to wrap about 7 feet of cloth around me in order to use it. This had my husband laughing when I explained I paid $40 for a long piece of cloth. To put it on, it means draping most of it on the ground while wrapping begins. Not something to do in a store, parking lot, or even on my kitchen floor. The upshot is that you can abosrb up all manner spills off the floor while putting your baby on. Fabulous!"
1,"Dont waste time, money","Recieved this as a gift, yesterday, will be returning it today. Comes with a video, because to actually USE it is so convoluted, not to mention, time-consuming. If you have a crying baby, spending 10 minutes trying to wrap this GIGANTIC piece of heavy cloth around yourself isn't going to work.Not to mention, I used the directions twice to wrap the thing, and both times, the stuffed animal I placed in it FELL OUT. It is also VERY thick cloth and is extrememly hot.SO, if you are in a hurry and make a small miscalulation with the tension of the wrap, you will eather drop the child out of the bottom, OR smother the baby. NO THANKS, Ill go for a Baby Bjorn."
3,gets too twisted,"It is comfortable and once you get used to putting it on it is easy. With one kid it's ok, but with 2 it takes too long to get on and it gets twisted when you take baby out and then to put baby back in you have to straighten out the sling it gets bunched up. The cotton material stretches out so i have to redo it a couple of times a day and that is a pain. I got another carrier at Kangarookorner.com The adjustable fleece pouch is the best. It takes all of five seconds to put on and put baby in. Totally worth the money. Kangaroo Korner has the only pouch/sling I will ever buy again and I have tried all of them."
1,Too complicated,"My husband and I are smart people, but even after reading the instructions and following them closely, I don't think we ever got this to work correctly. We tried it when our daughter was 1-2 months old and no matter which way we had her in the carrier, she hated it. We never tried another carrier, so I don't have a point of comparison, but we hated this one so much, that we brought it back to the store."
5,Finally! Comfort and practical,"I don't ever write reviews, I just read them. However my baby and I enjoy this product so much that I felt the need to share.It is not difficult to use. If you can't understand the simple directions on the side of the box they have also included a DVD for those who need to see it in action.It is comfortable and I can wear it for hours carrying my baby around doing everything from housework to playing the organ! (Yes, organ! and she is so comfortable she sleeps right through it.)I like that it feels like I am as close to my baby as when we're snuggling at feeding time.It doesn't have lots of pockets, straps, head rests or other things that make infant carriers bulky. It has one large pocket that I use for a burp rag and pacifier. That's all I need."
2,Not great once baby is 15 lbs. +,"I purchased this carrier and loved it when my daughter was under 15 lbs. However, as she grew the wrap didn't support her weight as it claimed. Supposedly it is good from birth to 3 years or 5 lbs. to 35 lbs. I found this absolutely false. Everytime I would put my 17 lb. baby in the carrier after about 20 minutes of toting her around she would be down to my knees. I tried everything from making it tighter (which wasn't great for me) to taking it off and putting it back on everytime this occured which was cumbersome. I think there are better carriers for babies as they grow and hope you do your homework before purchasing."
2,My Comments,"For those of you who know me (And you do Syrinx ;) you all know how stubborn I can be when it comes to reality in this book. And frankly, there's none. Bently really scrwwed up in writing (but then, big surprise) I like realism when I'm reading about real life -- or something that could be considered real life. If I wanted to read fantasy about horse-like critters, I'd read something like Mary H. Herbet's Dark Horse series. But if I'm reading about something that's close to reality -- with real places, real creatures, well gosh darn it, but I'd want things to be realistic. And fifteen-year-old Cindy winning a Grade I Stakes race like the Dubai World Cup when she'd only ridden in two previous races was just so -- blegh. Nevermind that I have issues with Champion, but I never did like Cindy either. I very much preferred the books that Joanna Campebell wrote -- they were realistic in many ways."
3,This book was kinda wierd.,"I usually like all the Thoroughbred books, but they are getting too unrealisitic. This is fiction, but this book is too far fetched. First of all, what happened to the Townsends? They have just disapeared. They always put some spark into the series. They made the books more interesting. Then what happened with Limtless Time? How did he make it? I mean he never was even talked about in the other books, and now suddenly he is running the one of the most important races in horse racing. Also, why did the author make Ashleigh mean. She is, in my opinion the best Characters in the whole series. She would never be mean! Karen Bently needs to start changing her books!"
2,I liked Joanna Campbell's stories much better.......,"I didn't really like this book because practically 12 books were all on Cindy, Cindy, Cindy. She acted like a brat at the track in Arabia, saying Champion was ""her horse."" why did Ashleigh ever let her ride Champion anyway? It was obvious Champion was going to win, and this book is all about dating this ugly guy named Max."
1,THIS IS NOT THOROUGHBRED!!!!!,"What is happening? I HATE the new authors. They have sucked the life out of the TB series! What happend to the littel orphan girl who was afarid to talk to eneyone?? Cindys so good she can tell wats wrong with a horse when Ashley can't!! Ashley is my fav. character. Later in the series Ashley is a hard, uncareing,workacholic person! That is NOT the Ashley I used to read about. How can the do that to her? It's like putting someome else in Ashley's body. She wouldn't yell at eneyone(except Caroline).All the old characters have vanished or totally changed. None of that can be changed now! I'm vvvveeerrryyy happy Jonna is back. The series has to turn around now, it can't get eney worse it's not possiable.:("
2,What Went Wrong?,"I am very angry with the way the Thoroughbred books are changing. Joanna Campbell did a far better job writing them, and I think the new author needs to take a hike. Ashleigh and Samantha have always been my favorite charcters, and now they are totally kicked out of the picture. Especially Sammy in the later books. And what of the other characters, like Mandy and Jilly? They played such large parts in previous books, so where are they now? I especially dislike Cindy. She was tolerable at first, when she had just one special horse...Glory. Now though, she has had numerous 'Wonder Horses' and as soon as a new book comes out, she drops them. I say kill Cindy off, and bring back Sammy and Ash. And stop creating all these stupid new characters!"
3,Save the Thorughbred Series!,"The Cindy and second generation eventing portions of the series were dark days for Thoroughbred. The plots have since switched back to racing and the newest few books have been exceptional. Just as we thought there was hope for the Thoroughbred series to be restored to its former glory Harper Collins has decided to end the series abruptly after #72. With such a dedicated following and online fan base with members from all over the world, this is a classic and beloved series that has inspired many people and provided horse fans with vicarious thrills and adventure. Ashleigh saved Wonder, now it's up to you to help save Thoroughbred. [...]"
2,Get Real!!,Cindy is acting so stuck-up just because she is a jocky. I also thing this because this is her 3 race and she is in the Dubi world cup plu-leeez
3,"I haven't even read it, but...","I haven't read any Cindy books, but it seems like she has too many ""special"" horses. I mean, she has Glory, Storm, and Champion, forgetting about them each in turn, picking up a new ""better"" one, training it into a Triple Crown winner, then moving on. Finally she forgets all of them, goes to Belmont, hurts her shoulder, and finally remembers Champion. I havn't read any books yet, so I might be wrong, but this is my impression."
1,My review is about how bad this book is!,"I don't know a lot about horses but I can tell when I am reading about a snob!! I mean Cindy gets whatever she wants whenever she wants! Hello? In the real world you don't get whatever you want! Kids shouldn't read this stuff because they will start to think they can get whatever they want, and they can't!!!!!!!"
1,Discusting,"Cindy makes me nauseous. The spoiled, self centered, and other words that I don't deem appropriate to be writen about of a book of this calibur, is, in a sense, discusting. I would not recommend a book like this to anyone. Child's book or not. Children shouldn't read about people like Cindy because we would get just that. Cindy. Cindy wants this, Cindy NEEDS that. I don't want to read crap like this. It's a book about what Cindy wants, not about the horse, or the setbacks, which are non existent. Some people may like unrealistic blabber, not I. I stopped this series way before it got out of hand (I believe that was the book about Glory's first record setting race). And I've stayed the heck away from them since. Those that keep complaining that the books are crap, well, they probably won't get any better. If you want a good racing series then why not amuse yourself and write your own."
2,Big surprise,"Hey, guess what? The beauitful, wonderful, and otherwise PERFECT Cindy McLean has done it again! She suddenly turned into the best jockey in the world, riding the best horse in the world (consequently Wonder's Champion) to victory in the most prestigious race in the world! What is with this? Do these people have no bad luck? Every time she wants something, she gets it! Give me a break! How often is an aprrentice who lost their first race allowed to ride a Triple Crown winner? Boy, I wish I were her! My life would be perfect! Past number twenty-four, I haven't read a single book, and I'm awaiting Joanna's Campbell's new series eagerly."
1,I HAVE QUESTIONS,"Now, in the last book Wonder's Champion (and I really don't like that name, very uncreative) was winning the Triple Crown. Amazing feat, yadda, yadda . . . and suddenly he's in the Dubai World Cup. Now, most of us horse racing fans will realize that the Dubai World Cup is in March. The Triple Crown is in May and June (Kentucky derby: May 2, Preakness: May 16, Belmont: June 6). So, you are practically missing about a year between these races. Why not send him to the Breeder's Cup, there's another book( where I predict he would have won effortlessly). What's up with that? I guess it really doesn't matter because after this book Wonder's Champion disappears anyway. But I guess the writer really wanted Cindy to turn 16 and couldn't wait any longer. And it isn't realistic that Cindy comes along and, after 3 races, wins the Dubai. It doesn't work that way. So I guess Wonder's Champion was to good for the Breeder's Cup."
4,I liked the book pretty darn well,"I liked the book a lot. But it was not my favorite. I think it was very interesting when Cindy kept worrying about the race. My favorite was the suspense about whether or not Champion would win or not! I liked this book because it had a lot of suspense in it, and i like that!! This is my first reveiw, and I am just getting used to doing this. Great to read others opinions about the series. I have been hooked on them for 2 years, and look forward to even MORE and BETTER ones...KEEP WRITING!! Laura Nelson, age 11"
1,This book sucks!,I love The TB series but I hate Karen Bently! She has toally ruined the series! I have all books and I kepp readng the series just to find out what happens! i hate this book!
3,Not as good as I had hoped.,"To the reader of this text, I am sorry, but I did not like this book all that much. It became too much of a soap opera. This is Real Life. Cindy would know better then to take a valuable horse like Champion out and do something foolish. The situation between Cindy and Max is getting a little mushy. Overall, I was very disappointed with the book"
4,this was a good book.,"i have read all the Thoroughbred books published (1-59 + all special editions)and have loved them all. Aribian Challenge was one of my favorites. I really liked how it was written. i didnt use to like Cindy, but this book really opened her up to me. I was sad when they took her out of the series for a while, but i was over joyed when they brought her baq in around # 54. in the book cindy goes the though a hard time. Though she is exstatic about riding champion in the D. World Cup she is nervous about racing against ash. when cindy snuck out and rode champion at night and got caught i was on the edge of my seat. THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!"
1,Hardly Worth One Star (contains major spoilers),"I hate to say this about a TB book, but this not only ranks lowest in the TB series, it's probably the worst book I ever read. Cindy is a winning-obsessed whiny brat, Champion is suddenly a perfect mannered gentlman, and Ashleigh doesn't even act like the old Ash. Plus, I can't believe Cindy won the race! I agree w/ Ben's father in what he said in CDA about the Dubai World Cup. Champion won in spite of Cindy, not b/c of her. And since when is the track that hosts the Dubai World Cup (can't quiet remember the name) made of sand? It's supposed to be a lot like the Churchill Downs track, which Champion handled fine.If you must read this book, buy is used or better yet, get it out of the library."
2,Well....,"Okay, I can't say this is the best book. I mean, come on. Cindy beats Ashleigh in some really important race? And it's Cindy's second or third race! Cindy didn't deserve to win that race. No offense to Champion, he's great. But in her first race she's in tears because she lost! Sore loser. But like I said, Champion's great and I like reading about him. So if you like Champion, then you should read this book."
1,This book is too unrealistic,Cindy can't beat Ashleigh! Ashleigh is one of the best jockeys in the world! And how come they never fall off in a race? Ashleigh has fallen off twice so far in the series. Just yesterday a jockey came off during a race and died! More of the other jockeys fall off and Ashleigh OR Cindy can't be that perfect! And Champion is not Cindy's horse no matter what happens!
4,"It was good, but ......","Cindy is abit obsessed with winning. Max is really nice to her, and she didn't even appreciate it when she was worrying about winning, but I can't believe you think it! No, it wasn't the best, and yes, Cindy does think to much about winning, but she's not that bad. Plus, I think the book was good, learning abit about Arabia was fun! Umm .. What else is there .? Well, Cindy can be nice so I don't hate her. Overall, it was quite good."
1,"Okay Cindy Can We Say, SPOILED?","Cindy is such a brat. All she thinks about is winning. Umm can we say spoiled? What she needs to do is just shut up about Champion always winning. He is not even undefeated. What happened to the little orphan girl that never won anything in her life? How can Max even stand her? And then Cindy gets all upset becuse Ashleigh told her Champion wasn't Cindy's. She only told her the truth. Then she goes from champion racer to champion racer. What happened to Glory, Pride, Glory's Joy, etc.? Did they mysteriously dissappear? If you ask me Cindy is not a good sport. I mean think about when she lost her first race. When she spun on her heal and left as the winning jockey was about to give her a tip. Geeze!!! Yet a good plot and all. But it was too predictable."
3,Down The Drain,"What does Bentley have against describing things? I never once knew if it was night or day, hot or raining! And, why wasn't Cindy very happy after winning the Dubai? I was laughing when Ashleigh yelled at her after taking Champion out at night--Cindy's a brat! Who said Champion was her colt? And how come Bentley treats winning the Triple Crown like an everyday thing? But what I thought was the worst aspect of this book was that it skipped a year. Didn't he race during that time? What about the Breeders' Cup? Wouldn't he be in that? Not the way Bentley writes! But I hear there's a new author--and she's worse! Upset and confused--Equus."
2,"nice pictures, but incorrect info on quite a bit of the stuff.","This is a nice book for the pictures, but there is some unforgivable information in here that should have been better edited. First off, in the electric guitar section, the say that Fender had a famous Stratocruiser model. Of course, if you know anything about Fender, it is a StratoCASTER. Also, they say in the sitar section that The Beatles jammed in concert with Ravi Shankar. George Harrison did, but the Beatles did not. This book is worth nothing if it can't inform correctly... Overall disappointment, but at least the pictures matched the instrument description..."
3,expensive and not durable,"This overgrip is not a usual tacky design, it is like a filter paper to the touch. It is very absorbent and has a great grip. The only downside is that it is not durable. After 3-4 hours of play, it will start to shed and will become slippery. This overgrip is only capable of one match and not more, its price is a factor too."
4,works well,"I hooked the up to my old DVD player, but now I have a HD DVD player I use my HDMI connection. I ddn't have the time to hook up the monster cables to see the difference"
5,A classic wildlife book.,"Donald Culross Peattie was a great writer, and I have a number of his books, especially his books on American trees... and would like to some day have all of his books in my own personal library.This one is an old classic...everything about it is excellent. Would make a great gift for any kid who's interested in nature."
3,How to Heal from Psychic Attack the Problem Solvers Alphabet,"Ok, but not what I was expecting. If you are into this then you would like the book."
1,This toy is cute but useless,"My 6 month old got this for christmas. In the package it looked so cool but once the batteries were in it really faild to impress. The toy has only one funtion. You press the four cornres and the butterfly makes a noise and there is a barely noticable light on its cheeks. The toy got no responce from my baby. I took the batteries out already, no point in wasting them if the toy is no fun!!!!!"
4,Good TV for the money - but no built-in HDTV tuner,Good quality TV but Amazon shows the incorrect Technical Description (no built-in HDTV Tuner and not 1000:1 contrast ratio). Refer to Product Description at bottom of page for correct information.
4,Fun,I like this game alot but i only gave it 4 stars because it only has four save slots which is very annoying if you want to play every character and dont want to delete old characters.
3,Too Bad About This Game,"Okay I am a huge fan of the films and decided to check out the game LOTR-ROTK by EA Games, Seemed great, the price was great too!, Too bad it doesn't work, this game won't even run after being installed, I checked out some on-line support and although I have video/DX.9 installed this game still won't work. Too bad I am returning the game, so buyer beware make sure you really check out system requirements (that's still no guarantee) The only thing I've noticed is that similar writers have had this problem as well, Well here's a head's up to EA Games, take it easy on all the technical stuff guys, we just wanna play ok?"
4,MEDIOCRE,"I borowed this game from a friend, and its not quite as good as the 2 towers. You have less moves, and the two towers is easier to get used to. I like the fact that you can play as Gimli, but still, to do even an easy thing like heal you have to find a bunch of herbs and stuff. BBBBBOOOOOORRIINNNGGG!!!! I don't know how to say this but its not quite as fun as the Two Towers"
2,OK,"Well, this game is allright. It defiantly isn't as cool as Harry Potter or Nintendogs (Which I can't wait to get)or Mario but it is OK. But let me tell you one thing I LOVE THE LORD OF THE RINGS BOOKS AND THE MOVIES! This game just didn't do it for me. The graphics are pretty cool but... I get very frustrated after playing this for a while. One reason is there are little stones always in your way, and the simplest things such as walking onto a bridge are immpossible. Also, it seems very hard to beat a level. I play this game sometimes, but not that often, only when I am extremly bored. One cool thing about it though is that you can pick what character you want to be, Eowyn, Aragorn, Gandalf, Frodo, Legolas, Gimli etc. So out of a ten, this game gets a 4 or 5."
5,GREAT GAME,this is awsome but get strategies from game faqs.com hit you need level 20 to eat the game gimly is the best andlevel up indwarven halls with spiders.this game rocks
1,Despicable,"This game has the absolute worst gameplay ever, third person gameplay can rarely be amazing, and here it just plain stinks. I can't tell you how many times the camera has lost track of my player, the physics actually make the movie seem real, the character movement is so limited I feel like my hands are tied, the graphics are nice, which is a plus, but next to a whole stack of minuses. My suggestion, wait for the movie and play the card games."
3,Some good tips but mostly common sense,"When I bought this book, I expected a detailed summary of how to get into a field when you don't have all the typical experience required. Instead this is just another ""Improve your job hunting skills"" book. Its got a few good tips about writing your resume and cover letter, but not much else that hasn't been said before."
5,Great Concept,Got a couple of these little units paired with the Monster Revolution 200 Lighting Controller and absolutely love them. They can be essentially hidden because of they use radio frequency waves.
5,Works Great!,Our first night it drizzled and the seal kept the rain out. It dries clear. Didn't notice any problems with the sealant.
5,It's about time wheres the rest of the seasons???,"I was wondering how many more times I would have to watch the Season 1 dvd before they got the hint to release another season. This is my favorite TV show of all time and the only question I have is what about seasons 3,4, & 5 come on with them already?????"
1,A-Team Rocks! Universal Doesn't!,"This box set was a horrible rip-off. I love the show and this season has some great episodes, but I couldn't watch them all because the DVD keeps skipping and sometimes becomes just plain unreadable. I have a Playstation 2 which can read practically any type of digital disc known to man without problems, but it can't read this. It's not just one disc, either. All of the discs had problems. I believe that this is a result of the two-sided disc, because try as I might, I couldn't find a single scratch on any of the discs and after I cleaned them thoroughly, they continued to skip in the same exact places. I intend on writing Universal to try to get a replacement copy, but in the meantime, I am very disappointed with the quality of this box set."
2,I was disatisfied and disappointed with the items that i recieved from this person.,"I emjoyed watching this season of a team until i got to the last disc and it wouldn't play. it took me a long time to find out?that the disc was damged beyond repair, so i can't watch the entire last disc. I will not buy dvd's from this person again and i advise other people to avoid buying items from this person as well, unless they want scratched or broken items."
1,Boycott Universal TV to DVD Box Sets,"Ever notice, Universal TV to DVD box sets are the highest priced, and are the only ones, who replace the original music, they must be making a lot of money, if you boycott them, they will have no choice, but to kept the original music in, can't make money, if nobodys buying them, but that's not going to happen, considering they did it again for season 3, even after all the protest, hit them where it hurts, the wallet."
3,"Details, details",This was an excellent book in many ways. The reader comes away with an understanding of just how influential the Medici were. One also gets a good look at the Papacy and the political workings of the church. I found it readable up to a point but the enormous amount of detail on who was related to whom and who was murdering whom and why left me rather confused at times. If you are a history major focusing on Italy the details about the structure of the government will probably be interesting for you. I found it over burdened with a mountain of detail that detracted from the enjoyment of this book.
5,History comes alive,"Christopher Hibbert created a masterpiece with this work. It chronicles the fortunes of the Medici family from when its first leader, Cosimo comes to renown in Florence in 143 to when heirless Gian Gastone dies in 1737. The history is very interesting, it gives an insider's look into the complex world of Florence and Europe in the Renaissance. I learned many interesting things, particularly about the corruptrion in the Catholic Church at the time. My only qualm is that the author seems to lose interest with after Part 3 ends. The first 3 parts cover 100 years and last 260 pages and the last 140 years only take up 50 pages. Also of note are the notes that give information about notable villas and works of art that are mentioned. This would be extremely useful if one were to travel to Florence. Overall, an excellent read that will enrich your understanding of the Past."
3,"Long on Information, Short on Plot","Anyone who is interested in Florence or the Italian Renaissance would enjoy reading this book about the family that ruled Florence for so many centuries. From the famous artists they patronized (including Botticelli and Michelangelo) to the corrupt Popes they sent to Rome (Leo X and Clement VII) to their complicated relationships with foreign rulers (Henry VIII, Francis I, Charles V, etc.), this book covers all aspects of the Medici life in intricate detail.However, with the notable exception of the brutal Pazzi Conspiracy, the book is a bit dry and slow. As a historical account, it is very factual and unbiased, but it would have been more interesting to see the author take a stand and present his views on the family that are at times heroic (in the case of Lorenzo the Magnificent) and sometimes deplorable and inexcusable (most notably in the behavior of the two Popes themselves)."
2,Good intro to a very famous family,"Normally i dont buy books authored by Christopher Hibbert because i dont like his style.I think he's style is dry,stale and not at all enjoyable.But when i found this book in a book fair for just a dollar, i jumped at the chance.But the fact is that the book is a typical Hibbert book.Very dry and reads like a legal document of 5000 pages.But at least you get to find who the Medicis were and their contributions to Florence.The book gets more interesting in thre last 150 pages.I think its because the last Medicis were so bad and rotten that at least you get to enjoy their problems and how that lead to their fall.I think the book can also help you understand some of the sights, monuments and churches in Florence since they put so much money into them.But, again, Mr Hibbert does a lousy job with the story and i found myself reading faster so i would finish the book."
4,House of Medici,"Just finnished reading this book. I'd say it is unbias. It is jam packed with facts and Historical refs about The Medici family and their impact on the Italian Culture, Catholocism and European Politics. The book is a good historical overview, partly slow going but a valuable read for those wishing knowledge on the Italian Renaissance. I doubt that the Medici were as powerful during their respective times as the Rothschilds or the Rockefellers but the Medici was most deffinately the most powerful, or one of the most powerful families in Europe, if not the World with more direct influence over Culture, Politics and Religion. Very good book. Worth the read and a good addition to any library."
5,Very Readable,"After being to Florence, I've become very interested in its art and history. One day at the bookstore I decided to pick up a book on the Medici, who are an extremely important part of Florentine and also European history. I then purchased this book by Christopher Hibbert. From start to finish I was hooked. I would recommend this book especially to people, like myself, who are not at all familiar with Italian history. Its a great start for those who are interested in learning about the renaissance. I've already lent it to a few of my friends and they all loved it. I your looking to purchase a great read let this book be it. You wont regret it."
3,A Good Introduction,"I think that the book is an ideal launch pad for those who know little or nothing about the topic (such as myself).The book is very readable and the level of detail is sufficient for one to form a reasonably good knowledge base on the subject.Personally, was a little disappointed that book contained more detail about the Medici's contribution to the arts but very little on the actual business enterprise that allowed them to accumulate so much wealth."
4,High quality popular history,"This talented author of a long list of popular histories does an excellent job of telling the story of one of the most fascinating families in European history. Founded by the wiley oligarch Cosimo (called Pater Patriae), the enormously wealthy Medici became Grand Dukes of Tuscany and provided some of Europe's most colorful statesmen, popes, soldiers, scholars, and patrons of the arts. They were the embodiment of the Renaissance in Italy and they ruled Florence, frequently controlled the papacy, and influenced the policies of the entire Continent for 300 years. Princesses married them, kings borrowed money from them, other city states feared them, and Michelangelo and Botticelli worked for them. To understand the origins of both modern Europe and the self-made aristocrat, you must read about them."
3,Lacking of information,"After reading this book, I wanted to understand how it was the ""House of the Medici"" I understand it is an older book, but then after reading in other books about the Ottoman Empire that had more information about the Medici's, how is it that some of the Medici's dealings with the Sultans or even the rest of Europe were not more told. The Medici's arms spread over Europe in many ways. Many of their accounts of the Medici's, especially when they were exciled, was not in here, of which I found in other books of the same writing period. The Author had to have this available, but did not use it. The family is what is of concern with the finacial makings, and only divulges information on the most celebrated Medici's. The entire family was not given consideration. The author needed many other scholars to find this information, but was lacking in many of the families history. The House of the Medici's : ITs Rise and Fall??? This books falls short of historical information."
4,Time Traveler,This book is one of the good ones that can take us back in time to an era that we can only imagine. The different characters live again as you turn each page.
4,Relive the Renaissance,"After the PBS series ""The Medici"" (2003), I was after an informative book which was well-researched, yet not dusty and learned. So Hibbert's engaging, evocative style was most welcome. Hibbert fleshes out the vibrancy and brutality of life during the Renaissance with panache. If the description of the charges against Pope John, the former pirate, does not make you laugh, then this book is not for you. My only criticism is that much is made of the vivid colour of clothes and paintings of the time, yet all pictures in the book are black and white with some loss of clarity in reproduction."
3,"slow in parts, but covers a lot of ground","A wide ranging history of a very well-connected family. It touches on Michaelangelo, Leonardo Da Vinci, Boticelli, Machiavelli, Martin Luther, even Henry VIII's request for an annulment from Catherine of Aragon. All the Renaissance gossip made up for telling me more than I ever needed to know about Florentine politics."
1,Hard to Follow,"I was interested in this video because I once took a Tai Chi class in college and was interested in starting back.I found this video hard to follow. There are two styles used. In the first part, it is like a class. Scott talks to you directly and helps you through the moves. This was okay.In the second part, Scott is narrating while he does a workout. This is where the real problem is. He tells you what he is doing AFTER he begins a new movement. His instruction lags behind the video, this causes the viewer to get confused.Also, I was really put off by all the pseudo spiritual stuff. While I understand the concepts of Chi, I felt like he was getting real preachy.I prefer to just get on with the form."
5,Great album,"I purchased this after hearing the ""Totentanz"" track. I was pleasantly surprised to find the rest of the album is fantastic as well. The tracks on ""Variations"" are diverse. If you like bond or Vanessa-Mae's ""dance"" versions of classical pieces, you'll like all of Maksim's albums. This is an import so it's a bit of a wait on the shipping, but well worth the extra time."
3,Maksim Variations,Music is great but the quality of the CD is not very good. The disc. keep jumping and skip during a song. It said on the find print this only happen if you played the CD in the car. But I play at home and it still doing that.
3,"Good solid toy, but boring","OK, this toy is put together well and seems interesting...to me. But to my dog, he just doesn't touch it...like ever. If my dog doesn't like it, then it is worthless..."
3,Dogs Enjoy but not Durable,"Although the dogs really enjoy this bone, the purple raised bumps started coming off as soon as the dogs started chewing on it. Won't purchase again."
2,a little big for my 15 pound dog,this toy is wayyy big for my dog. the bacon smell came from the 2mm hole on both side of this toy. the smell is barely noticeable. i think its a bit pricey. my dog doesn't like it.
5,Great product...Great price!,I have two Pit Puppies that LOVE to chew and we finally found a toy they like and can't chew up in an hour!
1,Seems dangerous after use,"I had high hopes for this teeth cleaning ""bone"", but after a few weeks my 50lb. border collie was able to turn the ends from smooth to very sharp numerous spikes. Not only did it seems these spikes would pierce his gums, but some of the pieces were missing and they could only go one place, his stomach. I expected a better design from Hartz."
1,Not so good,"We prefer nylabone products but got this knowing it would be softer for our new puppy. We she had the center part torn up in no time and she was only about 10 weeks old. Our 9 year old lab got ahold of it for 2 minutes and snapped the thing literally in half, that was it. So I wouldn't buy it again because it won't last."
3,"Good quality, but pet does not like it for some reason",We have 3 dogs and all of them prefer their other chew toys over this one. Maybe the bacon flavor is not as good or reachable as they would prefer.
3,Dogs Love It (And EAT It),"My dogs haven't been big on chewing things that aren't edible. It's actually tough to find stuff they want to chew on and they LOVE these bones. But when they get down to the nub of this THEY EAT IT. EASILY. Debating whether or not I should buy again since inevitably, they eat whatever they're chewing on."
1,Broke my dog's teeth.,"My dog loves these toys. He would chew on them every day. Unfortunately, when I took him to the vet for his semi annual check-up, she informed me that his upper back molars on both sides were broken. He never showed any signs of pain so I had no idea, but she showed me and sure enough, they were broken and loose.When she asked me what he chews on, I told her we give him these bones and she said that nylon bones frequently cause broken teeth. So, $500 later, my 3 year old dog no longer has his 2 back molars.He loved these so much and I'm sad that he can't have his chewy bones anymore, but if I had ever known that these could actually break a dogs teeth, I would have never given them to him."
4,Tough chewer loves it!,My dog is a huge fan of toys and I guess one with bacon flavor makes it even more attractive! Rawhide makes him very sick but my dog loves this bone while he won't sit with it for hours he does chew on it regularly. I definitely saw an improvement on the amount of tarter build up. I give him a dentastix and still brush but this is a nice help to lessen the burden.
5,Price WAY too high. $5 at Walmart,"I have 3 large dogs all over 80 lbs and one 20 lb Rat Terrier mix mutt. The product is great but $8, bad price! I can buy for $5 at Walmart."
5,great for super chewing labs!,We love these bones and so do our 2 chocolate labs! We have used these products for years and we keep on buying them. They seem to last us 2-3 months until our dogs have chewed them to the point of eating huge pieces and then they go to the trash. (many other chew toys have been ruined in 5 minutes-1 day so these lasting more than a week is awesome to us!) We used to pay $9.99 each at our local grocery store and thank goodness I found them on Amazon only $7.99 each and buy 3 get the 4th free plus free s/h! What an awesome deal!!!! I can't say enough about this product except I am going to stock up on some more!
4,"DON""T TRY TO TIE TO SEE WHAT IT DOES#2","this game is way cool.but,don't try to tie to see what it does.also don't try to get to 1,000 points to see what it does.it takes a long long long time.it does not get that hard even in firebolt level.but it's still awesome!please somebody vote that this review was helpful.please.it's really cool on this game when you do a special move.i wish though that it was a little more harder."
1,Totally boring,"This game has great graphics, I admit, but it gets boring really quickly. It's too easy for words, and you just have to keep scoring goals, over and over again until it's time for you to catch the Snitch. They could've done better."
4,Awesome game,"At first this game is extremely boring because it is as though the other teams aren't trying. In most games you beat the other team by about 300 points, but once you get out of Hogwarts and play in the world cup, it gets much more difficult and more fun.[I can't beat Japan yet because of their seeker - but I just got the game two hours ago]. The stadiums are amazingly well detailed and the game has pretty good graphics. All-in-all it's a great game if you're a Potter fan."
3,A worthy effort,"If you're a fan of the books and movies, you'll probably like Quidditch World Cup. The gameplay is fairly challenging, the visuals are stunning, and some of the special moves are pretty spectacular. However, the game is not without flaws. It's wayyyy too easy at the lower levels, especially at the Hogwarts games. It's all too easy to score goals, and it can be annoyingly easy to control the results of the match. I've deliberately set games up to result in draws, and after an hour or so it was easy to win at Hogwarts by at least 500 points. Also, Quidditch was designed to be played in three dimensions. It wouldn't have been too hard to build a game to handle it; we've been making flight simulators for years. Oh well. It's still an enjoyable game, for all its flaws, and worth ten bucks. Maybe we can look forward to QWC2 sometime soon."
4,THIS GAME SUCKS,THIS GAME SUCKS THIS GAME SUCKS THIS GAME SUCKS THIS GAME SUCKS THIS GAME SUCKS THIS GAME SUCKS THIS GAME SUCKS THIS GAME SUCKS THIS GAME SUCKS THIS GAME SUCKS THIS GAME SUCKS
3,Harry Potter Quidditch,"This game is only good for Harry Potter fans. I bought it a while ago, and have found it extremely playable and fun. The multiplayer action is also good. The only downside is that it is hard to collect quidditch cards after you have collected the first twenty or so, the matches themselves are quite long, even with combos, and its very topical. You also need to know the rules of quidditch, or learn them, to play this game. However, for hard-core Harry potter fans, this game is a must. It is easy to control and a simple enough game to play."
5,Great Game - very entertaining,This is a great game and it keeps my kids entertained for hours. It is worth every penny.
4,great great great game,this game is awesome! it has great game play alot of diffrent teams and 4 diffrent brooms.over all i would have given tis game 100 stars. the only bad part is the world cup has 18 rounds.
2,Not the best game out there....,This is a fun game but it certanly has magor problems. I like the quidditch better than any other game but truly it is just not fun. This game is one only fans should buy for the notoriety.
4,Aewuseme game (i know my spelling is wrong i don't care,this game is so cool i haven't played it on Ps2 but i have on gamecube but i want to get it on Ps2
2,It gave me a reason to buy a PS2,"The day JK Rowling invented Quidditch for the books, this game was begging to be created. I'm absolutly getting it. I was ready to give up video games when I found out they were making a Quidditch game. This is the game I've been waiting for. Yes, I'm a Harry Potter nut, so the opportunity to play Quidditch was one I could not pass up. And unlike the other Harry Potter games, this one takes you beyond Hogwarts and into the Wizard world with it's favorite sport. I knew it was time to invest in a good system for the game, so I'm finally getting a PS2. I mean how can anyone, especially a Harry Potter fan, pass up the opportunity to play this awesome sport?"
1,buy other harry potter games,"This installment of the harry potter games is nothing short of completely bizzare. I have no idea how anybody could like it, although it is a perfect game for 2-3 year olds."
3,please know what your talking about,"i saw a review say ""this game sucks"" 12 times in all caps, I just wish I knew why this game sucked so much,especially since he later wrote it is a bad game even for ""tue"" (i believe he ment true) harry potter fan, try reading the books, just don't stop on the first two pages. I'm one and 12 have more common sense then this guy. Not quite sure what to rate game, it made me rate so I put in the middle."
2,Generic amateur punk,"See, I know the Offspring are sellouts and all that, but at least their singer knows how to be loud and high-pitched without just being noisy and generally obnoxious. There's a very good reason why the Teddybears have guest singers on later albums rather than singing themselves.The album right after this one, ""I can't believe it's Teddybears STHLM"", at least has a good punk cover of the Kraftwerk classic ""The Robots"". This dreck, however, isn't even worth having for completeness' sake."
1,Not actually in stock - discontinued,"I don't know if this speaker is any good or not, but don't try to buy it from here. I tried twice and both times about 4 days after I had ordered it (and the first time ordered the matching satellite speakers) I received an e-mail from Amazon saying it was currently out of stock so they were cancelling my order and I should try again later. Well I checked back a week or so later and it showed in stock but the same thing happened after I ordered it. I sent an e-mail to Parts Express (who is actually the seller, not amazon) and they said it had been discontinued (they also said they had no record of my order...strange). Anyways now I'm stuck with the satellite speakers with no matching center. By the way I haven't seen the center speaker in stock anywhere else since."
5,Stunning!,"This CD came and went without much fanfare. Why? You've got me. When I purchased this CD I fell in love with it immediately. It was no longer available and I bought through Amazon's marketplace from Kleen Kutz. This is one album I will always listen to. The music is haunting, romantic, deep, longing and soulful. I've turned on so many people to this album now. Paul Schwartz should be kissed and made a national Icon for this CD alone."
4,"Dreamy, ethereal, somewhat spacey","What struck me first about this album was how well the sounds blended with each other - it sounds like this could have been the techno spiffed-up remix of a quieter new age album. The synthetics really help make the songs spectacular and bring out the pleasant, creative melodies in each of them. I don't think I'll be getting sick of the tunes for a while. Another thing to be noted are the haunting vocals, from the bittersweet voice that sings ""Nevermore"" to the energetic and mysterious lyrics of ""In the Dark."" If only the lyrics had made more sense I would give this album five stars, but the simply great musicality in the songs is more than enough to sway you over. This is great music for listening while reading fantasy."
3,Average,"While a BIG fan of Aria 2: New Horizons ... I found Earthbound to be bland and was disappointed with the album as a whole. I am new to his music and found some of the past reviews for Earthbound misleading. Overall: more oppresive, less uplifting.Anyone commenting, please feel free to point us to the more climactic and better written work (I highly recommend Aria 2)."
4,Night,"This is lovely night music, inspired by loss and meditation. My favorite tracks are Tara MacLean's vocals on ""Earthbound"", and Lisbeth Scott on ""River of Stars"". There will be another State of Grace CD featuring Lisbeth, to be released in 2003."
4,Paul Schwartz unbound,"I discovered Mr. Schwartz's music by accident, but I'm willing to go anywhere he takes me - either to opera (ARIAS 1, 2, 3) or to the heights of ecclesiastical ecstasy (STATE TO GRACE 1, 2, 3).Definitely worthy."
1,Skip this Tosca,"This is just about the worst opera performance I've ever seen. I thought I couln't have too many Toscas either. Wrong! Buying this was a waste of money. Cura is mediocre at best and Patane is just embarrassing! Terrible voice! The acting was lousy as well. Cura is often looking amused at the wrong times and wonder if he found this entire thing a fiasco as well. He seemed to be laughing internally at Patane's performance, (if you can call it a performance). The only surprise is that anyone liked this Tosca at all. Any other Tosca is better than this and the original movie with Domingo is perhaps still the best available on video."
1,Simply dreadful....,"Cura has been advertised as being a protege of Domingo. He's not. That was just hype. I had bought his first CD, his voice showing no timbre at all and really unattractive. However, I thought, well, heck, I'll give him another try and one cannot have too many Toscas. Now I have one too many. This version must have been done on a shoe string, it is spare, to say the least and so is the singing. Ms. Pantane is little better than Mr. Cura and her singing is, like his, more in the nature of screaming although she does have a bit of timbre. An altogether displeasing DVD and one I hesitate to give away in case someone might think it was a decent Tosca."
1,Shame on KULTUR,"I cannot believe that in 2001, a major opera DVD company like KULTUR would release a DVD of TOSCA that is NOT in stereo !!!!!! It's disgraceful. I contacted KULTUR to question them regarding this ""faus pax"", and NEVER received a reply."
4,ORGASMIC ..........,"For want of a better word ~ that's this stellar production in a nutshell. Decor, costumes, voices, conducting ..... this one shows clearly that you don't need mega-stars, just pure commitment to the subject, to shine!FRANCESCA PATANE ignites the senses as does JOSE CURA with this near perfect union of their vocal and dramatic talents. very much along the lines of a May/June/December affair ~ with RENATO BRUSON as the chilly, sad Scarpia.Minor flaws? The slight commedia touches provided by the rest of the cast, but that's somewhat traditional and to be expected.Excellently presented in wide-screen, superior sound and vivid color choices {RECORDED 'LIVE'}.NOT to be missed.Now if only Patane and Cura would record CARMEN ........"
3,Mediocre,"It's not bad. It's not good, but it's not bad. The singing is good, if not fantastic, except in the case of Scarpia, where it is quite fantastic. It lacks, however, in the staging aspects. The acting of Scarpia is very convincing, but Cura's acting as Cavaradossi is very mediocre, and the Prima Donna's is downright laughable. The stage people decided to base the opera in 1800, but the hair people decided Cura should come from 1995. The conducting is shaky in terms of its commitment to the score. The sets are quite good, very convincing, and the lights and sound seem well organized. All in all, a well-deserved three stars, but nothing more."
1,Not very useful,This book offers little more than a list of words with no other information. It doesn't provide any guide to pronunication or usage and doesn't give the gender for nouns. I was also unable to find entries for some very common words and have spotted a few errors along the way. I recommend spending a little extra for the New Routledge Dutch Dictionary; it's much better.
4,Amazing!,"I agree with a previous reviewer - I'd love to see City Boy get back together again. If Steve Broughton (Lunt), Mike Slamer, Lol Mason, Chris Dunn, Roy Ward and Max Thomas could get back in the studio and get that synergy going again - the music world (and the fans) would benefit ten-fold.This is the band's last album with the Steve Broughton (an excellent singer/songwriter)and it's one of their best. While the title track is a standout, my favorite is ""New York Times"" -a beautiful, melodic song, followed by ""Machines"".Well worth the price. If you've bought the Anthology and liked what you heard, get this. I'll echo all the other reviers: You'll wonder why this band never made it BIG."
5,Smooth relaxing enjoyable music,The CD arrived quickly. Perfectly packaged. Was a great deal for the price. The music is entertaining and relaxing acoustic guitar music. Made a perfect gift.
4,Peaceful...,"Enjoyable, soothing Christmas music. I especially love ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman."" I would purchase this disc again."
5,"Loved Sarah Brightman, Loved Enya, but this album beats them both","Okay so this is probably the last Christmas album I am going to get this season, but I think it is the best. I have gotten Sarah Brightman's, Enyas, and Yo Yo Mas, but I have to say this is the best out of the bunch. It may be recycled music, but this is my first windam hill christmas album so it is all new to me. It is quiet but not boring. The players here masterfully play the guitar. The songs are both relaxing and exciting. This album will be the perfect music for parties, wrapping and opening presents, cooking, baking, whatever your hearts desire this christmas. Enjoy I sure will!!!"
1,LOVE this cd!!,"Absolutely gorgeous music!! So beautiful and soothing to the soul. I, would, and have, reccomended to anyone to play during the holidays or anytime! I'm still playing it and it's almost February!"
4,Quite complete!,"This three-volume, behemoth of a bible on reptile care and medicine covers almost any topic you can think of or might encounter, either as a herpetoculturist, veterinary nurse or veterinarian.Although some topics lack detail, this is understandable considering the sheer size of the books and the vast amount of subjects that are touched. Sometimes a little extra research will be needed if you want to know more, but for most purposes, this set is more than adequate.The only deterrant is its price (and maybe its weight!), however it is well worth the money."
3,So-So blender cookbook,"This is a good book; it will give you inspirations to try different ""blends"" on your own. I expected to see more ""healthful"" blends for some reason (my only compliant)."
4,good but at a price,This car kit is the most expensive I've ever seen. It works great and shipping was quick. So all said I'm satisfied but It's priced way too high!
1,Product didn't work,I could not get the XM radio to modulate with my cars FM radio. I also have a Delphi XM radio and have had no problems. I followed the directions to the letter.
5,A fantastic season and the DVD itself,"This is such a good F1 season. Well, as we know that this is the first season after the F1 legend Michael Schumacher retired from the sport. This 2007 F1 season is such a bomb. As three drivers battled for the title, the whole season is in a very explosive excitement.Season: As everybody knows, 2007 season is a very exciting season saw a three driver's battle toward the end. Kimi Raikkonen won the championship by just 1 point.The DVD: This is a very tremendous DVD because it is the first time to present this video in a widescreen format. I feel it is very ""real"" because it is more like that I am watching a ""real"" documentary movie. The visual is so great."
5,Detailed Book,I bought this book for my husband after we had seen many of the works of Durer at Biltmore.He is enjoying it.
5,The Pill Book (12th Edition),"This is a great ""Home"" family resourse. It seems to be very complete and informative for the medical/pharmacy novice."
5,A Must Have Medicine Book!,"You can look up medications online, but why tie up your phone line, and take a while searching the sites to find information on medication, when you can just open the book up in a minute and find what you want(FAST!) This book has alot of info on medicines that the pharmacies didn't even tell me about. This is a Great book to lay in bed with and search up all the medicines that you have taken in the past, or are currently taking. It has All the information about all the dangers of taking it with other medications, What the side effects are, Descriptions, and EVERYTHING you would ever Want to know about the medicine. It's a smaller book thats easy to carry and take with you, anywhere. This book has it all, Pictures, brand names, generic names and side effects of the medication, Etc, etc, etc..This book is a MUST HAVE book! It's worth every cent! I give this book an ""A"""
5,The most useful of all the books that tell you about pills.,"I was able to find out more about the drugs I take from this book than from any doctor or pharmacist I have ever talked to. It tells you about drugs you shouldn't mix with each other, foods to avoid and lots of other important facts."
5,A necessity for every family's library!,"The Pill Book is one of the most informative and easy to read reference books for laymen. It equips the patient with much valuable information on what the drug is prescribed for, its side effects and food/drug interactions. My only critique would be that in the 8th edition, which I currently have, pregnancy is addressed without specifying the risk category; information that I feel is important. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the book--it's very evident by the wear and tear it has received from much reading! A definite must-have for all households."
3,COULD BE BETTER,"I BOUGHT THIS TO REPLACE A VERY MUCH OLDER ADDITION. I'M A PHARMACY TECHNICIAN AND LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT SOME MEDICATIONS AS WELL AS GET INFORMATION ON MEDICATIONS I TAKE. THE MAIN REASON I DIDN'T GIVE IT 4 OR 5 STARS IS THAT IT LEAVES OUT MANY OLDER, BUT STILL FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS. THE OTHER THING I DON'T LIKE IS THAT IT LUMPS A LOT OF MEDICATIONS IN THE SAME FAMILY INTO ONE HEADING. THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO SORT THROUGH ALL OF THE INFORMATION TRYING TO FIND THE THINGS THAT APPLY SPECIFICALLY TO THE MEDICATION YOU WANT INFORMATION ON. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT INFO ON CIPRO (CIPROFLOXACIN), YOU ALSO HAVE TO WEED THROUGH THE INFORMATION ON FLOXIN, LEVAQUIN AND OTHERS TO FIND THE INFORMATION THAT MAY APPLY ONLY TO CIPRO."
2,Disappointment,"I bought this book to have a guide to medicines, but many of prescriptions utilized by my family are not included in the book, and those that are are arranged in such a difficult manner that it is hard to determine the correct medication name and to read the information I was hoping to find."
4,Primer for all families and clinicians...,"I use this book regularly with patients. The pictures help patients identify which medications they are taking, thereby giving me the mg. and doseage. When taking history, the amount of medical information needed can be critical to care and this book helps aid in that process.It's a good patient friendly primer."
5,The Pill Book review,"This is a very user-friendly and inexpensive guide that we use in training all of our group home staff who must assist with medication administration. There is a copy in nearly every one of our facilities (150+).It's flaw is that it becomes outdated fairly quickly so must be replaced every few years. However, since the cost is minimal, that's possible."
1,Why Buy what webmd.com does for free,"Not to be a wet towel, but why buy this book, as I did, thinking is was better info than WEBMD.COM......and that was free. Unless you need to see what each pill looks like, stick to the free web."
1,Grossly Overpriced - Do not waste your money,"I have been an avid user of NIVEA replenishing post shave balm for years. I pay under $6.00 for a 3.3 fluid ounce bottle. I decided to give the Proraso after shave a try because of all the reviews. I tried the Proraso aftershave for a week and I am very disappointed. First, there is barley any scent to it unlike the scented NIVEA. Second, the Proraso is more watery than the NIVEA. Finally, I did not notice any better result or feel using the Proraso. I did expect that for $17 for 3.4 fluid ounces that I would get a better feel and result from the aftershave. I am guessing that the reason for the high price is due to the cost of importing it here to the States. Save your money. There are better alternatives out there for much less money."
1,Terrible...just terrible,"The bottle is extremely poorly constructed, to the point that the bottle cap doesn't screw on properly to the bottle. As a result, cream gets everywhere.In addition, it has a rather faint smell that is not particularly pleasant."
2,"Dissapointed, especially for the size and price","Bottle is way too small.. you will need a decent amount of lotion to cover your face. Face will still feel tight if you dont put enough on, so the bottle wont last you very long. honestly i prefer the cheap alchohol based ""SkinBracer"" aftershave over the Proraso.. funny since I have very sensitive skin.."
1,harmful ingredients,Contains multiple types of parabens. I will not use harmful ingredients on my skin.Trading comfort for cancer is not an option.
4,Great aftershave,This aftershave is alright. It has a very discreet smell of soap and the cream is long lasting. It also absorbes into the skin very fast so you can apply other products almost immediately.The only similar product I've tried (except really cheap brands like Nivea or Gillette) is the aftershave gel from Biotherm. I must say I like Proraso more.
2,"Not original product, image misleading","The is not the original Proraso liquid cream aftershave product. This smells like Tea Tree oil and flowers and is in a square bottle, not the flask-shaped bottle. I hate this new smell. Beware!"
4,Soothing and not Greasy,I have been using this daily now for the last month since switching to shaving with a double edged safety razor. It goes on light and soaks in quickly. Seems similiar to Nivea but maybe a little milkier. No stinging or greasy feeling from this stuff. What this does for me most importantly is keeps my razor burn down to nothing. The scent is very very mild and dissipates quickly. I have normal skin and this moisturizes perfectly.
2,Not the same product as my 1st purchase,"It appears that either Proraso has changed their formula or there are 2 different items with similar names. The 1st purchase came in a hip-flask like bottle with a green cap and contained witch hazel (as shown in photo at Amazon). The 2nd order was is a shorter bottle with a black cap and different ingredients, not containing witch hazel. The witch hazel was what I liked about the product helping to close your pores. I will probaly send back this 2nd order and see if I can find the original product. (Unfortunatly the Proraso site is in Italian, so i couldn't determine if they changed the formula).UPDATE; I was able to determine that the Proraso formula has changed. Too bad, I really liked that product. It remains to be seen if the new formula is as good."
2,Not the product pictured,"This is not the product as pictured. The one pictured is the previous formulation - the one which was delivered is the new formulation (tea trea), which comes in a square bottle. Unfortunately I don't like the new formulation nearly as much and the bottle is smaller. Not sure why Proraso changed it, but be aware that you aren't ordering what is in the picture."
4,Not too bad.,"I wanted the old formula because it was the one shown in the picture. However, I received the new formula. It works well on my sensitive skin, though I do prefer the new formula Proraso Green Aftershave. This, however, is better than Geo. F. Trumper's Lime Skin Food."
5,Great product,Aftershave is great for irratation and redness. It absorbs quickly and leaves skin silky smooth. Doesn't have a strong scent so you could apply some aftershave cologne if you wanted to. Not much product is necessary to use so this bottle will last me quite a awhile.
5,Job well done,"I bought this aftershave wanting something that didn't sting, and smelled nice. That's exactly what I got. It works like it's supposed to. I have read where some people say it made them break out (?), but then again - I'm an italian using an italian product, so maybe it's better suited for me. I love it and now only use Proraso products (shave soap as well). Viva Italia!"
4,Best Balm Around,Started using Proraso products since visiting Italy all their products are used by the majority of barbers in Italy.Prorasos line of shaving supplies are the best in the world as far as quality goes.You get what you pay for.Everytime I shave the Proraso balm or aftershave smell remind me of mornings in Tuscany.
2,Not 'Classic' Proraso Smell,"Please beware Proraso lovers: This scent is radically different from the wonderful Proraso shave cream. I have been using Proraso shaving cream in the green tube for six years now, and decided to try this product to match. The scent was noxious to me, even borderline foul.The product does make your skin feel wonderful, but it is thin and watery to me. I had to rate it low for the scent alone. Also note that everyone's olfactory senses are entirely different, so to you, this may be a delightful scent. Just don't think that it is in any way the same smell as the Proraso shave cream."
3,"Light, but may require second coat","I purchased this after-shave after a lot of research. I didn't want to spend mall prices for item's like ""The Art of Shaving"". I also have allergies, so I didn't want a heavy scented product either. I was lead to the Proraso Liquid Cream after-shave. It has a light scent, and coverage is descent. I did like that my face would dry up within a few minutes and require a second coating of the product to keep it feeling moisturized. Unfortunately I ended up spending the money on Twinluxe which was a LOT more expensive, however I only have to use a tiny bit and it lasts all day, without a greasy or heavy feel. Compared to store bought Nivea which was what I used prior, I prefer Proraso. I is definately and improvement to box store items, but still a ways to go."
2,Disappointed.,"I dunno, for $16, imported from Italy, I expected something...special. Its ok, but seems not that much different from local cheaper brands to me. (Maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough to tell the difference...)"
5,Another excellent Proraso product,"I own this product along with the Proraso shaving cream and its the best after shave lotion on the market today. Proraso has high quality products that are the first that have never caused me the get razor bumps or skin rash. I normally dont shave everyday because my skin is so poor for shaving, but with Proraso products I could definitely do it."
1,Picture Is Not The Same As The Product Shipped,"The product as pictured was the old version, which is what I really wanted. The new reformulated product is what shipped."
3,Proraso liquid cream after-shave,"I heard they reformulated their liquid cream after shave, they missed the mark on the new formula. I liked the old formula better."
4,Great stuff,As advertised...not greasy wont clog the pores and soothes and moisturizes the skin. Proraso makes high quality products at a good price
5,nice soothing and light,"I used Nivea for sensitive skin before I switched to Truefitt and Hill ultimate comfort. truefitt ultimate comfort has been the best aftershave for sensitive skin with no questions. But for warmer days when I need a lighter, but soothing aftershave I use Proraso. Proraso is less dense so I need a couple of coats. The scent is very light and not overpowering. I think this is a good aftershave one step up from Nivea."
5,Great Buy,"My skin is extremely sensitive and I get razor burns and ingrown hairs very easily. I can't stand alcohol-based skin products so I was really happy to discover this after-shave. It feels extremely smooth, smells nice and provides a nice moisturizing feeling. Highly recommended."
5,Very creamy,"Gives you very good moisture without being greasy. Soothes skin well. The scent is very light and non-intrusive. I use this in combination with Proraso shaving cream, and they work together wonderfully. But I am sure this balm is able to stand on its own just as well."
4,Fantastic product,This stuff smells incredible and soothes the burn and leaves the skin ultra smooth after shaving. My only complaint is the high price.
5,Great comfort after shave.,"I use this after every shave and it soothes and moisturizes the skin perfectly. Just a dime sized dab is all you need, so it will last a good while. I love the mild clean fragrance of this after shave, leaves your face in good shape after a shave. I will definetly use this from now on."
4,Soothing but too fragrant for me,"I have been using this for about a week. This product is quite soothing on the skin, and I like it for that. However, I am a man who prefers not to wear any scent, and I find the floral fragrance too strong for my taste. The fragrance does dissipate, but not as quickly or completely as I had expected from other reviews.So, although the stuff feels good on the skin, I won't be ordering more of it. Perhaps I can find a similar, but unscented product; if not, I'll just use plain witch hazel."
2,Wish this worked,This is a cool set. Loved that it came with so many pieces. However the bridle broke immediately out of the packaging. Five minutes later the blanket straps broke. My 11yr old daughter collects breyers and is not rough with toys. This is a really neat set just wish it could actually be used on a Breyer.
3,"O.K but,","this is an ok toy. it is cute, but it made out of a soft material. you should get a different saddle"
1,Not worth purchasing,"Bought this DVD for my Dad who is a Red Skelton fan from years ago. He said the first DVD was fine, but the others were just plain bad - not even worth watching. Very disappointing since this was a birthday gift."
1,Red Skelton Collection,"I returned this item due to the fact that it was a duplicate gift. I bought it as a gift for my dad, but I had already purchased it previously for him. He really enjoyed my first purchase."
2,Really?,"Wow! All these good reviews. Frankly I thought the narrative was a mess. It only evades one star because Marlowe does, indeed, give us a wonderful examination of the Poe's marriage and ""real life"".The biographical aspects are well done. The point, I suppose, was to view inside Poe's mind at the end. Frankly it was so confusing the tragic end of Poe gets hopelessly lost in the prose.The rest? The first half was much easier to follow than the second half. Honestly I finished the book because of the good reviews and because I have this thing about finishing books I have started. It was like reading jabberwocky. This is not a long book but I fought to finish it. Sorry I did not like it at all."
4,"slow at first, but very intrigueing .","Great book. A bit slow at first, hard to get into I think. As you read it more though, the book begins to develop around you and draw you in. I enjoyed it greatly. Being able to walk in Poe's footsteps, see through his eyes, you begin to wonder and imagine that you are Poe. The sheer historical and visual aspect of it is enough to capture the imagination and intrigue of anyone."
4,"Mesmerizing, confusing, poetic prose, historical.","I found the book hard to follow, and yet by the end I was strangely drawn to it - its bewildering account of the last days of Edgar Allan Poe. I plan to hang on to my copy and reread it later, if anything, just to figure out the plot(s)."
5,A milestone in the history of science and Romanticism,"In a recent review of a book on Frankenstein and the sciences, the historian of physics, Iwan Morus, commented that the fact that no one in that book cited Levere meant that the scholarship was basically wholly unsound. He has a point. This book is a milestone in the history of science and Romanticism, and it subtly demonstrates how chemistry infected Coleridge's thought in ways that one would not expect."
1,Outrageously priced!,This is a nice Thanksgiving set of stickers....but $8 is WAY TOO much to pay for it.
3,Life as we know it........,"Frederick has just moved to California from Wisconsin. His first day of school he meets Xio. They immediately become fast friends and she introduces him to her friends called ""the sexies"". As they become closer it is obvious that Xio wants to be more than friends. Frederick likes her but for some reason he is not feeling the same attraction. So starts this book where one of the main characters (Frederick) battles back and forth wondering why I am not attracted to this young lady but yet when he sees one of his classmates Victor he daydreams about him. It is a coming of age book where each individuals have to face grown up facts. Frederick that this feeling he has makes him a strong candidate of being homosexual, and Xio who has to come to terms with her father leaving the family and her father too possibly being gay. Great read."
3,"Original Gameplay = 3, Replayability = 0","Although this game can be fun to play the first time through, it has virtually no replayability. The boards are totally static, so there's not even any exploration factor after the first time through, and the ""upgrades"" really aren't that spectacular.I found I had absolutely no desire to go back and replay the game once I'd beaten it, and without a 2-player vs mode, it'll probably just collect dust on my shelf for quite awhile now."
4,A Great Mulit-Player Game,"I found Return of the King to be a great game. It is loads of fun in multi-player mode. Graphics are top-notch and the all the scenes draw you in. The game can be very challenging, and does take time to beat. The best part of the multi-player mode is that after solving the game, you can choose any of the characters and replay any level. After solving the game I continue to play it. This is a game that will take a long time to get old. It reflects the movie well and like i said before the graphics are outstanding."
2,Pretty Bad...,"At first, being able to choose almost the entire Fellowship is pretty cool. The first 3 levels are wut Two Towers mainly was, challenging, but not hard. Once you beat Path to Isengard, Path of the Wizard (Gandalf's levles) are brutal. The main factor to losing is the inability to run straight ahead. I've had to try Top of the Wall over 5 times and still no success b/c You can only run when angled. Another poor factor to the game is u can only replay levels once u beat the last level (Crack of Doom). If you don't mind endless tries on levels and the awful secret characters (Merry in Rohan armor, Pippin in Gondor armor, and Faramir). Note: Unlike the Two Towers game, you have to have beaten the game to use cheats like Restore Helth, Arrows, etc."
4,One of my favorites!,"I fell in love with this game the first time I played it. The graphics and the sounds are incredible. The gameplay if fun. It keeps you interested especially since they have three different paths to follow, as well as several different players you can do it with. I play it with my son so having it play in co-op mode is a HUGE benefit and source of enjoyment.My only gripe is that if you are playing by yourself, it is sometimes hard to build up a player. Locking the game behind you as you progress is really disappointing.Other than that, fantastic!!!! Highly recommended. A huge improvement over the Two Towers game. I love this game!!"
4,Challenging but fun,This is really fun! It is hard at first but as you get better moves it is easier. It is fun(and in some places a little boring especially when you fight gollum.) At the end you unlock players and go to any level. You do that for some time and then you get tired of the game. Overall Really great game that is awesome for LOTR fans.
3,Exciting,"Yes, the game was exciting, fun, and the graphics were outstanding...yet, it was far too short. Now, I've heard people call games short before, and never seemed to agree. Return of the King consists of three paths - one for Gandalf, one for the hobbits, and one for Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Each path has around 5 or 6 levels, all of which are fairly difficult, but exciting and action packed. The only two problems I had with the game were; Far too short, and the base of the game was action. If you like Lord of the Rings, enjoyed ""The Two Towers"", then you will surley enjoy this game.Graphics: 5/5Gameplay: 4/5Sound: 5/5Value: 3-4/5Overall: 4.5My personal oppinion is a bit lower, but this game deserves the above rating."
4,One Game To Rule Them All,"This game is one of the best games out there. You get to choose between Gandalf, Sam, Gimli, Aragorn, and Legolas and with your character, save middle earth. You can unlock three more characters in the game and it's worth it. The co-op is a great feature in this game and there's nothing as much fun as saving middle earth with a friend in this game. The music is wonderful, the graphics are beautiful, and gameplay can't get much better.It's only downside is that there's not that many levels.This game rocks."
4,very entertaining but is to easy to beat,this game is very entertaining. the sountract and graphics are incredible. it is very easy to play.You can even play as the hobbits. the downfall to this game is that it is to easy to beat.
5,one of the best games ever,"I just got this game and it's cool. The game is similar to the second but you get to play all the characters. The game is also hard but not that hard. You can pick which difficulty mode you want, theres easy, normal, and hard. The game is a must have for any fan and extreme gamer. The only flaw is the price of the game. Its just too much but worth it. If you are the gamer that doesen't like the price you may want to wait because the game will lower it's price pretty soon because the secon game is already lowered its price."
4,"The Lord Of The Rings, The Return Of The King",The Lord Of The Rings is a must have game for any real gamer. The game is awesome. I bought the game the first day out on Gamecube and I havent stopped playing it. A really great game for a hardcore Lord Of The Rings FAN LIKE ME!!
5,I absolutely LOVE this game!!,"I usually don't play games much and I usually avoid 'hack and slash' games, but this one is very fun! I have to say that is a pretty hard game. I have made it through on easy, normal, and hard, but I still have trouble with the palantirs of Sauron and Saruman without cheats. While it can be extremely frustrating to finish the game; the pure fun comes from re-playing all those levels with different characters and building your characters up to the highest experience level (which is 20). When you're that high, you can just plow through anybody on any level. I very much enjoy the levels of Minas Tirith (Top of the Wall and The Courtyard) just because they are incredibly crazy with non-stop action. I never get tired of playing The Pelennor Fields and the Black Gate; they are just so much fun and intense. A very good game that keeps me coming back for more even though I finished it."
4,The Return of the King is for sure the king of all games.,"The game itself is perfect,except for the speed of the characters on which the two towers game they were faster.But that I think makes it more realistic. The graphics, the controls, the story line, the characters, the interviews, and clips from the movie contribute to the game to make it worth your money. Passed the game in less than two days. Hopefully the trilogy game will be harder to pass. Can't wait to see if the game will come out on the console that I have."
2,"Attractive book, but poorly structured and edited","This book is sort of odd. It starts off as a brisk chapter by chapter ode to elements of adobe houses. But it ends with an inordinate amount of space dedicated to one contemporary house that is somewhat related to the houses discussed throughout the bulk of the book.Not enough space is spent discussing any one element of adobe houses, so it should be considered something of a small, short coffee table book.I liked the book I don't really even understand why the word ""small"" is in the title since it doesn't even discuss the concept of small houses in any seriousness.Its most redeeming feature is that it has attractive photographs."
1,Poor Choice,"In comparison to other books available about adobe houses, the content of this book offers little range and depth. Other choices were less superficial."
5,"Great, cheap way to make shoes more comfortable","Got shoes that are a little too big or don't have a comfortable enough sole? Then this is the product for you! These can even be used for sandals. With their sticky bottom and small profile, there's little risk of them showing or slipping."
4,This book is a great preparation,I really loved this book because it prepared me for everything. The only thing that would have made it 5 stars is if it was a longer book. It hits every topic I could think of.
5,A tremendous achievement,"Linda Argote not only summarizes what is know about organizational learning but also integrates her own creative research into the mix. Her research on pizza franchises is legendary, and in this book she shows why. Using innovative methods in shipyards, truck factories, airplane factors, pizza shops, and elsewhere, Argote derives propositions and puts them to the test.I particularly liked her discussion of organizational memory and forgetting. What a great notion -- organizations CAN forget things! -- and Argote shows just how quickly that can happen.This book belongs on the shelf of every scholar and manager interested in how organizations learn (and forget)."
1,The marketing of this CD is a fraud,"The performance is just fine, but Amazon has mis-described the product. Mozart's Violin Concerto Number 1 is NOT in D Major; it is in B Flat, not D Major. Violin Concerto No. 1 is B-flat major, K. 207 (1775)). This CD contains instead the Violin Concerto in D, KV271i, which is probably NOT by Mozart. See, for example, [...]"
3,"Paul Rodgers Is The True ""Voice Of Rock""","Quick and to the point. Paul Rodgers is one of, if not thee best rock vocalist ever. That said the lead guitar on this album flat our sucks. No lead fills or solos on ""Feel Like Making Love""? You'll know I'm right when you listen to some of the songs and are waiting...and waiting...and waiting for those classic Mick Ralph's lead fills. Especially on ""Making Love"".Let's hope Bad Co recruits a guitarist who will be able to fill Ralph's shoes."
5,I am so thankful that I can own this now!,"We have watched this the past 2 years, being released in 2009. I was just lamenting the fact that I couldn't find it being broadcast on my local stations this Halloween Season. But now! Here it is.If you liked the original movie, this holds all of the fun, light thrills and goofy comedy as the original. All the characters are present and a few more. The Mstant Pumpkins are hilarious, growing bigger and stronger by eating Halloween candy.This is only a 22 minute TV Show, so don't be disappointed by the short length. It was originally just aired on TV. But its worth it. Not too scary but not The Great Pumpkin kind of tame. (and lame, in my opinion).Enjoy!"
3,Great fun!,"A new collection of live music (mostly) from 4 heavy metal bands: John Kay And Steppenwolf, Blue Oyster Cult, Foghat and Pat Travers. John Kay's ""Bad Attitude"" is a story about a visit to a McDonald's, where he asks, ""Do I get a free stomach pump with this order?"" B.O.C. do live versions of ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper"" and ""Godzilla""-and you'd think you'd get tired of hearing those again-but NO! This is, of course, the 1997 version of the band, who a year later released the staggeringly good HEAVEN FORBID album. In fact, ""Power Underneath Despair"" makes an early appearance here, though I don't think it was quite the ""finished"" mix yet."
3,A BETTER SUMMER JAM THAN MOST,"I don't have to listen to it because I was there! The reason they don't have FOOL FOR THE CITY is because the sound system failed. This was recorded at THE MARK in New Moline, IL. All the bands were much better than we expected. Pat Travers stood out. He is definitley a performance artist. Then came Foghat who were surprisingly fresh! Thats when the left speaker bank failed. Blue Oyster Cult did thier usual Sci-Fi stuff, and did it very, very well indeed. John Kay seemed to enjoy the proceedings more than anyone though. A fairly satisfying concert. But the reason songs are missing that you would expect to be there is because the speakers failed."
2,I was not pleased.,"I LOVE THE TRACK ""NO PUEDO ESTAR SIN TI"" (HARMONY MIX) EVER SINCE I HEARD IT BACK IN ""LA BOOM"" NIGHT CLUB AROUND EARLY 1998, BUT THE REST OF THE CD DOESN'T DO IT FOR ME. A COUPLE OF THE TRACKS DID NOT LIVE UP TO A GOOD MOENIA MIX THAT YOU ARE USED TO HEARING IN THE LOS ANGELES CLUBS. A COUPLE OF THE TRACKS WERE KIND OF ""TRIPPY"" SOUNDING TOO."
1,Disappointed!,"More elevator music than symphony. The chorus has got to go too, only the fab four can actually sing the songs in my opinion.Save your money on this one."
3,Leather stretches out,The Narrow size attracted me to this shoe however the leather stretches out making the shoe too loose.
4,Constantine's Columns ... Collected!,"Larry Constantine's columns on peopleware issues are finally compiled into this single volume.Although he shares the term ""peopleware"" with DeMarco and Lister's management classic ""Peopleware,"" Constantine's book doesn't focus solely on management and workplace issues. Inside you'll find his insights on user interfaces, team construction, tool use, group learning, and more.Because each chapter is a reproduction of an article previously published throughout various journals and at various times in Constantine's career, there's a lot of breadth. And it's easy to skip over things that aren't appropriate to your project or company. But each article is small, and it's easy to digest one or two a day while at work."
4,Good guide for IT manager's,"This book was recomended for me from my teacher (very very clever woman) in Uni. And i am very happy to have such one.Constantine shows to us, where is the problem in typical software development project. He brings to light all known problems, what are related to all managers. Fascinating, that we all know these problems, but we don't see it without a help from outside (in this case from Constantine).From other side i don't like some things, what Constantine has postulated. I disagree to his idea about ""cowboy's and cowgirl's"" and maverick's. But all other stuff is perfect."
5,GREAT book,"my nephew is into dinosours and we got this for him for Christmas. It was right up his ally, he roars right along!"
1,Too judgmental,"I borrowed this book from the library because my daughter loves Sandra Boynton's books. However, this book makes judgments on what is good (painting neatly) and bad (painting messily), and who is cute and who is not cute. I don't think such labels are appropriate to teach to young children. Being messy is not always bad. It can be a valuable learning experience. And you certainly don't need to teach children to judge people (or dinosaurs) by their looks."
5,my son's favorite,"Sandra Boyton truly is my favorite author for toddler/pre-school books. This title is a favorite of my son's. He asks me over and over, read it again please mommy. He now has it memorized! I would highly recommend this book to add to you Sandra Boyton collections."
5,Awesome Music,Fred Hammond's CD's never disappoint the purchaser. I enjoy being able to put a CD on and not have to skip any songs because I don't like them I enjoy this CD from start to finish.
3,FREE 2 WORSHIP- FRED HAMMOND,"NOT REALLY SURE WHERE FRED WAS GOING ON THIS ONE. I 'VE FOLLOWED HIS ""CAREER"" SINCE COMMISSIONED AND THIS WAS NOT HIS BEST EFFORT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S HARD 2 BALANCE MINISTRY/MUSIC/CREATIVITY WITH THE MONEY MAKING MACHINE THAT IS THE MUSIC INDUSTRY...2 ME, IT SOUNDED LIKE SONGS THAT WERE LEFT OVER FROM A FEW OTHER PROJECTS...AS MUCH AS I LOVE HIS MUSIC..I WAS NOT INSPIRED BY THIS ONE. SORRY."
3,Average,"This CD is ok. It just did not hit me like the other Fred Hammond albums. I found myself skipping tracks which is unusually for me. The ministry is there, but I did not feel the flavor of this album."
5,Two Thumbs Up!!!,"This is a great album. Fred really gave this one a unique twist, as usual, compared to his previous works. The music is awesome and the lyrics even better!! (AS USUAL)"
5,FREED2WORSHIP!!,"When you first listen to the CD, there is a tendancy to unfairly judge it by the opening numbers of others like ""He Lives"", ""Spirit of David"", etc. (which evokes immediate power). Then again, it's called ""Free to WORSHIP"" (smile). This CD is reminescent of a FH concert. (You owe to yourself to be in the midst of one). The whole thing is great, but the modulation on ""No Greater Love"" is Shekinah Glory/Throne Room material. Never - ever disappointed!"
3,Contemporary Praise!,"A decent effort from one of the best singer/songwriters contemporary gospel has to offer. ""Free to Worship"" won a Grammy for best contemporary gospel album and it features the uptempo dance tracks ""Keep on Praisin"" and the thumpin ""L.O.U.D L.O.U.D"". Fine production reigns supreme on ""More of you"" and on the worship tip, ""Thank you Lord, I won't complain"" and ""There is no place"" are extraordinary! In overall, this CD is not his best effort, but not his worst."
3,good music,"We are looking for reasonably priced alternative styles of gospel music. This is a really good CD. Price was right,l and will be ordering more of Fred Hammond."
5,Free to Worship,"The music came at the right time. Incidentally, I was looking for a certain song and didn't find it but was blessed by the cd!"
5,Best Fred CD,I have had this CD for some time now and I play it all the time. I think it is the best of all of Fred Hammond's CD's. I love it!
5,Awesome Fred!,I've been a Fred fan for years and this project is another to add to the collection. The music is straight from the heart nd the lyrics are biblical and glorify God. I love it and would highly recommend it.
4,Read this in the tub!,"Get away from it all with a glass of wine, some candle light and this book! Mrs. Small has carried on Skye O'Malley's family story in great fashion, with plenty of passion, history and humor. Find out what happens to the next generation of fiery, feisty O'Malley women! If you enjoyed All the Sweet Tomorrows, you'll love this!!"
3,"Worn-out phrases, words, and situations","Here's a list of things I have heard enough of in Bertrice Small's books, because she pads her books with them.#1. Not-so-royal Stuart.#2. ""And the rest is all trifles.""#3. There were artichokes braised in white wine...and a list of fifty different dead animals.#4. The wine is from Archambault.#5. Hae#6. Nae#7. Jesu!#8. The king wants you for his whore, and you have to do it or you'll dishonor your family.Here's another thing. I have just finished Besieged, and barely opened Intrigued. Right here at the beginning, it states that Henry married ""Rosamund"" when in Besieged, he had just married Cecily! She can't keep her characters straight! And what about that daughter Janet Skye, mentioned briefly at the end of Darling Jasmine, and then two books later there is a brief mention of a daughter who dies young? I think it was an afterthought, because Ms. Small forgot all about her."
1,Declining standards,"What a tedious pair! Neither the hero nor the heroine is at all interesting, and their decisions drag on and on and on. The tangential stories are no better, with little or no character development. Small must be writing to deadline, because her secondary characters are all repetitions of earlier characters.Lately, it seems as if each of Bertrice Small's books has been worse than its predecessor. She hasn't had an interesting heroine since the books focusing on Jasmine (and the last of those was pretty weak). Maybe it's time to let the O'Malley descendents rest in peace."
3,No longer Lust's Leading Lady,"I look forward to each new Bertrice Small book with extreme anticipation. I have especially enjoyed reading the continuing saga of the O'Malley family. However, since the original character Skye has died, her decendents have become quite boring (as compared to her). They no longer have the adventrues that Skye herself once did. I was especially disappointed that Fortune never did find out that Rory was her real father. That would have been reminisent of the Skye legacy.With each new book, I find myself to be in less of a hurry to buy the book. I do hope that if Bertrice Small does continue with the series Skye's Legacy, she puts a bit more zest into the stories."
3,A good solid effort,"While not one of Ms. Small's best works (The Kadin, Love Slave)it at least shows some imagination and does not immediately throw our heroine into a harem..There were two sub plots that slowed the story down...the kidnapping of Aine...and the servant girl in Mary's Land...but, Ms. Small did not dwell on this...Overall a pleasant diversion for a day...."
3,Disappointing,"Skye's legacy deserves a better story than the one delivered in this book. As Small has become a more mainstream author her characters have suffered - and so have her faithful readers. It seems each generation after Skye got a little more ""milk-toast."" This is a shame since Skye O'Malley was and will probably be the best character Small could imagine."
3,Besieged,"Ms Small is back on track with this tale of Skye O'Malley'sgreat-granddaughter Fortune Lindley. Fortune is a passionate,headstrong woman who stands up for her convictions. Jasmine her mother seems to have regained her backbone in this book. The hero Keiran is not quite as exciting as I had hoped for but at least his character didn't put me to sleep. This effort was better than the previous story, Bedazzled, about Fortune's older sister India. Ms. Small you have almost got that fire back into your stories maybe a revisit to your earlier heroines might spark the flame again."
2,It was a very dig DISAPOINTMENT,When I found out there was a book about Fortune I could not waite to read it. Yet it did not hold up to my expectations. The biggest disapointmen of all was that she did not find out about Rory. I think that Bartrice small could have done a lot better on this book.
2,A big disapointment,"I always get excited when Ms. Small puts out a new book but this one was far short of what i was expecting. First of all, the story line was weak and not at all in the same spirit of the other O'Mally saga books. I think it would have been interesting if Fortune were to find out that Rory was her father. There were some promising characters toward the end of the book but they were gone within a few pages. Ms. Small should either spice things up or think about retiring the saga."
2,sucks good but messy,"Bought this for a reasonable price and were amazed at how much dirt it picked up that our old vac did not get. The main reason we bought a new vac was for allergy filtration with the new HEPA filters that you can now get in a reasonably priced machine. The problem was, when we had to empty the canister after the first time we cleaned there was so much dust in the air. We had to shake and hit the filter to get the dust off of it, and that created a bigger dust cloud. We were sneezing and coughing for some time. So we took it back the next day.I have never written a review before and felt I needed to warn others of this. I use reviews for my shopping and found this machine hightly rated and bought it. But for allergy sufferers, the bagless and filters you need to clean are terrible. I am looking for a good vac with bags now."
5,Most Excellent Vacuum!,"Just bought this vacuum a few weeks ago.I was replacing a ... bagless vacuum I bought 2 years ago.The ... was loud, heavy and annoying.This Eureka blows the ... away.It's lighter, easier to use, quieter, just as powerful, better looking, and much less expensive. The dust collecting container works better than the Hoover. It's bigger and less of a hassle to empty.(Part of the reason why the Eureka is cheaper than the ...is that it doesnt come with a bare floor attachment and enough extension wands to do proper bare floor vacumming. I purchased the attachments seperately. Now Im all set...)Do not hesitate to buy this vacuum.It's nearly perfect."
4,Good Overall,"These fenders are very solid and pretty easy to install. I had to tinker a bit in order to make them fit just right, but it wasn't that bad. These are the only fenders I have experience with and I would definitely buy them again."
5,Great Fenders for a great Bicycle Surly LHT,I really do like the looks of these fenders on my new Surly LHT Touring Bicycle.Some people don't like the logo on the fenders.But I don't mind it at all its like when you buy a new car they put there logo on your car so what's the different???To me it just lets people know what brand of fenders you are running on your bicycle that's all.To me these look way better than the SKS P65 Fenders I'm not saying the other fenders are not good at all.I just like these fenders way better that's all.
2,Good fenders,"I like these fenders although I have to agree with the other person who responded with the ""Planet Bike""logo on the fenders. It is quite large and realy does detract from the fenders and it can not be removed without repainting over it. Also Amazon did not pack this very well and the tape holding the box shut came open that with the fact that the fenders come in a plastic bag caused me to lose one pice of hardware. PB sent me a new part right away.They install in a snap and can be adjusted to fit very nicely.I recommend them but would also give them higher rating if they did not have any crap Corp. logos on them and packed in a plastic bag."
4,Keeps me Dry!,"These fenders have kept me dry in a couple of rainstorms already and do not hamper my ability to bike at all. The only down side to these fenders are how they attached to the bike. They do not give you enough bolts so you are forced to use the wire ties to attach one of the fenders. Other than that, no complaint about these fenders. I'd recommend these if you need a fender to keep you dry on the way to work or school."
1,THESE ARE PLASTIC NOT ALUMINUM!!!!,this is a really deceiving advertisement.I ordered the PINK FENDERS. . . they are 100% plastic. . NO ALUMINUM here. .they are costly $$$$$And a pain to now return!!!!How can you put this description up of your product that is NOT TRUE?
4,Work great; annoying logo,"I just tested these on my Surly Long Haul trucker with 26x1.5"" tires. They fit perfectly and mount fairly easily. The mud flaps are great. Last weekend I rode 100 miles on the dirt and mud C&O; canal trail. There were many 50-foot long 3"" deep puddles, and these kept me and the bike almost dry with only a little mud on my feet and the bottom bracket.It was great to ride through a long muddy puddle and just watch the water stream out of the fender, instead of covering my water bottles, legs, back, and derailleurs.They have already made themselves worth the purchase, and will be great for commuting.As mentioned by the other reviewer, the Planet Bike logo on the rear fender is huge and cannot be removed. I may cover mine with a strip of reflective tape."
5,Excellent bicycle fender for my old Trek touring bike,"Very useful on rainy days, no more splashes on my back- even protects the lower part of the frame, chain and other components from excess dirt and water. Now that I have it on bike, I wonder why didn't I use it earlier! All of my other bicycles are getting their own.It came with all the necessary hardware and took only about 30 min to install, very easily done!"
1,Disappointed-Not The Right OS in Description,"I love playing Monopoly and I really looked forward to this version. The writeup says this can be used with Win XP/Vista. When I received the actual CD-ROM, it said Win 95/98. No way can I use this with Vista. I had to return it."
5,Love those Calhoun women!!!!,"""Megan's Mate"" was my favorite story in this set. While all of the Calhouns are great..this story was a bit different since Megan wasn't one of the 4 sisters. Great reading....and Kevin was such a little sweetie!"
2,the calhouns/suzanna and megan,I am very unhappy with this book since part of it is missing. Pages between 248 and 273 and not there so the end of the first story is gone and the beginning of the second. Obviously I would like some sort of compensation for this.
4,The Calhouns: Suzanna and Megan,I'm a Nora Roberts fan and this is one I haven't been able to find. I like going to a place that has what I'm looking for and all I have to do is sit at the computer!
4,another Roberts success,"I had read the previous titles in this series, and enjoyed these two sequels. Well written, entertaining, kept my interest."
4,Better then the first..,"Although the stories between Suzanna and Holt, and Megan and Nate were running along the same theme.. I liked the general plot of the book. It was less predicatable then the first book. It was enjoyable and quick. I have only read one other trilogy by Nora Roberts and I liked the Trilogy better(The Garden Series). I will continue to read Nora Roberts and I do recommend The Calhoun Women if your looking for a quick easy-to-read type of novel. Sweet.. touching... overall good."
1,"The Calhouns: Catherine, Amanda and Lilah","I would love to review this product, but I never received it. I tracked the shippment and it said it was damaged. I don't know what happened to it after that. Also the book ""The Calhoun's Suzanna and Megan. I think they were shipped together."
3,CRAZY FUNNY,"I found this movie very,very ,very funny really with the parts of that comic J.WILLIAMS HE IS SOOO Funny that crazy director, a porn director,i did not stoplaughing, he was so good real funny."
1,Worst support in the history of mankind,"This company is unable to support their products.If you need support forget it.I've been dealing with them for over a year (if you can call a one way conversation ""dealing with"").Web support is a laugh.Phone support is non-existent.Basically if you need help you will not get any."
4,replacement brushes,"these brushes are a great replacement, however i bought them and built a boot scraper on my own without the form they usually come with. less expensive and easy to do."
2,Warrant - 'Ultraphobic' (CMC International) 2 1/2 stars,"Better than their 'Live 1886-97' disc(see my review),'Ultraphobia' was their fourth release.Seriously,Warrant never will match the success of their first two CD's.This disc,anyway seems to be a bit bluesy and even a pinch heavier than their three prior offerings.Tunes that may take one by surprise are ""Crawl Space"",""Undertow"",""Family Pinic"" and maybe ""Stronger Now"".If you liked Warrant's first two lp's,you should get something from this CD.Give it a listen."
1,Skip it,"Muddy music, boringly simplistic lyrics and an emotional level that brings to mind something recorded at gunpoint: this is Ultraphobic. Not even close to the level of Warrant's previous efforts; this album makes even DRFSR more attractive. Basically a transparent, and badly done, attempt to curry radio favor."
1,Absolutely horrible,"Sometimes it's a good thing when old school bands try to change their signature sounds. I thought Slang from Def Leppard and Generation Swine from Motley Crue were great albums. However, the reason that those albums were so great was because the bands were experimenting with new sounds as musicians. The change in Warrant's sound in this case was simply an 80's hair band trying to change with the times and fit into a musical genre that they really didn't want to be in. To put it bluntly, they failed miserably. It's about the same failure with the grunge sound that Motley Crue had with their self titled album with John Corabi. If you are a fan of Warrant's hair band days, odds are that you will really dislike this attempt at fitting in with the 90's trends in music."
1,Seller cancelled order without contacting me!,"I ordered this to protect my pda screen and the seller simply cancelled the order without contacting me. The reason was my address does not show up in whatever database they use, so they just cancelled the order.I live in the middle of the national forrest and few addresses here show up on mapping software! Another seller had the same problem, but took the time to email me to confirm my address. I received my purchase, he received his payment and everyone was happy.I wish this seller had bothered to do the same."
4,Vintage Harlem club jazz,"The majority of the selections on COTTON CLUB DAYS date back to the pre-big band era of the late 1920s and early '30s. Those were the glory times of that famous Harlem nightspot, when orchestras fronted by Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Don Redman (conspicuously absent from this set), and others performed there regularly for an almost totally white audience.The tracks on this collection have been dubbed from LPs, rather than the original 78s. This in itself isn't a detriment, however the records have echo added, and a few also have some obvious groove distortion. The album's liner notes give running times and personnel for all songs; recording dates are included for most, as well.Despite the less than perfect source material, COTTON CLUB DAYS is still an interesting mix of 16 songs that celebrate one of the best-ever venues for fine jazz music."
4,"Very good album, whole-heartedly recommend buying.","These guys are the ultimate bass rappers. They are great in the sense that their music is full of energy and great to dance to. The lyrics aren't full of swearing and the album itself contains a great single Woof Woof, which is also part of the Dr. Dolittle soundtrack.These guys deserve a lot of respect for their rapping ability. I recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys dancing and/or listens to multiple kinds of rap, particularly bass rap."
5,book review,loved this book from start to finishthe characters were great andthe storyline was good and strongfrom the beginningwill read more of her books
4,As good as Dead by Beverly Barton,I really like the series that she puts out in her books. they are all so far been the very best. I enjoy them greatly
3,Ok,"The book was an easy read but I was disappointed that the relationship between Reve and Jacob was not more developed. There were glimpses into the development but it wasn't until the last couple of book that they got together and that was to have sex. I felt that the book was once again about Jazzy, Reve's sister, whom we had read about in ""The Last to Die""."
3,Downhill,"This is the third story of a trilogy set in Cherokee County, TN. Each involve a set of lovers and a serial killer. Three serial killers in one small county is a bit much, but okay if the stories are good. The first book was good enought to stir interest for the second, which was not quite as good. The third is the worst. All the books feature unhappy marriages between older couples although they are not the main story. Actually, they may be as by the third book, there seems to be more of them written about than the young couples. It almost makes you want to run fast from the opposite sex if things are going to turn out like this. All that misery becomes too much over time, with the love scenes, not quite enough to make up for the rest.Barton is a good writer. I just hope she gets writes other themes with a little more joy in them."
5,Aunt Ellen's Tatting Handbook,This is a very good beginning tatter's handbook. It includes good diagrams and instructions and an excellent variety of patterns - everything from small motifs to collars.
2,Not as new as it says it was.,"I was very disappointed in the appearance, it had stickers and things marked out and supposedly this was a new book that had not been used. It was yellowed, more than what the picture shows. Not worth the price I paid for it."
2,depressing movie,This movie was weird and depressing. Not entertaining at all. Would not have wasted my money buying this movie.
3,A Modern Version Of Romeo And Juliet,"A great Romeo and Juliet story, but I don't know why there's no kissing scene between Aaliyah and Jet. It doesn't make sense. Shouldn't you kiss your love interest? Anyway, I loved the father-daughter theme 'cause it reminded me of the relationship I have with my dad, but he wasn't shady. Romeo Must Die is a great film...except the snakes made me very uncomfortable and scared. So I looked away in some scenes. I still can't understand Aaliyah's fascination with them, but different strokes for different folks. One more thing, the landscape was very beautiful and the soundtrack was great. Overall, great actors and great acting so I recommend it. Without a kiss, I will not give this movie 5 stars. And because of the snakes they showed, I'll remove one more star."
5,Prelude to Glory series of books,"I read the first three volums of this series, and they were spell binding. After reading each of these books, I shared them with my friends, who also couldn't put them down. I am now hoping that there will be a vol. 4. For any one who wants to learn about for formation of our country, these books are a must. I highly recomend them for any one who is a member of the Daughters of the American Revelution. Understanding just what it took for gain the freedom of the United States, will give you a better appreciation of what it took to make our country free."
5,Prelude to Glory Series - All three books,"My husband and I are in our 60's and it has been a long time since we studied American history. Neither one of us understood or remembered many things about the American Revolution that we studied years ago. These books have brought us a better understanding of the American Revolution. We highly recommend it especially for high school age youth. History will come alive for them. We have always appreciated our forefathers, but never to the extent we do now after reading these books. We can't wait for the next one!"
5,Oklahoma Notes Neurology,"This book was a great help for my review for the usmle step 2. It is an easy to read book , not so long and above all not boring at all. On the contrary it was very enjoyable. I would greatly recommend this book."
3,Good but..,"A good read, but why does Professor Ehteshami, on the Durham University website, claim that this is an authored book, when in actual fact it is an edited book? This rides roughshod over the efforts of the actual contributors."
2,"Interesting as anthropology, but skippable as a novel.","Only the truly hard core Block fans will need to read Cinderella Sims. Written during his pulp ... novel writing days, Cinderella Sims includes the requisite one [physical] scene per chapter embedded in a con-gone-wrong, crime story. There's some clever plotting and some better-than-average writing, considering the none-too-distinguished venue, but this is one you'll want to check out at the library, ..."
5,Abba,"Very nice.....I attended the concert in 1979 in San Diego, and the disc is very representative of that famous tour."
1,Don't do it,Big disappointment......no concert format....broke up...incomplete ( I have a dream)no good hits...alot missing. definitely 1 star.GO FOR THE GOLD HITS. DVD. DON O.
4,ABBA (Another DVD for collectors!!!),"Hi this time is for presents the new DVD for ABBA, i lock the VHS version the video is poor in this DVD version the audio and video is great, the bonus videos is the special from this ithem Thank you For The Music clip is great. In Essential this DVD is good im expected is the released ABBA-The Movie Next Year?."
2,Too much rockumentary hero worship for me,"I like Abba and wanted a DVD of their concert for '79, a show which I saw back then. There are good moments but my biggest complaint is there is too much documentary about how great they are, how Take a Chance on Me came to them, but my biggest complaint, the track ""I Had a Dream"" which was the best song of the show is butchered with a documentatary halfway through the song. To see ""I HAd a Dream"" uncut, you had to go to the extras. Why wasn't it the other way around? Maybe there is another Abba DVD out there which just plays the show and goes light on the documentary."
4,Still Hungry,"ABBA was great during their concert scenes, but we get too much of useless footage. Since there is so little footage of ABBA in concert, I was hoping this would give me my fill. I didn't care to see roller skaters, roadies, or kids practicing or singing ABBA songs. I wanted to see ABBA. While on stage, they have 4 individual shows going on, and they are great. They shine the light on the whole band, at times, and that's enjoyable. When they performed, ""Dancing Queen"", I thought the clapping wouldn't end, but they followed it with ""Does Your Mother Know"", and that particular version, blew me away, and it seemed to have the same effect on the audience. The printout that comes with the DVD, is mostly about the creator of this compilation, patting himself on the back, which did not impress me. I was left hungry for more ABBA concert footage. The camera close-ups were usually too close. Agnetha and Frida look great, and performed great."
4,Brings back memories and is good for the price.,"I saw ABBA during this tour in Seattle. Wow did this bring back some memories!My freinds and I in high school were all into Led Zeppelin and the like, and if any of us owned an ABBA record we sure didn't tell anyone, so it was sure funny how myself and my friends jumped at the chance to see them in concert. That was probably the best rock concert I've ever been to, and I sure don't see anything coming in the future to beat 'em.I really wish this had had more concert footage and less other stuff, but that's the way it goes. Still, great for the price especially if you're an ABBA fan and you remember seeing them in concert."
4,Great Concert Dragged Down By A Decent Rockumentary,"I love ABBA. I have all their dvds available. I brought ""ABBA In Concert"" last Christmas but haven't found the time to review it until this morning. What can I tell you about this 25 year old tape? Well, let me just say that the perfromances are nothing short of excellent. The remastering job is superb, both visually as well as audio. You feel, for the mos part, like you're at the concert. However, there's one porblem: too much documentary, not enough concert. I was hoping we'd get a full concert rather than a few complete performances and a ton of documentary footage. So while I do recommend this dvd, keep in mind it isn't a complete concert dvd."
2,ABBA DVD,The sound quality wasn't as good as it should have been. Not enough of their concerts. Too much filler.
2,Bah!,"I'm really dissapointed with this production. I've got other ABBA DVDs as ""The Winner Takes It All"" and ""The Definitive Collection"" because ABBA is one of the greatest music groups of all history.I'm not sure if they aggred with this DVD producers, or maybe ABBA members never saw the final product. First of all, the sound quality is really, really poor. You can compare The ABBA Definitive Collection, and that's something better. That has been good performed, seriously. I think producers -knowing ABBA fans' anxiety of having their music or concerts- have launch this DVD to earn all the money they can.I hope to get another version, more serious. The essence of the productios is really valuable, but customers cannot satisfy this people ambition.I demand more responsability from producers, and more respect to this outstanding group!"
2,BUY THE VIDEO COLLECTION DVD INSTEAD,Very disappointing DVD. I much prefer the Video collection DVD.
1,Very disappointed in this DVD,"In a nutshell - A lot of useless, boring ""FILLER"" and verylittle ""CONCERT"". Only diehard ABBA fans should purchasethis DVD; those fans who can't get enough of ABBA in any way,shape or form. Those who want to sit back and enjoy a""concert"" on DVD should shy away from this piece of work."
2,Not Enough Music,"This is probably great for the ABBA fan who wants to learn about the group, but if you are wanting a video of them doing what they do best, you will probably be disappointed. The DVD includes too much stuff that is not ABBA performing. The bits and pieces of their performances that are included are good, but I had hoped for more of a ""concert"" DVD as the title suggests."
5,Great DVD,"I wanted to see this old concert with tons of hit songs on it, so I bought this for my DVD collection to enjoy over and over again in the future."
1,Disappointing,"The sound and video quality are terrible.I love ABBA,but this DVD jsut is not too good.It would be great to see live or maybe if they had put it together better,Basically this is only gonna be a good one for die hard fans."
4,Intersting Conference Discussion of Falling Away,"This is recount of a 1987 conference on the topic of apostasy in America. What this book demonstrates is that they concluded that apostasy definitely is a problem, yet they could not define what is was, thus it's significance is great.What then controls the spotlight is talking about different gospels causing people to fall away from the true gospel. But yet, little real discussion about what the true gospel is, and much about political matters and how the church should be or not be involved in such.There is some provocative inklings of discussion about what I sense of apostasy in America, but this book doesn't not provide much to go on. Possibly one of the commenters had it right: could it be that we all engaged in higher education don't know it because we're not around it?"
3,"Nice sign, edges look a little rustier than expected","It is supposed to have an authentic rusted look to it. After getting it, the edges were a little rustier than expected. I'm thinking now that it would actually look better as a newer non-rusted looking sign. However, I did not find this as an option.Overall the sign was nice and like the wording. It was a side gift for someone with a man cave. It is a nice size and was affordably priced. It is a nice side gift, but would take the non-rusted sign if it was an option."
2,Not the best,"Delivered not in the best condition, has a lot of rust, which I tried to clean and couldn't really. I kept it because I hate the hassle of returning things. Looks like it was stored in the wrong place."
2,its ok,its an ok slasher movie. its a bit confusing and the screen is kinda dark. u really cant see to much of the killings just more of a hint from the dark screen
2,Great head mechanism but watch out for loose parts,"This head is extremely solid, yet very easy to use. Thanks to the hydrostatic mechanism, in most cases you only need to move one knob to adjust camera position. The only downside is that the quick release lever is fixed to the head by a screw that needs to be tightened constantly to avoid the lever from dropping (together with your camera)."
1,How did this happen?,"This is, without doubt, the absolute WORST Judas Priest album ever. It saddens me so deeply that the band who defined heavy metal is now trying so hard to sound like everyone else. This album is missing every single element that made Judas Priest good to begin with. The guitar work is awful, the beats are overblown, and the vocals...what were they thinking? How many times could they possibly use the ""deep voice"" effect instead of the great harmonies Halford used to provide. If your looking for a good laugh, this is your CD. If you want great metal, buy anything else Priest has ever done."
1,Very un-Priest,"If you like the 70's and 80's Priest as I do, then you'll likely be very disappointed as I was - this disc really sucks something fierce. Nevermind Rob Halford (whom I loved), the masterful guitarwork of Downing and Tipton has been replaced by the less skillful chugga-chugga sound of 90's metal. On a 1 to 5 scale, it's really a zero. Pick up virtually anything from the Halford era and you'll likely be pleased."
1,dissapointed,"the worst of judas priest. the singer lacks everything including his own personality.the 5star reviews must be from teenagers that never grasped the true talent of judas priest. the intro to every song is draw out but the rifs are quit good to say the most. they will never be judas priest again untill halford comes back.the music would be a little better if they dumped the punk ""ripper""(please) owens."
1,"Mighty Priest, where hast thou gone?","I waited seemingly forever for this album after I had read the news that Priest was coming back. Unforunately, Jugulator left me unsatisfied and even numb - a serious letdown. This is not true JP, but a total re-casting of our Metal Gods. Ironically, Ripper Owens can nail Halford's melodies, shrieks, and wails; but the double attack of Glenn & K.K. has become a forgettable, speed-metal travesty bereft of rhythm (even beyond Halford's latest work).I have endured this album only a single time. Alas, it now collects dust. I can only await their next attempt and hope that Priest return to their hard-driving yet rhythmic roots (Sad Wings, Point of Entry, British Steel, et al).To get a truer Priest fix, I reco Glenn Tipton's recent ""Baptizm of Fire""."
1,"a JP disciple asks:""Oh mighty Priest, where hast thou gone?""","I waited seemingly forever for this album after I had read the news that Priest was coming back.

2,Don't even bother buying and I love Judas Priest,"First of all, JP is one of my very favorite bands and I have all of their cds and tribute cds. I even love the 3 tribute cds despite some bad reviews some of them got. I went back and recently picked up Demolition and Jugulator just to complete my collection and believe me, the collection was complete without these. They both suck. And, I really wanted to like them and have listened to them several times trying to like them. Not at all JP like. These are very amateurish songs and not worth your purchase. Ripper can sing. Too bad he didn't get the chance the way these songs are written so this is not a crack on him."
2,What??????????,"Okay, I am a fan of Judas Priest....that's why it pains me to do this. Apologies to all the Priest fans out there but I have to give this CD 2 stars....as another person mentioned in their review, this album does have its moments and I myself gave it a chance....I played it once then had to listen to it again. However, final verdict for me is 2 stars......this is just mediocre. The Judas Priest I know is the 'You've Got Another Thing Comin'' from the CD ""Screaming For Vengeance"" and 'Some Heads Are Gonna Roll', 'Jawbreaker' from the CD ""Defenders Of The Faith"". I don't know what to call this group here but it's not Judas Priest"
2,"THIS AIN'T JUDAS, I'M SORRY","Nothing against Ripper Owens. He's an amazing singer ( I'm not comparing him with Halford, I'm only making an evaluation of his own capabilities ). But, except for the song ""CATHEDRAL SPIRES"", the album is so weak I could hardly believe it is Judas Priest. They tried to sound a little more ""heavier"" and ""dark"", maybe tried to copy PANTERA or something like that, I don't know !!! I hope they improve."
5,BRUTAL,"I could not belive my ears the first time I heard this CD. I was expecting something heavy but this surpassed my expectations. All metal fans should have this one but those Priest fans in particular. Good work boys, you did it again!"
5,Seperates the men from the boys,"The Men: ""Jugulator rattled my freakin' cage. Heavy, brutal and Ripper has more than a pathetic nasal whine to show."" The Boys: ""Yikes, too heavy!When's the next Dokken Reunion?"""
1,Save your money for true Priest recordings,"Priest is not dead, it's just disappointing to listen to this album. Here one can see how important Halford's work was. On this album too many songs are just fillers. One good song: cathedral spires. But on the whole, not worth the money."
1,Not the same,"The album is nothing but [garbage]. I can't believe that Judas Priest decided to become a thrash metal band. Tim Owens tries to sound like Halford, but it's obvious that it isn't the same singer. The song titles are death inspired, (Dead Meat, Decapitate,), and the music terrible, sounding more like Slayer. This is NOT Judas Priest, and I strongly discourage any Priest fan from buying this CD."
2,Don't buy this one if you expect it to sound like Priest....,"I completely agree with Mark Egebrecht! I was surprised when I listened to this! THIS doesn't even sound like Judas Priest at all. Their awesome style of music has COMPLETELY changed on this one! Don't get me wrong, its metal, but NOT J.P.! Thrash is more like it, if you like that.Sure miss Halford. INSTEAD, buy Halford's Ressurection. SO MUCH BETTER...EVERY SONG IS FANTASTIC!"
3,NOT THEIR BEST,"There's a few good songs on this cd BURN IN HELL, BULLET TRAIN and the 11 minute epic CATHEDRAL SPIRES, which is a true Priest classic, but Glenn Tipton's lyrics are often pretty stupid (the title track, DEAD MEAT, DEATH ROW). Their heaviest album to date, it won't sit well with old school Priest fans but it's not a total loss. The songs are just crafted for Ripper to scream and snarl, although he actually sings at times. The cover art looks like a B grade comic book, or a rejected version of the DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH cover. Anyhoo, it's okay. Some great songs, some good songs, some bad songs...."
1,Tim 'Rip-off' Owens,"Whoa. Leather, spikes and whips are the theme of every songs. It's like theyre discovering the homosexuality within themselves. The lyrics are at the worst point. This is not Judas Priest."
5,Take This ..,"For all those who said Priest was over and done, here's to you!! Simply Brutal.. Priest proved once again that it dominates metal music; No matter the style."
4,"The ""Priest"" is back!!","I bought this album the day it came out. It's a very heavy and very dark album. Tim is a great singer...a good replacement for Halford. But I do disagree with the other reviewer. When he said Owens does Halford better than Halford. Thats is wrong. Halford is a better singer than Owens. Back to the album. I love this album all the way around...the only thing I dont like is the long intros on every song. I totally recommend anyone who's a Priest freak to buy it.Keep the Faith,Dana"
3,"Good music, bad lyrics","The music kicks[butt], but the lyrics just [are bad] at some parts. With that being said...Ripper does a good job of filling Halford's shoes and Cathedral Spires is one of the best songs Priest has ever written. If you can find it on [website] or [website]for [money amount]I would suggest gettting it."
2,Priest went Grunge...,This album was disappointing. Definitely not the Priest I love to hear. Almost all songs tuned down to D and grunged out. Singer sounds like Ronnie James Dio meets all the other grunge wannabes out there with a little bit of Rob. The great Priest double solos are missing. What a mess. This is a waste of plastic.
2,WHAT IS the name of this band? Judas Priest?,"THis is another band, another completely different project, another logo, another singer, stupid lyrics by Tipton, new record company. So, it should have another name...Why Priest tries so hard to sound like just another average nineties metal-band??? Why????"
5,One of the best metal discs I've ever heard!!!!!!!!,"I used to hate Judas Priest - until I bought Jugulator. It took em' twenty years but Priest finally rock!! ""Ripper"" kicks ass man!! The guitars rule and the drums get me hard baby!! I don't believe how good this album is compared to the old stuff - which sounds so weak... THIS is METAL!! Songs like Blood Stained , Burn in Hell (one of the best metal songs I've ever heard!) and Catherdral Spires will send you slamdancing in a moshpit or in your own bedroom!! Buy it - TRUST ME!!! Priest Rules!!!"
5,"Goalllllllllllllllll, they scored big time!!!","Judas is back and there better than every. Tim owens is great, not as good, but good. The album is a great cd, its one of the best ever. Even though the solos are smaller, there still good. No priest for 7 years is hell!!!! They came back roaring through the gates of hell, and they did it well, buy the album, support and Defend the Faith!!!!!!! ROCK ON!!!!!"
5,brutal priest!!!!,"The first album to showcase x-winter's bane vocalist Tim ""ripper"" Owens on vocals and he completely rips on this album its not just a name he kills, live he's even better. not saying I don't like halford, on the contrary I prefer Halford with Priest it just seems more natural with him in the fold. But Jugulator stands alone as the heaviest album of their career, and corney lyrics or not the tracks stick in your head, and the riffs and solos are awesome! to everyone that thought Priest would sell out on this record they came out and kicked the piss out of you. If you like your music heavy as hell, with a vocalist with more range then most anyone except the metal god himself than buy this album, just give it time it will eat you alive."
2,Someone Tell Me What Happened,"Wow-what a difference a few years and a new singer make. This is probably the most brutal Priest album ever. Not that that is bad but the one thing that ruins this album are the lyrics. Glenn Tipton is no Rob Halford when it comes to lyrics, and good lyrics go hand in hand with Priest songs. The music is average-sounds like the guys have been listenening to Slayer or Testament a bit too much. Ripper has a great voice, close to Halford's but obviously younger. Ian Hill and Scott Travis rumble on as usual. The best cuts from this album are ""Death Row"", ""Cathedral Spires"" and ""Burn in Hell"". All the material here is tight and well played but is a bit boring. Do yourself a favor and get ""Priest Live '98"". It really showcases Ripper's voice and is awesome. Pass this one up."
4,Priest revitalized,"With Riper Owens addition Priest has recover youth from their past they sound powerfull, very powerfull and with more energy that many new bands, also this is one of that very few times when change of frontman gets credit in a band before fans, really this change worked out and this is very rare to happen, not only this new vocalist has been accepted but, this band has now the admiration of new fans like me , before ""Jugulator"" i never really get into Priest music so much but this time they were like a whole new band for me and im pretty sure that the same thing happened to many metal followers that never before were Priest fans , however is good that Halford is back nothing better than classic Priest but this band can be proud of Owens and Owens can be proud of himself , he really filled Halford shoes and that is not easy.HM"
4,Only classic album with bad lyrics,"I've never been a big priest fan myself i always considered there stuff to be umm ""corny""...i was always into the darker classic music like Maiden and sabbath i guess. This album though really took me to a new level,not because of being judas priest but because Rippers intensity was far superior to anything i had heard(although halford is great).Being a fan of heavier metal,carcass,soilwork,at the gates etc.this definately suited my fancy.The only area lacking is the evedent cheesy lyrics,but its all made up for with Rippers voice and the killer music,and also Scott Travis's machine like drumming.So i was actually suprised i love this album considering i was never into the Lets Stand Up for Metal type of music,this takes it a step further from the old days."
3,What's with the lyrics?,"Jugulator is the first post-Halford studio effort. They have taken a heavier turn from their earlier years. The songs have lost some of the former musicality of Priest. I kind of like the mood changes with some of the haunting slower parts turning into full thrash. But, like on Demolition, the lyrics are silly (Death Row and Decapitate are just embarassing). The Jugulator lyrics come out worse than Demolition lyrics because they are meant to be much more menacing. Slayer gets away with making similar themes truly frightening because they seem to have more literary skill. I wish Priest would hire somebody to write their lyrics for them (or get Rob Halford back). Their newer releases would then earn a better review. If you are a curious fan of older Judas Priest, get Demolition instead of Jugulator."
2,Not so good...,"""Cathedral Spires"" is one of the greatest metal songs ever written!!! IT's amazing! Ripper sings very well, also. But the albun is not good overall, because it seems that Tipton made it alone, the other musicians only playing half-heartedly."
4,Need to think in a different way.,"I not gonna bash Tim Owens because he is not a bad singer, that being said this is not a great Judas Priest record, however lets not think of it as such. If you think of this as a thrash or industrial metal album, it is actually not that bad and a few of the songs are very very good. Bullet Train and Cathedral Spires are the best songs on the album. So if you are thinking of buying this album dont think of it as a priest album, but think of it as a good thrash album."
3,I work for Ripper Owens at The Ripper Owens Taphouse!!!,Since I work for ripper owens at the ripper owens tap house in akron ohio I had him sign the cd it is awesome!
2,jugulator,"This CD and the one that follows are the 2 worst pieces in the Priest catalogue. Priest is not Priest without Halford. Period. It's too forced of an effort to try and update the sound of the band. It's an attempt at trying to sound like the newer ""90's metal"". You can definitly see how much of an influence Rob had on the band when he came back for Angel of Retribution. Let's just forget that Jugulator and Demolition ever happend."
3,Disapointing performance,"I really found this album very good... but unfortunately, it has Judas Priest's label on the front.It's kind of hard for Ripper to have a debut like this... Anyway, Halford is gone and he had a large pair of boots to fill... and this is not a good beginning...Lack of good lyrics... and so noisy riffs (Death ROw is a song that seemed to be written by a college boy... Abductors is boring and Decapitation... well, I don't like it)The lyrics are awful in some cases... if not in all... Only Bullet Train is worthy to listen... A powerful song with a voice like Ripper's deserves attention...BUt OK, It's the first step... hope they can do it betterGlenn can do it!!!!"
2,"Ah, what a disappointment","I bought this cd with a completely open mind. Ripper Owens is actually a very good singer, and the reason this album sucks so much is not because of him, it's because, well, the cd just sucks! I even like hardcore metal like this, when it's done well. But the fact is, this cd would not come close to comparing to other artists of this genre. Cathredral Spires, like everyone says, is a great song, hence the two stars. other than that, even if you are a death metal fan, try and avoid this one."
4,These aging guys are still dangerous!,"I got this CD only because I was curious how JP sounded without Rob. I was surprised and impressed with the faster, heavier, angrier songs offered by the new JP. It may be because I am a big fan of the heavy stuff like Slayer, Kreator, Grip, Inc...Tim Owen did a very good job. He derserves to get more credits on the success of this CD. I know that some old JP fan don't like this Cd because the new approach. Hey guys, we are living in the 90's. We should listen to this CD without prejudice. Outstanding tracks are Blood Stained, Deathrow, Burn in Hell, Bullet Train. The rest are...good!"
3,great music but trying too hard to be tough,"I loved the music and singing on this album, but, Priest was trying too hard to be tough and ""metal"" (note: not 'heavy metal'). they deal with themes such as death penalty and such, but ""real"" Priest deals with partying, riding motorcycles, and ""heavy metal""."
2,NO BIG DEAL,"The band produced a solid effort, but htis is not Judas Priest. They should have changed their name ... This has nothing to do with Ripper being in the band. It just does nto sound as Judas."
1,What Ever Happend To This Powerful Rock Group?,"This release is a travisity to the name of JUDAS PRIEST. It`s nothing more than noise without any real meaning or any understanding at all. This band was one of the best hard rockers from the eighties but that`s all changed with this harsh rather unispired effert. Rob Halford`s schreching vocals is sadly missed. This new lead singer is nowhere near the form of Halford`s style. `DEAD MEAT` one of the tracks from this release the lyrics you can`t even understand and with the pounding bass and drums, there`s just no enjoyment in their music anymore. If JUDAS PRIEST continues to go on with this they would just fade away to nothing."
4,Heavy!,"I like this new dimension of Priest. Although not in the level of Painkiller or Defenders, it is better than Ram it Down, Turbo or Point Of Entry. Jugulator is the heaviest album (Demolition cannot compare). The best songs are amazing: Bullet Train, Abductors (great screaming), Burn in Hell, and Cathedral Spires(most original and should be a classic). The rest of the songs I don't like much and I just listened to them one time."
3,Pretty good.,"I liked this one quite a bit the 2nd or 3rd time I listened to it but after repeated listens (~15) I realized that I only like 3-4 songs on it and the rest seem like filler. Painkiller is a more consistent album. When I listen to PK I can easily listen to the whole thing.Jugulator isn't that good, it has some songs that are kind of [bad]. The good songs (like the last one, Cathedral Spires?) are really kick ... Overall if you like Painkiller I recommend buying Jugulator because it is quite listenable, it just isn't the best ever."
3,Average,"Though it has it's moments(Burn In Hell, title track, Cathedral Spires), Jugulator as a whole is disappointing. There is way too much filler that sounds juvenile and just plain stupid. Ripper is o.k., but he is no Rob Halford and didn't even really contribute except for the actual singing. Like I said, it has it's moments, but I think Priest needs to hang up the leather jackets once and for all. They're has-beens."
5,Rob who?,"I got this disk and thought it rocked. I saw a concert on the tour for this album and the entire crowd was skeptical of the new singer. That lasted for one song. Everyone had a great time and my friends and I all agreed that Ripper definitely rocks. I didn't miss Rob, and I don't know anyone who did. Ripper rocks, Rob rots, and Jugulator kicks butt. So buy this."
5,A SLAM DUNK,"this cd is a slam dunk. a two hand slam dunk. after a long absence, priest came back kicking ass. jugulator rules.. end of story."
1,Jugulator,"THE absolute worst album Judas Priest ever made. I have been a fan since Stained Class and every album has been different, but excellent. I could not even listen to this entire album it was so bad. Nothing but over done distortion and I'm sorry, I just can't be a Ripper fan. Will be a Halford fan forever. This band will never be the same without Rob."
1,JUNKulator!,what can i say? the previous album (painkiller) was one of the best ever & this is one of the worst albums!
2,I'd give it a C,"Judas Priest-without a doubt metal classics. This album doesn't live up to the bands back catalog. Here's why: 1. Lyrics are stupid Decapitate? Jugulate? Death Row? come on these lyrics are frikin terrible.2. No melody what truly makes a memorable song is it's hook. Melody can be one of the heaviest elements on a good metal record. (no memorable melodies)3. Guitars detuned In order to accomidate the lower range of ripper Owens, the guitars are tuned a full step and a half down. The result is it sounds like Cannible Corpses or other mindless death metal"
1,THis is NOT Judas Priest give ME a minus star!,"Ive been a fan for 20years, since the British steele album debuted, this is not Judas Priest. Every one can say, its awesome, its great but you know damn well it sucks. The chords are no better then a garage band and after the superb album Tipton put out on his own he should be ashamed of himself. Ripper is nothing great and his voice in the song(s) just prove he cannot create good vocals on his own. LIVE he is excellent. Please people take it from a guy who has followed Judas Priest for 20 or more years. This is not the Priest I remember, and its one I want to forget!!!! THe worst album ever put out by Priest. End of story and stop with ""its the BEST"" because that proves you DO NOT UNDERSTAND the band called Judas Priest. Your just on the band wagon."
1,Riding the Coat tails,"This is all they are doing people. They are riding the coat tails of there legend. This new music may be good for the NEW comers, but for true, real Priest fans that have loved them for so long, this is by far there most miserable failure ever. I cannot remember them putting out a album so bad. There best album ever was Screaming for Vengeance, it was a true cutting edge sound, now its over sampled, poor chorded and copied halford vocals... Sorry people, if you like it great, but if your a true fan, Judas Priest died with Pain Killer. That was there last album, this is just garbage to get money."
4,"ripper proves he is the updated,perfected rob....","this is a great addition to the hundreds of killer recordings,it is fresh an has a vocalist who takes you one on one....ya love him or you like him alot.rob's voice has lost too much to compete with a younger harder rocking substitute......buy this and then the live in london dvd,and you too will be a believer......"
1,What a rip,This is Two pieces of Styrofoam that you glue together and then apply to your attic floor with some magnet tape. I really hated that I paid so much for it. It cost $60 to return so that's not an option. I'm going to use but I wish I had never ordered it.
4,Listen Without Prejudice,"I have heard several performances of 'Songfest' and have to conclude that this isn't the best, so it is a great pity that a superior version isn't available. Contrary to the other reviewers, I do not believe that Bernstein was going off the boil when he wrote 'Songfest'. It is a masterly work,which pays homage to the different voices of America, past and present. The music is written in a very approachable tonal idiom, with the exception of the brilliant second movement, in which Bernstein has written a superb twelve-note jazz tune. 'Songfest' is a passionate, deeply moving work, which deserves to be more popular. Its time will come."
5,Sum of all fears,"Very good condition. This is a great soundtrack, if you like suspenseful music this is it. I would highly recommend it and the retailer as well."
1,order review,this was listed as an audio book. It's not. It's a soundtrack to the movie. I tried to contact amazon but nobody got back to me..if I could do zero stars I would.
3,good but the ordering was kind of off,"this cd had great pieces but some of the pieces where out of place such as ""If We Can Get Through This"" but overall it is a good cd"
5,Great earrings,"This is a great pair of earrings and they are very comfortable! They are strong enough for you to wear them all the time, yet light enough that they are not weghing down your ear!"
5,Measurement Theory for Engineers: Review.,"This book is devoted to industrial applications of Statistical Measurement Theory. The book deals with general problems of measurements and not with the technical aspects of measuring specific physical quantities.Each chapter is followed by exercises, most with solutions and answers. The text assumes that the reader is familiar with standard courses of Calculus, Probability Theory and Statistics.I have used the text of Prof. Gertsbakh for a part of undergraduate course ""StatisticalQuality Control"" and students' graduation projects in Negev Academic College of Engineering (Beer-Sheva, Israel), and I am really pleased with the book, its contents and style.Unfortunately, it seems to be a technical mistake in the text, on the page 62: the formula (4.2.1) is deleted, and it must read Xij=ì+Ai+ij.Dr. Ilia B. FrenkelIndustrial Engineering and Management DepartmentNegev Academic College of Engineering (NACE)Beer Sheva, Israel"
5,"One of The Best ""Pioneer"" Gay Products!","I'm old enough to remember when this film ""came out! "" Craig Russell was a wonderully bright entertainer, who had that certain edge. For historic rites of passage alone, people should buy a copy of this video. Long before ""Torch Song"" and/or ""Priscilla,"" we had Craig and ""Outrageous"" to get us through the drab days of being gay in this country!What I want to know is this; Whatever happened to the sequel, ""Too Outrageous? "" Why not put both on video and sell it as a boxed set? Now, that WOULD be outrageous, wouldn't it?Enjoy!"
5,At last it's on VHS! How 'bout DVD?,"One saw this film on TV back in the seventies, not long after it ""came out"" in theatres, and was stunned by the principal's excellence at his craft. Only tonight did one learn that Keith Russell has since died of AIDS, circa 1990? (OUTRAGEOUS had made its sequel in 1987). Perhaps it may be ""a word to the wise:"" WATCH OUT!"
1,"OUTRAGEOUSly bad technical quality, FABULOUS movie","I still remember seeing this film in Toronto when it came out in 1977. I was looking forward to seeing it again....but as another reviewer here has written....the transfer to video has been done so carelessly. It's dark, sometimes the characters heads are cut off, and near the end the sound doesn't sync with the actor's mouths! I can't believe a video company would want to sell a product so shabbily put together.BUT it's a charming moving film from the early days of gay cinema...and no one can beat Craig's brilliance."
5,"""Kentucky Meets Academe""","What an engrossing read! And one of the reasons is the juxtaposition between the authentic Kentucky cast of characters & dialect & syntax and the superior, compact writing which makes generous use of 25-cent words (not 50-cent, mind you).I will watch for future offerings from Mr. Kelsay, in hopes that they will be equally genuine but, like this one, slightly fantastical!"
1,"Oh, Please!","Are you Ejucaided Redneck in disguise? This was yet another attempt to make money by continuing to stereotype eastern Kentuckians. *I* live in Winchester, and most of the people I know are nowhere near as provincial as the ones in this book. Also, the stereotype doesn't even stay true to form! One minute some good ol' boy is chawin' and spittin', while talking like a bad Jed Clampett makeover, and the next he is serving home-made gourmet food to his lady-love.Better luck next time, Mr. Kelsay. Try writing about something you KNOW."
3,A Poor Selection of Cards,I love Nick Bantock's work. The endless nuances of his altered artwork continues to amaze me. But I feel this collections of notecards are certainly NOT the most interesting that could have been reproduced. I doubt I'll use many of these.
3,Nice and Weird,Shoes were comfortable yet weird to walk on because I'm not used to wearing a one inch heel. Must admit that the shoes look nicer on the picture than in real life.
2,NEVER AGAIN!,"I have worn this model shoe for years, and will wear nothing else. Unfortunately, the vendor Heart and Sole sent me a pair with BOTH insteps heavily creased as though they had been worn. They looked like shoes look AFTER they are broken in. Usually on NEW shoes, the insteps are VERY smooth and look new. After wearing them for awhile, yes, they will crease. The soles of these shoes were unmarked, yet I am suspicious that these were already worn on carpet before being sold to me. I am VERY familiar with the Duke boot, therefore I believe it is not my imagination at work here. Disappointed to say the least. Upon further inspection, I also noticed what appear to be dark ink-like marks on the front of BOTH shoes,and scuff marks on BOTH shoes,between the heels and the soles. I apologize for being so caustic, but this is exactly what took place. To pre-empt the question of why I didn't return them; they were needed for the holidays."
5,Good stuff !,This film has an element of coolness that I like. The aboriginal being the coolest one of all- does his thing with elegance.
5,brilliant portrail of the early settlement of australia,"I have read many books on the settlement of australia and the history is well presented in this movie,I wish we had more of them."
5,Clash in Australia: Aborigine and White,It's impossible not to be a David Gulpilil fan...he can do no wrong in any film. He exudes an aboriginal dignity in the same way that Toshire Mifune exudes a samurai dignity. This is a film about his assignment as a tracker hired to find an Aborigine criminal. The film examines who is the criminal and who is the innocent...who has standing in the bush wilderness and who does not. A very interesting film and well worth purchasing.
5,Great Book! Great Rewrite!,"Firebird, Brennen, et al, are like old friends and I always enjoy spending time with them. Thyrica, Hesed House and Three Zed are so wonderfully rendered they seem like real places. I'd love to visit the first two! The action scenes - especially the air/space battles are loads of fun, and I also enjoyed the spiritual developments that have emerged in this version. The prophecies for Brennen's family add a lot to the story's tension and depth, and Firebird's ongoing attempts to find answers to the question of why God allows evil were thought provoking without being preachy. I recommend this book and its predecessor Firebird, as some of the best Christian fiction I have read. I can't wait for the next one."
5,Great.,"Works great. House is already staying a lot more cleaner. Will get two more. One for back door and one for garage. As another person put it, need to get the dogs to use it."
3,Great Boot Brush But,This brush does a great job but once you mount it to the ground it's hard to clean out the trapped dirt residue.
3,just ok,needs to have a stronger base and a heavier base.... it moves around too much when you wipe your golf shoes off
3,Boot scraper,"Problem is I put it on the ground and it moves when you put your shoe through it. It has screws to mount it but I can not use that application. I need it for anyone who passes through my gate at the backyard and it seems a bit narrow for the shoes we use. It is truly a ""Boot Brush"" with the high sides which would be fine for a work boot or sneaker but I would do better with a straight across brush since we use flip flops and sandles much of the time and the sides are too high for those type of shoes."
5,Great product,"Having a mountain farm can be murder on floors in the house. Mud, straw, chicken manure can create a nonstop cleaning agenda. I installed this on the wood crossties that create the steps up to the house and it has really decreased the amount of mud and junk coming into the house. The product is solid, installs easily with the included screws and when the scrubbers wear out (whenever that might be) you can buy replacements without trashing the entire thing."
5,Outstanding! Great material to persuade your family!,"Money causes endless disagreements in our home. We found this book a refreshing breath of fresh air! It easily allowed us to see what each of us was doing wrong. And we've had the fringe benefit of helping family members see their troubled ways. For example, the investing chapter shows how people who over monitor and trade more earn worse returns. It also cites that the daily tracking of investments is linked to poor mental health. The spending chapters allowed us to see specific ideas for questioning the way we approach purchase decisions. In the end, what's great about Mind Over Money is that the book got us to recognize and rethink our money habits and how we talk about money as a couple. We each had to give in on some things for the betterment of our family. Highly, most highly recommended five star book!"
5,Great starter lens,"My first DSLR, and my first lens. I bought a second-hand D200 and ordered this lens. I am very happy with the quality, and the focus speed is amazing. The VR function on the lens is worth its weight in gold while shooting free-hand. I am going to order the 55-300 Nikkor VR next as a companion to this lens. To anyone purchasing a lens, I seriously recommend this as a starter lens. It may be more than some of the others, but the cost is justified with the quality of the product. See my uploaded image (Even though it was condensed after upload) on the more pictures for this item. I wish I knew more things to say about this, but I am still an entry level photographer."
4,Nice and Small But Limited Focal Length,"I got this lens with my D50 about a year and a half ago. It is a nice, small lens with pretty good IQ. Decently sharp, not a lot of distortion, good color and contrast.I ended up replacing this lens with teh 18-135mm about 6 months later do to the focal length being a bit limiting on the 18-55mm and the 18-135mm being more useful in combination with the 70-300mm VR. I still have this lens, though, and occasionally use it when I want a small, light lens and know I won't need a lot of zoom."
2,Having some issues,Having some issues with this lens and my Nikon D90. Requires lots of adjustments. I would not recommend buying this lens.
4,Nice lens and quite good quality actually.,"It's a great lens, and the quality is definately nice. the field range is actually very nice, compared to Canon lenses of the same range, this has a greater depth of field, and at the most zoomed out level, it covers more area (although I fail to understand why?). I am using it with a Nikon d7000, and it actually also looks very good on the camera.The only thing I do not like is that is very quite. I am used to lenses making a noise as they rotate their focus or zoom, but this does not, which I guess is a good thing for a lens, but it's something I am not used to. Otherwise, it's a pretty great lens."
4,Good lens for the price.,"This was bought to replace a kit lens, which had some autofocus issues after 4 years of moderate use. The new lens works well, and even focuses in low light. The price is great, and the lens generates great crisp photos. I only question its durability."
4,Very good for the price,"For the price, you can't beat this lens. I've been using it for over a month and have had some very sharp results. There is a bit of distortion at the shorter focal lengths, but overall I am pleased. I've even had some results with long exposures at night (with tripod) at all apertures, where professional photographers have said ""wow"". It is light and easy to carry.My only complaint is that it's a bit slow (f/3.5).However, if you are weighing this lens with the Nikon 17-35 f/2.8, this lens is not a substitute. If you are not familiar with the 17-35, this 18-55 is probably the right lens for you. If you are weighing between the two, don't bother. Buy the f/2.8."
4,good zoom lens,the lens are the good kind of lens and the price is really good and everything is working good and isnt that heavy.
2,Ugh.,"This is a great lens. But it broke on the inside and wouldn't zoom anymore.I sent it to Nikon to be repaired, but apparently they won't touch it since it wasn't bought directly from Nikon. It's considered a ""Gray Market"" item."
3,"decent, but be gentle","So, this is the 3rd version of this lens I have owned. The first one came with the camera, and since then I have purchased two from Amazon. This is a great beginner lens. Does what it is supposed to do and produces nice images.The biggest problem I have with this lens is its construction. The reason I have bought 3. Now, I know I prob. should just pick a different lens, but this one is soooo compact and light! back to the construction, be careful of bumping, knocking and general use hazards, the previous 2 lenses have broken different parts internally, due to my clumsy nature.The other lenses I own have been through the same if not MORE and are still kicking. In fact I fell down about a 15 foot edge of a trail in Yellowstone 2 years ago with my 55-200VR IN MY POCKET and have had no problems with it."
1,Bad news,"I like to sample world music but this CD certainly didn't increase my enthusiasm for Swedish music. The CD was truly painful to hear. Some cuts were no more than 30 seconds - and they were very LONG 30 seconds. Some artists didn't sound like they'd ever sung publicly; overall sound quality was poor - like it had been recorded in a cave or someone's small back room on a tape recorder. Fortunately, I've sampled other Swedish music so I know there is some enjoyable music from that country, but this wasn't it, at least not for me."
4,"Simple, high-quality bow case.","This bow case is perfectly sized for my PSE Stinger 3G. I can fit the bow in there with a few arrows and a bow quiver, however the case feels a little stretched unless the bow is pretty bare. The zipper does not catch and is very strong. Great deal for the price."
4,bow case,"I thought it was nice buy for the price, however, I was going to use it as a case for a solar collector to charge boat batteries and sent it back because we found a better way to charge batteries. Service, delivery etc etc were great."
1,poor quality,"The clips on this item are horrible. I ordered two because my hubby looses his, well they both broke within the three 1/2 months since ordered."
4,Beautiful Quality - But Hair is a Bit of a Mess,"The Waitress is from the high end collector BFMC series. She is a 'silkstone' - made of a vinyl plastic that is similar in weight and texture to porcelain. Since she is in the BFMC series, her clothing and accessories are of the highest quality. Most BFMC dolls also have vintage faces.The Waitress wears a thick, crisply starched cotton pink uniform with tie on apron. A hat with clear plastic stays adorns her head and she comes with a thick clear plastic coffee pot. The uniform is beautifully made - the best feature of the doll, really.The one detractor (reason it is 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the hair is often quite a mess. Mine arrived new but the front of the hair was all over her face and had to be restyled as a result. So, with a little attention to detail, she becomes a lovely display and a great addition to a BFMC collection."
4,Pretty Waitress Barbie Doll,Barbie looks so special dressed in the waitress costume. The doll is made up of very sturdy material and is packaged in a very nice box. Just love it.
3,Ehh bigger bag is better.,My rabbit likes this hay. I tried getting him a more expensive better kind but he refused it. This bag wasn't my favorite. I usually buy the big 96 ounce bag since it lasts longer and is cheaper in bulk. I got this just out of desperation in not being able to find the big bag at the time. This bag the strands are veryyyy short and pokey. The grass just seemed very crappy and its hard to get it out of the bag without stabbing yourself with a sharp stalk. Probably would've been better if they cut the grass length wise instead of width. My bunny didn't like the short pieces as much. He also likes the furry part that is on top of the grass and this didn't have much since its cut so short. Probably seems dumb to some people but my rabbit is very picky. lol
3,Very disappointed...,"I usually buy this hay for my bun from my local Petland store. Last time I bought it, however, I decided to make the purchase on Amazon. Although I am very satisfied with the delivery time and price, I am VERY upset about the fact that upon opening the hay to feed our bunny, my husband found a huge dead beetle inside the bag. We were both disgusted and horrified for many reasons. What if we had overlooked it and our rabbit had eaten it, thinking it was a treat? Pretty sure that rabbits (who are herbivores) should not be eating dead beetles. Very disappointed."
2,Dry Hay,"Too dry, too many big, thick stems that the pets don't even touch, let alone like to eat. All in all, it's not worth even the low price."
1,All stalk,"This hay used to be suitable several years ago for my guinea pigs. Not anymore. It is the rough, tough bottom portion of the hay. And it is not sun-cured, it is burned brown. I've given it a few second chances in the last few years and it just keeps getting worse. They should look to Petco's store brand to see what it should be."
1,Terrible Quality,"This is the worst quality of hay. It contains mostly yellow straws and rarely any green hay. These are yellow straws and don't even look close to hay. I have purchased Kaytee's Timothy hay from Target in the past, but it was 10 times better. I think the vendor intentionally has swapped the hay with yellow straws. Don't even think of purchasing this hay. I am really frustrated. You cannot feed this quality to any living animals. I wanted give no star or negative stars for the rating, but I was forced to enter at least 1 star."
2,Not at all like the photo,"THe photo shows a high-quality, metal spout. What I got instead was cheap plastic. It keeps falling off the bottle, resulting in wasted product. Don't even bother buying this! It's a total rip-off. I contacted the company, but they were unapologetic and didn't offer to rectify the situation in any way. Hope the few bucks they made on this deal is worth sacrificing their reputation."
4,PURE.. SYMPATHY!,This is a much more brtual/melodic and streamlined P.S. This is album is in the likes of commercial succeses the Smashing Pumpkins if U can imagine them getting heavier and darker. Very original songs and alot of war chants and easy-listening melodies that are very heavy. Like an epic movie soundtrack. ENJOY!!!!
3,wow....new uses for bacon,"I found a copy of this book onmy doorstep the other morning. I suspect the neighbor across the street. She isnt part of the Arcticacre clan and sometimes we find her drinking from our hose and isolating certain blades of grass with these small but very detailed sponge figures. I thought one of them was me, until it rained.So, the book was there on my doorstep. I immediately started reading. I cant tell you how long I read the book, but it must have been three hours and twelve minutes. My favorite part was the part about how bacon is great in all sorts of bacon related food items. I just wish that they had some animated bacon cartoon characters on the cover and in a DVD inserted into the book. I dont like the idea of watching what I eat dance cutely, but with so may bacon recipes perhaps my neighbor has other plans.cheers, Joe Arcticacre"
3,Micro mini steel potatoe peeler,"This micro mini steel potatoe peeler is as strong as it comes. Especially durable during the harsh Russian winters, it can be used to peel potatoes for the making of home brewed Vodka or to be used to ward off hungry vampires. Can also be used to skin the inside of gourds or to shave the overgrown hair under a yak's hooves. May also be used to shave a beard in absence of any proper shaving utensil or as a talisman to chase off lethargic devils and big Russian women named 'Brobushka'."
4,Great album w/subpar recording quality,"Bluesy metal crunchers from the UK, with love-it-or-hate-it vocals from Kenny Stewart, is the 2nd of 3 Dirty Tricks releases in the mid-70's. This Majestic Rock re-issue on compact disc has a few pros & cons:Pros: Adds the 2 missing tracks not on the U.S. vinyl release, white still including my 2 favorites, ""Too Much Wine"" & ""Wait Til Saturday"", from the initial debut album.Add's some live performances.Cons: The 2 missing tracks, 2 & 4, have less treble attentuation than the other tracks.The live tracks are of poor quality, both in performance and audio, but are still an interesting listen, warts and all.Overall, a must-have for all new & old fans of 70's english rock and blues."
2,Caution: Vinyl Transfer NOT REMASTERD,"Ya gotta admire the ambition here. Nicely packaged, with original cover art and liner notes. Everything looks legit, down to the fine print, ""issued under license from Universal Music."" Well, they may have all the signatures and licenses, but they forgot to get the master tapes(!). The disc seemed to be sourced from a vinyl LP. Even for a vinyl transfer the final product here is mediocre at best. Anomalies exist throughout the CD, as if the source record was not cleaned. Also, either the stylus was in poor condition, or the anti-skate setting on the turntable was was not adjusted properly with the tone arm weight. ""Fuzzy"" would be my best one word description of this set.Nothing against the actual music though. The Dirty Tricks albums are really great obscure 70s hard rock, and deserve a legit reissue with attention to quality mastering."
3,pat comes back,"some good stuff from a rock legend. Pat's still got the most beautiful voice in Rock, and her husband's guitar playing enhances it perfectly. Some of the songs are a bit drippy, but for Benatar fans, there are some that will not fail to please. (Such as the opening track, Only You, and the fine Strawberry Wine)"
5,SUPER ALBUM!,WOW. ALL the songs on here are GOOD! I think my favorite songs are Strawberry Wine- it is SUCH a good song! and I Don't Want To Be Your Friend... it has spanish guitar and is pretty heartfelt and sexy. Papa's Roses is a powerful song...you just have to listen to all the lyrics. Dirty Little Secrets has beautiful guitar work and a really neat arrangement. Some of these songs have 2 or 3 layers of her voice at the end of the chorus but singing different notes... makes it neat to listen to. Basically... THIS ALBUM ROCKS LITERALLY. Another thing I like about it is the lyrics are very mature and real. I love this album!
1,Terrible waste of money,"I thought Pat Benatar was a good singer. Then I bought this lousy CD. I think its just terrible. What a boring album. I really think that this was the biggest waste of money. I paid 17 dollars for this CD, and hated it. I brought it to a place in Chicago and they wouldnt even buy it from me. I couldnt even get 3 dollars for it. They said no one wants pat benatar. No one even wants to be her. Pat doesnt even want to be pat."
3,The most comprehensive Ventilation Design Guide,"No surprise, it is easy to used as the desk reference like SMACNA "" HVAC Systems Duct Design"" & "" HVAC Duct Construction Standards"". It will not use impractical formula with no actual parameters given as contrast with others.The most impressive issues in Chapter 1'General Principles of Ventilation' is "" Blowing Versus Exhausting Figure 1-7"", which let us clearly to know : Oh! why we need more carefully when considering /sizing the exhausting system.This book also features with many simple to use illustrations and tables, which will not take you too much time to read it all.I have to say, it is the most been referenced handbook in many other HVAC publications, because it also includes many industrial environment condition, as I said in the very beginning, if you are an HVAC engineer, you should have this one and review this one before your design work commencement."
3,Intense and Fascinating,"What a disturbing little read this was! Wozencraft exposes us to a world most of us never knew or even imagined--the blurry lines between the good guys and the bad guys in the war on drugs.What makes this novel so disturbing is its ring of authenticity; its truthtelling grows until they final pages, when the moral of the story is exposed: 1) situational ethics applies in settings where it is morally wrong yet sanctioned by the law; 2) life is often not fair, and the evil often prosper.Her writing skills are excellent, and her ability to write expertly about these complex situations in the first person makes the novel intense and almost too painful to continue. She has real ability, although I'm not sure I want to read about such a depressing and sordid world about which she writes so capably."
4,rush review,"Rush, written by Kim Wozencraft, a narcotics officer has a constant struggle between her job and her addiction to narcotics. Kristen Cates (main character) partnered up with the top narcotics agent Jim Raynor with the Pasadena police department who got her started on narcotics. She finds many techniques on how to survive on the streets and keep her job. Jim dies from over use of narcotics and Kristen like all bad guys gets caught.Rush, is written in a style of its own. Love, suspense and intrigue. Rush, is written in the point view of a former narcotics agent (Kim Wozencraft) which really brings the book alive. Thoughts from her own experiences bring you to the scene no details left out. The audience keeps looking for more excitement"
3,Readable,I had wanted to read this book for a long time after seeing the movie. Unfortunately I had just as long been put off by the reveiws I read. In some ways true to the book and in others completely different. Thought provoking read for entertainment.
4,the remix single is better than the original,love the remix of sweet misery with an appearance by jadakiss. wish it were available in record stores
3,YET ANOTHER UNDERAPPRECIATED SLAUGHTER ALBUM HITS THE STREET,"This is the band's 4th studio album. Like Stick It To Ya, The Wild Life and Fear No Evil before it, Revolution contains a nice mix of hard rock from the groove oriented ""American Pie"" to the strip club ode ""Tounge in Groove"" to the seductive ""In The Heat of the Moment""(which is my personal favorite track), as well as the pop tunes ""Hard to Say Goodbye"" and ""You're My Everything"". The band has been consistent throughout thier career as far as thier music goes, however thier popularity seemed to end after thier first record, which included the hits ""Up All Night"" and ""Fly to the Angels"". Although their music isn't all that creative and original, it is very good and definately worthy of your attention. For some great rock and roll, look no further, Slaughter's got it for ya, again."
3,More than I expected........,"As I listen to more and more of the albums (post hairband days ones) from bands like Slaughter that are well after their heyday, I find more and more of them are not very good. Maybe it's my tastes in music is changing. Maybe it's because most of the bands try to change to be more like whatever is more popular at the time. Maybe it's just because they are not very good. I don't know. This CD, however, is pretty good. It's got a some songs that you will probably skip over, but some of the tunes are excellent. ""Stuck On You"" & ""You're My Everything"" are the best ones here. The latter sounding a bit poppy, but still very good. ""Tongue 'N' Groove"", ""Can We Find A Way?"", ""Hard To Say Good-Bye"", & ""Heat Of The Moment"" are the other good ones here. The rest is pure filler. But, I was very surprised at that two big songs I menioned. I have been listening to them non-stop for days. Give this CD a listen."
3,Slaughter - 'Revolution' (CMC International),"I've never been like the biggest Slaughter fan,but I've always liked their music to some degree.'Revolution' is their fifth CD and it really isn't bad.Former Vinnie Vincent Invasion vocalist Mark Slaughter and crew are apparently still into creating an almost 'Beatle-esque' sound like they did on their previous release 'Fear No Evil'.The Beatles weren't Slaughter's only infuence,listen to the Zeppelin-like ""Heaven It Cries"".Other well penned tunes include ""I'm Gone"",""Heat Of The Moment"",""Tongue 'N Groove"" and their cover of Joe Walsh's ""Rocky Mountain Way"".Not a bad find."
3,Decent Slaughter Release,"This album has some good tunes on it. Tracks like Tongue n' Grove and Heat of the Moment, make this Cd very enjoyable and are solid rock anthems. I'm Gone shows the band knows how to rock. However, there seems to be a lot of filler on this CD. I find myself pressing the ""Next track"" button on my CD player to avoid them. However, if you like Slaughter or 80's metal anthem tunes, check out this CD."
2,Disappointing,"The first slaughter album was quite impressive , i was expecting the same form on this album. I was quite disappointed , it lacks the same spirit and energy , one cannot classify this band as a hard rock band any more."
2,Save your wedding money...go to the library,"This book was not worth the money I spent on it. I judged a book by it's cover on this one, (or rather by flipping through and seeing pretty pictures) and judged incorrectly. I found this book to be lacking in the content department. It tries to cover a lot of topics, but in that respect, it only covers each topic for a few paragraphs, not going in to depth really on anything, and therefore not really being helpful for designing and planning a wedding. There were no helpful checklists or worksheets for planning, nor did it give the bride any idea about where to start planning! If you're looking for one book to solve all of your wedding information and/or planning needs, this is not the book. I reccommend The Knot guides, and also any specific guide that will help you with the kind of wedding you're planning to have (Catholic, Jewish, Destination, Ethnic, whatever). ..."
2,It's kinda OK..........,"Not the most robust workout dvd I have done. Desiree's fake bubbly talk gets annoying, she sounds so rehersed not to mention her voice is dubbed over the workout. All she is doing in the workout is SMILING :) SMILINGand trying not to look off balance. It's a shame the workout can bring a sweat if you put your all into the moves ---- I juust use it because I spent good money on it."
2,Not My Favorite,"This video turned me off the moment it started with the instruction. She explained EVERYTHING and not in a good way. She even felt the need to remind you when to go left or right even after you'd been doing that part for a bit. There was an option to turn the instruction off which might be ok if you are familiar with the workout but not when just starting. The cardio portion was lacking to me I hardly broke a sweat, but I do agree that it would be good for someone who is just beginning their workout regimine."
2,NOT What I was Hoping For,I was very excited to get the DVD and was disappointed with it. I didn't think it was that great of a workout and the instructor wasn't talking through the DVD but her voice was recorded over it and often the counts didn't match what she was actually doing. She was way too cheerful and fake! I won't be rushing home to do this workout anytime soon.
1,Curious,Curious how so much propaganda can be infused into a book which is is supposed to be a writing primer. If you can get around the America bashing it will rise all the way up to a rating of worthless. One star is one more than it rates.
2,Ouch! Not complete at all!,"Greetings,Nice book but there are tons of pistols and revolvers missing. The title is VERY misleading. It does not cover, as a reviewer stated the pistols and revolvers up to 2002. There are a lot missing.For example, the CZ section doesn't cover the C&R; that are currently available for a very low price through military surplus. The Taurus section doesn't cover the Millenium, rosies or the 24/7 selection. The Steyr section doesn't cover the M1A and on and on and on...If you think you can find the specs of that rare pistol or revolver in that book, you will not.Thank you"
4,A New Direction!,"After several mediocre releases on Blind Pig, Coco Montoya switched labels a couple of years ago opting to try his luck with Alligator. This is Coco's second release on Alligator Records and probably his best outing in many years. Alligator has had a lot of success over the years, jump starting and breathing new fire into stalled careers, most notably, Johnny Winter, Hound Dog Taylor, Buddy Guy, Luther Allison and now, Coco Montoya. On this disc, Coco can be heard to play his solos in a manner that would make his mentor, Albert Collins smile from ear to ear. The songs themselves have a rockish/popish quality both in the rhythms and the lyrics. While this is somewhat refreshing and at times enjoyable, Coco's vocals don't always suit the bill. ""I Won't Beg"", ""Can't See The Streets"" and ""Free"" all have a familiar sound that will have you trying to pin point where you have heard it before. Best blues cut on the disc is probably, ""Back In A Cadillac""."
5,Wonderful Quality,I bought this necklace to go with some silver butterfly earrings. They were a excellent match even though the necklace does not have butterflies it does have some finely executed flowers and bows. The necklace rest high on the neck although there is sufficient amounts of necklace to extend it if required. It is a very pretty piece of jewelry the photo does not really do it justice. It is also heavier than it looks it has plenty of silver in it. On the whole and excellent purchase well worth the money
2,Lost their way,"As a professional photographer, I think the organization that publishers this magazine have truly lost their way. The images are predictable and unimaginative and haven't changed in the past 25 years. There are much better magazines to read."
1,Not worth it.,"The articles are pretty short, meaningless and lots of ads. I was expecting tips and tricks for photography techniques and didn't really find anything useful. I would not spend money on this magazine."
1,WHAT WAS THE OTHER REVIEWER SMOKING?,"First off, the audio is bad. Second off, this is not even a concert...it is audio set to a different picture every song. Why would ANYONE that collects concert videos, like I do, want this POS? This happenned to me oce before on a Commander Cody DVD. Well, it is about the Money, isn't it Eddie??PS...I like his music, maybe I should have read what it was closer...but Eddie, HAVE YOU NO SHAME?"
5,The best essay on quintessence of human evolutionary issues.,"This,almost 40 years old book,written by one of the 20th century leadings geneticist,whose contributions in genetic of Drosophila and also ones in Synthetic Theory of Evolution are landmarks of modern evolutionary thought,contains polemic exposure of topics,ranging from historical development of Darwinism to such controversial issues as Eugenics,Racial differencies and Future of Mankind shaped by evolutionary trends.All pro and contra arguments are presented together with conclusions,thus giving to reader first-class knowledge of all main aspects of Human Evolution.This book is usefull today,partly because no other author had written insofar such boldly and thorough exposure of such difficult subject,but mostly because of its integrity,clarity and stylistic qualities,and that is what makes this book a classic one."
4,Good,"This product is good because it delivers 1090 calories with high protein, a massive amount of carbohydrates, and virtually no fat. The taste is not very good, but you should use a product like this or a weight gainer powder if you plan on growing muscle or, like me, you are a runner who is also a weight lifter. With the amount of calories you need to grow stronger or bigger from weight training, running will frustrate your strength and/or size goals. However, with a product like this, you get a fast and easy post-workout drink that has no preperation needed when you are exhausted or on the run. Also, it has a huge amount of carbohydrates in their simple form, which will absorb the quickest into your body when you need them the most - post work-out."
5,Bug Facts,Grandchildren enjoy this book to help identify what they have located outside while they play. Lot of info for young children to understand. The 8 yr old really enjoys reading it and learning about the different subjects. Good series of books!
4,Not your typical reference book,"Not only does this book provide inside information about the real estate industry but it shares real life stories about someone who has lived and breathed the industry for 30 years. This book gives you facts and figures about the industry that will help you market, sell and buy real estate. But, more importantly, it's an enjoyable and insightful read providing stories describing the insight and experiences of those involved, at all levels, in the process. This was an extremely informative read."
5,Excellent,"A page turner, this book will make you laugh, cry and yearn for more. I would love to see the ""Popewells"" five years later."
4,Outstanding early Delinsky,"This 1993 Barbara Delinsky book is her best early work I have read. Centered on two families that are intertwined by two decades of close friendship, the events of one fateful afternoon blow apart each of the relationships between and among them. And, by the way, other reviewers, was the catalyst action ""realistic""? People have messed up relationships in so many different and shocking ways that I was willing to accept the events as written. Besides, we hardly know the subjects when the events occur. Their characters unfold and develop in reaction to these severe tests of who they are and who they love.Now 20 years after it was written, there is an ongoing cultural debate in the US between ""moral relativism"" and ""moral rigidity"". More Than Friends picks its way delicately between the extremes and puts a human face on situations where you might say ""I would never..."" or ""I would always...""."
4,Nice holiday read,"I enjoyed this book, it was an easy read and perfect for a holiday. I wouldn't say she was as deep as Jodi Picoult which I was told was the case but a nice story all the same"
5,"It added wonderful humor to a realistic, intense story!","This book was a great combination of betrayal, humor, and real life decisions. I couldn't put this down! This is by far Barbra's best book! By the end I garentee you'll want another book just like it -and there aren't any."
1,Spontaneous adultery?,"This is the first book by this author I have read and I was very disappointed. I had trouble believing that Sam, who was in love with his wife and had an active and healthy sexual relationship with her, would suddenly, and for no reason other than excitement over winning a case, have sex with his wife's best friend. What ever happened to restraint? Adultery normally occurs when there are other problems in the relationship, and it appeared that Anne and Sam's marriage had been ideal. I had no sympathy for the character of Teke, the best friend. She was reading a letter from a man she had not seen in 20 years and was so overcome she would have sex with her best friend's husband? I don't buy it. Anne, the betrayed wife and the only sympathetic character in the book, eventually forgives everyone, and invites Teke to go on vacation with her and Sam. What woman in the real world would want her husband anywhere near his former lover? Don't recommend this one."
4,Couldn't put it down!,"In the begginning it was kinda confusing the way she started naming all the charachters but once that was done, and I finally got them straight this book was good. I couldn't stop reading it!"
4,An Oldie but a goodie!,"This is an older but wiser book about one of the great cities of the world. If you love London, you could do a whole lot worse than getting this tome!"
1,Stay Away,"DO NOT BUY!!! unless you are interested in a romance movie, not the 1947 movie. Made the mistake of trusting the information and not the picture."
2,Only for the collector,"To say the least, I was very disappointed by this ""live"" album. The reason I put ""live"" in quotations is because this isn't a very ""lively"" album. There is no crowd cheering what-so-ever! It makes me wonder why Bruce Dickinson & crew decided to release this? Part of the live album experience is to feed off the energy of the audience, and without that, it just sounds like the band is performing acoustically on a sound stage. Another complaint is that this 2 disc set contains 2 seperate concerts, but the concerts have basically the same song listing. One good thing about this collection is it looks very nice. It comes with a super nice booklet with plenty of pictures and liner notes from Bruce, and also some very nice picture discs. Other than that, only Iron Maiden/Bruce Dickinson collectors should get this set, and even the collectors won't listen to it."
4,"Not his best, but good enough for me","While this doesn't stand up to his best work with Maiden, I still like it very much. A heavier edge as well as a second guitar would help a lot. A great value getting both live and studio versions of the songs."
5,Excellently Live!!!,"More powerful versions of ""Tatooed Millionaire"" and ""Born in '58."" A very MOVING album with a lot of substance."
2,"If it weren't for the good price, this album would be a 1*.","Two CD's of almost identical set lists: one ""live"" in the studio (ZZZZ) & one ""live"" in concert. Call me a fanboy but why buy a live album if you don't get cool song intros & audience response? Well, that's what you get with CD# 2. Standout tracks are ""Tears of the Dragon"", ""Born in '58"", ""1000 Points of Light"", & the rousing set closer ""Tattooed Millionaire"". Although Bruce waxes enthusiatic about his new bandmates, I find their playing half-assed and uninspired. Their mediocrity is only highlighted by all the dead air on Disc 1. It's no wonder that Bruce had his greatest commercial & critical solo success with the thouroughly superior Roy Z & his Tribe of Gypsies. Bruce's singing, of course, is superb. Unfortunately, since Bruce's first two solo albums are seemingly out of print, this CD is the only way to hear any of those tunes without looking for a needle in a haystack."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ONE!,This CD sucks. Here's an idea for you: a two CD set with the same songs on both CDs. What were they thinking? And the songs themselves are not up to standard for Bruce. I was robbed buying this CD -- don't you be.
5,POWER METAL AT IT'S BUTT-KICKIN' BEST!!,"If you love hard-drivin' bass & drums that give a solid punch to your gut, rippin' guitar that will leave you shredded and Goliath-like vocals that are strong and clean..add this CD to your collection. This CD will fit right in with your AC-DC, Judas Priest,Krokus,UFO,Kiss,Tesla,Motley Crue,Skid Row,Helloween,Dokken-ect. The production is perfect for turning up nice and LOUD!"
5,Treble Clef Necklace,"The necklace is very beautiful, even better than I expected it to be. Arrived promptly. An excellent purchase and seller. Thank you!"
2,Go with the DVD version,"My comments only concern the DVD versus Blu-ray issue.I have the the DVD version and the Blu-ray version. My experience has been that DVDs mastered in high definition look identical to the Blu-ray version (either on a Blu-Ray player or an upconvert DVD player). Although the DVD version has a very good transfer, I could see slight improvement in the Blu-ray version. (The branches on the trees in the first scene had slightly better definition.) On the other hand, it really didn't matter for most of the movie.The real problem with the Blu-ray version was the lack of special features. The only feature was the trailer. In contrast, the DVD version has two commentary tracks, deleted scenes, and a photo gallery. If you don't care about the features and are willing to pay a bit more for a slightly more defined picture, then go with the Blu-ray. If you want the extras, go with the DVD."
1,more liberal guilt,"I should have read the reviews before buying the disc.This film might be of interest to young people who think history is what they had for lunch Yesterday. I am sick and tired of the liberals screaming racist from the roof tops.Its always the evil racist white men, and the nobel black man. Yes in the past we had a lot of racism But that is in the past.No wonder this film bombed at the box office."
1,disapointed,I'd give the book 5 stars but the movie is barely deserve one. The movie is based on the book and so the story is really very different. The plot lines in the book that made it a great book were either changed or completely left out. The story was so different that it is a wonder it even had the same title. Why base a movie on a book and then completely change it? There just wasn't enough substance to this movie. It seemed like much ado about nothing and didn't have any depth to it.
2,DISAPPOINTING !,"Ok the actors are good but I expected something else.In this movie, the German soldiers and officers are just too kind ! I don't think that finally the whole story is believable.Don't expect the usual War movie with this one,You will finish in a court room mostly ! It's full of moral,justice,pride,honour...seen in far better acts before To end,this movie could have lasted 1:30 instead of the 2 LOOOOOOONNNNNNGGGGGG hours : an eternity !"
3,Slow moving but overall entertaining film,"Being a fan of Bruce Willis, I was looking forward to seeing this film. The first 3/4 of the picture are totally misleading. (I won't give anything away but this portion of the picture is what causes the viewer to end up appreciating the film in the end.) Unless you are die hard fan of Willis (pun intended) or a war buff, buy this DVD. If not, rent it before you decide."
4,Harts War,"This movie was good, but not the best WW2 movie I've seen. Colin Farrell and Bruce Willis are good in this movie...but then again they're both great actors!! So yeah. It got kind of boring at some parts. It could have been better but it was a war movie and it had Colin Farrell so I was happy!! If you're really into war movies, I suggest you watch this movie, but don't expect it to be this all out great movie. I don't suggest you buy it, just rent it."
4,Everything but the Kitchen Sink,"This film touches so many issues that you need a score card. The emotions that it elicits are its greatest value. Bruce Willis plays a very enigmatic character and gives the meaning of underplaying a role a new definition. Great photography, evasive dialogue and a very moving score actually save this one."
1,If you like war movies skip this one,"This movie is a politically corect drama. If you want a war movie see Siege at Firebase Gloria, Platoon Leader, or We Were Soldiers instead. I found this movie to be a wate of my time and really can't recommend viewing this dog."
2,Where's the history?,"A movie based on WW2 backdrop should at least remain somewhat historical in it's context. The implausible storyline, added with a hyped up propaganda laced motif makes for one sorry flick."
1,"I agree with the ""thumbs down"" group","My only addition to the negative reviews: Bruce Willis shouldn't play army colonels - he's not very good at it. His ""acting?"" Just look pissed off, with one facial expression, and whisper your lines in a tough way. I think he was over-paid. Luckily, I saw it on TV. It's now erased."
3,It was worth seeing...,I enjoyed the movie & I'm glad I saw it. I haven't decided yet if it's a keeper or not. I expected there to be more action then there was. I'd recommend seeing it at least once.
2,Save your time,"I was going to give this 3 stars, as it's well-shot, decently done in most ways, and really not bad.But, I can't say I would recommend it. Too many implausibilities in too many ways along with no character you really care much about adds up to just another WWII flick, with a ham-handed cheeseball ending.I watched it only because I loved Hoblit's Fallen, but aside from the visual quality (very nicely composed shots and a busy but intelligent camera POV are the highlights of the film), this film leaves no lasting impression. Some pleasant moral platitudes, but it just never hits your gut. The actors are fair, but don't have too much to work with.I wanted to like this movie but it never really gave me a reason to."
2,"Starts out with a bang, but....","then incredibly lapses into a ""Oh, feel sorry for da black man"" flick.I'm sorry people, but this is nothing but more brainwashing coming out of the propaganda matrix called Hollywood. And the premise that this film presents that even the Germans were more sympathetic to blacks than your basic poor Southern white trash makes me SICK!I can't tell you how this one ended cause I frisbee'd the DVD out the back door about half way through. Blockbuster can send their own goon squad back there to find the damn thing. 1 star, and I'm being kind."
1,Two big name actors may not make a film.,"Make a movie starring two of the hottest men in the business and you have a hit movie? Not exactly. Bruce Willis and Colin Farrell can bring in an audience, but movies that have to do with Germans, Russians or Middle East just are not popular anymore. I was disinterested with the film .Bruce Willis, with all due respect, is almost a natural for this role. He was born in Germany and is half-German in real life. But I am glad he's all American. This disc offers Full Screen and Wide Screen. Special Features are on the Widescreen side. Special Features are ten unrated deleted scenes, Audio Commentary with Bruce Willis, Director Gregory Hoblit and the writer. Another Audio Commentary with the Producer, David Foster, Photo Gallery and Theatrical Trailer."
2,God awful,"If you ever feel the compulsion to rent this movie or (god forbid) buy it, you have to read the book first. Then and only then iwll you have the backdrop nessacary to understand the movie."
3,A workmanlike film with solid acting,"""Hart's War"" features decent performances by Bruce Willis and Colin Farell in a somewhat convoluted story set in a German POW camp late in the war. Lt. Hart is a Senator's son who has managed to get soft duty for most of the war. Suddenly he finds himself captured, tortured, and in a POW camp. When black American fighter pilots are brought to the camp, they face prejudice and a trumped-up court-martial in which the inexperienced Hart is appointed defense counsel. This all sounds straightforward, but in reality there is a convoluted sub-plot that I will not give away in this review. There is an interesting angle of fraternization with the German camp command that I found somewhat unrealistic, but who can say?Overall, this is a workmanlike POW film. Its main flaw in my opinion is its lack of plausibility. Still, an entertaining film. RJB."
3,I Was Surprised!,"I was unsure of the idea of making this story a movie. However, the dramatic performance is just so good that I had to tell all who expect little from this one..."
2,"Slow, plodding.... and boring","Hart's War could have been a good movie if the director had cut about twenty minutes out of the running time. Instead, we are left with a slow plodding movie that tries to milk the tension out of every scene with lingering camera shots of characters giving anguished facial expressions in response to the moral dilemmas they are facing in the film.This movie has little action and instead relies on interaction between characters to build tension in drama. Too much time is spent watching characters do nothing. A quicker movie would have been better because the cast is appealing and the story is pretty good, if not someone far fetched."
1,"Great book, poor movie","If you are in the movie-making business, you must first read John Katzenbach's book (Hart's War) and then watch this movie. It is a good learning tool on how to turn a great book into a poor movie. I cannot believe how the director was willing to direct this movie (I am assuming he read the book). The movie has practically nothing from the book, and as a stand alone film, it leaves much to be desired."
2,ugh...,"well, this is one of colin farrell's not great movies. i thought the plot wasn't really organized enough so i had to pay a lot of attention to this stupid movie. this movie wasn't very good and i don't recommend this to anybody."
4,A very good WWII movie!,"Hart's War is a truely well made movie. Bruce Willis does an excellent job, once again, of showing why he's one of the best. The movie itself is about a senator's son that is intentionally kept well behind enemy lines. He volunteer's to take a field officer back to his unit. On the way, he run's into the Germans and is captured. Early on, he succumbs to the torture and gives up information to his interogator. He's then sent to a stalag. COL McNamara (Bruce Willis), debriefs him and easily discovers that he gave up information. The Colonel immediately doesn't trust him and quarters him with enlisted soldiers. Not long thereafter, two Tuskegee airmen are captured and the Colonel quarters them in there as well. Obviously, this is the 1940's and immediate tension comes from this. Without ruining the story for those who've not seen it yet, I'll leave at that. Once again, this is a very good movie. Definitely watch this movie."
1,Hogan's Heroes,"If you want even one iota of anything approaching realism then forget this movie. Because it has Germans in the movie it, of course, has the obligatory Malmedy Massacre scene along with the Jews being deported on trains scene and the Germans are all ruthless nazis etc, etc. The scene in which the American POWs form the letters ""POW"" in order to stop a low level air raid is pretty hilarious. The plot is poor and the acting even poorer. As usual for an American film everything explodes in flame: one wonders if American special effects producers have actually ever seen an explosion. The film looks as though it was derived by reading an old style war comic. It is bad. ..."
4,A good war movie,I truely enjoyed this film. For the first hour and thirty minuets I thought it was about one thing only to find out that the introduction and complication were merely subterfuge. It was cleverly composed and very well acted. And Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors.
4,"Willis and Farrell, good combination","you get Colin Farrell(American Outlaws, Tigerland, PhonBooth, DareDevil, Ordinary Decent Criminal and SWAT) and you team him with Bruce Willis(Armageddon, Mercury Rising, Tears Of The Sun and The Bonfires Of The Vanaties), you get a winning combination. The beginning where Farrell gets kidnapped is a grabber of an opening and the end where Willis shoots himself in the head is shocking but hey hes a good actor. its a little bit overlong but dont let that ruin it for you. Cole Hauser also stars, Hauser was in Tigerland with Farrell and later stars in Tears Of The Sun with Willis. a war movie for any war movie fan"
5,A GREAT MOVIE,ok so u may think that this movie looks really cheesy . THINK AGAIN. if u have a 5.1 surround sound setup this movie is great. Even better if u use a projector or a big screen TV. the acting is great the ploy is even greater. all in all BUY it
1,Lady Killer (Not what is advertised!!!),"This is NOT!!! the DVD that is advertised!!!Barbara Feldon and Robert Powell are not in this DVD!!!!If you are looking for the DVD probably tilted ""Policy of Death"" starring Barbara Feldon and Robert Powell DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
1,They make good tv's but not microwaves,"I needed a second microwave for our office so I purchased this. I thought to myself, Panasonic is a good name i'll try it. WRONG!. It died after about a month and the customer service support to fix it was awful. I tossed it in the dumpster and purchased a Sanyo EMU1000. Sorry Panasonic, the public has a right to know...."
3,Suddenly stopped working after 3 years,"I bought this item on Oct 1st 2003. It worked well no problems until Nov 1st 2006. All of a sudden it stopped working, it is not getting power. I checked in different outlets and no luck. To think it was gone by power surge, everything else was working fine."
4,Goldwin Albert Smith,"I had Dr. Smith as my professor for English History at Wayne State University in Detroit, MI. I still keep this book on my boofshelf as a quick reference. A very readable and detailed one volume history which I cherish."
3,Little dry,This does offer some good insight into Salomon Brothers but unfortunately the author does not have the same gift with words that Michael Lewis does. This would be an amazing book had it been written by Michael Lewis. I found it a struggle to read more than 10-15 pages at a time.
2,Very Dry and Dull,"I would term this book a nightmare. This book is about as dry as three day old non-buttered toast. The authors premises is that the activity on Wall Street during the 80's - the junk bond M & A items will kill corporations due to the debit levels thus decimate the equities markets. Not that this is that unique of a thought and the book only gets duller from that point. I picked this book up because I wanted to learn something, but the wooden writing turned me off so much I finally had to close the book after the longest 100 pages in my life. Unless you are a relative or friend of the author I would suggest continuing to look for other titles."
4,"Think you know the presdents, then check this book out.","We have had 43 presidents and I am sure that a book could have been written with thousands of questions about them, this book only has 101 and I was amazed and how tough they were.The other books in the series seemed relatively easy compared to these questions. The only thing I saw was that there was no pictures of the presidents and this should be a part of the book.The book does provide some new material and from the reading I don't think there was a question on each president. Overall another good book to add to the reference library."
1,DOES NOT WORK ON A MAC!!,This product has not worked on a mac for the past 18-24 months and perhaps never since OS 10.3! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS IF YOU INTEND TO USE IT ON A MAC. The company does not support anyone's complaints and directs them to Apple for a solution.The product is still marketed for cross platform use and the company knows it does not work - do not support this company!
2,Recorded on a tape recorder in a shoe box.,"The sound on this CD is crap, it sounds like you are outside the concert hall listing to this. Grab a copy of the UK 12"" singles of I am I'm Me and The Kids are Back if you can which have three live songs each and really shows the true power of the SMF's live."
3,Alarming and Disturbing,"As a parent of teen who struggled with major depresson and survived a suicide attempt, I was looking forward to reading this book. But I was stunned and dismayed at Mr. Raeburn's pitiful lack of abiltiy to come to terms with his childrens' suffering and further, his failture to take appropriate measures. The level of self-absorption and selfishness both he and his ex-wife (albeit we only hear his side of the story) exhibit, their inability to put the needs of their children first and their mutual failure to address the many behavioral and psychological needs of their struggling teens left me despairing. Are there really legions of parents out there who, when faced with severely disfunctional children, perform so badly?Raeburn gets points for honesty, and he adds to the literature on bi-polar chldren, but for all the good it does, the book is more about his own failings than the mental illnesses his children suffer."
2,Angry and discouraging,"Mental Illness is not a warm, fuzzy topic, but Raeburn's account of dealing with his mentally ill child offers little hope, encouragement, or direction. Additionally, it implies that family dynamics and social situations may be at the root of illness rather than biology, as proven over and over by science and medicine alike. If you want a parent's perspective that provides both the unvarnished truth and a real sense of hope, power, and wellness, read Kate McLaughlin's ""Mommy I'm Still in Here"" instead.Mommy I'm Still in Here: Raising Children with Bipolar Disorder"
3,On depression,"Quite well done, altho I thought the author spent too many paragraphscomplaining about his ex wife, rather than how he struggled tounderstand the depression(s) of his children..cyn smith"
3,Give the man a break!,"I'm amazed at how angry and judgmental these reviews are. Many readers seem confident that they would handle Paul Raeburn's situation better than he did. Unless they've walked in his exact shoes, they should give him a break. There's no recipe for perfect parenting, especially in such an unlooked-for situation. Have the rest of you all really managed it so well? Like Paul Raeburn, I'm still struggling to do okay."
2,Basic comfort changing pad plush cover is too small for this pad.,"I was surprised to discover that the Basic comfort plush changing pad cover does not fit onto these pads, despite the the fact that the measurements indicated on the packaging specify that they should be a perfect match (same brand, same size). When I tried to place the cover over the pad, the bottom buckled and was clearly the wrong fit. I hadn't even washed the covers yet. I returned them both as I'm not sure which product was manufactered with the wrong measurements.Fortunately Amazon was cooperative and the items were easy to return."
2,Seam has come apart,"While the design of this item is excellent, the workmanship is poor. After less than six month one of the corner seams has come apart. We leave the pad in place and didn't stress the seam in any way. Of course, this makes the item useless since it's no longer sanitary."
4,Amazing find,"Take it from someone who reads a lot, and has tried to do some of his own writing: this guy can write, serious. I picked it off the shelf and was immediately sucked in big time. The only warning i might give is that his subject matter is pretty specific, and if you're not into cutting edge hard nosed ugly reality based like stories, you probably won't go for it. This is not for reading in the park on a sunny day."
5,This is one hell of a trip!,"Judson writes with undeniable power and street savvy. The generating forces of the narrative, as well as its effect, is intensely brutal and unsettling."
4,well-written mystery,"The author has worked in law enforcement for years and it shows. The book is a well-done, fast paced mystery with enough twists and turns to keep it interesting. The nuanced protagonist makes for an interesting read. I look forward to reading more books by this author."
3,Numbers too small,I like the design on this thermometer. The problem is that the numbers are too small. I had to change the location of where I put it so it is closer to the house so it can be seen.
3,Grizzard Goes Under,"All in all ""I Took a Lickin' and Kept on Tickin'"" was a middle of the road book... Not great, not bad. A better title might be 'too stupid stubborn, and lucky to die'... until he does after the book is finished.It's been a few months since I read this one, but mostly I remember wanting to scream at the book... You moron.. let them amputate the finger and get on with your life... but noooooo..... Grizzard will have none of that. He'd rather wind up enduring more open heart surgery than sacrifice a finger gone bad.Whether the bad finger ultimately killed him I don't know, but clearly it didn't do him any favors along the way. And likely contributed to his demise, if it didn't just outright kill him.While written as humor it's difficult to take it all as funny when what you're reading is a tale of how one man was too stubborn to listen to the medical experts who'd already saved his life at least once. Ultimately it's a sad frustrating book to read."
5,Live show,Man these guys are so awsome. I wish the industry would hurry up and make them stars so that every one could hear them because they (excuse the trite-ness) rock. They are compleetly fresh and entergetic and... uh... yea they rock. Quit reading this and go buy the damn album.
3,"good acting, terrible story","though the actors are well casts, the movie just doesn't really work. The film is so dark from the beginning (look wise I mean) it is hard to watch. Also, even though this was a low budget indie, that doesn't make up for sloppy film making. Though Rachel Hunter has no purpose in this film and they shouldn't waste money on hiring her for that little cameo (could have spent money to reshot the scene when you can see the camera guy) the rest of the cast is great, especially Jonathan Silverman and Jessica Lundy as the sarcastic divorced couple who broke up over a magor misunder standing. Watch Silverman as he confesses his dirty little secret"
5,"A Terrific, Thought Provoking Laffer!","""Just A Little Harmless Sex"" combines a universally laffable situation, a terrific cast, and some of the snappiest dialogue to come out of the independent filmmaking of the nineties. Lauren Hutton makes a return to the big screen with a brilliant performance as the sagely, yet alluring matron, overseeing her thirty-something children and their matrimonial indescretions. Jonathan Silverman fans won't be disappointed either. I've screened this film a few times now and never fail to discover new things to laugh at. I'm sure this will pop up on top 10 lists in the future as one of the best comedies of recent times for those fortunate enough to have seen it."
1,Very poor dvd quality,"The dvd came on time and undamaged, but the quality of the dvd was very poor. In my opinion this dvd is a poor copy and not a used original. I do not recommend buying this dvd from this source."
2,Harmless Fun,"Those who like shows like ""Sex and the City"" will certainly enjoy this romantic comedy about a group of hip friends in their late twenties. Their problems are essentially trying (and mostly failing) to find a sex partner and eventually a loved one. Infidelity, friendship, maturity and life choices are some of the subjects present in this little movie, providing a couple of laughs but not many memorable scenes. The acting is competent, the pacing is ok, but the plot and direction are nothing to write home about. All in all, a watchable flick and an entertaining enough one, even if it doesn`t rise above average material.Good to watch once."
2,Made-for-cable schlock,"""Random Encounter"" tries to make Elizabeth Berkeley look like a good actress but it cant be done, sorry. the story is so-so, and very by-the-book."
5,Good clips,"These clips are great, I just wish they had an even number of colors, it feels like they left out one. The paint on the is great on the outside of the clip but they missed the inside, If that is something you'll even worry about. Overall great clips so far!"
1,Frustrated with Image Entertainment,"I purchased this set on release date. I finally got around to watching disc 4, except that I was unable to view the programs. I was unable to get the disc to load on my Samsung BD-P1500. I was up to date on my firmware. The disc at first would spin and spin and lock up the player. I e-mailed Image to report the problem and received no response. Another update was available from Samsung and I updated the player again. The disc would spin and give me a written message that the disc was unplayable. I again e-mailed Image and still no response. Since Image is slow to acknowledge the problem and offer a solution, I returned the set for a full refund. I really wanted to keep this set as the visual quality is stunning. I cannot support a company that refuses to admit a mistake and offer to correct it."
1,Play-back issues!,"I first ordered this set on 9/12/10, and the discs arrived would not play or load....NONE OF THEM! So, I sent the set back to Amazon, & ordered a second set. Well, the second set of discs wouldn't play either. Bummer."
5,Good Produce,The Product I was received was really good. I really enjoyed it. It was not damaged or anything. I would recommend this to anyone. I will do more business with Amazon.
1,"Looks Great, if it plays!","My first review for a product on Amazon.I would have given this set 5 stars, if it played. I had read of the problems on this set. Then Amazon stopped selling it, put it up for review. Then they started to sell it again, and on sale for under $58. Took the leap of faith, and bought it!As soon as the set arrived, I went right to one of the episodes I read was ""problematic"", The Big Tall Wish on disc 4. Sure enough, the episode freezes at 12:30, and will not stat playing again. I skipped to the next episode and the disc would freeze, and skip.Image needs to address this, and I hope Amazon stops selling it (for good) until this problem is resolved.I am playing this on a Sony BDP1000ES, a great player, that has played everything, up to this point. I have the latest firmware too. Hope this gets fixed, cause I would love to own it, and give it 5 stars!"
5,Good for Now,"Yes, technology evolves. No stopping it. A few years ago I bought a nice big box of TZ laser discs. Enjoyed the heck out of it. BTW, it included video footage of Serling's discussions with students which is NOT included in this DVD set.Nevertheless, this is a boffo set. The audio is very much improved over the previous DVD's. Example: Listen to the pronunciation of the letter ""S"" in Walking Distance (particularly during Serling's voice over late in the episode). In the older CBS disc it is VERY distorted. That was the disc with the annoying rolling-eyeball-menu. Anyway the new version is crystal clear.These images look AT LEAST as good if not better that the original broadcasts. Yes, we will have hi-def ""soon"", but for early B&W; TV these are gonna keep me happy for a good while."
2,BUYER BEWARE,"Be aware that Discs 1 and 4 DID NOT operate on my Sony Blu Ray. Disc 4 DID NOT operate on my Sharp Blu Ray. I returned this product to Amazon. I guess quality control is not a high priority at Amazon. I am a Twilight Zone fan and was extremely disappointed. The quality of the discs that worked was excellent, it was like I was watching the epidsodes when they first aired. I kind of wished that they had included some of the commercials from back in the day. Due to the excellent quality of the discs I was able to watch is the only reason I gave it two stars. Now I am a hesitant to purchase Season 2 when it is released."
5,Twilight Zone Season 1,"Those of us of a certain age will remember being enthralled by this programme, staying up late to watch it. Many of us would not get its political and moral undertones that would not be allowed on television at the time.Most of us watched television in black and white on a small 'tube' with an analogue signal. Watching this today made the whole thing more vivid than the original ever could have been and the stories are just as relevant today.Those of us who still hum the show's theme music when something weird happens will be slightly disappointed as it was not used for this season. However I could watch it all aagain until the picture vanishes into that little white hole in the center of the screen."
5,Great! Great! Great!,"I have always wanted to own The Twilight Zone Definitive Editions on DVD, espically Season One, and I have finally got my wish.The Twilight Zone is a classic and a very enjoying show. The quality on these sets are so excellent and sharp that its hard to believe that this was a classic 1960's show. I can honestly say that these are well worth it for their prices. If you haven't brought the Twilight Zone yet, please get it now, and you want be dissapointed."
4,"Very good histories - although old, it is very entertaining.","I recommend this for all who like science fiction and fantasy tales and don't need lots of especial effects in order to enjoy the film.The image quality is amazing for an old black and white series.the sound is very good, despite a white noise now and then.Some episodes are very predictable, but I enjoyed then anyway."
3,Why isn't this set closed captioned?,"I own the complete set of The Twilight Zone from Seasons 1 through 5. The sets for Seasons 2-5 have closed captions. They are a blessing because we are able to completely enjoy the programs which were part of our childhood years. Why isn't Season 1 captioned???? When can we expect Image or another company to pick up the ball and get that season captioned? I have no doubt that if this is done, many customers with hearing loss will surely want to get their hands on that set and watch the proceedings. The explanation for my rating is that a 5 is given to the quality of the Twilight Zone programs and a 0 for the lack of captioning which provides an overall rating of 3."
1,Twilight Zone Definitive Edition episode is missing,"This does not include all episodes. If I look at Season 1, it is missing the pilot episode shown on 11/24/58 named ""The Time Element."" What else is missing I wonder? Im not sure I should spend the money if this is how it is. I'd like a reply from those who know what the original episodes really were. Thanks!ETA: I gave it a rating of 1 because I havent bought it yet."
5,step into the Twilight Zone,If you're old like me and loved TZ the first time around you're going to love this. These episodes aired from 1959 to 1964 and watching them is like going back in time. You can recapture a time when our society had a real sense of direction. Every story has a moral to it. If you're young and you're not a zombie yet you may find it a very enlightening experience. :-)
5,Don't listen to them!!!,"The Twilight Zone box sets that are allready out are AWFULL and I pity any fool who put their money into the extra-less, out-of order DVDs. THIS is the one to buy! They are jealous because they aren't going to see the great extras on this release. The cover art sucks, though...Anyway, this is an INCREDIBLE show and well worth the (okay, so it is quite expensive) price tag. The extras look to be very good and the shows have been cleaned up and are now in a logical order. Make no mistakes, if you are going to buy this show on DVD, THIS is the release to get, not those crappy other box sets."
1,disc 4 won't work,I've got a playstation 3 and after installing the latest update disc 4 will not load. I get a message that disc is not a playable disc. Since i did not order it from here I can't return it. I do have season 2 and 3 on order here but cancelling and I'll just stick to my dvd's of the show.
3,seasons 2 & 3 close captioned,"i didn't buy the first season because it had neither captions or subtitles which are important to my brother who is hearing impaired. thankfully, both seasons 2 & 3 are captioned so I went ahead and bought them both. season one is a great show but I have to give it 3 stars because of lack of captioning."
5,English Subtitle or Closed Caption,Can anybody confirm is there an English subtitle or Closed Caption in this edition? There were mistakes in some other Product details (10 Movies Film Noir for example).
5,The Best!,"What can I say except that the delivery was fast, the product is one of the best purchases I've made in a very long time. Thank you!"
2,not the Twilight Zone it was to become,"I purchased this first season hoping for a fun nostalgic Halloween viewing with friends, and it turned out that Rod Serling was just warming up here. The classic music was not a part of the episodes that we watched, and the (four?) episodes- out of many, it's really a lot of episodes- were all about alone-ness. After seeing these few, I wonder if Serling was in a reflective, perhaps depressed time of his life. They may have been ground-breaking at the time, but they aren't the mind twisters that I recall from late night television. Maybe season 2 is better?"
1,"I agree, corporate GREED.","Give me a break. I am soooo tired of studios releasing version after version of the same movies. Think about how ridiculous it is: special editions, extreme editions, unrated editions, director's cuts, collector's editions, Ultimate edition's, etc. But when they start re-releasing TV shows, this is total BS!! I am sticking with the versions I have and NOT buying into this corporate greed!! I am sick of it!!!! Expecting people to pay over and over agian for the SAME thing. Oh, let's just add a few more extra features, make the picture a little better, and make MORE money. These fools will buy it. That's right. If you buy it again, you're a fool. Don't support this BS!! If people stop buying these re-issues, maybe they will stop doing it and release it right the first time!!!!!!"
3,Discs 2 & 4 would not play on my Samsung Blu ray player.,"I love the series. It is my all time favorite TV series,and was so excited when Season 1 arrived. Watched the first disc, played beautifully. Popped in the second disc and tried several times. It would not load. Disc 3 worked great. Disc 4 would not load Had to send back.Bummer."
1,3 Sets of Bad Discs,I am in the process of returning the 3rd set of T.Z. Season 1 on BD. Disc 1 of each set refuses to play on my BD player. Totally disgusted
2,No closed captions,"Had to sell my copy of this excellent box set because it has no closed captions! I'm hearing impaired; so therefore for the money retailed for this, it should have closed captions. Now excuse me while I go get some cheese for my whine."
5,ESSENTIAL COLLECTION FOR TWZ FANS...BUT...,"I agree with some of the reviewers that: (1) this should have been the first collection of TWZ put out; (2) they're trying to price-gouge fans; and (3) it should have subtitles.But with that said, every TWZ fan will want this collection. The video and audio are definitely much better than before...I compared it with the previously released collection. Also, the special features are very nice to have.Also, it is immensely more fun watching the shows in the original broadcast order instead of all mixed up as in the last collection.Buy this collection...you won't be sorry!"
4,Twilight Zone Blu-Ray,"Too Expensive!. I would say that the official TZ DVD release is good enough ..if not great. Put your $ into the Boris Karloff THRILLER DVD series to be released Aug. 31, 2010. Now that's $ well spent."
1,You are travelling through a financial dimension...,"Who are they kidding? Themselves? I'll admit the extras are tempting.... but didn't I just rebuy these in slimline sets that are not in any order with no extras at all for this price? Sorry Image Video/CBS but it is you that is made of money not us. I rebought the Star Trek series for the sake of condensing the series, but there just isn't enough incentive for me to rebuy this. What's next? The Superlative Edition in which we go on a dig for Serling himself? Gimme a break."
1,"Amazing series, horrible experience with Amazon and producers","Like hundreds of others out there, all 4 of my discs have different degrees of defects. Disc 1 and 2 skip, Disc 3 randomly returns to the main menu, and disc 4 just flat out won't load. Why Amazon hasn't been willing to fix this in the past three months speaks volumes to how dedicated they are to selling quality products. There are dozens of documented cases of defects, yet they only randomly pull the product in one week increments, and then relist it and hope that nobody notices.Come on Amazon, either stop selling it entirely, or do a full recall until you get a new shipment of product from the manufacturer. It's dishonest to continue selling a product you know is defective."
4,Excellent First Season Collection,"Having viewed the six DVD's in this set, I have to say that CBS/Image finally got it right. The image transfers are as good as you can get (being from the original film negatives) the same can be said for the audio. I was glad they left in the ""bumpers"" and CBS show promos at the tail ends of each episode. My only reasons for giving this collection 4 stars instead of 5 is because some of the ""next week show promos"" are audio only, which (to me) means either the video quality was really poor, or there was some sort of sponsor tag on them burned in (I believe the former would be the more likely scenario). The other is, on the Extras DVD, they have the original billboards for the show. I would've preferred that they inserted these where they were originally before the first commercial, instead of giving us a comp reel of them. I'm definitely looking forward to season two when it's released in March, 2005."
4,Definitive Edition?,"This looks to be a fine collection Image Entertainment has put together, with lots of bells and whistles, but if it's a Definitive Edition then why wasn't the ORIGINAL 'pilot,' from 1958, included?""The Time Element"" was aired in November of 1958. It was scripted by Rod Serling and intended to be the pilot episode for TTZ, but CBS instead showed it on Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse. It starred William Bendix and Marin Balsam. It's about a man who has a recurring dream that he's at Pearl Harbor on December SIXTH, 1941. The show received such favorable viewer response that CBS ordered up a TZ pilot. RS wanted ""The Time Element"" but now couldn't use it, so he delivered to them ""Where Is Everbody."" That 35 minute pilot is included in this collection by Image Entertainment.Anyway, I'm just trying to help. I thought some of you might like to know this stuff."
5,Good Value in the end.,"To the poster who is complaining about price, considering there are 36 30 min. episodes I think this is good value. Also the fact that ""this edition has been mastered from new 1080p film transfers using the original camera negatives and magnetic soundtracks (rather than recycling the HD masters they already had on hand from the 2004 Definitive DVD Collection"". 36 30 min. episodes equates to 18 hours of entertainment. Divide that by 2 hours(average time per film) and you end up with 9 ""films"". Multiply that figure by the average cost per Bluray and it returns quite favorably. Each to their own in the end I know. My own complaint is that rather ridiculous cover art not befitting this brilliant TV program."
4,Why 4 and not 5 stars?,"Of course a Twilight Zone fan, but I gave this manufacturer only 4 because they did not include an option to play all episodes - you must manually go back to the main menu and select the next episode to view.You would think with the decades of Twilight Zone marathons the manufacturer would have enabled the buyer to have the option to watch ""marathon style"" - but they chose not to."
2,Great Set but,"Wonderful set, but Disc 4 doesn't work for me either (except in my Playstation 3). The picture quality is awesome."
1,Another recipient of unplayable discs,"After reading reviews of those who received unplayable discs, I guess I should have known better, but I couldn't resist the temptation to purchase the set given that I am a big fan of the original Twilight Zone. I'm now awaiting a third replacement set, searching for that elusive set that will actually play. Here's to hoping."
5,A Timeless and Iconic SciFi TV series,The picture and audio quality of all the episodes is outstanding! I loved this series ever since it debuted in 1959
5,The best,They don't make them like they used to. This is one of the greatest series that was ever brought to t.v. Highly recommended.
4,nice grape handles,My wife and I are into wine and this is a great addirtion to our kitchen cabinets
5,One out of two,Great movie Return of topper I stres the word movie one only within my order still it was great fun I would not order of this seller again as only half the stated films were inclosed however double the laughs from this than most other films
5,Classic movie,"I used to watch this movie with my mom when I was little and now I watched with my daughter. It is a wonderful old movie with Mr. Carey Grant who is a favorite actor of mine. The DVD was in great shape, arrived in a timely manner and well worth every cent."
3,Topper 2 pack,"I have always liked the Topper movies and series so it was great to get the 2 pack of movies. Needless to say - both movies are classic greats and I enjoyed them both story-wise, however, the video quality of ""Topper Returns"" was extremely poor. Looks like it was transferred to DVD from a well worn-out video tape. No signs of improvement to the video quality. I would expect a much clearer image from the DVD. On the Bright side ""Topper"" was very clear and clean. I would give ""Topper"" 5 stars and ""Returns"" 2 stars (for poor image) Hence the 3 star rating overall."
4,Oldie Fans,Topper is a great classic Cary Grant Movie. It's quite old so it's slower paced than today's movies but great none the less.
2,Topper and Topper Returns,"A sad reminder that fond memories of movies gone by should be left alone. Topper was long and slow and mildly amusing. Topper Returns was an embarrassment to watch. Poor Rochester was forced into the only kind of roles that African Americans were allowed to play, and the other actors did not fare much better with that lame attempt to play on the success of the original movie."
1,Mislabelled,"Picture quality and sound are excellent, but the product lacks the closed-captioning listed both on amazon and the packaging."
4,nostalgic comedy,"Enjoyable, but not rip roaring humorous. I think it was more driven about showing off its then new technology than the script. It was fun, and I enjoyed the old fashioned humor. The fun enjoyed by the Kirbys seemed to be exclusively boozing. It could have been a great movie with a better script and directing. Constance Bennett and Cary Grant were great and Roland Young and Billie Burke were fine additions."
1,Topper great Topper Returns strange This DVD Horrible,"Please buy a different version of these two movies. The 2010 reprint by Big D is horrible. The first movie shuddered throughout and the second froze after 42 minutes. Both were poor prints.Topper is top rate screwball comedy with Cary Grant and Constance Bennett; while Topper Returns is a mix of screwball, Draculaesque scenery and elements of film noir mystery. Topper returns features Joan Blondell, Carole Landis with Roland Young and Billy Burke returning from Topper.Again, buy the movies, but buy from a more reliable company."
3,Image problems,"I've read the reviews here praising the transfer of topper, and I'm not sure why my experience differs so greatly - I watch my films on a computer, which may have impacted it - but the closed captioning turned on and off erattically and in an uncontrollable manner, slowing up the data stream from the DVD and making it choppy. The image itself was clearly fuzzy with age and missing or brutalized frames weren't massaged digitally at all, as far as I could tell. Ten dollars isn't too much to pay for my favorite Cary Grant comedy, by any means, and I'm glad I have it, but when I get my home entertainment center in order, I surely hope to find these reviews to be true, because my experience with this disk was that it was as sloppy as many of those Image DVD's that came out right after the format was invented, and I felt it was misleading to release this disk with the gold banners and all the marketing trappings of some kind of special edition, when so much was messy."
1,Not a recommended buy for Xti Users,"Even though in its description, it claims to be compatible with Rebel Xti. After opening the package and setting my Xti to self timer/remote, I clicked the button and nothing happened.....I called tech support and apparently it works with only ""some"" XTis. They're sending me a new Canon RC1 remote for the $10 difference.If you own an Xti, I recommend spending the extra $10 and getting one that you know will work."
3,Opteka RC-7 Review,"Pro:Small, easy to use.Con:Seems less sensitive, sometimes does not work. I think I may hold it in a signal dead zone. I had to swing around to find the right spot, then it'll work OK."
2,"It works, but","This product did work on my Rebel XTi, but if I had to do it over again, I would spend a little more money to get a better one. I still use it today, but it doesn't work over about 10-12ft from the camera."
3,Canon XTi,"I wanted to share my experience with 47th Street Photo as I received excellent service. I purchased three items for my Canon rebel XTi (Samsonite Microfiber Deluxe Camera Bag, Opteka 1200mAh and Opteka RC-7 Wireless Remote). The only problem I had was with the Canon remote, it would not work with my Canon XTi. I emailed the support that replied back within 24hrs and suggested I try a few things to trouble shoot. After these failed the support offered to send out a replacement or pay an extra $10 for the original canon remote. I paid the extra $10 and received the new working remote within two days. I would suggest if you are looking for a remote for the Canon Rebel XTi, pay the extra $10."
1,"Does not work, bad UI","Terrible manual, terrible user interface, does not work with the camera as specified. What a piece of junk. Most importantly, the battery did not have a protective piece of plastic and so it was shipped live and now the battery is dead upon receipt. Opteka will never get another penny out of me."
1,Never worked with my Rebel XTi,"I tested with this remote extensively, and it has never worked for my XTi. I even bought another remote to replace it (a cheap (hong kong) RC-4 compatible from ebay) and that has worked fine! I bought extra batteries, swapped with the battery that came with my RC-4, and still to no avail... this remote has been $15 wasted."
1,Worthless,"No point in buying this product for your Canon EOS, it pretty much doesnt work with any of them."
4,Jimmy Neutron-pretty good,"I liked it, it had very good animation (not everyone can be pixar).Very entertaining,fast moving. Patrick Stewart was great as the villian. Animated space is always good. I would recommend for kids but parents should beware of two things. The peeing in the shower humor and the stupid Dad stereo-type that seems to show up in every movie now,especially kids movies. Other wise pretty good for nickalodeon."
4,My Kids Loved It,"That's probably the most important thing to consider. I took my three kids ages 5, 4, and 2 1/2. They all sat still and enjoyed it a lot. It was one of those ""can we go back again"" movies. There were a few parts where the kids got mouthy on screen and that always bothers me a little, but I didn't detect that my kids were imitating it afterward. The story moves quickly and parents won't be bothered by watching it a lot. As soon as it hits DVD, I'm getting it for my kids."
4,"My 3 yr old was rapt, and I had a good time too!","This was a cool movie - maybe just a little much for a 3 yr old, but I haveta say that my son was engrossed the entire movie; we took him to see Monsters, Inc, and Shrek and he got anstsy towards the end but this one held his attention the whole time.From my somewhat older ;) perspective I was entertained and amused by the movie as well. The animation was well done based on the style and the sound design was cool too; besides any soundtrack that has a Ramones song (Blitzkrieg Bop) PLUS the ""chicken dance"" in it works for me!"
4,Over Easy!,"CGI seems to becoming the standard. The good thing about CGI is that they take years to make and require a lot more than conventional animation. The result of this is typically far better movies than what we have been seeing lately with animated films. This is no exception. When aliens abduct their parents, the local children rely on Jimmy's big brain to help rescue them. The colors and graphics for this film are awesome. I actually enjoyed watching this with my children. Aimed for 5-10 year range, adults will find it entertaining as well."
5,Much better than Rugrats in Paris,"Jimmy neutron was a real hit on the big screen the last animated nick film Rugrats in Paris was marketed but no intrestrials were made for the film Jimmy neutron had intrestrials from ""Carl Squared"" to ""Pain Pain go away"" they were hillarious hope you buy this DVD so you can enjoy them with your family"
4,"Looked Stupid, but it's good","If you thought this was a dumb kids movie, your wrong. It's pretty funny. This movie teaches the importance of parents, but not in a corny way. It shows what could happen to you if you did anything you want without parents correcting. It even has true science facts in the movie. It has some sexual jokes that little kids cant understand, but funny for teens and adults. The pop music isn't that anoying and they still have dramatic orchestra music at the dramitic parts. Anyway, it's great for teens and kids."
4,"""I don't care how advanced that alien civilization is --""","""-- If your father and I haven't met them, they're strangers, and we don't talk to strangers.""It's a kid-safe bit of amusement, with brilliant Jimmy out to save the parents of the world. The parents have been captured by evil aliens, who look like something lurking in the back of the fridge on last month's leftovers, but with googly eyes. Jimmy and the kids of the world (or at least, his housing tract) save the parents in a bloodless coup.Wheezy Carl, snooty Cindy, and all the rest create a cast of easily recognized stereotypes. Jimmy's Mom is the one who changes the oil in the family car - cheerful but inept Dad can barely be trusted with the oil in the salad dressing.That's about as deep as it gets, though. Kids may like the ""kids save the day"" theme, but there's not much here for the adult viewer. One extra star for above-average visual humor.//wiredweird"
1,This movie is pretty stupid...,"Well, I watch Nickelodeon a lot, and they advertized Jimmy Neutron A LOT!!! I expected a pretty good Nickelodeon movie because of all that but what did I get? A BORE! I'd rather sit through 3 episodes of barney than watch 1 hour and 34 minutes of this movie. None of this movie was funny or exiting, and it's pretty unrealistic (If that isn't a word, it still fit it) Because I don't really think that Jimmy was any smarter than I AM! Thank you for your time.(I hope this review was helpful)"
5,"Good, love Jimmy Neutron","Good, I love it. Jimmy Neutron has always been a favorite, but it's not on as much I would like for kids to watch. They need to make more shows like this!"
2,Oh no!,WHAT?? This is a pathetic excuse for a movie. Poor Jimmy Neutron should invent a better movie.
1,I want my 82 minutes back,"I won free tickets to this movie when it was released in the theaters. It was so bad that my daughter and I felt that we should of been paid for our time wasted. I love animation, and my daughter has a college degree in animation. We both felt that the story and the premise of this film were stupid. I would not waste your money on this film."
1,Typical Nickelodeon drivel,"While I believe not everything my children watch has to be educational, I do need it to be bearable. This adult found this movie unbearable to watch."
1,LE FRENCHMAN,har har this movie suuuux! me whar the frenchman sais that this was the biggest load of bum poo i have ever seen im my life. CROISSANT! it was very smelly and i yelled very much at it for its dumbness. In my countreee we have ze great JERRY LOUVIS HOR HOR HOR HOR le borscht! If this movie had a wood worm named PICO sing once r twice and the story was abÜt searching the world fora FREAKING FAIRY i would think better but you AMERICHANZ think that boys with simple and egg plant shaped heads are fuuun to watch then i say get your boxers up the foxes nose n do a lil dance for me HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR PHHHT AHHH!
1,Jimmy Neutron Buy Doofus!,"The tv series is better!I don't know why kids think this movie is cool. This isn't a family film, because only kids would be interested in movies that say:Sheen: ""I'm peeing... in the shower!""[Jimmy's dad burps]Mr. Neutron: ""Well, at least it came out of the attic and not the basement.""and Cindy Vortex: ""If we get blown up, whatever's left of me is kicking your ***.""I'm glad I rented this because I don't wanna grow up to have immature bathroom-humor-loving kids!"
2,It was ok.,"The problem with some of these nick films is that if a show becomes very popular, they decide to strech it into a 90 minute movie and it only appeals to younger fans. Now spongebob, and rugrats(first one)is not the case.This film is very unrealistic and childish not to mention stupid. I don't know who the heck would want to make a movie about some stupid kid who is a genius. It doesn't make us feel for the characters in any sympathy whatsoever. The parents are extremly stupid, but not in the funny way like patrick or timmy turners parents. The characters are cliched, and the plot of this film is cliched. Lilo and Stitch is better, even though i didn't like that film. Overall, rent before you buy. Also I gave it two stars because Carolyn Lawrence is in it and she does the voice of sandy on spongebob.p.s. the show sucks crap as well!!"
4,Jimmy Neutron - Boy Genius,"Jimmy is challenged to use his big brain to solve problems; a good role lession for kids. Jimmy also seems to have unlimited engineering and manufacturing resources creating stuff out of ... nothing. This is where complete fantasy takes over and much of what is portrayed is simply bad science. Kids in space ships with open cockpits and no space suits, for example, does not add to any understanding of space for even the youngest kids. Neuton is simply cartoon entertainment with good animations with only one take home message that it is cool to be smart."
3,Good start to a reat show,"I first saw this movie on DVD. I loved it from the start! It was funny, energetic, and awesome animation. But Cindy, who in the end of the series, ends up liking Jimmy, is a pest. She is so mean to Jimmy, its not even funny! Also, Carl, Jimmy's best friend,changes his last name from originally Chuckie to Wheezer.Plus, you get to see a rare glinpse of Sheen's dad! All in all,this movie is worth watching, but not getting."
1,My 4 year old gave it the thumbs down,"My son watches movies he likes till the VCR or DVD player dies, he watched this film only twice. Although I found it entertaining, the fairest review I can give it is based on my son's response. We did not get value for money from this film."
1,"Buy ""Iron Giant"" Instead","I truly enjoy watching annimation with my kids: not just the undisputed classics like Iron Giant, Shrek and Beauty and the Beast, but even Rugrats and Hey Arnold. There is absolutely nothing about Jimmy Neutron that drew me in or amused me (except for a silly chicken dance at one point). One of the four children (ages 7 - 10) loved it. Three thought it was ok. I took a nap."
3,"Not very good, better for younger children","This movie is much better for the younger set of people. It has a few laughs but probably no one over 21 will like it that much. If you have kids Rent it for them, They should really like the movie."
2,Warm fuzzies and generalities,"One day I might want to start a business, and I wanted to get a feel of what to do. This book, however, did not provide it.This book mainly deals with generalities, and is more a definition of common sense than of how to start a business. Instead of concentrating on specifics, what forms to use, the amount of time to set it up, the cost, etc. It gives a very general, almost a ""duh"", feel to it.It's a small book, but the amount useful information presented is even smaller."
4,For the TRUE beginner.,"If generalities is what you're looking for (and I was) this book is very handy and useful if you know absolutely nothing about starting a small business. Too many other books get into too much detail assuming you have a basic knowledge already - I didn't. This book helped me get to that point so I can understand the more detailed and nitty gritty books.I wasn't crazy about chapters 1 & 2 (Why You and Why Your Own Business? & Choosing Your Business). But I found chapter 3 very useful (The Best-Laid Plans) because it explained what a Sole Proprietor is, for example, what the pros and cons are and how it compares to Partnership, Corporation, etc. And it explained it in very simple layman's terms. You can find a lot of this information free online but, again, you find WAY too much information that assumes you have a basic knowledge. I found it all too consfusing. I really liked the simplicity of this book and it assumed I knew nothing (and I didn't). But now I do! :)"
5,Good Stuff,"I have listened to a LOT of this group, and I must say that this is Clannad at their best. Though Clannad has a tendency to repeat songs on consecutive CD's, this one is refreshingly devoid of that. Croi Croga, the very first track, is among the best on the album, and Alasdair MacColla is among the best I've ever heard. Other excellent songs include Trail of Tears and From Your Heart, but there is nothing worse than ""good"" on this CD. This is truly a great from a great group."
5,A Beautiful Recovery,"After disappointing pop-albums like Sirius, Banba and Macalla, Clannad is back with more than the best of them. Maybe they just had loads of time to take the best out of the mysticism and ambiental sounds of Themes from Harry's Game and Last of the Mohicans, Na Laethe Bhi and Caislean Oir. This is an album where Celtic music and new age lovers meet. This is an album with a completely new dimension of Clannad sound. Even such pop-stuff like Bridge and Seanchas have their grace, far from being annoying like majority of other Clannad's pop-trash. This is the best album by Clannad if we exclude the early folk-albums. This is the best new age album and this is one of the best albums in general. It doesn't matter if you like such music - this album you will LOVE!"
3,"Good, not great and not their best","Strangely enough, this is not a 'best of' compilation, which Clannad seems fond of releasing. In the case of ""Lore"", an anthology would be better advised. Track two, 'Seanchas' and eight, 'Trail of Tears', rise above the rest of this CD. Clannad is good; no doubt that the Brennan/Duggan quartet is strongly gifted and talented. In particular, Maire Brennan's voice sometimes sound ethereal and beautifully other-worldly, but ""Lore"" isn't a particularly strong showcase of their collective and individual talents. ""A Magical Gathering"" would be better recommended, even though it is one of the 'best of' anthologies."
2,"So close, but so very very far","Finally Howard Jones gets rid of that lame pop-synth style so we can truly hear how great the songs he wrote were. Just Howard and a piano and a percussionist. So how on earth did the result end up sounding so cheesy? Maybe it's that over-equalized percussion that floats on top of the music instead of driving it. Maybe it's the strange digital chorus effects on the piano and vocals. Or perhaps it's because Howard, showing excessive laziness, lets his tone-deaf audience sing half of the lyrics. In any case, somehow, amazingly, it doesn't work. What a shame that such a brilliant songwriter has yet to produce a recording as sophisticated as the songs on it."
5,Redemption for pop music,"For a time, this CD was the only pop music I would listen to; the only one that held any interest for me. Live collections have the potential to the best or the worst. They can be so awful, pointing out all of an artist's flaws, or they can allow a talented artist to soar. Live Acoustic America falls in the latter category. It remains fresh and immediate after many playings."
5,Sweeeeeet,Loved the Disk From first track to last. This underrated performer really shows off his musical talent. Hear for the first time his 80's Casio keyboard sound as it should have originally been recorded. Plus other great songs that you may have not heard before like Exodus and City Song.
3,One For The Kids...,"Yes, THE WILLIES is a goofy, silly horror anthology movie. Yes, it's an extremely low budget affair w/ some godawful dialogue and acting. Still, I enjoyed it in spite of it's shortcomings. Is THE WILLIES frightening? No. Is it fun? Yes! It's the kind of movie I would have loved at 12-13 years old. Packed w/ gooshy, gross-out jokes and monsters, it's a middle-schooler's dream! The perfect movie for kids raised on GOOSEBUMPS books. Sean Astin (THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY, BORDERLAND) has a small role, and James Karen (POLTERGEIST, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD) plays a janitor w/ a horrible secret. Also, watch for cameos from Clu Gullager (RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, FEAST) as well as some familiar faces from 80s TV! Pure cheeezy fun..."
5,TC in the Zone,"This novel was written during a period when Clancy was in ""The Zone."" This novel provides the reader with a background of a character that we know from previous novels as John Clark. Clark, an ex-Navy Seal, who possesses a great deal of intelligence and ice water in his veins when confronted with evil. He shows absolutely no remorse and offers no apologies for exterminating the criminals who wreak havoc on society. This is a very dark novel with extremely graphic descriptions of gratuitous violence coupled with excessive profanity. However, the book is also a great yarn with intricate sub-plots and places the reader in the midst of the action that took place during the Viet Nam War era. What's interesting is that Jack Ryan, son of a homicide detective, makes a cameo appearance as a college senior and discusses career options with his dad.A shame that this book was never made into a movie. It would have been awesome."
2,Serial killer as a hero,"Only Clancy would make a serial killer the hero of a book. The truly sad part is how many other characters in professional positions look the other way. In the past, I have enjoyed Clancy's works. This one went over the limits good taste. I added the second star because like many Clancy works it is well written. I did finish it. Readers should be cautioned that it is a disturbing concept. In the real world, this hero would be seen as an evil villian of Manson or Gacy dimensions.I will admit a personal bias. I am a strong supporter and advocate of local police departments."
1,Clancy's worst,"Clancy should stick with the techno stuff. His attempt to show the more human side of his characters flops. Kelly, and every other character, is one-dimensional. It is simply too trite that a man could fall instantly in love with a hitchhiker, without our having any hint of what he really sees in her, then spend the rest of the book obsessed with avenging her death. Not that the guys didn't deserve it, mind you. He does play with the gray areas of justifiable actions outside the law, kind of a human super-hero vigilante for whom police are probably grateful behind closed doors. But this book has the literary depth of your average Sergeant Fury comic book."
2,A last good one,"This is not one of his best, but considering what manure or tree wasters he has written, this is almost good. I have stopped reading this author, he seems to get paid by the word and in later books puts in subplots that have nothing to do with the book so he can make political or religious statements.Buy this book second hand, and keep it handy for a camping trip. It will give you something to read on rainy days and will give you a nice supply of toilet paper."
4,Mr. Clark,"This book answers the question of ""Where did Mr. Clark come from"". I always thought he was almost as interesting as Jack Ryan. He is."
5,Fantastic,"If you like Clancy, then you will love Without Remorse. This is truly one of my favorite books of all time. I was a huge fan of Rainbow Six so this book was an easy read for me. Those who gave this book negative reviews obviously don't like Tom Clancy. I have read nearly everyone of his books and this one sits amongst the top. If you did not like books like Rainbow six or Teeth of the Tiger, then this book is probably not a good one for you. However, If you loved those 2 books, then prepare to have a new favorite!!!"
4,Enjoyable,"Not Clancy's finest work, but eventually became a gripping page-turner for me. I guess it took me a while to get into the story because I kept thinking that the background story of Clark just didn't need to be told. But... once I got past that hurdle and the overly quick development of the love interest between John and Pam, I really got immersed in the story and the parallels Clancy was drawing between the foreign war and the casaulties of the hidden war still raging on American soil in our inner cities.I knocked a star off for the gratuitous insertion of the Ryan family into the story. I mean, come on!"
4,Classic Clancy,"I am a bit Clancy fan and have read all of his recent stuff. It was great to read one of his first novels. Many of his recurring characters were introduced here and it was interesting to see John (Kelly) Clark as a young man just starting out. Clancy's writing has certainly matured over the years, but this was a great, exciting read."
5,Great Book,"This has been such a fun book. So interesting to hear the back story or John Clark, aka. John Kelley"
4,A great story,"This story focuses on John Clark, a change from the usually Jack Ryan stories. Clark is shown in the gritty special ops world that we always new he had in him. Clancy takes Clark and fleshes him out in ways that he was never able to do in previous novels. This story is not a ""political thriller"" the way that Jack Ryans stories might be called, this is an action story. When you read this hold on for a great action filled twisty-turvey ride."
