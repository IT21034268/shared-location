2,Not all that helpful,"I was hoping this book would have more to offer. Its a fun read to look at all the various travel locations, but it didn't offer much at all in terms of helpful advice. It's more like a travel book than anything else and it actually caters more to readers in a high income bracket than to the average bride looking to plan a wedding her guests could reasonably attend."
4,wonderful Lazy Susan,"Wonderful quality,sturdy,looks wonderful,rotates wonderfully,just wonderful!!!! I ordered it on 4/19/08 and it arrived 4/22/08! I have no complaints! Kudos to Lipper!!! and Kudos to ""Organize-It"" for their timely attention to my order! I'll be sure to recommend this to my friends!"
2,"Lipper Beechwood Lazy Susan, 13 inch","The problem for me with this beautiful beechwood lazy susan was this: No edge around the perimeter to keep the various condiments, etc from sliding off."
2,"I get the idea, but...","this goes with my review of the book. It is kinda corny. I see an author making money off of spirituality maybe not in the best way. If you want to be into Ted Andrews' way of animal wisdom, this will get you there. If you are looking for something more, then this isn't it. It is a starting point."
5,"Vigorous, entertaining performances","I have a number of performances of both symphony No. 94 and 96. Hogwood's is quite competitive with the best in 94 (Szell) and 96 (Szell and Abbado.)Hogwood provides vigorous earthy performances and the recorded sound is clear and vivid. The keyboard continuo is audible at times but not objectionable to me. Both Szell and Abbado are more elegant but Hogwood is more vigorous.I'd recommend this as a first purchase of the symphonies or as an additional (but I'd recommend the Essential Classics with Szell conducting 92,94 and 96 even more strongly.)Haydn: Symphonies Nos. 92, 94 & 96"
2,Building Websites Using DotNetNuke,"Not very helpful for developers. This book is really a book for people using DotNetNuke from an administrative perspective. The module building chapter does not have a good example. I received better examples from the free module building tutorial on the DotNetNuke website. This book was suppose to be for developers or administrators (actually I bought for this reason). However, most the information for module building was not very helpful. I would recommend this book for administrators and beginnings looking to administer a website who do not know how to program or build data models."
4,Good book about DNN,I bought this book and the WROX DNN book. I like this one better. Especially the chapters on programming your own custom modules and deploying your apps. Invaluable.
5,Beautiful Notebook!,"I love my new notebook! It's a great price for the product you are getting. Just make sure to purchase two (2) 1 GB memory modules in order to make it run more efficiently. The way the notebook comes, it has two (2) 512 MB memory modules and there are only 2 slots. It is suggested that since it runs on Windows Vista Premium, that it would work best with 2 GB RAM."
1,Save your money!,"I own this model and wish I had purchased a MacBook instead. My unit was shipped with Vista (which crashes all the time) I contacted Toshiba about a disk to ""upgrade"" it back down to XP and was shocked to learn that they can't help me as they didn't make the software so I should contact Microsoft (who told me to call Toshiba) with Vista problems. Nice! So unless you like LOTS OF PROBLEMS with NO SUPPORT don't waste your hard earned money on anything running Vista. After so many lock ups and a few total restores, I gave up and purchased an IMac. WOW! I wish I had done this years ago. I'll be happy to purchase another Toshiba when they ship it with the Mac OS."
2,not enough,"good filling, fast shipping, but there weren't enough of the little pellets to fill a regular sized bean bag chair, i'll either have to get 2 more bags or use another kind of filling."
2,Where's the beans??,"This shipment came very quickly, but not enough beans to fill a normal bean bag. They should let you know that it's not going to fill it. I am NOT going to order more because the shipping was quite high."
3,bean bag fill,"The product did what I needed it to do. The quality of the fill was average, but it did the job."
3,"not a lot of fill, but it is what it advertises","I had a partially deflated beanbag chair, and the amount of fill that came did not fill it back up enough, so I need to buy a second batch. It really isn't that much, but it is cost competitive with other stuff that's out there on the internet."
1,packing peanuts not beanbag filler,"This is easily the worst item i've gotten through amazon. it's not beanbag filler, it's little round packing peanuts. they don't roll around like they should, they just compress. it's impossible to return so i have to start over. do not buy these. i would give zero stars if i could but they force you to give at least one!"
3,foam review,"The item shipped very fast. However, I was very disappointed in the product. It was full of static which made stuffing anything almost impossible. It was very messy and there were a lot of large pieces (junk) mixed in that looked like packing peanuts. This stuff was pretty expensive and I threw a lot of it away. I would never buy this again."
2,small,As some reviewers notes -- the quantity is small. I wish I trusted the previous reviewers more. Way too expensive for what you get.
3,for PHD only,"This book is for master , PHD or higher. Lots of graduate school physics, math. Researcher, scientest engineering grad. school student may find it useful for studying light emmiting semiconductor material. I was a electrical engineer myself. I am tring to find practical applications of LED and LED products design technics find this book not very useful."
3,Make sure it's the right edition!,I just bought one of these through Amazon and it turned out to be the 1st (2003) edition instead of the 2nd (2006). The Amazon ordering system doesn't seem to distinguish between them so make sure you get the right one. There are substantial differences!
3,Good book for some one studying the physics of LED,Good book for some one studying the physics of LED. Not really suitable for the average engineer working with LED applications. Well referenced chapters good for study and LED research.
4,Poor Customer Service,The product itself is ok. I had a problem with an order and the company was completely unresponsive. They didn't return phone calls or emails.As long as everything you order is ok then fine. If you have an issue then don't depend on Bayou Classic fixing it. This is a ma and pop outfit and they don't have the resources to handle the volume of business they are doing.Buyer beware!
5,Excellent burner,I bought this burner over the black painted one to avoid having the paint burn off. It works well from a low flame all the way up to full blast. You do need to take care to adjust the choke so you get a good blue flame and to much gas will cause the flame to blow itself out but it can bring 14 gallons of wort to boil quickly.Great product.
5,Bayou Classic,Great product! As described. The quality is great at fair price considering it is stainless steel. No reason to buy anything else. Shipping was quick with no delays.
2,E-file Fee - beware,"I know this was already mentioned, but there is an e-file fee of $29.95. I was going to go ahead and do this anyway even though I vowed not to buy it again because e-filing is the reason I bought it and now they are charging for it. So I continued on. It isn't only $29.95 they would charge, there was an aditional $29.90. Almost $60 extra just to file electronicaly. So, regardless, the only benefit this program seemed to offer was down the drain."
4,2005 Amended Fed Tax Return,"I recently had to file an amended Federal Income Tax Return for 2005. Although not as sophisticated as later versions, the 2005 version of TurboTax got the job done relatively simply and quickly. I would purchase another year's version without hesitation, if I needed to do another amended return."
1,Never again,"I've been using TurboTax for years, and have finally had enough.Beyond the high price, the lack of rebates now (Intuit has removed this ""hassle"" and instead pockets more money), the useless ""ItsDeductible"" program (told me my used underwear would be worth $1 each in donation--this is simply ridiculous and should be criminal) plus the useless Gift Card promotion (shipping only 14.95!), the program contains errors and did not allow editing a form to correct it. After many years of TurboTax development, this is simply unexcusable.I'm going with Tax Act or anything besides TurboTax next year. I'd give this program zero stars if possible."
2,I Feel Ripped Off!,"We also have used Turbotax for the past 8+ years with good success; we like the ease of doing it at home, on a Sunday or whenever we can fit it in. But it ended up costing more than going to a professional this year. Yup, you pay the $ for the program, then the $ filing fee (friends have since told me that there's a link on the IRS site to file for free), then some bank in California gets a $ handling fee!! Last year we got our return deposited in 4 days. This year the ""bank"" emailed us stating it would take 2+weeks for them to receive the return and send it on to us. Makes me wonder why it takes so much longer for them to ""handle"" my return, and maybe how much they made on my money while they handled it before depositing it into my bank (which they did, to the exact predicted date - 2 weeks after filing). At least we can write off the fees next year. So, save yourselves the $$ and go elsewhere. We will next year."
1,will not import data from Tax Cut,"Since Tax Cut decided not to produce a Mac version this year, I got stuck with Turbo Tax. Their website promises that one may import data from the previous year's Tax Cut return. Then you buy the thing, and you find out that it requires you to load the Turbo Tax program and your 2004 Tax Cut data onto a Windows machine, transfer there, then load it back onto the Mac for this to work. So, like a chump I borrowed a friend's windows machine and did all this. But, it doesn't work. Not at all. And it takes a lot of time to find that out. Tried every workaround I could think of. Nope. It doesn't work."
2,Lost all my data,"I've been using TurboTax for over 5 years and have always been happy with it. But this year (2005 version), the program lost ALL of my entered data when I made a duplicate of my saved file. Both files were empty except for the data that had been transferred from the previous year. I had spent 8 hours on this! I have written to them, but have not received a reply. (Mac OS 10.4.5)"
1,Beware of hidden fees for e-filing,"Turbotax offers the option of having your $29 in e-filing fees automatically deducted from your refund. What they don't fully disclose is that they and their 3rd party affiliate, Santa Barbara Bank & Trust, charge a $29.95 fee for this convenience. There is no charge for paying with credit card but this option comes up after the first and you are lead to believe that there is no fee for either. You can read more about it on TurboTax's forums. Just search for class action lawsuit, or go here http://forums.turbotax.com/intuit/board/message?board.id=5982F970&message.id=2222&page=1"
2,Don't Need to Pay a Turbo Tax!,"I've been a Turbo Tax user for many years. I thought the earlier versions of this product were great. They had video clips in the CD ROM that would explain some aspect of the Tax Law, or a description of certain allowable deductions.This year, the product was very sterile, with no videos. The program did not do a very good job of walking through the tax form, but rather relied on my previous tax return information. I had to guess what the program was asking me for, and if I entered the wrong data, I would find out 2-3 questions later, and have to back up and re-enter the data that was really being requested.While I have a tax refund due (rather sizeable), the program said that I would need to pay an estimation tax for 2006!!!I hope the IRS and the state of California do not audit me, since I am not sure that the program submitted my data properly."
5,Excellent Program,Wouldn't use any other program. E-filed both Fed & State with direct deposit. Both refunds in my account within 10 days of filing. And the total e-file fees are $14.95 for Federal and $14.95 for State. There is no additional fee for e-filing.
3,Not quite ready for prime time,"TurboTax made a few errors on my taxes this year (related to a limited partnership Sch K-1 information). TurboTax does not give you the option to edit the data directly on the tax forms. It relys upon a ""question-answer"" data input method; unfortunately, it doesn't ask all of the right questions, so there is often no way to input the correct answer."
3,Serious update problem,"TurboTax was easy to use for federal and state taxes. In order to complete the process, it required an update of the TurboTax software. On my Mac running OS X 10.3, downloading this update on line did not work, it just ran and ran. TurboTax technical help indicated another source of updates on their web page. After downloading these updates, they were not processed successfully either. I had to print the forms and mail them in, rather than file electronically. This is in direct opposition to IRS initiatives to encourage electronic filing.In my opinion, TurboTax is a flawed product, at least on a Mac."
3,Love's Labor's Lost,"Though I have been using Turbo Tax for the past 15 years, every year they get worse and worse and stingier and stingier. THe product comes out later and later. I can't understand why the state is not available until mid-February. THe coupons and incentives become less and less each year. I am fairly thoroughly disgusted though they are just about the only game in town."
4,Turbo Tax do-it-yourself tax software,"This software worked well. It was pretty straightforward and simple. The only negative would be that when it comes to questions about investments, there isn't much info. provided and some of the terms and rules were unfamiliar to us."
2,Don't waste your money...,"Wow! I just finished using this product, and I have to say that this is the worst Turbotax that I've used. If your planning on importing you W-2 information via ADP, good luck! My W-2 is printed by Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and should have been importable, but every time I would attempt to import my information all I would get was,""Response from ADP: We are unable to access your W-2 information at this time. Please enter your W-2 information manually, or try again later.""There are cheaper methods for e-file. I should have saved some coin and bought H&R; Block's tax software instead, oh well, too late for this year's return."
4,Great solution for tax preparation,It has been improved since last year version. Now you can see how much tax can be returned each time you add deductions.Cons.. no more rebate as a single purchase. You have to buy Quicken together to be eligible for rebate.
1,Do Not Bother with this product!,"Warning! Run, don't walk away from this product. Spend the money to have a certified tax accountant complete your taxes. We were audited for 2004 due to problems with Turbo Tax where it quadrupled our payment of state taxes (We typed in the correct amount)and made other crazy computation mistakes that are going to end up costing us a lot of money. Luckliy, we had doumentation of everything, etc. The IRS agent reported that she, too, had tried Turbo Tax and saw that it did not always compute properly. She says she sees a lot of audits triggered for self-employed people due to mistakes by Turbo Tax. Please don't make the same mistake we did, and trust that software will ""get it right."" It will be interesting to see if Intuit will stand by their promise to pay the Interest and Penalties we will pay for their software problems. Save yourslef a huge headache and a lot of money and hire someone to do your taxes."
5,Very Good,"I have used Turbo Tax for the last five years and this is the best one so far. Because my situation changed, I was somewhat concerned if doing my taxes this year was going to be easy or hard. Well, it was easier than I expected and I base it on using Turbo Tax."
4,TurboTax,After many dedicated years of using H&R block a friend told me to try turbo tax. It was very easy to install. It was even easier to use. The explanations helped me do a complicated tax form with ease. I started to freak out when it asked me to print forms and i did not have a printer. Guess what - you can save them as a pdf and print them anywhere. (...) Excellent all around service. Be aware that you will get charged to file electronically and for direct deposit. [...] :0)
1,**CAUTION** May destroy your MBR!!,"If you recall several years ago Intuit caught alot of flack for including DRM in TurboTax. Well, I think they're at it again...I have LILO loaded in my MBR for my dual-boot, and guess what stopped working right after I installed TurboTax? That's right, my MBR was corrupted, LILO was destroyed, and I couldn't boot into Windows.***CAUTION***If you have LILO or GRUB in your MBR, BE CAREFUL before you install this product!!!!Disclaimer: While I am not 100% sure yet it was TurboTax (I haven't run any traces on the install program), the coincidence is just too great. I install TurboTax (and no other programs), I'm asked to reboot, and DEATH."
1,E file no longer free!!!!,"If you buy this software, get ready to be cheated by TurboTax and Intuit. Plan on paying another 29.95, regardless of what you might read on the box.If you want to see some comments from past loayal customers, and now very frustrated see forums.turbotax.com. More specifically http://forums.turbotax.com/intuit/board/message?board.id=5982F970&message.id;=1509I am one of those customers. Last year of TT for me."
1,Selling an unfinished product,"I bought Turbo Tax Deluxe on 1/17/05. I started my taxes that day and guess what? I tried to deduct tuition expenses but got "" you can't compete this interview topic right now, education credit & deductions information from IRS was not final"". What has to be final? Look at a 1040 or 1040a and everything is there.I got on their chat line and was told they are waiting for IRS to send a form. Tuition and fees deduction doesn't have a form. But when they get it they will update the program.Don't waste your $ like I did, run from this rip off!"
3,Do Your Own Taxes,I got tired of paying $177 to have my taxes done so I spent 49 dollars and bought TurboTax and did them myself. Turbo Tax is a great product JUST REMEMBER TO RECHECK W2s WHERE YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE. It was my first time using TurboTax and I had to enter other incomes over becuase only one source showed up. After I re-entered the W2 information from other jobs everything turned out perfect. I bought Quicken also because I don't plan to ever pay over $15 to do my taxes. $14.95 is the fee for IRS electronic transfer which worked perfectly the FIRST TIME!!!!!!
5,Great Software for a Great Price,"I've used this product for several years, and it just keeps getting better. Saved me lots of money, too!"
4,TurboTax is the best ever.,"I really like this year's version of TurboTax. The grouping for Income , Deductions and the rest made it very easy to complete what normally is a drag to do."
4,Updates,"It was very difficult to get my updates. The message I would get said that my computer was not connected, yet I am on DSL. I received page after page of directions to change settings on my computer in order to download updates and none of them worked. It was very frustrating. Eventually, though, a change must have been made by Turbotax and I was able to update, but it was quite late in the season. I have used Turbotax many years and I always have trouble with it, however, I continue to use it because I don't have confidence that anything else is better at this time. Forget about calling their operators, that is a real bust."
2,don't bother. use online version,"if you have used the online version in the past, stick with it. buying it on disk does not allow you to import data from previous returns if done on line and you can not upload to myturbotax. almost as if two separate companies! plus the User interface on this software stinks bigtime. very hard to navigate back and forth. online version is actually better (though i didn't try it this year). does intuit actually employ programmers or watch real users? they spend far too much money on useless features like videos and not enough on simple ui issues."
3,Misleading as others have pointed out.......,"I use Turbo Tax every year and find it easy to use and quick. I was excited to see that it indicated e filing was $0.00 but when I actual went to e file it was $ (I can't remember for sure the amount) Regardless, as my taxes have become simplier, Turbotax is getting more expensive. I am going to investigate other options next year. Even if it means not importing the data. Despite the cost, the tax preparation and filing did go flawlessly.I guess it depends on the cost as a percent of your income or refund. Caveat Emptor."
2,"Using It's Deductibe, Turbo Tax deluxe, and state return",I had difficulty entering data from It's Deductible to Turbo Tax. I think the problem was when Turbo Tax asked for info for organizations on the list last year and not on the list this year - instructions were not clear. It wasn't easy to navigate to a particular page after a pause. Biggest problem - the progam did not transfer my taxable social security benefits from the federal to the state return. [...]I talked with Turbo Tax and learned an update was coming out in a few days. I lost faith in the program although it never had happened in the 5 years I have used it.
2,Updates PLEASE!,"This is the second year I have used Turbo Tax and the only reason I chose it was because it will work on my Mac OS X version 10.2.8.I made it through the entire process and now can't file because Turbo Tax doesn't have software updates from the IRS ""because of Hurricane Katrina"" according to one of their reps. The update won't be on the system until 2/17/06. I could have just filed by hand way before then.I will NEVER trust Intuit again. According to the IRS, the updates were available on 12/6/2005. Why is it taking them over 2 months to provide these updates?"
1,Terrible - buggy and poor support,"Upon the completion of my returns and after paying for the efile (which isnt free), turbotax would not submit my return, saying there was an error on a 1099 which was never input. (I've rechecked alone and with the support folks on the line.) The support people said they had no solution. And they didn't offer a refund."
2,Costs more than you think,"Beware of the E-filing costs. Previous years were moreup front costs ($ plus $ rebate). Good deal for e-filingright. That was for Federal only.This year I get $ flash on the screen just for Federal.OK, it went up. But after I e-file I see more charges froma Bank in Santa Barbara. Almost $ total withdrawn from my refund (more than the software cost) for e-filing just the Federal. I'm glad I didn't e-file the state too. I really have to check now the total as just the $ flashed on the screen.My 39 cent stamp cost is a bargain now. From now on the paperuse is back unless this changes.I like the software but Intuit must think they have customers with no minds. Saving money is a concern for customers."
1,Later For Turbo Tax,I have been a loyal Turbo Tax user for years and I loved the rebates. But because they stopped the rebates I switched to H & R Block's Tax Cut. The software costs $ less and Block rebates the Federal E-File fee. I loaded Tax Cut in with no problem and it imported all my information from Turbo Tax. I found Tax Cut easier to work with and will probably use it again next year. I filed a Federal 1040 Itemized and New York State Itemized. I would recommend Tax Cut over Turbo Tax if your filing status is similar.
3,Going downhill,"I have been using TurboTax for over ten years, and lately it has been going down hill.The user interface for the 2005 version has gotten much more confusing and I find myself wandering amongst all the screens in an attempt to find where information is supposed to be entered.Rebate incentives are getting fewer, with on-line filing rebate being eliminated this year. I guess I'll be filing by paper this year.Features that used to be in the Deluxe version are now only in the Premier version, forcing an upgrade for another $ to complete my tax return.Import from Quicken has always been poor, I have never been able to import anything other than some basic information.Just make sure you consider all this when making a purchase. It may cost more than you think."
1,My last year using Turbo Tax,"Well Intuit has finally driven the last nail in their coffin for me. I was able to weather the changes in the package that supposedly make it easier to use. I accepted their apology for the the spyware controversy they created in a previous edition.But the new policy they have implemented this year has effectively doubled the cost of their product making the competitor's offerings that much more appealing. $30 to file electronically? When the IRS offers options to file electronically for free? Intuit in year's past used an acceptable model. The first federal and state filing were free after rebate - but no longer.Sorry Intuit, I can no longer justify paying for your product. I thank you for being a leader in developing the market for tax prep software. I just wish you would want to continue being the innovative leader that you used to be."
2,Problems with istallation of product and updates are unacceptable,I've been a faithful user of TurboTax for many years. The product I recieved this year would not install the updates. I spent many hours researching the problem to no avail. I ended up with a new copy sent from their help desk when they realized the product I purchase had real problems.This is not acceptable for a product that you rely on to work out of the box. TurboTax should be showing a little more humility and inititative rather than trying to blame anti-virus software and firewalls (routers). These are a reality of today's internet that they need to master!
2,I'm getting a refund - from the store I bought TurboTax from,"The first red flag was right there on the Deluxe Edition box, where it said Schedule C/EZ. I don't want EZ. So I came to the Amazon site to read reviews, paid attention to the negative ones only, and I'm warned off by their complaints - less user-friendly, steep e-filing fees with no rebates, fees for tech support, and programmatic problems. I've used TT for 4 or 5 years and forgave them the (relatively small) problems that came along - adding ""Costs of good sold"" on a Sked C instead of subtracting them, for example. I hate product-bundling fiercely and constant pleas for upgrades, so heigh ho, heigo, it's back to the store I go."
1,Avoid at all costs!,[...]This thing does not work. I could not get it to download updates. Even tried on another computer. Still no luck. Took it back and they gave me a new disc. Tried it again and again the same trouble. Tried their online support. It is a waste of time. They refer you to their BBS. Nothing there but lots of people with the same problem. Then if it ever lets you file. [...] I can't believe they would even put it on the market with so many errors and missing forms. You get better customer service at the IRS then you do Intuit. It only gets 1 star because you can't give it a 0 that it deserves
4,"Even easier to use, Love the added features","I was VERY pleased with this year's Turbo Tax purchase. I LOVE that they added It's Deductible into the total package. Their price was very affordable for that (for those that like the TurboTax and Quicken programs). [...] The instructions are clearer than ever, the online chat help was actually pretty quick, even when I logged on during peak activity time. GREAT product. The detraction of 1 star was due to the fact that they didn't offer rebates this year for any filing fees. The price of the product was GREAT, don't get me wrong (Fed, State and It's Deductible),[...]. And yes, I know there are free filing tax softwares out there, so maybe I'll look into them. But if you don't mind spending the little bit of money (it is deductible, too) for all of the features, it's well worth it for the ease and security."
1,No more TurboTax,"After using TurboTax for 8 years, this year I will be hand filing. More and more of the the features from DELUXE have been pushed onto the PREMIER version, this costs $ more. It won't let me file enter my ESPP data into the tax forms when this has already been taxed as ordinary income and shows up on my W-2. It says, I need to upgrade to PREMIER to that.I am not taking any more gouging from Intuit and plan to file by hand!"
3,Why did you change your format Turbotax???????,"Why did they change from a previously easy to use format? Last year one could go to a ""check return for errors"" tab and it would run a program to find mistakes. This year they buried this process in a way that is hard to figure out. I realized I was lost in the program and couldn't find out what I had overlooked or how to fix it- until I finally discovered I had to go to ""show all my forms"" where they had a tiny indicator ""not done"". [...]"
3,Sour Grapes,"Now that my husband and I are retired and he is receiving social security, I decided I needed help with the income taxes that I have been doing by myself for over thirty years. I also used this program to do my daughter's taxes. The program is easy to load and fairly easy to understand. It asks questions and you just fill in the blanks. There are two problems though!1. If you stop or want to look at something else, you have to begin at the beginning, every time. This was very annoying and time consuming.2. Did not import federal tax information to my Alabama state taxes so had to do them by hand.3. The main problem I have with TURBO TAX is, after paying $30+ for the program, they want you to pay $30 more to file electronically. This was very unacceptable to me and I'll be looking for a program next year that provides both services."
1,Huge disappointment,"I have been using Turbo Tax for years, but this will be my last year. Why? Because the ""one-click update"" feature doesn't work. It crashes with a Windows general protection fault, and fails to update the Turbo Tax program with the latest tax forms. And Intuit's tech support has not been helpful at all in resolving the issue. All they can tell me to do is to try to uninstall and reinstall the program (which, by the way, doesn't work). What a waste of time and money."
1,Intuit Let Me Down,I have used TurboTax for Mac for the past several years with no problem. This year I wasted my money. The downloads won't work and the online support is useless. I have followed the directions to the letter repeatedly and still no solution. They have lost a loyal user. Don't buy this product if you use a Mac!
1,10 + year user,"I have used Turbo Tax for as long as I can remember. I have always purchased their business and their personal tax products. Generally I had been satisfied. However this year after spending much time over many months working on a complicated return, Turbo tax dumped all the data including that which was saved many times over several months. It corrupted all but 2kb of data and can't even open that. Of course you can't get a person via telephone or email.I would give them o stars if that was an option. So long Intuit."
2,Don't Bother unless your taxes are dirt-simple!,"I used TurboTax last year and liked it. This year however I needed to see how the taxes worked out in alternative scenarios, e.g. filing jointly vs. filing separately vs. head of household. The program has no provision for doing this! You have to start a new return and enter everything from scratch, plus it messed up on some simple deductions. And to get help by phone you incur a charge. Bah. Not worth the money."
3,Good tax stuff but doesn't play well with Macs and maybe Windows too,"I like the interface and like the Q and A format better than TaxCut which I used for several years. As far as taxes and IRS rules as well as a friendly interface, TurboTax is great. [...]"
5,Great way to pay taxes!,"My husband and I used an account the last couple years to figure out our somewhat complicated finances. This year though I was determined to do it myself and was able to with the help of Turbo Tax. It helped answer all my questions and walked me through the sections I wasn't quite sure of. Before submission, I doubled check this year's return against last year's and it matched pretty well. Definitely recommended!"
4,What other tax prep software would you buy?,"We all have to do our taxes. Do you want to pay some part-time ""consultant"" to do it at your expense or do you want to front the money and do it yourself? You have access to a computer, you're on Amazon for god's sake, make use of it!The product itself is fine, it does what it advertises.My only complaint is the footsie that you have to play with Intuit with regards to the rebate. Also, the free filing didn't come with the version I bought from Amazon. You would think the feds would pay ME to file electronically, saving the time and money it takes to have a meatspace puppet fondle my return. THANKS ALOT INTUIT/FEDERAL GOVERNMENT."
4,turbo tax software,Turbo Tax Deluxe is an excellent product but they should make it easier for you to back up without having to go thorugh the whole category to get to one item.Also they should make it easier to make adjustments to your state return. It's very annoying to find and adjust the State Return once you have gone back into your Federal Return.I think it is a very good product BUT they should make it much easier to navigate to other areas ESPECIALLY for the STATE RETURN.
1,Buyer Beware--No E-File Rebate with TurboTax!!,"I was dismayed to find that this year's Turbo Tax does NOT offer a rebate for one free Federal e-file. As others have pointed out, this effectively raises the price of the TurboTax by $ plus tax for a product that was already more expensive than TaxCut and other similiar products.Intuit quietly changed their ""policy"" without a lot of fanfare hoping nobody would notice. I like many others purchased the product fully expecting the reabte to be there as it has been every year since the feature was first introduced.The good news is, this finally motivated me to try H&R; Block's TaxCut Deluxe product for the first time this year. Not only was it cheaper than TurboTax, but it works just as well as TurboTax and it includes the free Federal E-File rebate that Intuit no longer offers. After 6+ years of using TurboTax, now I'm wondering what took me so long to switch."
3,Electronic Filing pulled from under our feet,"The program worked well this year with one actual glitch but generally robust. Quite a few of the selection choices in screens where options are given toward the bottom of the pages are half printed graphics and you have to guess what they say or choose wrong and guess again. I don't mean bubble items like ""next"", but bigger choices, like: Complete turbo-tax and file.The most utterly disturbing change is no credits for e-filing.To be charged over $30 for state and fed filing is corporate rape of every american household.The IRS wants e-filing to be free, but Intuit forces their hand and demands that the IRS has to let the ""free market"" prevail.When it comes to paying taxes, the IRS should be allowed to accept e-filing for no charge. This is just a case of the middleman insisting on his cut.So, if you are not too lazy, print and pay postage and save the bucks."
2,E-Filing Ridiculously priced,"I have used Turbo Tax for years and stick with it because you can import all of the previous year's info. This year may be my last because of the exorbitant price they are charging to e-file. $ for fed & state plus another $ service charge. Fine I will mail in the paperwork. Why should I pay $ to make their jobs easier? It probably saves the government a ton of money when folks file electronically and the ""service charge"" from turbo tax should be included in the price of the product. I wonder how many customers will be lost over this."
2,"Adequate, but not recommended","I have used Intuit products since 1992, and was quite satisfied until 4 years ago when Intuit began installing hidden software on users' computers in an attempt to ""stop piracy"", which caused numerous problems for us honest users who paid for the program.Secondly and even more significantly, I began noticing an apparent shift in Intuit's philosophy toward it's customers: cut back on customer support, and attempt to exploit them at every possible opportunity in order to make more money.In short, Intuit disrespects their customers.As a loyal paying customer, I will not be disrespected or taken for granted. Their level of service and support has declined. Their products constantly pimp you to spend more money on Intuit as you try to use their programs.That is why I have sworn off Intuit products when there is an alternative. Why reward someone who treats you badly?!"
5,excellent product,"i have used this product before but this is the 1st time i have purchased it from Amazon. so far this year's edition is a great product and easy to understand, Amazon great price and quick delilvery were the 2nd reason i bought this user friendly product."
1,"1st time user - very disappointed so far, but can't even finish taxes on it :(","I received this product last week, but as of 1/24/06, Turbo Tax still claimed that the education deduction/credit page is unavailable. It oversimplifies deductions while not offering useful information (like not being able to make certain deductions unless they reach 2% of your AGI). I don't feel confident in this program and plan to do my taxes by hand the old fashioned way to make sure they're right. Makes it mighty hard to finish my taxes and as for making you pay again to file, I'm of one mind - printing and mailing my return to the IRS myself b/c I don't want to give this company any more of my money. Don't buy this product!"
1,Poor Customer support,Software would not function and I could not get any help from customer support. Updates would not work nor could I file electronicly. Stay away if possible
2,TurboTax beats TaxCut for me,"For complex personal returns, TurboTax is the best. It handled the passive gain/loss situations without interfernce, whereas TaxCut stumbled & had to be overridden."
2,Product Great - Intuit Terrible,"I've used this product for a number of years and am upset with Intuit's new pricing structure - basically charging me more for the product and not offering any rebates. It's been a long, drawn-out bait and switch. Intuit's loyal TurboTax customers are likely going to remain locked in to using TurboTax since the time, labor, cost and frustration of switching products will be higher than the increased price of TurboTax and online return submittals. It is galling, and many (including me) will continue to pony up the fees, but it doesn't make me happy that my brand loyalty has been turned into servitude."
2,DID NOT meet my expectations,"Last year this product came with free e-filing and this year it was in the fine print that the e-filing charge would be in excess of $30 and additional charge for e-filing the state. I made the purchase on the assumption that, if you purchased this product, the e-filing was free. Chalk one up for the makers of Turbo Tax. I wonder how many other people spent the time entering all of their personal and tax information only to find out this very same circumstance. I for one returned my Turbo Tax product and will not buy another!!!!"
4,Taxes done,"I have always used TurboTax and would give prior years 5 stars. The format has changed this year and was a little more difficult to transition to the different areas of the tax form. Aside from that, it is a good tax program."
3,Al's review,Had a lot of problems with installation that took a long time to address. The software is nice but the transition from federal taxes to state taxes could be smoother.
1,Mac users beware,"I bought this product on the recommendation of a friend. After installing the software, i began carefully entering my information and completed my federal return. When i tried to do the state form, is when i encountered problems. First of all, i had to go to the manufacturer's website to download the updated state forms. When i tried to, it wouldn't complete the download. I tried everything and couldn't get it to work. I ended up doing my taxes myself, and when i was done, i double checked my figures because i thought i made an error. I didn't. The turbotax software is supposed to double check your file to make sure you get back as much as possible. Thankfully i didn't use it, because i would have got $900 less if i had used turbotax. My advice is to get a calculator and a pen and save yourself a headache and a good amount of time and money."
4,Lens Cap Keeper,"One of 2 brands that I bought. Both do the job but for larger SLR lenses, it is a tight fit around the barrel but still usable. Recommended though especially if you don't want to lose your lens caps and risk exposing your large and very expensive lenses and filters like Käsemann until you get a replacement."
2,typos typos typos & sloppy explanations,"There is a lot here, some of it quite advanced and quite good. But well over half the examples I looked at had errors -- typos often, or repeated chunks of text. This made the examples pretty much worthless.His prose explanations are often very unclear indeed."
5,Joe provides the most readable book on the subject,"This book is packed full of useful information and solutions but is written in an easy to read style. Having trawled through endless treacle thick SQL dirges, how nice it is to find a readable book. I recommend this book to anyone using SQL in their daily work. Don't miss it!"
3,Interesting tricks but may not quite practical,"I think the book talks about a lot of interesting tricks which are not very crucial to a developer's everyday life work. I admit that without this book I'll probably have to spend more time to figure out how to perform this or that task, but I normally have no need to perform those tasks anyway. For my work, I'll prefer reading Oracle's online manual, or those popular Oracle books. Of course I'm keeping this book in case I really need to implement some strange things in my database and I can't find out how by myself."
5,"If you know some SQL and want to learn more, this is it!","This book is not his basic volume in SQL, but his advanced volume. It helps you along explaining different issues with an excellent explanation of NULLS, their pros and their cons. It gives examples of solving problems in different SQL ways. A great buy."
3,typos wreck this potential masterpiece,"Lots of interesting ideas in this very well written book. However, ideas are where it ends, in my experience. The example code is full of typos, which makes the book less useful as a tool. For example, check out Celko algorithm 2 for median (it won't even compile).A list of corrections or a second edition are badly needed. Too bad, it has the makings of a great book."
2,"A lot of ideas, but little instruction","This book gives many tips for how to structure your databaseand about the behavior of some SQL commands (much of whichis common sense anyway), but doesnothing to help the reader actually learn the language.Examples are scarce and many of them are C code rather than SQL.I was very disappointed with this book and must continue mysearch for an SQL textbook."
1,Absolutely do not buy!,"The first pump was defective. The merchant replaced it. It also was defective. The merchant handled it excellently, quickly issuing a refund. The product (Chinese made) is lousy. Do not buy! I learned again - - - you get what you pay for."
3,1/2 Hp inline water pump,"I use the pump indoors where I need to make sure I dont get any leaks. The pump's impeller housing leaked pretty bad. I was able to pull it apart and rig a gasket, and along with a rubberized sealer I was able to make it stop. I like the pump. Its cast iron so it would break easily if dropped. But it puts out a good amount of pressure. If the thing worked out of the box I would give it 4-5 stars so far. But since it did not and delayed my project I give it 3. Fairly quiet, feels strong, good pressure."
3,Works fine - doesn't prime easy,"The vendor, Tool Planet, delivered the the pump on time and without any issues.This pump works as advertised. It takes a little more effort to get it primed than I anticipated. This is pulling water up from an underground cistern. I find the pump takes a lot of priming to get it to pull up water more than a couple of feet down.It delivers a good stream of water and works fine for watering the plants, etc."
2,Avg pump for the price,"Nice little pump but didn't last. I used it for a Koi pond outside. Once it is primed, which takes a long time, it has great pressure and volume. It pumped great for several days, then I had to turn it off for a few days, and it rusted so much inside, that It wouldn't start without a little help by turning the fan blades. The next time I shut it down, for a couple of days, and tried to restart it, it burned up. I think if this pump ran 24/7 it would be fine, although I'm not sure how long it would last because it does run a bit hot.Got a replacement for the first pump, and it ran great for about 2 months, then burned out. It is covered and out of the elements, but I think the occasional high humidity shorts out the windings. Not a good pump for ponds as advertised."
4,decent pump,Fan cover comes off rather easy but starts well and pumps fairly decent have one mounted vertical runs well no odd sounds hoping for the best
2,PUMP RUN HOT,After first start up Pump run hot after 1 hours of pumping and start smel burn.Checked the AMP an it was 1.5 Amp to high.Returned pump and got full refond.
2,Not very pleased,"I am rating this product solely on the way I received the pump. The metal tag on the top was disconnected (the rivet didn't hold), the plastic cover covering the engine was broken and the cover covering the fan kept falling off so although we never got to actually use the product in which it was intended, we wouldn't buy this product again. The company we purchased it from was GREAT to work with. They sent us a refund including shipping and sent UPS to pick up the broken one (very quickly too) so I would buy from this company again."
2,"No lift,","Based on reviews and specs I went ahead and purchased this pump. I am sorry I did. I was hoping to use it to water my garden from a shallow well, I am back to using the old hand pump. I needed to lift water 5 meters and the pump will not do that. It claims a 9 meter lift which should have tipped me off since that is the theoretical max for a suction pump. I tested it at ground level (no lift) and it worked so the pump is not broken just does not have the ability to lift water. If you need to lift water more then a few feet this pump is not for you. Now I am stuck trying to find a job it can do since the seller (not this seller) is not answering his phone or returning emails. But that might have something to do with Amazon dropping all California affiliates today."
3,cheap pump but does the job,"I've had these last 3 years, I've had these last 3 days. Its a roll of the dice when you buy one of these pumps."
2,A good idea executed poorly,"I got these to replace some terribly wore out 661 knee shins I wear BMX racing. Long story short, they're not very good. Over bare legs they twist and turn a lot, so if I was to fall they wouldn't be between my legs and the ground. And I have meaty-enough legs after years of BMXing, so it's not like I'm not giving 'em enough to bite on.Maybe over pants these's be a good deal, but with shorts, which is how I do most of my riding: No"
2,Less than stellar,"I was interested in this cd because I have heard the Academy of Ancient Music play Mozart and Haydn and have been very impressed. I wasn't so impressed by this performance. While I see the general value of using an ""authentic"" approach to Beethoven, there are often contradicting messages written on the scores of the symphonies concerning tempo. Beethoven might have written a very fast metronome marking for a piece, but also might have written ""Allegro ma non troppo"". The two messages contradict, and there are several examples of this in the Ninth. I believe Hogwood follows the metronome indications to the letter, but is this really what Beethoven wanted? At least for me Hogwood takes just about the whole symphony way too fast and what results, in my opinion, is a loss of feeling. The grandeur I associate with this piece is almost non-existent here. Incidentally the singing is quite good, but overall I was disappointed."
2,Too fast,"Okay, I admit this is a matter of taste. This symphony is simply played too fast, and I don't care how ""authentic"" or ""original"" it claims to be the drama of the work just doesn't hold together at these speeds. What is more the Academy strings sound thin. While it may be true this is how the symphony may have sounded in Beethoven's day, don't you think Beethoven would have approved of the advancements made in the sound of modern instruments? The singing is fine, but again I get the feeling the soloists feel rushed. It is exciting in moments, but as a whole it is disappointing. If you're really into authentic performances, the Charles Mackerras/Royal Liverpool Philharmonic on EMI Classics for Pleasure is better."
5,MY FAVORITE BOOK EVER,This is the best book ever!!! I've read it 7 times now and each time it gets better! It is my constant beside companion.
3,Great for low riders,"Great book if you want to lower your truck and just want to cruise, nothing about raising your truck so you can go off-roading."
2,Very hard,The pillow is very bulky and very hard... It makes it too difficult to get a good night's sleep... I tried it for just one night and then switched back to my old one...
1,Awful,"This book took me to the depths of boredom. The characters are all to typical and predictable. The story is mundane and without meaning. The author should get out of the bussiness. Although, the book does serve as a fine paperweight."
5,Love Mozart,Mozart's music is awe inspiring and is grate to listen to when studying. I played this piece on my clarinet when I was 14 and it gives me good memories of a quieter time when I was young
3,I can hear Pay's clarinet key pads sticking............,"There is no doubt this is a fine performance of both the clarinet and oboe concertos but could somebody please inform Mr. Pay (and the recording engineers, and the rest of the world for that matter) that a few of his clarinet key pads seem to be sticking. This ""key-pad-sticking"" annoys me to no end and sounds like I'm listening to a long play record that is covered with lint and dust. SNAP.....CRACKLE.....POP!!! I would have easily given this review a ""5-star"" rating if it weren't for the key-pad nuisances. I used to play B flat clarinet, bass clarinet and contra bass clarinet for ten years so I know a thing or two about clarinets."
5,Grace Chapel Inn,"If you like heart-warming reading I would suggest this book which is one of 47 in the Grace Chapel Inn Series.The foundation is that of three sisters who, after the death of their father, turn the family Victorian into a bed and breakfast. Each story involves the guests who stay at the B&B; and the sisters' lives in Acorn Hill.Their father was the minister at Grace Chapel for many years until his death at 92. The sisters, having been raised in the church, have a strong faith that helps solve concerns the guests have and with their activities in the town and with the church.I own the full series and just finished re-reading them for the third time."
2,Promises to Keep,I was disappointed in the condition of this book. It has mildew on the pages and has been wet at some point.
1,Just documentation printouts - no tutorial,"This book is several years old now, but even when it was fresh off the press it was useless. All it contains is disorganized reams of documentation that you can get off the web on the subject. No examples. No organization. I suggest you buy ""Quicktime for Java: A Developer's Notebook"". Some people think this book is too brief, but I found it to answer all of my questions. To fill in any gaps, you might consider also getting the definitive guide to Quicktime programming, ""Quicktime Toolkit"", volumes one and two, by Tim Monroe. That is more for programmers using the C language, but between the Developer's notebook and the two volume set you should be able to figure out just about anything you desire in Quicktime, including how to port what you're interested in to Java."
4,Fancy watch!,"This is an excelent and fancy watch! It looks great when wearing your suit and going to the office. No regrets on the purchase! You have to wear it everyday because its motion is based on the movement of your wirst, so if you are not wearing it saturday and sunday make sure that you move the watch at least 10 cycles per day."
5,"""A Stone Bridge North,"" by Kate Maloy","This special book is a touching story, a poignant look at all of our lives, our children, our loves, our terrible disappointments, our good and poor choices, our own growing up, well told by a master philosopher. It is joy-filled and sad, a true and honest assessment of one woman's travels from fear to confidence, from an unhappy marriage to finding her soul mate. And what a lovely story it is!In Kate Maloy's eloquent, gutsy, engaging manner, she somehow connects our lives and experiences with hers, thereby allowing us to know the thoughtfully chosen tenets by which she lives, including understanding, service, patience and tolerance.From start to finish, you will not want this rapidly moving book to end. I shall be watching for further books written by Kate Maloy."
5,Freshen Up,"I received the freshen up gum as indicated. The product arrived on time. The product looked exactly as it was advertised on your web site. There was no misleading information or advertisement at all.It is a very pleasant tasting chewing gum for my entire family. My sole reason for ordering so much is that I can save money by ordering in bulk and the ingredients in the gum are very safe. I grew up as a youngster chewing this gum. If it was good enough for me then it sure good enough for my family.I will not purchase any edible products that contain any synthetic sugars such as aspartame, nutrisweet, etc. Those ingredients are dangerous to say the least for human consumption.I am so pleased that I will be ordering once again. We will even be considering ordering other items."
4,grubedoo,"A very inspiring book that doesn't give any step-by-step, how to instructions to bettering one's religion, nor make harsh judgements of right and wrong. It is one man's stories and experiences that shape a unique and beautiful spirituality. There are lessons to be learned between the lines and insightfulness and challenges on every page but they come in the form of stories which make them delectably palatable."
4,Wonderful book great messages,Tony Campolo is a minister of great note and his book brings across the message so very well. Thank you Tony for this wonderful book
4,One of my favorites....,"I liked this book because it was very exciting, you get nervous when you read it, as you don't know what will happen next.But it all turns out with a perfect ending."
5,Earthquake Terror,"Have you ever been scared to death? Jonathan wants to go camping on his birthday. His mom twist's her ankle on a rock, then the fun slowly vanishes. When she goes to the hospital, they leave Jonathan and his sister, Abby, alone in the woods without food, water, or shelter. Can he manage to keep calm and save Abby and Moose- and stay alive himself?I think this book would be one of my favorite books.You can find out what the author is trying to say to you. It's so good, I cannot put it down. I am inspired by this book.I would choose this book then any other.You can't judge this book before you read it. So try it."
3,"Lots of action, weak in other areas.","This book is very fast paced and action packed, which is what kept me reading it. However, there are a lot of unrealistic circumstances and I just felt as though it was thrown together. It goes so fast that all that is there is action, the characters aren't built strong and rich and neither is the whole plot. I did enjoy it, but I felt that I was rushed through choppy action episodes, one right after the other."
3,Earthquake terror!!!!!!!!!,"PLot:Jonny and his sis abby lost and trying to survive when a devistating earthquake hits. they are lost for several days without food or water.Setting: In Nothern C.A. in Magpie camp ground.chareters:Jonny, Abby, mom, dad.Theme:Dont wonder off alone because u never no whats going to happen.Conflict:charecter vs. nature. there was a struggle when they were lost and the earthquike hit...conclusion:jonny an abby are found and there was a lot of damage to the campground and there mother gets treated.My opinoin of this book is boring i didnt like it because there wasnt a lot of action..."
4,A kid's review,"This story was exciting because it was adventuresome and it was really worrisome. It's like you didn't know what was going to happen next. And sometimes you think that it's not going to turn out a good story - but it did. Like sometimes it was scary, emotional, and sad - but it was really fun to read and listen to. you should tell your friends about it. I would like to read another one of these books because it was really exciting. You think some books are really boring - but this was really exciting."
4,Read this to students unfamiliar w/earthquakes.They loved it,"My 3rd graders have never experienced an earthquake, this book gave them an insight not only to the terror and fear one feels, but additonally, the magnificent size of the redwoods. I appreciated the sensitivity given to the handicapped child, and how she overcomes!"
3,fun?,"This book is more fun than anything else. Mostly, the author is wise to tell you that you could hurt yourself mostly. It also expects that you understand machining."
1,Total bunk,"Poorly written with difficult to follow instructions that involve poor techniques and designs.Possession of items described as parts in this book and/or making items described within without first obtaining permission from the Federal and State governments are felony crimes punishable by $10,000+ fines and 10+ years in prison. You can ask the author he spent years in prison himself.There are better books available if the study of this topic interests you."
4,"A Smooth, Clever Read","Ms. Elliott's mystery is a fast-paced, clever read, the sort of book to pass an afternoon or evening. The author cheerfully murders victims and leaves the details of investigation to the capable hands of her protagonist, Lieutenant Dudeck. Given Ms. Elliott's gleeful propensity for mahem (and a few loose ends, the best of which is Dudek's relationship with his partner Dani), the stage has been set for a fun mystery series."
1,Horrible sound quality,This is perhaps the worst phone I have ever owned. The sound quality is so poor the phone is useless except to notify me I am receiving a call.
4,A REAL TOOL,"I use this tool around the shop and house fairly often.This thing isn't something you just toss away so, for the price your really getting a lifetime tool.You should have one of these for just around the house stuff to save some wear and tear on the scissors.Now get in there and cut some boxes."
5,Wonderful.,"Beautiful singing for a beautiful setting of a beautiful music.I've nothing to add to other reviews, except, that this CD can be heard in Akira Kurosawa's great film, ""Rhapsody in August,"" sections of the Stabat Mater play over decaying angel statues on the site of the Nagasaki atomic bombing."
3,make money fast!,Maybe I should start an amazon store that offers things for more than 5 times the retail cost. brilliant!
4,New ideas for frazzled moms!,"This slim book was packed with good ideas for inexpensive spontaneous fun. Although some were a bit simplistic, most were new, easy and inexpensive to try! I'll give a good review to any book's ideas that keep my 4 year old busy and happy on a 4 hour plane ride, which this one did."
4,Good product,It is as advertized. I did not have any issues with AC hum. (Phono grounding is necessary with any preamp)
4,It's very nice,"This pre-amp does everything very well, but had I known the richer-sounding NAD and Cambridge Audio pre-amps are frequently available for only a little more I would've sprung for those. I'm not advocating audiophiliac tomfoolery, just stating that this competent product is exceeded by slightly more expensive products which shouldn't surprise anyone.As it stands and for its asking price, this is a great product which does a great job of bringing my vinyl to life through my stereo. Very easy to set up, VERY fast shipping, and worry-free performance from the folks at Phonopreamps.com. I would buy from them again or recommend them to friends getting into vinyl, but as for me I'll move upmarket should this preamp ever fail."
4,Great!,"When a record is pressed on vinyl, the engineer cuts the bass and increases the treble. The bass is cut so that the large, low-frequency grooves won't bump into each other, or make the playback needle jump. The narrower groove that results also allows much more music to fit. If you were to play the record straight into your audio system or computer without any correction, it would sound very bright, with no bass. Tinny, basically.The job of a phono preamp is to boost the bass, so that is back where it should be, and to cut the treble, so that it's back where it should be. In the process of cutting the previously over-boosted treble, it also happens to cut a lot of the surface noise of the vinyl. This process is what made vinyl recordings workable.The ""RIAA Curve"" is the standard amount of cutting and boosting, so that all records will sound right.This phono preamp does the job very, very well. My records sound full and lively, clear and detailed.I'm very happy I got this!"
5,Satisfied,I bought this as a better quality alternative than a standard DJ mixer for sampling records. Way better than I expected for the price.
5,Exceeded My Expectations.,"I am not an audiophile, I just needed a pre-amp to hook up my old Bang & Olufsen turntable to a receiver (without an integrated phono pre-amp) so I could play my vinyl records again. I selected the TC-750 and am very happy. The price was right, it came with a high quality cable, ground connection, was very easy to hook-up and looks great. Best of all, my old records sound better than ever. The TC-750 exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend it."
5,Works Great,"Simple to connect input, including ground, and output. Visual indicator shows power to the unit. Worked for my brother-in-law's turn-table so he ordered one as well. Best Buy wanted $200 for a turn-table pre-amp, which is more than buying a new turn-table from them."
5,Exellent item,This is what you want if your receiver does not have phono input.No noise at all. Good sound.
2,Was OK for a while,Mine started sending a wicked buzz to my speakers after about a year or so. Tried changing out all cables and different speakers. Can't get rid of the buzz unless I unplug the preamp which kind of makes it useless since I didn't exactly buy it for its looks.
1,Hummer,This product produces a hum all the time it is in use. I wrote the company and they said I could not eliminate the hum. I requested an upgrade to one of their products that would not hum. I ordered the suggested item with the understanding I could return the bad one. They refused to accept the return. They cited their FAQs which would have advised me of the hum. Their FAQs are NOT available on Amazon so I am stuck with an amp that hums constantly.
5,Great Little Pre-Amp,"My son recently bought a used turntable and needed a pre-amp to hook up to his computer. In lieu of cheaper models, I decided to check out the TC-750 based on the better tech specs for this model. We've been very pleased. We had the turntable hooked up to my receiver with integrated phono pre-amp before this arrived, and we think this sounds better. My son's not a high end audiophile, but he thinks he can tell the difference with this pre-amp, which is all that matters. Simple to set up and came with the cable needed to hook to the computer line-in. Looks good and has the ground connection for the turntable as well. I give it 5 stars not because its probably as good as some $1500 tube pre-amp (I'll never know) but for the performance and features at the price. My son is likely to upgrade the turntable some day but will make sure he can bypass any integrated pre-amp it may come with since this one may be hard to beat."
1,BUZZ is back,I've read the first comment. what a surprise BUZZ is coming back.what a great news.i wait for the reissue.what a shame for david carretta to steal a track from buzz.....easyfred
5,Weird!!,"One of my favourite albums ever! Recommended to electro,techno,and hi-nrg lovers. The whole is an amazing work of retro-futurism. It's a long time ago since this album was edited firt, since then Carreta has publishied other material also fantastic.I repeat A MUST TO HAVE for any electro-techno lover.DJ JAVI.Salamanca,Spain."
3,Multiple reading issues,"Content is very interesting, but reading is laggy, a little boring, and the e-book itself has issues. Some words glue together at small font sizes, and tables are lacking (Entry Points, Assets, etc). Needs to improve."
2,Different venue; same process,"I admit that I've enjoyed the prey series even though after a while you figure out that Lucas Davenport solves crimes by just driving around Minnesota. The big question is always will he take the Porsche or the SUV.In the author's new adventure, our new hero solves the mystery by FLYING around the country. Everywhere he goes, people just cooperate... amazing! Of course in a book that has a contempt-for-politics theme, it's interesting that our hero frequently gets folks to cooperate by promising that they'll ""be taken care of"".Go back to Minnesota, Mr. Camp."
2,Waste of time,"Don't buy this book. Wait till it shows up in the library book sales and buy it for $1. I'm taking my copy up today. Love John Sanford, love all his characters. Except these. The only time this book connects is when he discusses Wisconsin. The characters are dull. All of them. Sorry."
1,Oh dear prey we never have this character again!,Save your money. Want a good beach book? Go buy Robert Bailey's two PI books.John needs to go back to Lucus!
3,Ho Hum (yawn),"I bought this book because it was written by John Sandford, only to find it very S l o o w and it's main character, Jake Winter, a very uninteresting character. I just couldn't get into it, kept putting it down, picking it up in hopes the plot would get more interesting, to no avail. I don't care about politics or politician, they are mostly manipulators, liars and spin doctors. Perhaps he should have spent his writing time on another Kidd book, if he was tired of Lucas Davenport. All that being said, I do love John Sandford books, just not this one, and will absolutely continue reading them. I will only make sure that the next one I buy is NOT another Jake Winter story."
4,DeadWatch,I am an avid Lucas Davenport fan and was nervous if this change in characters would meet the same standards - Sandford does an excellent job! Great plot with his usual mystery and intrigue that keeps you turning the pages. Highly recommend!
1,Bring back Lucas and Kidd !!!!,"Don't get me wrong -- I adore John Sandford and would leave my husband for Lucas Davenport in a heartbeat. ""Dead Watch"" was a total disappointment -- I had to force myself to finish it after leaving it 2/3 done for 6 weeks; I wasn't drawn to any characters or the dilemma. Forensic bureaucracy?? Give me a break!!! A change from the usual is to be applauded, but hopefully this is the last we'll see of Jacob Winter."
3,Dead Watch Complicated But Taut,"Count me in with other reviewers who adore John Sandford's Prey Series and think this new batch of political characters fall a little short.That said, he's still one of the top mystery writers out there, and Dead Watch is a gripping and tight, with bits of the dry humor and a real insider perspective.The book tells a complicated story of a government researcher, or political problem solver. He winds up looking into the death of a retired politician who had a secret sex life, his estranged wife, a governor with a crazy brother and a possible motives for murder, and a president and FBI trying to stay in control and and a step ahead of the bloodthirsty media.There's almost too much going on, but Sandford manages to keep it all together.Not his best, perhaps. But so much better than most books you'll read this summer, I give it three stars and say check it out."
3,3 1/2 stars,"Though John Sandford doesn't come close to some of my favorite thriller writers, I still decided to read his latest stand alone thriller.It moved at a moderate to less than moderate pace. It was not all that suspenseful, nor was it a riveting read. It was an average thriller, from what I've always considered to be an average author, though he has a large following. As a big thriller reader I can just give this an average score."
3,Just a fairly good read. Not his best!,"Only fair. However, Sanford in not capable of writing a bad book. He doesn't quite bring a character to life like he does ""Lucas Davenport"" in The ""Prey"" Series."
1,excrutiatingly boring,"I was really disappointed in this book because I have been a loyal John Sandford reader since the first ""Prey"" book. During the best of the ""Prey"" years, I always looked forward eagerly to reading the new installments in the series. Recently even the Prey novels have been inconsistent, never matching up to the best, ""Chosen Prey"" and ""Certain Prey"", and reaching an all time low with ""Easy Prey"". However ""Dead Watch"" is the most boring John Sandford book I have ever read. After the first few chapters I lost interest--the entire story was wrapped up in the first half of the book. The rest of the book was just an exercise in drawing the story out to fit into the minimum required pages. I hope that with his next books, Mr. Sandford is back on track with interesting characters, dialogue and pacing."
2,Ah Jeez is right!,"I really wasn't going to review this book, but on a whim was browsing the other reviews when I came upon the 'Ah Jeez...' review and there I was, LOL. Seriously, I couldn't stop laughing because I believe that phrase was used about 14 times in the novel. I kept thinking about Lucas Davenport and then would have to reread the previous paragraph (wondering if Lucas would have said that).To be fair though, Mr. Sanford I'm sure would love to paint another scene or sing a new type of song...so that's what he did. Jake Winter is an interesting guy. He could have been developed a little more. But hey, thanks for the try Senor Sanford.Big takeaway: Never, ever trust a politician if they're breathing!"
1,dickle,"After reading 375 pages of ""dialogue from a bad novel"", & I have been a devoted fan of Lucas Davenport since the first chapter of Rules of Prey, I found John Sanford/Camp's latest novel painful to read. Why I didn't throw it away after the first chapter, I don't know; guess I'm still fixated on completing a task that has been started. This book was just terrible trash! Poorly constructed, containing lots of personal opinions & biases, it was really a big disappointment. The author should have never allowed it to be published; maybe he needs the money"
1,Disappointing,"I've enjoyed some of his other books, but this one's poorly plotted and poorly written. Couldn't even finish it."
3,Dead Watch,"This book is good but not up to the standards of the ""Prey"" series which I have read all of."
4,Change is good,"A new hero, a little bit of each of the old, plus new elements. Sometimes the old gets old. The new guy allows the author to express different opinions. Some are truly refreshing observations of a newsman with life experience. It was enjoyable and a welcome addition to Lucas and Kidd."
3,Average,"OK, but I wouldn't recommend. There's better, much better out there. The plot varied between believable and not, with too much ""not."""
3,Jake Winter is no Lucas Davenport,"In Dead Watch, John Sandford brings us a new realm of characters, this time with the main character being Jake Winter. An ex-soldier with a gimpy leg who works at the highest levels of the White House as a 'fixer.'There is a great, twisted plot delivered as only John Sandford can, though not quite as compelling as those from the Prey series. Sandford mixes high-political intrigue and inventive new characters to form a slow-moving plot.Good story, though not quite as driving as a Lucas Davenport novel."
3,Political enhancement,"Ok but not a ""Prey"" which is what attracted me from the first book I read. Politics are OK but I feel Mr. Sandford is way above that barrel of rotten apples. I guess the story line was fine and did all the spin and rotation that is part of that world but I prefer his other genre. I will hope he will head back in that direction soon. I love his writing."
3,"Interesting, but not plausible","The book was a good read, but I have difficulty visualizing the main character - Jake Winter - who specializes in forensic bureaucracy. Not that he isn't interesting and resourceful, but solving politically linked crimes by threatening someone's career or promising a better future to those who help, seems a bit far-fetched. Everything falls too neatly into place, especially with the good guy winning the beautiful and rich widow."
2,Difficult to Read,"Too many characters! Hard to keep track of all these people..... I've read all of Sandford's ""Prey"" books, and in my opinion this book doesn't hold a candle to those......."
4,Hope to see more of Jacob Winter!,"This is John Sandford's first foray into political thrillers, and it's thoroughly enjoyable; it has all of the intriguing, realistic touches of Sandford's other work. ""Dead Watch"" introduces a fascinating new character, Jacob Winter, who is a specialist in ""forensic bureaucracy.""This novel isn't as dense or complex as a typical Baldacci or Meltzer novel, but Sandford's plot is a little more plausible and believable that what those guys usually produce. I also appreciated that the storyline takes Winter outside the D.C. area and into the Midwest (an acknowledgement that politically important things do happen in ""flyover country"").Sandford actually had me wishing that Jacob Winter's book, ""Winter's Guide to the Inside,"" was real!"
3,Let's pray for more Prey...,"Sandford at his worst is still better than some authors at their best. If I had not been expecting something like his Prey series, I would've enjoyed this more. Not a bad read, just not up to Sandford's usual dazzle."
4,She's a Clever One,"Highly entertaining! The meeting of Laurie R. King's two characters - well, almost - since there was no Mary Russell. But we had Sherlock Holmes and Kate Martinelli: a story within a story thematically linked by intolerance and mysterious deaths. This, and her previous Mary Russell book, provide those with even a passing acquaintance of San Francisco the delight of being able to visit beloved places both as they were and as they are now. It certainly makes me want to make a quick visit. I enjoyed the author's last two books more than several others and am greatly looking forward to what comes next."
3,Maybe he is getting back to his old self,"Finally...may be getting the old John Sanford back...at least not as much harlequin romance in this, as his last several books...hoping to get the old, real Sanford back..."
4,"Great Book, a fast read.","I am a big fan of the Luca Davenport character, but even with out Lucas, this book had me from the first page until the end. I read it in one night. I highly recommend it."
2,Supreme Disappointment,"I don't read fiction; except that is for John Grisham and John Sandford. I always await each new release of both of these authors with great eagerness. That will end now for Sandford, unless he goes back to the Prey series. Those books were great - you cared about the characters, couldn't wait to see what happened next; the books were intriguing, interesting, thrilling, hard-to-put-down. Not so for Dead Watch; it is simply dead. I couldn't make myself care one iota for any of the characters in this book - not a wit. It was tedious to read; I found myself skimming, going ""ho-hum"" and waiting for the real action to begin. It never did. I never cared; I was never interested; I never found out who the killer was because I finally gave up with just a few chapters to go. I didn't care enough about the story to even skip to the end to find out ""who done it."" Please bring back Lucas Davenport."
2,Yawn a Thon,I am a big fan of John Sandford. Love the Prey novels as well as Virgil Flowers. I eagerly picked up this book to read after ripping through American Assassin by Vince Flynn in 3 days. 8 weeks and 380 pages later I finally finished it. I had a readers block trying to pick it up and wonder if the author had writer's block. I've read 400 pages of Tom Wolfe's novel in 4 days. It was a boring story that seems to go nowhere. The characters aren't explained well nor are they developed. Not worth it.
3,more than dead,Book was not what I expected from the author. Had a hard time staying with the story line. The flow of the book did not keep my interest. Actually it was a little slow and cumbersome at times. Hopefully the next one will have some guts and pizazz to it.
4,"Not the best, but still darned fine read!","Huge, huge fan of John Sandford novels. When there's a new Lucas Davenport novel out, i'm just giddy! I think this one is better than the Virgil Flowers series, but not nearly as good as Davenport. (In case you're new to Sandford novel, Flowers and Davenport are two of his three protagonists that he returns to) I'm listening to the book and the guy who reads the Sandford novels is really perfect. As other reviewers have pointed out, the many directions of the novel are a bit frenetic. But the main characters are very compelling. I enjoyed the novel overall and I just bought a copy to send to my dad, whom I have also gotten hooked on Sandford."
2,Maltese Falcon Revisited,"If you ever saw Bogie in Maltese Falcon, this book is just like the movie. There's ""a package"" that ""the girl"" even lies about and everyone is scrambling around trying to get it. Unlike the movie, the book makes little sense of the people connection/relationships making the book less interesting and hard to follow. Even if you can follow - who cares!! The characters have little or no depth. I love Sanford's Prey novels and I'll wait for the next one of them for now on."
2,A pale copy,"It seems to me that this author is trying to tell us he is tired of Lucas Davenport. I feel that he wants to transplant the best of Davenport to a new hero.If so, he failed.If that is the case, he failed. There are long stretches of boring reading and suddenly a spark of the old haro comes through to us.Worth to read if you cannot fall asleep; after some half a dozen pages, you can. How sad..."
3,"Okay, but not the best","I only bought this book because I love John Sandford, unfortunately it was not like any of his other thrillers. If you like books that bring in politics than perhaps this one is for you, but if not then you are better off leaving it unread. However, there are a few worthy twists, some interesting plot lines, and witty characters. With that being said, I would recommend reading Sandford's Prey series, which are always great; or Speak No Evil by David Demello, the suspense and murder without the politics."
2,Third time,It took me 3 starts to get through this book. It just doesn't pull you in. I was a big fan of the Prey books but they got progressively less intriguing. Maybe Sandford has run out of stories.
2,Least favorite of John Sandford,"This is my least favorite of John Sandford so far. I like the new ""hero"". I found it too politically biased. ( I understand it is in DC and is about politics) It had too many introductions to characters and I found myself wondering who people were when mentioned later. I've read all the Virgil Flowers and Lucas Davenport books so far and hundreds of others- didn't have this problem. The story line was interesting but I felt something was missing. I felt it was really sort abrupt sort of skipping around. Just my humble opinion."
4,An Entertaining Departure From The Prey Series,"While I really enjoy Sandford's ""Prey"" series of novels, I found this a very good departure from the norm. It's a very good Washington political thriller with completely believable characters. One can form an image of the characters very easily. Even the hero & heroine aren't ""over the top"" as in many novels; which is a relief. The story unfolds nicely & is very entertaining. It comes to a very good conclusion. Though, I could have done without the last two pages. None of that ""riding off into the sunset"" stuff is needed"
3,Eh...,"So the book was not in peak condition, it had half of the pages folded on the bottom right corner, and it was not delivered in a promt time. However there were no ink or pencil markings on the book."
4,Good Stories,"Each of the stories in this book are some of my favorite in the genre of African American literature. Each is engaging and interesting, appealing to the reader not only as a historical work but as a narrative and story."
1,Henry Louis Gates at his finest!,Mr. Gates is a prime example of why tenure is a scourge upon the education system in the United States. This book is a disservice to the primary sources he cites (and fails to cite correctly).
1,way too graphic,"I bought this movie for my high school class. I wanted to combine historical and cultural information with the language in my advanced Spanish classes. I started to preview it, and actually had to stop watching it. It was way too violent and graphic for anything I would watch, much less show my students. I do show R rated movies with parental permission when it seems appropriate, but I would suggest that this is beyond what would be acceptable in high school."
1,disappointing,"Very disappointing and some of the interfaces are childish, for the hefty price it doesn't appear to be any better than the myraid of free/cheap typing programs on the internet. Save your money, do some searching and find a cheaper product."
3,do not buy,The serial number provided with the software does not work. Do not buy this software.Update: Contacted the product support via email and they sent me a new Serial Number. Product works now. I am satisfied
5,Two Great Artists Together,"Jerry & Merl (or Merl & Jerry, to be fair) are really tight in the 3 Keystone CDs. The music quality is superb as well. A different take on Jerry Garcia. I bought all 3 and I am glad I did."
2,New? Not Sure,"I am still not sure if the battery I received was new. It said that it was new, but it came in a plastic bag and not vendor packaging. The battery does not hold a charge like a new battery. It runs down even when I don't use the phone."
1,Cell Tech = Rip Off,"Got the battery on time but it was almost as bad as my old one. It was supposed to be new but it would not charge at all. Tried calling Cell Tech numerous times. They NEVER answered but one of the times I tried to call, I got an answering machine that was too full to take my message. DO NOT TRADE WITH CELL TECH!!! THEY ARE HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!! :("
1,duped,"In good faith I ordered a Nokia BL-5C cellular battery.I received a generic battery, too thick to fit in my phone.Very disappointed.The ad should have said a generic would be sent. I feel very mislead."
2,Battery Almost Weak as Old One,"This new battery was probably on the shelf for years. It might be 10% better then the battery I disposed of - but it won't hold a charge for 12 hours (without use) and if I use it, the battery is dead pretty quickly. Although it was new and appeared to be in the factory wrapper, I am assuming it was purchased by the distributor long ago, and they have a back-log of old batteries in which their useful life is long gone."
2,"good price, but doesn't last very long","I had bought 2 of these battery because my was totally dead and wouldn't charge any more. I have use i battery for about 2 months now, but i have to charge it every night. The battery life doesn't last long. its a good thing i got 2 because when this one dies i will have another to last me until christmas and thats when i can finally upgrade my phone and be rid of it. I have a nokia 6555 and have had it for 2 years and can't upgrad until this december 2009. But it lasted for 1 year really well. But this year everything is messing up on it exspecially the ear phone piece in the phone. It doesn't work anymore i have to have my speaker phone on to hear anyone on my phone when they call."
2,No Hold!,I got this battery with a Nokia phone. I have to charge it everyday even though I use the phone less than an hour each day. I received a replacement and it's no better.If you can use any other battery for your device do it.
3,inefficient charge,Two to four min. of conversing uses 15 to 25% of a charge. Either does'nt charge fully or is not a new battery as claimed.Will have to do for a while. Guess I got what I paid for.
3,Too early to tell,"At this point I'm not sure if it's a phone problem or a battery problem but no matter how long the battery charges it never says ""full"" as other batteries have."
4,Works just fine,The price I paid for this battery on Amazon is far better than any local store. The local stores wanted any where from $40 to $65 for the same battery. Highway robbery!!! So far this battery has worked just fine for me and at a fraction of the price.It shipped in just a couple of days instead of 10 to 13 like I was told to expect. What a deal!!!!
3,Worth the mney,"For what it cost, it's absolutely worth it. The unfortunate thing is the device I used it with doesn't tell me when it's fully charged."
2,"""Sevillanas"" Disappointing","In a long life I have seen many of the great flamenco stars -- La Argentinita, Escudero, Amaya, et al -- and all of the Carlos Saura films, so I looked forward to having ""Sevillanas"". Alas, I am sadly disappointed. Surely there are better dancers in Spain than those presented here. The photography is fussy, pretentious, and intrudes on the dancing. Perhaps an entire film devoted to the Sevillian style is bound to lack the tension and excitement we associate with flamenco. I found it boring, and regret having bought it."
3,A Feisty Little Pointing Dog: A Celebration of the Brittany,A bunch of short stories by Brittany owners sharing their experiences afield with this great breed. Nothing in any way pertaining to the training of a Brittany. A good read for those looking for a quick story. Sadly many stories start with how the authors own dog died.
3,It's OK,It's OK. similar hunting stories throughout the book. Wish there was more about the everyday life of a Brittany. Not much else to say
5,Good Game!,"Excellent condition got here in good time too, I will definitely buy from these guy again :D"
5,Find out what animals think of us,"Buffalo Jake is a bitter-sweet story that is nothing like Animal Farm. Animal Farm makes you hate people when you see animals behave LIKE us. Buffalo Jake makes you like animals for the ways they are DIFFERENT from us. As for people, seems that the only thing that puts us ahead, really, is language. The book imagines a world, where all living creatures can talk to each other and take care of the world together. When one arrogant species thinks itself omnipotent and above the rest, it just make no sense! Are we about to learn a lesson?"
3,Great product to try,I tried A Bomb for one month and still using it. I notice a big change in my body. I'm not so sored the next day after a hard workout at the gym. Recovery time is great and that makes me work out harder. I have seen alot of difinition and a harder body.
5,Solid filter,"Fram, what more can I say about the company that makes great filters for all autos and bikes. great. great"
2,Sizing sucks,"This said it was for sizes 7-10, my 8 year old drowned in it and was very upset and disappointed."
1,Useless,"This product did not work at all. I sprinkled it all over my squash plants repeatedly after a woodchuck got into them. The woodchuck continued eating the plants, even with the shake away powder all over them. Instead of repelling, I think it actually made the leaves taste better. My squash plants are completely gone. Don't waste your money on this product."
3,Shake Away for Squirrels,This product worked pretty well for a time but our squirrels seemed to get used to it and kept coming back even though I kept applying the product. The squirrels got so they would just walk right over the area where I had applied the product. I don't think it's a bad product - I think we just have determined squirrels!
2,Didn't work,"So I'm doing work in my backyard and dug a bunch of trenches. There is a lot of soft dirt that is piled along the top of the trench now. The cat from two houses away now thinks this is the best place crap in the neighborhood, lotsa soft dirt right.So I bought this product and sprinkled some of it out on the dirt, hoping it would be that easy. I noticed that a little bit didn't stop the cat. So I used the entire bottle for an area about ten feet long. This stuff does smell like some type of animal urine. Next day, I see the damn cat pawing at the dirt trying to cover what it just left me. This might work for animals that know what a predator's urine smells like, but my neighbor's cat has no idea so the crapping continues.Maybe two stars is a bed eval because I tried it on a cat and not a ""Small Critter"", but to say the least it didn't work for me."
1,Don't waste your money,"Bottom line, the chipmunks play in it. They roll around in it like it's the first snowfall. The squirrels simply hop over it. The rabbits don't seem to take any notice of it at all. Nor do any of the deer (in fairness, the deer repellent is supposed to be coyote urine). So, which animals is it supposed to repel? It's unsightly, it stinks, it's really expensive and it does not work. If there is an animal that is actually frightened away from your plants by this stuff, I can assure that animal does not live in Ohio. Here, if they notice it at all, it's just something white and powdery that they like to roll in. It would seem to be chipmunks find it a very compelling perfume."
1,Cats love this stuff,"Neighbor across the street lets his two cats run in my front yard. Sprinkled a 20oz can of Shake Away around my front perimeter. Cats came across, sniffed it, sat in it, then spent twice as much time walking around my yard. Had no effect on them what so ever."
1,Squirrel dessert,"I sprinkled this stuff on my hibiscus, virtually layering each bud with it, and the squirrels took to them like kids slurping chocolate sundaes. And the ""money-back guarantee"" web link on the container produces no discernible routes to a refund. A very disappointing product."
3,"Works for Groundhogs, thus far...","Our little farm has chubby, hungry groundhogs galore, and so far the product works well at repelling this type of critter. My tender sprouts in the veg garden have survived the feast of the groundhogs, I'm happy to report! I can't vouch for effectiveness on other species, though.However, the 20oz granular product does not go a long way. A 70 foot perimeter application (of a fenced-in garden) requires more than half the container. Amazon's price is excellent. But, the manufacturer could do well to provide a bulk package. A smaller garden would benefit better."
3,tulips unbothered by squirrels,"I used Shake Away to keep the squirrels from eating my tulips and it worked. Last year, without Shake Away, the squirrels ate the tulips as soon as they bloomed. It also seems to be discouraging the local cats from visiting - an added bonus."
1,Shake Away - Does not work !,"I ran to the store to get this after also ordering it on line. This product is a waste of money. I thought it was going to work, but this morning, the squirrels, and chipmunks are back. The squirrels are still under the feeder standing right where the Shake Away was sprinkled. I wish I could cancel the other order. I am so angry at all the false hype about this product. The chipmunks stood right on the product !!! Now I am out of money, and still loaded .... with chipmunks and squirrels.!!:-("
3,Skunk Away,"I bought this stuff because the neighborhood skunks were tearing up my veggie garden boxes. I sprinkled the stuff liberally around the site. Within two days they were back. They have been back at least twice....but I must say...the problem is lessening. The holes are no where as bad as they were and they seem to be lessening. At this point, I think the stuff worked for me. I hope it keeps working because it took me a while and several clothes washes to solve the problems using the first method. (Don't ask....)"
1,Total Garbage,This product has absolutely no effect whatsoever. I have nappy skunks penetrating my premises and those little bastages don't give a rat's about fox piss.
2,Didn't work on a 'city groundhog' but may in the wild?,"Had a groundhog raiding my bird feeder. This is in the city so he may not really have the fear of foxes. It has a strong smell so don't get it on you're clothing or step on the granulas or you'll be stinking all day.Outdoors I had to get very close to notice the odor but not indoors.My 'hog' always approaches my patio from the same areas and I watched him as he crawled across and through the grains ignoring them. I just don't think he's fearful of a fox and he certainly isn't of people.May be fine for others or on a farm or more rural setting but didn't work for me other than smelling up the bottom of my shoes (yes, I walked in it).Hate to rate this a 2 stars because it may work in another setting..."
1,Shake Away doesn't scare MY bunnies & woodchucks,"Unfortunately my bunnies and woodchucks are not intimidated by Shake Away. I had high hopes for this product but the critters are not fooled. I put it on three times the first week, two times the second week and third week and once a week since. They are still eating my zucchini plants and my beautiful cantalope. They also have an occassional nibble on my cucumbers as well. I wish I could say this worked for me but it does not. I think I will call to see if they will honor the refund."
1,Do not waste your money,This product does not work. It does smell horrible. The squirrels still ate my Eggplant. It does not keep them from the garden. They were sitting right inside the planter. Don't waste your money. It does not work.
3,Shake Away review,This product is ok. It smells terrible and our ground hog is still here. He doesn't stay in our yard quite as much now. In ou neighbors instead.
1,I would have chosen 0 stars...,"I would have chosen 0 stars, but that was not an option. I applied the product as directed numerous times, and after rainfall, to stop squirrels from stealing my peaches. I have lost appx 20 peaches since! This product also says it will repell cats, but my cat sniffs it and then sits down where I have sprinkled it. This product is a waste of money and time. I'd be better off sitting on my porch with a rifle as they climb up my tree..."
5,It Works,This repellent works as described. I live in a townhouse and my neighbors had squirrels get into their attic and they didn't address them immediately. They chewed a hole from the neighbors attic in to my attic. Trappig didn't work neither did moth balls as a repellent. One application of Shake Away and no more squirrels in my attic. Neighbor has since been able to get rid of the sqirrels.
2,I Doubt This Works,"I don't think this works, but I haven't extensively tested it. I bought this product initially to keep the squirrels from eating my just emerged lillies, but I think chicken wire/cage is probably a better (yet physical) barrier to keep the critters away. Chicken wire is at least a better investment, although an ugly one."
1,wrong product shipped,I was shipped the wrong product and now must go through the hassle of returning it. It took a long time to arrive.
2,Disappointed,Bought product to keep Chipmonks away.No sign that it had any effect at all. Chipmonks enter area surrounded by this product as if it did not exist.Waste of money!
1,utterly useless,"You'd think since the animal I was trying to rid myself of was not just listed on the site but ON THE CONTAINER, that it would work. This product had absolutely no effect on the woodchuck digging holes in my backyard. I double checked the directions and applied several times, and yet the holes I keep filling in keep reappearing. How can you get away with selling a product like this that just plain doesn't do what it says? DON'T BUY!"
1,Disapointed,I am disappointed that Shake Away repellent didn't repel the ground hogs. The ground hogs have been digging under my foundation into a crawl space. I followed the instructions completely. Used a number of trays of the repellent in the crawl space as well as sprinkling the granules around the around the outside where they borrowed in. The ground hogs even dug through a pile of the granules to get in.
1,Won't Work,If chipmunks have moved in to your landscape...this will not move them out. It may work as a deterrent if you use it before they move in.
1,Dose not work,When I got this I put it down and two minute's The chipmunk was on myDeck like if I never put anything down.! Wast of money!
1,Shake away...yes...your money,"I wanted to plant the raspberry in my garden and to protect it from squirrels I decided to buy this thing. The raspberry had some leaves already when I transplanted it outside and there was a hope that I can get some fruits even! In two days although I put this powder on the ground around the raspberry, no leaves were there! This just doesn't work! Stupid squirrels."
2,Not working,"I have a problem with a pack of racoons that come after dark to get the catfood we have on the porch. Yes, I know - first step - take the catfood in at night - which we have started to do.I sprinkled the Shake Away around and near the steps to the porch. I haven't seen the pack but one racoon doesn't seem to be impressed. He keeps coming every night and is ticked off there is no catfood ( left a large pile in one of the empty cat bowls). Also left droppings on top of the repellent in one spot.Maybe he or she is just fearless."
2,Did not work for me...,"Unfortunately, this product did not work for me. It smelled terrible and it should have repelled the animals, but the rabbits were determined to get in my garden this year. The seller, however, was great to work with and very helpful.I guess it's worth a shot because it does work for some people, but for me - it didn't work."
2,"Was the book inspired by ""A Perfect Storm""?","After the wonderful evocative North Carolina descriptions in Early from the Dance and Ruin Creek, this book comes across as a generic. Instead of something different and distinctive, this book reads like ""A Perfect Storm"" transported to the Outer Banks. I wished that the protagonists would grow up - they weren't kids, and all that education failed them and rendered them immobile when it came to dealing with their own lives. So much self-consciousness - how do they manage to fill out their tax returns?"
1,Divergent Opinion,"I found this book unbearable, but stayed with it to the end since the reviews I'd read were so good. Finishing the book only brought relief. I found the story implausible, the writing incredibly overblown, and the sex scenes (written in a woman's voice)so unrealistic for the character and gender of the character that they were almost offensive (and I'm not a prude). Having read many books that I loved that included dialect as well as foreign language, (Cormack McCarthy's Cities of the Plains and Ferrol Sams' Run with the Hores being among my favorites), I found Payne's use of NC English more than mildly irritating. Overall, this book was a real disappointment. With so much out there, why bother with this one."
2,Stilted,"Payne cannot carry off writing in a woman's voice. I had difficulty believing many of these conversations, especially the ones involving Day, and I don't think that he can write realistic sex scenes, either. I know that Day is supposed to be tough and independent but the words didn't ring true.I found the premise of the story interesting but it was not handled well. Some of the plot elements that I think were supposed to be surprising simply were not.A missed opportunity for an author to say something interesting about changing cultures."
2,Strained simile and muddy metaphor,"""... like a happy bacterium suspended in a petri dish of nutrient-rich female attention.""""... his biceps moving like a languid python under his brown skin..."".""A powerful story that is a joy to read""??(back cover). No, no, no. It's a good story that's difficult to read because it's smothered in strained simile and muddy metaphor."
4,Fills unfulfilled,"Horror is not cheesy, that part works.Could have had better closure and give a full view of what the movie thinks is life, death and what's in between.Acting is very good."
3,"If you like Christina Ricci and Liam Neeson, this is for you","I caught this on Netflix, so reviewing based on what I saw there. The movie was very slow paced, but Liam Neeson did a fantastic job with the material he was given. Christina Ricci also did well for the material given, and as always, was beyond hot. Lots of her throughout nude, if you're into that. The ending is rather predictable, and throughout you are kept guessing to as to what really is going on. Some of it didn't really make sense...like (spoiler) was she hallucinating on drugs, dreaming, dead and seeing ghosts or what? That never really got a total answer, but I'd get it was the stuff injected into her. It is surely watchable once, and with Christina in it flaunting her stuff, good for a second go-around for visuals only. I didn't feel the need to go back for a second helping, even with that considered."
3,After.After.Life,"After watching this I have to say it was just OK. It did seem to have a story line. I didn't fall asleep. Hey, Christina Ricci nude for 90 mins, Gotta like that."
1,Not a good movie,Don't like the movie and the end is very bad. The story is very tempting to watch but I regret it after I watched it.
3,Chritins Ricci fans delight,Well I thought it was so so. Not very gory and not very scarey but mildly amusing. AS usual Christina looked as beautiful as ever. I thought the story tended to ramble a little.
3,equal parts scary and silly,The not so good: It is not clear why Neeson's character is so unwilling to let these possibly undead people go; Ricci could have tried harder to escape; the boyfriend is rather unappealing (and why doesn't he go to jail for assaulting the kid?).The better: Neeson is great as usual; the kid is pretty good; nice locations; creepy concept.
1,Waste of time,If you value your time please leave this film where you find it!The main character is an idiot who is just not resourceful and cunning as she needs to be when dealing with a psychopath like liam's character...Who by the way is very convincing in his part.I can understand why this film when quickly from the movie theatres...Other than the special effects nothing to see here like a cop would say after a car crash to get people to move on..
3,Like After-Life,"I have to say I liked this film. I agree it was slow moving but thought provoking. Some of the scenes were a bit contrived like the argument and accident scene, but still it kept me interested. It reminded me of a little horror movie called ""Kissed"" where the heroine could not connect with living people and could only love the dead.Ricci's character walks through life and misses out much like she is dead and when she really is ""dead"" she finds out what living is all about. Neeson's character may be the stand in for the grim reaper himself taking people who have lost their lust for life. Inany case he is the only one who can communicate with the recently dead.I too was puzzled that Liam Neeson would chose this film, but perhaps it helped him work through his own grief."
1,LIAM NEESON IS SUCH A GOOD ACTOR. WHAT WAS HE THINKING WHEN HE SIGNED ON TO THIS DUD?????,Even RICCI'S GRATUITOUS NAKEDNESS COULD NOT HELP THIS LOSER. This movie is really about nothing and more of nothing. RICCI'S DEAD--yes/no? NEESON is GOOD GUY/BAD GUY/NUT? There you have it. WHAT A WASTE!! YUK!!
1,"Huh, what???",How could anyone have liked or made sense of this stupid movie. Horrible from start to finish! Never really been a fan of Christina Ricci's but I love Liam Neeson as an actor. Why he choose to be in this mess of a movie is beyond me. Was she dead or wasn't she? Someone please explain it to me. What was with that creepy kid who actually proved of no use to anyone. And the boyfriend who was supposed to be the night and shinning armor but actually ended up getting killed to by Liam Neeson. This was a complete dud! If you haven't seen it yet please dont. You'll just be left scratching your head.
3,Evil over good,The movie was slow but interesting. It's the kind of movie that leaves you scratching your head in a bad way at the ending thinking that a scene got deleted or that the movie should be longer. If you like evil to triumph over good this is a must see but you might walk away mad.My main problem with the movie is that it wasn't bad but they could have done so much more with the premise.
4,Unique Film Well Done,"Here's a unique story that falls away from the standard torture porn of the last decade. It's an interesting story with good acting. Some reviewers here need everything spelled out. This film comes pretty close to doing so, but leaves a small trace of ambiguity. Amazon needs to see the film again. This isn't in-your-face Saw horror that leaves nothing to the imagination and kills a few brain cells in the process. This is an entertaining film that has you talking afterwards & thinking about what you saw.What's real, who's right? There's clues throughout the film to let you know. We need more films like this to bring intelligence to horror.Parts of Christina's nudity may be CGI enhanced, so be careful of that (in real life, she's actually a well tattooed woman, unfortunately)."
4,stays with you,"after.life is about a girl (ricci) who is in a car accident and wakes up to find herself at the local funeral director where eliot (neeson) is preparing her body for her funeral,anna doesnt believe she is dead and finds it hard to cope, trapped inside the funeral home anna is forced to face her deepest fears and accept her death.annas grief-stricken boyfriend paul (long) cant shake the nagging suspicion that eliot is hidding something.this movie really got to me because it questions what really happens when you die and what happens if your not really died, all i know is that i dont want to be buried in the ground."
3,afterlife is a cool journey,After Life is the kind of movie that is creepy and harrowing both at the same time.After a car crash Anna {christina Ricci} wakes up in a funeral home.Eliot Deacon{Liam Neesom}is preparing her body for viewing.She's caught between the living and the dead world.Maybe I will be the only one who writes a good review for this movie.In all do respect it wasn't that bad in fact I liked this better than the Sixth Sense.Keep your expectations down and you won't be disapointed.
2,Disappointing and Bland,"The movie has a very interesting plot and potential to be very intelligent and even contrivertial. However, there seems to be a lot of holes in the story, and the overall feel is very bland. It was neither suspenseful nor thrilling, and the acting seemed forced; the cast seemed very disconnected. I found it a boring and predictable movie. It did keep my attention because I kept waiting for it to get better but it didn't. I would not recommend this movie."
3,After Life.,"Hello DVD buyers of Amazon,you are probably looking for a review that is helpful yet to the point.Here is my take on After Life.Save the money if you are not a fan of Liam Neeson Justin Long or Christina Ricci.However, if you are not a fan but are intrigued by a subtle turn for Justin Long Check it out.If you think Christina Ricci is hot and are a die hard fan...get it.If you enjoy a sympathetic individual that you don't know is a serial killer but could pass as one...check it out LIAM NEESON...is the next best behind of course Christoph Waltz's oscar winning Bastards...in terms of sympathetic killers you love and hate in todays film history.Otherwise...save the money but enjoy a night of entertainment if you decide it buy it."
2,Morbid and repulsive,"This film was well acted and photographed. However, the subject matter is very disturbing. The mortition has frequent hallucinations in which he talks to the dead person he is inbalming. Unfortunate for the young lady and her fiancee, he is convinced that all bodies sent to his mortuary are actually dead. So when the person argues with him and moves on the table, he still does not think they are alive. Or possibly, this man is a murderer and realizes they are alive, but he imbalms them, anyway. Creepy! The ""dead"" school teacher is buaried alive!"
2,"Visions, Trips and Crowled Rooms","I commend the author for writting about this subject; I think that topic needs to be discussed. The book consisted mainly of different peoples' experiences with dead people showing up when someone was about to die. Unfortunitely, after reading the first few, the rest of the book was basically all redundant."
1,Waste Of Film Material,"I found this movie a totalwaste of time and wondering how these actors even agreed on taking a role in it. It was a long, drawn out, completely pointless movie. I knowit's fiction,but this is just a bad movie. It didn't make any sense and it was impossible to figure this movie out. Even the end was left wide open. Was she dead or not? Do dead people leave their breath on a mirror? If they don't, why did the funeral director bothered wiping it away and tried to hide it. If she was dead why give her shots every time someone is coming or she gets out of hand. Can spirits really wreck a whole room? Stupid!"
3,Little to weird for me,"This is really complex movie, It was weird it was good and it really makes you wonder if she is really dead or not dead, it was kind of slow moving, but kept you wondering and interested. it reminded me of someone who was murder mystery not really anything to do with the afterlife itself. just someone who kills them and makes them think there dead and actaully buries her alive. and the boyfriend realizes she is alive but buy that time it is to late, and he gets caught by the mortion ok movie worth buying for $10 not $15 or higher"
1,Slow and totally forgettable.,Performances were good but the plot was absolutely terrible. It could have been so much more. I want my 2 hours back.
2,Can You Just Pick One Story or The Other?,"The problem I had with AFTER.LIFE is: I couldn't figure out whether Christina Ricci was either killed in a car wreck and only Liam Neeson as a weirdly-psychic mortician could interact with her, or if Liam was nuts and keeps severely-wounded victims alive as he prepares them for burial. That's the source of suspense in the film, and it's not bad...but eventually, especially before the end credits, you might want to have that cleared up for us.But I don't think it does. And that seriously frustrates anyone who invests any caring at all in this film.The one really good part of the movie: if you want to see Christina Ricci naked, you've hit pay dirt. She spends quite a bit of time naked on the slab as Liam prepares her for her funeral. Once he dresses her, I kind of lost interest. So I suppose that means the movie doesn't work so well itself."
3,Belongs on a cold slab,"I had high hopes for this film based on the premise and cast, but it just doesnt work. There's no plausible explanation to suspend the disbelief of the viewer. Justin Long was consistently overacting throughout the entire film - moving my feelings for his character from sympathy to mere annoyance. There was no explanation of Christina Ricci's walking, talking corpse or how exactly Liam neeson was helping her to make a transition. There were simply no apparent rules as to what was going on, and even at the end where you would expect an 'oh!' moment of clarification, you're left with a 'huh?' instead."
4,Final Acceptance...,"AFTER. LIFE features Christina Ricci (SLEEPY HOLLOW, CURSED, THE GATHERING) as a woman named Anna, who dies in an automobile accident. Perhaps? Definitely? I guess. Liam Neeson (DARKMAN) is the undertaker, meeting Anna in the funeral home, while preparing her body. Meanwhile, Anna's boyfriend Paul (Justin Long from JEEPERS CREEPERS, DRAG ME TO HELL, etc.) becomes increasingly convinced that Anna isn't dead. Of course, we know she is deceased... er, Maybe. AFTER. LIFE is a tale of remorse, regret, and hope for a second chance. A lot of people seem to not like the way it ends, but I enjoyed the whole movie. The fact of a naked Ms. Ricci posing on a slab, and slinking about had no influence on my vote. Well, maybe a little..."
3,Great Potential with no spark,"The movie has all the right ingredients, but is never makes it to the next level. I would say approx 1/3 of the entire movie is Christina Ricci laying on the morgue table...just laying there not doing a thing. There was no ""UMPH"" no actual ""THRILL"" to this so called thriller. There were 3 scenes (maybe about 4-5 mins each) that were almost hitting that ""spark"" and then they fade back to her laying on the morgue table...juuuust laying. I almost think that this was more of a directoral issue, because honestly the idea of what the movie is played on is a great structure. Oh well. I would suggest this to people just to hear what there thought on it are. It's definately not a terrible movie, it just lacks what make Hollywood famous. The only part I didn't like were the last 8-15 minutes or so, there really isn't a conclusion, and it left me feeling ""Really? I just watched this for 2 hours for that?"" My suggestion: Rent but Don't Buy"
3,Are the dead really dead ?,"A woman lies on the morgue table and as the undertaker commences to prepare her for the viewing. She protests and resists and states that she is alive. Christina Ricci is nude most of the time but beyond that there is an interesting premise, What if the people in the morgue were really not dead? A movie with a fair amount of suspense and a bizarre ending, three stars. 10/17/10"
5,"Good movie, better acting and a great plot","About ""After.Life"": A perfect scary movie to watch at home with friends and popcorn. Some people say that the argument is difficult to get, I wouldn't say that. Mss Ricci does an amazing job once again.About the dvd: Fine. There's a video where the director gives us some clues about the storyline.You shouldn't miss it!"
1,One long snooze-fest,"This movie was garbage - one of the worst I've seen all year.The plot was plodding and I found myself wanting to fast forward waiting for something, anything, to happen.The ""horror"" wasn't there.There was nothing ""thrilling"" about it.I wish I had paid more atttention to the (many) other negative reviews."
2,A movie that toys with it's reality,"Clearly the people making this movie thought that displaying Christina Ricci's naked body (I hope that a warmer was placed in the porcelain mortuary table) and confusing the viewers about whether she was alive or not was sufficient to make a movie. A note to the director: cadavers do not breathe, and cannot fog a mirror. This, however, is one of the ways in which the director attempts to trick the viewer into thinking that the Ricci's character may be alive and the prisoner of a psychotic undertaker, not one who can communicate with the dead. Creating this ambiguity is the ""shtick"" of this movie. Confusing the viewer by creating ambiguity about is real and what isn't in the context of the story a gimmick that been used before, and it's one I detest. It's is equally unsettling - a sad ending for the Mac person."
1,Just terrible.,"Want something to do worth taking up 1 hour and 44 minutes of your time? It's not watching this movie! This was terrible. I could not even stay interested in this movie. I will watch just about anything and I found myself starting to play games on my phone half-way through. No ""thriller"" aspect whatsoever.Casting? Christina Ricci is perfect for the creepy, pale, dead girl role and she did a good job. Liam Neeson, not so much. If you want to see a good Liam Neeson movie, check out one of his action flicks (Taken, Unknown) - he is much better in that role.Then there is the ending. I still do not understand what happened. I was able to follow ""Inception"" (for those of you that saw it, this makes sense) but I can't follow ""After.Life""? Who knows. I don't want to add any spoilers in my review, so I will leave it at that. It just does not make sense."
2,"INTERESTING PREMISE, BUT VERY INCONSISTENT!","'After. Life' is a decent film with an interesting premise and a good cast. I love Neeson and Ricci(...and Long in comedies), but the film seems to not know what it wants to be. Is it about after life? or a murdering funeral director?, or a drama about someone mistakenly taken for dead after an accident? I know this was probably done on purpose(to throw us off the trail), but in the end it just makes for a confusing mess that leaves you less than satisfied.Is the film worth seeing? I think so, at least for me. I thought the actors did a decent job and I certainly didn't mind looking at Ricci naked for the majority of the film, but instead of leaving me thinking about an intriguing subject, it made me feel like I had been had!"
1,A lone dissenter...,"I'm going to take a different tack here and say quite honestly that I found this book not at all to my liking. Perhaps my opinion is colored by the fact that I am entirely disinterested in the whole Di tragedy, though I am not without a certain measure of respect for her civic works. Anyway, I found this book to be amateurish, the storyline implausible, and the emotions expressed within quite unsubtle in their attempts to tug at the heartstrings. It has the tone of an internet fan-fiction, without the polish one would expect from a published (and rather pricey) volume. Additionally, some passages were structurally awkward, which obscured meaning and plot flow. I'd recommend this book only to those die-hard Di fans out there with a twenty to burn. ...but go ahead and buy it if you're so inclined. After all, a portion of the proceeds does go to charity. Or so I'm told."
5,Tremendous,"A tremendous work of fiction that dazzles the imagination. It builds as it goes along, and has great moments of humor and tragedy. There is a great subplot in which Agnon writes from the point of view of a wild dog who runs loose through Jerusalem. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of what Jaffa was like in the twenties and thirties. Considered the greatest Hebrew novel ever written by multiple critics."
2,redundancy compilation!,"This one is not dedicated to any die hard deep purple or rainbow fans, but only for youngsters who love them for the very first time. The songs are remaining the same like the other one which had been appeared in the old LP's for 20 years ago.If you love DP and its relatives bands, pls buy the original albums. Keep away from this redundancy cd compilation. Deep Purple Dramatician O. Jon"
5,Amazing and Insightful,I love love love this book! It has formed the basis for many of my religious and feminist writings. I think that any one could learn a lot from this book but you have to have patience because it does require a lot of time and intellectual energy to get through it. I love it though. I was amazed at the insights and theory and enjoyed following some of them a bit further. Perkins is just a great thinker and writer.
1,I was disappointed...,"The subtitle of the book is ""A Christian Minister's Defense...."" So how can a man with a doctorate in theology have such a poor understanding of Scripture?If you're a conservative, Bible-believing Christian looking for a conservative biblical approach to the Harry Potter/Christianity issue, this book will surely disappoint you. The author takes a very dim view of Scripture.I found John Granger's book to be much better written and far more informative."
3,Just what it says,"At the time i got this book i was interested in the strict Christian view of Harry Potter that I love. I decided that i didn't agree with a lot of what they said but i could appreciate their point view and agreed with some of it, for children. Since I am an adult I will continue to enjoy the wonder of Harry Potter."
3,"Ties with ""Irresistible""","I had the hardest time getting in line for this book at the library. It was almost always checked out. It ties as most interesting with ""Irresistible"" but the focus is on the Christian nature of the stories. Harry turns out to be Jesus made flesh and all the symbolism turns out to be as Christian as C. S. Lewis could wish. As long as you are not an extreme fundamentalist reading these stories turn out to be great Christian literature. In fact, it turns out that all moral narratives are Christian. Dr. Killinger explains why."
1,Beware-Has Dye!,I ordered this for my 6 year old autistic son. He is allergic to everything. We were surprised to open the bottle and see it colored red! Why? Whats the point? Totally useless to us. The product description did not indicate the product included dye. If this is important to you do not buy this product.
3,Olympus WS-100 digital voice,"I like the size of this recorder but was not too happy with the directions that came with it. The sound on playback is terrible. I thought it was a total waste. However, once I transferred the files to my pc and used windows media player, the sound improved greatly. So, for the price, I think the refurbished digital recorder was definitely worth the money."
4,Very good for the price,"Records in .wma so if you are looking for .mp3 this item is not for you. However, hook this up to an external or mini-microphone and you get superb quality."
3,Olympus WS-100 voice rcorder,It is difficult to seperate the recorder from the battery pack to access the USB port.The voice quality is adequate and it isn't improved when played back on my Windows 7 media player.The instruction booklet is fine. It is worth the money.
4,No carga por medio del USB,"Me ha gustado el diseño, tambien, la usabilidad por tener USB, la calidad de grabación es exc en el alto nivel, pero solo graba ocho horas en este formato, si bajas la calidad se distorsiona demasiado. Además el hecho de que no se puede cargar cuando el USB está conectado a la computadora es una lástima. Sin embargo la herramienta del microphono sensitivo es una gran ventaja por que te permite ahorrar tiempo de grabación y Noise."
5,King James Version is the Book for Me,"This book shows you how to believe the true bible (every word) for the English speaking man. The whole basis is that God promised to preserve His Word. Stauffer proves beyond question that God did just that in the Authorized Version; The King James Bible.Psalm 12:6 The words of the LORD [are] pure words: [as] silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.Note: The King James Bible is actually the 7th English bible from the received text. (pure words: [as] silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times) All of the other translations (versions) are from the Egyptian text."
2,Very Fragile,This steel does a nice job sharpening knives but it's incredibly fragile. I was using this steel in a commercial kitchen and after about a week it had nicks in the ceramic down the entire rod and even some deep cuts in the steel that catch your knife blade. I had to return it.
4,A good value for the $,"The ceramic sharpening steel is just the right size if you have a 10"" or 12"" knife as well as anything smaller. It has a well designed hand guard for safety. It does seem a little coarser than I would have liked and the ceramic is actually a thin coating over an aluminum rod(beware of chipping it). It is deceptively sturdy and has held up quite well for several weeks of use now. Over all it makes short work of reshaping the edge of a dull knife and will take the edge to a good, sharp, working edge, but I find a smoother, polished edge lasts much longer. Overall I am pleased and feel it is an effective ""sharpening rod"" and a good value for the price."
5,sharp knives wanted,it works just have to learn the basics of using it correctly. Once you do it does a great job
4,Part of the team,"I am not a high priest of sharpening, but like to keep my knifes in decent shape. This steel does its part inthe tag team of sharpening, in between a real steel and a fine stone. It does strip some minimal amount of material, but the faintenss of the metallic smears it gets from knives suggests that the material loss in minimal.Do not expect this steel to make a razor out of a worn knife, that's work for some other tool."
1,"My knife cuts into the ""ceramic""",My knife cuts into the so called ceramic.Hones very well but it is full of knicks and dings.I prefer my steel.
2,Diamond Machining Technology CS2 12-Inch Ceramic Steel,I have had this product 7 months now. I am not a good knife sharpening person so bear that in mind.The ceramic is down to the core nearly worn out. This was just used on house hold knives we own.Thank you
3,"So far, I've only used it a few times.","Compared to a much older steel (that cost me a lot less) I use/used, the only difference is it takes less time to put a good edge on my knife. The product is good, but is to expensive."
1,"Starts out good, but...","I thought this was great when I first got it, but soon it started showing wear. Now, after 4 months it is basically useless. The ceramic is worn off and it's a smooth aluminum rod. ""...the ceramic is unbreakable, resistant to wearing"" that's a laugh. Trash!"
1,Terrible,I am a daily user of my blades in the kitchen. My old steel was worn after about 4 years so I thought I'd give this ceramic one a try as I'd heard good things. Fail. If you hit the Steel at a 30 degree angle or more it creates a nick and every stroke after will get caught on that nick. I have to buy a new steel. I don't get the appeal to this product.
3,A Nice Bit of Fluff,"Here's an oldie I found in the library. A first for me of Leslie LaFoy. Jackson Stennet has just been left property in Texas and New York by his foster father and he goes to NY to claim it. His foster father has a 'family' in NY that Jackson discovers! And it goes on from there. I love tension between hero and heroine and this author is not at all bad at this genre.The characters are interesting. Lindsay, the heroine, is keeping her siblings in the style to which they have been accustomed. There are living on another planet but Lindsay desperately wants their approval and will do anything to get it. As ususal, she doesnt. Enter Jackson and the fun begins.Very nice read. A little mystery thrown in which was fairly interesting. I didnt guess the 'bad guy'. I liked the heroine and especially the hero!"
2,Ehhh,"I might be in the minority here, but I could not like this book. I didn't like Lindsay's attitude toward Jackson, she was too uptight and stuck-up. I also didn't like the way this book was written. At times it was simply boring, at others I didn't even understand what was happening, and then at those few times when it was starting to get interesting, Miss Prim and Proper wouldn't shut her mouth and just be nice to the poor guy.""Well, I do it this way and that's the way we've always done it and you don't know anything about this and I'm a very smart and successful business woman and blah blah blah blah.""She was also too modern for the times. A business woman in the 1800's? I couldn't even finish the book. I skimmed it through and wasn't really that impressed. But I might try others from Lafoy."
5,"Jeremy, the movie...","i watched this as a young person.couldn't remember the name, never forgot the movie.finally, found the name. (wasn't so hard, just had to look).this movie is really noteworthy, i think.it may not appeal to everyone, but if You like 'sweet' and the special-ness of young love- You'll love it.Glynnis O'Connor is amazing.when i was 10, or however old i was- i found Her amazing.and this time around? same. amazing. :)))peace and love to ALL,t.:))"
3,A Sweet Early Robby Benson,"This is a very nice early RobbyBenson movie. Reminds one of their first love, maybe for all nerds. A must have for Benson collections."
5,Great improvements,"The new Syllables and Affixes (formerly Syllable Juncture) sorts are great! For years as a second grade teacher, I've only had the Within Word and Letter name sort books and put together my own sorts for above-grade-level spellers, but have the sequenced sort books makes life much easier especially in teacher the stage features beyond e-drop and doubling! The lessons preceding each feature are also helpful reminders as the bulk of my students are not S&A; stage spellers.The new version is also 3-hole punched, so one could transfer it into a binder, and has a cool matte cover."
5,Brilliant CD!,"This is an extraordinary recording of a fraction of the Praetorius Dances from ""Terpsichore"" (he didn't write them, he just collected them, and there are hundreds). They range from genteel courtly dances to rumbustious affairs that are the equivalent of modern disco and which make all the ornaments on my mantelpiece dance with joy. The disc crackles and buzzes with the most extraordinary and delicious sounds - shawms, crumhorns, hurdy-gurdys, racketts - all served with a very nice recording. Quite simply, a must-have"
2,Over-rated and over-priced disk,"This disk lacks the medieval feel that I had hoped for. Many of the pieces sound baroque, similar to Handel's water music, with a lot of trumpets, and drums beating in a martial way. The rest are softer, but lack any real personality... they sound like a wind-up toy music box. I'm disappointed in the music, and unhappy with the disk."
5,Great product with good price.,This is a nice kit for contact lenses care with good price. It came in perfect condition. I'm quite satisfied with the purchase.
4,note to Boston,With all the complaints why don't they go back to the screw-on tops that consumers prefer? The flip tops are difficult to open and close and don't seem to be as good at protecting the product as he screw on tops.
5,This IS A BARGAIN!,"I've used Boston products for years, but the Boston Advance product line is the very best. Sadly, in the stores it's just not cheap! This is a SUPER BUY and I'd advise others to stock up. I have over a year on their expiration date and hope when I need more it's still on Amazon.........In these tough economic times, this is a SUPER BARGAIN!"
4,great game dev app,This program is great for anyone who really wants to make games but doesnt have the time to pour over thousands of lines of obscure code.Anyone can learn the basic syntax and have something neat on the screen in under 10 lines.Ive enjoyed this product for over 2 years now and always find something new to explore or create on a daily basis.:)
5,Great product,"DarkBASIC is one of the best game development and rapid prototyping tools you could buy. The most valuable aspect of DarkBASIC is its community. The DarkBASIC community is an active closely-knit group of game developers, 3d modelers, and musicians. The community always welcomes new members and is a superb source for help and ideas. Although the GUI isn't the best Darkbasic Is packaged with another editor called Dark Edit."
2,Very complex,"For this kind of software it's a start in the right direction but its a up-hill battle. You damn well better know your math skills with this kind of stuff, before you can even begin it tells you that you go to type in certain codes before you type in a command, and that's before you even create a character. This is the real deal and you'd better know your $&*! before you dive head first into it. The creations look like there made from windows 98, it looks pretty cubeish, but like I said, it's a start. I'm new at this kind of stuff myself and I don't want to discourage anyone but, you got to be highly motivated for it."
2,Good if you want to work hard,"This program is good if you want to mold the matrix bit by bit. But if you want to make games in a snap, spring for the professional and get a level editor on a DarkBASIC website."
3,darkbasic,"I bought this video game creator, and was at first very excited about using it. To my dismay it didn't work very well on my operating system, win7, I emailed the creators at [...] and they said to download a patch that they offer. Well I thought everything was fine so I unistalled darkbasic then reinstalled it then I downloaded the patch. Now darkbasic worked, but I couldn't use any of the media files. How am I supposed to make a game without them? I emailed a second time to [...] but they just told me the same thing they told me before. They told me to download the patch. So after more times of unistalling and reinstalling I gave up. It doesn't work on win7 for me. Hopefully other people will have better luck."
3,Takes a LOT of effort and determination.,"Don't get fooled by what they say!!! Save yourself money if you don't plan to actually work really hard and spend lots of time doing something. ANd beware...you are NOT going to create a game of a Madden 2004 level in minutes! You can make quite interesting games, but not very complicated. Only buy this if you are SERIOUS!!!"
5,great progammer,"This programmer has changed my life. My wife, my kids, my family, my students all love it."
1,Difficult Reading,"If you are looking for a book for relaxation to read, this is not it. Read a sample first, which is what I should have done. I pride myself on my reading comprehension skills, however, I found the dialogue, the one word sentences, the repetition of coffee beans, boutons, hair, finger eating, etc., so boring that I quit this book when I reached the half way mark. There have been just two books I had to ever quit, Beloved, and now A Million Nightengales, and I have read hundreds of books in my lifetime. I truly gave this book a chance, but it did not work for me. I understand prose, but understanding this prose was VERY difficult.If you are totally befuddled reading the sample, trust me, it does not get any better than that."
1,half star if I could,"WOW was this book a stinker! I mean really...first of all I had to search for the name of the main character in the book. Second I didn't realize that this was the second book in a series thus I was completely lost when Martini talked about things that happened in the first book. Also while I usually like first person books this one was just WAY to hard to follow. I felt that most of the characters that we met in the first book where not fleshed out in this one, again losing me. This was my first Martini book and it will most likely be my last."
4,Prime Witness,"I found ""Prime Witness"" to be a great read for my first venture into the writings of Steve Martini. Paul Madriani, acting as the temporary Chief Prosecutor, finds himself up against long time arch-enemy, Adrean Chambers, who is the defense attorney for the Russian suspect Andre Iganovich.The plot, well written and developed, starts with a series of double murders committed by a so called ""serial killer"" who is thought to be the Russian emigrant Iganovich. The investigation and the trial are all part of a well thought out and developed plot line, with explosive confrontations between the legal parties, and a totally unexpected and utterly surprising ending. Well worth the time and effort to read. Martini at his best!!E.J. Walden, author of ""Operation Snow Owl"""
1,You might want to read this one to enjoy his others,"This novel was confusing, slow and disjointed. No continuity or any attempt to tell a decent story. You have to be a real hard core Martini fan to enjoy this one."
3,Great book up until the end,"Prime Witness kept me glued to my seat for several evenings. For about 380 of the 400 pages, it is a real page turner. In the second book in the Paul Madriani series, our hero ends up being the District Attorney of Davenport county, a small rural county in which several serial murders have been committed. When the killer is caught, Madriani feels there is another murderer, probably a copycat at work. From there the book keeps a steady pace and the pages begin to turn themselves until about page 380. Then, all of a sudden Steve Martini must have either run out of steam, or maybe he just wanted to get the book over with. The end seems unbelievable and just comes too quickly. Still worth reading though."
4,Prime Witness,Prime Witness is another great read from Steve Martini. You will hate to put this book down until it is finished.RWD
4,mini spoilers,"It was well-enough written. I did not like, however, that 15/16ths-ish of the book built up 'bile' at injustices: these were addressed in what little space was left. For me, that aspect was overdone. 3.5 if I could.Martini's books were handed down to me. I WILL start reading the next one in the Madriani series: they're interesting enough."
2,Very Small,"The bracelet I received had very small chips. It would be ok for a child or someone who wanted a small bracelet, but if you want something bigger, this is not for you. It looked small even on my six inch wrist. I returned it. Maybe I'm expecting too much for $1.99."
4,I love one and like the other,"I ordered two of these ath the same time. I love the one that's made with round plumpish chips and I like the one that made of small flat chips. So hey, I'll give the one made of flat chips as a Christmas gift."
2,bit queasy,"The first scene and subsequent bordello scenes are supposed to show us how decadent and hollow life is for the men who only pursue pleasure. Problem is the author doesn't make the scenes different enough from the Good Sex stuff. There's a fine line between erotic and porn. I like it when it's clear which you're reading. This book blurs the line, but not because the situation is ambiguous, which is the only thing that excuses that kind of blur. Plot was okay, heroine wasn't a martyr victim type which is refreshing. But not a keeper in my library."
5,"Tragedy, Romance and Restoration","Devoid of all hope, about to be cast on the street homeless and penniless, strength to save her siblings, restoring an innocent to health and happiness, Vanessa finds love, forgiveness, and restoration."
3,"Lots of sex, but not much romance","This book features a lot of erotic sex, but very little romance. I found very little redeeming about the male leading character. The book was alright, but not the best romance I've ever read."
4,Good,"I liked the idea of this Jordan book, but I had a hard time liking Damien. He really was an ass at first. He did things for selfish reasons. At the end he was lovely and wonderful, but it was too quick a change. I loved Olivia's and Aubrey's secondary romance. That was quite endearing. And of course, as always, the intimate scenes were extremely blazing."
2,Below expectations,"I have to confess that after reading all the reviews, I was hoping for this one to be a scorcher..something along the lines of a Susan Johnson or Ceryl Holt book. This book was too bland for my liking, and while there were a lot of love scenes, they were much tamer than what I thought they would be.Secondly, the book was very short, 350 pages of large print, so I never felt that I got to know any of the characters...didn't care much for the hero to begin with!"
2,Not one of Ms. Jordans best...,"Being and avid reader of Ms. Jordan's I found myself thinking throughout this book, it has to get better! Unfortunately it didn't. The Seduction was missing that fire/blaze that is synonymous with the name Nicole Jordan. The characters were flat, frankly boring, and the sexual tension non-existent IMHO. Damien was too soft and lacked the excitement of her past hero's. After much anticipation, from her long absence, I found myself asking, ""What happened?"" Very disappointing. I can only hope the next one is better."
3,"Enjoyable, but bland","While I liked this book when I was reading it, I cannot give it high marks. I have seen too many romance novels where a daughter/sister becomes a rake's wife/mistress, because of her family gaming debts. I found the changes in both Aubrey and Sin rather hard to believe, and the heroine's heart was really too soft. (I probably would have asked Sin why didn't he kill my brother in the first place and instisted he rectified the mistake.) The author strikes me as an excellent storyteller. She just needs an original story."
4,Excelente libro!,"Me parece que es un libro increiblemente bien escrito, digno de un genio y que definitivamente vale la pena leer, probablemente las personas que no vivimos la primera y segunda guerra mundial no podamos comprender algunos acontecimientos, pero las impresiones del autor acerca de los hechos son puramente impresionistas, y tomando en cuenta la epoca en que fue escrito es una obra de arte!!"
3,un libro complicado,"la historia de este libro es un poco increible, un nino de tres anos nos cuenta sus aventuras a traves de su vida desde la prision sanatorio donde se encuentra apegado a su tambor de hojalata y a las memorias que al tocarlo le llegan.no he podido entender que queria decir el autor con la alegoria. se referia a alemania que no podia crecer? o a algun personaje en particular? el libro le falta claridad y puede hasta llegar a ser canson y aburrido, ya que da muchas vueltas y no sabe uno para donde van las cosas. sus personajes parecen sin vida, frios, y el mismo amorio entre la madre de oscar y jan brosnski parece frio, lejano espero que otro lector llegue al final de la obra y a lo mejor le pueda encontrar el significado que me quede buscando... LUIS MENDEZ."
3,que quiere decir?,"Encuento que este es un libro dificil de leer, es muy largo y ademas como que uno no logra identificarse con los personajes y entender la historia. Tal vez es que el libro tiene muchas metaforas y yo no las logre descifrar. Tengo curiosidad por ejemplo en lo que se refiere a las cuatro faldas que usaba la abuela de Oscar, cual es el significado para el. Srea dificil de saber. He tratado de encontrar algunas resenas sobre el libro y no lo he conseguido. Quizas la revision de otro lector me ayude a entender un poco de que se trata."
1,I was affended,"I was quite affended when I got this book. I whiped it out and started looking at it and was upset to see that most of the models are not wearing clothes. There was a few pages with magazine covers on them, one of which was a playboy magazine cover. If any of these things affend you also I would advise you NOT to get the book. The hairstyles weren't anything I was interested in either. I didn't read very much of the text but it didn't appear to have many directions on how the styles were made."
3,Good tips and great pics!,"I thought this book was easy to follow, and the how to's seemed easy enough. My only complaint is that there were no brand name product recommendations. It would be nice to know which products the author favors."
2,The Mane thing,"I received this book quickly, however halfway through the book relized there was a page missing from it. That was disappointing."
2,okay,expected more.pretty much the basics any hair book would have. and the rest of the book was pointless.
1,the mane thing,This is not a book for professionals. Try Kevyn Aucoin you could learn many useful tips from his book.
3,Intensely polemical,"I confess I am baffled by some of the reviews here. The one thing this book is, is polemical. It is intensely polemical. Just two examples. He characterizes part of the introduction to the book of John as a ""the forces of light defeat the (Jewish) forces of darkness."" Read John 1 yourself; there is no mention of Jews, nor any suggestion that the ""forces of darkness"" are Jewish. And read his final short ""dream"" chapter if you are in any doubt. It is a Jewish apologetic through and through.His examples of Hasids have also been sharply criticized by other scholars, and he relies on very late (ie medieval)sources for some of them. Some of his logic is tortured. Still there is lots of interesting stuff here. 4 stars for the content, 2 stars for the tendentiousness and prose."
2,Convert,"Geza Vermes is a renowned scholar who seems to have focused on researching from his own psychological backgrounds. A former Catholic priest who converted to his parents Judaic roots, he seems to continue his efforts to process this experience through his scholarship. Unfortunately, his writing and exegesis are so clouded with his own hang ups, that they strain credulity."
2,Much Too Slow,"The beginning of this book started off too slow. Although the author did a good job developing the characters, it was over-kill. My interest picked up once Alain was murdered, but the adventures through Louisiana were not only unrealistic, but at some points stereotypical (spoken from a Louisiana native). It was obvious the writer hadn't spend a lot of time in the heart of the land she wrote about. I won't give away the ending, but let's just say Carol Ann may now be able to join the ranks of Wonder Woman and the other Super Friends."
4,Class and Cash!,"It is nice to read a book that is well written about some really affluent, extremely well educated, and fearless black folks! The star, Carole Ann, is magnificent and she is the kind of woman who in real life could easily become every woman's role model. Mickelbury writes a really good book, and it is at a level that would make an extremely good movie as well. It is excitingly and intelligently written. It is done with style and class, and for that I applaud the author!(by Sandra Manigault, author of Fragments of a Woman's Life)"
4,Builds Momentum,"...this book started out slow.However, once you got past the introductions, it picked up the pace with lightning speed. There was a lot of information about Louisiana culture, one that I hadn't realized was so different from the rest of the US.An interesting read about a woman determined to find out who killed her husband, I endorse this book to anyone willing to trudge through the first few chapters.Carole Ann Gibson is here to stay.Candace..."
2,Really??,I have had a seizure disorder my entire life but it has been well maintained for the last several years. I wanted to start the discussion with my eight year old daughter so had some basic knowledge and language..but I wouldn't show her this. She would be too afarid. Can't anyone right a book about how each person has something going on with them..and this is mommy's here are so basic things to know??
4,Good book!,"I say good and not great only because the last chapter, I think could have been written better. Thoughout the entire book, it was a page turner and I couldn't stop readin it but at that last chapter the energy of the book seemed to decrease for me and it went to another extreme which I think could have worked if it in parts of the book before the last chapter the supernatural was referenced a little more, or it could be me. The writing was very good though. I would read it a second time but just leave out the last chapter. I still look forward to reading more books from Mr. Shabazz."
2,Yet another core dump,"There are thousands of core dumped edited books - no flow nor continuity, fragmented thinking. This is one of them. There a few parts worth reading but certainly not worth the cost of this tome of academic wheel spinning.One of the editors is very well known but I suspect he did not participate in the editing or quality control."
1,"The ""NOT"" Jumbo Spiderman Coloring Book","I was expecting a coloring book at least 11"" wide by 17"" long since it was suppose to be jumbo. What I got was a regular size coloring book, 8 1/2 x 11"". I found the advertisement deceptive. Wouldn't trust this company again."
4,Good for locals,This book is very comprehensive in terms of areas covered -- lots of suburban restaurants included -- and thus especially useful for people who live in the area. Only quibble is that it's time for a 2nd Ed.
5,Great Movies,"Collectors item for sure or movie buff - this are great movies and they will not be able to make any like them again. If you love them, get it you can watch them over and over again."
5,Great 4 in 1 gift!,Purchased as a gift. Recipient very happy with it - had seen all the movies but some were on VHS and some were scratched.Great price too for 4 movies.
5,The Ultimate vacation with Chevy Chase,"I love all of the National Lampoons videos. All three are so cute and funny. Chevy Chase has always been a favorite of mine. I like the fact the with the series, they have certain actors that are in it with them. These videos are classics and I'm happy that I can add this to my library"
5,Love His Movies...Even if He is Weird,"I love the Chevy Chase Vacation movies...which makes it hard when he speaks publicly about his political views. Great movies, funny, funny, funny...and then he comes off as a liberal robot without a clue. If these movies weren't so dear to me as a reminder of my youth I would NOT watch them. It's one of those situations where you have to close your eyes to his political views and just enjoy the movie...which is becoming increasingly necessary with Hollywood these days. Some movies/celebrities deserve to be boycotted, though, when they cross the line. Chevy Chase has kept his political mouth shut lately so I applaud him for that and will watch his movies and laugh."
4,Entertaining,Our family enjoys watching the antics of the Griswald family so this was a good package to buy.
5,Can't go wrong with the Grisswalds,"Bought this for my husband for christmas, though he's already got it. Nothing like Griswald's for christmas! Sure wouldn't be christmas without them!I like the fact this came as a set instead of having to buy each one or hunt them all down.A keeper for the holidays and any time of year!"
3,The Terminal,"This movie moves a little slow, but all in all, a good movie. I would definately recommend it as a renter."
3,ultimate vacation,Great to finally have all 4 vacations...HOWEVER package suggests that they would be different rather than the 4 on one disc. Should have read more carefully for the price.
3,okay...,"just one disc with two movies on each side- wasn't wowed but, hey, I paid for the movies and I got the movies.."
5,Love these Movies,"Huge fan of the Four Favorites. No Christmas season is complete without watching Christmas Vacation. Enjoy a laugh with the kids, but beware their are a few parts that suggest the ""non-existence"" of the white bearded fella."
2,From a dolphin lover in the highest degree,"I'm passionate about dolphins, and I couldn't get through the book. I felt as if the author didn't like dolphins, and didn't really respect them. I hate to be saying this about a book that seemed at first glance so wonderful, but I didn't feel as if the book protrayed positive feelings. I just feel as if the author doesn't like dolphins, and I think that a book that is written in a way that might seem emotional, but doesn't portray true feelings or a love for the creatures that are said to be loved. If the tone is to be set in one way, the words used should reflect that tone."
1,"Great seller, but item does not work with Sony TRV520","I bought this battery because it is supposed to be a replacement for a dead Sony InfoLithium NP-F960. It appears to charge up fine, but when you try to use it in the camera, the camera rejects it with a message that says ""for 'infolithium' battery only.""The seller, however, was extremely courteous and extended me two different RMA numbers, even after I forgot to send in the first RMA. So just be sure you are buying the right battery."
2,Don't be fooled!,"""Back by popular demand!"" reads the blurb. In a manner of speaking, perhaps. Having lost my original copy of this book years ago, I was elated to see it in print again. Upon its arrival, however, I was extremely disappointed to find this edition significantly altered from its earlier counterpart. I've been a performing folk musician for more than half my life now, and I no longer find sheet music necessary. In fact, it was not for the sheet music that I purchased this folio, but for the gorgeous color production stills appearing in the old version. Much to my chagrin, this wonderful material had been omitted from the new collection, the blurb's claim of ""great color photos"" notwithstanding. Furthermore, those of you who were interested in this book for its musical content should be aware that these are not authentic transcriptions, nor is the entire body of selections from the former collection included. I can recommend the current edition to the John Denver completist only."
2,Conditioner,"I wrote a previous review for the Dry and Itchy Shampoo which is the first product to use before this conditioner. I love the shampoo and don't like this conditioner in this form. I have found a conditioner from Carol's Daughter products, the Black Vanilla Conditioner which is in a spray bottle. The spray bottle allows for better manageability of the product. I used this in conjunction with the Dry and Itchy Shampoo, which in my opinion is a much better product between the two. If your willing to try both products together, definitely get the smaller size of 16oz bottle to try before this large size."
1,Yikes...,"These aren't the original hits but inferior rerecordings by (I think) Johnny Moore and his British-based Drifters lineup. Beyond the poor quality of the music, this is the worst-designed CD package I have ever encountered. It's impossible to remove the discs from the paper fold-out package without tearing it to bits. This is totally useless; pay the extra bucks and invest in the originals on Atlantic, Rhino or WEA UK."
3,"Nice lamps,, the shade is TAN","These are nice lamps, well worth the 49 each I paid for them, however the description says the shades are ivory linen, which would look great in my family room. In truth, they are tan, the color of a Starbucks napkin. The only option offered to me by the bored customer sevice rep was a complete return. Too bad. One more thing,, Lamps Plus advertises that they are open from 6am to 9pm Pt,, they are actually open 9am to 4:30 PT. Shipping took over a week."
1,Disappointing book,"I thought this would help guide you through some of the missions, however, it's just an exact copy of the mission briefing screens! There's nothing added, so just read your mission briefings and save your money."
4,Fascinating perspective,"I agree with the previous comment that this is a scholarly work and isn't intended to read like the latest Stephen King novel. While some may say that the book is biased, I'd say the author has something called a ""hypothesis"" and uses his research to back it up. You can disagree with some of his research but it is the arguably one of the first attempts to define this subculture. A fascinating read with some very enlightening observations, especially to someone who was raised in rural Southeast America. The comments about the Christianity portions of this book are short sighted and make me wonder why people seem so offended that the author wrote about Paganism and racism in the context of diverging Christian beliefs. I think some readers were wanting something that the author never really claimed to have in this book. Good read!"
3,A hard book to read ..,"because of style and content. Other reviewers have correctly noted the atrocious style and the author's political point of view.What was most useful to me was learning of the existence of such people. I Google-searched 'Aryan' and got 220,000 hits; many were anti-hate sites. (I got over 21 million hits for 'sex')I finished the book discouraged by human stupidity and with some insight into these people's pathetic attempts at pride. ""I may look like Bob, the dropout with an $8/hour job at the filling station. But I'm really a descendant of Odin!"""
1,No lid! Glossy! Picture color inadequate!,"This sugar bowl is usually sold in a ""sugar and creamer set"", as pictured. I considered it a two-item set: a sugar bowl and a creamer, not and three-item set: a sugar bowl, a lid, and a creamer pitcher. Well, I got only a bowl. The title should have said ""Bowl Only, no Lid, for Replacement.""I ordered several accessories to complement my stoneware plates. The color is not properly pictured, neither is the glaze finish, which in fact is glossy, but on the picture it looks more like matte stoneware. These dishes are much thicker than my stoneware and they look cheap.The price of shipment was more than twice the cost of the item. The item is round 4""x4"" and 2.25"" high. It arrived in a small (9.5""x9.5""x4.5"") cardboard box, lined with styrofoam sides, placed in a large box (18.5""x13""x6""), with additional air-filled plastic pockets. A little packaging overkill, don't you think?"
4,Tasty but not really Granola,Great tasting cereal but not really granola. A little on the sweet side but delicious!
2,definitely a CEREAL not granola,"I read all the reviews and thought what the heck, I'll give it a try anyways, it's only $15. I really should have listened to the other bad reviews.This indeed is a CEREAL, complete with corn flakes. It is exactly like one of the reviewer said: ""mixed bag cereal"". it's odds and ends from other cereals.Buy the Peace cereal French Vanilla Granola instead. That one is absolutely delicious.Now I have 8 boxes of cereal sitting here that's going to go to waste. :("
2,weak,"I purchased this at an Amazon promotional price, and still don't think it's worth it. There are crunchier and tastier cereals elsewhere at comparable prices. Try some of the Post cereals."
3,Slow tempi,"I bought this CD because I wanted a period-instrument performance of the Orchestral Suites. I have always been a great fan of Philip Pickett and The New London Consort and they have never disappointed me up to now, but this recording cant't be the best period performance on the market. Of course there are some very good things here and the Suites are played elegantly and warmley, but the tempi must be among the slowest on CD. Especially the famous ""Badinerie"" from BWV 1067 played to slow. Buy only this CD if you enjoy slow tempi."
5,The best of the best,"These are glorious and works of supreme wonder. Among the many recorded versions of these works, this is my absolute favorite.Other honorable mentions would be Goebel (Archiv), Richter (Archiv), and Pinnock (Archiv). But Pinnock reaches glorious heights that the others do not."
4,Good little tool,"This is a pretty good deal for the price.I have used this to scrape paint, apply putty and clean paint rollers. It worked fine.I also use the flat side of the tip (the side opposite the pointy side) to open paint cans.I have not tried to use it to remove nails. I'm not sure how well it would work on medium to large size nails.All in all a useful tool. (I agree w/ other reviewers regarding how difficult the label is to remove -- pieces of mine are still stuck on after months of use . . .)"
5,Must have for any DIY'er.,"Purchased this for caulk removal in my master bath. Worked like a charm and made the job so much easier than my prior attempt with lesser tools. It's a good size and has a nice grip. Not too small, not too big. The blade is solid and sturdy, and it could stand up to some serious pounding and scraping. With multiple edges in a variety of shapes and angles, this tool will definitely come in handy around the house. It's a must have for anyone looking to get a few projects like caulking, painting, patching, etc. done on their own."
5,Excellent,"Can't get these in UK, but worth the wait for them to get here. I have 2 of this model and a really old one which get used every day as a glazing tool. Will buy again when they get lost."
5,Good inside look at Dale Jr.,This is an excellent look into the thought process and what happened when Dale Jr. decided to go to another race team. This is a must have for anyDale Jr. fan.
4,A nice little gem of a film,"The basic story of The Couple takes place during World War II in Nazi Germany and centers on a German couple that works for a wealthy Jewish industrialist who because of his wealth, is afforded a chance to ""buy"" his freedom from the Nazis. Without going into too much detail, I found that this movie had the right amount of suspense, tension, action and emotion -once I got over the thick British accents from all of the characters in this film.The backdrop, scenery and sets were gorgeous, and if you want to see a movie about Love, hope and the determination of the human spirit in the face of evil, this definitely one to see!"
5,The Couple is a great movie,"This movie was excellent, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes WWII and the behind the scenes events that took place.This story highlights a wealthy business man who employed 3,000 Germans, and the negotiations between himself and high ranking officials within German Army.THe young couple that works for them are German (we are led to believe) but the true story takes an interesting turn when we find out that this couple are Jewish as well.Great Movie!"
5,THE COUPLE,INTERESTING TRUE STORY THAT NEEDS TO BE TOLD. THE WEALTHY HELPINGTHEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR WORKERS. GOODNESS IN MANKIND WHEN FACINGADVERSITY AND DEATH
2,Romanticised view of overcoming facism,"I am always fascinated by films about Holocost, but this was was utterly disappointing. It is a story set during WWII in Hungary where a young German couple is serving a wealthy Jewish man on his estate in the countryside. The premise of the story is that child-free wealthy man and his wife are using all of their assets to buy freedom for their extended family.It is a story about value of family, strength of Jewish spirit, one German soldier's word and our innate power for survival. But story feels unreal and unauthentic. In my opinion, it perpetuates idea that for as long as Jews ""showed their money"" they were able to regain their freedom and be spared of concentration camps. That is very far from the truth of the harsh realities of the WWII extermination camps."
1,low standards,"This is a picturesque 'B' movie. I found it insulting to the intelligence of any reasonable person. They might as well have titled it 'let's hate Nazis, yay!'"
2,suspend all belief,"There isn't much to praise in this movie beyond Martin Landau's performance. As a period piece, it misses nuances and details. It is ""well made"", but you never believe to be transported into the 1940ies. As for character development, there is none. You find all the necessary types needed for a good guys- bad guys movie, accented with romance. ""The Couple"" is very cliché ridden, to the point of being embarrassingly simplistic and predictable. It felt like a 5th grader's attempt of writing a script about bad Nazis and heroic resistance. I am very surprised that other reviewers see this movie as such a gem. Like the movie "" I am David"", this one gives the viewer a fluffy version of what resistance, love, and redemption is supposedly all about. Rather annoying, when there are excellent movies available about this time period and subject."
3,"Correct Title is ""The Aryan Couple""","The correct title of this film (as documented at IMDB) is ""The Aryan Couple"". I have no idea why Amazon chose to shorten it to just ""The Couple"". I can only imagine it has to do with marketing, but I find it a little disturbing to have part of this dark chapter of history changed (sanitized?) in such a way."
5,Spell-binding,The movie portrayed a scenario that assuredly occured in Nazi-held lands. It is a gripping account of survival and going the extra mile for someone you care about.I am a student of this era and this type of genre. Worth the investment!
3,Sentimental Romantisized View of the Holocaust,"I typically love movies about the holocaust. However, this tale about a wealthy childless industrialist who buys his extended family out of the death Camps will not be a favorite. The scenary and props were accurate and well done, but the characters were one dimensional and not realistic. The movie was suspense filled and exciting, but the characters were too romantisized. The movie highlights the conflict between Himmler and Eichman of which I was unaware. However, there are better dramas about the holocaust. I am surprised an actor as esteemed as Martin Landau would star in such a weak film. Find domething else."
3,a few are good most are going to the dogs,"bought this book of short stories involving white house pets. While a couple of the mysteries are on the good side, most are bland and I found somewhat boring.Overall not worth the money unless you pay $.99 for Kindle."
5,Butterscotch,As I must cook for someone with type 2 diabetes and watch my weight I was so glad that Amazon offered this flavor in sugar free. It is almost impossible to find it in my stores as I live in a rural area. It is a nice change from the chocolate and vanilla which are the only local choices
3,Disappointing,"While I thoroughly enjoyed China Bride, the Heir was disappointing. For her to engage in an affair after being married only one year was preposterous. Her willpower to resist Peter Lau disappointed me. Why Luk chose to have her give into him is beyond me. Also having multiple men in love with her requires a suspension of disbelief."
1,I tried too,"Hey, congratulate me; I made it through 90 pages. My main complaint is the swearing. Good grief, once it started it was non-stop (I only checked the first five or so pages when I picked it up in the bookstore). I would never be friends with such a foul-mouthed toad. It should have been an enjoyable book, but it went nowhere. The uncomplicated development took place in maybe the first ten pages and then the story should have gotten underway, but didn't. It never started, never went anywhere. Let's hope Anne Tyler can keep being entertaining. Or try a children's book. Saffy's Angel by Hilary McKay is funny."
5,Brilliant chick lit from ireland,"I loved this book! what's not to like - it's funny, full of great characters and made me laugh out loud. I really recommend this book to anyone who likes Marian Keyes."
3,Fun but lost intrest quick,The toy was neat at first since it was a fishing pole like daddy's but doesn't care for much anymore.
2,2 Stars,"The the only reason I gave it two stars is because my daughter asks to play with it in the tub. In a Christmas rush/frenzy I purchased this toy as a stocking stuffer, thinking that you can reel in the line. It is nearly impossible to hook the fish. The line flops toward that handle making it very hard to use."
3,Disappointed,"Not exactly what I thought when I ordered. Was disappointed when it arrived & the fishing pole doesn't actually have a working reel to reel in the fish. The ""string"" on the fishing pole is plastic & fixed, so it doesn't allow for raising & lowering of the hook with the reel. But my daughter does still enjoys playing with it, although she loses interest in it quickly."
2,I wouldn't buy again,"I really don't like this product. The only thing my daughter likes is the fact that the items stick to the wall of the tub. The fishing poll really doesn't work well, and she definitely cannot fish with it."
4,Really cute little toy,My 3 year old daughter used this for the first time tonight in the tub. She seemed to really enjoy it and was excited each time she caught one of the fish. It's a simple bath toy...not meant to be too complicated or have too many pieces involved. I think it's great so far. Just hope it doesn't break like I read in someone else's review. My daughter kept busy with this for a while and really enjoyed it. It's a keeper! I recommend for anyone looking for a simple toy for the bath..
2,Not so great anymore,"As a 22-year devotee to Walt Disney World and its environs, I used to depend on Birnbaum's guides to give me the inside scoop and all the correct information without overwhelming with text and photos. It seems since Mr. Birnbaum's death, however, that the book is now poorly edited, full of grammatical errors and just plain unenjoyable to read. Though it saddens me to say so, I'll just depend on the WDW website instead."
5,"GENERALLY EXCELLENT, FOUR SEASONS LACK VIVACITY","This is a beautiful collection, by one of the world's leading Baroque orchestras. The Academy of Ancient Music is a group of 17 musicians led by Christopher Hogwood, the founder. This collection of 5 CDs has a stellar programme... from the Pachelbel CANON to the CONCERTO ALLA RUSTICA by Vivaldi. The renditions are mostly excellent. I especially liked the two Brandenburg Concerti included here (3 and 4). They are very bubbly. A weak point to me was the Four Seasons... the right notes, the right sound but this segment is lacking in brightness. Well worth buying, try to find it at a reasonable price."
5,Astounding!,"This product has truly exceeded my expectations. The compositions, which vary by author, seem to be out of this world. It would have have been amazing to have lived in those times. Beautiful!"
1,Not worth it,"I got this for my daughter (2 years, 9 MO.) Its not worth it. She open it, and only played with the sunglasses. Its not even a Purse! Not worth the $10.00."
1,A good laugh for anyone into aviation...,"I was subjected to about an hour of this film. It apparently puts together a conspiracy out of ""holes"" in the crash, investigation, etc. and to be fair I think they did a great job considering it's quite obvious that they didn't consult anyone who was even remotely knowledgeable about aviation (as an aside, I'm a Commercial/Instrument Pilot and Flight Instructor with about 5,000 hours.)I'm still in awe over how badly they did on basic fact checking, and I don't mean the smokey grey bits they use to build a conspiracy. I'm talking about basic things about how an airplane flies and FAA regulations. These errors could have been caught by a student pilot whose strongpoint is the ability to recognize an airplane two out of three times.In conclusion, I don't think I could ever recommend anyone purchase this video unless maybe you need a gag gift for a pilot."
4,The cure for the common politi-cold.,"Roy Nunn's political prose gets right to the heart of some of this country's biggest problems. It is quiet and unassuming while still plainly exposing the flawed logic in American society's current, chosen path. This should be required reading."
3,Bartoli deserved better.,"La Clemenza di Tito has been very lucky on disc. From the 2 great performances Teresa Berganza left us, with Kertesz (DECCA) and Bohm (DG) up to this one, no recording of this work is really bad. Christopher Hogwood is his usual British self. Very prim and proper, and a little bit boring. The real tragedy of this set is the unacceptable performance of Della Jones as Vittelia. I can't understand how DECCA can present such an unpresentable performance. The voice is hard and uninteresting, her performance just silly. Cecilia Bartoli on the other hand, is exceptional as expected. She is the real heir to the incomparable Teresa Berganza. What a pity DECCA didn't think of Charlotte Margiono. For a period performance of La Clemenza di Tito I much prefer Sir John Eliot Gardiner's recording in ARCHIV. Anne Sofie von Otter is also very good, but the sensational performance in this set is Julia Varady's fiery, Callas-like, Vittelia. For her alone, I would own this set."
3,Reflection Of Something,"This is Todd Agnew followup to his debut and it just doesnt grab you like his first CD does. Dont get me wrong it still has the powerful lyrics and Agnew unique voice but it just isnt the same. Songs that are great though are ""My Jesus"" which shows us the real Jesus and how he is portrayed. ""In the middle of me"" is just a fun sing along song. ""Isaih 6"" and ""Unchanging One"" are also standout songs. If your a fan then this is a must buy but If you can then buy a few of the songs not the whole album."
4,highly recommended,"Very user friendly, easy to follow and learn at your own pace, unlike the more comprehensive GED books that can be overwhelming for home study. The only thing missing is a practice/diagnostic test for the GED in Spanish. This book includes simple and concise explanations, practice problems with answers and chapter tests."
4,Good CD,"This CD is the return of Helloween to Metal, but Andi Deris is far, very far behind Michael Kiske. Michael Kiske Is GREAT."
3,Just okay :(,"I was really excited to get this book- with all the great reviews and the lovely picture on the cover, I was just sure I'd love it. Unfortunately I've gotta give it only 3 stars because it was really just an okay book in my opinion. I had been hoping for a book with some unique and fresh ideas along with tips and advise on installation and various DIY tidbits. It's simply not in there! There are pictures that are colorful and well taken but not much of anything that I haven't seen before in many other books. There's minimal advise on how to accomplish the presented looks; and no explanations are even offered for the reasoning behind why they did things the way they did. If you're not looking for fresh ideas and aren't particularly interested in learning how to recreate designer looks, this book may work for your purposes. It's really more of just a picture book to inspire you rather than explain much of anything."
4,great price for a very adequate book,"Book arrived quickly, a few pages were folded but book otherwise seemed new, purchase process went very smoothly. Much better than spending $19.00 on a new version of this 2005 decorating book that is now dated."
1,Extremely disappointing,"Considering the other reviews, I was extremely disappointed in this book. The best design is the somewhat anemic looking lounge on the front cover. The book covers many over decorated rooms that just look ridiculous and old fashioned. I even checked the publishing information to check I hadn't ordered a 1980s copy in error. Save your money. Buy something that has some relevance to designs of 2010."
5,Indispensable,"This set is indispensable for anyone who seriously wants to have a complete Mozart collection. It contains every symphonic work written by Mozart, including second versions of certain late symphonies.The playing is ""alive"" and fresh, the sound is full, warm and clear. What you get is not Hogwood's ""interpretation""...but music and just the music, this guy understands Mozart and just lets these musicians play with joy, spontaneity, meaning and feeling. I didn't think they would be so good! There are times when you don't even notice that they're playing on period instruments.This set is completely satisfying and I'm glad I own it. It's a pricy box set, but totally worth it...try to find it used and bask in the glory of Mozart."
5,"Review of ""The house that Karen built""","Brilliantly optimistic . . . heartwrenching, heartwarming. A ""must"" read for everyone who serves Foster children in any capacity. This book is a success story. Karen is succeeding at life, one reframe at a time!Patricia L. LawlessI am a Mother of 2 grown menAnd a Therapeutic Foster parent of four."
4,Good collection Until the 1841 story begins.,"Good quality video.....except for the ""Re-created"" missing episode. Love the end of the 1840 storyline, but not crazy about the final storyline of the show were Barnabas is now Bramwell."
4,Great text in dire need of illustrations,"A well-researched book on the psychology of our living spaces, with practical suggestions for looking around our own homes with fresh eyes. In this way, we can often reconfigure an area so that it better serves its intended function without resorting to expensive remodeling projects. But why on earth are there no illustrations or photos at all? The author describes countless examples of homes across America, both landmark sites (such as Washington's Mount Vernon and Jefferson's Monticello) and homes that could be in our own neighborhoods, but the point she is trying to make is often lost among the words when a simple photo or two would have worked beautifully. I'm holding off on buying this book in hopes that the paperback edition will include the photos that should have been included in the first release."
5,Environmental Psychology,"Fascinating look at how architecture and interior design influence our mood and behavior. You gain general priciples and insights into what makes an space inviting or unappealing. This is a great book for an architect or interior designer with an interest in environmental psychology. This is NOT a ""how to"" book for consumers who want remodeling ideas."
1,Notecard Nonfiction,"I bought House Thinking several months ago when we were getting ready to do some serious remodeling, not as a how-to guide, but for some philosophical perspective. I found it unreadable. It is an example of the genre of Notecard Nonfiction. The way this works is that the wrier has an Idea & then begins Researching, making notes. Composition consists of stitching the notecards together into a sort of endless papyrus of bland observations, mostly from sociologists. Notecard Nonfiction, whatever the subject, relies heavily on sociological observation. It is like David Brooks without the right-wing point of view. Without any point of view. The book as pure consumer object, motivated by nothing deeper than market reserach."
1,Complete Garbage,It can't pump tires on a real bike. It says 115 psi but I can't get 90 out of it. It comes apart easily and feels like a toy. I wish I could send it back but I've waited too long.
2,Larger than expected.,"This bicycle air pump is longer than I expected.The pump is actually 7 inches long and very easy to slide the handle back and forth.It inflates tubes fast for a pump that size.The pressure guage does not work at all.NO DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS on labeled backcard packaging;the first time I attemped to inflate a tire I was unsucessful.I did not TWIST THE ENTIRE DUAL HEAD END OF THE PUMP,TO OPEN THE VALVE,so the air could blow out of it.The instructions say to twist the grey collar to lock.WHAT GREY COLLAR are the instructions on the backcard pertaining to? No lines pointing to the illustration identifying a grey collar that needs to be twisted !"
1,Cra(p)nk Brothers,I bought this pump because I wanted a high quality pump that was reliable. What I got was an expensive weight to carry around in my tool bag. Gauge stopped working within a couple of weeks. Wasn't too long after that and the pump didn't work right. Then it got to the point where it couldn't get any usable pressure in a tire. The thing flies through the air better than it pumps.
2,A salvage pump at best,"PROS: Very light and very sleek. Gauge on pump. High pressure and high volume settings.CONS: This product comes with little in the way of directions, and is not 100% self-explanatory. I took the pump to my local bike store, and one of the technicians there showed me that you need to place the pump onto the valve and *then* twist it to the ""on"" position (with the gauge facing the side of the pump that you are using). With the Schraeder valve side, the pump can put out ~30psi at best before air leaks around the O-ring that keeps the valve in place. Considering that it is a chore to get the pump onto the valve in the first place, this is disappointing. This pump will allow you to get enough air in your tire to get home, but do not expect to get ideal (60-80psi in my case) tire pressure using this pump alone."
1,Cool design - terrible function,"Heavy, clunky, poor mounting. Hard to use. Breaks valves. Impossible to reach high pressures. Get a pump with a hose. The end."
1,Poorly made product,"This is a poorly made product. The air pressure gauge did not work. The gauge read 20psi when the tire was actually at 60psi. Don't trust it! And I'm not sure why they chose to call it a ""Power"" pump...it's nothing of the kind. If you get a flat, you're gonna be pumping a looonnngggg time before you get back on the road."
2,Doesn't work well,"It really disappointed me to use this pump, had it in my backpack waiting for the right time to use it, and when it came, I was pumping for aprox. 7 minutes until my arms start to feel numb, only to get my MTB tire semi inflated.Great exterior design, but the the pump itself is not what it should."
5,Sophie and Sam Are So Cool!,"Sophie is like my best friend - funny, smart, and crazy about nail polish and boys.I would be scared if I ran away from home, like she did, and didn't know anyone - but she's not scared, she's a heroine! Her new life in the weird mid-west is an adventure. I love Sophie & can't wait for the next book!"
5,Wonderful second book in the Missing Persons series.,"The Shattenberg sisters, Sophie and Sam, are settling into their new lives and new identities in Venice, Indiana, all the while hoping their past won't catch up with them. Sophie has just started at her new high school and Sam has a job working for a local private detective. When they meet Leo Shattenberg, a professor at a local college, they wonder if he might be a long-lost relative. While they try to find out if they are related to Leo, the sisters take on a new missing persons case, searching for Leo's long lost love, Ruth Brauner, who disappeared in 1947, and who may be connected to the theft of Holocaust artwork.This book was a wonderful continuation of the Missing Persons series. Sophie's chatty narrative adds charm and wit to the book. I highly recommend this series to teen readers, whether they are mystery fans or not."
2,not the greatest - but serviceable,thought it was different than what I received - liked the photos thoughgood price though for the item
5,Magnificent Bedtime Story for All Ages,"Dreams make the world go round. Whether they're daydreams, or dreams that you have when you sleep. A little boy decides that he wants to delay going to bed, so he uses his wonderful imagination to dream up many different dream scenarios to tell his Mother about, before succumbing to the inevitable, and falling asleep and entering his very own dream.I adore bedtime stories. I have since I was very young, and WHAT IF... is one of the best that I have ever seen. The prose is delightful, and will quickly lull your child to sleep when bedtime comes, while the illustrations are utterly magnificent, and will have your child in awe. If you are going to buy one bedtime story to last a lifetime, this should be it.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"
3,Partial Race for the Cup 2008,"This DVD was at the top of my Christmas List. In past years I have asked for and enjoyed the Winston 2002 and 2003 and the Nextel 2004 and 2005 and Chase For the Championship 2006 and 2007 and was so looking forward to the same type of format which would show interviews and commentary from the entire season. This format is the 10 cup races..period. The only direct interviews are with the winner and maybe with the runner up and very short. If you missed the races and want to see the races.........this is fine. If you want to learn about the entire season, then I think it will disappoint. It is the 10 cup races which seems to me to present the idea that the whole season is the last 10 races."
2,Beautiful but non-functional,This bottle opener is beautiful but function does not follow form in this case. The edges along the business end of the opener are two thick/blunt and cannot easily get up under the edge of a typical bottle cap. It takes at least two and some times three to four movements to get a bottle cap off. The thing simply slips off most times. It's a beautiful thing; I'm really disappointed that it just doesn't work. Nice paperweight anyway.
4,Unearthing the woman within the mythology.,"Ms. Painter does a complete job of culling an abundance of information and ascertaining the real Sojourner Truth from the mythologized one who has been passed down to most of us by way of cursory teaching and mentioning of in classrooms. This scholarly book is rife with interesting and, at times, disturbing facts about not only the woman named Sojourner, but also about the country named America with its racist and sexist policies and practices.The book is written in a clear and cohesive style, notwithstanding its rigorous documentation. Anyone who is interested in African American history, women's history, and U.S. history will want to have a copy of Sojourner Truth, A Life, A Symbol in his or her library."
3,Main characters too stubborn,"I'll give Kell credit for not thinking the worst of Beth. Maybe misogynist heroes are on the way out. The gentle heroine (an animal caretaker) also makes this book different. As does the strong impact of the setting.However, once it comes to love, this book hits a brick wall. The hero doesn't believe in love. And the heroine waivers back and forth. She wants to be with the hero, she wants to go back to her farm, she wants to... You get the picture.And what did she she in her former fiance Lyle in the first place!I gave this book a C- at All About Romance."
4,Good! But...,"This is terrific for holding your tripod stable, and allowing you to move it easily. Here are my pros and cons for this product:Pros:SturdySteelEasy to lock tripod legs inFolds and easy to storeMake moving tripod around a breezeGreat for panning shots over super-smooth surfacesCons:Don't try moving shots over anything bumpier than smooth glassWish wheels had a little more give so that every bump isn't transferred to the camera; maybe something like urethaneThe price changes are all over the map!That's about it for the cons, but not being able to do panning shots is a big disappointment. However, the portability *almost* makes up for it.In summary, get it for its construction, but be careful about the surfaces you want to roll over while shooting. Your videos will look like you're nervous."
3,Good for the price,I haven't messed with it a ton but in my preliminary shooting tests I found that this product was decent. I say this because I do not have carpet but wood flooring and every crack seemed to cause a shake when moving. Lucky for me I am finishing my basement and have some floor padding that I think will resove this...but I paid $20+ for that. On Kitchen tile it seems fine.The wheels and setup before you start pulling have to be planned or it goes out of control...but that is just something you have to get used to...Once all these things were in place I did get a nice smooth roll inside.
4,it has wheels it rolls,"It is what it is cheap, inexpensive, it has wheels it rolls, what do you want. It works. Go for it !"
3,"For video, use only on the smoothest floors","We were looking for a cheap way to shoot some dolly shoots. The tiniest imperfection of the floor transmits to the camera and vibrates same. One of our guys is trying to adapt fat, soft, wheels to this to see if that modification will improve things."
3,Hypoallergenic and 'latex free' are two different things,"Hypoallergenic and 'latex free' are two different things- I am allergic to the adhesive on the tape- our local drug store was out of the hypoallergenic bandaids so I bought these on line as I was running out while dealing with a wound-- sadly, I can not use them, even though I need them urgently, I will have to drive around tomorrow to find bandaids that I can use without my skin falling off.The box looked like someone re-taped it shut after being opened...They are probably good bandaids, but the description needs to clearly state that they are latex free vs. hypoallergenic."
1,I wish i could give 0 stars...,"I have to confess that I did not finish this movie. I couldn't sit through the thing, it was absolutely painful. I have many problems with the film but I will concentrate on the most glaring error. In all of the Pimpernel books, Sir Percy manages to get the aristocrats out of France in all sorts of witty and devious ways. None of these ways include running into the room in front of the guards and fighting out. Also, in all the books I've read, the people who are helping Percy are never caught. Some are even unaware that they are helping the Scarlet Pimpernel. It would have been nice if the movie sort of followed the books, but it didn't."
1,Buy the 1930's version instead,"Our entire family read the book and then decided to watchthe video. I ordered both the 1930s version and this versionby A&E. I thought this version might be better due to it'slength and recent making. I was sadly mistaken.The 1930's video, though dated, had superb acting andfollowed the story-line of the book almost entirely.I didn't even recognize the plot in this version, it differedso much from the book...including characters. Then when theyhad a sex scene in the first 15 minutes, I decided that thisvideo was fit for the trash (where it went). The littleI watched did not follow the plot and it was not suitable forfamily viewing."
4,Lighten up!,"In one of the other reviews somebody wrote that if you like the Anthony Andrews ""Pimpernel"" you'll hate this version. WRONG!!!! I loved the Anthony Andrews version, and I really, thoroughly enjoy this version! Can these critical people say ""entertainment""? This is just entertainment, not grand art. I love both versions, and I am very grateful that somebody decided to make this one. As for Richard Grant not being leading man material, rubbish! He does a great job. And if he doesn't generate any heat for you, well, perhaps you're the ones with the problem!"
1,The WORST pimpernel ever!!,"I give these movies NEGATIVE stars, they are so awful. Even if we forget for the whole duration of these films that they IN NO WAY resemble the Orczy books AT ALL, they would *still* be bad movies. There is almost no coherency or plot in the entire movie. The script is trite and uninteresting. The acting is sub par and the ""characters"" (if you can call them that) do not evoke any empathy at all...."
1,The Scarlet Pimpernal Box Set,"Well, I haven't seen the series yet but I have been reading sme which sounds sad. Richard E. Grant is a great actor but being the lead in his movies was never his strong point. I liked him in the film Jack and Sarah co- starring with Samantha Mathis. They had that spark in the movie that made it wonderful. I would love to see Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews come and make a series of The Scarlet Pimpernal. It would be great because they had that spark that made the whole movie. Watch it today you would love it."
3,Percy? Give me more of Shove Along!,"Grant's Percy is certainly a bite out of Leslie Howard's apple. But, for me, the scenes between him and Martin's Shaw's ""Shove Along"" are the gems. Shaw brings a smoldering quality to his role I've not seen before.That kept me interested. Still does."
2,Need newer version with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour!,"This is one of my very favorite stories--a real adventure and love story that has plenty of surprises. Unfortunately, this making of the Scarlet Pimpernel is dry and played without passion on the political, adventurous, AND romantic scenes.I would love to have the newer version with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour. It's a great flick that is also good for a ""Blockbuster Night"" with your significant other."
4,fun,"I found I enjoyed this video series. Richard E. Grant, made Percy come alive, with his sly wink and a nod. I would hope that this series will continue, if only American television was this fun!"
4,Our son loves this book!,"Our son loves this book. Plenty of different things to learn. Some content is a little dated, but he's been requesting this book every night since Christmas."
4,Cute,I only gave 4 stars because I was expecting a story book and his was more like a picture dictionary. Not for my 4 year old but worth it for younger kids. The price is pretty decent.
2,Warning: Does Not Teach You How To Fly,"I am an avid person when it comes to flight and I have a passion for being free as a bird. But a few weeks ago I passed by my local book store and saw in the window this very same book. Little did I know that this book would lead me to my demise. But I was so eager to learn so much from this book about learning how to fly that I raced home to read it! After finishing the book I believed I was ready to test my new flight skills. So I went up to the top of my appartment building to take flight; little did I know that i would not fly away but ended up hitting the street with such force that I fractured my skull, broke three ribs and my left arm, and shattered my pelvis. So I must warn you all that this book will not give you wings or teach you how to fly but I haven't given up hope and will continue my search for a way to finally fly!I give this book a 2 Stars out of 5 for being a great read and false advertisement."
2,Boring and hardly original,"After all the gushing praise I had heard for this book, the actual story was a major yawner. Essentially, there's A Lot Of Miscommunication that results in a Farce, uh, I mean, Epic Battle. Really, this read like one of those Frasier episodes where anyone with sense would have spent two minutes ironing our a misconception or two and the whole thing would have been resolved happily, but instead, a comedy of errors leads to farcical misadventures.YAWN.If this book challenges your ideas about the War In Heaven, then you haven't given it any thought at all. I've seen the idea done much better and with a much tighter, interesting story than ""Gee, I'm just going to go kill a bunch of people instead of opening a simple line of communication!"" Heck, go read something by Gaiman instead (Sandman or Books of Magic).Two stars - one for the fact that at least I got through it, even if I was wondering why I bothered."
4,"a fine, ignored chronicle","This short, well-written novel, with its deathless themes and strong characters, remains clear in mind though I read it 2 years ago.Hard SF fans will not be pleased if that is what they seek, but those enjoying fine fiction will be rewarded. Highly suitable travel book."
2,Don't Bother,"As I write this review, this book is showing an average rating of 4 stars. I have no idea how that can be. The premise is interesting: a SciFi interpretation of the creation of Heaven and Earth and the Fall. But, you can just feel the author trying to cram the plot in to fit the established framework. There's also almost nothing in the book which talks about WHY the characters are acting as they do. Mostly, it's about WHAT they do and isn't it clever how it meshes with the accepted interpretation. Since most of what the characters are doing is pretty sophomoric, having a better idea of their motivations is essential. Some of the anthropomorphisms are absurd, too (i.e., assuming pre-Earth angels would act as we do, make things of steel, and light their homes with torches is ridiculous).Since I rate this book at a mere 2 stars out of 5, I'd say that if you want to read it, get it from the library and save yourself a bundle."
1,Awful fiction,"Seriously, did someone even edit this thing? So, Satan, who is not the same as Lucifer, is talking in ""Elizabethan"" English at first, then just a bit later, he's using modern speech. He doesn't even attempt to go back into Elizabethan when Beelzebub continues to speak to him in that fashion. And why would they speak differently if they were both living in the same lifetime?The owl, Ariel, could have been funny speaking in couplets had those couplets actually been well-structured or if Brust had presented them as purposely ridiculous.Ugh! This whole book was just such a mess of potentially good ideas utterly destroyed. I feel like this book is the result of a tragically long chain of people going along with Brust because they felt bad telling him his story was awful, and we got stuck with an absolute joke of a tale so full of plot holes, bad dialogue, and lackluster characters that should only be found on an obscure fantasy fan fiction website.PUKE"
1,Junk,"Worthless, unengaging piece of trash, equal to his other works. Fortunately, I didn't pay for this one; I got it at the library. Do yourself a favor and bite your tongue really hard. It'll give you about the same amount of pleasure as this book."
1,pathetic atempt at a novel,when i start a book i finish it.A mistake with this book.Dont read this satanic devil worship novel
5,Pratchett + Dante + impeccable timing = Brust,"The revolt in heaven as told from all perspectives, this book is written at two levels - one for entertainment purposes, and another as a ""historical"" lesson. When one can see an issue from all sides, one is more enlightened. Plus, it cracked me up!Pratchett + Dante + impeccable timing = Brust"
2,Huh?,"I'm more than a little taken aback by the gushing reviews over this book. At best it's a mildly diverting fantasy story -- an attempt at constructing a mythology that falls more than a little short of the classic old myths. Yet many readers seem to view the book as a life-altering experience. Well, I guess you ""get it"" or you don't. I don't."
2,It's just not that good,"I don't for the life of me see how all of these reviews could be giving this 5 stars. The review comparing it to a 3's Company episode is much more accurate.How is it that one minor angel mangages to fool all of the top angels and just happen to be in the right place so many times? Very weak plot line! I don't see where the imagination is other that the setting which is fleshed out quite well.For about the first 1/4 of book I was exicited about the story due to the setting, but once Brust started down his plot line I got more and more frustrated. I really did not enjoy this book.Notice that most of the 5 star reviews all mention ""don't lend out this book"", I suspect that there is a single person who is writing most of these. That must be it... there can't be this many people who really believe this is a great book!!"
5,execellent,"this was a nice surprise. usually books about biblical matters are repetitive and boring, but brust masterfully weaves intrigue and life into each and every character. there is no good or evil, only each individual's personal intentions. this is an execellent book and any fan of brut's previous works should read it."
5,Brust's take on the Genesis prequel,Brust is such an accoplished author that he made Satan a sympathetic character in this book. This is my favorite book from my favorite author. I buy extra copies every so often since I'm always giveing this book to friends.
5,Good Information,I really found this book to provide very helpful information since I am really considering locs. It is an easy read.
5,Excellent presentation,"Very well written. Really makes you think about whether or not you want to do this; but does not scare you off from it. Raises your awareness of all aspects of the process/procedure, both good and bad."
4,"Too Short, But Sweet","Lonnice Brittenum Bonner writes useful books on natural hair care, and her style is informative and concise. The problem is that her books are too concise for me. Far from expecting a treatise on dreadlocks, I only wanted a comprehensive guide for care and styling of ""nice dreads."" I found her edicts wanting for elaboration, and her statements (i.e. ""...coal tar is a suspected carcinogen) begging for attribution (which agency suspects the coal-tar threat?).Nitpicking aside, ""Nice Dreads"" delivers just what its subtitle promises: ""Hair Care Basics and Inspiration...."" If you are considering locks as part of your hair journey, then there is no other book as engaging, humorous, and full of useful tips as ""Nice Dreads."" Perhaps Ms. Brittenum Bonner has earned her right to be concise. She already has a loyal following of natural-hair divas and hopefuls. Count me as one."
3,Dreds Basics,"Good overview for starting dreds. A tad petty in the beginning about her hair texturizer vs. a hair relaxer. Not many photos, not a ""style"" book. You could actually get all this infomation over the net, but handy all the same if you don't know your real natural hair."
2,It's Mostly Inspiration,"I was very disappointed in the lack of information about starting and maintating locs. It seems that the author wrote this book based entirely on her own experience and figures that the was she started and maintains her hair is the only way, and that is just not true. If you want a book for inspiration in growing locs, buy this book! However, if you want to find information about the different ways of growing and maintaing locs, don't by this book (in fact, I returned it to the store). You'll be better off doing your own research on the internet."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!,"I made the mistake of buying this book. First, it is not a book, when my order came I thought I was sent an empty box! Secondly, these aren't stories, these are beginnings of stories (one or two sentences doesn't constitute a story!). Lastly, the writing is not all that good. I went to many book stores trying to find this book, now I know why they didn't carry it!"
4,Novel Concept for Short Stories,"This is an amazing collection of really short stories-all set in New York City-that stand on their own, but if you read them all a whole, it's like an arc out of a strange, hip novel that gets made into a film you'd see at the Angelica. Heather Holland Wheaton has a knack for putting a lot into a few words. The characters (that you'd only see in New York City) are vivid and real. As if they were standing right next to you on the subway and reading over your shoulder. And their concern with the mundane, and pursuit over the trivial fixings of urban life and their seemingly simultaneous New York moments all have a dark and witty humor to it. They speed along in the city, in and out of the same restaurants, bodegas, and cabs having these subtle influences on each other's lives and not knowing it. Imagine Raymond Carver writing episodes of Sienfeld."
4,A Fly in your Matzoh Ball Soup!,"Slices of Life Pie. Snippets of urban culture, set in the greatest city in the world!This little gem fullfills my voyeuristic fantasy of being a fly on the wall, or a fly in the matzoh ball soup of everyday New Yorkers. Ms. Wheaton has such a knack for capturing the idiosynchrasies of her characters, and the most minutae of details, that you'd swear you know some of these people.People who love or loathe this city for whatever reason.I chuckled a few times out loud on the A train home while absorbed in their lives.The best part of some these not so simple short stories (after all, life is complex!), is that they don't always have an ending.You can use your imagination to fill in the blanks, as I do, wandering around manhattan, mulling the millions of lives that are so randomly planted in this multi cultural mecca. I catch up weekly by going to the authors website and reading more new stories posted every week! Who says nothing in life is free? You gotta go there! ..."
4,snapshots of NY,"Super cute! These fast-paced vingettes capture the buildings, bodegas, Chinese takeout delivery men and dogwalkers of NYC. I felt like I was voyeouristically peering at my neighbours across the air shaft. Perfect pocket-size - read a story or two while waiting in line for your dry-cleaning, at the post office, or between subway stops. Frenetic, sometimes abrupt and teeming with quickly sketched characters, Heather's written the equivalent of getting a knockwurst sandwich at Katz's deli."
2,More of an exercise than real literature,"I have a great appreciation for short literature, but stories should have conflicts with resolutions that matter, characters that leave impressions, and climaxes. Ideally. The stories should also be written with correct grammar. Minimally. These stories lack all of the above. This collection reads like a series of assignments given to high school creative writing classes. Most of these stories are just a good start, but not a satisfying finish. The characters don't ring true in some stories; in others, they just don't have enough depth. Ultimately, it's a short, easy to carry text but a frustrating, irksome read."
4,A must-have for an outdoors visitor to the N. GA Mountains.,"This book provides in-depth descriptions of locations throughout the North Georgia Mountains. The authors have paid particular attention to details that lead you off the mainstream ""touristy"" trails and onto the real Georgia. This book is a ""must-have"" for campers and day-hikers so you can plan your next trip. Accurate topographic maps are included along with directions to trail heads and other sites."
3,A little stiff,This pillow case is a little stiff and makes that crinkly noisy sound ever so slightly. I prefer my all cotton allergan pillow case.
2,Only one cover included in package,"This product seems to work fine, however I was under the impression that it was a package of 4 as shown in the picture, so please note it is only one cover included."
5,preserve your new pillows,sleep with excellent protection for your pillow. These protectors have asilky feel in the material and are odor free which is important to me. Ifyou are chemically sensitive i recommend zip and block encasing for you totry. The quality of material and construction is excellent and it's affordable.
5,Funk n' Blues,Swamp Cabbage is as original deep south blues band as any I've ever heard. Funky catchy riffs with superb lyrics and vocals. They are tight in rhythm together and make you want to get up and groove. If you like your blues with a funky bass line you will really like this group and this cd.
3,OK,"not impressed, but it's OK, it has descriptions how to draw your mandalas. don't know if it's working, some time is needed to spend on this"
3,Ok,"This item doesn't do much for me. The fabric is pretty boring looking after you see it in person. The actual heat pad aspect seems adequate but as it is a gift, I haven't used it on anything hot."
5,Amazing book,This book is simply amazing! I'm from South America and it is impossible to buy this book here. For all typography lovers and specially for students specializing in typography it is a must have.
2,contact Vet before using.,This collar basicly melted the hair off my cat's neck in under 24hours.I took her to vet and she had a bad reaction to it.looks like its on to finding about collar she can use.
1,Chemical burns around the neck,"This product is terrible, and this company should be shut down. I used this flea collar on my 7 month old cat. Only after 3 days did we notice that he had absolutely no fur around his neck due to chemicals in the collar as well as chemical burns from the collar.After further research, this company has nothing but a bad reputation. Avoid this company of anything they sell at all costs. Simply despicable."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!! SAFETY ISSUES!!!,"After only 2 DAYS, just 2, I noticed that all the the fur under the collar was GONE! Its supposed to stay on for 7 months and just two days in there was only skin left. I looked up the same product and it seems like a LOT of pet owners have seen negative effects from using this and other Hartz products. DO NOT BUY THEM."
4,Good Collar,I purchased two of these collars for my 2 cats. My boys haven't had any adverse reactions to this collar. They have had their collars on for about 2 months. Now my one cat did get outside without his collar( it was after a bath on memorial day weekend) He did come home with a few fleas. I quickly bathed him and slapped his collar back on him so hopefully that will take care of any lingering fleas and eggs. All in all a good collar.
1,This mess almost killed my cat!,This crap slowly poisoned my cat! Over a months time it had seeped into my poor cat. Slowly poisoning him! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! We are still not sure if he will survive :(
1,Caused wounds on my cat's neck!,"My cat has never had fleas, but I bought this because he goes outside a few times a day and came home with a tick once. When I put it on I made sure it wasn't too tight. I never even realized until after he wore it for 3 weeks that the underside of his neck was oozing and scabbed. I treated the wound with Neosporin and it healed in about 3 days, but now he has hair missing all on the bottom of his neck!! DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR CAT."
2,Collar doesn't seem to work so well.,"After almost a month, it'd appear that the cat still has fleas, though we keep finding dead ones on the cat, she also has scabby skin from scratching and biting herself.the 3-in-1 seems to be much more effective in discouraging the fleas and keeping them off the animals than the collar does even though the collar will eventually kill the buggers."
4,"Good, Cheap Radio","It's pretty durable (we drop them quite a lot at work and they keep on a working), simple to use (the more expensive ones have all those options you never use), OK range (2 miles real world or inside a factory), OK battery (the rechargeable batteries we use usually last an entire shift if we don't transmit that much), and it's CHEAP!!! Much cheaper than those other radios with the SAME wattage.I'm only writing this because it's a pretty good way to keep in touch with my five year old daughter and three year old son when they are out and about the neighborhood. It's simple enough for my son and daughter to use. I don't let my son take one much because I know he'll lose it.Final thoughts: This is the only radio I would buy because the more expensive ones are just a waste of money in most cases."
3,Reasonable for camping and away from crowds,"I like the rugged radio. I broke one, when it fell from top of a ladder onto cement. No surprise there. The AA cells last a while, much better than AAA or nicads. Others say the quiet squelch codes are needed for public areas, and I'm sure they are right. I use my FR-50 for picnics. From the table to the fire wood gatherer. Car to car range, less than half a mile. Line of sight. Also at work, when doing work on the roof, or far side of the building. They are short range, but the sound is good. If the operator talks, quietly, and directly into the mic."
4,Motorola TALKABOUT FR50,"Love it! I recently purchased them about a year ago, needing a pair of radios for hunting and emergency use.So far I love them, good amount of channels, amazing distance.In Kent, OH you don't have that problem with all the channels cluttered up. Almost every channel here is empty.Distance is incredible, at least for me.A great radio for beginners."
3,good radio but missing features,the fr50 is a good radio if other people around are not using frs radios. because it does not have any sub channals it is hard to find a clear channal in a buzy area. it also does not have a scan feature. i think getting the fr60 would be a better choice.
3,Only good for outdoors,"It's a cheap motorola radio, nice for outddoor biking, walking, lound and clear voice. The signal is bad when using between buildings (lost of sound occationally, eventhough the distance is a lot less than 1 mile). Baterries consuming rate is high, 20 hours is the STANDBY time not the real talk time (last ~1.5-2 hours if you talk all the times), you should use the rechargable batterirs. The call feature is handy, just like a pager. If you want radios for your kid to play or intend to use in open areas, this is it."
3,Motorola FR50 Talkabout,This unit performed fine. Does not have channel scan feature found in the FR250. Display was not as nice as 250. Size was also slightly larger. Range etc. should be same as FR250.
2,"great music, distractingly drum-heavy performance","I have been a fan of Susato for many many years and was delighted to discover this CD. However it turned out to be somewhat disappointing. Basically, the drums are simply overdone. It sounds like the instruments are meant to accompany the drums, rather than the other way around. Perhaps there is some sort of scholarly argument that can be made about this approach being more historically accurate although I doubt it. The drums are extremely distracting and make most of the pieces sounds more like war-marches than dances. For example, the version of ""Il etait une fillette"", rather than suggesting a young woman curious about love, conjurs up images of the german Wehrmacht getting ready to invade Poland!"
3,"Music is great, but....","The music is all I wanted it to be, but the sound quality is frustrating. The volume varies with each piece, so I am constantly needing to turn the knob up and down, which detracts from the fantastic music on the CD. The Krummhorns sound a little tinny, but that was my instrument, and I am particular about their quintessential buzz."
3,It's okay,"I didnt realize this is tear out notes from this book. Which is nice, and easy. I thought it might be more list? Or nice little ideas to put in a child lunch box. I would debate buying it agian."
4,Good for hooking things,It fits in the receiver and things will hook on it. What an amazing product!
4,Herbs for Sale,"I bought this book also off of Amazon.com and it is a wonderful book with great sugesstions. It is a little complicated, though, and I at times had to read a paragraph more than once to understand it. Otherwise, it is a good book."
2,Insidious or Hideous?,"Hoping the band would improve over time, listening to this CD shows something's do not improve with time. The smooth but haunting vocals are interesting at first, but after a while are so repetitive it becomes dreadful and repugnant. The lyrics get more boring song after song, almost childish and funny. Goth is so much more than this revolting impersonation of other bands. I am still trying to decide if I should use it as a coaster or a sleeping aide. They sound like they were asleep during the writing and performing. This is not Goth at its best, this is Goth at rest. A couple of the early recordings are much better. This is a CD that is coasting by on hopes that someone will think it is Goth."
3,not satisfied,"I had to return this item. The reason being is the following. I enquired within Amazon abouth the specific recording time for GREETINGS. The employee suggested I call GE directly. I did. I was told I could use any amount of the total 30 minutes allowed for recording GREETINGS. It proved to be wrong. When I received the item, the user guide specificaly states TOTAL RECORDING TIME FOR GREETINGS...30 SECONDS. Disappointed, I returned the item today.Johnny"
2,worked okay for about 2 years,"This was a fine cheap answering machine for about two years. Then anytime we used the phone attached to it, we'd get horrible static on the line, and only playing with the wire connecting it to the answering machine would help, although sometimes it would just disconnect the call. It does seem to miss calls on occasion. It wasn't the worst one I've had, but we got this one really cheap, and you get what you pay for on this one."
1,Piece of junk!,"Our AT&T 1718 started to have sound drop out issues after 5 years of use. I did some research and did not find any available machines on the market that were rated much better than average. In the meantime, my better half decided that we needed to get a new machine right away and she purchased this GE 29875 from W-mart for 15 bucks. Hooked it up and tried it out. This thing would only record a message when it felt like it and when it did record the message the volume dropped in and out so bad that you were lucky to catch every third word. Needless to say we returned it for a refund. I decided to dig up my 25 year old Panasonic cassette phone recorder from the basement and it still works fine, although clumsier to use. So much for product advancement! Don't buy that piece of junk from GE."
1,Hate this machine,"I also have the problem that other users mentioned. I bought the machine at Wal Mart and have set it up so many times, I'd like to toss it out the window. I have had several messages cut off in mid stream. After checking the instructions, I found that the maximum recording time is 60 seconds and there is no way to increase that time. I have also called home & left messages for myself only to find that they never recorded because I hit the maximum time before disconnecting."
5,Great Experience,Our answering machine died and we looked for another one just like it. The one we found was exactly like the one we had and we are very happy with the Digital Messaging System. It came quickly and was exactly as advertised. We will buy from this vendor again. It's easy to find things on the Amazon site!
2,GE 29875GE1 Degital Messaging System,"I bought this machine for my 84yr old Grandfather who has difficulties with seeing and hearing. I tried to find a machine that had all the important controls centralized,which this one did. My Grandfater cant tell the difference between the number 0 or 3 on the machine. So most of the time he thinks he does not have messeages.When he deletes a messeage he ends up turning the machine off because the earase and ON/OFF are the same button. But i cant get that through his 84yr old mind.If this machine was used for a family without elders it would be fantastic. But this is diffiently not one for the elders."
2,"Works, but has a usability issue","Bought this at Walmart for my mother. It works, however the functional design is poor because the on/off button is a multifunction push button that does other things too besides turn the machine on/off, meaning someone might turn the machine off by accident and not know it because it is STILL LIT UP, giving the appearance that it is on when in fact if is off. So they think it's on, but nobody can leave a message b/c it's actually turned off."
2,Very simple and at times hard to understand playback,"Bought this...very easy to set up..thought good deal.It worked one week.The other messages stopped playing and died after the person said, ""Hello this is.."" Frustrated the callers! So I purchased another one. It at least works, but if someone is not speaking clearly, it may not have good playback quality. Also, you may hear other parties if your phone (landline) is plugged into the unit and you make a call..it isn't your phone..it is the unti. But for the price, and for needing a cheap answering machine, it works."
5,the greatest answering machine ever!,"This answering machine is great, easy to install, if you don't want to record your personal message, it already has one available, it's great, please buy the answering machine, this is the one!"
1,"piece of junk, need I say more?","This is a complete and utter waste of money. It won't even work!!!!!! I have reset it over and over and it cuts off my outgoing message and won't even record a message at all from anyone who calls. It simply does not work, A PIECE OF JUNK, NEED I SAY MORE!!!"
1,Early Failure,"After only four months of light use, this device failed. It cuts off the incoming message after only a few seconds."
1,Really disappointing.,"I think I purchased this machine less than a year ago, mostly because of the GE Brand, which has meant quality to me and my family for generations. It was fairly easy to use, but a pain to re-set the date/time stamp all the time as I live in a rural area where it's not unusual to lose power. The biggest problems I had were a) poor recording quality -- Messages were very difficult to understand, and B) messages are regularly cut off during recording if the person speaking wasn't talking VERY LOUDLY. I'm talking dropped calls when people were speaking in a normal tone of voice. I buy products to last, and to do their job well. I'm unimpressed with this one and will be avoiding GE in the future."
2,Cuts people off,"This machine cuts people off at random. It doesn't matter that I've set the message length to 4 minutes, if the caller speaks loudly or if the caller doesn't take any pauses. The machine randomly cuts off about 1 in 5 callers!"
5,A Lot More To This Video Than Meets the Eye,"At first glance one would expect this video to be of no interest whatsoever except to maybe the students of Dr. Yang, I mean seriously, who would want to sit down and watch almost six (6) hours of a retrospective on a martial arts instructor and his publishing business? Well let me tell you something, I would and so will you once you see all the truly remarkable demonstrations of Chinese martial arts that are presented over a 25 year period and involving some of the greatest practitioners of the Chinese martial arts in the last 100 years.I really found myself speechless as I watched this video and all of these really eye-opening demonstrations that were being given and then hearing the truly remarkable Dr. Yang talk about his humble beginnings and his dream of building YMAA into what it is today and what it is going to be tomorrow. Owning this video is like owning a great piece of martial arts history.Shawn KovacichCreator of numerous books and DVD's."
3,A nice introduction to many different areas,"It's a very nice book, with beautiful illistrations. It is a great way to jump into many different areas of psychic phenomena. It includes several different quizes to help you figure out in what areas you have inate talents. I enjoyed reading it. However, it is not a book that you will often pick up once you've read it. What it provides is a great introduction to different areas. What it does not provide is any depth into the different areas. That being said it is still worth the price."
4,A comprehensive TASTER book!,"I just finished reading this book, and I am glad I bought it!If you are looking for an indepth book on psychicism, this is NOT the one. However, if you are just starting to investigate/read on the subject, then this book is a great place to start. It covers so many related subject headings and gives a taste of each, just enough for you to decide whether you'd like to research a specific subject further or not.The book is certainly thought-provoking and it could actually help guide your next readings on the subject."
1,How Corny Is This Book?,"I believe in a lot of the topics in the book and Julie Soskin did a nice job introducing every topic there is. It is nicely layed out, but VERY brief and corny. For example, one of the eight questions for Rating your pet's ESP is Does your dog howl or hide during a seance or other psychic happening? I was excited to go through this book, but ended up extremely disappointed. The worst part is I lost the receipt and can't take it back!"
4,How Psychic Are You?,It was good. I only wished it had more on Meditation & how that connects with the various methods
3,How Psychic Are You?,Easy to understand and doesn't go into much depth. This book would be fine for a beginner who knows nothing about psychic powers and doesn't want to learn too much more. Very basic.
4,Very Helpful and Fun,This book to my surprise has been very helpful and I use it more like a work book rather than reading it from front to back. Everyone has different strengths and may only need to use a couple of chapters. I use it alot as reference and it helped me get a grasp on subjects I didnt understand such as what chakras and aura's were all about. The book is colorful and easy to understand and the exercises are fun and practical. The questions & answer sections are also very cool. You can learn alot from this book.If you are just opening yourself up to what your potential psychic insights are then I would get this book to tell you where your strengths are.
5,Avery labels,"For my money, I always pick Avery products. They are predictably dependable. This particular set of shipping labels is exactly what I needed. I've been doing quite a lot of shipping from home lately and it is so easy to print labels from my home computure, call the post office and have them pick up my parcels. And these Avery labels are just the ticket."
4,Avery Shipping Labels,"I ordered these labels to use for shippin packages. I use them when I print from various shipping venues, including US Postal Services and they work fine."
4,Great size for shipping,These labels are the perfect size for printing out prepaid ups or usps labels. My biggest challenge is that most prepaid shippers do not send the labels in a format that is easily trasnferred to the template. A little bit of cut and paste is still a more professional look that a printed paper shipping label attached with packing tape.
5,Do Exactly What They're Supposed To Do,"I can't say I jump up and down with excitement when I think about using these labels, but they are pretty good at what they do. They are a half-sheet label and are perfect for printing shipping labels for eBay, USPS, UPS, PayPal, or whatever. The ink doesn't smear, you can't see through them, and they stick well. Just make sure you turn off the ""print receipt"" when you print a shipping label or the shipping receipt info will print on the other label on the sheet. Unless, of course, that's what you want for some reason.Adhesive labels are a zillion times better than printing labels on plain paper, cutting them out, and taping or pasting them onto the box. In terms of time and aggravation saved these labels are worth every penny!"
2,They do not stick well,"I'm almost done with a pack of these and they definitely need taping to keep them secured to a box. Other than that, they separate fine and do not jam my laser printer."
3,Nice labels but hard to find templates,"The labels are fine, though I find that there are no available templates for most word processors out there. It wasn't all that difficult to make one, of course, but this note is just to let users who are not that computer savvy know before buying."
3,Not especially practical.,"I loved the concept of these labels, as I do a lot of online shipping. The half-sheet sized labels make sense because that's how large the labels are on popular shipping sites such as UPS.com and USPS Click-n-ship. However, it is not possible to print just a half sheet of paper from the shipping sites because they are un-editable PDF files. Therefore you must print out a full-sheet worth of text (mainly redundant 'shipping instructions') thus wasting the 2nd label on the other side of the sheet. Overall a nice label product but you might as well buy the more widely available full-sheet labels."
4,Do not use on Laser Jet Printers,"Picked these up myself, but quickly found that they are not compatible with laser jet printers. If you are in the same situation, I would advise returning them ASAP.Luckily, Amazon sells the same shipping labels for laser printers at the best price I've found (pack of 200). (Search: ""avery 5126 laser"" on Amazon)Otherwise, these labels are great for shipping Paypal and USPS shipments."
3,"bright white, good printing quality, do as they say but don't adhere well","This product is great at covering up ""what you stick it on top of"" such as other labels or previous use of boxes, but a big ""however""... It's pretty rare that I put a shipping label on top of something that needs covered up so badly that I need this product. For me, the quality of the permanent adhesion is more important, and in this case I wasn't all that thrilled.Don't get me wrong-- if you have a problem of items below your labels showing through and causing problems, these are perfectly acceptable. For me, they were not the best choice because every label I put on something I felt uncertain if it would stay on during USPS toting and tossing it across the country. So I had to put clear tape around the edges on most packages. Some of the less expensive ""thinner"" labels don't cause me that concern as their thinness and adhesion seems more solid"
5,The best labels I've used yet for USPS,I tried the cheaper labels but these are worht spending a little more. Printed fine right from the usps web site on my 2005 HP printer. I did not install the Avery templates.
5,"excellent product, exactly what you need for internet postage","I re-use boxes for shipping, which means I have to black out markings and rip off old labels. When I first used an Avery label, I had no idea that they were specifically designed to block out the previous label, so I blacked it out as usual with a marker and put the Avery label over it. I was surprised to see that very little of the big black block underneath the label showed through. That's when I finally read the package! These labels are so handy in that regard, because not only do they block out the previous label but they cover up any rips or leftover bits of sticker on the box, making a re-used box look neater. It fit in my printer (a Canon) just right and printed perfectly after I did a single test page for postage. I leave it sitting in the printer for a few minutes and have never had an issue with smeared ink. All in all, these are definitely worth buying if you have internet postage and shipping needs."
5,Works Like A Charm!,"These are very nice shipping labels that worked well with my [...] program. The blocker technology is really nifty too since I sued one of these over top another, very dark label and the underneath label did not show through."
5,A great heavy duty shipping label,"The Avery printer labels with Tru-Block are great. They do just what they say...completely block out the old address label or UPS label so that you can reuse that padded envelope, mailing tube or carton. They run smoothly through the printer and did not jam. My only complaint is that PayPal did not recognize the Avery item number so I had to fudge a little to figure out which number to use. But that was a minor issue and more about PayPal than the labels."
3,The Premium Choice In Labels For Shipping,"As most of you I'm used to Avery labels. I believe them to be the finest quality with most extensive format selection within their niche. With that said, you will pay a premium for the aforementioned attributes. They are the leader and, as such, they generally always cost above other brands...Quite a bit more in some cases than decent generics. However, the quality is consistent and it is very good. This is actually a 5-star product, but due to the cost I must temper it with price paid and downgrade it to 3-stars.These feed and print flawlessly, they are compatible with a myriad of label programs, they stick extremely well in my experience, and they absolutely cover anything they are applied on top of. You cannot ask for more in the product itself, I only wish they were about half the price and I'd likely not quibble at all. With the caveats mentioned they are, even at the premium, price a recommended product if you want the absolute best available."
5,"Prints nicely, hides what is underneath","You can certainly spend less on inkjet labels of this size, but with the Avery, you get nice, thick sheets that print well and don't jam. The TrueBlock feature really does hide what is underneath, unlike most other white label stock. It's worth paying extra for."
5,High quality,I'm sure these will work with whatever printer and software you're used to using for printing shipping labels. The big advantage here is that the label is designed to paste right over any other label on the box and guarantee a scanner doesn't pick up any barcodes from the label below. This way you can reuse boxes without having to try and peel off the old lables. I have no doubt that these will accomplish that. They are so thick not even Superman could see through them!
1,Not as good as it looks,I was so excited to get this for my daughter for Christmas. I had bought her the Alex bathtub stickers and she loved them. These however are junk. They are super thin and rip easily. The clothes do not stick well to the dolls. I think I will contact the company and see if the will replace them with more tub stickers. I would recommend the tub stickers if you are looking for a fun durable bath toy.
1,Doesn't work!,"This bath toy will not stick to anything! We tried it on 2 different real tile surfaces, and a fiberglass tub suround, and it doesn't stick! Of course, at this point we've ""used it"", since we've had the peices in the tub with our child, and the packaging is all ripped up, so we really can't even get our money back. A waste of money."
4,Fun bath toy for preschoolers,"We bought the Alex Fashion in the tub for our 4 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves playing with it. The characters stick to the wall fairly well and the clothes stick to the doll very nicely. The mesh bag hangs easily. I did notice some brown on the backside of some pieces, perhaps from water soaking into the foam? We just opened these a week ago and she's used them twice, so it can't be mildew (doesn't look like it anyway). But it only affects a few of them and only on the backside. Overall, I'm very happy with these and glad we bought them."
5,great bath toy,"My daughter loves these dress-up dolls for the tub. She plays for the longest time & wants everyone to ""do dress-up"" with her. This toy makes a great gift."
3,My daughter was never interested in this toy.,"I had high hopes after seeing other reviews about how much girls liked this toy, but it didn't work out that way at our house. My daughter is pretty ""girly"" but was not really into this toy. She is 2 1/2 right now but still not into it. It is the type of material that encourages kids to chew on it during bathtime too. Plain plastic dolls work much better as bath toys for her. I never really liked that the dolls came with no hair either. The pieces don't always stick super-easy so the little dolls were always bald."
2,Ok,Got this for my girls for Christmas. They barely stick to the wall and there's entirely too many pieces. It's a mess.
1,Not for Adults,"This remote control boat, which I received for X-Mas this year, goes about 2 inches a second. I was expecting something fun to race around the pond behind my apartment. What I got instead was a sluggish, useless, plastic toddler toy."
3,repitch,"I bought this for my 13 yr old grandson, but it was slow enough for my 3 yr old grandaughter, so i took the boat and flipped it over did a modification to the pitch on the propeller .... now it zooms across our pond at a reasonable speed. the rudder control is very weak but it works... battery life wasnt affected by pitch change... still a good first R/C boat for learners"
1,bad,Very bad copy! Missing the final pages and The cover is removed!I'm very disappointed.The item's description is not well made.
4,16 Years of Use,"I bought both Volume I and II when they first came out in the late 1980s and have been using them to find deep sky objects and double stars and to track comets ever since. The only criticism I have is that dozens of errors in the RNGC are reprinted in the original volumes, although some of them may have been cleaned up in later versions. One thing I like is that the bindings are tough and are made to open flat. This, combined with the heavy paper stock, means the books can stand up to quite a bit of field use wear and tear, as mine certainly have over the past nearly two decades."
2,Silly and unrealistic,"I am very disappointed in this book. I really don't appreciate some of the unsavory words that are found throughout its pages. This is my first Nancy Pickard book and I must say that if the rest are this bad, forget it. I recently bought several of her selections and I hope the next will be better, otherwise, I am getting rid of them fast."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"This is quite an excellent book! I got it on Christmas Day. When I began reading, I just couldn't put it down. Todd Strasser has always been good at keeping the attention of his readers. This book is no difference. I would reccommend this book to anybody who likes dogs, technology, or computers."
5,kid's review,The book was really good. I liked it because it was kind of funny and involved a dog. I would recommend it for third grade and up. I don't usually like mysteries but I liked this book.
1,Horribly disappointing; recipes are vague; some will fail,"I was so eager to get this book that I paid to have it sent by 2nd Day Air. But what a disappointment! The recipes are short and vague -- which is fine if you just want to peruse them, but spells disaster if you want to actually make them. For example, the recipe for snow globes doesn't explain that you need a silicone adhesive to prevent the water from dissolving the glue, and that you need non-metallic glitter so it won't rust. The author should have perfected her recipes before rushing to press.Had she taken the time to see how they lasted, and made sure that her directions were very clear, it would have been wonderful. What a disappointment!"
5,Authoritative,"These wonderful recordings of the Haydn symphonies are a testament to the value of using authentic instruments in the performance of music of the classical era--provided they are played by virtuosi directed by an inspired leader, as here. The texture is clearer, the rhythmic momentum greater, and the tonal color more pleasing than was ever possible on 19th century-style instruments. I think Haydn himself would have been awed by these recordings had he been able to hear them.Be sure to snap up the Hogwood/AAM recordings while you can, by buying used or perhaps on German Amazon. Hogwood and his band have been treated shabbily by their recording company, which has discontinued the albums almost as soon as they were released. Indeed, the future of the series is apparently in doubt--a huge shame; after all, Haydn got better with age, and the missing five volumes promise to be the very best. Let's hope the AAM can find a way..."
5,A Joy !!,"LOVE IT!!! My son a hopeful NFL player one day, received these as well for Christmas and loved it!! He has watched them twice already. Good Job Amazon!!"
1,Didn't even hold for more than a week,"My husband installed this Paper towel holder for me as the directions stated, but it didn't hold for more than a week. Now it is sitting in a drawer unused"
5,If you love the romantic hero !,"Go and get this book. The author, Gail Crease, weaves a mystical and romantic tale that truly captivates. The hero, strong, caring, and mysterious is to die for, and the story's setting is as magical--and nautical--as they come. A wonderful writer telling a wonderful story, what more can a reader ask for?"
2,Very Elementary,"Not for anyone who already has a reasonable understanding of writing covered calls. Nothing new here. Most of the book, which is short to begin with, is introductory fluff, appendixes and indexes all geared toward not merely options newbies, but stock market neophytes.I bought this book thinking that there would be more thoroughly detailed covered call writing practices offered, but there was not much there."
2,POOR,TO ELEMENTARY FOR A STOCK TRADER A DUPE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS IF YOU WANT TO LEARN OPTION
1,skimpy and shallow,"The first thing that you'll notice is that this is a skimpy, short book at 134 pages (160 if you include the appendices). This would be ok if the content was substantial and useful. Unfortunately, it provides a very introductory, shallow overview of the covered call writing strategy. This too would be ok if this was a $15 quick read paperback, but it's an expensive hardcover (which is not worth the price). I'd suggest the interested reader should check other books on the subject instead."
3,Not much meat,If you know a thing or two about options don't get this book. It's very elementary in the information with nothing new discussed.
2,Sounds good but where is the beef,"I have not been a able to find a good book on covered calls yet. I understand most of the process but too many of these authors simplify the process. There is too much ""slippage"" in the process and you have to watch your timing on using covered calls. This is not a strategy that everyone can easily use and be successful."
2,.....and this is not the one.,"The quality of the recording and the playing on this recording is excellent. However, the tempos are not only brisk, they are quite irritatingly so, without space, rushed and frenetic. The tempos constantly cross the line of creating excitement, rather creating a sense that Bach himself might step in and say ""please! stop rushing through nuance after nuance of phrasing for the sake of your pompous pace."" The Brandenburgs are so common place today that it is very easy to just accept whatever initially looks and sounds like a quality production. I myself would rather have just one copy that pleases me......and this is not the one."
4,A Great Sound Track,"Another Great Soundtrack From Dreamworks Records.Alot of The Tracks Are Great Such as Counting Crow's ''Accidentally in Love'', Lipps Inc.'s ''Funkytown'', and Others.But Some of The Tracks Are Not That Great Such as Frou Frou's ''Holding Out For A Hero'', and Nick Cave's ''Pepole Ain't No Good''.The Best Tracks on The CD Are Eddie Murphy & Antonio Bandera's ''Livin' La Vida Loca'', and Jennifer Saunder's ''Holding Out For A Hero'' (I Thought That Was Better Than Frou Frou's Version).Overall Rating-4/4"
1,ZRODN,"im going to send this cd to sasha, tiesto, and armin van buuren especially mr buuren because his so called special 80 track december 2006 import state of trance is completely off i mean this guy controls the whole ship and cant place proper sound format on a cd but the masses pay and buy it unbeilevable im gonna make a cd compilation of various toilets flushing around the world the masses will buy it. im so disapointed in the masters above because they are better than this i have heard them sound better maybe their ear drums are popped i dont know but somethings off and its probably the e and massive quantities of loot they are probably like hey there are 9 million songs 12 thousand labels nobody will know the difference"
4,"""Politically Correct""","This is one of eight books on Astrobiology which were rushed out after the publication of Joseph's revolutionary and ground breaking text, in May of 2000. Like the other seven competing volumes, this text differs from Joseph's, in that it strictly holds to the ""party"" line, as approved by the United States government, and repeats, without any critical analysis, mainstream scientific dogma. Now, don't get me wrong. Although he avoids mentioning Joseph's book--which clearly triggered the writing of his own--Darling does an otherwise good job of provding a ""politically correct"" overview of the status quo. If you are interested in the views held by mainstream, government funded scientists, this is the book for you."
2,"Hmm, not sure this sends the right message","Life is communication...to have criteria that must be met or ""kick him out"" seems to be extreme and might send people on a wild goose chase for the perfect unreal man rather than a real one. I will await her book on 100 reasons to dump HER out next. I find that ultimatums rarely solves anything in the real world. I found 100 reasons to regret buying this."
1,"Leaks like crazy, even with a new O-ring","I purchased this item after I read the previous reviews thoroughly. So, I knew it may leak, but it could be fixable with a new O-ring, and I knew it will be shorter than 25-ft. So, when I got it and it leaked (as predicted), I went to a hardware store right away to buy a O-ring. Well, it didn't fix the leak. And, the hose is about 10' at max when it is stretched. I ended up returning it. I will believe other reviewers' comments from the next time."
2,wrong kind of coils!,"I've had coiled hoses for years, but my older one got small pinholes in it and I needed a new one ASAP. Unfortunately, this was right around Christmas, when all lawn and garden depts in stores were carrying Holiday stuff, and they didn't have the coiled hose I usually get, from Target. So, i went online and found this one. The circumference of the coil is much smaller than my older one, and the coils are very tight. As a result, it doesn't pull open as easily as my older one, and you almost have to fight with it to get it to reach anywhere further than about 5 feet! I only use it on my porch, and my other one ( 25ft) works great, but this one simply would not reach. I used it, grudgingly, until I saw Target re-stocking their lawn and garden, and bought my old standby coil hose again, and will keep this one only for emergencies! I would not recommend it."
2,"I love the concept, but it's way shorter than I would have expected","Does not even reach to my car, and my car is parked not even 10 steps from the faucet. Very disappointed."
4,Get's the job done,Been using it for a couple of months and seems to do it's job (getting the plants wet). Perfect size for what I needed it for.
3,Think of it more like 12 feet.,"I suppose there's technically 25' of hose here, but only about half of that is usable.I only needed a watering hose to stretch 15' from the faucet on the front of my house to the front porch, so I could tend our flowers without needing a watering can. While this hose is adequate for the job, it's only barely adequate. I figured 25' would be more than enough, but I was wrong. I can maybe stretch it 10'-12' or so, to about the middle of my porch.On the plus side, it doesn't leak, and it does coil up nicely on its own. I wouldn't recommend this unless the stuff you're watering is almost adjacent to the faucet."
4,Good choice!,"I wanted a hose that would not take up much space, did not need a storage unit, and offered flexibility of use. It also had to be light-weight and durable. This hose fits the bill perfectly."
3,shorter than you'd think,"It is 25 feet completely uncoiled i would guess - with the coils much, much shorter. I would guess I can stretch it to 12-15 by giving it a good pull. Just barely enough that it works for my patio. But, quality seems good. Length deceptive. Over-order what you think you need."
4,it's small,It's a fine hose but I didn't pay close attention to the description when I ordered it. It's very small. I couldn't use it this year but will be able to utilize it in the green house in years to follow.
4,Get the 50ft hose if you expect to water more than one close spot,I was really surprised. I thought this hose would go much farther than it did in practice. My mistake. I returned it to Amazon (which was easy to do) and purchased the 50 footer. Great hose and perfect for my needs at 50 feet!
4,Nice for Small Areas,"I have stetched this out to 20', and it coild up nicely again, but it's hard to naigate it around plants at that distance. I'd suggest this for spaces where you only have to water 10' away, and don't have large shubs or perennials in the way. I do like it, though, because the hose vanishes by itself and I don't have to mess with making it look tidy."
4,COME WHAT MAY - DID!!!,"Very pleasant book! The premise was familiar. I like the hero and heroine very much. The banter back and forth was excellent. You knew what was going to happen, but like life, it's the journey that's the best part, not the destination.Colonial American depicted was very well written. Slavery reared it's ugly head. Claire was a very strong heroine. Nice easy read. It must have been enjoyed; the paperback was well worn. :D"
2,Noisy,Using the built in microphone picks up the noise of the motor as the tape winds. Unsatisfactory unless you use an external mic.
2,Works great for a little while.,"I used this product for about a year before it started giving me problems. To be honest I used the cassette recorder a LOT, sometimes 8-10 hours a day. So it breaking down in a year probably meant I had over 2000 hours of use on it. After that point though the cassettes stick and don't playback the recordings anymore. I think it's time for me to upgrade to a digital recorder so I can upload my recordings onto my computer."
5,RECORDER,I ABSOLUTLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT THATS WHY I AM GOING TO GET ANOTHER ONE VERY SOON AS I KEEP THE RECORDER TO USE FOR MY MESSAGES AND MUSIC THAT I PLAY
1,USELESS: DO NOT CONFUSE THIS WITH TCM500DV,"I have been happily using the more expensive SONY TCM500DV for over four years to record my lectures. I play them back them in my study preparing future lectures. And most usefully, I play back my last lecture in my car on the way back home from the lecture to catch glitches, omissions, etc. and then on the way to the next lecture to refresh my memory. I really enjoy the convenience and the sound quality.In contrast, the quality of sound produced by the cheap TCM200DV is so bad that it is difficult to tell what I said even though I just finished saying it. The motor is noisy and there is a constant scratching noise on the recording--it is very unpleasant to listen to. Besides, the controls are awkward, it has no auto-reverse, and it has a very cheap and flimsy feel to it--more like a toy than a piece of equipment. I bought one and returned it as soon as I tested it."
4,works!,It's good to have tape! I dont trust digital. This is what Sony does best! No fancy buttons or gear.
5,Sony TCM-200DV Standard Cassette Voice Recorder,"I use this device to listen to books on tape at work in a wood shop. I owned one and it was stolen and I was heartbroken. I've tried maybe 5 other kinds and nothing comes close for battery life, ease of use, and compactness. I would highly recommend this tape recorder for anyone needing one. The speed control allows you to speed up, and the 2x switch allows you to get twice as much on a tape, only you have to play it back on this player or one that also allows for 2x recording/playing.."
4,"Dandy ""Old Technology"" Gadget","It is small and lightweight, yet doesn't have a ""chintzy"" feel about it: Fit and finish is good.Purchased it for listening to audio books on cassette tapes, and works great for that. Sound quality on playback is very good, with no weird noises or hiss.Best feature is Fast Forward and Reverse buttons that do what they say. Tape Counter would have been nice. Wife says she thinks is the best portable cassette player she's ever had. Hands down MUCH nicer than any player we've bought from Walmart or Kmart to date. For about $30 is hard to beat for the purpose intended.UPDATE: It crapped out after a week. Just quit.Return thru Amazon was EXCELLENT, no cost - they emailed a pre-paid label, and credit my account promptly.Solution was to ""move it up a notch"" and buy the next expensive one, at least it does indeed have a tape counter. We will see, time will tell. They look very similar, hopefully the new more expensive one will last."
2,I Sent It Back,I didn't care for the sound quality at all of this recorder. Sounded like a kids toy. The speaker just didn't do the job. It also needs a tape counter of some kind. Very hard to find points on the tape that you might want to go back to.
4,Works well,"Product arrived in specified time, not as quick as I would have liked... brand new. I have no complaints with how it works. Sound quality is excellent, really, and its easy to use. Just a warning - I have used this model before, and after awhile, it stops working. I know, I know - its time to upgrade to the newer technology."
1,NOT for lecture halls or meetings,"As a test, to make sure of the range, for recording a meetng, I did the following. The recorder failed completely. I turned the T.V. to a normal level. At eight feet away, the only playback was static. The recorders did not pick up the sound until I was six feet away. The only way it might be used in a meeting is if you only wanted to record one person and you placed the recorder immediately next to that speaker. Also, it does not automatically stop at the end of rewind."
3,Good for voice,"I got this recorder to tape rehearsals with my band. Unfortunately, it's not well suited to that purpose--both settings on the microphone are too sensitive to record such loud sounds as drums and amplified guitar. For lecture recording and other similar purposes, though, it seems like this would work really well. It's a good recorder, just not what I was looking for."
4,Sony hand held tape recorder review,I'm very happy to get this recorder as I thought hand held tape recorders were unavailable these days. It works very well.
4,Sony TCM-200DV cassette recorder,The product arrived in a timely manner. We are completely satisfied with the quality and performance. It is as advertised.
4,Sony cassette recorder,This is a very good buy for the money. I recommend it for taping conversations. It would not be good for money.
3,Double Speed Control Broke After Few Weeks,"Everything seems to work fine except for the double speed control. It broke after few weeks of use. Luckily, it is still within 30 days of purchase. So I returned it and plan to buy another one later."
5,It is an excellent product!,"Cute, easy to operate and works seamlessly! I would recommend this product to others looking for a mini cassette player and recorder.Sony TCM-150 Cassette Recorder with Automatic Recording Level Control"
3,Be careful!,"The Sony TCM-200DV was advertised with a ""Dual Power Source"" No only did t arrive w/o a battery but the AC power source was not in the packaging. It was depicted in the manual. Though the item was listed as eligible for free shipping, I paid for shipping. This is not like the Amazon I have dealt with before."
3,"Quick service, wonderful product","I was amazed at your prompt service. The product in conjunction with the price is superb. I returned an inferior model to my University (FIU) when I saw a superior model (2 rec. speed, etc) at a cheaper price.I am grateful for your efficiencyRoberto Montoya"
2,Cassette Voice Recorder,"This is my review of the Sony Standard Cassette Voice recorder. The recorded voice/sounds are very scratchy. You cannot barely understand what is being said. Not good quality at all. I would request to return this item, but it would probably cost too much to do so."
4,"Easy to use, high quality for simple usage.",I am only listening to a tape that is half an hour and the quality is excellent. I have not used it to record so I cannot speak to that. Very handy!
1,Sony Failed to Work,"I purchased this item with hopes of replacing the same item I had used for only 2 years. The item I used stopped working after 2 years. However, when the item arrived, there was not cord. I had to purchase another cord from radio shack to so it would play without AC. Unfortunately, it failed to play at all."
2,Not great,"I bought this cassette player because I heard it was good for recording music rehearsal (I'm an opera singer) and my old cassette player (panasonic) broke after 10 years. This Sony had a constant buzzing and static sound in the background and thus it was useless for hearing anything beyond a basic sound. Might be okay for a lecture but I found the static very distracting and a hindrance to good sound quality of any kind. I sent it back immediately. Thanks for the refund. And yes, my old cassette player (now off market) was fantastic with a high grade sound quality."
4,you get what you buy,the quickest way to evaluate this TCM-200Dv is--Read the manual the recorder does everything it saysit can do with no problems
1,Totally Juvenile,As a fan of Lipinski's I was extremely let down by this book. It was Juvenile and frankly she seemed sort of gloating and egotistical. Tara no longer seems as fun to me :( .
1,Totally Trash!,The book itself is complete fluff. I couldn't even finish it and found it to be a waste of money. Worst of all was picture that showed Michelle Kwan crying next to Tara with her huge grin. I thought that in poor taste and a horride-over-the-top addition to a totally horrible book.
1,Didn't enjoy it...,"I did not buy this book but I checked it out of the public library, I am glad I did not buy it. Thought it had some wonderful photos of Miss. Lipinski I do not think it was written very well, it was mainly just pictures... I think Tara could have gotten a better author to write for her. I do not dislike Tara but I do dislike this book... and I really disapprove of the photo of Michelle Kwan at the very end! That was rude in my opinion, they could have found a much nicer picture of Miss. Kwan... or just not have put her in the book at all!"
3,Sweet Journey,"In this pictorial legacy, the reader is treated to the history and triumphant win of Gold Medal winner, Tara Lipinski, the fourteen year old who claimed the highest honor in women's figure skating in the 1998 Winter Olympics. Simon Bruty's exquisite photographs showcase the hard work, beauty, grace and poise of this young skater, who claimed the hearts of sports enthusiasts worldwide in that chilly winter in Japan. This book is a real treat to those who love the sport in all of its marvelous facets."
1,Totally Tara,I never received this book. I was charged on my credit card and have still not received the book a month later!
4,A picture book,"This book is 145 pages long, and nearly every single one of those pages is a picture. Some of the pictures have words written on them, but this is a picture book. Don't get me wrong though, these pictures do a good job of showing Tara's preparation for the 1998 games, and her experiences while she was there. You get a good look inside her training, and her mind set entering the games.So, if you want to see a LOT of pictures of tara, and get a somewhat limited idea of her life, buy this book, but if you're looking for an autobiography...this isn't one."
1,Snooze-a-thon with a hint of self-glorifying.,"How concieted can you get? This book does nothing but glorify it's subject and belittle her competitors. To add, the writing in this book is minimal. It's more of a picture book for the elementary school student as it has little literary value. If you want a book on figure skating, buy Culture on Ice instead."
4,It captures Tara's essence perfectly,"Tara Lipinski fans will be delighted with this colorful book. It includes Tara's triumphant competitions in 1997 and her outstanding Olympic success in 1998. Enjoy it, Tara fans, especially the full color photos of glowing, shining Tara"
2,More writing is needed,"This is a Tara Lipinski picture book, and that's about it. Picture books are for small children. Seems to me the writer was too lazy to actually write about her or perhaps he thought Tara's fan don't know how to read or don't care to read? Tara's fans deserve better. This book would have been excellent if there had been more written, informative details about her quest for Olympic gold along with the beautiful photos rather than the simplistic dribble that was written."
5,an enjoyable book by an inspiring young woman,"When watching Tara Lipinski skate, it's obvious that she enjoys skating. When reading this book, the same fact is evident. It focuses on her preparation for the 1998 Winter Olympic Games, where she performed the best performance of her career and took home the Olympic Gold medal.This book is well-written and well-formatted, with lots of text that sounds like Tara's own voice and wonderful pictures of her life on and off the ice. For any fan of skating, this is a fine look at the work that goes into training for a competition."
5,A Must Read,"This little book by Jens Jensen should be read as literature. I'm a language arts teacher, so I plan on using the book when I get a regular gig. Ha! Its effusive prose is a plea for humans to look to nature for more than therapy: for wisdom and guidance. Is it naive and Romantic? Maybe, but it is inspired and will at least make you want to get off your can and go for a walk in the park."
5,A very touching and moving book.....,"I read this book aloud to my husband and sons. Many times I choked my way through John's letters. I've known of John & Elaine's story for many years--you see, Elaine is my husband's aunt--yet reading the entire story, the heartwrenching struggles of each of these people, the deep love they shared, reached straight into my heart. As a wife, I ached with Elaine's story of waiting at home and cherishing every word of a loving husband's letters. At the same time, I found John's letters, letters of love and devotion and deep contemplations of war and its effects, very moving. The devotion to the Lord Jesus is evident throughout the book--both had hearts for serving Him. Also, the message of salvation is given clearly in this book--a book that can bless veterans and non-veterans alike."
2,So Far Afield that it's just plain boring.,"I loved Girl Interrupted, but Far Afield lacks the same emotional insight. I found the main character, Jonathan, to be empty, lacking in self-awareness, and just plain boring."
4,"A decent read, but not without disappointments","I liked the book very much, but I was disappointed with the way it was written. The ending was too open-ended, a complaint I have had in the past with other authors. Why work so hard on writing an exceptional novel such as Far Afield and not give it a proper ending. The relationship with the Danish woman ended poorly and Jonathan's believe that he could never return or for that matter stay in the Faroes is rediculous. To make such an asertion is to not have learned anything from the expierence of living in the Faroes to begin with"
5,Dowland Measured in Megatonnage,"For a comprehensive collection of John Dowland's music performed with exquisite perfection, there's just no comparison with this massive compilation of vintage recordings by The Consort of Musicke led by Anthony Rooley, first released in the late 1970s and the dawn of the 1980s. Songs, lute music, consort music, keyboard transcriptions -- they're all on the twelve discs that constitute this magnificent set. Highly recommended."
5,"At long last, Joe Mooney on CD.","Joe Mooney has been the singer's singer for so many years and all without any recognition. Sinatra and Tony Bennett have always raved about Joe Mooney but the public has never been exposed to this great artist. This release is full of his old Decca releases and more (a live WNEW session with Art Ford). If you are a fan of ""off beat"" but wonderful vocalists (if you like Woody Herman singing) you will love this and play it over and over."
4,Great lamp,"We got this for our 7 year old son for Christmas to use as a nightlight in his room (we turn it off after a couple hours once he falls asleep.) He just loves it. The glitter swirls better than a traditional lava lamp, and casts a very cool glow in his room. I would have given it 5 stars, but we had to replace the original lightbulb after approx. one month. The little lights are difficult to find (we had to go to a specialty lighting store to find the right size.) It may have just been a faulty bulb because once we replaced it, we haven't had any more problems with the lamp. I recommend this lamp."
5,"Fun mood lamp - better than a ""lava"" lamp","Great mood light - glitter moves in the ""jelly"". When I purchased I thought this was a lava lamp - its not, its better. I remember our first lava lamp - like 1968 - we were so cool. Problem with the lava lamps is that eventually the ""lava"" got tired and broke down into small drops. I don't think that will happen with this lamp as the glitter is suspended in a jelly like mass which moves as it heats up and rises to the top then cools and sinks to the bottom but without any breaks in the mass. Hard to describe but take it from a genuine 60's survivor - its very cool. I'm very happy with the purchase and would definitely purchase again."
3,It little and its ok,On the small side..I think my daughter turned it on two times since Christmas..I have seen others that I like much more.
5,"Lava Lite 16"" Lamp",This is a really good lamp. I would reckamrnd this lamp to anyone. I got my lamp right away from the company.
3,Started off a cool cobalt blue but...,"At first it was a pretty blue but it quickly turned aqua, then a pale blue then pale green and so on. Also, the glass gets really hot. I ended up donating it to GoodWill."
4,Great Glitter Lamp,"My daughter loves this lamp. It's worked well for the 2 months we've had it. It's too bright for a nightlight as it is, but she watches it until she falls asleep. Very soothing and lower maintenance than a fish tank!"
4,Lava Power,"I seem to like the glitter lamps more than the lava lamps. They are great for a night light or a low powered light for a bedroom. This lamp is very ""cool""."
3,Gets very hot,this plug in lava lamp glitter lamp is nice but it gets hot. Not quite appropriate for a kids room.
3,chee,Loved this lava lamp when I first got it. I kept it on almost every night for an hour or two. After about 5 months the water has turned pink and I do not like it anymore. Wish it had lasted longer
3,Cute,"This unit comes in 3 pieces, the top silver part, the glass body and the base. It'd be better if it was all one piece. It gets extremely hot once you've had it on for a while. The glitter is really pretty. I just didn't feel as though it was worth the price so I sent it back."
5,Great Value,This is a great buy but know it is small and gives off very little light - perfect for our use but perhaps not for everyone.
2,Not what I expected,"We used the sleep sack with the swaddle as a newborn thru about 3.5 months old. We sewed the arms shut, so she could not get out of the swaddle, but other than that we loved it. We then upgraded to this one as she got older. Bottom line, we don't use it. It is about a foot and a half too long! Much too much fabric. It doesn't make sense. And I'm conserned that she'll get all caught up in it at night when she turns over. It was a waste of money."
3,Does NOT come with folders!,"I needed a place to store all my documents and I think this chest does it perfectly. It fits both the Letter and Legal paper sizes, which is good. However, be advised that it does not come with folders so you will need to purchase them separately - and it can become more expensive than other similar solutions. Also, the locks seem really cheap and are actually weak, so this chest does not protect your documents from theft. Overall, this is a good product and I would give it four stars if it was a little less expensive and came with at least a few folders. I would only give it five stars if it also had stronger locks."
2,Have heard better recordings,Recording quality is poor. Erika Koeth's (Queen of the Night Solo) voice is extremely flat and sounds distorted.
3,"Ok, but not great","This book was a little bit hard to understand, especially if you are not knowledgable on the subject. I would recommend something more clear and easier to read."
2,Not too happy,Plant arrived with several of the bead strands broken off. I have moved it to about three different window locations and temperatures and it progressively does worse. No sign of any flowering likely.
5,Lovely plant,Bought it as a gift. The recipient loves this plant. Nice blossoms that do look like little goldfish. Makes a really nice gift!
2,Goldfish Plant,"Received the goldfish plant one year ago. It was packaged very well and had numerous ""goldfish"" flowers on the plant.However it has been one year later and no flowers, very disappointed. Followed all instructions regarding care ofthis plant. Reason I ordered this plant was because of review about continual flowers, but again disappointed, noflowers."
2,Not doing so well...,"When I got mine, it was very carefully packaged. It was cute! I've had it for several months and it hasn't improved. It hasn't grown, no blooms. I still think it's cute, but I'm a bit sad there aren't any 'goldfishes'."
4,Vibrant Plant,"This is a beautiful and unusual plant. It's quite striking with the contrast of the dark, waxy green leaves and the gorgeous orange blossoms...it really does resemble a goldfish! I am so impressed with the care that was taken in shipping a live, delicate plant, especially in the winter months. I would recommend this highly and would definitely buy from this seller again."
1,Not so good plant,"I had purchased from this seller before, and so I could not believe it when I received this poorly wrapped plant, in a plastic pot with holes in the bottom but with no drip-tray attached. There was a small plastic hanger to attach to the pot, so it does hang if you wouldn't mind the water falling all over the floor whenever you decide to water it. The plant looked as though someone had recently taken cuttings from it. It was not healthy looking at all. All that was left in the pot of soil was two lengths of plant and various stumps that had been cut. It was not at all full as pictured and definitely it is nowhere near flowering, since I am left nursing it to health... I think this seller has ""hit or miss"" items, because I'd received much nicer and more cared for plants in the past from them."
2,"No flowers, no attached tray - messy to water","It is growing nicely, and the leaves are pretty - though not a single flower or bud so far. (I've had it about 2 months)However - although it's a hanging plant - it is open at the bottom. There is no attached saucer.That means for an indoor plant - watering is messy. You have to figure out some way of catching the water that runs through the holes at the bottom.I phoned to complain - but got no satisfaction. It is misleading - to call this a hanging INDOOR plant.I will repot - if I ever find hanging pots of the right size (the ones at amazon are too big)"
2,Cheap price cheaply made,"I bought this toy for my 2 and 4 yr olds. It fell apart that day. NOT sturdy at all, wheels keep falling off and then the whole thing falls apart. Not a good buy."
2,"Not just inexpensive, but CHEAP","We got this for our 4 year old son for Christmas and now 4 days later, it has broken twice. I fixed it the first time, but I'm not fixing it again. My son loves playing with it. He is developmentally-delayed and in the past couple of days this toy has greatly improved his ""pretend"" play skills. So we will replace it --- with a more sturdy one!"
2,Buy a different cart!,"YIKES! This toys is a danger to the child playing with it and a pain for the parents. When we put it together our daughter took it all over the house, and, by the end of the night, we were piecing it back together. If pressure is put on the handle, the wheel piece snaps away from the base causing serious problems. Each time she plays with this cart, we have to snap the base to the sides so that she doesn't hurt herself while playing. It seemed like a good deal for the money but the potential hazard it creates and the hassle of fixing it each day makes a more expensive toy well worth it."
1,Not worth the money,This toy is of very low quality and is so flimsy I am sorry that I did not read the reviews before purchase. Toys r us should drop this one.
5,Insight Files from the Psychic World by Sylvia Browne,Very enlightening with wonderful stories and a great read!
2,"Repeat, Reapeat","I am rating this book only a two for the following reason, seems each time I pick up a Sylvia Browne book and start to read I feel like I am reading all the same information as I read in the previous books. So far the first hunk of this book is repeating information from previous books and why would I want to pay to read stuff I already read in three or four of her other books? I quickly learned only pick up her books from our library so I won't be paying for something I will only be disappointed in later. I hope this book get's better towards the end."
3,Interesting but...,"I tend to like her audioseminars better than her audiobooks read by someone other than Sylvia. It was hard to sit through this one. If you listen to anything by Sylvia, I'd recommend ""Angels and Spirit Guides"". It contains her best messages and her best sense of humor."
1,Poor quality,"I bought this toy for my neice for Christmas, it arrived on time but when I opened the box to wrap it, the beads were all falling out. The stitching was loose or missing in several areas. It was awful. I immediately returned it and of course Amazon gave me a full refund but I wouldnt recommend this product."
5,The ultimate recording!,"When I heard this recording the first time it didn't take long until I realized how good it was. From the beginning to the end it is a masterwork! It is dramatic and lyrical, exciting and touching. Sumi Jo and Barbara Bonney are absolutely brilliant in their roles! Arnold Östman is a superb Mozart interpreter and with this recording he puts himself among the greatest opera conductors. Just go and listen for yourself, you won't regret it!"
2,My product was somewhat damaged.,"This was supposed to be brand new, however it was not sufficiently packed and the box was damaged. I did check all the discs after reading other peoples reviews to make sure there were no scratches because unless Amazon has a 6 month return policy to realistically watch this entire series it would take 1/2 a year and that is watching it deligently. So if you purchase this make sure that you check it out right away otherwise you will probably regret it. Regarding the show I've gotten through the first 5 seasons and they are the complete episodes without the cutting of the reruns."
2,I am still trying to figure something out ...,"Why is it that the networks and studios who produce, and distribute these television series have no concern for the people who buy them ?Allow me to explain, they lure you in with individual season releases, and then after about half the seasons are already out on DVD, they slam you with the ""full series"" boxed sets, thus making you spend even more money on episodes you most likely already have.I love Law & Order, but I already own several seasons, and I can't see spending this much money re-buying seasons I already own.Why do these production companys' and studios care so little for their customers ?"
3,20 Years of Law and Order,"I was very happy when I came upon the complete series of Law and Order while surfing the Internet. The order came very quickly however the ""collectors box"" which holds the 20 seasons of DVDs was damaged when I took it out the mailing box (could have been packed much better). I have not watched the entire series yet however the ones I have seem to be of good quality."
1,The price just went up by $400. Save your money til it goes back down.,"I can think of no reason why anyone should pay over $600 for something that was just $200 something a few days ago. Yes, I know prices fluctuate, but I would hate to be the person who paid this outrageous amount and then found out that $400 of it was unnecessary."
1,Hmm,One star due to quality of product not the quality of show material Hoping amazon makes it right..bought at the lower price...should have known better...several defective disks and cases were not pristine....
3,Great deal as a whole but...,"Well as it stands right now in late September 2011 the price is $490. Now that works out to $24.5 a season. Not bad but a lot of the ones that are already out go on sale at Best Buy and Barnes & Noble for around $10. Not to mention they are ALWAYS on cable. It's a lot of money in this economy to spend at once.Secondly, all seasons from 5 onward were filmed in widescreen for HDTVs. Season 14 will NOT be the HDTV airings, but the DVDs that came out at the time, cropped to a 'full screen' ratio, which won't even look right since most people have widescreen TVs now."
1,Great show but what's with the shakedown NBC $$$?,"A pleasant surprise. I can't be the only person who thought at the rate NBC was going, the box set would have been released by 2066. Wonderful show, actors, writing all of it! Worth owning. Very easy to watch episodes again as the details and endings are sometimes impossible to remember.However, like most fans I spent a small fortune collecting the first 8 Seasons (along with Season 14) that have been released. Now these hotdogs want $489.99? Amazon can you hear this: Law and Order = Gold Box. $189.99 ... let's move some merchandise!At this price, it feels like we are paying a licensing fee. Which sounds like something NBC would do. *N*ever *B*rowbeat *C*onsumers."
2,Malibu Barbie Hooker,"This is sort of the Danielle Steele romance novel version of a prostitute's life. I guess I expected more since this writer came from a column at Salon, but this reads like a fantasy life in which Nancy Chan mostly buys designer clothes and gets beauty spa treatments and visits her therapist and oh, just ever so incidently finances it with occasional services to high-paying, gentlemanly customers whose body fluids she never ever ever comes in contact with. You can figure out just how great this lifestyle is by the fact that the crux of the slender plot is how nancy has to keep her career from her fiance. Anything so essential part of one's life that one must obfuscate from one's inteneded life partner can't be all that innocuous."
3,Saucy; light read..,This call girl likes what she does. Definitely an interesting read ala The Happy Hooker....
1,AWFUL BOOK,"I'm so glad I bought it used for one cent, it was still overpriced. I bought it to occupy myself on my treadmill, but it bored me to death. Simply put,there is no plot. The characters seemed fake to me. In good books, characters seem like real people. She just describes one sex act after another, talks too much about jasmine(who seemed like the main character)and a hookers union. There is no story. The most ridiculous thing in the book is when the main hooker character goes to see her attorney and the attorney spills the beans on her future sister in law, saying ""oh, she's doing undercover work now on....."". Right. An attorney is going to tell secrets to his hooker client. I'm an attorney, and I can assure the author that such an attorney would be disbarred. Stay away from this horrible book!!!!!!!!"
2,Not very realistic,"Although this book is a good ""beach book"", it's not very realistic. Her average client pays $300 ( not top level in New York, especially in the 90s and 2000) and she seems to have about 4 clients including the clients from her Network. There is no way you could survive in New York City on 4 clients unless they were paying very high rates on a very regular basis ( more than every 6 months like one of her clients). And still be able to buy expensive bags, shoes and clothes? This book was more like a Sex in The City type story then a true account of what it's like to be a highly paid call girl. The only character that seemed realistic was Jasmine. She is a go getter, cut throat and very pessimistic. She is always trying to ""build up her book"" at whatever the cost. That seems to be more of what a successful and independent call girl would be like."
3,"Fun, but fluffy.","Amusing.. I read it from cover to cover in an afternoon. A clear sign that it was amusing, but not deep enough to require any thought. Take it if you plan on sitting at the airport for a few hours... but I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a satisfying read that makes you think."
1,I wouldn't even give this book 1 star,"Ok I started reading this book because I was really interested in what a life of a Call Girl could be. On this point, it was really interesting NOW about the other context, about the character's private life with her fiancee, it simply grossed me out. What kind of image of a working girl and women in general, is Miss Quan trying to portray ?? The character obviously has no real feelings for her fiancee, never once does she wonder about quitting her profession for her marriage to be, never once she poses herself any moral issues about lying to her partner in life and she actually cites many times that she does not wish to marry, actually doesn't really love that guy more than any others but at the end still gets married (to escape any legal issues)and we learn this while she's getting undressed for her John.This simply isn't real life."
3,guh,this book was okay....no plot really just vivid sex dreams i at least thought there would be a problem that needed solving.... some of the characters are just plain annoying.....
1,not worth a call out,"I found this book quite frustrating and more like a mills and boons - it simply didnt cut it and the characters were frustrating and repitive ,in fact it was all about the relationships, with no real depth. very annoying indeed."
5,"A fast moving, very funny, very spicy novel.","""Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl"" is a fast moving, very funny, very spicy novel that has unexpected subtlety and depth. It does what Henry James claimed for his ""Turn of the Screw."" It ""sets traps for both the wary and the unwary reader."" Diary is replete with very subtle literary allusions, particularly to the earlier literature of prostitution. For example, Nancy's therapist is Wendy Kessel. Joseph Kessel is the author of ""Belle de Jour,"" the story of a Parisian housewife who moonlighted as a prostitute. Taken as a whole, the world and work of Nancy Chan is a metaphor for the contemporary world at large, intertwining sexual, romantic and economic relations. In this regard, the novel is not unlike Jean Genet's play, ""The Balcony,"" which used the brothel to represent the human world. ""Diary"" can be read purely for entertainment, which is perhaps unfortunate, since a more careful reading yields unexpected rewards."
2,disappointed ...,The book started off good but I was disappointed at the abrupt ending. I'm sure being a call girl is not all fun. I was expecting to read about the good AND bad experiences with johns. The book was also fairy-talish to me.
3,It was okay...,"Interesting enough that I could continue to read if I had time but easily able to put it down. Fun little insights into the industry and definitely more chicklit than erotic. If you miss this one, you're not missing much. I probably won't read Diary of a Married Call Girl."
2,Not Very Compelling,"I wanted so much for this book to work. The sex element carries it, not the plot, not the characters. And like so many C- books in the publishing business, writers who cannot seamlessly shift back and forth from the human condition in the modern world to the most trivial aspects of American culture have to rely on lasciviousness to entice readers. Too bad. Too bad. Maybe next time Quan will have developed more appreciation for the subtleties of humans interaction, rather than relying on blatant lewdness."
5,"A witty, observant picture of elite ""sex workers"" in NYC","How refreshing it is, after a season of terrorist-caused tragedy, to be reminded of what a frothy, fun, self-absorbed little culture Manhattan can be.It may be frivolous, but that too is part of the New York City we love!"
2,NO CLIMAX!!!,"At the finish of this book, the reader is left hanging to wonder in anti-climactic annoyance about too many things. Among the many unanswered questions in this book is one particularly annoying question because it is so steadily built up, then left frustratingly unanswered: why is Nancy's district attorney sister-in-law constantly plying her with double-entendre questions & suspicious comments about Nancy's career? Does the D.A. sis-in-law know something? Too, the last chapter jumps 8 mos. leaving a multitude of unanswered questions! Ridiculous!!"
2,"Trite, Dissapointing",Quan is vapid. She advocates a world-view that is disturbingly divorced from reality given her very real-life profession.You've got to pity the man who actually married this piece of work.
3,OK,"It was well done, not my usual read but went along quite well. I enjoyed it.. Would recommend it to anyone who likes a good cops and robbers type read... Not that this is, but still the same area of interest"
4,"Silly, fun read.","I enjoyed the sarcastic, light mood of the writer. The book goes from sexy to hilarious from one page to another, and it was enjoyable to read before bed."
2,"Don't believe the hype, this book isn't that good","This book is as brainless as ""Sex and the City."" I certainly wish that I didn't get the book from [...], I could have checked it out from the library. The novel is written by a former call girl. The main character, Nancy, has a finace that knows nothing of her being a call girl. I find that repulsive. She sleeps with loads of men for money while at the same time pretends to be true to her fiance. I am not speaking against the occupation of a call girl so much as to her keeping it a secret from her fiance."
1,Terrible!!,"This book is terrible. It's trying very hard to be funny when it really is NOT. Its about as sexy as a 6th grade sexual education handbook and the characters are impossible to identify with. This is no ""Sex in the City"" or even ""Bridget Jones Diary"" for that matter. And don't get me started on the ridiculous ending...ugh! Only worth $0.50 at a swap meet."
2,not for me,"This item did not work for me, it seems like it would, it's big, but I couldn't get my windows open (used from the inside)."
1,This software is extinct,"I bought this from a discount site, and boy was it a mistake. I was thinking it might be fun for my toddler to use since he likes to bang on the keys of my laptop so much. However, this is so dated, basically a bunch of cheap dancing clip art. If you have a smart phone, there is much better toddler-friendly software to be had for free. That they are charging $29+ dollars for this here is wishful thinking."
1,Victims due to this product,"Go to Hartzvictims.OrgI am not a crusading nut, my cat got poisoned by this stuff. I applied it correctly. Within an hour she had seizures and tremors. 4 days of an uphill battle for her. She is now fine, but please don't harm your animals using this stuff. Same with BIOSPOT or Sargents."
2,Doesn't Work as Advertised,"Our little rat terrier attracts fleas like a comic book convention attracts costumed attendees. We've tried several different flea collars, including the HARTZ ULTRA GUARD FLEA AND TICK COLLAR. The box says that this collar is supposed to offer 7-months of protection. It's supposed to kill fleas and ticks and prevent the hatching of flea eggs. The collar does seem to work, but it only lasts for about 2-3 months. After that time, our little dog is once again scratching and biting. Until recently, I was unaware of the multiple lawsuits against the Hartz company. Personally, we've never had an issue with Hartz products, but after reading about the lawsuits, it is something one should be aware. Overall, though the HARTZ ULTRA GUARD FLEA AND TICK COLLAR works, it doesn't work for as long as it says it does. I recommend using a flea and tick collar from a different company."
2,"Works, but.....","I used Hartz UltraGuard OneSpot on my cat, and it did get rid of the fleas, but it left his hair a matted greasy mess. Three weeks later, it's still that way. I've even washed the hair on his neck, but it's impossible to remove the grime. Unfortunately, he's a long-haired white cat and it looks terrible. I'm going back to alternating Frontline and Advantage."
1,HARTZ WILL KILL YOUR PET,This company's products has been know to hurt your pets. This particular collar basically BURNED my dog. If you love your pets never buy Hartz again. check out hartzvictims .org
1,Does not work!,I owned a Kennel which also housed a Vetrinary Clinic and Hospital...as well as bred dogs and Horses...I have found Zodiac to be far better than any other flea collar.Hartz just does not work.
2,Don't Judge a Book by It's Cover,"Illustration-wise, this is a beautiful book. Too bad a similar compliment cannot be paid to its puzzles. Some thought went into making the puzzles varied and unusual, but their quality is rather poor. Very few of them actually made me want to sit down to solve them."
5,It's my ONE weakness!,"I am a 45 year old man and this show makes me cry almost every episode. Not a sad cry... a satisfied cry. I first heard about it while watching Gavin and Stacey (another great British tv show) and rented the first disc. I have been in love ever since. When it was all over, I rented it and watched through it all again and found myself wanting more, so I bought it. It is more like The Waltons than Little House (to me anyway) and has a great honest feel to it. It is nice to not have to hear cussing, see boobies or have violence all over the screen. Some shows have tried this and have become boring, but this show is fresh and relevant even if it is set more than a hundred years ago."
5,What a great series! Totally enjoyable!,"If you like Anne of Green Gables, the Cranford Series, and the many Jane Austen movies, you will most likely enjoy Lark Rise to Candleford. Filmed in the gorgeous English countryside (which makes everything better), the characters are strong and set in their ways and yet, they are also growing and encountering the trials of life that make them change as the series procedes. Pop the popcorn and enjoy a little get-a-way to another time!"
4,Lark Rise to Candleford,"I hadn't seen Lark Rise on TV, and it is different from what I expected, but I love the way all the characters get emphasized in the various episodes, and all become interesting people. I'm sorry the last year was cut short, for even after viewing all four seasons, I still want to learn more about them all.Two of the disks in my set had minor damage, which was upsetting but not vital. They would stall for a few seconds, and then play on, so I didn't miss any of the story. This set was marked as 'used.'"
5,LARK RISE TO CANDLEFORD,Love this series; miss seeing it on TV. I've loaned the DVDs to friends so will have to wait until they are returned to watch again.Wish they had not cancelled this. Definitely one of my favorites. Want more!!Pat Crouse
5,Can't wait to see what happens next in this small town!,Fabulous series. Received Season 1 as a gift. Had to buy the rest. Its that good. Couldn't wait to see what happens next.
3,4 star,"This was a little boring for me.It's watchable, But dosn't come close to Downton Abby. I would say they need to add more kick to this one."
5,"Best series hands down! Love, Love, Love, it!",Larkrise to Candleford is not only balm to your heart and soul but also serious eye candy.Beautifully done in all aspects. I cannot recommend this series enough. Watching it is like coming home.
5,Excellent!,"Hard to believe this was a weekly TV series - it's as good (or better) than most Masterpiece Theater presentations. Almost totally character-driven, it's a thrill to watch and keeps you deeply engrossed in the characters. Julia Sawalha is magnificent as Dorcas Lane, a character so opposite of the hideous Lydia she played in ""Pride and Prejudice"" that you can hardly believe it's her. Brendan Coyle (Downton Abbey) is excellent as Robert Timmins, along with other standouts Linda Bassett(Queenie), Karl Johnson(Twister), Sandy McDade(Margaret), Ruby Bentall(Minnie), and Victoria Hamilton & Matilda Ziegler as the Pratt sisters. This is a series that bears rewatching numerous times!"
5,Fabulous Series,My husband and I just finished watching the entire series. It was beautifully written and shot in the English countryside and on set. The stories are delighful and the viewer really feels part of the families of Lark Rise AND Candleford. We will definitely watch it again.
5,One of my favorites,"This is a 'feel good' series, but not in a sicky sweet way. It's not without it's darker places, but for the most part, it's enjoyable to watch - more than once. Although set in rural England, it could just as well be set in rural America during the same time period.An excellent cast."
5,Totally addicting,"Bet you can't watch just one episode at a time! I love this series and everyone I've shared this with has been a big fan too. Wholesome fun, even though I call it ""my own little soap opera."""
4,"Hearing My Anglophone Son Say ""Café Au Lait"" Is Hilarious","I love the way my son is pronouncing the names of these colors.The cards are very durable - and the box appears to be as well. I'm not holding my breath on the box though, ha. I'm sure someone will eventually step on it.Two negative comments, and these are hardly deal breakers for me, but buyer beware:1. The cards are freaking impossible to shuffle the way you'd shuffle a ""normal"" deck of cards.2. There aren't many cards. I guess this might not be a negative if you don't want to play very long or there are always just the two of you.Having so few cards overall I was surprised that there are multiple pairs of the same color.But my son loves it, and that's why I bought it so this is a positive review! :)"
4,good colour game,This is a lovely go fish game with loads of unusual colours for children to learn. My daughter is almost three and enjoys it although some of the colours really are a bit advanced for her but I think it's definitely something she'll grow into.
3,"Cute, but color names rather ridiculous and hard to use","The cards are cute and seem durable, but the color names are ridiculous for toddlers. Instead of cafe au lait and apricot we have to show the cards to each other and say things like ""light brown"" and ""light orange""."
4,Great beginner game!,"The cards are sturdy, and there are several colors to teach beginners. My 3 yr old and 6 yr old can both play since it's based on color, not numbers or letters!"
3,"Cute Cards, but color names a distraction","These cards are cute and will probably be fun to play with. However, it would have been better for the manufacturer to either eliminate the color names on each card, or at least use color names that a pre-schooler will recognize. (After all, pre-schoolers are learning to read.) For example, the orange card is named ""Apricot."" The yellow card is named ""Buttercup,"" Brown is ""Cafe au lait"", Light green is ""Chartreuse"" while dark green is ""Jade."" The most absurd name of all is purple which is named ""Eggplant."" Etc., etc. The creator of these cards seems to have been targeting an adult audience rather than young children."
3,Cafe au lait for 3-year-olds,"The fish shape is fun. The cards are tough. The colors pretty - the color names absurd - cafe au lait, buttercup, jade, turquoise, warm red!!!"
3,Go Fish playing cards- just ok,This Go Fish card game is cute but note what I was looking for. The cards are in great new colors but other than a simple colored fish there is nothing exciting about the cards. I bought it for my 3 year old granddaughter and she will select Madeline card game over Go Fish. Cute pictures plus color
2,Could have been better art.,"I always remember playing the fish game at all ages. This wasn't what I thought it would be. I was expecting larger, a heavier card stock and better art images for the fish."
4,"Fun game, wish it was basic colors.","The cards are high quality and very nice to play with. I wish this game or this company made one with more primary colors so I can teach my 2 yr old his colors. Great game for an older child wanting to learn Cafe Au Lait, Chartreuse, Turquoise, Apricot, Indigo, Buttercup, Eggplant, Jade, Lavender, Hot Pink and Warm Red. My 4 yr old has fun and understands the colors and maybe, just maybe, my 2 yr old will learn his fancy colors too!"
3,weird color names,"The cards are a good size and weight. Nice little storage box. The color names are the problem with this set...when kids are learning their colors it is helpful to have short accurate names so they can learn to identify the word to match the color. The color names ""chartreuse"", ""cafe au lait"", ""jade"", ""buttercup"" and ""eggplant"" are fanciful more than clarifying and belong in an adult style magazine, not on kids playing cards!"
1,Disappointed,"Very basic, nothing much more than the users manual with a few tips thrown in. Instructions tell you how to do things, but not why. Settings are not explained. Some sections are repeated twice (how to create a new track for example) Well organized, but not helpful at all. No hookup diagrams for TDM systems. I returned it for a refund."
5,Great Bike!,I use my bike everyday to get to work (and sometimes for fun). It's great quality and smoothly gets me where I need to be. A terrific purchase!
4,Comfortable bike,For $170 this is a great bike. It requires specific tools to assemble and I found the directions confusing. I took it to my local bike shop and they charged $40 which I felt was worth it to make sure it was put together correctly. There was some minor paint damage but is too much trouble to send back. It is very pretty blue color and allows me to sit upright which is easy on the back and the seat is comfortable.
5,Thumbs up for this comfortable bike!,I love my Schwinn Tornado! This bike is very comfortable to ride and was easy to assemble. I'm having so much fun and getting lots of exercise this summer thanks to this great bike.
4,Wonderfully comfortable!,"I based my purchase on previous reviews and would tell others of interest that this certainly was worth the buy! I haven't been able to find an affordable, comfortable bike in years. The mountain bikes just didn't feel right for me. This bike, although somewhat difficult for me to put together by myself, is everything I need it to be and more! Fortunately my husband knew how to adjust the brakes because they were very loose and didn't make contact. The chain was also off the main thingy and I do have to have that (the gears don't work quite right) to the bike shop for adjustment/tightening, but I can still use it as is for now and it's so comfortable!! This bike was exactly what I was looking for. BTW: I'm 36 and overweight, so needed something to help me with aerobic activity to LOSE weight....this bike is it! I love it! Do not hesitate to buy!"
4,good deal,"i purchased this bike in hopes of a an easy ride. the bike arrived quickly. the basics were already put together for you. all you have to attach is the front wheel, handle bars, 2 pedals and the seat. the instructions are a bit confusing, but only common knowledge is needed. the frame is sturdy and well made, anything bigger would be too heavy to handle.i also purchased a u-lock and will purchase a chain to lock both wheels to prevent theft."
2,Schwinn... Not what they used to be,"The Schwinn name used to mean quality bikes, not any more. This bike is a disapointment. The seat, the pedals, the cranks, the rims, even the name plate on the front, everything is of poor quality. Save your money for something else."
1,Great Idea; poor execution; do not waste your money,"The idea of having simple coiled hose that avoids the hassel of storage is very attractive. That is why I bought two of them.The reality is that the plastic is so soft and so subject to abrasion that even a slight bruising opens it to complete failure, especially in warm climates.I used my two Plastair Coiled Springhoses once and they have multiple leaks - they are a complete failure.If all you'll do is water flowers and the hoses never touch the ground or anything else except grass, perhaps they will be acceptable. However the slightest touching on the ground seems to be enough to cause catastrophic failure and a complete loss of value.What a waste of money!"
4,What a deal!,What a space saver and I can get all the way around the house with three of them connected together. Great invention and fun to use. The plants like 'em too because they get watered more often. What a deal!
1,Absolute Junk!,"All the bad reviews are correct. The hose is too light and too springy. It kinks very easily, and requires a lot of work to keep it from getting hung up on it's own coils. I bought this hose less than 2 years ago. It's gotten only very light use, and only in the summer. However, it's sprung a major leak in the middle of it's length, and is now entirely unusable.I would only consider this hose if one needed something disposable, for very light duty, and probably only in a 25' or shorter length, so that there's less hassle with kinking."
3,connectors leaking,products arrived quickly but when I use them both hoses leak from the connections to faucet.
3,Short-lived Spring,"It's a nice idea, and well priced, and doesn't leak, BUT after a few weeks of use it is already losing its ""coil"" (i.e., spring-back ability). It's just an OK product."
1,Bad customer support,"I bought this hose to water plants on my balcony. It's too narrow and flimsy to be suitable for any heavier task.The 4th time I watered, the fitting that screws to the hose bib slipped out of the hose. Amazon would not send a replacement as I'd bought it more than 30 days prior. Plastair offered to repair it, if I paid shipping to Quebec.I have learned a lesson: Low ticket items bought from Amazon effectively have a 30 day warranty. If it breaks after that, shipping charges dominate the purchase price.Postscript a week later: Amazon granted a one time exception and swapped out the hose. Good marks for Amazon. The replacement hasn't broken yet."
1,kinks!,"The hose is too small in diameter, and the water flow is not the best. The hose kinks bad! I bought 4 so I could reach the kids play area to cool down the slide and sand. The hoses knots up around each other and I have to back tract to find where the kink is."
4,Curly Hose,"Work great as a space saver and much easier to carry around than the heavier hoses.In the heat, water left in the hose will expand and split it, so be sure to turn off the spigot and open the nozzle to take the pressure off the hose. We learned the hard way, but have not had a problem since."
5,Beautiful but didn't work for my ring,"When I received the ring guard, I found that it was not suitable for my engagement ring (my ring overpowered the guard which is very dainty). Sadly, I had to return it and request a refund (JewelryDays via Amazon.com). I am waiting to receive credit back to my debit card which they say will be 10 to 14 business days.In the meantime, I found another guard thru Pompeii3 which is also an affiliate of Amazon.com, I believe. I received that purchase in good order Friday. It does not fit my ring exactly but am taking it to a jeweler after the holiday and make sure it can be adjusted properly to enhance my ring (and act as a wedding ring).I paid separately for the replacement guard so am waiting for refund on the first purchase which I am confident will be done in the time frame promised."
2,Un-substantiated Claims,"The book makes a claim on the cover that it provides a break through method for self-hypnosis. As I read multiple books on the subject, I really found nothing new just like all the other books on the topic. A chapter about history and the mind, then trying to explain why it happens then a compilation of the scripts that he uses at his office.If you read other books about the subject in the past, you will gain nothing new. If this is your first book on the topic then buy it"
1,Oh well,"I wonder who actually write the reviews of how good the book is. In reality, it is junk. Save your money."
1,"Totally useless, it teaches nothing.","I'm keen on self-hypnosis, autogenic training and other techniques, and found this book totally useless.It teaches nothing, it's just a bunch of phrases of no effect, that according to the authorshould hypnotize yourself 'with eyes open' simply repeating them over and over again!I tried to sell this book at a second hand book shop, and even there they refused it.In the end I was so annoyed that I got rid of it, yes, directly to the trash can.Save your money, buy some other book."
4,interesante,"bueno no lo eh puesto en practica, pero es bastante bueno, me quito muchas ieas falsas de lo que era el verdadero hipnotismo y bueno ya hice la primera parte yme gusto, hay que abrir un poco la mente para nosotros al hacer los ejercicios pongamos nuestro cerebro con mas voluntad de abrirse, ya lo lei todo, y ya voy a empezar los ejercicios,pero queria opinar porque hasta ahora excelente, y asi no resulten los ejercicios aprendi una realidad del hipnotismo que no sabia."
3,Brain surgery... oops Hypnosis self taught,"Interesting book. The font cover says, ""Hypnotize yourself as you read."" I can do that reading Mary Shelley. The technique works but this book claims you can clear everything up but warts on your own. On the surface, this works well for some folk. The problem is that many of the bad habits are just symptoms of the underlying problem and if you stifle the problem one-way it may pop-up unexpectedly in another way. I am far from an authority on hypnosis or habit causes. However, if it were I, I would look twice at this miracle cure.Yet I bought the book any way and am going through it. In the back of the book are customized suggestion templates. However, I cannot stand to write in books so I made my own copy.The Waking Sleep by Frank Monaghan"
5,First book on hypnosis I bought... I'm glad!,"This book truly catches the eye first off all. The cover explains it all. The idea of hynotizing yourself, by yourself, is mentioned in the title and information on what common problems people may have are mentioned in which hypnotism can help solve. Of course it is best if you are new to hypnotism, as I was, to read the first 40 pages or so before you jump right into the act of hypnotizing yourself. Though what you read is fasinating. Explaining the power of the mind and what a few discoveries the author made before writing this book. And the best part, obviously, is actually hypnotizing yourself. I only tried it once and already have it working for me. I recommend this book highly to anyone new who wants to hynoptize themselves, are interested in the subject, or just want to help solve their problems or reach a type of goal."
3,There are other ways,I found The Secret Language of Hypnotherapy by John Smale gives clear instructions for self hypnosis and how to create affirmations and visualizations easily. It is worth a try if you want to get to grips with self-hypnosis.
1,what a joke,"this book's a joke. what a shallow, meaningless production. it offers nothing new on self-hypnosis, yet preposterously sells itself as revolutionary. It's beyond superficial and unoriginal; i can't possibly find worse things to say about it. if you're interested to learn about self-hypnosis, go get Brian Alman's Self-Hypnosis: The Complete Manual for Health and Self-Change. That is a book that will teach you some real self-hypnosis skills. I'm not sure what's more pathetic--the possibility that Forbes Robbins Blair actually believes he's an innovator, or the more probable scenario that he just wants you to think he is."
3,Hmmm!,"I don't have this book but these reviews seem too good to be true. Considering how easy it is to write a review, did the publisher insert these reviews with fake amazon accounts? I hope not cos I want to buy this book but I don't want to waste my time reading something that has fake reviews. What do you think?"
3,Self-Hypnosis not for everone!,"I know a lot of people have written glorious reviews on this book. I however, remain unconvinced. I have tried the self-hypnosis ""talk to yourself"" script and must admit I felt not the least bit hypnotised. Well, having said that, I like the scripts more as affirmations than hypnosis and maybe therein lay the strenght of this book. If you don't know anything about hypnosis or affirmations then I believe this book would be of value to you if nothing else than to point you toward further studies. If however, you are looking for a method with more authentic hypnotic induction I would suggest ""The Self-Hypnosis Kit"". The kit comes with a tape which I have used several times with success. Maybe I just don't like the sound of my own voice!"
3,This is a great start...,"This book was a very interesting, although not overly insightful book. The writer does know how hypnosis works as a technique and the book as a set of applications is very useful. The only real problem is that it is a little ego driven in the parts that aren't scripts.What he talks about in the book is very true but may not work for the surface reader. If on the other hand the reader is a very vivid reader that can get lost easily in a book then this technique is definitely for them. If one were looking for a book that is less of a cook book this isn't what you are looking for.If one were just getting started and wanted to learn more about the applications and what scripts are like this is one of many one should look at to advance their interest. It is definitely worth the price one pays."
3,An interesting take on hypnosis,"A very interesting book. I can't say that it worked particularly well for me, but when doing the first part you do fall into a bit of a trance, which is pretty neat. Some of the claims of the book seem far-fetched, but I was convinced that hypnosis was real after reading the first part of the book. It's true...you do fall into a trance when reading a book, watching a film, or even listening to music. Interesting ideas, and it may work for you if you do in frequently enough. If you like messing around with your mind, by all means pick it up."
4,Instant Self-Hypnosis,The information in the book is clear and easy to follow. My problem with it is that it hasn't worked for me. At least not yet. It's been two months or so and I would have expected some results by now.
5,"Skeptic at first, but this really works!","I saw this in the book store and I simply thought I would make people do funny things, but the quality of life improvement is huge. From the very first session, I focused on stop stressing out and felt so good after I hypnotized my wife with it.I am glad to share with you I have 99% effectively conquered several ""sin""'s in my life that I have been struggling with for years. Everything from swearing to over eating and anything beyond. I am tempted to have myself get sick after eating chocolate, but I am too convinced that it would stop me from eating it!This is more than worth the money."
3,"Not durable, but nice while it works","I bought several of these units to use in my laboratory for recording sound data for later transfer to computers. They worked great for that but they are notoriously easy to break. Most of the recorders were damaged in some way within a year. Perhaps this is just the result of hard use by undergraduate students but nonetheless I was hoping they would last a little longer. My suggestion is to go for higher quality and longer lasting units instead of these unless you want something to play with and break. For the price I think they could have done a better job of making the product survive daily use, given that it is meant to be carried around and used on the street."
1,piece of junk,"My family bought this for me for Fathers Day. Worked fine for one week, but when I decided to erase and re-record new songs one week later, it wouldn't work. I went thru all the steps...downloaded upgraded software from Sony's site, used different discs, and even redid the whole thing on a different computer...nothing worked. So, on top of the $120+ my family spent on the unit, now Sony says I have to spend more money to send it from WI to Texas to get it fixed...AFTER ONE WEEK OF USE! Don't bother with this piece of junk or you might have to deal with Sony's customer service."
3,not all it's cracked up to be,"The unit itself is good, but the software that supposedly downloads music from your computer to the minidisc is lousy. The result skips and inserts large blank sections throughout all the songs. Not a very good result for the price Sony asks for this minidisc."
1,don't get stung!,"This is one of my worst purchases. Having taken some time to research MP3 players and owning a RIO, I wanted to buy something at the top end. The Sony MZ-N10 seemed to be just right. As far as the hardware goes it's great but the software is very poor and irritating. Specifically, Sony have created a process of checking in and out the MP3 files, this works only some of the time, is non intuitive, very slow and also restricts the number of times the file can be transferred (3 times). Compared to my RIO this device is a serious pain. It's a shame as it's just the software, come on Sony provide an update which is non restrictive and fix the bugs!!!!"
5,Wouldn't mind one for myself!,"Garrity 20-mode LED HeadlampWe purchased this as a gift for our son for Christmas. He loved it and tested it for us. I was impressed by its brightness and I liked the red light feature. It was much more powerful than the Black Diamond LED headlamp we have been using and the battery life is far greater. We did elect to get a battery re-charger for it, however ( purchased locally)."
4,Good light.,"Two issues with this headlamp:1. the buttons are small and have virtually no feel. they're rubber against a rubberized surface. I'll probably put a dot of tape or epoxy on them to give them some contrast.2. the bottom white leds shine through the back translucent housing causing an annoying and distracting blueish glow in your peripheral vision. I put a line of black electrical tape over it and that does perfectly.that aside, the fit is good, the weight is fine, AA last longer than AAA and swap into more devices (gps, etc), and the main beam is pleasingly bright."
4,Capable and Competent Light,"This is a good light, and I got it for a great price. My boyfriend uses this when he's working on a car at night, and he's happy with it. He's not super excited about the red lights, but the 1 watt center light seems to be just about right. The only real complaint I've heard is the pivot is not as strong (meaning it doesn't lock in place as well) as some of his other lights"
2,Dont buy Garrity headlamp KHO21G,This is barely an average headlamp. I have a few that sold for about the same price. This head lamp is highly over rated and you can find a better one at any Wal Mart or Target. I wish I had my money back.
1,"Low Quality, Heavy, and Not working properly","I just received this item from Amazon, and it didn't work. I thought that it was the problem of the batteries that were included. So, I replaced them with the new batteries, and it still won't work. It uses 3 AA batteries, and when I wore it, it felt heavy. The product looks very low-quality. I don't think that you should rely on it when it is really needed. I don't think that it will stand in rainy weather. Not recommended at all. When you REALLY need it, for example, when you come down at dusk during the rainy day in hiking, this kind of equipment should absolutely work. I doubt this product will. Shop around the better quality headlamps that use AAA batteries"
5,WOW!! Great product!,"Before I purchase this ""head-light"" I read a great review of it. When I got it I tried it out and it's every bit as good as that great review said. It's made extremely well, and the features were well thought out. You don't really need the brightest setting around the house, but it will light up the house across the street unbelievably well! It's very comfortable to wear, and has all the features you could possibly need. The ability to adjust the light to tip down at several angles has been very useful. I usually use the medium light setting on the main beam, but the dim setting is still enough light for most applications. Anytime you need light and your hands free there's a perfect light setting. The red LED's don't take away from your night vision and have come in handy severl times already in the two months I've had it. I use it more than I ever thought I would."
4,Great TV great price,This a great TV. 720P resolution makes this high def ready. Picture and sound are excellent.
3,"Decent 20"" LCD HDTV",This LCD HDTV was purchased as a 2nd TV to watch while eating dinner. The picture is great and the sound is adequate for its size. We do wish that the TV had come with an HD tuner built in as we had to purchase a separate tuner. Later models have the HD tuner built in.
2,Waste of money,"Tharoor has taken a turn for the worst in this book. He ought best stay with fiction where he can continue to live in his own fantasy world. His inability to see the war that is being waged against Hinduism gives readers the perception that he is a ""sell-out"" or a ""pseudo-secularist"". It is one thing to want social harmony but another to sell out ones culture as consideration. He remains the typical ""secular"" Hindu response to the sell out of India's soul. One ought to be proud of Hinduism and its history, not ashamed of it."
3,Exciting in pieces ...,The book tackles different areas about India from the author's viewpoint. It is based more on his experiences and analysis. Tharoor is engaging and quite humorous at times. But I do believe that the subtle humor that he has thrown in some episodes might be more appreciated by Indians who have gone through the system.Several chapters are quite boring and I almost found myself dozing and going through the pages looking out for something interesting to come by.There are some gems in the book and it does succeed in establishing a chord with you -- especially when you have yourself seen it first hand.
2,A dry and unengaging look at a vibrant country,"Shashi Tharoor's book had me flicking through the book to see how much I had left to read. The only interesting portion was from Shashi's personal recollections of his childhood, where his account really came alive; the rest was dry and statistical, reading like a CIA factbook. I could have done with less political analysis and more emphasis on what people in the street thought about India and where the country was going. A disappointing read."
2,A shallow tour of India,Doesn't go to the heart of the Indian situation. Well-written but not very insightful.
3,Hard to Rate,"It's difficult to rate this movie. For quality, I'd have to give it One Star. For effort, I'd give it Five Stars. It's basically a home movie. Some guy wrote a script, got a video camera, gathered a few of his friends together, and shot everything, I assume, in his house and back yard. All of the scenes are so tight that you can't see more than two feet either side of the camera. The ""French Quarter bar scenes,"" I suspect, were shot in his basement bar. The ""park"" and ""school"" scenes, I suspect, were shot in his back yard. There are virtually no ""extras"" or background scene people at all - just him and his friends.The acting is as you would suspect - amateur. The film quality - very grainy. However, again, you have to give the guy an A for effort. If you are looking for a high-quality movie, though, this isn't it. Oh, and by the way, there is no plot."
5,well received gift,"I just sent this to a friend's almost-6-year-old as an early birthday present. I got immediate rave reviews from her mom, who said she had just enjoyed an hour of quiet while the 6 year old and her younger almost-3-year old sister made necklaces together without any fighting!"
5,Great little set - very pretty beads!,"My neice loved this set - she received this and another set that wasn't a Melissa and Doug set. While she loved both, as a parent, I can see the quality difference immediately. The colors are very vibrant and they are very easy to string. The flower beads are adorable and there are enough beads in this set to make quite a few bracelets and necklaces. Another great Melissa and Doug product!"
3,Makes an ok gift for the right age,"My twins are too young for the bead phase. However, my niece is not and she loves beads. Beadwork requires a fair amount of raw materials such as the numerous colored beads and connectors in this kit. This can be tedious for parents to pick up after."
4,great gift for my 8 year old granddaughter.,This set was very colorful and durable beads to combine with the cords to make some very unique jewelry. It is a great gift idea for any age over 4yrs to complete several jewelry projects.Fun for the adults to join in with the young ones to suggest ideas also.
1,$99 - is someone having a laugh?,Come on - I saw this after buying an almost identical Melissa & Doug wooden bead set at a well known store for $12.99. This sort of con shouldn't be on Amazon.
4,Gift,Gave this gift to a family members daughter. She loved it. She opened it and began creating jewelry immediately. Safe and fun.
5,A Gift that keeps on giving.,"Ordered this as a present to my goddaughter and she liked it. Lots of colors to choose from and offers a variety of shapes to make different styles. Encourages self expression. May be given as gifts to friends after bracelets are made. 4 stars on durability due to nature of the end product. It is what it is. Still, item deserves 5 star rating."
3,I recommend this seller,I bought this product at the request of another person who gave this to my granddaughter and she really liked it. Delivery was on time and very good price ..
4,typical bead set,This was an extra something for a granddaughter and she loved the colors of the beads. I find most of Melissa & Doug products are well made and fun.
2,seriously?,"I'm going to give this album two stars because I feel bad for him.All the reviews I've heard or read have been brutal. It's clear Drive Thru signed this artist due to the rave reviews Conor Oberst received for ""Lifted"" and of course for the mass buzz that has surrounded his two new albums(""I'm Wide Awake.."" primarily). I have been a fan of bright eyes since ""letting off the happiness"" and this album is no Bright Eyes. If the album was released for a karaoke bar he might be ok, he does do a mediocre impersonation. However his lyrics seem to be something he stole from oberst's trash can. And again in comparison to Conor his voice may be somewhat accurate but competely uninspired. That emotion that bring songs to life is what Bright Eyes is known for and has mastered, and what An Angle lacks completely.The bottom line is unless you have never heard Oberst (which most of the Drive Thru generation hasn't) don't bother giving this album a listen.Impersonation-4 Creativity-0"
1,The sad state of the music industry,"Drive Thru records ruins its pristine reputation with this signing. Oh no, wait, they were already awful, and this just solidifies them as the worst label currently out there. How they can make such a blatant ripoff and get away with it is disgusting. Everything from the singer, to th lyrics, to the cover art, to the name of the songs. How can these guys parade around and be proud of what they bring to the table? How can they wake up every morning knowing how fake they are and live with themselves?Not to mention the album stinks. It isn't very good at all. Conor's worst written, worst recorded song is more genuine than this garbage. Stay far away from this album."
1,It's laughable.,"If this really isn't a joke, then good god. What a pathetic and blatant rip off of Bright Eyes. And no, I'm not only saying that because their voices are similar...the lyrics, song structures, titles, and even artwork are all just stolen from Conor Oberst. I was willing to give this band a chance before I listened to them, hoping that since I'd heard so much about the similarity to BE, that they would only be influenced by Bright Eyes and have talent and creativity, but I don't even like the songs, because it's as though the singer tried to paraphrase Oberst's songs and try to sell the plagiarism. It's actually kind of repulsive to see the lengths to which Kris Anaya will go. Save your money and buy a BE record instead."
1,Utterly sad,"Conor said ""meaning is sometimes hard to spot it begins with a flickering of cigarettes""apparently this guy decided to skip everything and just call one of his songs ""Flicker of A Cigarette"" and that's where it stopseverything about this screams Conor Oberst. from the art (reminiscent of A Collection of Songs; Fevers and Mirrors; Letting Off the Happiness) to the song titles (""Did You did you did you"" -->conor's will you. will you will you; ""Like a Locket, Like a Necklace, Like a Bracelet"" ---> conor's A Spindle, A Darkness, A Fever, And a Necklace;etc)It's a shame. i can't believe you can get away with this"
1,Let me repeat what has been said before. It's needed.,"This guy is sad. I have talked to him, and he ""hates"" bright eyes even though they sound identical. It's funny how he goes about doing this. He is very immature just like the album and the scheme he is trying to pull off. Which I might say could be successful. I am a huge Bright Eyes fan. I gave this CD a chance, and I couldn't help but think what is wrong with this guy. I know him a little personally and I just can't imagine how he would steal something so blatantly and still deny it. I think we all know the truth.This album doesn't sound like the new bright eyes stuff (I'm wide awake it's morning, or digital ash in a digital urn). It's more of a Fever and Mirrors Letting off the Happiness with a small hint of LIFTED.Don't buy this CD instead go buy something that is worth the money and is actually good. It doesn't take much talent to copy something."
1,This CD is horrible.,"I had a chance to listen and honestly, I was mortified. No musical talent whatsoever. Sounds like a soured version of Bright Eyes. It actually sounds like they cut up Bright Eyes lyrics and threw them up in the air and wrote a song according to what word they picked up first. Stale attempt."
1,a true waste of tape and time,"This album is stumbling trying to walk in a pair of shoes stolen from conor oberst when he was out of town.The lyrics aren't profound or as well placed as Bright Eyes. The riffs are even recycled, except switched around like no one would notice. It's hard to come off genuine when you sound like a watered down version of someone else. Conor's worst songwriting is still better than this at it's best. I just can't believe someone had the nerve to release this."
1,This Band and every member in it should be castrated,Jesus Christ people will do anything for money. . . . It is discusting . . .
1,So...,"Did he really think we wouldn't notice he's trying to copy-Conor's music-Conor's look (black hair over eyes, omgimsad look)-Conor's VOICE. I don't know how long this guy practiced to make it sound like Conor's. That's pathetic.I can't believe a respectable label like Drive Thru would sign this black market crap."
1,Gah.,"Don't get me wrong, An Angle may be a decent band... but the rip off quality is unbearable. I mean, from the tape hiss to the lyrics, it's just one big Conor clone band.It's disgusting how he obviously markets himself comparable to Conor... Ick.Go listen to Bright Eyes instead."
1,excuse me?,"please don't compare these people to Conor Oberst. They are completely ripping him off. In fact it's almost a joke, from the ""Did You, Did You, Did You"" to the necklace-bracelet-whatever track. If you like Bright Eyes then maybe you will like An Angle, but you should listen to Bright Eyes. Buy his new albums. They rule."
5,The Eclectic Voice of Angels,"The only reason one would put this disc in a box, metaphorically and literally, is to prevent scratches. It defies anything other than sheer listening. Just keep it in your cd player or iTunes rotation for a few days/weeks/months.There are hidden (and not so hidden!) treasures on this amazing disc. Stephanie continues to grow and explore the musical landscapes both domestic and foreign, and contemporary and ancient.Bookended with two ""English"" compositions, ""Rock me Amadeus"" and ""Love is a Rose""(!), the disc is balanced with exotic voice, language, rhythm and melody that demonstrates her unique ability to deliver world music that spans continents, time and genre.At times danceable and at times contemplative, there is enough variety on this disc to make me wonder if I am listening to it for the first time, just about every time I hear it!"
1,Did I read the same book as these other shills?,"This was one of the worst examples of rehashing previous consulting work and placing between two hard covers that I have ever witnessed. I have had over 20 years of strategy consulting experience with global firms, and have taught at one of the top ten business schools. I would never use this book with my students. It shifts back and forth from anecdote to cut and paste diagrams, with no structure or detailed description of the actual methodology and approaches that are used in serious market research efforts. Don't waste your time."
2,Market Research,I finally give up on finishing this book. It talk about strategic anticipation which sounded greate however it never said anything about how or what to do.
5,Something for everyone,"I picked up this book immediately after September 11. I haven't read a lot about Islam. I understand that most Muslims are actually MORE fundamentalist than Jerry Falwell.Al-Azmeh explains Islam in a way that most Westerners will not be threatened by. And he makes no effort to apolgize for its fundamentalist incarnation. He has two recommendations for Muslims: (a) accept that the world really is secular/Christian; (b) don't bother with a literal interpretation of the Qur'an. He also points out that certain famous Western intellectuals liked aspects of Islam (Kant, Goethe).If you have foresight enough to want to see everyone get along, you can't do better than starting with this book."
4,they work,"I have used many (3) packs of blades purchased at Lowes for about $20.25 including sales tax. Almost all the time they work perfect. Recently, I purchased a pack that was defective and had to return them to the store. The blades were slightly too large. I could fit a used blade inside the new blade very snug. Usually when you put a blade inside another, there is a gap where the inner blade bends inward, because it is the same size as the other blade and cannot fit inside it perfectly. Although the blades were close, the difference in size led to them slipping excessively. I have only experienced this one time, but have purchased a pack before where the blades seemed tight."
2,professional painter,"This is a knuckle scraper, not a paint scarper. The handle is angled too low to avoid dragging your knuckles across the wood. A huge disappointment! It will, however, remove the paint along with your skin."
4,Klaatu is Awesome!,"Klaatu returns to form with this wonderfully melodic album, with orchestral pieces and vocal harmonies throughout. If you've never listened to Klaatu, this is as great a place to start as 3:47EST or Hope. One of the most overlooked bands EVER and one of my all time favs."
2,Maybe I'll Move to Mars...,"""Maybe I'll Move to Mars""... The only song worth more than 1 listen IMHO.Love that one (kinda like the old daze.)Too bad the rest wasn't more like it.The rest just leaves me feeling nothing at all really."
5,Purcell's Dido & Aeneas,"I like the style of music, The performance seems first-rate. Purcell's music should receive better recognition. We spend so much on public education, and yet so few students get to know composers like Purcell, Telemann and Vivaldi."
2,"Eh, I've seen better","More horrible than horror, it reeks of low budget and limited imagination. I bought it on the strength of all the reviews posted here but couldn't find any of the attributes they raved about. I found little to compare it to Scream (as in, it wouldn't stand up to a plagiarism lawsuit). One small element in common isn't enough to condemn either project on the grounds of originality, or lack thereof. Strictly amateur; it even fails on the level of a curio.I'm still trying to decide if I'm at least glad I watched it this one time. At any rate, it isn't a keeper!"
2,Strictly amateur,"Aside from having a lead character that watches movies, I didn't see any other similarities between this film and Scream. The film was neither a comedy nor a horror film. I spent more time laughing AT the film than I did laughing with the film."
2,Boring.....early 1950's drive in movie,The movie was not as alluded too. Very early 50's style and extremely boring. The man in the frog suit should have his frog legs barbequed and the rest buried as was the whole movie.
1,Beware - Company places unremovable sticker on knife,"This is a fine putty knife, but for some reason the company decided to place a sticker on the knife that cannot be easily removed. When you use the knife, the sticker makes it hard for the spackle or putty to come off the knife and flecks of the sticker end up in the putty. Quite annoying. Would not recommend and would not buy again. Also, I called the company and they said to soak it in soap and water. Quite an extra chore to prepare your $5 dollar putty knife."
5,Excellent value for money,"This album is a reissue of the recording done in the eighties and, I believe, is still among the best interpretations of Beethoven's symphonies. The performance is amzingly crisp and clear. You will not regret if you buy this set."
4,Hogwood Good,"I'm one of those Beethoven fanatics who has all the period recordings of Beethoven's nine symphonies, or most of them anyway. I've got Norrington, Gardiner, Bruggen, the Hanover Band and Hogwood. Between the five, I could assemble a definitive ""period"" set. They all have strengths and weaknesses, but Hogwood and his forces could hold their own over the course of the nine. I enjoyed symphonies 1, 2, 4, 5 & 7.If you are looking for one good set, with solid sound at a great price, this is it. Nevertheless, the Hanover Band recordings on Nimbus, originally won me over. Before them, the modern orchestra frankly bored me with their Beethoven, and I hadn`t heard the other period specialists yet.My favorites ~*The Hanover Band*Franz Bruggen and the Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century*Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music*John Elliot Gardiner and the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique*Roger Norrington and the London Classical Players"
4,It was a thrilling and extravagent book,It was a thrilling and extravagent book that was full of suspense and horror. It kept me reading it all the way to the end.
4,"the reissue of a 1985 Erato CD: fine music and music-making, short TT","This is the reissue of an Erato CD released in 1985. See my review under the original issue:Handel:Ballet Music. The music, excerpted from Alcina and the earlier Il Pastor Fido (Terpsichore is the one-act opera-ballet Haendel added as an opening to the much-revised revival of 1734), is as good as anything Haendel ever wrote (especially the overture and ballet music from Alcina) and the English Baroque Soloists under Gardiner play with fine tone and ensemble and genuine Haendelian zest. The only drawback is the short TT of 47:23, and no subsequent reissue (there is alsoHandel: Ballet Music, and a 6-CD box collating a number of Gardiner Haendel Erato recordings,Handel: L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato; Tamerlano; Ballet Music From Alcina, Terpischore & Il Pastor Fido / Gardiner (6CDs)) has complemented the original recording with an adequate filler. So find it cheap."
4,Philips- vM (Modification),"The sound is of this machine is very good, in stereo and surround. Very high value for your money.But with a Van Medevoort modification (200 euro) it sounds better then brilliant. The about 100 Van Medevoort modifications are on componentlevel and mechanical.Contact them on www.vanmedevoort.com, for your local reseller."
1,PHILIPS DVD963SA DVD / SACD Player,"This appears to be another in a long line of Phillips products that are not built to function properly or last. This is in keeping with their previous products starting with EGA (Magnavox) monitors, CD-R Drives and software, and even their PC speaker/soound cards and TV remote controls. Everything seems to be low quality with a short lifespan."
2,"Tedious, Roach phones in his music for this one",Roach has done some great things but this album is little more than him noodling on a guitar that has been super processed through synthesizers. It would be a nice effect if he had any musical idea to put across but there is none. The point of this album seems to be the noise effect and nothing else. Sound effects for their own sake. Dull.
2,emotionally disappointing,"'Sorry folks, but I just don't see it. The other reviewers seem duly impressed, but I've now played this work several times and get nothing very positive *emotionally* out of it. Technically it may be a masterwork, but it makes me feel edgily negative from start to finish. Playing it late at night just before turning in was most depressing (but then again, maybe that's the point, in a strange sort of way...)! Given the several other Roach albums I own (and I like all of these a good deal) I was most hopeful, but as far as I'm concerned, this one is a bomb. If, however, you are a student of ambient soundscapes *per se,* I suppose you might well see things differently: sonically, at least, it really is delightful."
1,What Steve sounds like when he's not playing keyboards...,"Yawn, had I known that there were no keyboards at all on this cd, I would have never bought it. What is on this disc is 7 very boring/droning fine-for-meditation tracks featuring processed guitar noodlings. And if that's not bad enough, too many repetative chords further increases your tendancy to reach for the stop button on your cd player. Buy at your own risk."
2,Cold & scary,"I love many of the CD's I've bought from Amazon's Best of New Age list for 1999 & 2000 -- most are excellent, some are great. Steve Roach's Midnight Moon, however, is a huge disappointment. The music is cold and almost scary. The picture it evokes is of traveling in darkest space to a unwelcoming, eery place. Musically, it may be excellent, but I dislike it's steely tones."
5,A Great translation of the Bible,"I love the message, contrary to popular opinion, Eugene Peterson has done an excellent job. I believe he has faithfully tranlsated the Scriptures. It is a great Bible to read for devotions, but i also admit that you need a bit more depthy Bible to study from. But it is a breat of fresh air when you read it. I can feel the emotions through the words chosen by Eugene Peterson. I am able to give it to non-Christians to read and they love it because it appeals to them.It is an excellent paraphrase and just because it's a bit different to normal translations, it is still great for getting the overall message of the Bible. Keep an open mind while you read it, because it will challenge you, but don't right it off just because it's a bit different."
4,Above Average - Quite Tasty,"This is not the best dried chicken noodle soup I have had, but it is very good and better than most. I tried this because I love the Bear Creek Potato Soup - It Is The Best!!. But my personal preference for the dried chicken noodle soup is the Alessi brand. I would say that this comes in a close second. I made it according to directions and then stirred in a small can (about 6 oz) of cooked white meat chicken. Made it a little heartier. I would buy this again if Alessi wasn't available."
1,Boring as heck!,"I saw other rave reviews about it and thought it would be fantastic...boy was I ever wrong...I read several pages and still the same ol' thing...had to put it down...couldn't take such a boring uninteresting, uninspiring book...Save your money..don't buy this book."
2,NOT AS DESCRIBED,"THE BAG SAYS MORNINGSONG FRUIT, BERRY, AND NUTS BLEND, WHICH IS GREAT, THE SONG BIRDS LOVE IT!WHEN IT ARRIVES IT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. IT IS JUST FRUIT AND NUT BLEND, WHICH THE SONGBIRDS DON'T LIKE AT ALL AND IT DRAWS SQUIRRELS ANS BLACK BIRDS.AMAZON GAVE ME FREE SHIPPING LABELS TO SEND THE BAGS BACK, BUT TOTING 75 POUNDS OF BIRD SEED TO UPS IS NO EASY TASK WHEN YOU ARE IN YOUR SIXTIES.THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME IT HAS HAPPENED. AMAZON NEEDS TO GET THEIR BAG SELECTION RIGHT."
1,Same as what I buy at Ace!,"I must have been on drugs, I seriously thought I was buying 40lbs for $29. I was disappointed it looked the same as my bird feed from Ace except there were nuts in the Scott's. The delivery took awhile so I purchased 50lbs from Ace and created about the same mixture as the Scott's forabout $30 less. I will write a review in 30 days on this product."
2,Nice frame but.....,"The frame seems to be the only thing of any quality on this bike. I have owned this for three months so far and have had to replace the shifter, derailer, brakes and other small items. This bike is NOT Schwinn's usual quality. Very disapointing"
5,"Awesome bath toy, even to use with other toys!","We love the racing around one, but they do sell other versions, like dinosaurs and other ones. This thing floats and holds other toys on it and is the best bath toy we have had and we had many since this is my fourth kid and oldest is now almost 13! It is shaped to accommodate the body in the middle when its in front of you. Bath after bath it still looks new. The squirt toys are better than most. My problem with squirt toys is when you don't get all the liquid out, you get slime with the liquid when it finally comes out, and it gets the kids upset to see this in the tub. These do better than most. It covers transportation in general, but no trains, just police and fire vehicles and stations and airport and boat. This was for a 2 yr old. He asked where the train was, not sure why no train. I would buy these for gifts. The price is reasonable. Even my 7 year old wants to use."
4,CUTE TUB TOYS...,"I bought these for my 2 and 3-year old sons who love cars and trucks. It's a great alternative to the usualy cutesy squirt toys that you buy (sea animals, ducks, etc.) My sons don't play with the mat a whole lot, mostly just the squirt toys. A basic tub toy, but No complaints here."
4,Fun tub toy,My 2 year old son loves tub toys. This new addition is a hit. He plays with the cars on the track and around the tub. It is durable and encourages imaginative play driving the cars around town. I do wish their weren't holes in the cars that fill with water and can get moldy. But there are a lot of cars and boats so I just put a few away for later use.
3,decent toy,My son (recently turned 2) loves cars and trucks. This toy really got him excited about bath time. Although he quickly got rid of the track and just liked pushing the cars around the top of the bath tub. Half of the fun is having me fill up the cars with water and squirt them at him.I probably should have gotten him something he could stick to the wall of the tub (like the alphabet or numbers) but I was too scared he would fall down like he's done once before.
5,"Fun for tots, amusing for adults.","This book was a winner with my 3 and 5 year old boys! We have re-read this one almost as often as Green Eggs and Ham, and Cat in the Hat. I think the appeal for the little ones is the plain silliness. The Little Knights owe more to the Keystone Kops than to Arthur's Table Round; cute slapstick of a non-violent medeival sort. (The castle seige is really a food fight.) The visual gags and extra mini-games and detail on each page keep the VERY simple story from getting old too fast for anyone old enough to read. My 3 year-old can recite the book verbatim. NOTE: There is a CD-Rom by Fisher Price out there that compliments the ""Brave Knights"" theme and characters. Equally cute and popular with my small boys, but difficult to locate. Probably out of print, but worth the search."
4,good performance for interior leveling,I purchased this level to complete a twelve room acoustical ceiling project. It was easy to use and very dependable for interior work. The largest room was 25' x 44' and the line showed up acceptably. Then we went to a porch rebuild. We quickly put it back in the case as it was complelety ineffective outside ( and we were in the shade ).
5,so close to the look,I bought a number of these for my tree and then repainted them to match my 7 pets so they would be on the tree. My mother is dieing and my husband just did so this has been my therapy my nest has been empty for a while so my pets are important. the figures were well painted before I re painted them but I wanted them more personal
1,A tool to study jewish ceremonies,"I was faily dissapointed since I expected the authors to actually show the connection they claim they've discovered between the feasts and the comings of Jesus Christ. Old Testament does indeed point to Jesus more often than not, so the title was quite intriguing. What the book does offer though is a totally different matter. Starts out with the description of the sacrificial ceremonies and priest garments etc... As an introduction it's ok, and maybe it's even useful to know, but this goes on for chapters and chapters. I think there's only one chapter dedicated specifically to discussing Revelation and feasts, where the authors incourage you to do your own study. Hm.. The other thing is they bring certain accounts into the book and don't reveal the sources. Not a good thing to do when dealing with understanding the Bible. I wish I understood what the other readers liked about the book."
5,They brought the Old and New Testament into compatibility.,"The understanding of the feasts and how they affect the Jesus of the New Testament is surely a revelation sent by God to open the minds of the people of today. According to Col. 1:26, even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of Glory.I believe the Lord has poured out his spirit upon these authors as was prophesied in Joel 2:28. Their words of understanding of the scriptures and the words of wisdom and their faith in the Lord is truly a gift from God. These authors have spent 20 years of searching for the truth of the feasts and what they have to do with the latter days. It is my opinion that they have brought the Old Testament and the New Testament into compatible assurance that God's word is neverending and shall not pass away."
2,Enter at own risk,"Upgraded from QB 2004 pro as we needed to add another user and 2004 is not available any more. Kept getting errors trying to convert the file to new system. When we finally got it installed and in working condition, the system is SLOW. Transactions can take a while to complete, just opening the program takes a few mins as well. This is with just two people connected. If I had the choice we would still be running 2004 as the new database system seems to be sluggish, probably 2-3x as slow as it used to be at times."
2,Upgrade is a major problem,"Updating from 2003 version which I like. Had major problems with my Server and QuickBooks. Repeated lengthy calls to support in India gave me nothing but frustration. Everything they suggested was more and more work for me (I'm talking hours)and I do not believe they ever understood. Now, from another source, I find the problem stems from their data base server design which is new for 2006. I am using the sytem in a very awkward procedure until my outsource IT specialize comes to fix. The new version has some nice new feature but I truly miss the simplicity of working with the older version. If I had the choice to do it again I would pass."
4,Great option for small businesses,"This item is much easier to use than Peachtree, and works great for the standard functionality of small businesses. It has everything you need to get the ball moving and keep it moving. Despite other complaints of slow processing with the new database engine, we have experienced no issues. The software and database engine is installed on a single processor server with 1GB of RAM and the clients are installed on P4 3.0GHz with 512MB RAM. Everything runs without a hitch."
2,For age 8 to 12,"The books starts by giving pretty good information about materials and basics, which is ideal to start with.Additionally, it is entirely colored and gives some pretty good tips regarding general body proportions and positions.However by looking a little bit closer, we can see that the style is not really manga-like and some of the characters present severe disproportions and lack of depth.Still, most of the linearts are pretty well done and if not for the sloppy coloring, the book might have been a good introduction for total beginners.In conclusion:Pros-Good guidelines on basics-Detailed explanations on how to obtain a decent lineartCons-Characters are not really manga-like-Sloppy colorwork-No real instruction on actual coloring-Disproportions in characters faces and sometimes in their bodies-Very short book"
4,Nice watch,"My husband went to OSU, so I bought this watch for him. He loved it! The only complaint that he had about it was the PVC band. He really did not like it at all. We ended up going to the store and buying a $12 leather band for it. If you're unsure about the plastic band, add the cost of a new band in your budget. Also, the lady at the store had a really hard time getting changing out the band. The watch itself seems to work just fine."
3,Good Starter Book,This small book is very good for the person who already has an understanding of crystal and or rock growth. It gives general ideas about identifying but you still can't be sure til you learn the ropes of light refraction and growth patterns along with hardness scales.
5,Wht I expected,Want to learn more about precious stones. This is your book without a doubt. Great place for beginners to start the journey into gems.
1,Moldy Pears and Masters of the Obvious,"""The Trouble With Pears""... is that it's horrid. For years I've been fascinated by the story of Erzebet and I found this book painfully dull and poorly written. The dialogue is stiff, the action is...nonexistant. I felt as though I was reading a book thrown together by a high school student. It might as well have been called, ""What I Did On Summer Vacation."" Murder shouldn't be spoken of with the same zest as the colour of a dress. Even the sympathy plea for Erzebet isn't an original concept.If you're incredibly bored and feel inclined to read entire paragraphs on how breathing is necessary or how servant girls open doors, then be my guest, give it a read. But then, what can one expect of a book who's cover features a fuzzy photograph of an action figure?"
1,The Rotten Pear,"I've long been fascinated with the Countess, and purchased this in hopes of an engrossing historical fiction. Fiction it is solely. It is also singularly CRAP. The prose are terrible and ill constructed.In short, this is a waste of time and money. So, don't do it."
5,A constant pleasure,"A collection of overtures to operas written by a Baroque composer whose name is well known but whose music is lesser known may not be high on everyone's 'want' list, but I urge you to take a chance on this CD. I obtained this disc as part of a 15-free-CDs introductory offer to a mail order CD club but it has turned out to be a pleasant surprise. This is music that seems to get better the more you hear it and ruminate over it afterward. Rameau is obviously a composer of considerable ingenuity and resource. These ouvertures positively bubble with effervescence and there is a refreshing lack of sameness among them. The period instrument group Les Talens Lyrique (named after one of the ouvertures on this CD) are obviously enthusiastic about this music and their playing is a joy. There is an appealing, analogue-like warmth about the recording, too."
5,Cold heat,"The French Baroque Roccoco School of music has suffered in comparison to the most vibrant Italian competition, or Bach and Handel dexterity and brilliance, not to mention soul enhancing character of their works. That is unfortunate since some of the graduates of that French period like Rameau have a record that is far from insignificant. But Rameau wrote for a public that liked mental games, was more subdued and courtly. The fire had to be contained. But the intelligence and brilliance did not have to be contained. If you want to be convinced of this, do yourself a favor and get this record. I will warn you, you might need to listen to it a few times, to let it grow on you, but next thing you know you might be purchasing some of these great operas. Oh! And the quality of the recording is impeccable, though a little bit low for my taste."
2,Just not very good,"I've heard a lot about what a great, visual writer Bonansinga is and I really wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't get into it. It is filled with inconsistencies and labored writing that just doesn't grab the reader and drag him or her along the way a great thriller is supposed to do. It isn't very thrilling--in fact, it's rather boring, with the main idea never very clearly delineated or developed. The lead character, FBI profiler Ulysses Grove, isn't a very compelling character, yet he seems to be the protagonist in a series of books that follow this one. I read this after coming across a rave review, but I consciously had to force myself to keep reading (I should have given up and gone on to something else, but just kept going, hoping it would get better, but it never did). The negative reviews here do a good job of outlining the book's many flaws, though I think it's better than a one-star review. Not much better, though."
3,not one of tierney's best,"I bought this as a gift and the recipient was pleased.I sort of thought the colors of the clothing were washed out looking - not clear and distinct.You can see what I'm talking about by the pics of the front cover. The black isn't very black, the skin tones are flat.I also have to wonder how accurate the outfits really are. We compared Princess Diana wedding dresses in 3 different paperdoll books and each version was a little different. It would be nice to have a historically correct representation.Anyway, a nice thing about this book is the back inside cover. There you will find a paragraph or two about each of the royal wedding couples inside."
1,POOR QUALITY,"First this is nothing like the item I received. Plus the two blades don't even come close to cutting even a piece of paper. Very, very disappointing."
5,trimmer,this is good to have to keep your bonsai tree looking good. It is a convienient size and easy to handle.
2,Disappointing purchase,"The trimmer looked used with rust on the blades. I believe I paid for a new product. So, I was not pleased with the quality of the purchase ."
1,Need a closure,"The bonsai trimmer in the photo is NOT the one I received... And there is no closure, leaving the blades open at all times and dangerous to carry.""running with scissors""Very Disappointed"
3,They do ok,"They are ok for $5, I would rather now have just saved the $5 and used it toward a whole set as I need more a set than just one clipper."
2,Arrived in Poor Condition,"Received the trimmer recently and, to my dismay, noticed that the clippers were in poor condition. Parts of the handle area have the paint/coating chipped off and it is scratched up all over, the clippers punctured the small plastic holder it comes with, and there is a water or oil stain on the barcode sticker that could indicates that the product could have been previously used. Since it was only about $5, I'm not going to try to return it or anything as it is only an addition to the bonsai tree that I'm giving my father for Christmas, but I am disappointed in the condition that this clipper came in."
5,Has helped me conquer my fears,"Clear, well-organized, strong advice for the weak-at-knees over public speaking. I am suddenly finding myself called upon to ""go public,"" and I was not very good. Ms. Witz's book has made all the difference. I am confident I shall succeed now."
1,This book is way over-rated.,The information given in the book is very shallow and most of the book consists of lists of essential oil suppliers. Some of the phone numbers are incorrect. I would NOT recommend this book.
3,A good complement to instruction...,"The illustrations in the book are great and easy to follow, but won't be much use to absolute beginners. I recommend this as a reminder or a sort of ""cheat sheet"" for people who have had instruction or at the very least have a video/dvd. Without having seen the movements demonstrated properly it will be hard to learn from this book."
2,RETURNED IT,Dis not like.not the best I bought. lid mismatched after one use..so didn't perk rightbuy one without attached lid
3,Not bad - for the price,Coffee maker is well made except for poorly designed lid. If you are looking for a Perc don't let this stop you from making the purchase. Coffee is HOT! and pot is always clean compared to our Kitchen-Aid drip machine. I prefer the PERCOLATOR!
1,Don't make the same mistake...,"This percolator is trash. I made the mistake of purchasing two, as I thought ""what could possibly go wrong with a percolator? It is such a simple design; nothing could possibly go wrong."" It is marketed as a ""nine-cup"" percolator, but is nothing more than a festering piece of garbage. Whenever I fill the water at, or below, the nine-cup line on the percolator, coffee spills from the lid and stains the oven, the countertops, etc. For a time, I put a paperweight on the lid, in hopes that it would remedy the problem, but the coffee still continues to pour out of the top, and the lid (which doesn't snap into place, but just ""rests"" above the percolator delicately) always lifts up and spills coffee all over the God-damned place. So, in the end, I put this percolator where it belonged: in the trash. And, if you are also interested in making your garbage lighter, then do not purchase this item: it is a headache and a mess."
4,If you love recording you'll love this.,"Once again Larry Crane and the Tape Op squad have brought forward a refreshing compilation of interviews that look at the work-a-day world of recording music for the love of it. It is nice to read about ordinary people who just do it because they need to. And big names that just do it because they need to. Its not a job it's a calling if you will.If you are just starting out as a musician looking to record or are someone who has been to the mountain but forgotten what got you started on the journey, this is for you. If you want to read how the latest number one with a bullet was recorded or if you want incredibly deep technical info then maybe this isn't for you. Not that there isn't technical info here but this is more about the passion of recording not the super-techno-babble of it. So fill your passion tank and stop feeling like your alone in the world and drop the greenbacks on a worthwhile read.Tape Op rocks."
5,An Ellis Island Christmas,"If you Could bring one thing to a place you've never been to, what would you bring? Well in ""An Ellis Island Christmas"" a six year old girl is going to America and she can only bring one of her two dolls. So, she brings her favorite doll to America. On her journey she always asks',"" when are we going to get there."" When they finally got to America she only misses two things, her house and her doll that she supposudly left at home. After her family gets through the tent and are American Citizens, Krysia, the girl, gets one present from her mom for Christmas. I bet you could guess what it is."
5,DID the write thing!,"Are there any more STARS? Five is not enough for Nina & Kwame's latest endeavor! This passionate step-by step guide through the sometimes-dangerous jungles of publishing is like your mother taking you by the hand and teaching you to look both ways before crossing the street. Much respect to Kwame, for once again lending us, yet another side of his talented range."
4,"simple,moving","this is a story of a girl(lindy webster) who is caught in the web of youngteenage discontent. lindy simply does not know ""what"" to do with herself!?!?lindy's older sister is an excellent dancer and student but,what can lindy do?-nothing. one day she finds a forgotten carousel in an old building. lindy feels an affinity with the wooden animals and this is the place she likes to sneak off toto,be alone and sort out her feelings.the gist of this story is lindy finding HER place in the world and she doesdiscover,she is exactly where she is supposed to be.nice afternoon reading."
1,Not as depicted,The item as pictured is excellent. Unfortunately the item shipped has a wobbly retractable blade. I placed an order on another site and received the same substitution. I've looked every where on the internet and locally and I don't believe Red Devil makes this exact product any longer.
2,Paint scraper review,"I wanted a paint scraper that would take utility knife blades, since we have some scraping jobs these are better for than single edge razor blade. Unfortunately, this scraper does not take a standard utility blade, it takes one with an extra hole in it, so it's utility is quite limited."
4,happy,"I love: Opium, Never Fall In Love, Fluer de saison, Alicia, My Only Friend and En cendres, Annie and Le...Amant. The other tracks are almost unlistenable to me. I am happy she is back with a new album but I also feel like her first album is better than this one. All the tracks on her first album are wonderful."
4,Simple but tasty,"A book I keep in the kitchen for quick dinners. You have to have an asian pantry, but if you do the ideas you will find here will be easy to put together."
2,Fine if you go all out,"I was disappointed with this book because too many of the recipes are not self contained, but rather require you use ""Special Sauce #1"" or ""Special Sauce #2"". What if I don't want to make a big batch of your special sauce (that intentionally creates more than for just one recipe). I want to be able to see a recipe and follow it to produce a dish for that night. I own a lot of thai cookbooks. This one does not see the light of day."
1,Both girls hated them,"I have an almost 4 year old and an 18 month old. When my oldest was a baby we tried every flavor of the meals and she hated every single one of them. We had hoped for better luck with my second but she too will not eat these. She'll eat some of the veggies, but spits out the entree."
1,BEING BEAUTIFUL INSIDE & OUT,"Unbelievably amateurish, adding insult to injury of having paid the full price for this.. there's even misspelling within the programme (eg. er.. hint: ""Protein"" is correct spelling..), plus typos on the cover.. the 1st review can only be a shameless plug by friend / family ""World Reowned..Top Model"" (yeah, right..)Ms. Crouch.. otherwise impossible for anyone to be that blind to this desperately poor production.. even when making allowance for it aimed at impressionable / not-supposed-to-be-sophisticated teenager wannabe models, this regrettable episode is truly utterly appalling & low IQ.."
1,"Yes, it's that bad.","It's interesting to note that Sheryl Crow completely opted out of the opening solo guitar riff for Sweet Child O' Mine - despite the fact that the intro is what everyone thinks of when they think of the song! Without the fast pace, great guitar riff, and Axl's voice, this is a very weak song indeed. The original is great because it's the perfect blend of hard rock/metal with sweet screeching by Axl and guitar work and lovely lyrics. The only thing here are the lovely lyrics - sung by Crow without any intensity at all.If you want a good slow cover of the song, check out Slowdive's - at least they included the solo. No, nothing will ever, EVER compare with the original...including Slowdive's...but at least their version is fun to listen to, and relaxing, whereas this is just grating."
3,Not Quite,A good value except that there were practice balls included...It was not stated there would be any in the batch...that was disappointing.
2,Not great quality,"Overall quality was not ""like new"" . There were several marked , off colored, and scuffed balls included among the better quality balls."
2,"Some good, some bad","I don't care about some having logos, old pen marks or even a small scuff.My issue is that some of these balls clearly have been recovered w/ an inferior surface. Most the balls have the soft surface of pro v1, however a handful have the surface of a top flight (slick). Clearly they've been recovered w/ something much cheaper.Not sure I'd buy these again."
4,Excellent Value on Used Titleists,"Manage your expectations and you won't be disappointed.Three dozen new ProV series balls - even during the holiday sale season - would run you $120 (+tax). These used balls go for approximately half that and are worth every penny for those of us who would rather spend $5 on the beer cart than that next slice off the tee.The balls were clean and largely in excellent condition. They came loosely packed in a cardboard box...utilitiarian packaging, nothing fancy. Approximately half of the balls had slight scuffing/scratching to prove that they weren't brand new (we're not talking cart path bouncers, but the kind of marking you'd get after playing a few holes). Most of the balls (85%?) bore logos. If that bothers you, this won't be your kind of deal, but I personally like it...kinda interesting and makes it easy to ID your ball.Bottom line: Great value for expensive branded balls."
5,Great for building vocabulary,This set is expensive but worth the value for children with Autism or delayed speakers. It includes several categories for learning. The first is the object with a white background and then it builds to objects in a natural setting and then similar objects so your child can learn variety. There is also a section for shapes and color as well as matching items. My autistic son is 2 and is just learning to speak and these have been a wonderful tool to motivate his speech. This product is crucial to implementing Applied Behavior Anyalysis.
1,"don't buy it, it is a scam.. it is not worth the cost of $250, my two year old can take better pics","don't buy it, it is a scam.. it is not worth the cost of $250, my two year old can take better pics....this is supposed to be for ABA therapy, what a waste of $$$. I feel that I have been robbed by both Amazon and the dealer..."
4,Practical gift for a coffee lover,The long handle comes in handy when getting coffee out of those small bags. The coffee drinkers in my family enjoyed getting this in their stocking.
4,Good scoop,Right amount for a good cup of coffee. No problems and quite sturdy. I bought this to use with my Keurig replacement filter so I could use regular coffee instead of the more expensive K-cups.
4,"Tea Tree Oil works, but watch what you're getting...","I will echo other reviews I've seen of Tea Tree Oil in general. I was turned onto the stuff by family recently, as a ""cure"" for athlete's foot or nail fungal infections, and it's worked for me too. It works quickly, and with none of the side effects I've noticed from the usual OTC medicines. The only possible down-side is the smell of the oil - it doesn't bother me, and isn't noticeable for long, but when the bottle is open you can't miss it!On this particular vendor's offering, I do need to note the following: Although the product description and image indicate that you'll receive a bottle containing 4 fl. oz. of tee tree oil, the one I received was a mere 3.6 fl. oz. It may not seem like much, but when you're comparing prices and .5 oz can cost $4-5, it is a problem."
5,Intelligent and humane in the best of senses,"Probably the most intelligent book I've read. Don't know if that says much, but still..."
2,disappointing,"While this book has good parts, they are completely countered by Pinker's theory that the humans are the exact OPPOSITE of a blank slate. I would highly recommend, for an alternate and more credible viewpoint, the works Of George H. Weinberg (sometimes listed without the ""H""), particularly his books THE PLIANT ANIMAL and SELF-CREATION.And I've read the works of the highly regarded Erich Fromm, who gives statistics that show small tribal units do NOT engage in violence in nearly the proportions that more sizable populations do. Which counters Pinker's argument that humans are violent in all situations. Maybe Fromm is wrong...but maybe he's right."
1,Where's the science?,"I firmly believe in the role of genetics in the evolution human nature so I would normally be receptive to Pinker's reasoning. But his continued ad hominem attacks on so called ""radical scientists"" such as Stephen Jay Gould and Steven Rose seemed misplaced, even petty. I have read both ""Wonderful Life"" by Gould as well as ""Lifelines"" by Rose and quite frankly, I found them to be far more scholarly and informative than this rambling diatribe by Pinker. In this book as well as in Pinker's ""How the Mind Works,"" you begin to wonder not ""Where's the beef"" but rather, ""Where's the science?"""
2,oh really?,"Oh really Mr Pinker?If this book is a ""political work"" then Pinker should make it explicitly so.If it is intended philosophically, it is just plain bad.If it is a scientific piece it is marginal.I recommend that Pinker SHOULD make a political case for his ideas (much like the late Carl Sagan).Actually, if you really want to read socio-biology E.O Wilson is much better place to start.Please folks don't be fooled."
1,A rampant polemicist,"A previous review, dougrhon,wrote: ""The ultimate conclusion of the theory that society creates personality is that society can re-make personalities as it sees fit. Pinker shows how this has led to disastrous experimentation on children and adults alike. In its worst manifestation, it leads to the mass murder of a Pol Pot or Mao Tse Tung.""How about if we rephrased it thus:""The ultimate conclusion of the theory that genes create personality is that we can re-make personalities as we see fit. Pinker doesn't show how this has led to disastrous experimentation on children and adults alike. In its worst manifestation, it leads to the mass murders of a Hitler."""
3,Good but too long and too precise,"I loved the common sense approach, but it did not capture my immagination.Maybe this is a sign of really good science, but not what I want in a book I read for fun.I think perhaps he was too clear in his supporting arguments. They are so perfectly stated, and so obviously right, that there were no discoveries for me to make on my own."
2,Theoretical Science,"The book started okay in describing many illogical assumptions on human nature. But it goes on to argue reason with reason and ultimately makes no point of any value. So long as we do not relate back to the stone age, what harm is there to assume the best from the simplest of us? It is one long (very long) academic essay that can be appreciated more for its research than for any original insight."
3,Nothing Really New,"This book consists of concepts that have already been formulatd such as Carl Jung's denial of infants having a ""blank mind"" o a ""tabula rasa"" or a blank slab wen they are born. This was said before 1950 wy is Pinker credititng himself with this discovery? There is some useful an interesting information in this book."
2,Opinionated,"Too opinionated a book. Few believe the mind is a blank slate. But Pinker seems to believe the mind is a TV dinner, and that a chef in the kitchen (parents!) is an almost incidental redundancy.To take a trivial example to counter this, David Letterman once had on his TV show identical twins who only met in middle-age. Well, they weren't exactly identical, because one was quite fat, and the other quite thin!! Now if identical twins are so much alike that--as Pinker states--some of them (Pinker wants to give the impression that it's ALL of them) end up vacationing in the same spot, even if seperated at birth, certainly these two twins on Letterman would have had the same body build!!"
1,Baby jesus,"I don't get it. Pinker is a nativist, right? Does that mean he likes to celebrate Christmas? And why does he have to write so many books about it? We all know it's the 25th of December and commemorates Santa Claus' birth. Go do some research Pinker!"
2,attacking a straw man is never difficult,"Had this book been written thirty years ago, it would have really been a major contribution. The claim that human nature is not a blank slate is now so widely accepted that Pinker has nothing new to say and this book largely restates the thesis of his last book, How the Mind Works. In fact, aside from the humanities, academic research has now gone so far in the direction of emphasizing the importance of genes that an environmental correction might be necessary now. I was very disappointed in how stale the book seems."
2,"Philosophical and rhetorical, but not scientific...","This book has good assumptions, but it lacks scientific data. Many arguments employ observations that are inconclusive at best in their ""cause-effect"" nature. For example, the reference about gay men having smaller nucleus in the anterior hypothalamus, is still much a debatable conjecture. Many examples in the book are just too suspicious to be taken seriously.Overall, this book is too poorly researched, and its reasoning too puerile, for any mature readers to stay engaged."
1,Poor Pricing Policy,If I could give zero stars I would. $11 for a paperback but $15 for the Kindle download? This must be collusion at its best.
2,disappointing,"While this book has good parts, they are completely countered by Pinker's theory that the humans are the exact OPPOSITE of a blank slate. I would highly recommend, for an alternate and more credible viewpoint, the works Of George H. Weinberg (sometimes listed without the ""H""), particularly his books THE PLIANT ANIMAL and SELF-CREATION."
2,Heavy. Heavy. Heavy.,"Ok - firstly let me state that this is actually a great book - if you are studying the subject in great depth. As a casual reader the book is way too heavy.Everything I read, I agreed with. Steven gives a great coverage of the subject and if he ever decided to create a condensed version for the casual reader, thenI'd be first in line to buy it.After one Honors degree and a Doctorate, I'd prefer not to have to study too in depth to understand Mr Pinker's theories - and perhaps I missed something if he has already created an introduction to the subject?All in all, this is a great book for the professional - and as such I would rate it as a ""5"". For the casual reader - i.e. me - it is a 2.If Steven ever reads this then my recommendation is to either write the book for the amateur - or direct us to the one you have already written."
5,Is what it is,"There are enough reviews here already, I suppose. But I will warn you that this book is readable and very approachable for the undergraduates. That is part of what makes it so good. This is not just for professional academics. I think it succeeds admirably in what it wants to do. And even if cultural biology is a viable field of endeavor that supplants evolutionary psychology, its need to make factors other than human nature look primary will always be suspect -- and rightfully so."
5,A masterpiece against the politically correct dumbness,"Warning - this is a very dense and long book, but you should not be afraid, Pinker's style allows the reader to progress at his own pace while keeping really clear and pleasant during the whole book."
5,Nature vs. Nurture,"A must read! Throughout this book, Pinker shows a thorough knowledge of a wide variety of fields, covering from neuroscience to politics to philosophy and much more. This book argues against the premise that the human brain begins as an empty tablet awaiting the experiences of life to teach it how to think and act. It's the ""nature versus nurture"" question revisited- but this time both sides win. You have to read the book to see what I mean."
2,Pinker continually distorts his opposition,"The fact that nobody actually beleives in the idea that humans are a blank slate doesn't stop Pinker from acting as if they do. Over and over again in this book, Pinker quotes his purported opposition and follows up his quotation with an interpretation which is clearly a distortion.This book is merely a diatribe: I can read ""adaptionist"" books with great pleasure when they are written by people with some subtelty of mind--Richard Dawkins or EO Wilson, say. But Pinker, either through willfulness or incapacity, utterly misses the nuance in arguments made by anyone for whom he considers to be an enemy.A witless, unsubtle and closing-in-on-useless book.Of course, if what you are interested in is seeing Pinker take a bludgeon to a bunch of strawmen, then you'll probably like this book."
3,Strawmen as Fish in Barrels,"I have enjoyed other books by Pinker and was expecting to enjoy this one as well. However it did not take me very long to tire of this tedious book. Pinker does not hide his opinions. Indeed he is most certain of them and expounds them tediously in page after page of description. With that, I found myself quickly growing tired of him building up strawmen only so that he can knock them down. I am not a scholar but even I could tell that his descriptions of opposing philosophical theories are shallow and designed to prove his point.Mr. Pinker obviously has deep convictions about human nature. This book reminds me of being forced as a student to listen to a professor profess his pet theories before a captive audience. I found no great exploration of ideas here but just a declaration of Pinker's beliefs. I kept thinking of strawmen and fish in barrels while I read this."
4,Prepare to get pissed,"Mr. Skinner likes to show one side of the picture. If you check the facts. He tends to take the statistics that support his points. Oh that is life Lies, Damn Likes, and Statistics. Can't blame him.He does make you rethink my views."
4,Excellent work but.....,"Mr. Pinker provides illuminating, well written insight into how our minds work. In the process he provides compelling arguments to negate the dreams of social engineers to remake society in the image of the ""New Soviet Man"", the Nazi Superman, or, by extension, the ""New Liberal Man"" of the West.Still, one is left with questions. If the human mind were simple enough to comprehend, might we (even Pinker) be too simple to comprehend it? Why are we here? Why do we wonder about such things as human nature and how our minds work?It is there you are deposited, to consider the alternatives."
1,"Highly politicized, non-scientific book","I have been an avid reader of Steven Pinker's books but found this one non-scientific, political garbage. Instead of concentrating on the science, he seems to dedicate his efforts to bashing scientists who don't share his (and his friends) opinions. Highly dissappointing."
3,Realistic Human Nature -- Positives and Negatives,"As a psychology professor, I support the current trend toward making psychology realistic rather than overly optimistic. I don't think we need to be depressed about human life, even though it is often a struggle (of individuality, culture, and biology). Dr. Pinker's long book is informative, yet also quite abstract. A realistic appreciation of individual differences in personality is the key to advancing psychology into the 21st Century. It is also the key to living well."
4,Clear but Written for Inconsequential English Professors,The book is a great exposition of modern scientific thinking and understanding of the nature of man--but it spends some time on topics that are entirely obvious outside of the humanities academia. Indeed Pinker gives them too much respect by honoring them with such a lengthy reply.His other two books are much better.
4,A Disturbing Premise,"Perhaps this book is just a bit behind the coming crest of a wave of open discussion on the nature-nurture dialogue....then again, maybe this is just a sideshow to the debate on the ethos of genetic manipulation. It's hard to tell. From one standpoint Pinker argues that we have failed to adequately address the relationship between the genetics of personality and environmental effects on character development. That sounds like an argument that has needed to be made for quite some time....perhaps this is the coming crest of the wave. Then again, he is persuasive in his argument that we need to begin to focus on a balance between environmental forces and genetic predisposition. This requires hard change from entrenched paradigms that many fear to challenge. I'm not sure there are enough with the commitment to make this happen, but one thing that seems certain is that books like this are at least opening the door to the discourse necessary to make it possible."
5,The truth will prevail,"At age 54, I took an Introduction to Sociology course. The Intro Book was written in 2010/2011 by the famous Professor Henslin. I still scratch my head in disabelief. This intro course disavowed Biology, Psycology, Genetic, Neuro Science. At the time, I had no idea what Sociology was about. In 2012, they are still teaching the Blank Slate, amazing, and the Ghost in the Machine. I did not read the Blank Slate until January 2012. Thank you Professor for rebuking all the absurdities of traditional Sociology. I know they are afraid of losing their jobs but they won't. Marx and Durkheim are their Gods and God is infallible. They still believe the Hunter/Gatherers were peaceful, egalitarians, who protected the Earth. It's amazing.At some point, this Classic Sociology of Marx, Durkheim, et al will disappear like the belief that the Sun revolved around the Earth. Thank you Professor Pinker, Jared Diamond, and Wilson for having the guts to help start this revolution."
4,Scientific dogmatism exposed,"Scientists and academicians, it is often supposed, are dispassionate intellectuals simply following the evidence where it leads--regardless of the scientist's own personal views. Pinker's fascinating study repeatedly demonstrates that scientists, contrary to popular belief, do in fact have heavy ideological axes to grind, and they defend their cherished views with dogmatic, quasi-religious fervor. Of course, any intelligent, educated, open-minded individual who has been following the Darwin vs. Design dialogue already knows this."
5,Impressive; I also recommend...,"I was immensely impressed by this book. It is well argued and well worth reading, although I thought that his treatment of art was ill ventured and shallow.For an equally fascinating contrary view, I would recommend reading Greenspan & Shanker's book ""THe First Idea""."
5,No Mo Po Mo,"No Mo Po Mo = No More Postmodernism.Steven Pinker has joined the ""No Mo Po Mo"" group by writing this book. Good for him!If you want to understand human nature, or (a much lesser goal) -- if you wanna understand a little bit more about human nature, you would do well to read J.R.R. Tolkien.Of course, the PoMo crowd cannot stand Tolkien, and froths at the mouth when he is mentioned. BUT (somehow) the greatest poet of the 20th century (W. H. Auden) loved Tolkien.How it will turn out remains to be seen!HIWATORTBS, all! :-)Jimmy"
2,Wrong order?,"When I ordered this knife I actually got what appears to be a Templar sword instead. This may have just happened to me and been a glitch in the ordering system, but I just thought it should be put on here."
2,Horrifyingly amateur work,"I think that the overall idea Mr. Metzger is attempting to acheive is fascinating, however the way he opts to implement his story is unyielding and grating. First, there are far too many asides in the novel to explain in one sentence some fundamental law of physics. Being a scientist, I found rather irritating, as the summaries were glib, and intended to have a hand waving effect to make the scene plausible. Second, the character development is remarkably bad. Most of the characters have one of three major personality quirks: Domineering, histrionic, or obsessive-compulsive. There is very little (if any) depth given to any of the characters. Third: The plot.....??? I like my science fiction to be more science than fiction, but that's a personal choice. All in all, not worth the time. At all. It gets a two star rating for having an idea I would like to see used in a much better novel."
3,Run-of-the-mill,"Like a previous reviewer commented, I think Metzger's sense of timing and plot development was off the mark. The passage in which filaments shoot out of Alexandria's forehead and download knowledge into the other character's brains left me baffled. I had problems with suspension of disbelief here. What, aliens in the plot already? Where's the suspense?The novel should have centered on humans making scientific discoveries - aliens should not have been introduced until perhaps near the end of the novel, as in Carl Sagan's Contact.Character descriptions are also a little overwrought.Greg Bear's Blood Music is an example of hard sci-fi that works well. Economic use of language that draws you in."
3,Great Story that Spun Out of Control --- Spolier Free Review,"*******SPOILER FREE REVIEW ******I absolutely love the concept and scope of this story. It is somewhat unique and refreshing and I enjoyed the ""what if"" aspect that the author engages in. What if you could go back in time, what if you did this at a critical moment in history?Unfortunately, it felt like the story spiraled out of control and grew to a life of its own. There was an exponential rise in scope and scale that stretched the boundaries of my ability to set aside my disbelief and enjoy the story.I applaud the author's bold vision and ultimately I did enjoy the story so I wasn't disappointed...but at the end, I did feel let down. All the overarching themes didn't quite connect and the net result had me feeling that it was all kinda pointless :("
2,new england patroits ice scraper,"the ice scraper was not what i thought as picture showed. was dirty as if used..labels were not good quality..brush was not smooth, very disappointed."
3,Good work by Tannock GW,"I am a Medical Microbiology Student and I find this book real good for my serminar topics, the articles on Dental Caries was a 'classic'"
3,Like trying to drink from a fire hydrant,"If you want something that covers almost all of Taj's material, this is for you. If you want a taste of Taj Mahal, who I think is fantastic, then this is too much. I used to have ""The Best of Taj Mahal"" but I loaned it out. Surprise, it never got returned. I should've just replaced that one which is more concise and user friendly for putting in the player for a spin. ""Essential"" is a sprawling two discs that varies greatly and serves more as an encyclopedia."
3,disappointed in this,"I am a Taj Mahal fan and love his voice, but this collection did not have songs I enjoyed."
5,Scrape n Pry Bar,"This is a tool that serves a mighty handsome reward when used to pry boards apart or to scrape gummy items off the floor. It took some searching to find it, but is well worth the cost, even at less than $10."
4,It's about time,"The original release of this program, first on cable and VHS and then on DVD, featured an altered audio track in which tracks from the ""Out Of The Blue"" album were dubbed over the live performances. This gave rise to unfair claims that ELO lip-synched their concerts. However, this new remaster restores the live sound as heard at Wembley that night--and proves that the overdubs were unnecessary. Some of the video effects are cheesy by today's standards, and the band does use some pre-recorded effects and string augmentation (NOT vocals or principal instruments), but on the whole, this is a great document of a fine LIVE band at its commercial peak."
3,A bit too psychedelic,"The audio was fine and most of the video is good, but the video producer ruined some songs by getting too cute with his special effects. If you enjoy watching video through a kaleidoscope, then this video is a must see. Otherwise, pay the 9 bucks and enjoy the normal parts, and accept the spinning video as a product of the times."
5,I have heard the Light,And it is good! in fact everyone has heard the light for the first time in 30 years! At long last someone decided to sort out the soundtrack on this! and it sounds great LIVE! even flubbed lines and violins going out of tune just the way it should be! Time to put the Lip-sync brigade to bed!ELO Rocked Live! Now! what about those bloody anoying 'special' effects ugh!I wish someone could find alternative film of the concert and remove these! Why are they there? was a huge laser lit space ship not enough?Buy This and forget the older versions of this concert!
4,Out of the Blue,This item was as described and was is great condition. I would have no problem buying from this dealer again.
4,Been waiting for this one.,This sure beats the heck out of the VHS version. The sound quality is much improved. I rate it as a great buy for any ELO fan.
2,Thank God for technology,"Wow! has video quality improved since the seventies, camera angles andimage quality are poor at best. Only buy this to get your ELO fix."
2,An avid fan says not so good...,"I consider ELO to be one of the greater pop-rock bands of the 70s. I own all of their albums on vinyl, through Time. So take this with a grain of salt...I was disappointed with this dvd primarily because of the obvious overdubs done to the vocals and strings. I would prefer to see a dvd that is an honest ""live"" representation of the band. Rarely will a band's performance be so pristine live, as they are in the studio. We know that when we go to concerts. When I purchase a live concert video, I want and expect it to capture the nuances of a live performance. This dvd seems fake to me. I would only purchase this dvd if you're a diehard ELO fan. It's not worth viewing multiple times."
1,Awful Sound,The original sound quality of this concert is so bad that it would put old ELO fans like myself off ELO - Dont waste your money try another recording ! or the original vinyl!
3,night beat,the quality of the recording is quite bad - seldom for jazz recordingsof 80-s. the piano and sometimes guitar sessions are more or less fine.
4,Some real Jolson Oldies,"Here is a collection of early Jolson favorites from the Victor and Columbia series, with fairly clean transfers to CD. See where these place on the Jolson site... This collection was repressed as the ""Black and White"" CD, by the same publisher."
2,Sorry I bought this CD,"To start out with, the libretto is entirely in Italian with no English translation and I cannot say a whole lot for the synopsis, although it was better than nothing. The worse thing for me was the recording quality. This was recorded in 1955, and it might as well have been recording in the 1930s. Maybe I just expect too much, but it literally spoiled the whole CD for me. Also, I did not care too much for the singing, but as I am not someone who knows a lot about opera singing, and I am not a musician, I cannot really say if there was anything wrong with it or if it was just my personal taste, or if, as more than likely, the recording sound spoiled the sound of the voices. I do not think I am even going to keep my copy of this opera."
2,Too many errors!,"This book would be very helpful and comprehensive if it weren't for so many errors. It's very frustrating to try and learn when parts of a question or answer are wrong (and obviously so). Makes you wonder who, if anyone, double-checked the problems to make sure they worked out correctly."
1,"Errors, errors, errors!!!","I agree with the other reviewer that found multiple, multiple errors in this book. It is terrible for anyone attempting to hone skills, because one must not only figure out the problems but also detect the errors in the problems and their explanations. For example, figures are labeled differently in the problems and in the answers (making comparison of your calculations and theirs doubly difficult) and numbers are different in the problems than those used in calculations for the answers. Although this book contains some useful information, it is rendered useless by the multiple errors. Do NOT bother with this book!!!"
3,So-So,this book will help you review the basics but if you are looking to explore or review the hard tibits of geometry this book will not help out extremely. It contains the basic problems and most of the formulas for geomety but it just isnt challeging enough to review for things like the SAT I and will not give a good foundation for Algebra II.
1,Sheer Insanity,"Santorum is insane. I am 35 years old and I have NEVER, EVER heard and read so many bigotted, hateful statements issued by a politician. He's so radical that he reminds me of Adolf Hitler. He doesn't care about the constitutional separation of church and state and the majority of his agenda focuses on the GLBT community and women - by denying them basic human rights. If elected president of the United States, he will do everything he can to turn this country into a ""Christian"" version of theocracies like Islamic Republic of Iran, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. His allegiance is with the Pope and the Vatican, NOT to the American people."
1,I was expecting it to be a Horror novel...,"At first glance you might mistake Senator Santorum for a charming person. What a mistake that would be! It only takes a comment from Senator Santorum (like comparing a gay couple to a man having sex with a dog) for you to see that this is no charming person. I had to read his book, to see if he could explain how he feels it is OK to lock up two consenting adults for engaging in a sex act that he didn't agree with. He didn't really explain that in the book, so I feel like it was a waste of my time. This was not a good book... It left a lot of unanswered questions."
1,totally not what i was expecting,"i was looking for novelty lubricants. i am sorely disappointed. honestly i think this man needs to change his name, so that people no longer get confused when talking about anal sex. its a really unfortunate stigma, and i dont think improperly performed anal sex, unpleasant though the aftermath may be, has done anything so terrible as to deserve this association."
1,On my must burn list,"What a waste of publisher's money. Who reads such trash as this? I want to read about someone whos contemporary and aware of the changing world he lives in, not of someone who thinks Jesus is coming back tomorrow to take all the good people to heaven and leave the homosexuals and non-submissive women here to burn. I want to read of a man who understands that there are many different types of people but we can all co-exist peacefully.Rick is not that man and his book is not that good..."
1,Could he be any more full of himself?,"Unfortunately, a negative star was not available for rating this book. If you find yourself so bored that this book is actually interesting, you should have your doctor adjust the strength of your medicine. Check it out at your local library, but don't waste your hard earned money on it. Watching paint dry or grass grow is more enjoyable than reading about Rick Santorum."
1,I would give it 5 stars if I suffered from insomnia...,"This had to be one of the dullest books I have ever read. It was given to me by a friend, so thankfully I didn't waste my own money on it. I thought it would be an interesting read, given the publicity Senator Santorum receives for all the ridiculous comments he's become famous for. Don't waste your time with this one... Very boring."
1,Extreme Disappointment,"This scope reminds me of the $40 department store telescope we had when I was a kid. The scope does not focus well enough to see Saturn clearly with either eyepiece and the Barlow simply makes everything worse. After contacting the seller and asking to return the scope, they suggested reading the manual. There is no information in the manual related to adjusting the scope and I expect this thing will just end up in a closet since the seller will not take it back."
4,good beginner scope,"At the price I paid for it on ebay I'm not complaining at all, I bought this scope primarily to observe the moon, and it is perfect for me! I understand what was said about focusing the planets correctly, with a little bit of patience though, you will see Saturn clearly using this scope. I paid 60 ($120) and I'm a total novice, its great for me but if I get into it properly, I will obviously upgrade to something better.My advice; Want to observe the moon in detail but don't want to pay the world for it? Get this scope.Want to observe planets and galaxies? Look elsewhere."
3,Worked for a few hours,This stuff kills the fleas that are on the dogs when you spray them but didn't seem to keep them off like it claims.
4,Not Mainstreem Ska - But they Rock!,"Hot Stove Jimmy deserves a great review. They are a really excellent ska band! If you enjoy the Blue Meanies, you will enjoy Hot Stove Jimmy. If you only like what MTV tells you to like, try Oasis - they seem to be trying like heck to get that guy noticed again."
4,Good Enough,"Yeah I had heard one of their songs on xm radio and decided to get this cd. It isn't that good but if you're like me and have bought all the R.B.F, Bosstones, Caddies, and Kalnoky stuff out there then you should get this. The song are all pretty good (except for the satan disco), escpecially the My Girl cover. If you are just starting out on a ska expedition you should buy something else."
4,Wonderful first book,"Wicked Dreams is the first book from the author Michael Parsons. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and found it interesting from beginning to end. The plot was gripping, with the occasional twist that kept my interest, and the author's descriptions of the characters brought them to life. In Wicked Dreams, the author combines action, believable characters and a strong plot, resulting in a book which keeps your attention. I strongly recommend this book, and look forward to reading more from this talented newcomer."
5,great product,"These are fantastic pantyhose. I used to buy them at a store nearby, but then they stopped carrying them. I was happy to find them on Amazon. They were reasonably priced and came right away. No problems."
1,DONT BUY THESE,$10 is alot to pay for panty hose that run the first time you gently slide your foot in them!!And the color was more like white then gold! AWFUL!! Dont even think about it!! Go to JCPenny instead better hose at a cheaper price!!
3,control top pantyhose,"I have not had the opprotunity to where them, but have had them before. some what dissapointed, same price in store, w/o s/h. Should and will do my homework before next time.fast service with company tho.."
2,"""Average"" is overdoing it","I bought this book thinking it was written from a different angle and would be an interesting, informative read. Factual errors too numerous to count put the entire book in question for me. Burps of the writers opinion presented as facts abound. For a book that is supposed to be a detailed, microscopic look at the White Album there were just too many errors for me to enjoy it. When discussing the Manson Family's infatuation with the album he mistakenly calls Susan Atkins (aka Sadie Mae Glutz) ""Tex Atkins"" mixing her name up with Tex Watson. My advice: Do your homework and hire a proofreader!PS I love Wild Honey Pie. So there!"
2,Biased Author,"Quantik's book is a collection of generally known anecdotes, along with some questionable speculation.Annoyingly he feels duty bound to weigh in repeatedly with his personal opinion in a very unjournalistic way:""The theme of their (Patti H. and Eric C.) unrequited love had already inspired Clapton's only great song, ""Layla"" (While Boyd and Clapton's realized relationship was responsible for the apalling ""Wonderful Tonight.)"" p. 94""Described by its author as a 'little experimental piece,' Wild Honey Pie is no such thing unless the experiment in one involving horrible torture."" p. 86Some of the details are interesting but Quantik's writing style is obnoxious. The book is carried solely by the intrinsically compelling nature of the subject matter."
3,Not Much of a Literary Revolution,"I am a Beatles fan and I pride myself on knowing a lot of extraneous material about the band and the individuals. However, I am by no means an expert. This book is geared to the casual Beatle fan, as it does contain quite a bit of information, but almost all of it is a rehash. There were literally only one or two tidbits of information that I had not heard before.Not a bad read, but not terribly informative. Buy to suit your knowledge level."
1,Waste of time,"One would have a hard time believing that this was author David Quantick's most beloved album, as he spends a good deal of the book making snide and sinister comments regarding the band members songwriting styles and personalities. ""Revolution"" reads like most any Pitchfork Media review; pompous and arrogant. And really, that's all the book is... one painfully long album review. The factual meat of the book is spotty at best and comes from the most commonly recycled Beatles tales.This book will only amuse the most casual of Beatles fans, and even then may border on unreadable with Quantick's snobbish tone. ""I Will"" a throwaway? Come off it."
1,awful,"This is one of the worst books I have read due to the author. He cannot help but throwing his own opinions in all the time. I did not buy this book to find out what he thinks, I wanted to find out more about the White Album. It was mostly opinionated drivel that sounds like a long review rather than a factual account and I will not be buying anything from this bloke again."
1,"The author says this is his favorite album, but bashes half the songs","The author claims that the white album is his favorite album, but when breaking the album down song by song he goes on to bash all the songs at very cursory levels. Overall this book is a really long really bad review of the white album. I couldn't finish it and had to come here to check the other reviews to make sure I wasn't the only person who hated the book."
2,Don't read unless you really like the White Album,"I just discovered recently, but have been listening to it non-stop. So much more that I wanted to find out more about it, other than all the crap on the interent. I found this book in my college's library and thought it was perfect for me. I was bitterly dissappointing. Apart from going through every, yes every, month of 1968, Quantick added little knew material to what I had found on the internet. His ripping of Clapton was uncalled for, to the point where it was rude, especially calling ""Wonderful Tonight"" effectivley a peice of garbage. And if I had to hear the ""Let It Be"" sessions being compared to ""hell"" again, I was going to personally go over to England and strangle Quantick. The writing was so poor, I thought several times throughout the book that I was reading someone's dissertation than an actual published book."
2,A book about Paul,"This book is improperly titled. It should not be called ""The Making of the Beatles' White Album""; instead, it should be called ""A Tribute to Paul McCartney"". Quantick constantly shows his love for Paul McCartney throughout this book. He actually says, ""The world knew Paul McCartney was the greatest songwriter who'd ever lived"", a claim that could be hotly debated. He also calls him ""the band's greatest rocker"", ""the band's greatest balladeer"" and ""the band's greatest singer"". He says that Ringo Starr was ""absent in a huff"" from the recording of ""Back in the USSR""; he claims that George Harrison was the reason that Manson committed his murders; he butchers John Lennon a few times. Yes, he does say he likes Yoko and her work, but mostly he talks about Paul McCartney. Paul himself could have authorized this book, because 95% of the stuff in here about him is glowing."
4,Oldie but goody!,"I recently discovered Ms. Wurts in a fantasy anthology and am always interested in new authors in this category. While this is not a new book it was new to me. It has good and bad sorcerors and features a lot of sailing journeys by the main characters as they travel among the various countries in this imaginary world. One of the ""good guys"" is actually a pirate! (You have to read it to appreciate this.) There are an assortment of supernatural creatures of varying physical aspects, intelligence and psychic abilities. There is the usual journey along which our hero achieves great deeds while learning life lessons from a variety of mentors. This book combines three shorter novels of the trilogy, Cycle of Fire, and could have done with a better quality of production as my used copy, sold as ""very good condition,"" showed considerable wear. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and recommend it to other fans of the ""swords and sorcery"" type of fantasy."
2,"Starts well, but ...","The first book in this trilogy is good - perhaps very good. But it's all downhill from there, sadly. The prose gets more and more involuted; the dialogue migrates from 'wooden' through 'strained' all the way to 'frankly preposterous'; and the descriptions (especially of the 'magic') strain analogies well past breaking point. The final few chapters are a strain to read :-(Conclusion - if you enjoyed Daughter of the Empire et al, read them again and leave this one alone."
1,"Bad plot, worse writing","I don't understand the other reviewers. This book was painfully bad. The plot is slow, the characterization is abysmal (they're poorly motivated and at the same time ridiculously, nonsensically complex), and finally the writing was so bad I had to put the book DOWN--something I rarely do. It sounds like it was written by an adolescent depressive: baggy sentences, fuzzy ideas, and poor, inappropriate metaphors. If you thrive on the sharp writing of (early) Robert Jordan or Tolkein, or even MZ Bradley, STEER CLEAR OF THIS WASTE OF TIME."
1,Disappointed in coverage,"This book contains brief (less than one page average) biographies of 396 people. Not one of them was a pioneer documented in the 1895 Yukon Order of Pioneers, 40 Mile photograph. Not one of them was in the photograph of Yukon River traders taken about 1885 at St. Michael.The sources cited are mostly Alaska newspapers and magazines, and mainly obituaries or biographical puff pieces. References to the original articles are cited, but there is no indication of whether or how much the author has edited them.The book has no index or table of contents.This review applies to ISBN0788400878. The copy I looked at was published in 1984. There are other editions of the same title out there, one labeled ""Volume 5"". The publishers web site also lists Vol 2 and Vol 4, but they are not available. It's not clear if these volumes include new names.If you expect to find your pioneer in these books, you are liable to be disappointed."
5,Impressed,I love Citre shine products. I have tried several leave-in glossing products by Citre and this one is my favorite. It leaves my waist-long hair tangle-free and gives it a wicked shine.
5,Best Anti-frizz,Best anti-frizz serum out there. They did sell this is our local stores but no longer. Thanks to Amazon I can still buy it.
4,"Works well, if used sparingly.","I was a big fan of Citre Shine in high school, but I haven't been able to find this laminating serum in stores for about four years. However, after years of searching, I suddenly found it on the shelf at Wal-Mart one day a couple of months ago, and I began using it again. In my opinion, the formula is quite different from the serum that I used from 2005-2007. Though it still performs well, creating extremely shiny hair that always prompts my friends to ask me what I did differently,the consistancy is a lot more sticky. I have medium-thick hair, and anything bigger than a dime-sized amount of the serum turn my hair into a heavy, sticky mess. I thought that it might have just been the bottle that I purchased, but my second bottle did the same thing. I recommend using only about half a pump of this product, or else your hair will look oily. But used sparingly, this provides AMAZING results."
5,Perfect Shine,"I love this stuff! I've tried so many products and found Citre Shine to give me the best shine for my curly, dry hair. It's not expensive and makes my hair look wonderful!!!!"
5,Excellent,"this is an excellent book! It makes seemingly hard textures, forms and shapes, simple. It shows the colors and mediums you use. It makes it all so simple! I highly recomend this book for the watercolor landscape artist!"
1,This book reeks of gasoline,"Getting this book took a bit longer than I thought it would. I thought it would arrive by Wed., not Saturday.I expected the book to show up at my house it a like-new condition.It did look ok. As I was leafing through it I soon became aware of a nasty smell. I began to sniff it and came away with the conclusion that this book had been exposed to some gasoline. I had saved the package and soon found that their was a strong smell in the empty sack and none on the outside. Please understand: I am not saying I had a CSI machine to scientifically examine this book. I just used my nose. It was a subjective examination.I can tell you that I think this book will be good for my purposes, once I figure out how to de-smell it. (Does anyone have a suggestion?) The book would be a good addition to an artists library.I won't buy anything through this seller in the future."
1,horrible edition,"I know the book, and i love the story, BUT the big problem is this edition of the book. It looks like being a 5th photocopy, picture quality is terrible, binding is cheap, some words are almost unreadable. For a price of $32 I'm very disappointed with this book, stay away from this edition!"
1,This is a disappointment,"If you are expecting to hear BOB MARLEY singing, you'll be in for a disappointment. This is somebody else sing Bob, don't buy it...my advice, get the real thing! Cheap t'ings doan good!"
4,Birnbaum Review,"This is a great book for first time Disney visitors or returning guests (like myself!). I haven't been to Disney in a few years so I bought the book to read up on the new attractions and enjoyed the many tips that the book provided. It outlines trips for singles, adults and children."
5,I Love Disney,"I have been buying Birnbaum's Walt Disney World for 12 years even though we only go to Disney World every 2-4 years. For months before we go, I highlight everything we want to see and do in Disney. It's also great to go back to my old books to see how much has changed.It's the best book for anyone interested in going to Disney World. I highly recommend (and have many times)."
1,More Disney Hype,"Birnbaum seems to work as an agent for Disney, giving you fluff and hype for your money. This book seems to be little more than a brief encapsulation of the Disney World resort and park attractions, without the critical information, the good as well as the not so good, you really need in order to make intelligent choices about how and where you're going to spend your money on your next Disney vacation. Pretty pictures, though. A better choice for your money would be the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World by Bob Sehlinger."
2,No substance,"It was like reading a Disney brochure- no real info. There were tidbits about each park, but nothing that would help us out. The Unofficial Guide to Disney World was much, much, much better."
4,Nice tool for Disney,"This was a great book to help plan our disney vacation. Unless you are going for 2 weeks you really need to map out your days and this book was a great guide to show what was good for toddlers, teens, couples, etc."
5,Good Company,"I bought this shirt and it looks really kool. It didn't cost a lot, and the shipping came pretty fast. I just really like my shirt :oD"
4,Could Be Better,"This is a very well made, appealing toy, with two minor irritants. There is no cover for the tray the pieces come in and it is very difficult to reposition them the way they came so that they all lie flat."
4,Addition to Train Set,"This is a fun addition to our train set, however we were disappointed that some of the pieces only had pictures on one side."
4,Just what I expected!,"I purchased the 53 piece wooden town for my grandchildren to have as a quiet activity when they visit. The 2 year olds played with the houses; the 3 yr olds built a community, and the dads built the entire town once the kids went down for their naps!!! I expected and recieved a creative, high quality, colorful toy! Well pleased with all Melissa and Doug products."
2,Pure Joy? Yeah Right!,"I wouldn't recommend this book. Written by a now-married man, it doesn't really speak to singles who will be single well belong his marrying age of 30 - and possibly for life.I'd rather recommend the works of Julia Duin on singleness and abstinence... As a woman who remained unmarried and a virgin and is now her fifties, she is better equipped to speak with integrity and sincerity about how HARD abstinence really is. No sugar-coating needed, we're grownups now!Julia's take on this book: ""Believe me: The only positive side to single sexuality is not getting AIDS. The only singles I know who consider their state to be ""pure joy"" are those who have been through a divorce."""
2,not that great,While the designs look great the book leave a lot to be desired. The techniques are not really simple and assume you have a basic knowledge of metal smithing and are able to solder.
2,Gilbert Gil Gets Squished,"This is a recent, licensed version of Gil's ""Acústico"" album which first appeared in 2001. It's a great show, but whoever mastered this DVD took the original footage and inexplicably transformed it from its full screen format (4:3) into a widescreen format (16:9). Bad decision. The result is that Gilberto Gil and everyone else in the film appear ""squished"" during the entire 100-minute program. Unless you wear special glasses, my suggestion is that you try to locate the original Acústico album if possible."
4,Works as good as I expected,Really the fact that it works at all should make this product worth it. It works better than our original battery in our DSC-T7. Might not stay charged as long as an 'Official Sony Product' but the price makes it worth it.
5,ASVAB Bilingual Edition,"I would recommend this book for anyone who primarily speaks Spanish, but wants to ace the ASVAB test for the Air Force, which is in English."
5,Dark and Complex,"The Darkening Sea reads as if it were written in the 1920's or '30s. Woodman really makes the reader feel the transition between the Victorian and modern ages. The characters are very multidimensional and complex. The main character in particular is very well done - you understand and feel for him even if he is hard to like.The book has a much more 'literary' feel than Woodman's Drinkwater series. It's more Hemmingway than Patrick O'Brian.The nautical aspects as well as the historical/geographic settings are very well done.A thoroughly enjoyable deep summer read. If you have been frustrated (as I have) by not being able to obtain some of the Drinkwater books (I have to read them in order of course!), the Darkening Sea will be a thoughtful diversion - a taste of Woodman's 'haute cusine' as it were.Highly recommended!"
5,Get in the mood with Spode!,"I have had my Spode Christmas Tree china for about 15-20 years and I love it! In early November I replace our ""every day"" china with the Spode and we use it as late as the end of January. It signifies a wonderful time of year and gets us thinking about the Christmas season. I can set a simple table or one with fine linens and candles and Christmas Tree does well in both venues. I have found it to be attractive, durable, and enjoyable. This china goes through the dishwasher well and may be used in the micowave, also. So make some wassail or hot chocolate, whip up a delicious meal - plain or fancy- and enjoy Spode Christmas Tree china with friends and family!"
4,"Good, low-calorie dessert","This pudding is very easy to make - done in about 5 minutes. The texture is not as good as a cooked pudding, but it's acceptable. The chocolate flavor is very good, better than the regular chocolate flavor. The combination of low calories and simple preparation makes it a winner in my book."
5,Excellent and guilt-free alternative,"Everybody gets a sweet tooth once in a while, right? As a person who eats healthy most of the time, this is an a good way to to spoil myself without feeling guilty about it. Tastes just as good as its original counterpart."
4,The Same,"As boring as Pudding sometimes sound when suggested for dessert it is still as creamy and chocolaty as it always been. The Same taste but never the less makes a good snack or dessert. Sugar Free is an added plus so Jell-O get 4 Stars, if only for its long tradition of being served at all different kinds of tables."
3,Where are the poles???,I specifically looked for a net that had poles. This is one of the few that had pictures of net and poles. There was no disclaimer stating that poles were not included. For $45 I expected poles. But guess what - no poles! Not too big of a deal but I probably would have bought a cheaper net if I knew poles did not come included with this net. Net looks durable - very heavy for badmitton. Closer to a volleyball net.
5,Great Net!,"I purchased this net 3 years ago, and it's left outside on our badminton court from spring till mid fall. It's held up very well over the years. A great net for all who play serious badminton. FIVE STARS."
5,LOVED THE SERIES!,"Despite being one of the many many fiction works about vampires and werewolves these days, ""Being Human"" has the ability not to become just another one. It stands out because it has heart. The supernatural factors are just that, factors, with the core of the series being finding yourself, fitting in, overcoming obstacles. It's funny, charming, has the right amount of drama, and suspense. And you got to give it to the brits: they are not afraid to be graphic, which in this case is quite refreshing. Definitely a great series. Loved it!"
2,Not a big fan of the original,"I know this is the original series of being human and the US one is based off of this one but I find it to not have that much comedy or drama and definitely not a lot of darkness to it which one would normally expect from something involving a werewolf, vampire, and ghost as antagonists."
5,Great Stuff,"Being Human is a fun show, something different. BTW...it's coming the SyFy in the US very soon."
5,Awesome,It is a good show from across the pond! I thoroughly enjoyed watching this season. I will start watching more shows from across the pond now!
5,Love,Cute men love to watch the actors work their magic.. Getting to be one of my favorite show too good for words
5,worth the wait,"i purchased this item after i started watching the american version on the syfy channel and although i haven't watched it yet, i know it is going to be GREAT!!!"
3,Red Devil #3223 Window Scraper,"I had looked everywhere locally for one of these window scrapers. I had 2 and over the years, one rusted and finally had to be thrown away. I was pleased with the promptness of the delivery. I bought five of them. One was so flimsy and loosely constructed that it wouldn't hold the razor blade; I attempted to bend the holder so it would grip the razor blade but that didn't work. They are rivited together so you can't take them apart and manually adjust them so they will work like the originals I bought many years ago. Sadly, this is a reflection of the deterioration of the quality of manufactured goods sold in the USA. It cost more to return it that to buy it so it has been deposited in the local land fill with other junk. I wish we still made our own products."
5,Perfect for our toddler AND six year old,"We bought these for our 2 year old because he loves cars, trucks, etc and signs! These are so sturdy, and the colors are great! His older brother wants a set of his own now!"
5,Great quality and so much fun!!,My 20 month old son loves these!! They are fun to add to his play rug with houses and streets. Very sturdy wood and great quality!!
5,Fun Toy About Safety,"I bought this toy to help teach about safety and emergency vehicles. I use them with the large block collection we already have and it is a wonderful addition. The street signs are placed to help learn about street safety. It also comes with a great variety of safety and fun vehicles. It is great to watch children play with. One second the fire truck is putting out the fire and the next second, they are giving out ice-cream. This is a great investment."
5,Hours of fun,This had kept my grand daughters amused for hours..Very good valueGoes great with M & D wooden village blocks
4,Wooden signs,the pieces are a little smaller then I thought they would be but the colors and design are good. They will go well with the trains etc.
4,Another great Melissa and Doug product,"This was a Christmas present for my son. I purchased a play rug w/ roads and buildings on it, to go w/ the vehicles and signs. My son has loved every Melissa and Doug toy he's ever received - their products are top notch! Very high quality, wooden vehicles are much more durable than the majority of plastic ones on the market. Bright colors are always a hit, too! My son is 3-1/2, so we're able to teach him what the various road signs mean, too, so there's even some educational value to the toy. I've given away a lot of my son's toys as he's outgrown them, but I will hang onto to the Melissa and Doug toys - either for a second child, at some point, or even for future grandchildren, to pass down. Very few toys, these days, would last that long. But I know these will!"
5,Vehicles and Traffic Signs,"I especially love the traffic signs, helps to show the children these signs, and reinforces the concepts for real life situations. We use these on a play mat of a town. I can even imagine taping a note to some of them for other things...like a ""Stop, don't eat this cake"" sign so my family does not eat something intended for another event!!Great toys."
5,best grandson birthday gift ever!,"Purchased this awhile ago; mailed to my grandson in Canada for his birthday..Feb. 14. When I called that am, he was so busy playing with his trucks, he couldn't be distracted. Really likes them. He has other Melissa & Doug toys; knew I was sending a reliable product - didn't disappoint."
4,Cute Concept,"I was so relieved to find this toy. I had bought my nephew a ""neighborhood streets"" quilt and these toys are perfect for it. He can set up the street signs and the cars are little and skinny enough to fit perfectly on the quilt. The only educational part I see is my nephew learning different street signs and different emergency vehicles since they are drawn true to likeness. If a child has a good imagination, this toy will be played with for a very long time."
2,Byrd Cara Cara Knife - not too good for me,"I've owned many Spyderco knives before. I did not really like this one. I don't know if the making in China has to anything to do with it. I took a gamble on this one and it really didn't pay off. I would recoment the Spyderco knifes to any one out there, except this model."
4,Unrecognized Gem!.,"Simon Says, a prog act from Sweden does a really nice job on this album(their 2nd i beleive),stepping into the prog arena with some great music.Some nice long songs full of everything,lots of old school style and influences with a modern touch added,The singer takes some getting used to but at least it is somewhat different and not high pitched.Great musicianship,great sounds and overall mmod and feel.This is some great prog music from another great Swedish band.You wll hear lots of great keys of all sounds,excellent guitar,sitar,solid bass and bass pedals etc.The title song Pardadise Square kicks it.The short instrumental,Fly in a Bottle is really nice.Followed by the epic White Glove and ending with Aftermath.This album paved the way for Simon Says following album Tardigrade! A solid 4 star album!An unrecognized gem."
4,fine memoir style and subject matter: hippie communes,"Micah Perks' strategy is to write a present tense memory narrative of her youth in Vermont where she witnesses the folly of hippy commune living and her father's tyrannical moral relativism, which he uses to justify a rather Billy Goat existence, at the expense of his wife. Perks never preaches, analyzes, or tells us much. Instead, she narrates strings and strings of memories. The only problem with this approach is that there is not much dramatic tension, no roller coaster ride, but a sort of flat line throughout the 160-page book. However, her style and language are sharp and immaculate."
1,not good,i ordered this part because all the auto stores have it as being the right part number for what i needed but it ended up being just a little to small and would fit
4,Great Pick-Up For The Ska-Punk Fan,"This is a solid album with most of the songs being more of the mellow variety, than the in your face ska-punk of a band such as Operation Ivy. They do have a few high energy songs, including my favorite Telegraph song Head First, Feet First. Also hidden in the bonus tracks there in a nice cover of Operation Ivy's Unity, as well as a bunch of jokes and gags."
3,MERRILL REAM 10-LESSON SPEED READING COURSE,"COURSE IS LONG, HARD. WILL TAKE LONGER THAN I THOUGHT.COURSE IS GOOD, EASIER THAN OTHER BOOKS THAT I PURCHASED."
3,Review of Merrill ream speed reading book,A very interesting book. Not sure why I had to pay a high price for a book that was published in the seventies...Very excellent service...
1,Awful!,"Just tried this sauce and simply put it's terrible. How can anyone even call this a Hot Sauce? The garlic flavor is bland and watered down, there is virtually no spice, and the consistency is cream-like. I just put my full bottle in the garbage. Save your $$$."
4,MAYHEM!,"This dvd is pretty cool, although there are a lot of boring parts to it. Sometimes i find Maniac's vocals to be very annoying, but the great musicians backing him up, make up for it. Hellhammer is amazing on the drums... He makes it look so easy. I thought the pig's head on stage was cool, and the barbed wire. Pretty good set list to...This is not the Mayhem of old, but it is just as good. This right here, is true, raw black metal.If you are some metal poser, who just wants to buy this to try and be hardcore in some way, just because of the Infamous stories that surround the band... Then don't get it, because you are a moron. BUT... if you love black metal (real black metal) you will probably enjoy this."
4,Not too bad...,"I expected alot from this DVD and wasn't disappointed. This line-up is much better then the 2010-11 version, Maniac is a much better vocalist. Like others, I did expect more of a visual performance which wasn't too exciting but the vocals and music made up for it."
2,Boring annoying ear ache of a DVD,"This band is not fun to watch, and not fun to listen to. I have to be fair and say I was not a fan prior to buying the DVD, however I like a wide range of black metal bands like Cradle of filth, Dimmu Borgir, Emperor, old mans child.Everyone mentions how good the sound is, I didn't think so. The music is over the singer, the singer has a harsh foreign accent, and the singer screams like a girl. You combined all these elments together and what your left with is an indecipherable mess. The musicians also make no effort to move around, the singer is boring. The quality is ok, but its very bootleg and not up to current DVD standards. I am giving it an extra star for production, because I have seen much worse DVD's coming from underground bands (ex: bad luck 13) with much worse picture and sound. This is a very average DVD. Hohum...good thing I found a way to get a good trade in on it."
2,Child did lost interest after 3 min,Totally lost interest. Someone got this for our daughter and she just doesn't care about it. It just takes up space. It does the ABC's however there are so many other toys out there that are more fun than this one.
3,Ehhhh,"This was a gift for my son. He enjoys pushing the buttons and watching Toby move and talk. However, my son would talk to Toby and wait for a response and Toby may say one or two more letters or numbers. My son will sit and stare at Toby until it says ""Bye-Bye"", in which my son will then reply ""Bye-Bye"" and wave his hand. As for myself, I was under the impression that Toby was going to be more interactive. For instance when you talk, it continues with its numbers, letters, shapes, or songs, instead constantly pushing the button. At least that was how I had viewed the TV commercials for Toby. Overall his durability seems to be great, as it was able to withstand hugs and drops from my son. Regardless of the lack of interactiveness, my son enjoys playing with Toby and that's all that really matters."
1,My son is afraid of this toy.,"My son is 8 months old, and he is frightened by Toby the Totbot. We put some fresh batteries into Toby, and set him up in front of our son. We were looking forward to the educational value of a talking robot! I pushed one of the buttons and Toby started talking and moving around. My son turns to me with a frightened, ""get me out of here"" look and reaches up his arms for me. I pick him up. Toby is still talking. My son looks back at him, and then quickly turns around and holds onto me even tighter. My wife turns him off. We are done with robots."
3,Why does fisher price insist on using painted toys from China?,"This was given to my daughter, and like so many toys, it is painted and from China.I am looking for lab testing done on this toy specifically regarding the plastic type and paint for safety, as that should be a primary rating factor. Fisher price has a history of problems in this area, like everyone who makes their toys in China."
3,Skip Toby and go for Kasey.,"Toby is cute but I wished I would have waited a year and just went for Kasey the Kinderbot. Toby is very basic in his teaching. My 2 year old didn't learn anything new from Toby except the 3 songs. Toby only teaches numbers 1-10. When the ABC button is pressed, Toby will say a letter and display it. If you don't keep pressing the button, he says 2 more letters and then will say ""bye-bye"". I wish when you pressed the button that Toby would go through the whole alphabet without having to keep pushing the button over and over again. It's like that with the numbers and shapes too. My toddler's Toby happened to break something inside the head. I can hear it rattle around inside. I'm not quite sure what happened to it. Toby still moves, but he doesn't have full motion in his head anymore- just partial. I just wish I would have waited a year and went for Kasey who has so much more to offer."
3,Caterpillar Century,Great book if you are interested in Caterpillar history and the evolution of the machinesThe Caterpillar Century
4,CAT- a picture history,Book contains good photography of most CAT equipment up to the year 2000.Repetitive shots of the same equipment unnecessary.Orlemann's book should be regarded more as a pictorial history of Caterpillar than a detailed written record of the company.Book well bound and of very good quality.
5,great tunes!,"Found this CD in a binder I hadn't seen since high school and can't believe how well this music has aged. A lot of the ska I listened to back in the late 90s sounds awful now, but the Parka Kings are still great--Jefferson Assembly and Pablo Can't Take it are my faves and there are few duds, but overall this is a 5-star ska cd.And, of course, the two tone beat theme song will always bring me back to the (sadly defunct) program on MSU Impact radio."
3,Good Art / Dark Vibe,"I was rather excited about this book when I read the editorial reviews. But after studying it carefully a couple of times, it's now at the bottom of my stack of design books. It's not that the designs aren't good. They're very good, some are excellent. It's just so extremely dark and Euro with a ""slasher"" edge. If you're looking for images that warm your heart and make you feel good about the world, you won't find them in this book. I would have liked more warmth, more color and just a tad more hope. Thumbing through this book always leaves me feeling as though I've just walked through a graveyard on a cold, dark night. If you enjoy that sort of thing, (and who's to say you shouldn't?) then you might enjoy this book."
2,A very LONG reminiscence detracts from this book,I love cozies and am very fond of the Miss Julia series. I had to lower my rating of this book because there is a 98 page reminiscence in the middle of it that provides nothing new to the loyal reader of this series. That's about 1/3 of the book. Very disappointing.
5,Back to her roots!,"Just when I thought the Miss Julia tale had run out of steam, Ann B. Moss rears up and writes one that has the enthusiasm and humor of the first books in the series. Don't miss this one...I hear she has another coming!"
2,formulaic and unsatisfying,"I have enjoyed the Miss Julia books tremendously but this is my least favorite.Miss Julia is married to Sam Murdoch. Poor guy is sent to find the missing Hazel Marie in one part and is gone for a good deal of the story. Miss Julia does not even make a case of those missing hours! It is as if the author could really care less.There are so many little plots that you feel as if the author had several ideas and just took one and expanded it but left the others to show all the complications in this woman's life. There are times when Miss Julia seems to self-centered and the tongue in cheek mood of the other books in this series is really not present here. I found her less likable and also less believable. She has taken in her husband's mistress ad illegitimate child. Now, there is a question about the child's paternity and she is tolerating the whole thing!!!!!Perhaps other books in the series would be a better intro for the uninitiated."
5,Sea Turtles,"I ordered the Ty Island Turtle to put in our beach rentals for the new clients with children checking in. Not only are they a hit with the kids, the parents like them too. The little turtle's name is Sunrise. Perfect as a welcome gift when you are located on the beautiful beach of Siesta Key. The little story on the tag fits perfectly as well."
4,A hard to put down book with a character you come to love&#65533;,"Lindsey knows something of survival, loss, and ""moving on"". Hiding from hostile Indians, as her parents are massacred, caring and protecting her siblings across the prairie, and even the loss of her beloved husband. This is a poignant story of a woman's loss, told with rich descriptive text. One can feel her anguish and fear, her courage and faith. An inspirational read, enjoyable, and attention holding."
3,"Ho, Hum. Ho, Hum","If you've read J R Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood books, you've seen her do this sort of thing before--and much better! If, however, you haven't read many romances, this is an excellent one. I read this last night and it certainly kept my interest, but Ward can write this kind of book in her sleep. It's like eating a candy bar, satisfying while you do it, but an empty experience. It's pretty much a generic (but fun) romance of a wealthy, upper class woman who is in danger and guarded by the working class man with poverty and abuse in his background, making him unwilling to love. Ho, hum. Ho, hum. Seen this a million times before."
4,An sexual tension filled suspense with opposites' attraction,"An Unforgettable Lady, is an engrossing novel of societies golden daughter juggling her father's foundation, disastrous marriage, and being on a killer's target list. Once, Grace Hall first captures the glimpse of John Smith the raw attraction is set for each other at a event when the killer takes his first victim. John is surprised at his attraction to this society aristocrat and almost turns down the job as bodyguard but he is ever the professional and lives with Grace in her house while trying to help the police with leads on the killer.

3,It was good - 3.5 though if I could,"People comparing this to BDB don't understand marketing. BDB was a MASSIVE success so publishers are re-releasing JR Wards' earlier work (released under Jessica Bird) because there is $$ in it for them. Don't expect BDB, she was writing for HARLEQUIN = much much tamer. But it's all good. The author's way of stringing together words and sentences into a flow of something you cannot set aside, exists here. My fav Jessica Bird is Billionaire Next Door...but this is a close second. Except that the heroine is married to another guy. Who was not nice, but not evil either. So where I would have given it 4 stars, but because of the cheating, I deducted a star.But I do recommend buying all the Jessica Bird novels you can at the <$5 price! They are awesome!"
5,Unforgettable Book!,"This was a great read and I reccomend this book to all J.R. Ward fans. The sex scenes are nothing like in the Black Dagger Brotherhood books, but it's still a great story."
2,A BIT OF A LETDOWN,"I'm a HUGE fan of the author and have purchased every one of the Black Dagger Brotherhood series that I can't put down but this one seemed be a little anticlimatic! in her series mentioned, she made you feel for the charactors, most of whom are flawed and not at all what you'd expect. Yet someone finds and gives them love unconditionally and the the story thread is totally engrossing. In this book, it's hard to feel sorry for the heroine who has not only unflawed, remarkable beauty, but a fabulous fortune to go with it. So her marriage is kaput! Snap out of it and join the club. She's weak willed and at 30 still can't stand up to her snot of a mother! The incredibly handsome body guard would have fit in well with the brotherhood. Just needed a little love. It took the path of so many contemporary penny dreadfuls - stick to the brotherhood, this one left me wanting to slap the heroine aand tell her to ""grow a pair!""i'm"
3,Predictable,"Grace is a socialite in new york featured in a magazine for top successful women or something like that. When women from that article get killed Grace hires a bodyguard to keep her safe. John is the owner of a security firm and is highly recommended. John is an alpha.. my way or the highway mentality. Grace is a kind hearted smart business runner who enchants everyone around her, including John. Grace wants John to be with her, to stay. John doesn't know what he wants, he is so use to living as a ghost anything else scares him. They fight their attraction to each other killed all the while keeping safe from the murderer.This was a romantic suspense, to me it wasn't all that suspenseful. I knew who the killer was from the very beginning. To me it was obvious, don't know if it was like that to others. It was a good plot, an ok story delivery, but not one i'd ever read again and I wish I would have gone to the library instead of buying it."
4,A bit of a retroactive re-hash,"Having re-released her original contemporary romances, it was nice to go back and read JR Ward's beginning. The story of socialite Grace and her body guard, rough fmr. military assassin ""John Smith"" has all the hallmarks of ""opposites attract"". But if you're reading the Crave series, you recognize a lot of Isaac in John and their stories of love's hurdles are very much the same. The only difference being the mystery at the core of Lady...who's killing the socialites and why. She gives you two suspects fairly clearly so you won't be guessing who for long. And if you're paying attention, you'll figure out the murderer and the why of it all long before it's over. Not nearly as hot as the BDB series and less raunchy than the Crave series. It's romance on par with traditional contemporary romances."
4,Good Read,Its the first time I am reading this author. Despite being exhausted I read in 2 nights sneaking in reads at lunch and while driving to & from work! I quite enjoyed it. Will read more of her stuff if its like this book.
3,Not as good as her other work,It just wasn't as good as her other books I could and did put it down a couple of times and that just isn't my standard MO for a Jessica Bird/JR Ward book.
4,If you have a passion for learning about disaster....,"I purchased this book for a child, at his insistence that it was the book he ""must have."" I certainly had my doubts. It doesn't seem to be directed at a younger audience.However, this advanced reader devoured Agents of Chaos: Earthquakes, Valcanoes, and Other Natural Disasters. It does not seem to be something he's been drawn to over and over again, but it certainly gave him the information that he wanted, and it did contain enough in the way of illustrations to keep him reading."
2,Too old and too little,"The product works as advertised; and the smell is not strong, which is an added bonus. The problem is with the package I was delivered. First off it seems like they have some pretty old stock. The box was wrapped in a plastic bag and some of the bath salts had leaked out of the package into the bag, resulting in a mess when I finally got the plastic off. On top of that, when I finally opened the box, only it was only half full. I know that the salts ""settle down"" but half is a bit too much.Basically good product, disappointing storage and packaging"
4,Heard it first in German,"A few years ago a German relative sent me an audio tape of ""Der Kleine Koenig Dezember"". I enjoyed it immensely and wished I could share the story with my nieces and nephews. I did search for an English version at that time and was disappointed.This year somehow I came across an English translation of the story on the Amazon website quite by accident and quickly ordered six copies. The translation does not quite do justice to the original and is somewhat abbreviated, but the spirit of the tale is there and will be enjoyed by children and adults alike."
1,Worthless if used daily.,"I bought this as a cheap replacement to the old chair I had for two years that got torn apart. After two weeks the right arm has broken off, and the back support is only days from giving in. I knew it was a cheap chair, but I expected it to last at least 6 months. Also the color is not the same as the picture. Don't make the same mistake I made, spend the extra money and get a decent chair."
1,Dont buy this,"I agree that it makes your voice sound awful when you record a message (adds alot of bass and lowers pitch) but not only that mine broke within a week. Its stuck on 8 messages and pressing any button failed, unplugging it failed. They only offered me to mail it back to them and pay my own shipping for them to look at it."
