5,Fun Story,this book-on-tape is a wonderful way to spend some time escaping into an interesting and exciting story...Domenick Allen's narration is magical. He provides a multitude of characters that bring the words to life for the listener.
2,not the best Newbery winner,I am on a mission to read all the Newbery Medal and Honor winners and The Dark Frigate was the 1924 Newbery Medal winner. This book was hands down the worst book I have ever read. The style of writing made the story so boring and drawn out and half the time I didn't know what was going on. Before I was finished I ended up skimming the pages so I could finish it. Of the 150 or so Newbery winners I have read this one was not so good.
3,Fantastic Resource for Business Owners..,"We have been using this book to promote our new window treatment web site,www.HomeDecInASec.com and have already secured placements in major newspapers across the country. The chapters are well organized and enjoyable to read - the book is full of examples to help you develop successful press releases and pitch letters. This is an invaluable resource if you're looking to promote your business."
1,SECRETS OR A CON JOB,"Unlock all the secrets for a better life with this book only $300US, seems he forgot to put the secrets in though, so , second offer, only $150US, oh no the secrets wern't in there either, so a third book, and the list goes on. Now up to number six and still have not found the secrets. CON! CON! CON! dO NOT GET SUCKED IN TO THE WEB."
5,A must have for fans and for newcomers to this series,"I have been playing Megaman since I was 3 years old but when I picked up Megaman X when it first came out in 1993 it totally blew my mind. The improved graphics, dashing, wall jump, and of course ZERO! When I first heard this X collection came out I got it immediately. It really brought back a lot of memories and I played this non stop and completed it in a week or so. My little cousin grew up during the Playstation 2 age so when it comes to getting a Snes and the actual Megaman X cartridge it can be troublesome and pricey. Why spend so much time and money when you can get it here for under $10? I would definitely recommend this to any Megaman fan or someone who is interested in Megaman!"
4,"Pretty awesome, didn't have any scratches on it, either.","The only downfall I'd have to say is, my PS2 wouldn't read the disk once. But, I'm assuming that's just my PS2, since its a slim and games made before it I hear don't always work entirely on the ps2 slim, but hey, other than that, I'd have to say no other issues with this."
4,great game,This game is great but sadly I had to buy it from someone else because the cd did not work and forgot to return it.
4,all the megamanx you'd want with a lil megaman you could take or leave,"If you're reading this I expect you've played the games and want em all, but dunno if this is worth it, well it is. This game comes with 1-6, cheats able to be used for each, secrets intact (hadouken anyone?) and even a racing game based off the original megaman, for those who'd like a little of the old, though the racing isn't anything to cheer about, it's still fun, but only accessable through beating the games. Just wouldn't call the racing megaman game a reward as much as just a fun game to go along with it as I said, take or leave, but megamanx collection has it all, intact, and even a little extra. It's a collection as you'd expect, though unlocking the art is the real reward for beating them."
5,Megan man x collection game,game came brand new as said. works great. came fast. would recommend to others. great game for price as well.
4,Megaman X Collection Rocks!!!,the overall game play was very close to the old cartridge versions. the save function was a good replacement for the passwords and makes less hassel than having to write them down. the main thing that caused me distress was that the music on MMX3 had been rewritten and lost part of its old feeling. but all other games are the same. i havnt unlocked everything yet but when i do i will post again.
5,Great Game!,"this is a great buy i had bought this game before i think used for about $20 and sold it. i regret selling it. but it doesnt matter cause i bought it here from amazon for $9.99 thats a great price for 6 games... 7 actually cause it comes with a bonus megaman racing game. this game is great. megaman x 5 brings great nastalgic (i think thats how you spell it) value to me. i had recieved megaman x 5 for christmas when i was younger and i loved it so now i bought this and it comes with 6 megaman x games. great price, great value, great game!"
3,a good start for takeshi but those final 20 minutes...,"the last 20 mins or so of VIOLENT COP is really not for the squeamish. it's bleak and very disturbing especially what happens to poor kitano's sister in the movie. but before that, it's a fine cop thriller and it's darkly hilarious. one of the wackiest car/foot chases ever filmed along w/ a jazz score! the folks in hollywood wouldn't think of that. kitano has done much better later w/ SONATINE & FIREWORKS."
4,Violent Cop,"Beat Takeshi stars as a cop named Azuma who goes about his job in a very violent way. When a fellow cop is killed, Azuma looks to settle things himself.Like a lot of Japanese movies, the story moves kind of slow. It's always deadly serious and sometimes people will just stare eachother down for a minute or two. But if you look away for a second, somebody will be getting beaten down and there may be need to rewind. While the the movie has a slow pace, I didn't find it boring one bit. I really like Beat Takeshi's style and I will have to seek out more movies from him. He is a bad dude.I was thinking about giving this just 3 stars, but Beat Takeshi is too cool.3.5/5The DVD from Fox Lorber Films has slghtly above average picture quality."
2,disappointing,"i thought this would be a book about stars! (not surprisingly, given the title). it's actually a book about constellations. it talks about seeing pictures in stars and lists a few common constellations and when to look for them. it has pretty much no information on stars themselves. i wasn't surprised that my daughter wasn't particularly interested. why not have a book about stars---red dwarves, blue giants, black holes, galaxies, etc instead!? argh! wasted opportunity."
3,Blah,"This is an uninspired book. There were a few very interesting pages that the author seemed to spend some actual time on. Beyond that, naming the constellations does not make for very engaging kids reading. There are better choices for young astronomers."
4,You're a Fenderson.,"This is either one helluva pun or it's some divine knowledge or something... I laughed, cried, and hit myself in the eye. Taking a stand back from the hype: this book isn't a joke. It can lead to some very confronting issues such as: the ambiguity of belief, the need for dogma and many other ""shattering"" realizations. I don't feel that a proper review can be written for this book--it is too stupid, profound and obscure. Pegging this book down is like kicking a hyena in the face for laughing."
2,Shame,"this is a plain vanilla edition of this wonderful, holy book. And they copywrited it, against the holy traditions of POEE and Discordians everywhere, SHAME"
1,"This is incomplete, lacks graphics","The original had a great deal of graphic design element, including pictures, tables, and various fonts. These contributed to the message and humor, and editions which faithfully reproduce them are available for free as PDFs on the internet."
5,The last book anyone should read,"Read this book only after you have read books by Hayek, Marx, Nietzsche, Hume, Locke, Tocuquillve, then you will appreciate what this book is talking about, then you will understand why Marx and Nietzsche is equally wrong. This is the bible of a human being with right mind, or as someone says, this is the Bible of a Billionaire. This is what Euripides says in his play Cyclops, ""Money is wise men's god, rest are just babbling"".It is the most refreshing book a man can ever find. Better than Nietzsche's."
3,BB's are fine for small guns. Packaging is horrible,"Buy the plastic bottle. I can just see the milk carton getting knocked over and chasing 2500 bb's under the furniture, out of the AC ducts, and everywhere in between.BB's seem accurate in the Crossman 760 smaller bb gun. Grouping is great, accuracy is predictable. Able to aim within an inch and a half of Bullseye at 30 ft. (which could also be the site on the gun is slightly off). The key is the bb's are predictable so it is easy to adjust once you see where the first shot lands.I wonder if the other reviewer received a defective batch of bb's."
4,Solid Film,"I give The Search for Spock 3.5 stars, as it's not as good as the previous film (Wrath of Khan), but it nevertheless entertains. The Klingons are in full force in this one, with some tacky fight scenes. I'm not being negative here; sometimes tacky is good. The story is an interesting one, centered around the resurrection of Spock, while conflict erupts over the Genesis device. Overall, this film is a worthwhile watch."
3,Not gluten-free!!!,"I always worry about the newly diagnosed Celiac or gluten-intolerant misreading wheat-free as gluten-free. This is obviously not a gluten-free recipe book although I found it in my search for ""vegetarian-gluten-free books."" The first recipe I noticed contained barley which is glutinous. Beware!"
3,Not 2 bad of a vamp flick,"With the recent vampire film and book madness sweeping the world over the past decade, it is hard to find a good vampire flick nowadays. But, Midnight Son is a descent bloodsucker film. So if you are a vampire fan check this one out and you might like it. I thought it was a descent film."
3,MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST BE FRIENDS,"The film is a modern take on the vampire theme minus the supernatural and magical elements. Twenty-four year old Jacob (Zak Kilberg) is a recluse who paints and works nights as mall security. He meets Mary (Maya Parish) who likes the nose candy and has her own issues. Through a series of events Jacob discovers he likes blood, human blood like a fat kid likes cake.He develops cravings which gets him into the expected mess as one might guess when someone craves human blood. You don't see everything that happens. This is to create the feeling of Jacob's black outs and the production's budgetary concerns. Such is art.The movie ends at the point it would start to make an interesting film such as ""Psychos in Love"" which I liked better.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Maya Parish)"
1,What am I missing?,"This is not a vampire movie. If you are expecting a classic vampire story, then this is not for you. This movie s*cks and I don't understand why so many people have given this movie a high rating."
3,Atleast more interesting than near dark.,"This came at the vampirism issue with a completely different approach which made it a little more interesting. The difficulties in learning how to deal with the disease concept, I suppose. Unless I missed it however, it never really gave much indication on how the whole thing began that part was kind of vague."
4,DARK EFFECTIVE TALE IS QUITE DIFFERENT,"MIDNIGHT SON is an intriguing and innovative spin on the vampire genre. Zack Kilberg is quite effective as Jacob, an introverted young security guard, besieged with a bizarre medical condition. He is unable to tolerate direct sunlight, a condition that eventually leads him to crave and require human blood. Maya Parish is convincing as the coke-snorting street vendor he becomes enamored with and whose bloody nose triggers his bloodlust.The movie serves as both a unique horror tale and a warning about addiction.MIDNIGHT SON leaves some unanswered questions and the editing is often choppy. But it creates some eerie atmospheric tension and works well as a low-budget indie."
5,very good movie,"Not the best movie ever but one of the better movies I have seen on amazon. he is a vampire in the sense that he needs blood and if he slobbers on you, you will be a vampire, the sun burns, but no long teeth,turning into wolves or bats, and no fog. You do get to see the girls boobs in this movie, very important point."
5,Sublime,"The acting in this film is top notch. Swayze is perfection. As a teacher, I have used selected scenes from the film to teach my students. Whether it is like the book or not is irrelevent. It's a film that makes everyone who views it proud to be American, no matter where you are from."
1,Wake up!!!,"I agree, where is the DVD? $200 for a soon to be obsolete format?? Get real!!!! This is an excellent mini-series on the worse medium."
1,"Simply, The BEST TV Movie ever made!!","Without rehashing the storyline and who's in it, North & South Book I, ( along with BookII) is a fantastic epic covering probably the most romantic period in American history. It follows the real historical timeline and events during that time pretty accurately, interweaving an allstar cast of GREAT characters that keep you glued to your seat and makes you want to watch all the videos in one sitting!(I've done this several times!)....I only wish they would put it out on DVD..Sidenote: Don't waste your time with Book III, it is a big piece of garbage and really bad writing!...you have been warned.Norm"
5,"North and South, Book I","I just watched this movie for the first time and I LOVED it!! I wanted to see it because I love Genie Francis and Hal Holbrook. They both turned in excellent performances, but so did the entire cast. This movie has something for absolutely everyone. I can't wait to see Book II!!"
5,EXCELLENT,I love the videos. They are excellent. I bought them several years ago and have watched them many times. One good thing about it is that it follows pretty close to the novel. There is excellent chemistry between the charachters and the cast is all-star-from the evil David Carradine to the fanatic Kirstie Alley to Patrick Swayze.
5,My favorite miniseries.,"This miniseries is the perfect example of how a book should be made into a movie. These days, when a book is turned into a movie, there isn't enough time to do everything.Anyway, this saga is about two families-- one from the north and one from the south-- that are friends before and during the civil war. It shows how they meet, how they become friends, and how entwined thier lives are before the war starts. As the political strife heats up, it shows how the two families react to each other, to their own families, and to everyone around them. This is a classic story about war, love, revenge, history, and politics.I first saw it when I was in grade school and was thrilled when they showed it again on tv (I'm going to buy it once its released on DVD). Book II is equally good-- although they changed the ending. Book III was a bit rushed, but it was interesting to see how they worked around the changed ending in Book II."
1,Typical Clay Walker,"Clay Walker is a good country singer, but his albums lack quality. There are usually only 2-4 good songs on his albums, and those are the ones we hear on the radio. Whoever is responsible for putting his albums together mostly puts fillers in for the rest of the songs on the albums. You will only enjoy the album if you are a definite Clay Walker fan, otherwise buy your favorite singles from him."
5,Its a sad shame that MotorCity Online is no more...,It was one of the greatest games I have played online and not just for the playability and graphics but for the friends I made from the time of Beta til the death of MCO...and if MCO does return from the grave..I'll be there ;)
5,Best Racing Game I've EVER Had!,"This is the greatest racing game. I don't know how I could go back to a game offline, now that I race and chat with real people every day.There is a monthly fee ..., but IT'S WORTH IT!It works great with my HP Pavilion 1.6GHz Windows XP. I didn't have much trouble installing it. It was a little confusing at first, but that's because I am new to the Windows OS. I've had a Mac for years.I'm sure that anyone who is familiar with the Windows system, will have no trouble installing the software.Anyhow, BUY THIS GAME & I'll see you on the Track!"
1,Very Disapointed in EA.,"I was very excited to get this game. As an avid motorhead and collector car nut, this game held much promise. But I was sorely disapointed to find that after my initial $40 layout for the game , I would be forced to pay $9.99 a month to continue using this game. This fact was not made clear, it appears in miniature writing on the back of the box if you read that far. It says nothing in the instruction book about a monthly payment. I am now in a tight spot as to getting my money back without losing anything. Do not buy this game unless you want to pay them $120 a year for the privilege."
2,UNHAPPY WITH FEE,"I PLAYED THE OLD GAME STREERODS FOR THE AMIGA AND IT""S THE SAME IDEA , BUYING CARS AND PARTS TO BUILD UP YOUR CAR, TO FINALLY RACE FOR MONEY OR TITLES. THIS GAME WITH IT""S GRAPHICS ARE GREAT, BUT THE IDEA OF ONLINE FEES IS NOT RIGHT.SO, IF YOU LIKE THE IDEA OF PAYING TO RACE THEN BUY IT, BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY TO PLAY IS PAY."
1,Game server no longer active,This game is no longer active as the servers that ran the game shut down long ago. ALthough when the game was active i would have to give it a perfect score because the game was awesome. EA should definitely revamp and restart motor city online.
4,game no longer is in service,this was a great game. but EA no longer supports it. so save your money dont buy it. look at ea.com for info about this out of date game
2,Its Over,"well, no point in buying thsi game, i did about 4 months ago, then they decide to stop running it, and give us either the sims online or ultima online or earth and beyond, as if walking around on the sims is near as fun as racing and tuning up your car"
5,Car Racing At Its Coolest,All I can really say is that I can't tear my 9 yr old away from the computer because of this game he loves it! You race others online and win money to buy your own cars and if you ruin your car then you can buy new parts from others or a junkyard they have all kinds of great stuff for you to do. You can sponser teams and get paid a salary and lots more! O fcourse the money is only fake online money but they make is seem so real and all the things you can do keeps my kid interested and that's a hard enough accomplishment!1
1,hewimp,"The Game no longer supported. trying to steal from someone don't be fooled this game will not Work.Fun when ea had it up and running they Dropped it.your buying a cd just for looks they should not allow this game to be sold,"
2,Nothings for free,"MY 12 year old son wanted this game, he spent 2 months allowance (40.00) to buy it only to find out that it would cost him another 9.99 a month to play.Since we already opened the box we couldn't take it back so now he's stuck with a 40 game he can only use for 30 days( the free trial) No where in the instructions does it say it costs actually it says set up your free account. I finally found in very small print on the back of the box that there is a SMALL monthly fee, to a kid 9.99 is not a small fee.That's fine is they charge but they should make that perfectly clear like in big letters on the front of the box. I was really disappointed because he did really like the game. I wrote to EA game hoping that maybe they would reinburse his money but I'm not holding my breath. So unless you're willing to pay the fee don't buy it."
1,Motor City Costs (...) to play,"Do not buy this product unless you wish to pay (the cost) per year in service fees for ""online"" play which is the only mode the game will function. I could not even install it because I would not provice EA.com with my credit card so they could start the service contract and billing me in my sleep."
1,Racing at its Worst,"After buying the game you'll be paying ten bucks a month to play it and the learning curve will be long - very long, just the way EA intended. If you want to race, and not spend years earning money to buy parts, in order to be competitive - look elsewhere. The beta-testers may love it - they played for free for months and learned the game but I'd rather have an even playing field when I do my on-line battles and I'll pass on the role playing aspect too."
4,Good Sample for the Summer of Love,"It's bizarre that virtually no one reviews these Classic Sixties Collection CDs, since it's quite a good series. This one representing 1967 is one of my favorites, since it's got a good sample of the big hits from that Summer of Love year. Sound quality is quite good too, although I don't know if the songs have been remastered. Another good 1-CD collection isAm Gold: 1967, although it's not quite as good as this one. Or, if you'd rather splurge for a bigger 1967 collection,Summer Of Love: The Hits of 1967box set is a very good one, containing 2 CDs and 1 DVD, although actually this CLASSIC SIXTIES COLLECTION: 1967 CD is more even in quality than the box set is. However, in the case of all these collections, some big names like the Rolling Stones and the Beatles are missing, presumably because the producers didn't have access to those recordings. Nevertheless, these are some groovy CDs, man!"
4,Some good tricks...,"I'm a first grade teacher trying to figure out a way to teach math facts and introduce them systematically into our curriculum. This system seems very time consuming to use for all children in a classroom - but with parent help, it might work.I do like the ideas for parents though...I've used the suggestions in this book with my first grader who is learning addition math facts. He especially likes the idea of the Quick Card (page 15) that tells how to move facts mastered to a stack of cards you don't have to practice as much. It's a systematic way to teach and practice the facts. I also like the maintenance plan (p. 87) that recommends you practice 20 cards of the mastered stack each day. I believe building a strong math fact foundation will help kids all the way through elementary math and beyond!I do have one caution: teaching all of the ""tricks"" for addition may be confusing. You have to pick and choose the tricks to teach based on the individual child!"
4,"Good, but not my fav.","I do not think that this is the easiest book to teach from. It isn't just pre-made activities, you have to read it, learn it, and then figure out how to fit it in with what you already have to teach.The concepts are sound, however."
5,Lego Star Wars V-Wing Fighter,My 11 yr. old son loves Lego's in general. I brought him a few of the Star Wars Legos for Christmas and he put them together rather quickly and has been enjoying them ever since.He claims he wants to be an Architect so maybe Legos do have an educational value as well.
3,"Great book, but a little worn out","The book is great, although some people would have trouble reading because of the wording. I bought it used and the conditions were a little worse than I expected."
3,"A classic tripod, but......","I just purchased this tripod, based on the reviews I had read, and the reputation that wood tripods have for being steady, vibration-resistant, and just plain old-fashioned styling.The only downside I have found about this tripod is that when it is used on a smooth surface, like wood floors or ceramic tiles, the legs, with the slightest pressure bulge out, creating a very unsteady base. I think I would need metal cables going around the inside of the legs (there are three slots), in order to keep the legs from slaying outward. I can imagine that on a soft, grass surface, the spikes on the legs' tips would dig into the ground, preventing the legs from moving outward. The Berlebach manual does not mention this problem, and the tripod's website does not mention it, either. My heavier Giotto or my lightweight fiber carbon tripods do not have this disadvantage. Is this expected from wood tripods, or do I have a defective unit. Any suggestions are welcome, please!"
3,Very Mini Dachshund Pin,"Very cute pin, but much smaller than I expected. Its tiny. It almost gets lost on clothes. With the cost of shipping, it is not worth the price. If it was cheaper or you find it in a store, than go for it. My mom who owns two Dachshunds did enjoy it though."
1,Armrest is not part of package,"this package doesnt include armrest, when i recieved this shipment, i compained amazon about missing part and they send me replace shipmentbut in replacement shipment as well this piece is missing, i called amazon and they are not sure if it is part of this packageBad part- armrest is missing so uselessGood part- It is from amazon so no issue in refund/return(best part of amazon)"
3,Outdated Insight,"I have to be a bit tougher with this rating than I would like (as an admirer of the late Professor Rossiter.) This book is, however, in large part as good as a snapshot in time can ever be. The title leads the reader to think the book may be more encompassing than it is. Much (most?) of the book focuses on the time contemporaneous with its writing - 1959-1960. There is nothing wrong with that if that is your focus -if not, however, the read will appear, and is... dated; still - well written and lucid."
4,Life in a Small Town,"As a young 87 year-old, Dorothy is a lively character who lives on a farm in small-town Partonville. She loves God, her family and friends, and her dog Sheba. Even tho Dorothy has had her share of tragedy, she finds the humor, joy and blessings of life, sticks by her old friends and welcomes new ones. And through Dorothy we become acquainted with many of the town locals. This is an easy-going story and so refreshing to be reminded what's important in life! This is the second book in the series (I enjoyed the first as well), and plan to read the remaining books to find out what Dorothy is up to next."
4,Slightly heavier going than the first one,"I was interested to experience Dorothy's family at last.The religious aspect is less subtle than the previous story. Also, I couldn't get into all the angst about The Tank, etc. That sub-plot left me cold. The Katie - Jessica parts grew a bit tedious - although they were worth it for me in the end; I really hope that Katie continues to encourage Jessica's creativity.The next one ought to be interesting. Katie and Josh's arrival in town was kinda rushed toward the end of this book (overshadowed by The Auction, etc.) I'd like to see more of the adjustments they've had to make."
1,Look at any other book on the topic,"The book has few positive features which are utterly overcompensated for by what it completely lacked.It doesn't discuss actual technical writing at all. It mentions passive-vs-active voice once -- on page 218ish.It covers only the most superficial points, like audience analysis, maybe a bit on the research (vaguely), and the like. Then it offers reams of the most general expository verbiage on how to go about the most wide-ranging of writing tasks (letters, research-papers...).There are already books about writing business letters. There are several books on writing a thesis or dissertation too.Compared to those, this book fails with style.If you are interested in learning technical writing, then you almost definitely already have a working mastery of everything that will be presented in this book.This book would be well suited to 7th grade junior high-school students in the US."
2,Ok for a younger crowd,"I bought this book for a class I am taking in my seinor year at college and after reading a couple chapters from the beginning and the end of the book I felt like this book would be better off for a younger crowd. Mabey freshmen in highschool, or younger but book came off as a poor attempt to make a techical writing book for the adult. All the information that the book held was things that i had been tought through middle school through highschool. Over all if you are looking for a book for your younger readers to take something away from this is it but if you have adults you wouldent want to wast your time or money."
2,Soundly Disappointed!,"Owned the LP record of this concert in the late 70s. It had wonderful highs (Elvis recognises ""the girl with the beautiful high voice"") and lows that I believe came from a French Horn. Am very disappointed that neither of these come through clearly and with emphasis on the DVD sound track, even though played on modern and sophisticated system."
1,recording no good,"I saw the real program on TV and I liked it. Now I bought the VHS program and the cassette was a mess. I sent an email to Lightyear.com too. It came out with a red background and full of horizontal lines. I have not returned the cassette because your policy requires the article to be sealed. How do I know if the recording was any good if I do not try it. It was played on three different 4 heads players and in all the same problem. I decided to junk it and let you know how I feel. I am not going to spend shipping and postage for the fun of it.Thanks, Ernesto"
1,don't buy this,"I taped the orginal concert in stereo this video is not in stereo, so if you have a good sound system you will be Disappointed"
2,Elvis - Aloha From Hawaii,"The copy that I bought had a huge glitch in ""Long Tall Sally"", spoiling the quality of the DVD. Also, the track titles do not match the Index. I have played the disc in other DVD's and the problem is persistent. I had Amazon replace the disc, problem was found on the second DVD. I was unable to determine if it was processed poorly or if it was on the ""Master"" that way. Big disappointment that ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" was not included."
2,A Subdued Performance From a Star,"This concert has its moments, but it's too bad that in one of Elvis's most widely-seen appearances he is so subdued. Word has it that he was extremely nervous and didn't want to take any chances on stage -- and it shows. He looks good, but appears stiff and is almost immobile at times. If you really want to see Elvis come alive on stage, buy Elvis On Tour. In that film, he's much looser and the live footage has the feel of a real rock concert. This appearance is too bland and packaged."
4,ELVIS PRESLEY IN TOP FORM!,"Elvis Preley, one of the biggest legends of all time. He is remembered for his extraordinary voice, ecentric style, and dynamic showmanship. Here in a 1973 television special,we see the King in his prime. The video shows excellent glimpses and shots at what the man did best: perform. The beauty of the ""Elvis Concert"" is shown, and sure other critiques have been made on the 'Aloha' concert, that Elvis' moves weren't that dynamic, Elvis seemed tired: ""Hey he was probably nervous-he performed for over one billon people""! The show is excellent for anyone who is a fan, music lover, or a person who digs pop-culture. Be sure not to miss Elvis at his last pinnacle, ""Aloha From Hawaii. Some points that stand out are: -See See Rider -Suspicious Minds -Something -American Trilogy -My Way -Fever -Elvis' 'American Eagle Jumpsuit'"
4,EXCELLENT BUT SONGS INCOMPLETE!,"I WISH REAL AL0HA ROCKED THIS WELL BUT SOME SONGS TAKEN OUT ON THIS AND OFFICIAL VERSION, WASTE OF MONEY! YOU WANT WHOLE THING, DUH! MOST IMPORTANT SONG JOHNNY B GOODE MISSING, SHAME!"
2,BE CAREFUL ITS NOT FULL VERSION!!!,"IF U R BUYIN THIS VERSION ONLY FOR HISTORICAL PURPOSE, OK, BUT 3 SONGS WERE CUT OUT, BMG GRACELAND R2CHEAP AS USUAL, ALWAYS RELEASE SAME THING JUST TO RELEASE IT ALL OVER AGAIN WITH ONLY ONE EXTRA SONG, TOTAL LOWLIFES! CANT BE TRUSTED!YOU CAN MAKE SONG SHORTER OK,BUT TAKIN EM OUT IS SIN!HOW CAN U EVEN WATCH IT WITHOUT THROWIN UP!"
3,"Love the album, but the cassette was warped","the album is normally EXCELLENT, but the cassette I received is warped in sports and the sound isn't right. It is unfortunate."
1,Terrible Price,"The title grabbed me at the very beginning. (I just wrote an essay on this topic so I was very interested.) That is, until I saw the price. $108 for a book? No way I'm buying it. If you wanna sell your book, give it a WAY lower price."
4,escape from the tropical heat,"Looking for Alaska is a book that makes you want to be in the beauty of Alaska one minute and really glad that you are not there the next.From Peters descriptions of the beauty of the scenery , to the warmth of the population and the diversity of the people, the humorous story of the rescue of Mother moose and her baby from a swimming pool, (one wonders at the need of an outside swimming pool in Alaska) to the spine chilling account of a Bear attack and attacks by other animals, Looking for Alaska is a good read from cover to cover.Peter meets many different people on his travels and they all open up to him with the result that the reader feels the enjoyment and the fear of day to day living in this wild part of the world.Thank you Peter, the vividness of your writing took me away from the sweltering heat of Brisbane's hottest summer in 90 years, and in some ways made me even appreciate that heat!!"
2,Too much of Jenkins' personal life; not enough Alaska,"This is the first Peter Jenkins book I have read and I was a bit disappointed. There are some good Alaska moments here, but they are drowned out by Jenkins' personal reminiscences. If I wanted to hear about how melancholy he is about his daughter growing up and moving away I would have bought a different book. I wanted to read about Alaska-- and I found too little of that in this book. (For the record, I lived in Fairbanks for 3 years-- I was looking for the quirkiness and beauty that I remember from Alaska in this book. It wasn't there)."
1,Poorly written,"I wanted to read this book- my wife had read it, and recommended it to me, albeit with reservations. I have been to Alaska several times, and was familiar with many of the places Peter Jenkins was writing about, but.... the poor grammar, the sloppy writing, as if he wrote and submitted his first draft to his publisher without proofreading it. More astonishing, doesn't St. Martins' Press employ a proofreading editor? I would guess Mr. Jenkins has a good story to tell, but I couldn'y get past the second chapter before giving up in disgust"
5,Should be required listening for anyone going to Alaska,"My mother and I are going to Alaska for a month, her treat for me getting my MBA.I got her this book on tape, her favorite way of experiencing books and she absolutely loved this one. She said it was like being there, with voice excerpts of several of the main characters like they did in `Band of Brothers'.Get it, listen, she was there for over twelve hours, you will be too. She tells me this is the best way to prepare for our adventure there she could imagine."
2,two stars for the subject,"I don't quite understand why this book has been getting such good reviews...I didn't think it was that good. Jenkins' writing is very simple, quite choppy - jumping from one subject to the next with no apparent connection, and inserting useless information in the middle of a narrative - and filled with cliches. He doesn't seem to have a whole lot of skill with the language, and maybe it's just the English major in me coming out, but I expect better from my authors. Overall, I thought Looking for Alaska read a bit too much like a rough draft.That said, the subject is amazing (and the reason I bought the book) and so it gets two stars anyway."
4,Alaska Found,"Peter Jenkins went looking for Alaska and he found it. He does not just write about it. He first explores it, personally experiences its inseparable risks and rewards (bears, moose, whales, ice, cold, wind, remoteness, wild, free, majestic, and occupied by brave and fearless residents)and then describes his adventures and the people who occupy this land. His narrative is first hand and exciting. He takes us with him (usually accompanied by a guide)kayaking within 75 feet of a 50,000 pound breaching humpback whale,60 miles into the ""bush"", and to the edge of the land-fast ice with Eskimos waitng to harpoon a 100,000 pound bowhead whale. If you have never been to Alaska, the book makes you want to go there. If you have been there, it makes you want to go back."
1,????,"Seems to be a problem.....this book was ordered in May, 2010 but we have not yet received it. Would be happy to review it once we get the chance to read it.Looking for Alaska"
2,Alaska is in there somewhere...,"Alaska is big...but I still could not quite see it. I quickly realized that Peter Jenkins was in the way. He has an annoying style of cliches, metaphors and personal observations. The (rhetorical) questions simply get in the way and jolts me out of the moment. The stories are there and they are interesting if he would stop inserting himself. I did finish the book and at the end, I did find that I did get a slight peek of Alaska.It seemed like this book was a rough draft of his notes with no flow or structure to hang these stories on.Save your money and look for this book in your local library.\\\\\"
5,Like being there yourself,"This book was recommended by a friend who knew I enjoyed the outdoors and travel.I was totally amazed at the research the author did for every part of this book. Actually moving his family to Alaska so he could live within the small, close knit communities. His acceptance wasn't always immediate, but when he was ""approved"" by the locals, his experiences with the people and the land became true to life.Mr. Jenkins ability to explain his life in Alaska and that of the real residents, leaves a huge amount of respect for these true men and women of the last frontier. When I finished the book, Alaska had become a must see for myself."
4,Modern day Alaskan sampler,I learned many things about everyday life in modern Alaska that I hadn't previously known or given thought to. Years ago I read several of Jenkins earlier books and I was not disappointed by this one. He brings to life an assortment of Alaskan characters and drives home the over-arching importance of the climate and adjusting the pace of everyday life to the demands of the extreme weather and sometimes isolation it enforces. Recommended reading for anyone planning a visit to the fiftieth state.
4,Book Review,"This is a very entertaining book about the trans-america travels (walks) by the author. It tends to capture not only his adventures, but also the nature of the America as he knew it."
4,Looking for Alaska,I am still in the process of reading this book but what I have read so far is really great. I am looking to travel to Alaska in 2009 and a travel consultant I have been talking to recommended that I read this book.The book really gives a great insight into the ordinary every day Alaskan lives which has just made me want to see Alaska even more.I recommend this book to anyone whether you want to see Alaska or not. It is just a great read.
4,Fun....,"Looking for Alaska is a series of stories describing Peter Jenkins' two year trip to what many have termed the final frontier. From the Kenai Peninsula to Barrow, from Deering to Fairbanks, Jenkins proceeds to locate the appropriate hosts, immerse himself in their surroundings, and describe with palpable wonder the experience for his readers.Yet, Peter Jenkins is not a writer who travels. He cannot create the finely crafted sentences of Bill Bryson, William Least Heatmoon, or Jonathan Raban. More simply, Mr. Jenkins is a traveler who writes, though his exuberance and sincerity provide ample compensation for those expecting a wordsmith.I thoroughly enjoyed Looking for Alaska and felt throughout that, rather than reading a book written by someone unknown, I was being given the long-awaited lowdown on the journey of an adventurous friend."
2,"Great potential, disappointing result","I've been a big fan of Peter Jenkins since he first published ""A Walk Across America"" but I was really disappointed by ""Looking For Alaska"". In the ensuing years Jenkins seems to have lost his storytelling style that made me really love his earlier works. ""Looking For Alaska"" is disjointed and choppy and doesn't do justice to the wonderful state of Alaska and its' people."
3,Very Worthwhile,"If you are looking for more contemporary renditions of the DeSylva,Henderson & Brown song catalogue, this is it. Produced by Ben Bagley in the late 1960's, some nice jazzy arrangements and a few more recent recordings are included.Birth of the Blues: Songwriter SeriesDeSylva, Brown & Henderson Revisited, Vol. 2"
2,Disappointed customer,"I bought this video for my two-year-old daughter and was very disappointed. The people on the tape are a strange orange color and the quality is very poor. Also, my daughter became bored with the tape after about ten minutes. I would not recommend this video."
4,Coffee,I am really enjoying this coffee maker. It is very easy to work. You can ajust the temp. of the coffee which is a great feature.
2,Great price but could be better,"I finally had to send this back even though it was a great price. First off it was very loud which doesn't sound like a big problem but when you use the timer in the morning and not everyone in the house needs to get up it can be annoying. Second, on 2 different occasions the coffee ground compartment opened during brewing and made a mess. I did learn that a reconditioned product is just like new this one just had some design flaws."
3,make sure you close the basket all the way!,The feature set for this item is very nice. The only problem I have is with how easy it is to think you have closed the basket with the grounds all the way and it is not. This will cause the grounds and hot water to overflow and make you start your brewing cycle all over again once you have cleaned up the mess. It has happened three times since I received the unit. The third time I was absolutely sure that the basket was securely closed.
5,Guitar Strings,I was asked to purchase this as a gift. I was told they are one of the best to use for a guitar.
5,it's the one,"grew up on the williams brother,my whole family love them.and we now have all of the williams brother whole collection."
3,The Ruins of California,"Received this item, in good condition as stated, in a timely manner and for a good price through Amazon.com.This book was chosen as our book of the month in my book club.Personally, this book was disappointing. I like more action and a really good reason to hurry up and turn the next page. It lacked secrets, betrayals, and action (there was one bit of action but it was over way too soon) and a good ending. I love reading a book where you delay reading the last few pages because you don't want it to be over. I read to the end so I could discuss it with the girls.However, there were others in the club who did enjoy it (one gal loved it!). She liked the dialogue and the relationships and the locations. Every book is not for every reader and thank goodness that there are thousands of artists to meet all of our needs."
4,Appropriate subtitle . . .,"This is a well-written story of a great horse, but the story is more than just the horse itelf. The author does a fine job of providing insight and understanding into the cutural forces that shaped America and American horse racing during the time of Native Dancer's reign. Throughout the book, the author provides a contextual backdrop from which the reader can view the accomplishments of this great horse. Granted, the storyline is not as fairy-tale and movie-ready as Seabiscuit, but the accomplishments of the horse make this one fine read. What hinders the author is the timing of Native Dancer's solo loss. What saves the book is how the author keeps the reader's interest for the rest of the [post-loss] narrative. I am not a student of the horses, but this book was one I had a hard time putting down."
3,worth trying,"A decent game, wasnt too big into it, especially after final fantasy 7, but hey...was good in its own right, even had some nice cinematic battles and such. Some of the side quest stuff and games take some getting used to...but overall a good game."
4,Business Planning- a tool for success,"The ABS Ultimate Business Planner 2.0 provides an excellent tool for the experienced or novice individual who is challenged to write a well organized business plan. While the tool may not work for all who want to add a special flair or the business does not require all the facets as what the plan calls for, the tool does make you think- ""how does this apply to my business?""While the tool takes some getting used too, it can be mastered by the most novice or experienced person."
1,Going to try it anyway...,... even though a quick linguistic entropy analysis might suggest that all three 5-star reviews were written by the same person. Hmm.
2,not the best I've seen,Too many pictures of tourists not so many of the beautiful landscape of Australia. Made for an American public.
3,Not great,"This was not as good as I expected for a Scholastic publication. It has a lot of advertising. That surprised me. Parent or Parenting are just as good, if not better, magazines."
1,"Too mainstream, nothing different","I plan to call and have my subscription cancelled. This magazine is way too mainstream for my family and also does not offer anything fresh or different from any of the other ""parenting"" magazines."
4,A book that left a strong memory from my childhood.,"A wonderful story that has stayed in my mind from my childhood. I would recommend this 100% for a 4-6th grader. A wonderful story of family, warmth and caring, with humor and adventure. I sought this book out for my own children to read, and they enjoyed it thoroughly."
3,Fine.,A very old fashioned but well done narrative of the history of western music. The book seems to have been reprinted very cheaply. I'd look for another edition if I bought again. There is a huge amount of empty white space on each page and the text is small.
1,Rubbish,This was an exceptionally bad game. The only good part is watching Michael Owen bloody screw up time and time again. He too is rubbish. Not even close the to talents of Thierry Henry or Kevin Phillips for that matter. Don't buy this garbage.
5,FIFA 2002,"Ok, it doesn't matter if it is a good game or not. If it is football it is good. Liverpool FC! Liverpool FC-2 Borussia Dortmund-O hahahhYou'll Never Walk AloneWhen you walk through a stormHold your head up high,And don't be afraid of the dark.At the end of a storm,There's a golden sky,And the sweet silver song of a lark.Walk on through the wind, Walk on through the rain,Though your dreams be tossed and blown...Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart,And you'll never walk alone... You'll never walk alone.Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart,And you'll never walk alone...You'll never walk alone."
3,the series that never ends,"well we say in israel that a good soccer player should know when to quit and i think that EA we supposed to stop riding on the same horse every year , you can learn something from the english anco who made kick off first and then player manager and now play as manager ... time is up fifa !"
3,Not Bad,"Not bad; the best since FIFA 98 RTWC...Cheezy that they leave out the actual World Cup; rather the game just allows World Cup Qualifying (although the Custom tournament mode allows fo rthe creation of a World Cup, but the lack of African teams disturbs me greatly...again, though, I can ""create"" them too if I want...all this is because, like EA's World Cup 98, they will be putting out a game just prior to World Cup 2002 that will focus upon the teams and venuew fro specifically World Cup...but still...)the graphics are okay; with a GeForce 3 they are superb. Crowd reactions were supposed to be revamped; if they were, I don't really see it.Gameplay is very good, except that the passing model, while much better, is a little artificially achieved in that one must be at one of the eight gamepad angles to effectively deliver a pass (no analog). Other than that, the adjustability of the experience is a key update.Not bad; much MUCH better than FIFA 2000 and 2001."
3,Not as good as it should be,"Although I enjoyed myself greatly playing this game, after doing so for a while I came to the realization that the only sure way to score is individual play - no teamwork necessary. This is hardly realistic.However, if you take the time to patch this game with one of the many gameplay patches available at the game's site, the experience will improve. The patch fixes a number of unrealistic instances in the title, such as the goals your opponent will score from the middle of the field, and a seemingly biased referee who overlooks CPU offsides.The graphics are rather good, though not as good as in Fifa World Cup 2002 or Pro Evolution Soccer (PS2). There is, most certainly, room for improvement in this area.But the most important area, namely gameplay, is the real problem. Fifa 98: Road to World Cup, released years ago (in 97) far surpasses the gameplay, realism and, most importantly, fun factor of Fifa 2002.For a better PC footie game, try Actua Soccer 3."
4,Depands On Your Looking For,With no doubt the best fifa game is fifa 99 which is fast and fun. If you are looking for a more complicated game this is the one for you because it's easy to plan complicated passes and stuff here. It's a very fun game and yet it fails to meet the standerts of fifa 99
2,Same old stuff,"My main grudge against the game is AI that isn't playing by the same rules as a human player. Almost any pass AI makes is on target, so the new revolutionary passing system is nothing more but a AI cheat. AI defenders always run as fast as my strikers even if their speed rating is twice less. Marking is unheard of, my defenders stand around like dummies and wouldn't even attempt to make a tackle on their own. Defending against the corners is impossible (again what happened to marking of FIFA 2001??), as well as free kicks,and so on. This list can go on forever.Don't buy this game, unless of course you like playing a cheating AI."
5,"Much fun, which is everlasting!","FIFA SOCCER 2002 is great! With make your own players, teams, leauges and cups, YOU'LL NEVER STOP PLAYING THIS GAME! I play it almost twice a day. While your reading this, I'll probaly still be playing it. It has over 500 teams from about more that 30 leauges! MLS, K-league, English Premireship, Italian Leauge, You name it. I'm nine and got it for helping out. I really did'nt do much and got a game that I didn't deserve. Good price. But the coolest thing is that you can make your own players and teams. I made a team of my school with all my friends in it. Oh,only boysare people you can create on the game! ENJOY!"
1,Beware of the MAX requirements for the game as well,I bought the game bundled in best of EA Sports 2002. The good news is I got 4 games for a better price than individual. The bad news I got stuck with a bad FIFA game.The minimum requirements are 200 MHz system. But be warned this game WILL NOT WORK for systems about 2 GHz. This has also been confirmed by customer service at EA Sports. That means if you have a fast system this game will not work. The good news is that the other 2002 games do not have this issue.
2,91/2 Weeks.,The movie did not move with interest for me. I did not finish it. The title 91/2 Weeks was boring. 91/2 Weeks is the title.
3,Not what I remember,"Maybe it's just me but I feel 9 1/2 weeks has just not stood the test of time. I bought it, watched it & nothing. Just disappointed as I remembered so much more or maybe imagined as it had been decades since it came out?"
3,It's OK,It's an OK movie. I probably wouldn't watch it again. Seemed disjointed to me. I don't think that this was Basinger's finest hour.
1,9 1/2 weeks,"Everyone always talks about this movie. Maybe it was great in its time, but it pretty much stinks now."
1,BAD QUALITY DVD,This dvd was very back. All the seller did was just transferred the movie to dvd. There are a lot of blank section. This was not worth the month spent.
5,Very pleased,I received my DVD promptly and in very good condition as was advertised. Would do business with this seller again.
2,Kim Basinger fans beware...,"As you probably have guessed from my review title, I am somewhat of a Kim Basinger fan and so the extra star I'm giving for this review goes to her. She has the looks and the acting skills which pretty much gaurantees success for any actress. So I was up one night channel surfing and I came across this 9 1/2 Weeks movie. I figured since there was nothing else on I would go ahead and watch it. Well, despite the bit of sleazy content I couldn't really identify what the actual plot was. My only guess is that Mickey Rourke is trying to get Kim Basinger to see the erotic side of art pictures along with having a relationship with her that is only based on sex. Aside from this mediocre plot, the rest of 9 1/2 Weeks seems to drag. I can't imagine the sequel to this movie being any better or any worse for that matter."
4,Controlling,"Very steamy, every one should do this once in your life. These two got a chance to have something we all want just don't know how to make work. Take a lot of trust and I'm nowhere near there."
2,The Movie Was OK,It was an ok movie nothing big. i saw the unrated version and i dont see what was so unrated about it. watch Wild Orchid it was much better.
2,Does not live up to the hype,"It is not good as a mainstream movie , it does not have a good plot , some scenes are not relevant .Even as a soft-porn movie, it does not do a good job. Try watching ""I like to play games"" , its a much better soft-porn movie."
2,"""Good..... I think not""!","I thought it was rather boring myself. All they did was have sensual sex, and so what?. I wasn't excited over this movie at all. I guess it was suppose to be an erotic thriller, but to me it .... To be honest 2 stars is really being too kind."
1,9 1/2 Weeks,"I don't know why I bought this. Must be because the movie was so cheap. I should have realized that not buying would be cheaper. To be fair, the movie was not bad, just wasn't worthwhile for collection. Besides VHS is an obsolete choice."
3,The things you can do with fruit!,"This film caused quite a stir when it came out, but with the passage of time one has to ask why. Kim Basinger's devotion to Mickey Rourke never seems very believable, while for much of the movie he seems to be parodying his own part. One thing that can be said in its favor is that it captures the atmosphere of New York much better than most films. Also, even if Miss Basinger's striptease is pretty ludicrous, the video is almost worth getting just to listen to Joe Cocker's ""You Can Leave Your Hat On"". As for the fruit scene, well, it must have been more fun acting in it than it is watching it."
4,Wild and Romantic,"Mickey Was his wonderfull romantic self in 9 1/2 and it made as a good ""fall in love movie""."
4,9 1/2 Weeks,"This is a great movie if you are watching it with that special someone in your life. The love scenes were very tastefully done. My only complaint is the quality of the DVD is not much better than my VHS copy, so if you want to save the difference in cost I would suggest getting the tape. Enjoy!"
4,Blu-ray,"The review of the blu ray is one topic the review of the movie another one. The blu-ray initially seemed to indicate sharper pictures but only at the start.The movie can be seen either as erotic as well as moralist. Erotic by the combination of a good match of a couple together with actions that increased adrenaline in characters depicted as well as in viewers of the movie with well selected music for the action.Moralistic in the sense that at the final the major feminine role ( Kim Bassinger) painfully renounces all those attractive aspects of a life full adventure, pleasure and money in favor of one much similar to the one of the painter that she has brought to a display in her gallery.When I get hungry, I eat when I get thirsty, I drink... is one key aspect of the dialogue the painter has with her before the display of his work at her gallery of art. The world of fashion is marked by famous characters as one of the Rolling Stones ( Woods , I think)"
1,91/2 weeks Uncut Version Blu Ray,"The Blu ray transfer is very bad. Full of grains, it's extremely painful to watch. Did not finish watching the movie."
2,Jaded by time,I was looking forward to finally watching this movie. When it came out I was in my 20's and did not get around to it. I always thought 'well it is a movie that I would prefer to watch in my living room with the right guy'. Well now many years later...I wish I had watched it before there were so many truly fabulous movies that I have seen in the last 25 years. What a disappointment :( and not a turn on at all!
3,Not Bad Not Great,For Two stars like Kim Basinger And Mickey Rouke. You would of thought it would have A better diaolog to it.
4,Edited?,"I was kind of disappointed. I love this moving, but some of the scenes from the original were missing. I'm guessing they may have be a little racy, but this whole move plays on the edge. If parts are to be edited out, that should be stated up front upon purchasing. The movie itself is flirty and edgy for it's time. I really like Mickey Rourke in this film."
1,"Terrible Movie, don't waste your time","Oh my goodness, this movie was terrible. I don't know if it's because I skipped over this and have seen Sliver and Eyes Wide Shut before seeing this, but whatever sexual boundaries they are trying to push in this film seen dated and trite and my date and I were really disappointed that neither character killed themselves or the other on at the end."
5,"This movie describes American Sexuality to a ""T"".","This movie shows viewers what they want to see. The ""bad"" side of sex. Which how many people out there can say that they have never had a dominating fantasy, or a fantasy of being submissive? It portrays HUMAN NATURE. People who say this movie is awful, or it was too ""graphic"" are just not comfortable with themselves, or haven't had a date for 4 years. The movie is good, very good. I own the un-rated version, and I watch it at least once a month. I know EVERY WORD to it."
5,A 1980's masterpiece and a must-see for any film fan,"This definitely doesn't belong in the Romance or Drama category. It is worthy of a Steamy, Deviant Sexual Attraction genre all of its own. Basinger and Rourke toy with a fine line between pleasure and pain, and I kept expecting the games to go too far, to turn deadly, and that keeps the viewer and Basinger (as the submissive) on edge throughout the sexually deviant games. The balance of power between the two lovers slowly shifts throughout the movie, making for edge-of-your-seat viewing and a surprising ending.This is a movie that breaks many taboos, not just fun naughty ones, but deep-seated cultural ones. There are some unforgettable scenes (don't miss the striptease scene, which is amazing two decades later!) and a great soundtrack. The apartments epitomize 1980's ""modern"" décor. 9 weeks is a must-see for any film fan."
5,9 1/2 Weeks DVD,"My wife and I love this movie, but it does show a bit of control issues on the part of the main male character. Every time we watch this DVD we get to the point we want to make love. It is a very moving story."
2,I Don't Get It,"Reading through the positive reviews, I find some of them insightful, yet I still feel they exaggerate the depth of the relationship between the two characters. I found it difficult to care for either one of them. I don't find manipulation, humiliation, and game-playing very erotic. A man who can't get excited unless he's degrading a woman, and a woman who appears to find that attractive, are not what I consider sexy. For me the point of this film was waiting to see how long it would take Kim Basinger to finally snap and decide she wasn't going to put up with it anymore. It took her too long, and I found it hard to respect a character who has so little respect for herself. Rourke's smug arrogance was also not very endearing. I felt like this movie was putting me on, and I couldn't wait for it to end."
2,Disappointed,"I saw this years ago and remembered it as being quite raunchy, but years on, it's actually quite slow and laborious."
1,"Sick, big-budget porn movie","This movie is disturbing, offensive, indecent and just plain nauseating. Who is this sick, depressing little piece of trash targeted to? You guessed it, the ... Europeans who indulge in every form of ... imaginable, slobber over XXX-rated movies dealing with sick subjects, and voluntarily make their little children watch it with parents like a ""family night"". Fortunately, we Americans don't need to be forced to watch this garbage. Send it back where it belongs!"
2,No Chemistry,I didn't see any chemistry between these two actors. I was very disappointed in this movie. Definitely not a classic.
1,Not as advertised,This is not the original uncut version that was shown in the theater and was available on tape. It has been totally remade. Many scenes from the original are totally omitted. If you read the book and try to follow it in the movie you will see
3,Probably worth seeing once,"The physical dvd itself is encased in a rather flimsy cardboard and plastic folder. The opening scenes looked like the transfer to dvd was made not from a master but rather from some well-worn film salvaged from a cellar. Beyond these superficial but distracting esthetics (I guess you get what you pay for) the movie starts out with reasonable characters and circumstances. The mental and emotional submission is gradual, calculated, and believable. Unfortunately, the movie seems to go downhill very quickly after Basinger's first violently achieved submission to Rourke -- or perhaps Basinger's plight just became too unmistakably sad and relevant for the movie's message to be well-received. Any possible maturation in Rourke's character as hinted by the end of the movie is weakly developed at best."
5,great buy,"great buy, it arrived on time and looked exactly like the picture on the website. I am still waiting for my husband to return home from his trip to see what he thinks about it. it always helpful to have a set that you can wear when need one around."
4,A story about primitive people,"John is an emotionally undeveloped wimp who seems to have a middle brain so dead he can't get it up in life without resorting to creating artificial scenarios to provoke the most basic drives in himself and his consort. Elizabeth is an unsophisticated and clueless girl who gets wrapped up in John's web of primitive taunts, but ultimately wakes up to his faux lifestyle. The movie is well executed to the point that the whole revolting mess is loudly and proudly portrayed. It's enough to make any reasonable person peauke. Great acting and directing. You'll want to see an action flick after this story just for relief. Give a copy to your kids as a great example of how not to live life."
5,Dig your nails in Erotica,"This is a movie for all of you who like films like Wild Orchid and The Lover. It is a deep look into the lives of two manhattanites who fall into a lust driven affair. There is more than enough glimpses of Kim Basingers body and Mickey Rourke plays John Grey whom I believe to be one of the coolest characters to hit the silver screen.A definate, must have for your collection."
4,Kim Basinger in Prime..nuf said.,WOW....This is the movie that spun my wells as a younger man. Kim Basinger was intense.
5,"Then and now, The best movie after movies.","Mickey Rourke in my humble opinion has always been ahead of times, the Actor who displayed his talent in 1986 and rocking the industry ever since like todays 2005 Sin City and many more films coming up.This film was simply a great movie, Kim is amazing and the director had done his homework keeping this movie on point with such mystery and endless topics one can talk about.Amazon.com delievers fast and I gotta tell ya, this is the ultimate film among many of his work!"
2,Don't believe the hype,There was absolutely no chemistry -as far I could see- between these two. When they were together I felt nothing...the sex was intense but there was nothing which leads up to the sex scenes.I liked the scene with the ice cube but as a previous reviewer stated the scene when he pasted her with honey had me feeling for a bath..i could just imagine that sticking sweet fly bait honey ...Most uncomfortable!This is nowhere close to porn but I can see how it could be a bit risque for the 1986 movie crowd .I never watch 80's movie as I find them almost all terribly bad with the music just as aweful.This is not a date movie....so beware of the reviews which say that it's an appropiate date film.
1,Skip it and rent a porno,"I expected to be pretty turned on after watching this movie, but I was apalled. This movie played on every male-female stereotype. Women are weak minded, men are sex-obsessed, not to mention rape and subordination of women are glamorized and glossed over in an acceptably sick and Hollywood kind of way. Next time I'll just cut to the chase and rent a quality porno instead of subjecting myself to that kind of [stuff]."
1,bad movie,The movie itself was so boring Amazon had no part in that of course they shipped it quickly and I ahd no problem with their service but I tried to watch it and sat through 18 min of boredom don't buy try anything else instead and I heard they came out with a part 2 omg NOOOOOO
1,Mislabeled Trash,"The box says that this video is a ""story of a love affair that breaks every sexual taboo."" I think not. Mickey Rourke doesn't even take his shirt off until one-third of the way into the movie. Except for an occasional glimpse of Kim Basinger's boobs, there is nothing to see. This video has a long way to go before it breaks any taboos. Dull, boring plot."
2,Not what I was lookign for.,Not what I was hoping for. It does not have very much plot and the romantic scenes are not that great. I almost fell asleep. I was bored a few minutes into it and would not recomend it.
4,9 1/2 Weeks,ED.NOTE--WOULD YOU PLEASE CORRECT TYPO IN MY RECENT REVIEW FOR THE DVD 9/12 WEEKS TO INSERT MICKEY ROURKE INSTEAD OF BRUCE WILLIS. OR ELSE ELIMINATE AND ADVISE.HHC
1,What a disappointment!!,"I should have listened to the people who watched this video and didn't like it. It was poorly done with a dry, almost non-existent plot. Watched it once and it went to the dumpster!"
1,Pretty junky,"Mickey Rourke and Kim Bassinger are caught in the spider's web of a sado-masochistic affair. There isn't very much going on in the movie except a string of highly charged and seamy sex scenes. On the whole, the movie adds up to a big zero."
5,"Basinger is hot; best of the bunch; fine film, she's is fine","This unrated edition of the movie version of the novel features the absolutely fine Kim Basinger; who can act, as well as look ""hot"". She's one of the very few women who can move to the song ""You Can Leave Your Hat On"" and sizzle. In fact, she can be sexier, with a facial expression, than some women can with their entire body. What a body! She's a fine actress, talented and beautiful. God Bless the woman. If the novel is anything like the film, and she brings the Elizabeth character to life. Mickey Rourke is good too, and very lucky to have played opposite her and Carrie Otis (who's also fine in Wild Orchid), even if he's a bit of a ""rough"" dude. A kind of less than respectful movie (as I'm sure women would see it) but hey, it's a ""guys"" movie. I'm sure somewhere there's a movie for women that would provoke the same reaction from them. If not, there will be. Give us boys a break, Ok?"
1,Let's Not Kid Ourselves,"This is high-gloss soft-porn; a boring soap opera concentrating on one thing: sex. They actually made sex boring, sad to say, because I defy you to watch this casually and tell me what the storyline was.What this is, is an excuse for Kim Bassinger to show off her great body and for Mickey Rourke to smirk a lot. That's it. Rourke's smugness is so bad it's sickening and Bassinger, despite the great figure, looks cheap more than beautiful.Kudos to the photographer for some nice closeup shots and some wonderful color, but the story is so weak - no character development and no plot - it's unable to compensate. Let's face it: this movie was made for only reason - to titillate male viewers. On that level, it probably succeeded.Those trying to pass this off as ""arty"" and something deeper than soft porn are only fooling themselves."
4,Interesting movie,The plot is about a woman seduced by a guy who does not have her interest at heart. Warning: some nudity and lots of sexual stuff. It was well played and kept your interest.
2,it was ok,"It was ok, but not what I thought. I probably would not have purchased if I had seen it before purchasing online. I had heard good things about this movie. My preference is different."
3,Missing Scene in Instant Version,"9 1/2 Weeks is one of my favorite movies and definitely worth five stars. However, I just watched the Amazon Instant video and it is a watered down version that cuts the pivotal scene where <SPOILER> John (Rourke) tells Elizabeth (Bassinger) that they'll play a game where she needs to crawl on all fours and pick up the money he threw on the ground. If you're a first time viewer of this movie the deletion of this scene might not bother you, but if you're a 9 1/2 Weeks enthusiast like I am, you may find it disappointing like I did."
4,True story here,"I once met a man who was exactly like John. Right down to the evenly spaced crisp white shirts in his wardrobe. You know what I did ? I escaped through the window. I think Elizabeth should have done the same. I couldn't believe in their relationship beyond the 9 1/2 weeks, they'd have had nothing to talk about. Still having said that, I do like it."
4,Great for Slow Pitch Softball Pitchers,"I was looking for a a slow pitch strike zone to practice pitching. What can I say, it totally fits the bill, arrived on time, and merits no complaints. Because I'm a Prime junkie, I opted for this product over one of the non-prime orange extensions. I ended up spray painting it orange so it made a clear target. The spray paint flakes off and requires repainting from time to time, but that is certainly no fault of the product!"
4,Great Album!!!!,"Love Song's second album (Final Touch) followed an album that was a phenomenal success so it was gonna be difficult to make something similar. Final touch in the words of Chuck Girard ""We really did not have such a concept for a second album. Rather, we felt like we were taking leftover songs to a certain degree, and trying to fashion them into something cohesive."" This album didnt make the same impact as the self-titled but it still was a great album with great songs. I really love the last song "" Little Pilgrim"" I believe it is definitely one of their best songs and my favorite in this album!! All songs are good and of course a blessing. Love Song only made 2 albums + 1 live album (Feel the Love) and they reunited in 1994 and made Welcome Back!! I recommend having all 4 albums if you like Love Song!!! They dont make them like this anymore!!!!!!!"
1,"LOOKS CUTE, DOESN'T WORK!",It is completely non-functional - just bought it 3 months ago and now I can't do anything with it. It never went below 60 degrees when it worked.
1,Check Your Sources,"John Keats is belittlingly sexist in his treatment of Dorothy Parker in his biography, saying hideous things like, ""what they [Parker's friends] failed to realize was that Dorothy Parker was like all other women in one terrifyingly simple respect,"" without further explanation, and calling his subject ""little Miss Parker"" throughout. To make matters worse, Keats did not properly check sources, and as a consequence committed grave factual errors in the work. For example, he talks about Dorothy's four years at Miss Dana's finishing school, when Parker only attended the school for a year. The list of mistakes continues."
1,Don't buy it!,"Horribly partial male-chauvanistic telling of Dorothy Parker's life - embarrassingly dated. As Dorothy would have said, this is not a biography to be cast aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force!"
3,A wonderful biography of Dorothy Parker,"I'm glad my father had a copy of this book in his library - I'm sorry to see that it's gone out of print. It's a really good biography of Mrs. Parker - and, one of the best features, has an extensive bibliography at the end, rife with other titles that simply beg to be read."
2,a blu ray fake copy,"A beautifull movie, it does not need explanation, you can read too much good things abouth this clasic. Well done for the movie.BUT, the idea of a blu ray disk is an improvement in quallity. and here you have the same as DVD, not even a good video translation to avoid que small surface, the same ugly sound and 1.33 ratio without filling the space in my XBR LX900. Just more money to the garbage."
2,Boring and terrible actors,"first of all the quality of the Blu-ray was HORRIBLE. The picture and sound were like watching it on regular tv, not even as good as a DVD. I just watched this instead of when I bought it otherwise I would return it. The story was boring, the acting was terrible especially by the main actor, he was terrible in this kind of film. I have always seen him in westerns where he fit in just right, but to me stands out like a sore thumb in this movie, he doesn't have the ump that is normally shown in these type of films. I am a very big fan of any roman picture, not this one though, its going from my collection."
2,Two stars for Deborah Kerr and Peter Ustinov.,"Quo Vadis? is one of the worst sepctacles ever made; D Kerr and Peter Ustinov are the saving graces here, Peter Ustinov as Nero, and D. Kerr with the harder task of being Robert Taylor's love ineterest,And here is the issue with this film, Robert Taylor, possibly one of the worst actors ever to dare put his face on the screen.He is too old, wooden as aways, very American sounding, and no talent at all.What more can be said? He ruins all fims he is in, and yet was used over and over, because Hollywood was afraid he would tell more to the House on Un American Activities, for whom he supplied many many names.An informer, liar, and blacklmailer, his career ended with MacCarthy, thank God.Avoid this and all Taylor films; he's terrible, and terrible even without the facism."
1,Great Movie - Big Disappointment,This is one of the better biblical specticales and what did they do unletterbox it. Picture quality is blu-ray perfect as well as the sound.....I just don't get it. The industry (director's) boast how pan and scan ruins films...I guess they missed the boat...I'm a true fan of this film but I may not watch it in this format.
1,CLASSIC,"EXELLENT CLASSIC MOVIE COMBACK BUT A BIG MISTAKE ,NOT A VARIETY OF TRACK LENGUAGES TRASLATION. LIKE SPANISH OR ITALY OR FRENCH SINCE THIS MOVIE IS CLASSIC WORLD WIDE. NOT RECOMENDED COPY FOR FOREGING FANS .OTHERWISE EXELLENT MOVIE TO WACH."
2,Yawn.,"Somewhere within this Hollywood spectacle is a story about a Roman soldier falling in love with a Christian slave girl. In my quest to review all of the important Biblical epics of the 50s and 60s, this was the ultimate low. I had to break this one up into 3 viewings. Too long, too boring, and much of the acting is weak. You have to be a serious Bible thumper prone to delusions of being persecuted by ""secular humanists"" to enjoy ""Quo Vadis."" Remember to ask your viewing partner to wake you up when they crucify Peter . . ."
5,Another great masterpiece,What can I say regarding MGM spectacular presentation of early Christianity....the burning of Rome.....great filmaking withought the use of computers......back then what were computers......great movie to own.....
2,A so-so copy of an ageless classic,"If you're a sword-and-sandals movie fan, you don't need me to tell you about the movie's content. But the Korean pressing is, in quality, only so-so (I got better results, including better sound and deeper color, by DVD-recording off of Turner Classic Movies), but it does carry English subtitles, though laughingly attenuated. If this is your only access to Peter Ustinov as a bearded Nero and sylphid Deborah Kerr as the willowy damsel Lygia under chase by the black bull, then you can't do much worse than buy this copy. The original movie was pre-Cinema Scope so the ratio is 1:1.33 and you're not missing anything, widescreen-wise. Call it the poor man's tour of ancient Rome: fire, circuses, crucifixions, and all -- the stuff that makes your TV screen pant and sweat and earn its wattage."
1,Bootleg?,The very old VHS copy I still have somewhere has better graphics than the BD version I purchased. The picture of the VHS is very clear throughout while that of the BD is mostly dark & thick-- no matter how I much adjust the settings. A very good movie overall but either I got a bootleg or it was an all-around poorly remastered edition.
4,"For a movie this old, bluray quality is very good","Nice movie. Nice video quality. Don't expect awesome HD audio though. This movie is more talk and less action. Like Ben Hur, 10 Commandments, etc."
5,Very nice movie quality,"I saw it many years ago, but with this remastered DVD, the movie have a spectacular quality. I recomend it."
4,"Outstanding Film, Poor DVD Quality","Quo Vadis is one of the best films of the 1950s and arguably among the greatest released to date. The verbal sparring among Petronius (Leo Glenn), Nero (Peter Ustinov) and Tigellinus (Ralph Truman) would by itself be the backbone of a great movie. Unfortunately, the world currently lacks a quality copy of the film available to the general public. The Korean copy has several problems with loosing audio sync.If you would like to see this film on DVD, go to TCM and vote for it here:http://www.tcmdb.com/search.jsp?methodName=allSearch&keyword;=quo+vadis"
4,VERY ENTERTAINING EPIC!!!,I love this movie but I will not buy this on VHS. Why isn't it available on DVD? This movie deserves to be released on DVD - there is no excuse. What's the problem? PLEASE RELEASE THIS MOVIE ON DVD!!!
5,Quo Vadis,"I loved it. It was very entertaining ,very emotional , uplifting I would recommend this film to the masses. Great"
3,Great Film But the Dvd is a Rip-Off,"Quo Vadis is one of those large scale biblical epics that has withstoodthe test of time. and as they did with special edition dvds of Ryan'sDaughter, Dr. Zhivago, Mutiny on the Bounty, Grand Prix, Ben-Hur and HowThe West Was Won Warner Brothers Home Video has done a splendid job ofrestoring and remastering the film. but why the break??? a 2hr.52min.filmcan easily fit on one side of one disc."
1,Does not play,I purchased this DVD along with several others. Just a few days ago I was able to view it . IT DOES NOT PLAY COMPLETELY. While all the others do. I would like to return the defective item. Thank you.
4,"Fun, splashy epic","Meanwhile, what does ""Quo Vadis"" mean? I went to a translation site and they don't do Latin.This one is a lot of fun, a little uneven as the first part is rather talky and stagy. The sexual politics between Taylor and Kerr are hilariously dated, and their relationship was never very believable to me. But no matter -- it's always sumptuous to look at.Ustinov goes over the top, comes out on the other side, finds some more scenery to chew there, goes back for seconds, spits it out and then comes back for more. Bravo!Leo Genn is a terrific ""yes-man."" Taylor is more of a movie star than an actor, which is okay given the epic nature of this picture.Second half of picture builds to a series of fantastic set-pieces which make the whole thing well worth the wait.Not as high a quality film as ""Ben Hur"" which is still the gold standard in this genre, but a real treat and one I'm shamed to admit I was ignorant of for so long."
1,Left me in the lurch,"I purchased this DVD to show to a small group. When I tested the DVD, it would not play. Wound up calling Blockbuster (they didn't have it) and finally located a public library that had it. Lot of time wasted - and a more wary man in the future..."
5,Quo Vadis,"I first saw Quo Vadis when it came out in the early 1950s. It was a sensation then and continues to be so today. The cast are all excellent, and Peter Ustinov as Nero is the best ever actor to play the part. Although the film was made before wide screen, cinemascope, or any of the newer techniques, it is the story that is so well developed that pleases. Apart from the history, the film has a strong cast, director, photographer, set designer, and costumer all of whom contribute to a first class movie experience. In other words, ""They just don't make them like this anymore"".It should be included in any serious movie buff's collection."
2,poorly set up,"This edition is very badly set up. The scene index is uselss, and the whole thing is badly done. The VHS of this was great. The story lines are good and the acting is very good. The Amphitheater scenes are very moving. If you can get another copy that is not this one, it would be worth it to see this classic film"
5,Classic Hollywood Epic,"While it shows it's age (some primitive blue-screen effects in particular) this is a wonderful example of what the Hollywood studio system was capable of in the 50s. Lush and colorful with some surprising touches of historical accuracy not normally associated with Hollywood of the era (graffiti in the city of Rome) this is a moving and entertaining film. Star Robert Taylor seems somewhat out of place with his flat, contemporary line delivery early in the story, but he steps up his game when the drama calls for it. The star of the show though is Peter Ustinov who is mesmerizing as Nero. His brilliant performance is enough to recommend this movie. Technically, the film could stand some of Warner's Ultra Resolution magic, but all in all it is a glorious and beautiful high def transfer of a milestone film."
5,QUO VADIS,"THE MOVIE IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE BLU-RAY ADDED THE FINAL TOUCHES TO CONFIRM THIS STORY AS THE MILE-STONE THAT IT IS. IF YOU WANT TO REALLY BE ENTERTAINED WTIH A MOVIE THAT HAS SUBSTANCE, AND NOT JUST FLUFF, QUO VADIS RATES UP THERE WITH BEN-HUR, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, AND A.D. AS EPICS-ESPECIALLY WITH BLUE-RAY COLORS!"
4,Excellent Epic,"I gave it 4 stars because of historical inaccuracy and sometimes cheesy acting. That said, the costumes and set (actually filmed in Rome) was superb. The Roman triumph and music also superb. Although a Catholic film, for all intents and purposes based upon the novel from a Nobel winning Catholic (surprise), it was a good story about good, evil, redemption and sacrifice. Meaning, all ages can learn from it and come away with possibly some personal growth.BTW, Peter Ustinov played a perfect psychopathic coward.I just wish more epics on this scale could be made again."
3,classic collection,Amazon has provided with many classics this is one of them.Not as the best but still rates high
3,Two Great Performances,"In addition to the outrageously wonderful performance of Peter Ustinov as Nero in this film, there is the smoldering and lascivious Patricia Laffan (spelling?) who plays his wife, Poppaea. This movie is worth buying just to watch these two. I particularly remember Poppaea lolling about with a cheetah or leopard or tiger on a chain, uttering insolent remarks and casting lustful glances at Marcus Vinicius (Robert Taylor). There is much spectacle and wonderful sets."
3,Quo Vadis,This movie has always been a greact one. However I'm a little sick and tired of having to jump around to get to ENGLISH. It seems to me that these movies should be made in English format and NOT from some other country. Therefore if you do not have the tools at hand to change fom one foremat to the other I would suggest REFRAINING from buying this movie.
4,Very Good movie about Ancient Rome and early Christians,I recently purchased the video Quo Vadis and watched it twice. I enjoyed it very much. It is a good movie from the 1950's and it protrayed the sufferings of early Christians under Nero. It is too bad that Hollywood doesn't make films like this anymore.It would be nice to have this film put on DVD.
5,A Great Epic!,"This is one of the greatest movies of all time. Filmed in Rome, it is full of terrific acting, music, sets, and direction."
2,Overlong 1951 epic. Worth seeing for Peter Ustinov,Spectacular sets. Peter Ustinov steals movies as Nero. Leo Genn always the finest supporting actor. Robert Taylor is wooden as usual. Deborah Kerr just stands around looking prettily made up. Almost 3 hour film is just too long. Contents do not justify it's length. Worth seeing once.
5,dvd,"Delivery was excellent, in fact it was early. The DVD of Quo Vadis was exactly as described and excellent quality for a film made over 40 yrs ago. Always satisfied with amazon, their delivery, products and customer service are outstanding."
1,Very superficial,"I've only recently begun investigating ADD and still I foundthis video to be extremely superficial and hardly worth the price. I can't see that it would be useful for anyone since the profiles are so brief and do not give the viewer any sense of what ADD looks and feels like. My advice would be ""to save your money"". I regret that I spent mine. END"
2,Falls short...,"I was hoping that this was a starting point for information about real people with ADD and to gain some insight into what I suspect is ""ailing"" my 19 year old son. This video doesn't go far enough for the price. I was very disappointed with it."
5,"""Must"" viewing for ADD sufferers and their families.","Hosted and narrated by Mariette Hartley who herself suffers from ADD, Outside In: A Look At Adults With Attention Deficit Disorder profiles an insidious and hidden disorder that over 12 million adult Americans suffer from. Leading experts in the filed of ADD comment on treatment options, new research finds, and the importance of getting an accurate diagnosis. Outside In presents sensitive and compelling interviews with adults who suffer from the disorder. They share their personal journeys and the strategies they use to succeed. Outside In is highly recommended viewing for any adult who must deal with the condition of ADD, or who has a loved one who does."
5,An Excellent Read For Customer-Centric Managers,"This book is a must-read for any professional services executive who is serious about winning and keeping customers.Lots of good ideas on how to reach out to your clients more effectively, ideas which force you to think about how you are treating your own clients!Well-punctuated with case studies. Look forward to Dawson's next book.."
2,Dry as a bone,"This book reads like a dull sociology treatise. It is hard to argue with most of the points, but much of what is stated is obvious. Dawson is heavy on theory, but light on example and ways to apply the theory. A book this hard to read (i.e., dull) should at least deliver a great deal of wisdom. It doesn't. Contrasted with a lively and example-filled book like Thomas Stewart's ""Intellectual Capital"", Dawson's work doesn't make the grade."

1,I don't like llama sausage,"If I could have given a zero-star review for this book, I would have. This is dreck on the level of Newt Gingrich's ""1945"". Mr. Burgauer should hire a good copy editor, at the very least. At the most, he should stick to his business books."
1,1 star for thr llama sausage,"Congratulations Mr. Burgauer, you just got the first one star review I've ever given! Thank you for the excellent recipe for llama sausage given in such exhausting detail mid-book! Thank you for revealing, showing, and writing down the contents of your thesaures at every chance, opportunity, or possibility! Thank you for so clearly illustrating the endless literary uses of the generally underused exclamation point! Thank you for the multitude of sex scenes in which portions of the female anatomy are proved to not only have independant motion, but apparently minds of their own! Think of the endless fun I've been missing by not knowing such little tidbits about my own anatomy!In all seriousness, the plot might be interesting, but it's not worth the endless dreck."
5,will change your life - and your kid's!!,"This is a GREAT product - everyone i know has one and loves it for their kids! my kids are 4 and 3 and it boosted their confidence level in the water tremendously! it comes recommended by both lifegaurds and swim teachers...you can even (secretly) take out floats inside it as your child progresses. no more having your child cling to you or worrying that at any minute they will go under! in fact, this is the only floating device our town pools allow!"
5,AWESOME PRODUCT,This is a great product for kids learning to swim. I feel it is better than the blow-up arm bands. My son used it for 2 years and it held up wonderfully.
3,Be Aware,"This runs small, especially if you have a taller child. The size specifications they give indicated that my daughter would use the medium. When I got it, it was too small and did not come to her chest. I have not used it, so this is the only rating I can give"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VEST,"I bought this vest for my son, who will be three in two months. I have put it on him two times and each time, he goes face down into the water. Luckily I was right there and was able to pull him up quickly. Had I not been standing there, my child absolutely would have drowned. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Period!"
5,Every child should have this!,"I can not tell you how wonderful this product is. It is easy and comfortable to put on: My 3 year old can take it on and off herself. It builds water confidence without building carelessness. Within a day or two in the pool, she had stopped clinging to me and started swimming. By the end of the summer, we had removed several layers of flotation. And best of all, I had confidence in her and didn't hover (well, not too much, anyway). Well worth the money!!!!!"
2,This product cut my child's legs,"I know many have had great experiences with this product. We didn't have the opportunity to have such great success. The clip between my daughter's legs chafed the inside of her thighs terribly. They are extremely raw and red. I'm returning it to the store. I had the proper size for my daughter, so fit isn't the issue."
5,Confidence in one wear!,"We bought this for my 4 year old daughter after seeing a neighbor's 3 year old with the younger version. Before this trainer, she would attach herself to me or her dad in the pool and not let go. The first day we put the trainer on her, she was hesitant at first, but after 30 minutes she was telling us to let go of her and that she could ""do it by myself"". The next day in the pool, she jumped right in and started moving around. Due to all of the pads still being in the trainer, she isn't ""swimming"" but she is definitely 100% comfortable and able to move around the pool with no help from us. It has been an amazing change!"
4,Effective for New swimmers,"This vest was the one recommended by the first ever swim class as a next step tool for learning. It has elastic adjustable straps on the side which allow most fits. Our child stepped right in and the crock strap was easily adjusted. We haven't pulled any of the pads out yet but she ways 33 lbs and the pads offer just a slight negative boyancy so she has to kick to stay up when mom or dad is not holding her (a good thing to learn). Within 30 minutes of wearing the vest she was comfortable with kick and moving her arms in the next step for swimming. This is a tool to learn to swim. It is not a life vest and should not be purchased if thats what you are looking for. Only negative we have had is as she jumps up and off the side, the vest tends to ride up and the croch strap get tight. Thats it. Great swimming aid."
1,Strap causes extreme chafing,"I purchased this for my 4 year old son for a trip to Jamaica. He's still learning to swim, and I thought this would be a less bulky alternative than his regular swim vest. At the end of the first day, he was in tears and the inside of his poor little legs were raw from the chafing. He was in so much pain that I couldn't even put any cream on them. The instructions indicated that if it is worn properly that the strap should remain loose when in the water. I think that is probably true, but the thickness of the strap (about 4 inches) would cause rubbing even if it wasn't pulled snugly to his body. We didn't bother packing it back up for the trip home, because I know he won't be wearing it again. A week later and there is still some redness on this thighs."
5,Incredible difference,This swim system made an incredible difference in how my son would preform at the pool. We went from being scared to death and hanging on to me for dear life to jumping off the side of the pool and submerging his head under water. And having a wonderful time while doing it! This has given him such confidence and security to really play and have a great time.
1,I LOVE vampire movies - I fell ASLEEP during this one....,"It has a ""home movie"" feel, which I normally like - however, ""Habit"" completely drags on in almost every scene. I normally agree with the consensus of reviewers, but this movie was just painfully slow. I did not find the movie scary, creepy, intelligent or ""B movie"" campy in any way..... Have some fun and re-watch Bram Stokers Dracula - no comparison!"
1,It'll Drain You...,"It's strange that I should find myself, a fan of independent film and the use of the medium, someone with an interest in the subject matter of this movie, absolutely hating it. I am completely unable to understand how anyone could survive this film. There is no action...there is no ANYTHING. If it is believable, it is only due to the fact that the film moves at the same pace and feels about the same way as the most boring day of your life. Maybe I was missing something, but be aware that not everyone loved this movie...It may be a waste of your time...it was most certainly a waste of mine."
2,Fessenden's interesting vampire film goes dead,"I was expecting a couple of things from this movie. For 1 I was thinking Fessenden should do something about that gap tooth and put some gel in his hair and 2, it would be creepy as hell, but it wasnt. It had some parts in it that were eery but the movie becomes boring as it goes and it only survives because of the final showdown and Fessenden's strong performance. Starring Meredith Shaider, Aaron Rell, Patricia Coleman, Jesse Hartman, Heather Woodbury and Larry's father Hart Fessenden, who in this movie plays his father, hmm, what a coinceidence. That scene where Fessenden was running in the boat naked shouldnt of been him naked, it should of been him in clothes. The dead cat was a shocker scene and that's when it starts to become good. So-so on a planetary level."
1,?,"The acting was horrible and the characters unlikable, they spent most of the time talking using big words and saying nothing, don't waste your time"
4,SOLID INDY PSYCHODRAMA!!!,"Captivating! That's the best word I can come up with to describe Larry Fessenden's HABIT. Yes, it does have a somewhat slow beginning and middle. Yes, the director should've cut 20 minutes out to speed things along... But you know what, it works anyway. Because regardless of the slow pace, I found myself GLUED TO THE FILM. Hence, the word: 'captivating.' Fessenden succeeds in giving the streets of New York City a certain 'gothic' feel while his actors excel on all fronts. My favorite character, besides them all, is Lenny - you gotta love'em. ""On the f*%$in poop deck, man!"" More impressive... HABIT comes across as a beautiful, dark, poem - very much in the tradition of Edgar Allen Poe. I highly recommend this intelligent film!"
2,For people who don't really want to know much,"I love watching football, and was hoping to learn more about the function/strategy of the different positions. Unfortunately, this little book barely scratches the surface and the writing style was a bit too cute. People who don't like watching football, or don't really want to know much about the game, might like this book. I was done reading it in about 10 minutes and will now donate it to our local school."
1,A Great Dissappointment,"The ""Book Description"" in the Amazon.com webpage is a gross overstatement. At most, 10 pages of the book are dedicated to an extremely brief address of how to convert or translate a Fortran 90 program to C++, which falls so far short of what is required that words fail me. Fortunately, I can return the book to source with refund. It does not deserve even a 1 star rating."
1,Very poorly written ... very few examples,This book was a complete waste of money. I'm lucky that I was able to return the book for a full refund. THe book is just poorly written with very few examples. Not worth your time.
3,Good book but costly,I was looking for such book five years ago. Now the graphics came down to earth with so many way and computer languages.I want to congradualte the author for such thought and work. It still useful for many old and old people.
3,So-so,"OK, but if this was William S. Burroughs' favorite book, he must not have been much of a reader. At least if I decide to break into a house, I know to put my shoes into my back pockets."
3,"You can't win, complete and unabridged",I really enjoyed this book. It painted a very good picture of how the criminal life was back at the turn of the century.
4,Contents of the music CD.,"Includes a very good music CD (34 min. 27 sec.) (All music, no commentary). CONTENTS: I'm your hoochie coochie man / Muddy Waters -- Juke / Little Walter -- Sweet little angel (live version) / B.B. King -- Killing floor / Howlin' Wolf -- First time I met the blues / Buddy Guy -- Frosty / Albert Collins -- I pity the fool / Boddy Bland -- Okie dokie stomp / Clarence `Gatemouth' Brown -- Rooster Blues / Lightnin' Slim -- Walkin' the boogie (alternate take) / John Lee Hooker -- I'm wild about you baby / Lightnin' Hopkins -- Let the good times roll / Louis Jordan & his Tympany Five."
2,Disappointed,"I have just finished reading the book, and while it does offer a lot of good information, I think it tends to be biased and incomplete. Many of the finest blues pioneers were either omitted completely, or given one mention in a sentence about somebody else. No blues history is near complete without in-depth mention of Reverend Gary Davis, Mississippi John Hurt, Pink Anderson, and others. There is not a fence around art. There is more to blues than electric guitars and feedback. And by the way, I would argue with the point that the banjo was played in blues before the guitar- though I am not dissing the banjo at all. It's just that the modern banjo is a comparatively recent instrument. I think if someone wants to learn blues history, go to the very good PBS documentaries first. And listen to everybody!"
4,Great Teaching Tool,"This is a wonderful book for people that want to learn about the Blues. You just can't go wrong with Lonnie Brooks.The history part is very good and informative. The listed musicians are wonderful. Good research went into this book.The accompanying CD is pretty good. You can only put so much music on a CD. It must have been a difficult task deciding what songs to include on the CD.Understand that this work is not complete. There are many musicians and songs that are not listed that should be, however, the attempt to introduce the Blues to the reader is pretty good. Enjoy it."
2,Wrong CD track info......or wrong track?,"This book is ok...not great....but ok for someone who is wants to cut their teeth on the blues. The main problem I have, is with the CD. Overall it's excellent except for one problem. The 10th track is listed on page 349 as Walkin' the Boogie(alternate take) by John Lee Hooker. After listening to the CD I realized they're dead wrong. The recording is Willie Dixon doing Walking the Blues. Two totally different songs with a similar name. I contacted the publisher about this omission but have not received a response or acknowledgement to date. It is a shame....because both of these artists have made significant contributions to the blues and to confuse them, seems to suggest that not enough care was taken when this book was first published."
3,"A Documentary, NOT a teaching manual...","Though this is an interesting book, if you are used to the 'Dummies' series and think it will be a manual to teach you how to play the blues guitar, you will be dissapointed."
2,"Good book ,could be better!","I enjoyed reading this book .I especially enjoyed the accompaning CD.I think it was a compehensive book about the Blues.My concern is that it failed to convey the love of music,the distinguised authors obviously have.It has a who is who chapter which I belive is comphensive but still It reads like,for lack of a better description,a phone book.I have listened to performers performing on a stage tell their own stories or events in Blues music that are fascinating and that just stick in ones mind.And soul and flavor of the music just comes through.Ofcourse performing is not the exactly writing."
2,Wrong Color,This candle is a light purple; a lavendar. None of the photographed candles are this color. I was expecting the blue and was greatly disappointed.
1,Leaky Mess,This is a Wal-Mart brand candle that does heat up the wax from end to end and then it spills hot wax all over your table. I thought it was a mistake the first time but it did it again. I had to throw the candle away before it permanently damaged something.It would have been cheaper to go to Wal-Mart to purchase this candle had I known that this was a Wal-Mart brand.
2,They look good to start with,"These ventshades looked good when I put them on. They did the job they were suppoed to do, but within a couple years some of the tape came off the plastic and they began flopping(eventually flying off as I drove down the road). After 3 & 1/2 years the plastic became brittle and is disintigrating on my car. The tape is still stuck where the shade was and looks like crap :( They work well for the short term, but if you are wanting them for a long term vehicle I would avoid these particular ones."
5,NOLS Cookery,"I was introduced to an earlier edition of this book on my NOLSInstructors Course. The food we learned to prepare on the course wasTHE BEST I've ever eaten. NOLS has elevated food selection, storage and preparation to a science. This new edition is MUCH better than the old, with more great information about ration planning, equipment selection, cooking information and some NEW, TASTY recipes. Due to the use of bulk rations, the NOLS style of cooking may not be appropriate for occasional hikers going only for a weekend, but is a superb system for meal planning for longer trips. Anyone can become a GREAT backcountry chef with this guide! END"
5,Don't try this at home kids...,This is an essential book for anyone planning extended backcountry trips (more than a few days). It tells you what and how much to bring as well as what to do with it when you're hungry. I was introduced to this book on my NOLS Alaska Backpacking course and was treated to some of the best food I had ever tasted (or so I thought). Once you get back to the real world you realize that instant refried beans and lentils just aren't very good. ;-)
4,A classic...,"One of the best of the many How-to-cook-in-the-backcountry books. Might as well buy a good digital kitchen scales along with the book since the so-called ""NOLS System"" is primarily weight based. I give it four stars because of it's claims regarding NOLS invention of the system (which worked great for the Greeks 2K years before Petzolt and his ilk laid claim to it). Next thing you know they're going to claim they invented wilderness First Aid.Oh wait! They already did:Nols Wilderness First Aid (Nols Library):)"
1,Good Cookbook But Not For Backcountry,"Claudia's book uses NOLS techniques to cook in the backcountry. However NOLS is promoted by Backpacking Light Magazine staff who in turn teach ultralight backpacking techniques. The paradox is that in her book Claudia's cookery involves carrying a heavy pantryload of ingredients most of which do not have the desired nutritional/energy calorie ratio required of backpacking. On short hikes her methods might work but for my purposes (ie JMT,LT,AT) buying her book was a waste of money."
3,Good mathematical E&M book,"I used this book for a couple of my graduate level E&M; classes. This book seems to be a good foundation for learning the theoretical in's and out's of E&M.; That being said, it is great for graduate students and professors but not so great for real engineers.Now that I am a Systems (RF) Engineer, I have not found this book all that useful as a reference, simply because I have to go through tons of math just to get the answer I need. It is definitely not a ""quick reference"" book for the practicing engineer, but rather a in depth mathematical look into E&M; theory."
4,This is a graduate level book,"Being a doctoral student in electrical engineering and having a B.S. in physics, I would say this is definitly a graduate level text. The reader must have a strong background in math, being able use formulas such as Legendre polynomials and vector cal with full understanding. It helps to have been exposed to this material. If you are looking for a book with more broken down explainations and examples, I would suggest Intro to Electrodynamics by David Griffiths."
1,Poorly Written and almost no examples...,"I'm no genius in RF Engineering but I have come across a lot of good Microwave Engineering books and this is NOT one of them. More to the point, I work entirely with other RF engineers and every person I showed this book to shuddered and began spouting off profanities at it.Although the book does start out simply enough, the chapters tend to give only a brief overview of the material. The real trouble starts when you try to work the problems at the end of each chapter. With no solid examples or clear explanations of how to proceed, I found myself referring to my other RF textbooks for support.I have no doubt that if you are borderline Genius, this book will make perfect sense to you. ...But for us less than genius personality types, keep looking, your book is still out there."
3,More so for children,"The toe ring is pretty, but a stone fell out the day I took it out of the box. I had to super glue it back on. It wears fine, except it turns often, but what toe ring doesn't. This item would look cute as a button on a little girl."
1,"""you get what you pay for""","I just loved this adorable bejewled butterfly toe ring when I saw it online! I'll confess that I wondered how many times I could wear it before one of the little ""blue crystals"" would fall off, but I did NOT expect it to ARRIVE with only 3 of the 4 small sparklies intact. There's a lot of cute, very inexpensive costume-jewelry out there. This, unfortunately, not only looks cheap, but is made with substandard materials."
3,Just OK,"I purchased this book to read on holiday as i wanted to get an overview of a subject which has always intrigued me but about which i know very little. Having read the book cover to cover (it can also be ""dipped"" in to by reading specific chapters of interest) i guess i have learnt a bit more but am way off being an armchair psychologist!I liked his writing style. It felt like the author was chatting to me over coffee and digestive biscuits and he illustrates his points well with examples in many places.However, I felt he went a bit off topic on several occasions and it was more like biology for dummies. My other criticism is that the book is very poorly indexed and seems to jump all over the place with many strange subject headings and indexes.As many other reviewers have pointed out, the lack of footnotes or comprehensive bibliography.references is a serious flaw."
4,Great!,I got this book in the mail a couple days ago. I have only read the first few chapters so far but it has been very informative and helpful since I started. I have learned what different psychologists do and I hope to learn a lot more as I keep reading.
3,Good first look at psychology,"Gives one the overall view of psychology that you will get in college from Psychology 101, 102, 103"
2,Not for those who want a basic understanding,"I recently took a psychology class, unfortunely my teacher has a PHD and uses nothing but big humongous words. I purchased this book because I've purchased other Dummy books thinking I would get a simpler or even exciting understanding. I like psychology but not everyone is an effective communicater/teacher. This book was no better, I was expecting the writer to make it fun & easier for those who want to learn the subject. I found it completely a waste of time and over my head. I'm a B+ student and I was frustrated alot with the meanings or interpretations given...after scratching my head, I checked out the book cover and low & behold ...the writer also has a PHD -- enuff said. If you already know psychology then go ahead it purchase it, but if you're someone who needs a good understand and need someone to KISS (keep it simple, stupid) keep your money in your pocket. It's a great book but not my cup of tea."
2,No footnotes for a plethora of references,"I found this book to be dry, superficial, and boring. The attempts at humor mentioned by other reviewers do not cut it. It ranges unevenly from being too technical in some areas to too general in others. However, my biggest complaint is that the author makes numerous references such as ""research says...""and ""according to..."" but there are no footnotes or bibliography for follow up. No works are cited, just names of psychologists."
3,Boooooooooooooooooooring,I love psychology and I actually read this book cover to cover in hopes it would get better as it went along. It's very superficial and technical and therefore boring. No practical help in my job (the reason I bought it).
5,here's the background story folks,"I am a huge fan of Frank McCourt's books (Angela's Ashes, 'Tis, and Teacher Man) and this film actually goes into greater detail regarding the family dynamic. Not only between the brothers and their mother, but also the personal struggles each one encountered and how they overcame. I absolutely loved this DVD!"
3,Want to know more about the McCourts?,This video gives you more info about the McCourts...but you have to be a true fan to enjoy it.
2,very disappointing,"Because of its glowing reviews and my strong interest in learning more about Edinburgh and Scotland, I had high expectations for this book. I was very disappointed. It assumes that the reader has a strong knowledge of Scottish history, so the neophyte will not learn much. Yet, the book is written at such a superficial level that a knowledgeable person will learn nothing new. As another Amazon reviewer points out, the book is essentially themeless and has no point of view. I know that the book received many positive reviews, but it is difficult to know what audience will get much out of it. I havn't been this disappointed in a book for a long time."
3,"Lots of Info, No Theme","This treatise is well-researched and chock-full of historical facts about an interesting period. But I often asked myself where Buchan was going with it all. There seemed no theme, except the simplest ""Edinburgh was an interesting place then"" or very narrow theses at best.Also, the editing is sloppy. Paragraphs are misplaced, and there are occasional errors in spelling or grammar. Antecedents are missing or lost.Another draft might have made for an excellent book."
1,New product purchased but USED product delivered,"This product came already opened with a sloppy re-taping job by someone prior to shipping. It came without mounting instructions so trying to figure out how to attach it to a metal from bumper has been difficult at best. It is useless to me at this point but since it was obviously used before being sent to me, returning it for a refund is not an option."
3,OK,"This is a little more flimsy than I was hoping for. I like the quality of the material used, I just do not like the cardboard, or whatever is used for the structure of the bins. I have to carry with 2 hands otherwise the boxes bend and my items fall right out. I would also like a place for a label like a couple of other bins I have. I use this for my clean laundry and label them with each person's name so my other bins have nice labels I've put in their label slots, and these just have them taped on the side. I guess that part was my fault since it does not say anything about slots on the description. Just a couple of things I will look for next time in looking for starage bins."
4,great neutral addition to living room,"We store toys in two of these bins under our television unit. The internal wall boards do begin to bend a little over time, but that's with quite a bit of abuse dragging blocks in and out of them, and with a toddler trying to use it as an anchor to stand up with. I'm sure that's not the original intent of these bins, but it goes to show how sturdy they are given the circumstances. I like that there is a separate internal base to give some 'beef' to the bottom, rather than just being floppy like some bins."
4,no lid,"for some reason, i thought this box was gonna have a lid on it too, but no. It came here fast and it fits all my knitting. It looks sturdy enough, I was just a tad disappointed to find out there's no lid to this."
1,Does not stand up,"Wanted a nice natural box to store my wedding dress. The box looks nice, the material is good, but it does not stand up on its own! Returned."
5,Durable and streamlined storage bin !,"An excellent, durable product. They fit the IKEA Expedit for our daughter's room perfectly. We also use them in our laundry room to hold our shelved cleaning products (away from toddler hands). Great product !"
5,nice storage bin,"Simple product, good price, works well. I use this to store my extra toiletries (shampoo, body wash, toothpaste, etc.) since I tend to buy in bulk from warehouse stores. The storage bin is pretty sturdy and the color matches my home decor well. I am satisfied with this product."
5,TR63 only buy from Amazon,"Amazon offered the TR63 at $296 with $10 shipping. You've got to catch their sale. Office Tech and just about every other merchant will charge exorbitant shipping. The kit requires assembly and is very well constructed. It does match the Samsung DLP TVs very well. Also Samsung will be coming out with new models in June, so these stands may get cheaper."
2,Good product... But...!!!,"Nice TV stand for the Samsung 61"" TV we purchased. However, I have seen them on other web sites for wayyyyy less money than what we paid at Best Buy. You shouldn't pay more than $100.00 for the stand. Unfortunately, we did. Than we purchased a wood stand that looks much better for our decor and moved this one into our bedroom. Still a nice stand but pricey."
5,Love This Company!,"This stand is beautifully designed and is a must for your Samsung. Had a customer service issue with this company and they responded so quickly, professionally and above and beyond what you would expect."
5,Great game for years to come.,"This game, along with the 2 EA patches make the game worth getting. You can also download ALMS and CART mods for the game as well as dozens of new tracks to add to it. Don't listen to the bad reviews, its well worth [the money]. F1 2002 has better graphics and multiplayer, but this game has tons of add-ons. Buy Both!"
2,This book is missing pages.,"Just received my second copy (replacement copy) of ""300 Years of Kitchen Collectibles"" and it also is missing pages 401-432 and has duplicate pages 433-464. That makes two books missing the same pages.Otherwise the book has a lot of information."
4,Better tasting than the Dark Roast pods,"I loved the idea and ease of the Senseo, but I was never that crazy about the way the coffee tasted. The grocery stores do not offer much in the way of variety, so I decided to take a chance and order the Columbia Blend from Amazon. I have been very happy with the flavor of it compared to what I had been getting.If you are up for a change and want a smoother flavor, but still a strong tasting coffee. Give it a try!I will note that the bag only comes with 16 pods vs. 18 in the regular bags."
2,Prefer the Six Pack,Find the Colombian blend too strong these days. More expensive way to purchase in the 4 pack. Will not again buy this blend or amount again
2,Coffee desire,"Ok, I had hopes for this as I really like Columbian coffee. I was very disappointed. It is nasty. Really off taste. i would much prefer Nescafe Classico instant!"
1,Terribly Bitter,"The brand of Senseo that came with my little coffee pod machine was stronger than I liked so I tried a four pack of Columbiacoffee and the first pod was so strong that it upset my stomach. The next two were terrible and I dumped both cups. Since then I have tried diluting each pod with some water but the rotten taste persists. I bought a large coffee at a popular drive in and it was really strong and would have been refused back in the WWII era. NEEDLESS TO SAY, NEVER ANOTHER SENSEO COFFEE POD IN MY HOUSE, EVER AGAIN!I don't blame Amazon for my mistakes but it really irks me to throw out twenty some dollars worth of worthless SENSEO coffee pods. Will keep the pod machine to heat water for tea. My suggestion is for people to buy coffee and filters from your local stores, at least most of it is drinkable and so much cheaper!"
5,Senseo Coffee pods,I love my Senseo latte maker. I usually put a packet of hot chocolate mix into the cup before I brew the latte into it. Delicious!! Mocha Latte every winter morning gets my morning on the right track.
4,great flavor,"COLUMBIAN.BOLD- RICH & DARK.A really good cup of coffee.A great price---subscription discount& free shipping.I also like the Sumatra.Next, Iam going to try Kenya.They say the Kona is only 10% KONAand the rest is Columbian..so I don't thinkI will try that one.I use a 4cup MR COFFEE pot...2 podsfor 4 cups of coffee....You do not have tohave a coffee pod maker to enjoy the pods.I love the pods... no mess and worry free.I have tried the MELITTA Coffee Pods andthey have many great flavors but they areweak and colorless and more expensive.bette b praterokc ok 62OCT 2012--I could never afford this now.NO $$.......NO LONGER subscribe and save.......b"
2,Senseo... but a dying format of coffee pods,"This is a senseo coffee product, but the Colombia Blend does not reflect the coffee perfection attained by the Dutch DOUWE EGBERTS company. While this flavor carries the DOUWE EGBERTS logo, it does not produce the flavor I have come to expect. Weaker flavor. Maybe a ""blend"" means less arrabbica bean content."
5,Mellow Vibes,"Compare them to whoever you want, but listen the them you must. SLightly Stoopid is the band that will be making the punk/ska/regaee style hit the mainstream. If you like acoustic music or just good music in general you need this album."
5,Excellent Music from an underground sound,"Slightly Stoopid, if you've heard of them you know that they are really good. For the other 99.99999% of you who have never heard of Slighly Stoopid, you are missing out on some of the best music that is being released in the post Sublime era. Though SS is not Sublime, I can't come up with a better way of classifying them. Basically, if you like the Long Beach Dub All Stars, you will like Slightly Stoopid. Acoustic Roots is a very chill album, much like the Bradely Nowell and Friends album. Basically, if you enjoy the more acoustic side of Sublime and LBDAS, I gurantee that you will like Slightly Stoopid. (By the way, if you can get your hands on the band called THE EXPENDABLES, you will not be disappointed either!)"
5,More fun than tree full of monkeys!,"With the exception of maybe Jack Johnson, and the late great Sublime, I haven't heard a band that made listening to music so much fun. Slightly Stoopid has a bit of their own thing going on with alot of background influences from other great So-Cal bands. It's a winning combo that really rocks. They have a roots rock style that is broken down to it's finest form on ""Acoustic Roots"". And the other albums rock as well!To the person who has informed us that this album was recorded live on a radio program and then sold -as it was- to the public, you nailed it! That alone says alot. And to all of you who think that this band might take Roots-Rock-Reage to the mainstream. Well all I can say about that is ""I sure hope not!"" I like the fact that -relatively speaking- only a few of us get to enjoy this great sound!"
2,not the best choice,"It's an okay book, but it is spread too thin. The author tries to touch too many topics...not enough antidotes and stories to help one remember all the facts."
2,Southern mysteries,"An okay book. Interesting, but most of the information is what you have heard if you were raised in the south."
5,Absolutely loved this movie...,"I can't believe I waited so long to see this movie, but I am glad that my first viewing was on DVD. The cinematography and sound was among the best of all of the DVD films I have seen."
5,Justin Murphy review flawed.,"I hate to say it but Justin Murphy doesn't know what he's talking about. Glory is a well ballanced epic with excellent acting tallent. It doesn't depict the Southern people as racist, it shows the truth about northern people though, they are and were just as racist even more so than the South. Matt Broadrick and Morgan Freeman got jipped as did the whole movie by the racist Motion Picture Accadamy, I think Broadrick did an awesome depiction of Shaw, certainly close to the man himself as he could have come.Glory is one of the two best Civil War films in Motion Picture History, Gettysburg being the other. It is a must have for educators."
5,Glory,"This portion of our history was greatly told, as well as being kept authentic in clothes, life styles and attitudes."
4,Great movie,A-list actors put together a very awesome film about the Civil War. Shows the true meaning of sacrifice and determination
3,Great Movie,This movie is about the 54th Massachusetts Army and I had to watch it for my paper! Would definitely recommend!
2,review,"Film Review I liked the film although in some parts I thought it was weak and lacked realism. It still was good though in the way the plot was laid out, in the way they went into their first battle and had victory and little casualties. It made the men feel like they were invincible and nothing could beat them. 'Trip' was my favorite character as he 'put his money where his mouth was'. My favorite part was when Trip went to get his pay and when he was told he was only to get 12 pounds instead of 13 pounds he convinced everyone to rip up their pay sheets. When their leaders saw this they then to tore up their pay sheets and would not accept any."
3,"""Come on men, Lets go try to run up that hill, in broad daylight, and lets yell at the South. Its a bulletproof plan!","I thought this movie was pretty good. But the ending took away the whole drama for me. Instead of being anxious, on the edge of my seat, i found myself laughing at those people's stupidity. Its like come on guys its suicide! Well i know people are reading this and saying ""well they had to, its what they did back then"" but there are numbers of things different and smarter they could of done. Before i say this movie i knew all about the civil war and fort wagner. so dont be all up at me. goodbye"
1,Glory,"GloryI had purchased this as the ""edited"" version and it is definitely NOT edited. This DVD is not appropriate for educational purposes."
5,Glory is the best war movie I have ever seen.,"Glory is worth all the five stars. It is an excellant movie maybe even in my top ten of all time. Denzel Washington is in one of his greates roles ever, Matthew B. is excellant."
3,Too many movie cliches spoil the drama,"I wanted to like this movie, but unfortunately the writing/producing just kept ""Glory"" at the level of a standard ""Hallmark Hall of Fame"" family flick. The major problem is that the major characters--who represent the black union soldier in the Civil War--are cut from a 'how to create a character' guide. There's the intellectual, the dork, the realist, and the old timer--all set up to show us the various personalities behind the near-mythic brave men who fought not just a war, but a society, and even their own side. But in doing so, they are never real people--simply types.Now, most everything else about this film is competent, although the dialogue too is a bit contrived, however, it is the IMPORTANCE of making this film when it was made that is its saving grace. So, simply put, it's not a great film, not even a good film, but it is more important in a socio-cultural artifact than most American films are likely to be."
3,this is all-right,"This movie is all-right. IT has a lot of history in it. IF your looking for action this is not the movie for you. If your looking for imformation on the 54th Massuchussets you should rent this movie. I am a big civil war buff but I didn't like this movie that much. If your a buff like me you should rent the movie "" Gettysburg"". It is a long movie with plenty of action. yet,if you've already seen ""gettysburg"" and your looking for somthing to rent just rent ""GLory"". It's o.k."
4,it was a good film but it was a bit boring in some parts,this film had only one good part which was when the mans head was blown off it is such a very large shame that this man was not sean. this upset me because i dont like him and he always farts.
4,History Made Real,"This movie brought to light many aspects of the Civil War, such as the living conditions of the soldiers, that other movies have missed. The version of the movie with commentary by the director and some of the actors is especially interesting."
5,I envy those who have not yet seen this.,"For a plot summary, you can read one of the dozens listed below, all of which are thorough and often exemplary.What I think you need to know is that this relatively small but hugely important event in Civil War history has been brought to the screen with class, detail, enthusiasm and reverence. Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington, together in one film, show why they're among the best actors working today...amongst our best ever.Matthew Broderick is fine as the young colonel. Andre Braugher should be a bigger star...given a chance he could be one of our greats.Script, cinematography, direction, score...the collaborative nature of film is given prime example right here.I envy those who have not yet seen this."
3,Feel Good Vs. Historical Accuracy,"Edward Zwick's approach to the characters and how they evolved throughout the movie enhance the sacrifices they made. This feel good approach makes ""Glory"" a dramatic and entertaining movie. However, the many of the events and the majority of characters in the film were either entirely fictitious or loosely based on actual truth. Roland Emmerich directed ""The Patriot"" in similar fashion. What is amazing is the number of positive reviews ""Glory"" received for its historical accuracy and the number of negative reviews ""The Patriot"" received for its historical inaccuracy. Somewhere in the middle lies the contradiction."
4,Very Good,Enjoyed this film very much. Since I have read more I see where some things are not totally accurate but overall it is an excellent film.
5,Great Film,"This was a great film and deserves 5 stars. My only problem with the movie is that it got a little boring seeing it the 2nd time around. For me that still doesn't take off a star. I saw this movie on VHS and loved, I then rented it on DVD and I thought it was much better in Widescreen. My only complaint is that there are no special features on the disk, the movie still however deserves 5 stars. Anyone who is looking for a great Civil War film, this is what you will want to see."

5,Wonderfully acted and filmed...,"and mostly true, this look at the doomed black soldiers accepted into the Union Army during the waning days of the Civil War shouldn't be missed. Matthew Broderick gives perhaps his best performance, and the supporting cast is stupendous."
3,Overrated,"I like this movie, but come on! More than 250 reviews and only a few less than 5 stars. Its good but not that good. Broderick's preformance is aweful (as his New England accent), its overly melodramatic and shamelessly manipulative, not very historically accurate, too PC, and the battle scenes are too santitized.Again, I like the movie but I just think this movie is overrated.**Note-To the reviewer below-Why is it ""conservative"" to think that the Civil War was not about slavery - I do not consider myself conservative but I am historically literate enough to know that slavery was a primary detail and not the over-reaching cause of the war while many conservatives I know think that the war was only about slavery."
2,Widescreen?,"""Glory"" is one of my favorite films and I expected great things from this ""Special Edition."" It still is a great film and one of the best ever about the Civil War and the introduction of Black troups into that contflict. What I really wanted to see was the black bars at the botton and top of the screen; the true widescreen version. But buyers beware. This is a glorified full screen version (know your screen ratios, folks) and I got burned. Is there a true widescreen version of this film? It deserves a better transfer than this."
3,"Close, But No Cigar","I saw this film twice when it first came out. I have a hard time understanding why the producers don't realize that truth is much more interesting than fiction. Numerous factual problems exist with the film although the teaching points are excellent in many regards. Why the final assault on Battery Wagner is filmed being conducted in the completely wrong direction begs for an explanation. The burning of the town of Darien provides an excellent study in war crimes that I use in lectures today. Good film that could have been much, much better with little effort. It is good entertainment but needs to be augmented with written accounts to learn the actual history."
3,Poignant.,"Glory is a important and sad film about the turblent Civil War and how slaves were treated during that time period. Denzel Washingtion won a best supporting actor Oscar for his brave yet sensitive performance. Matthew Broderick seems out of his league here, he will always be Ferris to me! Morgan Freeman and Cary Elwes also star. Check this highly acclaimed film out some time!"
1,The tape broke at the very end of the movie.,"This is one of my favorite movies, I cry everytime I watch it and could watch it all day staight. I did not like the fact that at the end of the movie the tape snapped. I am not going to complain, I beleive that this is an old film anyway. I just thought you all should know. This will not make me change my feelings about Amazon.com either."
1,Glory Review,"Glory - Film ReviewThis movie starred Denzel Washington as Trip, and Matthew Broderick as Colonel Robert Shaw. It portrayed the African - American involvement in the American Civil War. It follows the 54th Massachusetts regiment, lead by Colonel Robert Shaw. It was based on the books Lay this Laurel and One Gallant Rush, which were based on the letters by Colonel Robert Shaw. I liked the film, as it was not boring and it contained action scenes I would give it about 7/10. One of the scenes was when the black 54th Massachusetts were denied as much pay as the other white soldiers, so the officers in charge of the 54th refused to get pay as well. Another incident was when the regiment went to attack Fort Wagner, a fort of about 1000 men, they failed, Robert Shaw was killed and the fort was never taken."
5,Truly Sensational,"If you haven't already taken the chance to see this CLASSIC, you can now watch it with absolute clarity, both in sound and sight, thanks to the wonderful advancement in technology - DVD's. This movie is by far one of the best war movies ever depicted on the Silver Screen. Its stellar cast (including Academy Award Winning Actor Denzel Washington and Andre Braugher, one of today's most under-rated and under appreciated actors) delivers a truly remarkable performance and made me a fan of a war I shunned as a high school student. To miss this movie is to deprive yourself of, not only an OUTSTANDING movie, but a phenomenal piece of American History very rarely talked about in traditional History classes. This DVD, packed full of extras is one for your home video collection."
4,True Glory,"For once I wholeheartedly agree with the editorial review of this film. The acting is first rate, the action scenes are rich in content and believable, and in the end the whole film is uplifting in spirit if not in the fate of the soldiers. I saw this film when it first came out and it made a solid impression that stuck with me, when I saw it had come out on DVD it reached `must buy' status. I honestly cannot say whether this is an accurate representation history-wise but it sure makes emotional viewing."
4,A Moving Experience,"I am neither a miltary history or Civil War history aficionado, so I'll defer on matters of the film's historical accuracy.But if you're interested in a gripping, moving American war story, beautifully rendered in period costumes and sets, and depicted with outstanding performances, this is it.The story of the Massachusetts 54th reminds me of several historical ""could haves"" that filmmakers enjoy dramatizing. Here, it's the idea that perhaps the experience and sacrifice of soldiers like those in the 54th could have had a salutory impact on race relations immediately after the war. Like I said, perhaps. How this was, at the individual level, the struggle to almost the correct the wrongs done a century before.Anyway.For me, it comes down to this when I saw it in the theater: there wasn't a dry eye in the house when the lights came up. Maybe that says something about the film. Or about us. I hope everyone who decides to watch this is as moved as I was."
5,The Best Civil War Movie Ever AMde,This movie is Historically accuraTE and It greatly entertaining It tells the story of the 54th Volunteer Regiment the first black regiment. It also has a great soundtrack. I would reccomend this movie to any movie goer.
5,Great new edition and extras for best Civil War film of the last quarter century.,"""Glory"" was and still is, both dramatically and visually, the best Civil War film to have been made, in my opinion. On it's release in '89 there was the miniseries ""The Blue and the Gray"" preceding it, but ""Glory"" stood out from that TV melodrama with it's unique story and perspective on the period and it's sense of visual detail which made that war seem as firey and brutal as the Vietnam films we'd seen up to that point. For all the detail of ""Gods and Generals"" and ""Gettysburg"", and the sweep of ""Cold Mountain"", I've still not seen a finer film on the period. This new DVD edition has some great extras which enhance the appreciation of the production and history behind it. If you're an admirer of the film it's well worth the upgrade to this edition."
4,Good educational tool,"I THOUGHT I was buying the educational version of this movie, as that is what I had entered in my search and this came up. I still showed parts to my 7th graders, but had to be vigilant to edit words out."
5,touching,the whole movie is about the first black regiment i believe it is. this is a great movie you will see how long it took them to go to battle with permission. most to every one died. this movie has so much character to it. it is a shame what they went threw. if you like true story's watch this.
5,Great movie a must for any Civil War Fan,"The conversion from dvd to Blu-ray was great and such clarity! The big Actors and some of the ""no namers"" that are huge now show there true acting talent! A must movie for any Civil War fan!"
3,Blu Ray is Disappointing,"This is a magnificent film, with probably one of Horner's best musical scores.However, the Blu Ray version is from a poor master, apparently...there is a ton of grain, mismatched chroma and colors, and even some specks and other noise elements. This should not be expected at this point in the format's life and hence a considerable downgrade."
5,A mixture of emotions wrapped up to make an excellent film!,"Glory is a brilliant film telling the story of the 54th regiment of Massachusetts marching bravely to their death, undawnted by the fact that they will probably never return home again. This is one of the few films where we really expressed our emotions, you just can't help yourself from crying. This is because you know it isn't just a fairytale. It's upsetting how humans can be so prejudice from one another, and how these African-Americans have to fight for equality."
3,"Good movie, not so sure about the casting","I liked this movie, but everytime I heard Matthew Broadrecks squeaky voice, I couldnt help but think of Ferris Bueller. I think some of the roles could have been cast better."
3,"Pleased, with exceptions","The book deals with the wonderful stories of the officers but alas, does not tell the stories of the common men who made up the Company. Would have enjoyed reading more about these soldiers. As always we found the product more than acceptable and the delivery was as usual prompt."
4,memories are made of this,"considering age and eastmancolor was in it's infancy quality good, also released in superscope, the poor man's cinemascope it is held up very well. nice to see it at last in correct ratio. cooper and lancaster are on top form and the rest fit in well. the story was everything i remembered all those years ago and holds the attention. an unsung classic western"
3,slow moving drama,still another movie my mom melane wanted I guess she liked westerns.I wish I would have known this sooner.sorry about that
3,Definitely worth watching!,"A forerunner of ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969), this fifties movie (also filmed in Mexico) even has one of the stars of the latter film in a supporting role--Ernest Borgnine. Gary Cooper is a stalwart, albeit tired-looking hero, but the movie belongs to the athletic, always grinning Burt Lancaster in a great portrayal of a bad guy you can't resist liking--even though you'd never turn your back on him."
3,Burt hams it up and Gary sleepwalks,"I can see where another reviewer considers this the original spaghetti western, but I was disappointed overall. The action sequences were not that exciting, the audio was sometimes muddled and left you guessing what they said (Gary especially). Gary looks old and sleepy throughout the movie. I did enjoy the fact that they showed Gary's confederate soldier as more honorable and brave than Burt's yankee character, but overall Burt's bravado was the only exciting thing about the movie. If you liked this one, get Major Dundee, its only on vhs right now, but it is more realistic and has many of the same themes and it was directed by Sam Peckinpaw (sp?)."
4,Good Western set in Mexico,"I recently received Vera Cruz from my netflix cue. Spent part of my afternoon watching it, and thought it was well worth the time. The movie includes strong leads (Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster), an interesting story, engaging dialog and plenty of action. I particularly liked the end sequence with the battle scene. Plenty of other reviewers cover the general plot and details, so no need for them to repeat them here. The overall quality of the filming is not great which is a shame given that the entire film was shot in Mexico and includes several historical sites.If you enjoy Westerns then you will likely like this one - especially if you like ones with twisting plots. In Vera Cruz it is somewhat hard to tell who is the good guy, until the end."
3,Childhood Revisited,"From virtually the opening scene, this celluloid comic book will take you right back to Saturday afternoons with the smell of popcorn, flying paper cups, noisy things rolling down the aisles and the kid behind with his feet at the back of your head. This is NOT a ""mature"" western. The quick-draw, eagle-eyed feats of shooting have to be seen to be believed (if you're 10 years old), the story line, dialogue, and multi-colored ranks of Mexican federales who serve as targets, all provide an aura around this movie that's guaranteed to take you back to the wide-eyed kid who could barely reach the lady in the booth with his quarter.While I'm searching for more mature westerns these days, I enjoyed this one for its nostalgic value alone. That, and that toothy Lancaster grin that needs its own listing in the credits of this movie."
2,A true disappointment,"Purchasing this DVD was a big mistake.I expected to find some hidden animation treasures (like those found in The International Tournee of Animation tapes). No such luck. Many cartoons in this DVD are quite familiar and can be seen (even more clearly) on the Cartoon Network.This Cartoon Crazys DVD projects a rather blurry image. For instance, the Max Fleischer Superman cartoons included suffer in comparison to the much superior visual quality found in ""The Superman Cartoons of Max & Dave Fleischer"".Sound enhancements are actually annoying and unnecessary. They don't seem to meld seamlessly within the original soundtrack. In my opinion, those extra sound effects, with Dolby and what not, are reminiscent of Ted Turner's infamous obsession of colorizing every black-and-white movie classic.Except for some interesting historical facts and trivia provided, I think there's little to recommend here."
5,I love love,"My daughters favorite cologne , but its not sold in any stores any more and it is hard to find , she was surprised and happy that I was able to get this for her , thanks"
1,"In stock, not in stock? Who knows?","Wasted a day when Sewell canceled my order as ""out of stock"", even though they still show ""2 in stock"".Have no idea how well the product works, but now I know that Sewell doesn't."
5,"An excellent, unusual movie.","Clint Eastwood reaches his summit, both as an actor and a director in White Hunter, Black Heart. A penetrating, highly involved movie, based on facts. Eastwood playnig the lead is a self-centered, megalomaniac movie-director, who sacrifices everything and everybody around him during a trip in Africa, just to fulfill his own ambition to shoot an elephant. His obsessive behaviour leads to ultimate destruction, when at the last moment, he finds himselve unable to shoot, getting his African guide killed in the progress.Eastwood is excellent as the charming, but egoistical director. Jeff Fahey is surprisingly good as his writer friend and the supporting cast, portraying among others real life actors Katherine Hepburne and Humphry Bogard are so realistic it is difficult to believe that they are not really the people they pretend to be. A work of art in every meaning of the word."
1,Clints poorest movie I believe,"No decent plot, and a overall poor film. I love Clint Eastwoods acting, and pretty much all of his movies except this one."
3,A bit boring,The character performed by Clint Eastwood in this movie is a bit too unrealistic and his being so stubborn in trying to prove some point does not make it one of his better movies. The one thing I liked about the movie was seeing Africa which is the most beautiful part of the movie in my opinion.
1,Not Eastwood's Best,This is one of the only Clint Eastwood movies that I do not own. I remember seeing it in the theater and waiting for something to happen. It never happened. This was just plain boring and a major disappointment.
4,A wonderful book !,"This was the first book I'd read by Patricia Gaffney, and I must say, it will not be my last. I truly felt a part of the story and felt that I was a part of the characters' lives. I felt the characters' personality flaws deeply and on a very personal level. I enjoyed ""watching"" the relationships grow and change, just as the characters themselves grew and changed. I felt moved by the flawed, complicated, but deep relationship shared between Rose and Anna.""Flight Lessons"" also had another side effect---it made me want to own my own restaurant ! In all seriousness, this is a lovely book. I look forward to reading more books by this author."
1,What is this one about anyway?,"I did not enjoy this story because I could hardly remember it when I put it down. The characters could have been cardboard figures, the plot is dry, there just is not enough ""oomph"" to get the story off of the ground. The character Anna Catalano is called ""home"" temporarily to help out in the family restaurant. For Anna, home is not a safe haven, but a place of bad memories and disappointments better left buried and sorrows best not come to light. Patricia Gafney, the author, does make an attempt to trhow in some romance, but there just isn't enough there and the story fizzles. There are no ""flight lessons"" unless the author is trying to describe Anna Catalano's flight to and from home, and herself. If you must read this one, get it from the library. To me, it was not worth time, effort, or money."
5,The right Math book.,"This is the Math book I needed, and in the right condition (like new), and the price is better then in a store"
1,never received order,"Since i never received the order i cant rate it ,,,but i do want my money backthank you very much indeed"
3,Plausable explanantions of Greek Mythology,"Warrior in Bronze deals with the life and times of Agamemnon, the king of an ancient Greek city state before and during the time of the Trojan wars. While occasionally tedious, Shipway weaves a good tale of life in ancient Greece as well as offering plausable explanations for a number of figures in the Greek mythos."
4,Durell in Russia,"This is the 3rd of the Sam Durell books. Durell is sent to Russia to stop a renegade general known only as ""Z' from launching WW3. His mission brings him into contact with a group in the underground who are loyal comminuists looking to stop Z.The 50s mix of dedicated American agent working with loyal Communists is a nice switch from the usual red-hatng fiction of the era. Aarons does a good job of maintaining suspense until the end when Z is finally finished and Durell is trapped by the MGB (50s KGB)."
3,2004 East Coast Bigfoot Conference,"This video was very well put together for a conference type format. I feel that conferences could be very interesting or boring but the speakers have powerpoint displays and slide shows which made it interesting. I took this dvd set to work and viewed it during lunch breaks (I viewed one speaker per break). I didn't know what to expect but I can say that I wasn't disappointed with it. The price was a bit high but then again there are 3 dvd's.If your looking for dramatic footage like on tv specials, this is not for you, but if your looking to see about what goes on at these conferences than this is a good representation."
3,Question!,"Please... I'd like to know what song plays in the Gilmore Girls... it's nearly every second episode, and generally when its fast paced, or someone's walking. I can't really ""describe"" the song because it's just a little clip kind of thing. I've checked all the song samples and can't seem to find it! If anyone knows what song I'm talking about, please e-mail me at: wallermelons@yahoo.ca Thank you!! Mel"
1,whats that song,"Im looking for a particular song, the preselected tracks dont necessarily provide you with an opinion of the entire album, listening to the other tracks may change this"
3,Some good tunes...but not what I expected.,"Although the main theme song was on the CD, and the main reason behind the purchase, I was somewhat disappointed by the music that was on the CD. None of these songs stuck out to me as being prominent on the series. Perhaps there could have been more familiar choices."
5,"Great Variety of Music, worth owning","There is truly a great variety of music on this CD. It is worth a listen even if you don't watch the show on TV. Plus this CD has more songs on it than most of the CDs I've seen. Plus great pieces written by the show's creators in the booklet. Has everything from oldies - The Free Design, to ""rock"" - Elastica, and pop - XTC, and then stuff like Black Box Recorder, Bjork, and Yoko Ono. There's a song on this CD for just about every emotion you'll have! Try- Know your onion, Child Psychology, Oh my love, Human Behavior, I'm the man who murdered love, and Girl from Mars."
2,Our Little Corner of the World,"I was disappointed with this purchase. I was looking forward to hearing some of the quirky music from the show,but this is not what I got."
3,Not GG songs...,"There are 3 songs that are really GG songs... I mean the ""Where you lead"" one and the ""na na na na""... ones... But the others are not GG songs... This item made me feel that I'm not such a good fan of GG because I didn't matched the songs with the moments that they are played in the serial... Anyway I liked them because they really are the kind of music that GG listen... and I like to play it again and again... one of the songs doesn't listen very well in my CD...In fact I think it would be much better to have the songs of the man with the guitar in the village... that's the real GG music in my oppinion. But that songs aren't in that CD."
1,Terrible mix,I don't remember any of these songs being played on the show and it's definitely NOT what I would picture the two main characters listening to. Unsatisfied!
2,itune the song(s) you want,"This CD is terrible! I love the show and the true ""Lorelai"" and ""Rory"" music, I don't care how many episodes I have seen and how many times, this is not ""Gilmore Girls"" music other than Where you Lead I will Follow. My husband bought this for me after buying me season 8 to top off my collection thinking I would enjoy the reminder to download to my ipod. This is terrible, I recommend if you want a song, just download from itunes...the CD is not worth the nickel CD it is printed on."
4,This CD Rocks,If you are a fan of the show you've got to have the soundtrack. The songs are great. This CD is so worth the buy.
4,Music Quirky As Expected,My daughter and I love The Gilmore Girls and the quirky music that is played. The CD was exactly as we expected. We would buy it again.
3,Our Little Corner of the World: Music from GILMORE GIRLS,"Not exactly what I thought it would be. Don't recognise many songs or tunes from the shows, except the opening one. Avid Gilmore Girl fan so I'm not sure where this music is from. But, it it catching."
4,Gilmore Girls CD,Great CD from my favorite TV show. The songs are a little different. Not really what I was expecting but I would recommend it.
3,Gilmore Girls the Soundtrack,"Gilmore Girls the Soundtrack simply cannot be put onto one CD. This is a good album, but if your looking to find those hidden gems in every episode you should download them individually. Some of my favorites on this album are ""Child Pshycology""-Black Box Recorder, ""Oh My Love""-John Lennon, of course the intro song ""Where You Lead"", ""Know Your Onion"" The Shins, and ""Girl From Mars""-Ash. Overall good stuff, but you may be disappointed."
5,"If you love the Gilmore Girls, you'll love the soundtrack","My name is Paige and I am 15 and I loved this CD. I loved the soundtrack, I got a lot of use out of it and I could listen to all day. Don't burn it, buy it, the cover and inside stuff you can't get when you burn it. It's a great CD. If you are as huge of a Gilmore Girls fan as I am, than you'll love the CD as much as I do."
3,Gilmore Girls Soundtrack,"The cd is OK.......not great, but then I didn't seem to remember such loud music in the series.....I think I expected more of the troubadour and Carol King."
3,Our Little Corner of the World: Music From Gilmore Girls,"The CD provides the themes heard on Gilmore Girls and that is interesting. However, I was looking for something more such as music referred to by Lorelai, Rory and Lane. As an example, it might have had ""Shadow Dancing"". It is not a CD I would RIP to a hard drive for inclusion with an evening of music. I would have a hard time playing the CD more than the three times I have played it."
5,gilmore girls cd,I love Gilmore girls and I love music so this puts together 2 things I love in one thing. I give it 5 stars for perfect.
2,Bizarre Music,"I don't know when these songs were on the show. The only familiar one is obviously the theme song. This is some seriously weird music. It might appeal to some people, but this depressing, goth-wanna-be stuff is not my thing. Definitely try to listen before buying this."
5,VERY COOL,"I love this CD. I love Gilmore Girls.. SOOOOOO MUCH. It's the best show in the entire world and the leads are amazing actresses. I never miss an episode. I love all of the songs on the cd, especially the 'lala's'. They are very cute.Great CD.. Excellent Show"
2,Ho Hum,Buy this for the theme song and after that you'll wish it was on iTunes so you get it there and could skip the other nonsense recorded here. The other songs barely even resemble the genre of music featured in the story plots or playing in the background.
5,Great music,"If you like the Gilmore Girls shows, then this cd is a must. I bought it for my 14 year old daughter. She was thrilled when she opened the cd on Christmas."
2,not a best vest,This vest doesn't really keep my daughter on the water. I just ordered a different vest. Hope that one will work.
1,Did not send what was in the picture,The primary picture of this product is blue and yellow. The description of the floatie does not say that the product sent will vary from the photo. My son is not going to wear a pink and purple flowered floatie. I'm sending this back. Very disappointed.
1,Way undersized for high end of 2-3 old for which it is advertised.,Way undersized for high end of 2-3 old age range for which it is advertised as fitting. Our granddaughter is said to be just over 50% percentile in weight and height. Note that other reviews have same complaint.
1,Not for 2 yr old,"If the child doesn't know what is going on, this floater is useless. My son is year and a half. I couldn't trust on this equipment to keep his head above water. It kept on toppling him sideways. For kids from age 2 is misleading, should have stated that the kid should know what swimming is.Anyway, I will keep it, should be useful (as per other reviews) after the age 3."
2,Works painfully well,"I bought a couple of these last summer for my (then) 4 and 8 year old sons. They are on the slim side and had no trouble keeping the device on. They both felt comfortable in the pool and even released their terror grip from my shoulders. The MAIN PROBLEM is the chaffing. Since the device is meant to float, it goes with gravity and goes up. This causes the straps on the side to bunch up under the armpits and rub the skin raw. It works but is painful by the end of the day."
3,"Great product, fatally flawed","My two year old daughter swims on her own easily with this and is confident that she will not go under. It has held up well except for one problem. The strap that goes between the child's legs and connects the two pads, preventiing the vest from slipping up over the head (strap conveniently not pictured above) chafes the skin badly. The vest came with an add-on fix of a grey piece of foam, which is easily lost.The two pads should be connected with a swimsuit type liner that disperses the force and does not chafe. I'd buy another one no problem if that one improvement were made."
3,For older tots,"I got this for my 2 year old son (who is petite) - it fit him well but once we were in the water, it was very unstable. He kept tipping to either side and couldn't stay floating in the proper position. We borrowed a friend's ring with a seat (so the child doesn't fall through the hole) and he played for hours very happily. Plus my arms got a little rest."
1,Dangerous,"Although initially our 2 year old was doing pretty well with this in the pool, after an hour, one of the strap came off and the other one was close to ripping off as well. I'm sure that if this would not have happened, I would highly recommend this device to assist in teaching children to balance themselves in water and begin swimming, but unfortuantely, this is a major health hazard and they should be recalled. I advise all parent who have purchased this to inspect it thoroughly and of course, not leave your child alone in the water for even the briefest moment. Perhaps this one was a fluke but nonetheless, I intend to contact the manufacture and file a complaint."
2,Definitely NOT for a child under 2,"I bought this floaty for my 11 month old that LOVES the water. I though it would be great since he enjoys splashingaround and kicking. First of all it's REALLY hard to get on. Once you finally do, it's impossible to keep your childperpendicular to the water. My baby would either fall face down or onto his back with half his head in the water. I had to holdhim straight up the whole time. This basically made the floaty useless. I feel I wasted my money and now have anotheruseless item laying aroung the house. I do NOT recommend this floaty."
3,Great for new learners,"The little swimr swin trainer has done wonders for my daughter on learning to swim. She is 4 years old and can now swim on her own, but still supervised. The ability to remove the insterts was a great idea. I am very happy with this product and have recommended it to many friends."
2,Poorly Made and Possibly Dangerous!,"This swim trainer is a good idea; however, the straps tore the first day. Could have been very dangerous if I wasn't right there in the water with my child. I attempted to repair them, but I just don't trust that they won't rip again. I believe there was another reviewer who said the straps did not hold; therefore, I don't think it was a fluke that this happened. I do not recommend this product!"
3,"If you wernt lucky enough 2 be there ,this is a sad substitute",trying to capture something as wonderful as the world created around the dead by there loving fans is no easy task and not in my opinion shown very well in this atempt yes every thing you see is reminisant of little corners of the dead world an enteresting look at world that no longer exsists and for those of you who unfortuantly wernt there just know while this gives a small glimpse just a mere scratch of the surface that those of us who were there sadly will recoginize and miss in this film . still an historical record none the less to be at least to be seen as such
2,"Terrible movie, but the Kesey interview at the end is a jewel","This movie was a big disappointment. In some sense it shows the worst of the scene that followed the Dead in their latter days. It's noteworthy that there's _no_ music by The Grateful Dead in it - I understand they refused to allow any. However, the short extra at the end, "" A Conversation with Ken Kesey"" is one of the clearest and most concise expressions of what the Acid Trips, and the Grateful Dead/Jerry Garcia at their best, were about."
4,Just Say No,"If ever there was an anti-drug film, this is it, without even trying to be. The young women obviously strung out on ecstasy are complete dolts. Did the hippies have ecstasy? The sober people who also enjoyed the Grateful Dead concert were very clear headed and talked about how much better the experience was without drugs. Since drugs contributed to many Dead deaths over the years, it is amazing that some people think they must enjoy the music by getting high. Think about how much better life in general would be with all of your faculties on go. The video is very good, except for the tacked on ""A Conversation with Ken Kesey,"" which just has him rambling into the camera."
2,"Given the Time Again, I'd Choose a More Interesting Book","This book varies in quality throughout its pages. At times it is pretty interesting and you want to read the next chapter to know what will happen next and at others, well most of the book to be honest you're getting quite bored. The chapters with Junior or undercover cops are pretty interesting but Susan could have been made a bit less complicated and a lot more interesting.The story is basically about Susan who is a New York District Attorney who specialised in repossessing proceeds of crime. New players in New York's garbage removal industry are having their dogs' heads cut off or drivers' heads smashed in. The Mafia doesn't want new players and the hot headed, low IQ'd Junior, son of mob boss Tesla is addicted to violence. Susan is also having domestic problems in the mist of accidentally getting involved in this garbage war. Can she gather enough evidence to prosecute before it is too late?"
4,Given Got a Nifty Crime,"It was a clever idea to team up a lawyer with a script writer. Mrs. Barrett should be congratulated on apparently seeing her limitations.The result is a ""new"" kind of crime, written up with refreshing humor.This book is interesting and a good summer read for those who look for more than a 500-word vocabulary."
5,The best I've read on the subject!,"My shelves are chock full of books on ADHD and how to manage children with the condition. Focusing on the teenager put a different spin on what we experience. As parents, we know how chaotic teen years can be for everyone! This book was by far the most complete compendium of information I've seen. Helpful insights on how to keep a positive outlook on the future, viewing your teen with compassions and understanding as we confront the many challenges this condition demands for both the teen and the parents. Very helpful explanations of meds and their potential side-effects. I actually bought a copy as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine who has a son with ADHD. Truly a super resource, which I refer to often."
3,More of the same,"I have a small collection of ADHD books.....but this text seemed repetitive with not a lot of new information and not presented with much creativity. I returned it. If it is your first book, it's fine."
4,adhd,This is a great reference for parents who are dealing with the issue. one of the many books i recommend
3,An OK Seagal movie.,"My wife is a big Seagal fan. This is not one of his best, but if you like Seagal, it will be OK."
4,Urban Justice,I have always been a fan of Steven Segall and his movie Urban Justice was just as exciting and action packed
3,Decent effort from Seagal,"Urban Justice is better than a lot of Seagal's DTV releases. The storyline is well written but I got a little lost in the middle of the movie for some reason. That has happened to me in a few of Seagal's recent films. It's not that they bore me, I just sometimes get a little confused on what is going on. There is no voice dubbing at all from what I can tell and appears he does his own fight scenes which is really nice to see. Could have also used a reduction in the strong language department. All in all, a for sure see for any Seagal fan.Peter J. Miller"
1,unhappy,The movies i ordered i never received..i received two of the same movies that i never heard of..and never got a response to my e-mail from the seller..wont order again.
1,The Return of the Flubber,"This Seagal flick is a little bit tighter than his other straight to DVD shows. Just a little. He still spends more than half of the film in shadow to hide his weight, and mumbles his lines as if he just wanted to finish the scene and go home. The fight scenes are not as sloppy as others I've seen (though I love the ""15 shots to the crotch"" scene), but the shootouts go way over the top. Lots of wild shooting, no aimed shots, and ridiculous amounts of blood. Speaking of that, how Eddie Griffin got conned into playing a sterotypical gangbanger beats me. Wait a minute--it must've been one thing; PAYCHECK! He throws the clock back 10,000 years for African Americans in this film with his moronic portrayal of a sleazy, filthy mouthed gangbanging dope dealer. And what's up with the raccoon on Seagal's head??? We all know you're losing your hair Steve--give it up and show us the bald spot in the next film. One star from me, just for Seagal showing up (and more than likely, late)."
4,"What can I say, all Valdemar books are good!","This is a collection of stories about people in Valdemar. The stories, naturally, lack depth (that is why they are SHORT stories!), but they are good. This is a great book for those of you who are (like me!) impatiently awaiting more Heralds of Valdemar books to come out! It's definately an enjoyable read, and enough to tide you over until another novel comes out. If I could have, I would have given this book 4 and a half stars, but I decided to round it down because this is definately not my favorite book in the Valdemar series, but it is worthy of the read if you're a fan!"
4,A great introduction and tribute to the world of Valdemar.,"Although I had never read the original Valdemar series, the tales told in this anthology easily introduced me to that interesting world. As I am a fan of short stories, I probably won't read the Valdemar novels, but if I were a big novel reader, I definitely would read them immediately."
4,It was okay,"I thought about 1/2, maybe 3/4 of these stories were good, and worth the read, but some fell flat in my opinion. Maybe they were just too short, but I found a few boring, and without the ""tone"" of Valdemar (or maybe it's just MLs writing) that I've come to adore. If you've got the time, give it a try, but don't strain yourself to get at it."
1,A Disappointing Read,"I bought this anthology with anticipation, as I have enjoyed the Valdemar series thoroughly. However, the majority of the stories read like mediocre fan fiction rather than professional submissions. My recommendation: avoid this book, but do read the associated Valdemar series by Lackey."
1,absolute and utter crap,"I have never experienced so many clogged heads as with these ""compatible"" cartridges. I wasted over 2 hours the other night - right before a nasty deadline - trying to get the cartridge head to unclog and print correctly. Never did happen, ended up having to deliver a sub-standard product. Unacceptable.These cheap cartridges are too expensive. I'm going back to the Epson branded."
1,bad game,"Its really not worth your money. After you play the first stage, you will be amazed how beautiful and creative people from Westwood studios are. But after the second, third stage, you will realize that there's no point to beat this game. Ackward graphics, repetitive and boring. And its slow too. I'm sure that people who give this game 5 star is just playing the first stage only. WARNING: Because of slow and dropping framerates, dizziness and motion sickness will occur after half an hour playing."
3,"hmmm, like tribes 2","This game reminds me of tribes 2 but without the jet packs. This games also reminds me of outbreak. you get credits by mining teberian which is unique because you get to play a labor worker. Nothing new with the weapons but I do like the ""Ion Canon"" great mass destruction weapon. Graphics are alright, a little better than tribes 2. Could've came up with better environemnts for battle because it's so bland. I'm comparing this to Allied Forces right now. Nothing groundbreaking here, but a nice addition to the Command and Conquer series."
4,"Great game, almost perfect, but not quite.","This game is, as is suggested in the title, almost perfect, but not quite. Don't get me wrong, I bought it, but there are still some issues with graphics and gameplay that some individuals may find annoying.Any real C&C; fan will instantly fall in love with it, as I did, but others will be hard-bought.All in all, it is a very fun ... game that is definately worth the money you will spend on it."
5,Great fps from C and C,"This game is old but tons of fun. Intakes a lot of teamwork and strategy, the campaign has a pretty good story as well"
5,still a great multiplayer game!!!,"ive played every command & conquer game in the series and loved them all, but none have kept me coming back like this one! always played multiplayer using gamespy back when renegade was first introduced and for the many years i played afterwards. upgraded to windows 7, and an apparently a yard sale catastrophe, i no longer could install renegade (lost disc). found it here for [...] and free shipping and haven't stopped playing. there are now more options in multiplayer mode - also now ran through 'gamespy comrade' (free version). players have the ability to call in back-up of different types (air-strikes, 5 or so anti-infantry/tank cpu players, purchase/place a turret for increased defenses). this game is an absolute must for any first-person shooter fan! just to give you, the reader, a better idea ...other games i play - battlefield bad company 2, unreal tournament, world of warcraft."
4,My first FPS game but not the best,"I bought Command and Conquer first decade after playing zero hour with a friend. I knew it had other games with it but didn't care until I beat zero hour for the fourth time on HARD. I was most unexperienced with fps games so this new to me. As a newbie I thought this was a cool game. Than came Halo and its graphics and AI.Pros:good shooting game for 13 and up little to no blood for parents out thereclassic C&C; gamegreat soundtrackdon't need a expencive graphics card to playLAN playableCons:graphicsthe in game clips were terrible qualitythe timimg with the voices and the lips were off by a secondThe game AI was very stupid in multiplayer practice. I'd shoot one guy in the head and the guy next to him would duck then stand still like a drunk.between Halo and this I would pick halo, but still a good game"
5,See through the eyes of a GDI commando,"Renegade is an incredible game. I've noticed a few people giving it a low score simply because of the somewhat laggy multiplayer demo...That is just a demo, and it is not always slow. If I can find the right server, it runs at a great speed for me, and I only have an 8 MB video card and 56k connection. Okay, back to the game. First off, the graphics aren't perfect. Then again, no game has perfect graphics. The gameplay, however, absolutely rocks. Partially it's a first person shooter. But in addition, 15 GDI and NOD vehicles are available to control whenever you feel like driving, with full weaponry. You can also use any weapon you can pick up, from machine guns to portable ion cannons. Simply put, this is an awsome game."
5,Good Game,"O.K first things firstSingle playerThe weak part of the game don't botherA.I is stupid missions are either too easy or too hard there is no middle ground. Also I could find no way to skip the cutscenes which annoyed me to no end.Multiplayer-The great part!!!Nonstop action, you ever wanted to drive a tank? how bout a Nod Buggy? Its not just killing things that makes it fn it is also the time and effort EA took in designing the building. Weather you are playing as a vehicle buster or a medic there is always something for you to do. Take me for instance even though I always get my butt kicked I still have a good time.My favorite thing to do is fly the hellicopterOverall-Great for fans of halflife, rainbow6, Solider of Fortune and Delta Force. Come one come all, there is much fun to be had."
5,The finest multiplayer experience yet.,"Fans of the C&C; series, fans of the shooting genre (first and third person), and fans of multiplayer mayhem, rejoice.I have yet to see any game come close to the sheer fun of Renegade. Imagine a 60 player team match, with beautiful graphics and hardly any lag at all. Snipers lining the hills taking out the troopers who are storming across the battle field littered with mammoth tanks. This has been brought to reality, this is Renegade.Simply playing the multiplayer demo is enough to convince me this is the most enjoyable online shooter ever...However, if you are thinking of buying Renegade for the single player game, let me direct you to Medal Of Honor instead."
4,okay i only played the demo,this game is just okay it has a lot of lag and whever i tried to get a plane the (because hackers like me have air mod hehehehehe) would always bunch up together and you couldent fly the cause it would be stuck all and all it an okay game ...
2,Potential,"The game has potential, in fact it is fun to play but....It is one of the most frustrating games I have ever played.When you are killed you flash to a screen that askes if you want to load or quit. Hit load and after 40 seconds you flash to another screen that asks you what game you want to load. Click on the one you are playing and in another 40 seconds it loads. I'm running a high end machine and I find this interface between loads to be a lot like a bad commercial during a good movie. It has also locked up my computer several times and frequently crashed back to the desktop. With all of the good shooters out now, I wish I would have waited another month and bought it when it goes on sale...."
2,could have been a lot better,"i was really disappointed with c&c's newest release. Although i am not one of those fanatical C&C fans, i do love first person shooters (fps). The AI is the most horrible i've ever seen in a fps, and i've played a lot of games. The characters look like boxes, Havoc's personality is a cardboard cutout, the script and story line is hilariously bad, and Havoc's lines are corny. Most of all, both the single player and multiplayer are desperately below par. The single player was much too short, the bosses are too easy to kill, and the scenery is atrocious. The multiplayer is just as bad, since the base defences are much too difficult to bypass and you can only carry one weapon at a time. Westwood truly disappointed me with this game, i thought they were capable of a more thought out and prepared game. If you are going to spend [$$$] on a game, spend in on Max Payne or Return to Castle Wolfenstein. Unless you're a diehard C&C fan, this one probably isn't for you."
2,Well meaning film is dull compared to Hill's others,"The film has some good elements, but not enough humor and not enough of Hill's well-liked character. Instead, there is too much with side characters of lesser interest. Even though I like ""Lotta Legs"", the film really fails to deliver for fans who were hoping for another entry in Terence Hill's famous western spoof genre. The film is of clear interest, however, to youngsters who like horses."
2,Ughhh! What a disappointment!,"Our first experience with Lucky Luke was the animated movie. What a great flick! Much to our dismay, this movie doesn't hold up. There are some mildly funny parts and some well-trained horses. Beyond that, the story is wanting and the acting is sub-par. Not worth the purchase."
4,A Long Love Affair,"About 3 years ago, I was blessed enough to meet the guys of Homunculus and haven't stopped loving them since! Their music is so differant than a lot of the crap that is out today and their shows are filled with so much energy and excitment. Although Words is not my favorite of their cd's (Their first CD is my favorite), it still ranks right up there with some of my all time top picks. The music fits the guy's crazy personalities, I can picture Ben (lead singer)jumping around stage when I listen to Words or Kevin singing soulfully into the microphone. They are not a band who changes completely from live shows to CD's so if you have a chance to see them live, do so (and push for them to come to your area!) I like the direction the band has been moving in and can't wait to hear the new album which is rumored to be underway!"
5,"What wrong with you, Amazon???","This was an excellent CD. Homunculus brings back the music of long ago and turns it into something new and exciting. ""Here And There"", ""Deep South Beach"", and ""Stargazing"" are awesome.My only problem is that Amazon, who is supposed to have everything, is missing Homunculus's first two albums. What's the deal with that!? ""Words"" is, believe it or not, their third album. Their first album, ""Homunculus"" has the original version of ""Okay"", and I own their second album, ""The Pulse Of Directed Devotion"", which is an awesome album, and features concert standards, ""Get Outta The Way"", and ""Basic Word"". So, Amazon, stock this album!!!! If not, I guess I'll just have to wait until I see them in concert again... Oh, well."
2,Didn't Like It,"Technically this is a very good film; but, it doesn't have the rich colors and exquisite cinematography that I've come to expect from Chinese art films such as Raise the Red Lantern, Farewell My Concubine, Flowers of Shanghai etc. The flavor is, in my limited experience, very Japanese and the mood of the film reminded me of ""Ran"" - very stark, cold, and brutal."
5,A story of prehistory and the birth of civilization,"Very highly recommended reading for anyone with an interest in antiquarian history and/or the history of religion, In Sons Of God Daughters Of Men, Edward F. Malkowski pieces together a story of prehistory and the birth of civilization from the myths of Genesis discovered through the revelations of archaeology. Exploring the legends of history and various culture folklore, as well as cities from Biblical times, the search to locate Eden, the evolution of religious and spiritual thought since prehistoric times, and so much more, Sons Of God Daughters Of Men offers a thoughtful and thought-provoking wealth of insights into the gradual process of an increasing cultural sophistication in humankind's attempts to grapple with both real and spiritual dilemmas."
1,Extremely Unhelpful,"I have used a computer with wires for almost twenty years. I read this book because I am interested in setting up a system for a couple of wireless computers in my apartment. My daughter bought and read the book for the same reason. We both found the book extremely muddled and no help whatsoever for our purposes.We both probably qualify as complete idiots - we wouldn't even expect to set up the system ourselves, we just wanted to begin to understand what wireless computing would do for us. This book is not for us."
3,From Back Cover,"Sexy, single... and stacked. That's how most men in the Windy City would describe the infamous Cassandra Ward. And Cassandra is happy to play along - providing her men follow her rules. No touchy-feely emotions. Just white-hot sex. But when Noah Barclay, heir to the family empire, propositions her at a wedding, he's got more on his mind than a quick fling. He wants her totally and completely.For Noah, Cassandra is the woman if his dreams - literally. In fact, he can't get the image of her dark mane, voluptuous curves or kissable lips out of his head. But her gorgeous body is just the start. He knows Cassandra is in need of some TLC, but will a kiss and one sizzling night, which leaves her breathlessly begging for more, be all that it takes to convince her?[4th in The Bachelorette Pact series]"
5,Excellent purchase ! Offer Nissim,"The delivery time and the conditions of this disc was perfect. I have purchased this compact disc as a gift, and my friend love it !"
3,Ok,After seeing all the hype reviews I was drawn to purchase this cd. Personally I did not like it. Only a few tracks caught my attention. Maybe it is just me.
1,"Corn well fan but not this one,",The prose is hard work and repetitive. The story takes a long time to get going and is designed to keep you interested but only serves to get you more annoyed. Sorry Cornwell but this is not a best seller.
1,Recycled old romance novel,This is a recycled Romance novel(circa 1983) by Susana Kells(Presumably Cornwell's wife). Maybe he rewrote a bit of it; maybe he just attached his name to gain greater readership. A Bernard Cornwell bloody adventure novel it is not.
2,"Definitely not ""woman friendly""","I thought this book started out terrific, by the time I got 2/3 of the way through, it seemed simply a device to put a helpless,childlike woman through a series of captures/tortures so she could be rescued by a hero. Perhaps I am used to today's more modern heroines who show some resourcefulness and grit, or perhaps I missed the point of this book altogether."
1,BEWARE!!!!,"This CD is completely 'mastered' from a VINYL LP! Obviously, it sounds really terrible with quieter tracks like 'Almond Eyes' and 'Moustaches On The Moon' coming off the worst. 'Crackles','pops' and general distortion run rampant throughout and Cherry Red should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a shabby edition of this long-awaited LP. Nowhere on the (actually quite nice) packaging does it state that this CD was taken from a vinyl album.Buy it if you want, but I guarantee you'll be disappointed.A further note. Whether the original masters still exist, I have no idea, but 'S-S-Single Bed' features on a UK compilation album (the excellent 'Guilty Pleasures') and DOES sound like it comes from the aforementioned mastertapes. It sounds a whole lot better than the crackly, distorted version on here!"
2,Poorly designed,"This clock base is not well designed to hold heavy Weems & Path clock. Base is not wide enough depth-wise to securely hold clock. Returned it and ordered similar base with back panel, which works much better as you can secure top of clock to back panel with a small screw."
2,Problem with audio when using cable to record,"I bought this machine and returned it. Why? Although this machine has many fancy features, it has problem with the most basic function: voice recording.When recording on 8mm tape with cables (battery was not charged yet) as power source, the recorded audio had very noisy static, a little like the siren in the ambulance. Totally unacceptable.Sony, why not make sure that your products can do some basic things correctly before spend so much efforts to build those mostly useless fancy features."
3,Warning: sony/legacy messes up once again.....,"I bought this for alot of good songs not on their other countless best of's their labels keep releasing I hope they finailly have given up on selling the same songs over and over with this compilation which combines their Epic and Capitol years on 2 cd's. Nice liner notes,rare photos,and remasteredsound. However major problem. The second track on disc two has a different vocal track of ann singing actually kinda like it was an alternate take used instead and its kinda remixed as is other tracks on disc 2 either vocally different or added effects were used on these tracks. The tracks altered come from the 1985 s/t Capitol album. I actually traded up my 97'Capitol best of Heart album for this one and im a little upset. The rest of the songs from the other albums on this compilation arent messed with suprisingly. So really I wouldnt reccomend this at all"
4,heart has heart,"The sisters are so much better live in concert. They haven't aged a bit. I saw them at the Oregon state fair 2007. What an awesome, flawless performance.......Tanya"
4,Heart CD,For any Heart fans out there this is the CD for you. It has all their greatest songs and many more. It is 2 disc's of great music. I would recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for all the good songs on one album.
5,Essential Heart,"This is a must listen album. I recommend this album to anyone, whether or not your a Heart fan. Every time I listen to this album it relaxes me or even excites me. It makes me feel alive and full of energy i can't describe in words it is that good. I could go on and on about how exhilarating this album is but I think its time for others to hear it for themselves. So anyone who is a Heart fan I know you will love it. Anyone who is not yet a Heart fan, buy it and just listen to it. I'm telling you right now its going to make you a believer!!!"
5,I forgot how much I loved to listen to these women sing,"I had forgotten about "" Heart "" for years. They were always wonderful to listen to. I am so very glad that I got this CD for me collection, and reintroduced me to their sound once again. It's worth a listen."
4,One Song Short of Essential,Only one tune short of a complete essentials collection: Mistral Wind.Surely there are one or two that made the cut that could have been dropped if favor of this one.
3,Two CDs is stretching the good tracks thin,"I couldn't find a single disc collection that contained both their 70s and 80s hits. It's a shame too, because their aren't NEARLY enough quality tracks to warrant 2 CDs.Also, I found it bizarre that the booklet only contained pictures from very early in their career. I guess there is some unwritten rule about not showing anything but a thin Nancy Wilson."
3,Classic Heart!,"I like this Cd, Heart rocks & are the most talented musical ladies around ever! My only complaint about this Cd is there are quite a few songs I wasn't familiar with, that aren't mainstream. Some songs are definitely a genre that I think even Heart may have regretted performing. I dunno, it's just that a few songs sound kinda lame for Heart. But that's my opinion! The majority of the Cd is a-ok w/ me, took me back to high school!"
3,What about the missing hits?,"Overall a great collection of nifty Heart classics, but where are the hits: Even It Up and Bebe Le Strange? I like the fact that they divide the two CDs into the 70's rock era and the 80's ""fluff"" material as Heart themselves even call it. To me, the 80's fluff material isn't worth my time, but the classics on disk one make this worth the price of admission, despite the fact that it's missing at least two of their best hits. But if you're like me and not into the 80's fluff material, you're better off getting their previous Greatest Hits CD/album which only covers their rock era and does include truly all their best hits including the two they left off this compilation."
5,Excellent choice for rockin' out!,"If you plan on going for a long drive at night at high speeds (or during the day with the windows down), disc 1 is the cd to bring along. It can be played real loud and is easy to sing along to. Before I bought this I knew the standards (Crazy on You, Barracuda, Magic Man) With this cd, I've come to love Heartless and Love Alive and the others.Disc 2 is also pretty good, but those songs aren't really why I got the thing. If you buy this compilation, you won't really need to buy anything else by Heart...ever!"
4,Lucky Heart!,"This compilation does a great job of gathering the highlights of Heart. As with all anthologies, you can argue about what songs should or shouldn't have been included,but nevertheless a well chosen and thorough collection. The most promising thing is the great sound quality of these recordings. I really hope Rhino puts together a Deep Purple anthology like this one. Two jam packed CD's from the ""classic"" Purple lineup. One greatest hits disc is NOT enough and the 4 disc set is too expensive.This is a very reasonably priced and well put together collection!"
5,LOTS OF HEART!,"This is a really good double CD. I like Heart a lot, but never owned any of their music. This is a good collection of their hits."
3,Complete for their career and diversity,"I like the Wilson's from the 70s and respect their talent and longevity, for me it is ok as I am not a fan of the later material, but comprehensive"
3,Familiar Stranger is not Heart,"To the person looking for the ""Heart"" song Familiar Stranger, its not on this release cuz its not a Heart song. I believe that song is actually Starship, and the song is just called Stranger.As for this release on hand, some but not all of the songs deserve the title ""Essensial"". I prefer their earlier work to their later stuff. Would have prefered a collection that contained more from the earlier albums rather than songs like ""Alone"" or ""Never"" or ""Nothing at All"" etc. Problem is, those songs, and that period for Heart, were when they were most successfull commercially, so Greatest Hits packages are going to include that material. For me personally, their other Greatest Hits packages (the one from 1980 ""Greatest Hits/Live"" and the one from 1998 I believe) have the material that I prefer over this one. This release here isn't bad, but my preference is for different material from this band.chris..."
3,Wrong version of Dreamboat Annie ruins the set,"I suppose it was done to please Rock purists, but the version of Dreamboat Annie included with this set is the second, or reprise of the song from the same titled album. The first version included a background banjo track, and probably was left out because of it. Too bad, the reprise completely sucks, and is way too slow. I'm sorry that I can't take this back. So it goes with the music industry. Throw in trash, and make it impossible to return."
3,Where are the original releases?,"Great overall collection. I have 5 other Heart CDs but wanted this new remastered disc. Second disc is great...except that I noticed ""Nothin' At All"" wasn't the original release. Why would you do that?! So be careful, there may be more non-original songs."
3,Not enough hits for a 2-CD set,"Heart really does not have enough hits to fill a 2-CD set. Die-hard Heart fans may like all 37 songs there, but causal fans will find it a bit boring. Their biggest hits were those 80's ones and written by other composers. Their own materials were primarily from the 70's. They were quite refreshing at the time. This CD set is a limited edition probably because of the licensing materials from Capital Record. If someone squeezes the best from this 2-CD set and make a single CD, I will give it a 4 stars."
2,not essential,"Ann and Nancy Wilson are legends-no doubt about it. I'm a huge fan of their seventies stuff, so disc one is my favorite. But since I have all their albums from the seventies up to and including Bebe Le Strange, I don't feel the need to buy this cd. As one other person pointed out, Mistral Wind not there? Dream of the Archer not there? Magazine not there? C'mon!!!! I love Heart, love the 'Mongers, but I'm leaving this one ""Alone"". And please gals, come on out with some new stuff! We are ready...How about some acoustic stuff like you used to do ie: Nada One, Cry to Me, Just the Wine. PS -someone is confusing Jefferson Starship with Heart. They sang Familiar Stranger I believe."
1,SONY MUSIC producing defective HEART cds,"I bought the ""Essential Heart"" cd from Tower Rercords this weekend.I just tried listening to it but Track #17 SKIPS and shuts down my media player.The store (TOWER) is closing down & they refuse to even EXCHANGE IT!They told me to contact the ones who release this album. All the info. & links on the back of the cd are no longer valid. I went to SonyMusic and even their links to this cd are defunct. I was able to find [...]which links back to SonyMusic - but when I call the two ""QUALITY MANAGMENT"" phone numbers they have, both are defunct and refer me back to the store I bought it from.I am extremely angry and want my $15 back! No wonder Tower is going out of business with such bad customer service. All I'm going to be more careful before I buy a Sony/CapitolRecords cd!"
5,Real concepts of real system design,The book help a lot for embedde system design. It covers some complex problems that a system designer can face during development. If anyone having some interest in such area SHOULD read this book at least once.With Best Wishespankaj
4,internet address book,It's really a nice book. 5 x 7 in size... it's not too cumbersome and very professional looking. It suits my purpose- which is to provide user name and passwords in the event of my illness or death. I just hope it doesn't fall into the wrong hands before it's intended use.
4,Handy Computer Address Book,"This book has really helped me organize all the websites and email addresses that were on slips of paper, or filling up my regular address book. Besides the traditional alphabetical section to fill in info. on websites, there is also a section called Sites by Subject and a section to record Internet purchases. It is a very handy book!"
5,GREAT BOOK!!,"Dude, this is the greatest book ever!! It has lots of facts! It also has pin ups of each guy! I'm tellin' ya it's awesome! Who ever wrote it is a genius! IT'S GREAT! It even has pictures of the guys when they were kids! I really like it! It's one of my favorite books! I read the whole thing the same day that I got it! That's how good it is! If you are an nsync fan GO BUY IT NOW!! If you're someone that's just looking at stuff this is a great book to own! SO BUY IT! The pictures are great! I'm tellin' ya buy it! It's way COOL! So just give it a try. If you don't like it you can always take a refund. But who would wanna? So buy it!"
5,A must read tome.,"Author Fermor's vocabulary is the best I have encountered. His travel tales rival Mark Twain's. This book should on every English class read list. Buy it or borrow it, you will not be disappointed. The descriptions of 1934 Central Europe are simply awewsome."
3,A crash course in eastern europe,"Fermor traveled by foot from the Hook of Holland to Constantiople; this book is the second volume of his remembrances of that trip, starting off halfway through the journey at Budapest (where the previous volume, A Time of Gifts, left off). Oh, wait, I didn't mention that he made this trip in 1934 when he was 18. The book is an incredibly dense package of flora and fauna, history and action, characters and settings. For someone as unfamiliar as I about this area, it provided a crash course in providing for an understanding of the region."
4,Fascinating author of the hard-boiled mystery,"This film is an interesting look at Dashiell Hammett, the master of the hard-boiled detective novel, who wrote lovely prose and then drank his ill-health to the breaking point. He was a Pinkerton detective, a TB patient, a friend of William Faulkner, and an intimate friend of Lillian Hellman. Hammett joined the Armed Forces during WWII, became a card-carrying Communist, and was imprisoned during McCarthy's red scare.The film is well-done and incorporates lots of photographs and clips from the films he authored, as well as lines from his novels and stories. If you've read Hammett, you'll want to read more, and if you haven't, this film will prompt you to delve into some of his works. It's definitely worth seeing, because the story of Hammett himself is as fascinating as the stories he wrote."
4,Accurate and entertaining overview of mystery writer's life,"Well-researched documentary, with Oscar nominee David Strathairn as the voice of Hammett, and interviews with Hammett's daughter Jo, other people who knew him (Jack Bjoze, Emmy Kronenberger, Ring Lardner, Jr., Bill Glackin, Victor Rabinowitz, Muriel Alexander), and Hammett researchers David Fechheimer, Richard Layman, Diane Johnson, and Joan Mellen. Includes rare photos & movie footage of Hammett. Most items about Hammett play loose with the facts. This one is accurate and entertaining as well."
4,Fun to Fly and blow stuff up,"I tried the demo from www.novaworld.com but and it was fun but the excitement didnt compare with the full version and of course having the keyboard layout made a big difference. I am still learning how to complete the missions, its quite a challenge.The graphics were great, I use a Nvidia TnT 32mb video card, Win98SE, a ViewSonic A70f monitor and my computer speed is 1.4Ghz AMD Athlon so speed and graphics are great. I highly recommend this product to someone who wants a challenging and fun game."
4,Good but not great,"This game is a good game with easy controls and interesting missions. It also requires you to make quick decisions that will dictate whether you win or lose. Th main problem in the game is that it's too easy. For some reason i don't believe that a Comanche can take two direct missile hits in the tail and make still be flying. But, overall it's a good game with interesting missions (if you know how to lay them right) that require skill and cunning."
3,Worth the cash,"Comanche 4's graphics are superb, if a little arcady. Although I found that I collided with hills a little too often this was probably as much down to my skill as the flight model.Tanks blow up nicely but using the 'ripple-fire' technique can be a bit complicated. Overall, a great game, worth the input.Can Novalogic please make it easier to create missions???"
2,Comanche 4,"NOT worth the money! Not a Sim. not even a good arcade Game. What a shame, good to great in special effects (Bombs,etc.)but to high in hardware needed for this type of game. Even the old Apache is way better in game play. Wait a year or so and get it for a song, even an out of tune one. Don't buy it at full or even half price!!!!"
1,Comanche Rehash,This game is just a remake of Comanche in a new box. The only thing new is new missions. The graphics are not updated and overall was very disappointing.
2,you better got a high end graphic card....,.....or you dont even get started....i waited a while for this game and was excited when i got it but surprice...no way to run the game with a exotic or low end graphic card....the minimum requirements for this game are high and this doesnt mean fun when you got them....stick with the recommended requirements and you get alot fun out of the game.....fact is i have now a game to sell because im not going to update my computer for $300 or more to play a $40 game
5,More than I expected.,"When I saw this game for 9.99, I thought it might be a flop, but the graphics looked great, so I bought it.The exceeded my expectations. The scenery is great, the game play is great. Everything about this game is great.It runs smoothly on my 1.3GHZ AMD Athlon with a Radon 9000 Pro video card. If you are looking for a fun game, and don't want to spend too much, try this game out."
2,Much more arcade than simulator,"I was originally disappointed by the low fidelity of this as a simulator. Having flight experience in real helicopters, I was hoping for a lot more realism. My first few minutes of the game were a great disappointment as I realized that all of the aerodynamics that make a helicopter tricky to fly (but extremely fun) are not replicated in this game. Also, I could not find any way to aim the gun manually without moving the whole helicopter. Most combat helos are able to move a turret without the necessity of moving the craft.As a game it is great. After my initial shock of not being able to boost the realism, I sat back and decided to enjoy it with the mindset of playing an arcade. It is much more fun to play if I think of it that way."
1,Do not buy if you have a video card with a TV out!,"I have never gotten this game to function with my video card. After a mission loads, the game crashes every time. According to technical support, this game is prone to do this with many video cards with a TV out, and hat they're developing a patch to fix this. It's been almost a year and no patch has appeared."
3,Not the treasure I expected.,"The book is adequate. Period. Next time I'll pay more attention to descriptions when ordering books that are reproduced from old texts. Got the book yesterday and checked it out - was disappointed. Maybe it was my mood - after all, I'd worked a 12 hr. day, so I reviewed it again tonight with the same result.The photos are mostly grainy and small,some patterns don't have any illustration. If it had cost more, I'd return it. There is value here, but truthfully, the book will probably spend most of its life sitting on my bookshelf."
3,Useful but not inspiring,"What you see in the title is what you get in the book - stitch patterns. While basic directions are provided for garments, if you are looking for ideas for your next project, you probably won't find them here. I use this book as a reference, when I need to solve a problem, learn a new technique or refine one I already know. Worth having for that reason."
3,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. I have many others than offer more information. Yes, this book isn't expensive, but after reading the reviews I had hoped for more and this book fell short. If I had seen it, I wouldn't have bought it. Wish it wasn't such a pain to return it, but it would cost so much it would not be worth while. The print type is old and the photos are mostly hand drown. Like the one review stated, not very inspiring."
3,"Politically Incorrect, but Usable","Here's how a sentence in one of the chapters begins: ""The name Faggot Stitch immediately suggests the dainty embroidery used for fancy seaming on dresses, lingerie, etc..."" Statements like this and the sometimes cute, sometimes tasteless accompanying graphics diminish the appeal for me. On the plus side, this book is an experimenter's dream, and a person could go wild just making samplers from all the patterns, which range from easy to complex."
4,Gotta love a Dover book,"types of stitch reference books for the projects they inspire. When I'm bored and want something to knit (or crochet) but don't have anything in mind I turn to stitch guides and make swatches. With a little effort and imagination these swatches can turn into a scarf, lap blanket, the sky's the limit.To correct the reviewer, imgeorg, who cried 'politically correct'; fagoting, or faggoting is a type of open-work embroidery that was used in lace collars, cuffs, etc. Mary Thomas was certainly not making an insinuation of the sort imgeorg referrs to as, assuming she was even familiar with the term, to a woman of her generation that would have been unthinkably unladylike."
5,Love,My almost two year old LOVES Yo Gabba Gabba! I put this on my Kindle so that we can watch at Restaurants or dr's to keep him relaxed!
1,never got it,"my son bought this item and never got to see it, i looked for it on my kindle and it never showed up too bad because i spent a lot of money for somthing i never got"
1,Ordered by mistake,"this was ordered by my 2yr. granddaughter, not by me. Otherwise it is probably a good program for kids although she didn't wastch it much."
2,Kindle version,I was very disappointed with the kindle version of the book. The pictures were in beautiful colors when I viewed the book on the Amazon website. The kindle version is black and white.
4,Great for baking ideas,"First let me agree with everyone else--if you have a gluten allergy, don't bother with this book. However, if you can tolerate gluten, it's great. I agree with the other reviewer in that you may need to tinker with the recipes to get a result you and your family like. In my opinion, the flour charts alone make this book worth buying. I just wish she would have added the carb, protein and fiber counts along with it."
3,Not as good as I expected!,"This book is O.K. and would be helpful to parents provided their child is not sensitive to sugar!! While the author provides substitutes, it would be up to you to ""experiment"" with the recipes. I for one do not have the time to tinker. My daughter has a sugar cane sensitivity among other things and I'd say that the majority of these recipes contain sugar, and quite a bit at that. I tried the banana loaf cake (this one is made with pure maple syrup)and it was EXTREMELY bland!!! We threw that out and the vinegar choc. cake was an absolute disaster because we had to try and guess at an appropriate substitution for the one cup of sugar! All in all, I wish I hadn't spent the money because there just aren't enough recipes that my daughter can actually eat ""as is."""
1,Not for egg and milk allergies,This book has recipes with egg. And lots of kids who have milk allergies seem to have milk and egg. There are very few recipes that I found useful. I got very frustrated trying to find something that my son could eat. Sure you can use soy milk but then there is the egg. Does not make any sense to me. There are much better books out there.This one is useless for me.
5,A must have for families with allergies,"My Kid's Allergic To Everything! is well written and well organized, with lots of useful information about ingredients and substitutions. Great even for those without food issues."
4,Inspiring musical performances by Anne and her guests.,"Anne's voice never sounded better and it's a delight to see and hear the talents of Canadian Roch Voisine (who's phenomenal voice sounds like Jim Croce) and Barenaked Ladies. With lush scenery of Toronto landmark The Old Mill as the backdrop, there's plenty of music (and two performances of Elvis Stojko) to keep young and old happy. Despite some trite dialogue with the guests on this special, the musical highlights include the gospel-sounding ""No Room at the Inn,"" and, quite surpisingly, the inspired harmony of Anne singing with her husband, son, and daughter. Who knew!?! A MUST for Anne Murray fans and those who appreciate gifted voices and harmony."
5,Pasture Production and Management,Excellent book for those working in the professional agricultural discplines; especially range or pasture management or forage agronomy.
2,No subtitles,"Obviously the success of the movie depends on the dialogue. Unfortunately, with so much spoken softly it is hard to follow.Perhaps my reaction would be different with English subtitles (the Spanish did not help!!)"
5,MANHATTAN,A WOODY ALLEN MASTERPIECE IN BLACK AND WHITE . AND FULL OF GEORGE AND IRA GERSHWIN MUSIC AND MANHATTAN TOO BOOT.
4,When Woody wasn't a self-parody,"I watched 'To Rome with Love' at the cineman recently and as soon as Woody started talking, I cringed. What has happened to him? It seems like he's incapable of writing any other kind of version of himself. As for the film, it was okay, but didn't have much to say.Manhattan is the opposite of that. It has something to say. Or maybe Woody has always had the same thing to say and just decided to keep saying it over and over. I love the way Woody is so changeable in Manhattan, as are Diane Keaton and his best friend. Their feelings keep changing and they have to try and keep up and figure out what they really want, if anything. Even at the end, you don't know if Woody will wait those six months. My guess is no, he won't."
5,Rhapsody in Black & White,"You don't have to have been born and raised in Manhattan to fall in love again with each viewing of this contemporary masterpiece, but I was and I do. Forget the Purple Rose of Cairo, I want to leap through the screen and insinuate myself unnoticed into the world of Isaac Davis et. al., and stay forever. Whether Woody is exploring universal truths, questioning our morality, bemoaning our mortality, or hitting you with an Allenism like an uppercut from the floor, he's got you for all 96 minutes. This film seduces you like the title town. Once you've been there, you'll never forget it; and somehow you know you'll be back again."
4,"Woody Allen & New York city , a no-lose situation!","Manhattan gives us both beautifull pictures and images of new york city and shows us how much woody allen truly loves it .Clearly evident his admiration for the city is shown in the movie's first few minutes.Allen brilliantly entertains his audience with his witty comments and his idiosyncratic attitude . However the movie takes more of a serious turn rather than a comedic one.Nevertheless , Manhattan is a must see film for viewers who enjoy Woody Allens movies ."
1,"Great Movie, Terrible Disc Quality","Manhattan is my favorite Woody Allen movie, so this review is based upon the Blu-Ray disc quality alone. And man, is it terrible! There is so much video noise, it looks as though the skies of New York are filled with locusts in every scene. And the sound is not good either. My BD player will only recieve a stereo signal from the disc, even though it is supposed to be DTS HD Master Audio. What a horrible disappointment! I will be returning this, with the hope that they will get it right eventually."
5,***** Fantastic *****,"Clearly one of Woody Allen^s best movies. I saw years ago and again on television last night. I'm buying the DVD. Cast, Crew, Script, cinematography all perfection. It is also a gracious Tribute to New York, a city Mr. Allen truly adores. Bravo"
5,A true valentine,"Woody Allen shares all of his love for the city of New York in one, amazing, beutifful, and flattering film. It's hard to believe that while all of showbuisness was declaring New York a dead town, Mr. Allen showd through celluliod, that it is a town of vast passion. And like the city it represents, Manhattan is at once tough, magnificent, and breathtaking. A tragic piece of bitter sweet cinema."
2,This Is My Last Woody Allen Film!,"Allen is a twice-divorced 42-year-old comedy writer dating 17-year-old Mariel Hemingway who then falls in love with his friend's mistress Diane Keaton. The film is in black and white, with far too many scenes almost too dark to see. 'Boring' is the best one-word summary I can think of for this film."
2,Not a great movie.,"The service was excellent fast shipping! The movie was so boring, I watched it all but it was hard to get in to and I feel as if the movie never really got started. Woody Allen has a few good movies but this is not one of them."
3,Not the best,"This was definitely not the best of Allen's movies in my opinion. As always, dialog and acting were superb. Movie was funny and witty. However I finished watching it asking myself (again - see ""Vicky Christina Barselona"") - so what happened, what's the point? Plus, although I really liked Tracey's character, I found the whole affair of a 42-year-old man dating and sleeping with a 17-year-old school-girl creepy and borderline repulsive."
3,"Not so brilliant,","This film has exceptional cinematography and music(and having watched many of Allen's films), it's a bit disappointing otherwise. The script is quite ordinary. Though this alone does not necessarily degrade a film from masterpiece status, it's not the case for Manhattan, as it is also flawed in other departments.My impressions are: The comedy aspect feels like an attachment to an ordinary and straightforward story about relationships. I found the characters(except 17 years old Tracy) to be a bit artificial and shallow, and maybe understated. Diane Keaton's role as an intellectual artist just does not convince. The jokes are blunt,preachy and not so funny, such as Mary (Keaton) repatedly telling she's from Philadelphia and she believes in God. There's not a bit of subtlety here. Then again this may be Allen's intention anyway. I think this is not a very well crafted film.Recently i viewed Stardust Memories and it works way better as a mature Woody Allen film"
2,The Stars Are For the Cinamatography,"You could watch just the first 5 minutes for the opening monologue and brilliant establishing shots of the city. It's gorgeous. That said, Allen's character's relationship with Hemingway's character is completely creepy. And the normally wonderful Keaton is forced to play an unlikable, neurotic, pretentious woman. There isn't the core of sweetness that I liked in Annie Hall. Maybe this is more realistic, but I hope not."
2,all-white stuttering misanthrope in black and white,"Does it bother anyone else that in what the director himself cals an ""idealized New York"" there are never any people of color? I'm talking about all of Woody Allen's films, not just this smug, prettily photographed, over-rated film. Wait, I've just been told that there is a black extra standing silently in the background of a party scene in Hannah and Her Sisters. I guess I'm wrong.Why are people so crazy for this nasty, self-absorbed hack?"
2,not that wonderful,"I was recommended this DVD. While I enjoy movies from the 1970's, I was disappointed in this one for some reason. I wish it were in color and the dialog was kind of rambling in parts. I found this hard to follow. I know this movie is rated high by most other people, but unless you love Woody Allen I would pass on this film."
5,Only one thing missing,"The sound.It's a DVD for heaven's sake.NO English Subtitles?What the Hell?Otherwise, beautiful."
5,no competition,"There is just no way for me to describe how great of a film this is. It is by far the best film Mr. Allen has made to date, others will argue but in the end come up short, and it is just pure magic. Yes that's how I'll describe it, magic."
5,Brilliant!,"Today, I was wandering the Woody Allen section in my local video store, and noticed that I have seen several Woody movies, but have never seen, what was told to me, to be his best film: Manhattan. So I rented it and was amazed by it. One aspect that held my interest was the camera work. The blue widescreen bars, and the black and white setting fit the film perfectly. So, in closing, I would recommend this to anyone who just hasn't seen it."
5,simply great,A really decent movie well deserving its reputation. Comes as a real shock after the deeply disappointing Match Point.
1,Manhattan - a defective DVD,"This is one of my all time favourite movies so I was thrilled when I received it as a Christmas gift. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that this is a defective disc. It plays for a few minutes and jumps back to the start. This happened evrytime I tried to watch it. Other discs play without a problem on my DVD player so the fault lies definitely with this disc. I do not have the packaging or the packing slip which I did not keep as I did noy expect a product received from Amazon to be of this poor quality. I don't know how to return it to Amazon in the absence of the packing slip. Please help. Sincerely, Mandakini Tata"
5,R.O.C.K. proves that Glenn is THE MAN!,"Glenn Hughes is probably one of the best vocalists that ever stepped foot in the business. For years he has been on top of his game, singing just as good now as he did decades ago. He may not scream like he used to,but one will not be disapointed for his incredibly soulful voice is stronger than ever. ""Crystal Karma"" is filled with great vocals and rockin' tunes. There is not one bad song on this CD and there is even a suprise instrumental track called ""Owed to J""(reminescent title of the Deep Purple song ""Owed to G"" on the Come Taste the Band album). If you get the bonus disk it may not be worth it.The song list is lame and the performance isn't that good. But,that would be a whole other review.So save your money and maybe just buy R.O.C.K. Trust me, You'll be satisfied. Also, if you want to spend some more money pick up ""VOODOO HILL"" which is even better. Glenn is on the whole thing and he gives his best performance since ""Feel"". Hope this is helpful."
4,"Strong CD,worthy of his legend","As a fan of his hard rock more than his soul/funk material,I have to say that this is a very interesting fusion of the two styles.It is very heavy,yet funky.Musically I would give it 5 stars.But it seems like he is holding back a little on the vocals,which is odd because his voice has lost NOTHING over the years.The live tracks prove this beyond all doubt.I would recommend this cd to any hughes fan.Anyone not familiar with him would be impressed by this piece of work"
1,if you want bass do not buy,I bought this with low expectations because of the price and still was very disappointed. I tried to hook it up every way they said and each time I got horrible results. I had 500 watts rms running to it and with the dual voice coils hooked up I couldnt get it over a 1/4 up with out it popping like it was blown. for me to get any volume to it I had to hook up just one voice coil unbridge my amp turn down all bass and everything. sounded like ok 6x9s not worth the money and no it wasnt blown amazon sent me another one exact same results. but the best part about my purchase is amazon replaced one and refunded my money with no questions asked. I will continue doing business with amazon knowing i can buy with confidence. thanks amazon
4,A fun game to start young children on,"My son received this for his third birthday and was really excited to play it. We had played a Barney memory game on CD that had a similar concept, so he was familiar with the idea. The game has a LOT of individual cards, which is pretty overwhelming for a 3-year-old. They are broken into four color-coded sets, and the instructions recommend starting with just one set for beginners. I highly recommend this since using too many cards to start with makes the game too long and frustrating for a 3-year-old. Maybe older kids can use the full set or multiple sets without getting bored. We both enjoyed playing and matching up the pairs of cards. He even beat me the first time we played! Although I had to keep reminding him that he could only turn over two cards at each turn. All in all, I think this is a good choice for a child just learning to play games and follow instructions, and is a good brain exercise as well."
5,The Finest Rock&Roll Film Ever Made,"Nothing can compare 2 Purple Rain. It is indeed the finest Rock&Roll film (starring a genuine artist, PRINCE) ever made. Purple Rain is Prince's baby in every aspect. This film was not conceived by and given 2 Prince by the hollywood/WB industry. The music is incomparable and the movie and the soundtrack have stood the test of time. A MUST SEE! I WATCH IT ONCE A WEEK."
4,Review and QUESTION!,"If someone could PLEASE respond and let me know if the disc came with a booklet or chapter sheet! My case was void of all but the 2 discs. I would have givin the disc 5 stars had the booklet been included. There's no doubt that effort was made in the quality of the picture and sound. The extras are certainly fun and bring you back to the good old purple days, but if Warner intentionally excluded the booklet...well, shame on them. Hence, the 4 stars instead of 5."
2,Worth a look for some of the bonus disk features,"I agree with many Amazon reviewers who say PURPLE RAIN was, when no one was singing, a dud. But this anniversary two-disk release is worth seeing for some of the stuff on the bonus D.V.D.. In particular, the M.T.V. PURPLE RAIN premiere footage features appearances and interviews with Little Richard, John Mellencamp, Eddie Murphy, Weird Al Yankovic, Sheila E. and Pee-Wee Herman. The M.T.V. host asks Eddie Murphy his opinion of PURPLE RAIN but Murphy dodges the question, saying he is such a Prince fan he liked it. Diplomatic of you, Eddie.The M.T.V. program also shows Prince Rogers Nelson for just a moment as he enters the party. Walking past the crowds and cameras, Prince says nothing. (One will note that ""Personality"" is a song Prince never sang.) But then, Prince may have chosen to say nothing rather than say we will like the movie.Make sure you read the February 13, 2000, review of PURPLE RAIN for a comprehensive summary of the film's flaws."
4,MORRIS DAY & JEROME AND THE MUSIC SHINES,"This movie was badly written, edited , for the most part terrible acting with the exception of Morris Day and his side kick Jerome Benton and all the great music ! made this movie a four star for me if it was on acting a lone it's gets 0 as well as for acting .."
3,"great music, shame about the movie!",sensational music and live performances are absolutely electrifying..........but the rest of the film is an absolute embarassment. Watching Prince cavorting around as The Kid is a cringe a minute experience.A truly abysmal film - worth watching for its sheer awfulness but also worth watching for the stunning musical performances.
5,Baby Baby Baby...What's it Gonna BE?,"If you don't love this movie I don't want to know you. People go on and on about ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Pretty in Pink."" Dennis Hopper. Blah blah blah. Molly Ringwald! Oh kiss my foot! I don't want to hear about Dennis or Molly. Look, I would like very much to colonize a planet only with people who love ""Purple Rain."" We would get it done! What is it? Name it. My favorite scene in the history of cinema is when Prince serenades Apollonia with ""The Beautiful Ones."" You watch that scene, baby, and if you don't see God you are blind."
4,Awesome on Blu Ray,"Just bought this not even knowing it was even available on Blu Ray and it has all that is included on the special edition DVD. The sound, the colors and the picture are great! But one down fall I was disappointed in was the music videos. There not in HD but just the original videos. Other than that you simply cant go wrong."
4,Good movie,I'm a huge Prince fan and this movie is a classic. The acting is not that great but you'll get over that because of the music!!!!
5,Prince is AWESOME!,"Not only does this movie entertain you with the great musice and voice of Prince, it has a bit of a love story to it. I highly recommend this movie to anybody, Prince fan or not..."
3,Great Special Edition DVD after 20 years.,"This release looks great compared to the previous fullscreen DVD. Colors are bright and the picture looks clear. On disc 2 theres a cool 1984 MTV Live at the Purple Rain opening show, which also plays the trailers & all the music videos. Then theres a collection of live performances, and a repeat of the same music videos shown in the MTV part. Its kind of redundant to repeat the music videos, but I guess they needed to fill the disc."
1,Try to get the german DVD,"This DVD doesn't contain the widescreen version (otherwise I would have rated it higher). I recommend the german DVD, as it's not only widescreen but anamorphic, too! It also features the english audio track (and subtitles)."
2,irritating ego trip,"I liked this when it first came out..I saw it when I was 13 years old. But this movie didn't age well--I saw it a couple of days ago and hated it. The whole, ""Stop beating Mom! What's wrong with 'the Kid?"" thing was hokey."
4,The end justifies the means,"OK, so it's a dismal premis for a movie. The main character is horrendously egocentric, and he beats his girlfriend. Not very happy. But, the music rocks! And, somehow I can't help but feel excited and pumped up at the end of the movie. Why did Baby I'm A Star never get extended airplay? The filming is pretty good for an 80's movie, and though the acting leaves a bit to be desired, it's pretty much par for the time, and above so for the genre.Regardless of whatever you may find slightly lacking, the feel at the end of the movie more than makes up for it. It's definitely worth adding to your video collection."
3,Mildly Interesting,"Although somewhat shallow this movie does have interesting moments. The best part is depicting the competition between Prince and Morris Day as they each try to make it big in the club scene. It is also inteersting how Prince's parents turbulent relationship shapes his self serving personality in the film. He finally realizes in the end that the world does not revolve around himself when he gives his two female band members a bit of a showcase for their song.It would have been nice for the characters to reveal themselves a bit more words and acting rather than just a collection fo songs. This really appears to be a video collection mroe than anything else. It is entertaining to a degree but there could be some more substance to the characters. In general, there is just enough to make this a middle of the road film."
2,Warner skimps on DVD treatment,"Great film, as everybody already knows, but the DVD is very disappointing. Maybe Warner can use the upcoming ""20th aniversary"" of the film as an excuse to put out a new and improved ""special edition."" There have to been many deleted scenes, because if you check out the trailer, there are a few clips in it that were not in the movie. Aside from that discovery, you should just keep your VHS copy for now."
1,Almost to horrid to describe,"After viewing this film, I think it's a miracle it didn't destroy Prince's career. The man can sing and dance, but an actor he is not! In fact, the only actors in this traffic accident of a movie are Morris Day and the guy that played The Kid's father, Clarence Williams III. And at best, Day is a comedien, not an actor. The only other good thing was the music, Purple Rain, When Doves Cry, etc. Otherwise, well, it's indescribable."
1,Crap seller,Ordered this for an x-mas gift seller contacted me a week before christmas and said item was out of stock. BUYER BEWARE
1,Disappointed,I never received the product and had to get a refund. A first since becoming a customer of amazon.
1,"and now, debuting in my list of the 10 worst movies ive ever seen ...","omigod, did this garbage really pass for ""hot"" 2 decades back? director albert magnoli has zero sense of pacing, editing, acting, story telling, etc. and prince is as bad an actor as ive ever seen. no, i take that back -- ive seen apollonia (who herein makes her role in ""falcon crest"" look like lilian gish)! i will not comment on the musical score; if you like it, more power to you and go buy the album. but a movie where clarence williams, III gives the strongest performance? well, thats not a movie i ever want to sit thru again."
1,Astonishment,"Thats the only word I can offer after seeing this movie. Astonishingly bad that is. From what I understand, Prince is actually a pretty nice guy with lots of musical talent, but this movie won't win him any nice guy points. Okay Seinfeld may have lampooned the ""Puffy Shirt"" but Prince seems to even sleep in them. His outfits are so flamey even Dennis Rodman would tell him ""tone it down homey"". The acting is at the quality level of your typical porno movie, and the script...well all I can say is there should be a death penalty for bad scriptwriting. The only notable exception is Morris Day, who can act! I actually liked Day and the music of his band ""The Time"" compared to Prince's wierd rock & roll funkadelic poopy music. The movie desperately wanted me to like Prince, but I was unshaken and never got to liking the little purple sprite, sorry....All in all, give it a miss. This is not a movie for watching, it is a movie for lying down, and avoiding."
5,Prince,I just wanted to say that I just love this movie and the man who is it who is prince he is so awesome great performer and actor he is unbelieveably talented it is his own right.
4,The Greatest Rock & Roll Movie Ever Made,"Backed by a first-class soundtrack, and filled with stunning choreography, biting humor & suprisingly passable acting, Purple Rain, like Prince's 2 movies to follow, has too long been dismissed as a mere 90 minute music video. A highly enjoyable movie from start to finish!"
5,Great Movie but NOT A SPECIAL EDITION,Warner Brothers made no effort to put together anything worthy of a special edition.For example the trailer contains 4 scenes that are not even in the movie. Those scenes are not to be found on the DVD. What is left is a cheap cut of the movie that is missing many parts that were edited out of the 1984 version.Deleted Scenes? None.Outtakes? None.Interviews? None.Directors Cut? None.How about the alt ending? Not even mentioned.How can this be called a 25th Anniversary Edition of one of the hottest music films ever made?
1,Download from Amazon is Terrible Quality!!,"If you're from the 80's and embraced your era, you'll love Purple Rain like you did the first time. But don't bother wasting your money on purchasing the download from Amazon because the quality looks like someone filmed it from a camera phone off of an old television set while the movie was playing from a 25-year-old VHS tape. It's absolutely the worst quality movie I've ever seen!"
3,pretty good but has aged,i used to like this film more back in the day.but it hasn't aged well.the music carried the film overall.Morris Day&Jerome Benton Stole the show.my favorite Prince film is Under the Cherry Moon.to me that's his most Honest.still it made it's point and was very important&influential.
1,Abysmal piece of crap!,"Thank you for granting me the privilege of watching Prince wallow in his ego for two hours. Two hours I'll never get back. When I watched this movie, my emotions ran from amusement, to boredom, to disgust and finally to rage. This is nothing more than an over-long commercial for Prince, and a monument to his colossal ego. Thank God for the ""bad guy"", Morris Day. He was the only likeable person in the movie. Clarence Williams III was also excellent, and way too good to be wasting his talent in this pap. Morris, Clarence, the throwing-the-babe-in the dumpster scene, and Apollonia's tits were the only things that relieved the excruciating torment of sitting through this bunk, an experience not unlike the Ludovico Technique scenes in ""A Clockwork Orange""."
1,Purple rain DVD,The main menu for the movie on this DVD is at the end of the movie. The only way to get to the main menu on this DVD is to play the movie
2,"Yeah, buddy, that's his own hair","I saw PURPLE RAIN in the movies when it first came out. All these years later, I can tell you the music has held up better than the motion picture itself. To watch PURPLE RAIN today, make sure your remote control has fresh batteries as you will want to fast-forward through the film's awkward, often dull story to reach the next super-charged concert song by Prince, the Time, and Apollonia 6.Too bad PURPLE RAIN did not settle on what by default was its most interesting non-musical aspect: the rivalry between the two bands that headline the local club. Instead, a romance that seems to blossom through slap-fighting and visits with a dysfunctional family in full bloom fighting distract from what might have been an engrossing battle of the bands.Last but not least, how come no one calls the police in the movies, even when a goon is throwing a woman in a garbage dumpster on a busy city street during the daytime?"
3,Full screen rots!,"When will WB release this film on widescreen? Will Warner ever stop sticking it to the artists they sign like Prince, Devo, etc.? Don't buy it until they release it the way it should be!"
3,A lot of good Prince music,"""Purple Rain"" has a lot of good Prince music and a sexy female lead who looks very good on Blu-ray. ""Purple Rain"" is primarily a showcase for Prince's music and female lead Apollonia Kotero's breasts. Prince and his band perform a lot of songs on stage, and Apollonia wears a lot of low cut outfits and even goes topless for a second or two. In between the songs, there's a melodramatic story and amateurish acting, but it's mildly amusing rather than annoying. Prince himself is rather laughable as a brooding and tortured artist who wears a lot of pretty clothes and takes himself far too seriously (watch 'An Evening with Kevin Smith' for the great story of Smith spending time with Prince). The Blu-ray disc has a lot of low resolution music videos as extras, and I was very glad to be able to watch again the video for ""When Doves Cry"". Reviewed 4/5/2009 after watching on Blu-ray."
5,Great,"The way this old movie was digitally remastered was GREAT! Superior image and sound quality to match a great movie, love it!!"
2,dvd is a 2 movie is a 4,"again I didn't read the box before buying this one, in it goes to the dvd player and WOW!...it'll stay in the collection until a non-modified from its original version is released...when will people learn, widescreen is the way the director intended the movie to be seen?!?"
1,"Buy the soundtrack, Skip the movie","Silly melodrama even by t.v. soap opera standards, the only thing ""Purple Rain"" has to offer is the sight of Prince performing his own material. You'd do better to purchase the fabulous soundtrack or a video anthology of Prince's music videos."
2,For Prince Fans Only,"I just watched this movie (more than 25 years after it premiered). The plot, acting, etc., are lame. This is a ""movie"" that only Prince fans would like. I'm not a fan nor do I dislike him, so I was somewhat of an objective audience and this really is a lame ""movie."" So what if it's semi-autobiographical, it's a lame semi-autobiographical ""movie."" It really is just an extended series of Prince Music Videos. Nothing more, nothing less."
4,Bonus CD should have been the Concert !,"Movie and DVD quality of picture and sound are awesome. My complaint is for the 20th anniversary this DVD bonus disk 2 should have been the Prince and the Revolution Live (1985) concert, which is currently available only on VHS. If they had included this as the ""bonus"" disk 2, it would have been perfect. That would make a great set, and I can't believe they did not do that!"
1,Fullscreen.,"Certainly it is up to the purchaser to read all the details. So it is my fault that I purchased an inferior product. But, I feel that I should warn others. This is fullscreen. It looks horrible on widescreen tvs. Be warned."
3,"Love Prince, Hate the ""Anniversary"" set","I was very disappointed to see that this so called ""anniversary"" set didn't include deleted scenes!! I was hoping to see the entire movie as intended by its directors...Boy was I disappointed! While the extras were ok (i.e.,comments, MTV ""after party"", etc.), there were some scenes in the trailer that I was hoping to see in the full length feature. I don't know what to say about this ""new edition"". In fact it's not new at all. It's the same ol' stuff that I've been watching on cable for the past 20 yrs.How could they let Prince's fans down like that!!!"
4,Good Blu-ray release but too many SD features,I didn't expect the quality to be great with this film but it was not bad. My main complaint with the BD release is that the music videos were not remastered into HD quality! What's the point then?As for the movie? Classic. Love Purple Rain.
4,Purple Rain HDDVD,"Us Gen-Xers were big fans of Prince ""back in the day"" and I still love this movie. The entire soundtrack is one hit after another. The movie is kind of corny but still works. Appolonia(sp?) never looked better! 8) The transfer is great considering the film source wasn't that amazing to begin with. I bought this mainly for the Dolby True HD soundtrack and I have to say it was a little heavy in the surrounds but still sounds good. It is much, much better than the SDDVD. I have a combo Blu/HDDVD player so buying the HDDVD is no big deal for me, but a deal breaker if you don't have the right player. I'm glad I bought this, but wouldn't reccommend it for more than $12 considering HDDVD is gone."
4,"Great music, Prince at his best.","My children made me watch this movie in the early eighties and I have been stuck on it ever since. I like the music and the story. The actings is not the best but it's not bad, that's the reason for only four stars."
5,Love It,"The best movie ever. This is a great addition if you are a Prince fan or not. The movie itself has amazing music and of course the best artist ever...Prince. This movie will have you singing all the songs. The product arrived in perfect condition. And the price was amazing. I always wanted to own this movie, but I could never find it in stores. I just so happened to find it on Amazon and ordered it immediatley. You must own this classic."
2,"Action Packed, Dynamic Breathtaking","This story takes place in Minneapolis in a strange club where people dress up like walking manniquins, now I know why Jesse the Body Ventura walked around in a Boa, it just looked normal, sort of Lumberjack look, Anyway Prince plays a struggliing musician who is the main attraction at this Night Club, Enter Appolonia Kotera, and now she has to make up her mind to be with a kook like Prince or fall into the loving arms of Morris Day and the time. And please a yellow Cadillac as his personal Limo. Hey girls I think a guy in a Gray Ford truck would be a better bet for you. The two compete only for prince to get his strengh back, to survive the self gun shot wound to his father and his abused mother and not only win his girlfriend back but the Night Club audience"
1,Horrifying,"This may be the very worst book I have read in my 37 years. Stuffed with linguistic fluff and stylistic errors, and short on ideas and evidence, the book reads like a map of the capitalist, Christian fundamentalist, anti-intellectual U.S. mind. Covey claims to base his book on ""objective"" principles that transcend all time and places, yet these principles, whose universality he fails to document, are little more than figments of his personal worldview--""potential,"" ""growth,"" ""quality,"" and so on. Most telling is Covey's terminology and ranking of ""private victory"" before ""public victory."" This happens to be the same rhetoric that has justified U.S. and European conquests of ""uncivilized"" peoples over the last few hundred years. No, this is no Bible of leadership or management. Anyone looking for a well-written work on these topics should check out Kouzes and Posner's Leadership Challenge. Covey doesn't deserve a dime of the millions he's made by pimping this cultural trash."
3,Powerful information but tough if you don't have an MBA,"Since I felt like I was the last person in America that had not read this classic I jumped in last month. Superb information, plenty of thought provoking moments but for me surrounded by academic ga ga instead of real business world thoughts. Worth it for the info but boy tough to enjoy.John Gregory VincentPresident - Genesis Consulting Group LLCwww.johngvincent.com"
1,challengedonlinebuyer,"This review has only a negative reflection on myself but I would like to make aware of my mistake. I ordered 2 books online and the one in question I received turned out to be a miniature copy which is about a 2 x 2 book and I was too devastated to even try returning and reordering so I have it as a cautious reminder as to why I am leery when buying online.Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Miniature Edition"
4,Great book on Self-help,"Peter Teiman Franklin here,Great book on self-management.Peter Teiman FranklinSweden"
1,YOU'RE NOT LDS? THEN YOU ARE AN OUTSIDER,"Mr. Covey's book seems all nice & good but, the path to HELL is paved with good intentions. Meanwhile, back at the ""LDS Ranch"" their little followers discriminate against middle aged single women in the workplace--apparently, they prefer bare-foot & pregnant types--I know this because I've experienced doors slammed in my face by a myriad of their LDS-run companies. MR. Covey should write a book addressed to his fellow LDS ""sheeple"" on how to treat ""outsiders"" with respect--otherwise, their lies & cult behaviour will be more & more exposed & will only send them to their demise (ask a Catholic priest!!)."
1,Read the bible instead!,"Steven Covey, although he is exceptionally talented at writing, among other things, is a Mormon. Mormons believe so many things that contradict what Jesus taught. If you are a Christian and are looking for direction, please go to the Bible. The bible will help you find the habits to make you an effective and happy person. Man may write in words that are easier for you to read, but that is all they are, easier to read.If you want to find out what Mr. Covey REALLY believes I challenge you to read Mormonism Unmasked."
4,Must Read and Re-read Book,"It is one of the best books by far on self-development. I bought more copies for my siblings and recommended it to friends and several others.You will find yourself inside this book. You will come to understand why you are the way you are or why you act/react the way you do. On this book, I have have summarized lines and paragraphs to one word - my name.Read this book and come to know yourself better."
5,Offers Many Things to Everyone,I read this book initially some 10 years ago. I've reread it a couple of times and now I buy copies and give to my friends. I believe people get different things out of this book based upon where they are in life. The most significant thing I gained is the appreciation that the only thing I can have complete control over is how I interact with people and the situations I share with them.
4,Practical Wisdom,"Books similar to the seven habits I typical find to be useless. If we can't learn how to live by following the examples of others or reading great literture, then why attempt to learn from a self-help book. The seven habits is much more then mere self help. In clear terms Covey outlines the make up of a successful person. This is not didactic gibberish, but practical wisdom that many should heed. Definitely the best of its kind."
4,Helpful & Informative!,"This CD/Book is chock-full of practical advice & information for the person who is personally disorganized, & in need of help in all kinds of work situations. There's a lot of information to think about & register in your mind, so I suggest as you listen to the CD, make sure you have a pen & notebook handy to take notes--you'll need to in order to remember key, pertinent parts, & also, you'll want to reflect back, & memorize the info. given. I also suggest that you take frequent breaks to make sure you understand what you've heard, to just stop & think about what he just said, to re-listen to important points he makes to make sure you're following & ""getting it"". There's no way to lose listening to the practical advice, views, hints, & strategies given, & I highly recommend for every corporate employee, no matter what your ""rung"" on the ladder."
3,Interesting,"This book is interesting. It does give you ""assignments"" that are helpful if you do them but can be rather lengthy if you do them exactly as instructed. I find the book somewhat frustrating to read because of the amount of ""buy-in"" to the philosophies introduced in order to effectively interpret the book. Maybe this frustration is because I'm reading it while on holiday and would really rather be reading a good bit of fiction."
3,Pretty good book,"This book contains a few useful recommendations. The only problem is that if you’re not naturally inclined to behave the way “highly effective people” do, it’s going to be really difficult to use the author’s advice. There’s one book that’s been recently published, Secret Techniques for Controlling Sadness, Anger, Fear, Anxiety, and Other Emotions by Vlad Koros, and it teaches how to adjust any character traits that don’t let you behave the way you want or need. In my opinion, these two book work very well together, if you’re serious about changing your habits for better."
5,Enlightening,I believe the seven habits would be most effective in the school system. Fundamental truths to be planted in the minds of the youth.
2,THIS BOOK IS OVERRATED!!,"I just finished reading this book, and have to say it was a serious let-down in light of the reviews. Let me save you some time and money: 1) You are responsible for your own life, so do something about it. 2) Make a plan for yourself. 3) Focus on what's important. 3)You reap what you sow--so sow well. 4)Seek mutually beneficial relationships. 5) Have empathy and be considerate to others. 6)Be cooperative. 7) Take care of yourself--mind, body, and soul. ----Ground-breaking stuff, isn't it?!?! Mr. Covey is a wealthy man for this?! Hmmmmmmm."
1,Not What It Seems.,This is a minature edition that could fit into your frontpocket. Those of you looking to by this great book cheap; don't befooled. This should be listed as a novelty item. Not as an hardboundbook...
1,How many books can this guy write about the obvious?,I can't believe the reviews for this book. I wasn't presented with anything new or thought-provoking. The only thing I can assume is that those who find this book to be thoughtful must live very sheltered lives!
1,Buy the Book,"Buy the book and avoid the audio CD. Good principles but delivery of the narrator is flat and monotone. The musical interludes between topics are annoying. The pace of the narration is too slow. The best excerpt is a live recording of Stephen Covey at a presentation, many others are tedious.The book is a quick and valuable read, the audio CD is too long and ponderous."
1,Oh pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeze!,"Stephen Covey has gone way over board. This book is pretentious, complicated and exclusionary. Just say it! Four quadrants, seven habits. . .blah, blah, blah. He makes life management way too complicated and his ideas are too abstract and do not ""connect"" with each other. If you want an ""technical"" book on the ""concept"" of life management, this is your book. If you want a practical ""life"" management book that's easy to understand and apply, try ""The 10 Natural Laws of Successful Time and Life Management"" by Hyrum Smith."
1,Isn't it all just common sense?,"I am amazed and how ""helpful"" people find this book. The only thing worse than this text is the 3 day course that accompanies it if you are subjected to such evils by your employer. My advise is take the time that it takes to read this book and ""sharpen your saw"" the old-fashioned way... live a little! I'm sorry that I had to give this book one star... zero stars was not an option."
1,Seven painful habits,"From the hype, I thought that this book would be somehow enlightening or at least entertaining.... but seriously....if I could have awarded less than 1 star I could at least attribute some form of enjoyment to the task... alas reading ""The 7 Habits"" was only slightly more enjoyable than slowly sticking blunt pins in my eyes!!The 7 actual habits could have been summarised in 2 pages, including the diagrams, talk about drawnout!!I would suggest to anyone contemplating aquisition of this book just call me, you can have my copy."
2,"A bloated, overwritten book","After reading the introduction and first chapter of this book, I closed it and took it back to the library. I never got comfortable with the author's writing style. The book is much longer than it needs to be. The author spends a lot of time reaching main ideas and mostly lectures rather than teaches and explains. This would have been a good long-form essay but it doesn't work as a book. Additionally, the author makes the content more complicated than it needs to be. He turned the compelling into the obtuse. It is unfortunate that he did not employ a ghostwriter."
4,Still effective,"This book is a classic, that is responsible for changing a number of lives. The concepts are still very much effective. A must read for anyone who wishes to really understand how simple behavioral changes can have a dramatic and life-changing influence on the quality of lifeThe Cheapest, Quickest and Safest Way to have Unlimited Energy."
3,My opinion of this book.,"I decided to read 7 habits after being introduced to the concepts in a career planning course. Basically I will tell anyone who buys this book you are wasting your money... Why you ask? Very simply put- you can figure the concepts out on your own or just browse through the book and see that it is all common sense. My #1 disagreement with the author is the whole concept of cooperation in the workplace, etc.. That is great if you live in a fantasy world, but most likely you won't see it as reality...7 habits is a great conversation piece and will serve as a great coffee cup coaster... If this book works for you, more power to you."
1,Poor description,I bought what I thought was a book. Because in the description it says nothing about being an audio book. Which would have been fine only if the audio wasn't on cassette tape! I don't own any device to play these anymore. So I say poor description. Still looking for the book.....
1,misleading,This is so small...cannot even read it! This is not a full size book ...note the size of this book.
2,stupid book,"I was required to read this for school. The book was used and was in okay condition. Honestly a well taught person knows this stuff so don't buy it. If you're a bum, buy this book"
3,Overly complicating simple ideas.,"I have found the book hard to read because of how he explains each habit in soo many more pages than he needs too. He overly complicates easy ideas that could be explained in a lot less pages. I have made it halfway through the book and I have to say, I don't know if I am going to finish it because it is boring me to death."
2,Not bad,This book is not all that great. Difficult to apply in real life. I once took this class and never implemented
4,One book out of top 5 of all time!,"What can one say that hasn't been said? This is a classic read and stands on its own as one of the all-time classics in this particular genre. In my opinion there are only a half dozen or so success based books required for your personal library, and this is one of them! Well worth reading."
5,"Very High Thinking methods , an investment worth every penny","what this book does is to bring out the best in people in a gradual sence, consentraiting on inner personality rather than phisycal apperance. In another word valuable tip for a better more meaningful life."
5,Excellent help!,"7 Habits should be required reading for all parents, teachers and executives. It's the kind of straight-forward common sense that rings true much like another book -- The Lone Ranger's Code of the West."
5,The Best Success Book Ever,I have read countless success books. This one is unique and effective. This is your bible.J~
5,Bible of all Self Help books,"I got this book as a gift from my friend who knew i was into self help books.I was told that i may find what i read in this book in other books but not the other way...In fact this is the best Self help book i ever read. Its not a book ,u read and forget ,its something you read often and try to implement in your daily life to be successful."
4,a great resource for lifetime,"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Peoplethis is a great book. I have to read it for one of my classes, butI am really glad I got assigned to read it.It is a great resource of knowledge that could help one throughouttheir whole life.I strongly recommend it!"
2,Read this before you buy,"I bought this CD thinking I was getting the entire book in audio format. However, what I got was a speech by the author (apparently in front of some kind of audience) on some of the principles from his book. Not a complete waste of money, but disappointing if you are expecting the entire book."
3,good lessons but too long,"Habit 3 (""Put first things first"") and Habit 5 (""Seek first to understand, then to be understood"") are the most useful lessons from the book. The book is far too long and far too theoretical. Having a quick look at the table of contents is sufficient to get the basic idea of the book; no need to buy one or to read all of the 350 pages."
5,Very Positive,"all i can say is that this book will teach you about yourself and everyone else in a very positive way. If you read it, you will thank yourself. i have recommended the book to everyone i know, as well as making everyone in my family read it. If you ever had doubts, or questions about yourself or anyone you know, or work, or people, this book will help you see what the answers are to any of those questions, uncertainties you ever had.it is very detailed, with lots of examples and personal experiences from the author. The book is meant to give you guidence, and help you see ""things"" from different angels. a great self-awarness piece of literature."
1,A Ultimate source for people who enjoy reading B.S.,"The author of the book is undoubtedly a great story taller, his ability to make some basic common senses in to a 300+ page big book is outstanding. However, most of the stuff in his book are pointless garbage, full of BS. A excellent reference book for BS person. You can talk about personal change all day long and all night long but you will never get anyting if your don't act. Don't waste you time reading this book, keep you mind open and your hand working, live by your common senses ultimately you will be a highly effective people. Believe me!"
3,THE ANECDOTES ARE WORTH IT,"The caption for my review aptly sums up all my thoughts about this ubiquitous bestseller. If you hail from the 'effective people' camp, then consider getting this book from second hand stores; it seems rather easy to find and usually in a good condition as owners are apparently wise enough to give it no more than a skim before letting go of it."
1,7 Habits of Highly Effective People,"The product I received was not good at all. For an audio book, they put 2 copies of the first CD, yet had them labled 1, 2, and 3. It was not a good buy, would rather get it brand new than used."
1,patronizing and disturbing,"When Covey gives example situations of codependency, which he does alarmingly often, it is always from the _first person_. Don't listen to everything he says because he berates both himself and the reader throughout the book."
1,Insipid,"If you managed to be conscious while growing up and had the benefit of parents and other role models who were even mildly interested in seeing you become a healthy and functioning adult, you already know everything in this book. It's annoying to have common sense pearls presented as if they are groundbreaking insights... and even more annoying to have paid for the displeasure."
2,Saving Time by Getting Off the Bus,"I took the 1-day Franklin Covey time management class 20 years ago, and have bought the day planners ever since. It's kind of a racket, really. OCD Mormons with nothing better to do than be hyperorganized. I probably would have continued, except when I ordered my refill this year, THEY CHARGED TAX ON THE SHIPPING AND HANDLING!!!! Apparently this is legal....but still not cool. So, I'm getting off the Franklin Covey OCD bus this year. They made a buck or so extra off me this year....but lost a customer in the process. Too bad for them!!"
3,it's a little small,"Ok, great book, read it twice already and I'm ready to start implementing these ideas into my everyday life. I do, however, have a complaint, and it's not about the book, but about the way it's presented. I had no idea when I placed my order that this book measured 2 inches by 2 inches. It was described as a hardback, and, well, i guess it is, but it's an awfully tiny hardback. Some clarification needs to be made on the site here."
4,Good basic Information,"Covey counts on people having the knowledge on how to apply his habits, but overall the advice is sound. Despite sounding a bit like a cult leader at times (I actually took the class that accompanies this book) he genuinely believes in his theories. Translating the habits into daily activity takes effort, but once done, positive change will happen.The writing is easy to understand and is well organized, and each chapter takes the time to explain its habit, which makes the book an easy read."
5,A Quality Book,Stephen Covey has written a book allowing readers to have perspective on life that will help people face any challenge. It is an internal structure brought forth in this manuscript giving the reader tools to find centeredness in the midst of even despair. I think you will find Stephen's insights to be very universal in nature and the experience of a man who has found wisdom in a creative order inside us all.I also recommend: A Life in Review by Sam Oliver
3,"Nice abstract, but lacking examples","While Dr. Covey manages to clearly communicate the core principles of the ""7 Habits"" in this abridged version, the lack of examples might negatively affect the listener's ability to quickly apply the underlying principles in day to day business situations.Therefore I recommend to listeners with a business focus to spend a few dollars more and invest in the unabridged version.If you're looking for an easy to understand version of the ""7 Habits"" that can be readily applied in day-to-day life, take a look at ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Families"" instead."
1,"Thank you, Captain Obvious",Do people seriously need to be told that they need to practice these habits? Go for a win-win outcome? Be proactive? Seriously? Don't expect anything life-changing in this book. It's feel-good fluff from cover to cover and breaks absolutely no ground.
1,Self-Help for Dummies,"I'm ordinarily wary of books like this that promise to transform your life within the span of 300 pages, but I figured 10 million readers (as the cover states) can't be wrong.I pray I'm never trapped in an elevator with any of them.After trudging through Covey's scary, cultish gobblygook, I have to wonder, ""Are people so desperate for guidance that they actually believe this garbage."" The book is about as insightful as my dog and about as deep as an episode of Jenny Jones. When a follower complains to Covey that his marriage is over, Covey recommends (over and over) that the man ""love her."" Wow, why didn't I think of that.Ever see ""Being There"", with Peter Sellers? I'm betting Covey and Sellers have a lot in common."
2,Audio is not as good as the book,I think the book is excellent. It's a basic approach and I have read it several times. I made a mistake when purchasing the CD. The abridged edition just does not convey the messages as well as the book. I am going to try the unabridged edition. Save your money on this audio product.
3,Sounded Good....,"I was all excited, hum, motivated when I ordered this. And while it does contain some good rah,rah motivation, I just never had the kumbaya feeling. At least it motivated me to write a review, albeit, about a year late. So maybe I'm not as effective as I thought I was. Good luck."
3,"Some excellent ideas, but too wordy","I quite liked the audio version of this book, but I don't think that the book added much - the habits themselves are good ones to adopt, but the book surrounds them with so much wordage and over-explanation that the overall message got lost somewhat. My advice would be to stick to the tape, and that, if you're going to read the book at all, do so selectively."
5,No other book has had a stronger impact on me so far,"If you read this book at the right time of your thought development, it will change dramatically the way you look at yourself, the way you look at others, the way you live your life, what you think you can do. Many books are deep, this one can transfer its depth onto you in a very effective way."
4,A Wonderful Book,"People who live their lives effectively are those who are focused and this book tells you how to focus your life. It is all inclusive in that it includes social, spiritual, and family aspects in addition to work. Covey says he became interested in how perceptions influenced the actions of people. The seven habits grows out of this internal worldview, i.e., that people act based on what they think. Habits are powerful forces. Some are by default, but this book instructs readers in how to control the habits that will determine their destines.Developing relationships with other people is a vital issue he addresses in this discussion. He talks about gaining personal, private victory before one advances to public, recognizable accomplishment.There is a lot of solid, insightful, practical wisdom in this well-written book. I highly recommend it as it will improve your thought life and help you to focus on doing things based on significance, not just arbitrarily exist."
4,A very helpful book,"This book speaks truth. Everyone, no matter what level you are at, could learn something about living more successfully by reading this book. The Seven habits are so natural and true that I smacked myself on the head a couple (more than a couple actually) of times while reading this book. Over and over Covey stated things I already knew deep down, but had never thought of in the particular and perfect way that he phrased it. I am in a group that has been studying books that we believe will help us live more effectively. This book is the best secular one we have read. I recommend it."
2,A Band-Aid Solution,"I was tempted to rate this book with no stars before I thought of how many people have told me how beneficial this book has been to them. If you are a person who enjoys self-help books, this might be worthwhile. A few of the concepts were applicable to my life, but the basic ideas could have been summed up easily in 50 pages. The rest of the book is repetitive. The book is a constant contradiction to the concepts it preaches. Covey repeatedly condemns the band-aid solution to a problem while at the same time suggesting that by reading a book people can solve the problems of their lives, this in itself seems to be a band-aid solution. Preaching is an appropriate term to describe this book. If you enjoy others telling you how to live your life, not to center yourself around your family or to constantly visualize your own death, this is a must have book."
3,I've heard Covey speak on this book.....,"The book, no matter what your opinion is of it, can never be as bad as sitting through Mr. Covey's lecture about it."
4,For all the disappointed souls !!,"After reading this book and then the reviews, I have summarized all your disappointments. The gripe I keep hearing is that ""Covey's"" book is so basic !! Undoubtedly it is pretty obvious, but that is exactly what he was trying to do, point out the obvious!! Many of us seem to look for a ""quick fix"" but if your life was that simple you wouldn't need a book!! One thing Covey stresses throughout the book is that, There is no ""quick fix"" to life, just common principles that bind some of the most successful people together. That is what separates the haves and the have nots!!"
3,Not as excellent as is made to be...,"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective people has introduced a number of new words into our lexicon: paradigm-shift, Win-Win (which Covey did not create, but popularized), and synergy. However, the book itself is overhyped, and is certainly not that powerful. Covey writes incessantly about the life-changing effects of the seven habits, but they are moderately helpful techniques for living. Perhaps the best book on a similar subject, principle-centered living, is the Road Less Traveled. It's a timeless volume by M. Scott Peck. I suggest reading it in any diet of ""mental health"" literature. Still, kudos to anyone reading these books; it means you want to learn. That will happen, but not by reading Covey."
3,Need more ways to comment.,"If you are having time-management problems, this book will definitely help you. The rest of it...meh. If you are having problems with people not liking you, read Dale Carnegie. If you are seeking meaning in your life, read The Sermon on the Mount.NOTE:This book is the kind that really brings out the trolls who muck up the reviews. 25% of the reviews of this book are actually reviews. The remaining 75% are synopses, fanboy gushes and hater flames. Potential purchasers waste too much time having to sift through ""reviews"" figuring out which reviews are actually reviews and which are summaries, fanboy kisses and hater grenades. Please Amazon.com upgrade your customer review process."
3,The seven Habits,"Stephen Covey describes in details the seven habits necessary to be highly effective. He addresses issues like time management, basing a life on principles and prioritizing weekly tasks. The information is easy to understand and most people should be able to apply it successfully in their lives. The book contains exercises for individuals and examples of how these seven habits have been applied in the lives of other people.John M. Vanderslice"
4,Self-improvement based on personal integrity--great concept.,"I recommend this book to every one I know. It starts from personal integrity and works from there. It offers a method that works both in the home and work. This is not a book for those who want a quick fix. Step by step it shows how to examine your day to day decisions and how to set and focus on your goals. It does not say focus on one aspect of your life while you ignore another aspect. It shows how to base your decisions, taking your whole life --Work, family, spritual--into account.I liked it so much I started reading ""Seven Habits of Highly Effective Teenagers"" for my 15 year old daughter. Sometimes, the book does get a little tedious. When it does become tedious, I then read the corresponding chapeter in the ""Effective Teenagers"" book.I find I'm making better decisions (especially the minor ones) and my life slowly becoming more organized as I follow each chapter."
3,Not a quick fix,"I felt that this was a good book if you were a dedicated soul. This is truly not a quick fix. It takes serious self analysis before you even get to the first habit. If you are afraid of what you do not know about yourself, then perhaps this wouldn't be the book for you. However, if you are comfortable with yourself and you know what needs improvement within your life and the way you handle it, then perhaps this is the book for you. I liked it because its relevant in more than one aspect of life. You can use the paradigm in relationship, business transactions, as well as parenting. In order to get the book to work for you, you must walk into with your eyes wide open and understand that change is not always comfortable and will take dedication and patience to overcome."
2,A Disappointment,"For all the hype this program generates I must say that I am truely disappointed by the quality of this CD. In this CD (with the blue cover) you are constantly interrupted during Covey's interesting seminar, by a woman narrator who talks about what Covey is getting ready to talk about. I felt like I was back in grade school having the book deciphered into ""potato head"" talk. I will try another version of this book in hopes that it was put together in a better, easier flowing manner."
5,Keys to Effectiveness,"This great book by Stephen Covey shows you the keys to effectiveness. While many people are busy being efficient, they are not usually effective. Covey teaches many valuable precepts to becoming a highly effective person in any walk of life. Great book. Highly recommended."
1,Bilge for Losers,"Pages and pages of tedious psychobable, with no scientific evidence except the inevitable anecdotes.The fact that 5,000,000 people bought and at least partially read this book makes one laugh or cry, depending on how highly effective is your sense of humour..."
2,Tedious,"Tedious, overcomplicated book that could and should have been cut in half. Not very useful and there are 100 other books out there much more useful."
1,MICROSCOPIC BOOK,I received this book and thought it was a joke. The book is smaller than a pack of cig's. The binding is so poor I was afraid to open it more than once for fear the pages would fall out. I can't comment on the written content due to the fore mentioned reason. I immediately returned it for a refund.
2,Overlong and unoriginal...,"Save your money and buy Dale Carnegie's books. They are coincise, easy to read and packed with a huge amount of invaluable information."
1,Barf!,"This book was highly recommended to me by a man I later broke up with which should have been a clue right there.I couldn't make it through the first chapter of this book without getting a headache largely due to Mr. Covey's unbearable mangling of the English language.Covey should have first taken a course in the ""Seven Habits of Highly Effective WRITING"" before crafting this tedious read.My suggestion? Don't waste your money. Read the classics read, the writings of Marcus Aurelius, read ANYTHING, but this."
1,Buy another book,"This book is all about generality. It has ideas like take your life into your own hands, don't let life drive you.But it doesn't tell you how to do it.For instance if I tell you Be a great basketball player, that's not a habit. You have to do several smaller steps to become one, which the book doesn't tell you.It's also not motivating.If you want a good book, read the ""magic of thinking big""However, be aware, no book can change your life, like many reviewers say. Only you can change it."
5,Ace supplier,"The book was in as-described condition. Delivery was faster than expected. I received the book in only a few days. The cost was moderate for a used book, but low for one in demand as this one is."
5,My Favorite Book,"By far, this is my favorite book, on paper and e-paper. It's been a great joy to read this book, again and again and again."
2,Unhappy with quality,"The jacket looked old and faded, the inside pages had highlighting throughout. Unhappy since i thought i was getting a like new book! Would not purchase from this seller again."
4,Comments...,"I think this is a good book to read. Not everything in this book works for me but I can use some of the things mentioned in this book. I understand ideas in this book may go against some 'traditional' believes or whatever you want to call it. This book doesn't teach you how to be a 'complete' person. If you think this book teaches you how to take advantage of other people or deceive them for your own gain, well, maybe you should read a book with a title ""How to think positively"" or ""How to be a good person in society"" as a prerequisite? Is this book perfect for everyone? NO. Does this book work for everyone? NO. If the ideas in this book work for you and makes your life better and makes you happier, who cares where the idea in the book comes from?"
1,Aren't I wonderful and smart?,Stephen Covey likes himself more than I could stand. I tossed the book aside after a few chapters and haven't missed it since.
5,The Law of the Harvest Holds True,"This book has changed a lot of lives. I teach the Seven Habits to other people who ask me how I have managed to do many of the things I have, and still balance work, family, etc. Covey proposes sound, down-to-earth principles for achieving happiness, success, and managing ""yourself"" in time.A lot of people, accustomed to those ""quick fix"" programs, find that they work no better than the quick weight loss, fad diets. You think you are doing great, for a short time, then you begin encountering hurdles. This book is a let-down for people who have become addicted to such short-term thinking. With patience, periodic review of the 7-Habits book, and determination, you can change your life.Covey never said he would do it for you. But he has produced a great tool for helping you put it all into perspective."
5,Common sense very uncommon- can enrich you every way,"This book is common sense very uncommon, and when practiced can make you happy and wealthy. A book written by Subhankar Ray applied these principles in the stock market, which I found very useful in becoming an effective investor.Beyond financial growth, emotional, physical and spritual growths are also key to success as mentioned in the book."
3,OK,Good information but the book does not seem to hold my reading interest. Puts me to sleep - that may be a good thing.
5,great book,"good advice. hard to implement, but bought book to remind me to keep trying. I really like the concepts presented."
3,The Multiple Clichés of Highly Over-Hyped Books,"Seven simplistic lessons for personal effectiveness. This type of content should be taught to teenagers inexperienced in life. As an adult I find it a fairly mundain attempt at creating content for a highly marketable title. There's certainly good information in each ""habit"" and I'm not denying that this is an interesting book with useful tips, but the lessons are just too purile to gain credibility amongst the sagacious.The weak point of the book is it's failure actually to cite any research which shows that these are common habits of effective people, or that they may be differentiating habits. Instead, Covey choses marketability over credibility.It's definitely not essential reading, but worth borrowing from a library, or a friend to skim-read."
5,Covey Got My Attention From The Get-Go,"I received this book when a company for which I worked hired the Covey team to teach the three-day Seven Habits seminar as a component of employee professional development -- and I have returned to the book several times since that class, to keep the experience fresh.Portions of the class consisted of Stephen Covey videotape lectures. The very first one told me this guy meant business, and that he and I had similar views of the world. Covey said something to the effect of the following:Be proactive, take charge of your own life. What about a guy who tells you, ""I can't make any decisions this month. I'm an Aquarious, and my horoscope says I'm not supposed to make any decisions this month."" Are you going to extend any credibility to a FLAKE like that?!Stephen Covey properly calls a flake a flake. He definitely has his head on correctly."
1,"5 stars for the marketing behind it, but ...","... I'm afraid I found little of the value I'd hoped to find. It was badly written (too many unnecessary words), but that didn't mean I wouldn't find useful advice.I suppose I did find useful advice, except it was hidden in a froth of words. It could have been pared down to a tenth of its size. Life is too short--this book is too long.Perhaps making it a certain size, with a certain number of pages was part of the marketing gimmickry."
1,Vastly overrated pablum,"Mormon bromides, old saws. Why all the hype? Work hard. Follow the Golden Rule. You mustoughtshould plan ahead. Duh. It's also a very individualistic, self-centered book. The only worthwhile part is the calendar, but even that lost its appeal when it was marketed in office supply stores as a Big Deal That Will Revolutionize Your Life.Buy a Bible instead. Cultivate a hobby. Volunteer. Any of these will do you infinitely more good than this mush."
1,Beware: Psycho-babbler at work,"There's really no point in writing a lengthy review about a book as naff as this. So here, instead, are two snippets which seem to me to sum up the whole spirit and content of this SERIOUSLY OVER-RATED book:On pages 86-88 we are told that we must all be proactive, because being proactive is better than anything. Particularly if your boss is an ignorant tyrant - in which case you should proactively start sucking up to him before anyone else gets in as No. 1 ""yes"" man.You should also learn to practise emotional blackmail wherever you can. Treat other people nicely, so that they always ""owe you one"", especially your friends and relations (Covey calls this creating an ""emotional bank account""!) (pp.188-202).So, if that's your idea of how a ""successful"" person would behave, then this may be the book for you.If you're aiming for something with rather more integrity, however, then I'd recommend that you avoid this book like the plague."
1,Insulting,"This book is an insult to people who do honest work in psychotherapy.This book is catered towards people who do not want to put the time and effort into changing their life. Life is difficult, yes but there are no easy answers. I would rate Dr. Covey as the second-worst author on the market (Next to Dr. Laura) for this reason - life is about the process, not about outcomes and by just focusing on what your want your life to be like wihout focusing on the work to get there, you'll never get there."
5,A Classic that will Transform your Life!!,"Covey's book is a classic and the will truely transform your life. How? Success is determined by your habits, the routines that make up your lifestyle. Once you change your habits or add new good ones you are automatically on course to a more successful life. I also highly recommend another book that just came out called ""The Power of Positive Habits""...this book shows you how to reach all of your goals ( Success, Health, Relationships) etc. via the acquistion of positive habits."
5,A strong guide to business and personal self-help.,"The book walks the reader through the seven habits and provides practical concrete examples for how they can be applied in the everyday life of the reader. There were habits that I saw could be put into use immediately in my own life as well as other aspects that seemed like good ways to help think about future directions.Covey roots his philosophy of change in building habits that endure and suggests grounding those habits in sustainable personal integrity. Covey writes with confidence and uses a clear, readable style. Recommend."
5,Better than the Bible,Before I read this book I never finished anything. Now I feel like a whole new pers
1,Career orientated brainwasher - disorganised,"Read the book, but found it hard to read. Many better self help book exists, such as ""think and grow rich"", or rich dad books, or ""how to win friends and influence people""This book is soley aimed at career minded people and will not help you get rich in the long run..Hard to grasp concepts, that appear wishy washy, not thought through, poorly presented in a disorganised fashion. Feels like brainwashing...I doubt that highly effective people would read this book."
4,One very useful book,"I was inspired to read this book by a colleague of mine, and I am happy I listened to him. I can make a lot of parallels beteen what this book teaches and the content of Deepak Chopra's ""The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success"". Enjoy."
3,It is logical,"There is no mumbo jumbo here. It is logical and practical. The author clarifies to the reader how to take personal responsibility, establish a vision and then how to manage the activities that will lead to fulfillment of your vision. Once you know how to function independently, you have a foundation for interdependence."
3,Overworded,"Over-worded is a good review for this book. That is all that really needs to be said, however, I will elaborate just a bit. This book has 7 really good principles in it that should be practiced by everyone in my opinion. The problem with the book is that the Author has elaborated on them to the point of exhaustion. If this book was cut in half it would be great. As is I give it 3 stars for good principles."
4,About things we know better to do but dont do so well..a friendly reminder.,A great reminder of the little things we should know better as a grandparent or mother would say. A litlle wordy and repetitive but the underlying message is of great benefit.
4,Timeless principles,"I first read this book in 1992, and I still use what I learned from it on a daily basis. Dr. Covey explains principles of personal development and relationship building that are simply timeless."
5,Best Book for Personal Growth ever!,"I have read this book several times over my career and always find it helpful and useful. I recently bought copies for all of my employees and asked them to create personal goals based on the habits. If you read and understand the 7 habits and put them in use, you will understand yourself better, but most importantly, you will understand others better. Simply put, you must read this book to be highly effective."
5,Learn from this classic,"This classic is a byword in the area of self-improvement. If you only read one self-help book this year, make it this one.Covey writes in a style that is interesting and engaging. He speaks from personal experiences, and draws his readers into his text.For sheer practicality, do not pass up ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People."""
4,good purchase,"Its a good self-improvement book, has a philosophy and then practice. Only kink I found is some sections of the book are too verbose."
2,Not the full audio book,"I bought this thinking it was the full audio book. It is not. This is a reader's digest version of the full book. It has some good advice, but nothing new. I like the material, it is a good reminder and encourages positive change in yourself. I was most disappointed that the cd was not the full book. This is only 74 minutes."
1,"RIP OFF, RIP OFF, RIP Off","Please pay attention to the ""Minature Edition"" in the title. The ""book"" is the size and thickness of a small post it note pad. No sane person should spend $7 to get material that covers about 5 standard sized pages. This is clearly deceptive advertising. It appears that this author writes about integrity but has none of his own, as he clearly has participated in this rip off."
4,Not a quick fix book,In order for this book to change anything in your life you have to be willing to do some work. I have just finished it but I have already been able to make some positive changes in my life.This book does have buzzwords but that is because it is the book that made them popular.
3,Positive Message but....,"The book isn't bad but you can get most of what you need to be effective from the first 2 chapters. After that, it's all more of the same. Regardless, the advice is substantial, worth considering and does have value."
3,Not Bad,"Covey gives a lot of good advice in this book but He seems to take very simple principles and takes many pages to explain what could of been done in half the book. I mean I enjoyed the read but It really is a big waste of paper, short, sweet and too the point in a considerable amount of pages would of been fine. If you're looking for a great book then you will have read thisThe Fine Print of Life: How Panna Lal Found Happiness, Wisdom and Mishri Devi"
5,One of the most important books I have read in my life,"This book showed me, profoundly, what mattered in life.The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People has the ability to take you out of your own life and allow you to almost ""see yourself from the outside"" so that you can figure out what truly matters to you.As a young man, I was obsessed with ""being liked."" This book steered me away from the fools-gold of being liked for my personality and toward the reward of being respected for my (hard-won) character.""The 7 Habits"" changed my life (as did the weekend course, The Landmark Forum in an even more profound way).Recommended."
2,Boring,"Covey has some good information, but it could have been condensed into a quarter of the number of pages."
2,General new age pablum,"I'm still waiting for the sequels, second things second and third things third. I cannot believe that this book is so popular. Hitler and Stalin were also highly effective people, so beware."
1,disapointing,"Covey has done a cut and paste job of other self-help books. it is easy to write a book after having reviewed other people's books. I respect anthony robbins (after all a man who can make you walk on fire must know something) and Jim Rohn, who is a successful businesman first and an speaker second. what is coverys's claim to fame? why should we believe him? i find his language rather too fluffy and wonder if he is for real. all said and done , i did find 2 pages in the book useful, where he decribes circle of concern and circle of influence. other than that, i think covery is prejudiced, wants to impose his ideas on others and lives in some dream world of his and frankly , is a CON MAN."
1,Very Disappointed!,It was not what I wanted at all! Nor was it a good discription and when I tried to return I was unable to!
3,Good common sense,"This book offers good sound advice on the important aspects of life. It will help you achieve balance and to look at things in a different way than you are used to. However, I struggled with the concept of a personal mission statement which is a key to the whole working of the book. There is also a lack of clarity with goal-setting. The idea of 'contextual' goals are not specific enough to motivate. Worth reading but needs a bit of oomph !."
2,"Common sense that can be summarized in a few pages, not a whole book","There is no great insight from this book, but just common sense that is told with a complex language that is quite difficult to follow at times. Save yourself time and just read what the 7 habits are from one of the ""1-star"" reviewers."
2,Monument or Tool???,"I have read this book twice. I had to present material from it at two work-related seminars. It is tough to read. THE SHEER VOLUME OF USED COPIES AVAILABLE SHOULD INDICATE IT'S LACK OF ENDURING VALUE. People just are not keeping this book! The amount of effort spent in analyzing the habits and applying them is astounding. You can roll this book up and squeeze it into the ""Golden Rule"" and save yourself a lot of time and effort. The anecdotes are mildly amusing. This book is not for the person who is directly involved with the 1)customer 2) project 3)product (choose one or more)."
2,"Interesting at times, but often pompous and self-satisfied","I am not a big fan of self-help books but I can understand their appeal. Covey is very POSITIVE, his endless encouragement to go out and ""quit whining and do something about it"" can be infectious (of course this message involves plenty of diagrams and long, tedious passages). If he could keep the book pitched at this level I would be an enthusiast, unfortunately he does not...This book is interesting - partly because so many people swear by it - but I did not find it GREAT and remain slightly puzzled by all those converts."
1,THIS BOOK IS OVERRATED!!! READ THIS INSTEAD...,"I just finished reading this book, and have to say it was a serious let-down in light of the reviews. Let me save you some time and money: 1) You are responsible for your own life, so do something about it. 2) Make a plan for yourself. 3) Focus on what's important. 3)You reap what you sow--so sow well. 4)Seek mutually beneficial relationships. 5) Have empathy and be considerate to others. 6)Be cooperative. 7) Take care of yourself--mind, body, and soul. ----Ground-breaking stuff, isn't it?!?! Mr. Covey is a wealthy man for this?! Hmmmmmmm."
2,boring,"full of common sense. If you have two brain cells don't expect to discover the solution to life with this. the most striking example is a recommendation from Steve Covey exercise on daily basis, I felt I was talking to my granma. I guess I should be thankful to have a wise granma or start publishing her sayings, her and I could both become billionaire.good beach reading not more."
1,I find it sad...,"...that so many people describe this book as the best book they have ever read. Of all the great authors from Plato to Pynchon, they choose this. So much of it is tripe and ""you can do it"" psychobabble. While I will admit that it is a departure from its predecessors' message of kissing up and being likable, it is still self-evident at best and overwrought at worst. If by the time this book reaches you, you don't know how to prioritize or achieve balance, then Covey is not going to be able to help you. But at least you'll feel like you are doing something. Good for you, champ. Put those first things first."
1,Patronising drivel,"What can I say about this book that has not already been vociferouslysaid? Pure and utter drivel, insincere, self-satisfied, uselessdrivel. ( ) END"
1,"If it don't hurt, it ain't workin'","It has puzzled me for some time why people could possibly regard this book, as banal and unimaginative as it is, could achieve best-seller status. But then, I wondered the same thing about some other books - like Johnson and Blanchard's ""Who moved my cheese"" and McGraw's ""Life Strategies"".And then it clicked - some people LIKE to beat up on themselves. Somewhere along the line (from a certain kind of parent, perhaps, or a certain kind of teacher?) they learned that IIDHIAW - ""If it don't hurt, it ain't working"". Or as Jane Fonda put it: ""No pain, no gain"".And some people have captured that message and turned it into a book.Well, this is one of those IIDHIAW books. And readers who believe that pain is the only effective teacher will love every morsal of this trite nonsense.Readers who enjoy average to high self esteem, on the other hand, will most likely hate it!"
3,Same Old Self-Help Tips,At first I thought The 7 Habits was something different but the more I listened the more I realized that it was just saying the same thing as every other self-help book.
3,The Habits of Highly Effective People,Purchased the book on CD and the workbook.It is an interesting book makes you think a lot about life.More philosophical than instructional.
3,"Inspiring, But Redundant","Another interesting motivational guide to making the most of your life. This book has some great quotes and morals, but about half-way through it begins to get repetitive."
5,Focus on your circle of Influence,"My greatest take-away from this book is to keep my mind and energy focused on the things and situations I can change - It is the most rewarding way to live. Stephen Covey presents solid ideas, it is not your typical self-help book with how-tos. 7 Habits presents a concept and challenges you to own the process - to take personal responsibility for the outcome."
3,It is better to take time to read this material instead,"The author just seems to be reading the book at his pace. It is lacking artistic touch. Although he understands the material very well, he has not taken time to illustrate the material using extra examples. A role playing of several people could be more effective to make it more interesting. The material is too intense to just hear and go to the next step without thinking through. On the other hand, it works out much better just reading the book and understanding the material, making notes and see how I can relate to the material."
5,By far one of the best books,"I have read many self-help and motivational books. This was different. It goes to the heart of the matter. It makes a person examine their inner motivations. It really hits on deep issues such as character ethics, integrity, diligence, understanding, etc. I have read this book three times already in the past 10 years, and I will re-read it gain very soon. Everyone should read this book."
1,covey cd,Hardly worth ANY price. It is an approximately 60 minute introduction that I could have read in 10 minutes. Would you like to buy it back?
2,Covey book,"Pages stiff and yellowing, not noted. Item took a long time to ship - came snail mail when extra was paid for a more expedious endeavor."
1,Never Finished It,"I've tried to read this book from start-to-finish twice and couldn't get past page 100. The vocabulary is cute rather than useful or insightful. I'm glad that many have obtained value from this book, but I just see it as seminar-selling hoopla. Covey merged with FranklinQuest a short while ago and FranklinQuest's Hyrum Smith has a wonderful book ""The 10 Natural Laws of Successful Time and Life Management."" Hyrum's book gets to the point, rather than getting you hooked into a ""system""."
3,audio cd's business,"While this is good, it was so wordy with quite a bit of monotone so it was difficult to stay with the audio. I would try the abridged version next time."
4,Fitting the pieces,I've read lots of book of this type and this is one I liked better. So many books give you only some quick hints and pieces without any conection between them. This is just the book I was searching for; it helps you to fit all that different pieces that didn't seem to fit anywhere.
3,review,just an overall view of habits. not to in depth. if not familiar with material will not enlightin much.
1,"Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Miniature Edition","This book did not meet my needs. I am having to teach this book at the university level, the miniature edition was not practical. Thank you."
4,Excellent Message,"Great help to me and would be great help to anyone who reads or listens. A must for any manager. Ties in well with the Daytimer product. Only complaint is Dr. Covey's voice on the audio cassette. To me, it is very difficult to listen to."
5,impressed!,shipping was super fast ! I have it read the book I gave it to my sister and she says it's interesting. doesn't like to read so when she told me that I was impressed ..
1,dont waste your money,I received this book and it was the size of a box of matches. Nickel sized box of matches. I threw it in the trash.
4,7 Habits is worth your time,"I listened to the audiobook on my work commute. I listened to it twice in order to really own what Dr. Covey was teaching. I think it would be better to read the book, but I got a great deal out of listening to the abridged version. I especially enjoyed learning about the 4-quadrant square- it makes total sense."
5,Everyone should read this book,I don't think I read a better book than this one. Very happy I bought it and read it.
1,Mini Edition,This book is the miniture edition. Why would someone want a miniture book like this? I accidently bought this mini edition. What a joke?
3,Ok.. but I have read better.,"Perhaps this book was hyped up a little too much. I expected a little more. I read this after reading Dale Carnigy ""Win Friends and Influence People"" and Michael Garber's ""E-Myth"" both of which are amazing books that really did change my management style for the better.7 Habits was good but not enough nitty gritty. I can't explain it. If you are trying to change your management style or needs a few new ideas try reading the other ones. They have a lot more to them."
5,7 habits for highly effective people by Stephen Covey,"Needing direction? Running out of time? Realise there's more to life? If you can relate to these feeling then Stephen Covey has written the book for you. A readable and practical guide for adding focus and dimension to your life. Learn how to set goals and bring them to fruition, understand the interpersonal dynamics in relationships both personally and in the work place.Read and use this publication as a resource and reference book. Covey takes the reader through the ""7 habits"" with anecdotal examples, research and utilises others teaching such as Maslow and Victor Frankel."
5,A self-development 101 book,"Do you contrive to improve yourself? Are you fanatic about bringing in changes into your life? Have you been ambling without any goals in life? This book is a 101 for those who are interested in self-development.The author touches upon a lot of areas like beginning with the end in the mind (personal vision statement), time management, continuous learning and skill development, planning etc., It is easy to assimilate the information. This book brings in a insidious change into your life. The techniques are very practical and can be followed to improve both your personal and profession life.These 7 habits are highly contagious. Just bring in one of them into your life and you would notice that the rest will follow."
3,Read it so you'll know what everyone is talking about.,"I don't know if Covey invented the word proactive, but it and other business buzz words are explained in this book. If you are into self-help, you'll enjoy the warm manner that the book is written along with the Carnegie-like anecdotes. The book provides a system to prioritize and organize your personal and business life based on your principles. Keep the book for future reference like a text book if you are serious about applying it to your life; otherwise, get what you can out of it and share it with a fellow employee"
5,Thought-provoking and morally correct,The book changed my attitude about my work and the poor manner in which I showed love for my family and friends. It's like a new lease on life. I am now seting priorities by putting 'First Things First' and following the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.' It's a joyous tribulation to finally get things moving in some type of organizaed order. Thank you Mr. Covey for writing such great books. God Bless You.
4,Excellent,I am committed to puting into practice the seven habits. I am anticipating changes within that will bless those without.
1,Review of my product,The quality of the book is not what I expected. The pages were all pale yellow and seems like I had a bad deal for this book.
1,"Old, yellowed book sent","I didn't realize I had ordered a used book. It was a gift to a family member and I didn't open in before giving it to him. The book was 20 years old, yellowed and had markings all in it. They sent me another one after I complained. It, too, was unacceptable. I finally went to a local bookstore and purchased another one."
4,Good,Good product. I like it. Good book. Good tool. Good . Good . Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good !!
4,Excellent read,Very articulate and deliberate treatment of practical issues and circumstances in life and work that have their roots in ineffective behaviors.
4,insightfully superb,"This is one of the finest books I've ever read about personal management and development.The highlights of this book for me are the Time Matrix, which is divided into four quandrants starting on page 149; this technique can be life altering, and is simple in concept. Also, the psychological method of rephrasing the content and reflecting the feelig during dialogue, is a quantum leap in effective constructive communication, especially with teens; on page 245. And, one of the most heatwarming stories I've ever read or heard; on page 192.If you're interested in self-growth; start with this book.Joe ArrigoAuthor of, The Secret Factor for Uncommon Sales Success"
1,dissatisfied customer,"Never received the book on tape, sent questions to the seller twice. no feed back...with most items now you can at least track if they have been delivered, even without a return receipt. ALL I received after the second emial to sender was a form letter (AMAZON?) saying basically tough luck.... Not a happy buyer out $30+ bucks..."
3,Be sure about the availabilty of all pages of the book.,"if one wants to see,any page for example (149) of this book,he cant.so plz consentrate on this issue and try to provide all pages of this book.thanky.Muhammad Usman."
3,Not a good one!,I don't understand why this book is so popular. I personally didn't like the way it was written!
3,Review,"Speedy delivery. In very good condition. However didn't realise it was going to be this small. However, handy."
4,The 7 Habits Audio CD Set (unabridged),"For anyone who is into the pursuit of personal development, then this will be right up your alley. The only words of warning that come with it are ; ""do not come looking here for a quick fix or a bandaid solution"". Mr Covey speaks of concentrated effort based on important priciples which are covered in the audio and are by no means something for an overnight solution.If you have ever wanted to hear a lesson then there is gold in them there cd's"
4,Because no knowledge is bad knowledge,"I have read more than a book or two on the subject of self improvment, as it is a subject I enjoy. Sure you have heard some of the advice detailed in this book before, but could that be because most of the advice is true?No single book will give you 'the answer', but the main thing is to actually USE the advice given, get started, and keep going.This book is well worth adding to your self improvment reading collection.Andrew Radford- Author of 'The Radford Luck'The Radford Luck: Earning Power doesn't need luck, it needs..."
5,Fantastic Book,"There is a reason why this book has been so successful over the years. It is a book to help people. Everyone wants to be successful. Obviously, this book has helped many people since its been around so long and is still in print. I recommend this book.The writing in the book is easy to grasp and is written in reader-friendly language.Patrick Leonardi"
3,Interesting and Motivating,"The book makes many valid arguments, but at the same time they seem like common sense. I guess it's a good reminder. I like the book because it changed the way I view relationships and how to go about them. Definitely a good read if you are looking for a different point of way and realizations, but I think many parts of the book are boring. It's like digging through a haystack for that pin of good information."
4,Keep on Track!,"This book is a great read to keep on track and effectively work through professional and personal challenges. Brett Vanderwater, MBA, CIA, CMA, CTP"
4,Early delivery,The book was in excellent condition and even arrived before the scheduled delivery date. Thank you.
4,The Habits of Highly Effective People,This book is being used in adjunct to a class offered to a group of seniors that I belong to. The class hasn't started yet and I have just now begun reading.
5,"""Any one can change"" says Covey. I could change","I started reading this book three years ago and ever since it has been next to my bed, like a bible. I always believe that books and casettes are my best friends. That way, I read this book whenever I feel like and often. I try to discuss what I read with others as Covey says and understand better. The book changed me from an egoistic guy to a normal person after reading 'Think Win-Win'. It made me live better and focussed after reading 'Begin with the end in mind'. It made me to differentiate Important things to Urgent things after reading 'First things First'. (I bought that book too to understand the habit better)Every habit affected (and affecting me) my life and I would recommend anyone who is interested in chaging themselves to buy this book.You live only once and so live better.This book is not a just another book to give a casual read - but to study, to understand and to live better."
2,Tedious Reading,"Most of the self motivational suggestions, although accurate, have been regurgitated in every self help book over the last decade and as a result were uninspiring. It is extremely difficult to believe that I could lessen my stress by following Mr. Coveys P/PC Balance Equation and classifing my daily/weekly activities into the 4 Quadrant Time Management Matrix. Perhaps Mr. Covey has the time to list each of his key roles and create 2 weekly goals for each role and then document those goals on a weekly scheduler, but I certainly do not. In fact, I believe that the committment to adhere to such a system would result in my stressful demise. I am disheartened that I had to write such a vitriolic review of this book. After reading many rave reviews I had grandiose expectations from Mr. Covey and that has surely led me to this level of disappointment."
5,Well worth the time it takes to read.,"This book is not about an instant life transformation. It is about creating a mental perception change and the acquisition of self-purpose in life for success. This book is a little longwinded and a challenge to get through. You will need a highlighter to write notes in the margins to enable you to keep track of the valuable points and ""Habits."" I found the diagrams extremely useful; they help to clarify the valuable information contained within the book. The overall message of this Motivational self-help book is excellently delivered through the 7 habits and will help the reader become a highly effective person if they act on the advice. A classic that I thoroughly enjoyed as an author of similar genre bookTop Tips for Healthy Living: The Key to Physical, Mental and Spiritual Wellness for a Healthy Lifestyle"
3,clean your spectacles..,"As one who is making every endevour to read positve things i purchased this book. I believe the writer takes a long time to get where he is going. More than once Im saying to myself ""Get to the point!"" His information is sound but it would be helped if the book had used summaries along the way with perhaps the 'dot' points for visual clarification.My reading time is at work in lunch break as may be the case with many others or reading in short bursts fitting reading in around other things.This book doesnt lend it self to this as i have said. I envy people who have the blocks of hours to read a work because I feel this is what is needed here.A sound read not an easy one."
1,What the heck is he trying to say?,"All that Stephen says in this book can be said in 2 pages (as opposed to 360). I am apprehensive of authors who see their writing as a cathartic exercise. The book is supposed to be about effective habit. The church has nothing to do with it (unless only church going people can aim to pick up these habits). Its annoying to see Stephen mention church and god every so often. The book is a total let down as far as I am concerned.Stephen and everyone else should read ""How to get ideas"" and ""Ideaship"" by Jack Foster to understand what engaging writing is all about. I guess when authors don't have a lot to say they hide behind buzz words hoping readers won't get it. I am amazed at how people got bought in by his empty talk.Do they even understand what he is taking about?P.S - His charts and diagrams make no sense. I am an engineer and i read charts and graphs everyday."
1,It didn't help,"I was excited when this book first came out because I really needed the help. But i must admit, this book did absolutely nothing for me. My boss still walked all over me. My ex-wife still hated me. My kids still wouldn't talk to me. And the bottle still called to me. The only thing buying this book helped was Covey's bank account. If you're considering buying this book, i strongly suggest you look elsewhere, like the Catholic Church."
2,Don't waste time on the CD,"The CD was disappointing- although the book is worth the money. The CD is just 2 minute highlights about the habits, and it's not able to skip to a certain habit with your forward button...if you want to hear a habit again you have to start over from the beginning...FRUSTRATING. I wanted to have a copy to hear in the car while in traffic, in addition to the book, but I have tossed it in the trunk because it's not good.I am very unhappy that I spent almost $15 on this worthless CD."
3,Nothing Earth shattering...,"I think this is a little over-hyped. Sure the 7 habits he mentions are legitimate but nothing overly profound. It's a good little refresher I suppose. The formatting of this CD is bizarre with the little narration plus excerpts from Covey in a conference somewhere. Maybe I was turned off by the format, not to mention Covey's manner of speaking. He speaks like a counselor/academic, which is fine if that is what you want. I prefer those who speak like a normal person...Jim Collins is a good example. Just my opinion. Needless to say, i will have to DVD on Amazon anyday now to get rid of it, or donate it to the library. Not a keeper."
4,book has the right focus,"I give this book four stars because I think Covey is right that people must focus on the development of their character (as opposed to specific ""success techniques"" or ""personality strategies"") if they want to really succeed in achieving their life's purpose. I'm reminded of the story of the person who spends all this time and effort climbing to the top of a wall, but realizes to his chagrin that it's the wrong wall. Much of the wisdom in the book is common sense, but nevertheless, reading a book like this helps remind us of what's important. The author also stresses the need to prioritize daily activities and focus on what matters. This is indispenable advice that everyone should take to heart. Another excellent book in this genre isLeadership for Life - Your Guide to Becoming A Transformational Leader"
1,Avoid miniature edition,"Like another reader, I somehow buyed this edition which is microscopical in size. There are two problems:1) I guess the text is abridged because the content is not very cohesive.2) As the book is so small, it is impossible to get a sense of the structure of the content.If you had asked me right after reading the book what the 7 habits were, I wouldn't have been able to answer to you. And this hasn't changed since then. I guess I'll have to buy the unabridged standard format edition"
3,Expected,It was exactly what I thought it would be except....it was very repetitive. I understand some people need that constant reinforcement but most people don't. The major points could have been made much more concisely.
2,Meh,"I read this book when I was in my 20s and I loved it, so I figured I'd refresh and go through it again. Let's just say, it didn't hold up well for me. It felt like basic info that every human being should be somewhat equipped with anyway. I guess I was looking for something more concrete and this felt like the opposite end of the spectrum. I also wasn't interested in the religion excerpts at all. Really, it just bored the hell out of me the second time around."
1,Miniature book stinks,"Didn't realize this was a ""book"" that fits in the palm of your hand. Seriously, this book is about 2 inches high and 1 inch wide. This isn't a book, its a matchbook."
1,Only one question.....,Only one question: How did this senseless drivel become a bestseller? These platitudes could have been told in ten basic sentences.
3,7 Habits for Corporate Success,"The 7 habits are basically common sense ideas, although that can be useful in the ""can't see the forest through the trees"" sort of way. I found his stories to be more insightful than his actual program, but the program can certainly help one refocus and reorganize one's life. If your main goal in life is to climb the corporate ladder, than you will probably find this book to be helpful. There are also some useful tidbits on leading a healthier life.I suppose I would have given the book 4 stars, if I hadn't already read the classic ""How to Win Friends & Influence People"". I would suggest reading that plus ""Zen & the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"" and a biography of a person you admire instead. I think that would give you a better perspective on leading a challenging and successful life."
5,I want to read it over and over again.,"It's such a refreshing approach to the problems with our society today.We are so quick to blame our 'environment' and others for our problems.This book is a no-nonsense approach to: ""Yeah, maybe your environment was crappy and maybe the people you were surrounded by attempted to hinder your growth, but you are an adult now and only YOU can make the changes necessary to enrich your life!""Stop blaming everyone else and take the utlimate challenge: 'Resposibility to yourself'!I LOVE this book.It challenges you to not just 'read as information' but to ""DO IT""!"
1,Useless miniature version!,Didn't expect to receive a miniature version. Very disaponited that it was not clearly stated when purchased. The standard version would have been better.
3,Not for me,"My husband bought this book and (to my knowledge) has never read it. It does not interest me at all, so I have no plans of ready it."
1,Completely outdated,"The Kindle edition claims to be updated on 2002, while it still has references to Soviet Union and USA as the only country where telecom companies are privately owned. This book was probably great around 1989 when it was published, but now it's useful only if you have completely no idea of effectiveness."
5,A nice written and practical book,"This book is worthy of reading lifelong, whether you are happy or unhappy about yourself and your surroundings.To use these skills in the books is easy, but to keep these skills as habits is difficult."
3,This was an ok purchase,"This was my first purchase of a ""self help"" if you wish to call it.. Basically it helps / guides your train of thought so you as an individual become more focused at the task at hand. More like prioritize what is important and how to achieve it through success. For example, step 1 ""Knowing / identifying the problem""..if you cant figure out the problem, then you can never solve, find a solution etc..To me allot of this is common knowledge, but to those who have a hard time identifying such this is a great audio..."
3,Great oncepts buried in personal experiences.,"This very popular book provides a wealth of information, unfortunately poorly written and poorly edited. The great concepts are lost with the author boring his readers with his long winded personal examples of his experiences with his wife and son. It becomes obvious that the author does not or cannot follow his own process, or is so emotionally attached to his personal life experiences that he believes he must blather on and on about his life. So the reader yoyo's up and down with interesting thought provoking ideas following by innane personal experiences of the author."
5,Stephen - where is the workbook to the 7 Habits?,"I could not add another single line of praise than all the wonderful things that have already been written about Covey and the ideas and principles contained in his books. I value the The 7 Habits and it has made incredible contributions to my life. However, I would LOVE to see a companion workbook to the 7 Habits so that I could apply the teaching more easily and track my progress."
2,Not a real book,"Somewhere I missed the fact tat this is not a full size book, but a mini book. Waste of money!"
3,How the 7 Habits helped me in my life,I always go back to Covey when I am starting to have self doubt about myself in my decisions to stay motivated and on track. Why is it that in life we know the basics to succeed but it is not always easy to stay on track. He sets 7 basic habits that are so easy to follow. The book is powerful and very inspirational. Even after to have read the book you might always go back and read over the 7 steps just to give yourself a little push in your step for the day!
2,The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,It took FOREVER to get this book and I was about half-way through my class by the time I got it.
2,Right out of Church,"I am glad that someone put religion and business together. I am glad that all the religions in the world agree. Lets get real people. Business is business. You want sentiment, business and realism read Secret Formulas of the Wizard of Ads by Roy H. Williams. New Age is out reality is in."
1,Hogwash!,Children do not naturally share anything. They have to be taught. Covey needs to read the Bible if he wants to know the truth. I'm required to read his book for a college course. Its a total waste of time and money.
1,the 7 habits of highly effective people,This book has got to be the worst book ive ever attempted to read/listen to. Far to wordy and of no practical value the way its composed. I do not recommend this book to anyone.
3,Audio Book,"Having read the book, I was left with a sense that the abridged audio book lacked more detail. However, the concepts are still magnificent."
4,Surprise,"I don't know how but I missed the information that this book was a miniature, so it was a funny surprise when I received the pack. But after I read it I knew it was worthy to keep it anyway! Really good and compact insights and informations... It really helped me to have a better view of life and managing it! It is a really good small book!"
4,This is pretty good but not really life changing.. for me.,"I use audio books when I don't know if I'll want to spend the time reading the book. If I like the audio I buy the print. If not... then nothing. I won't buy the print, but I can't say I didn't like it either.Stephen Covey is good in that I think he hits the core of how to change your life. However I feel that those who have the discipline to go through with what's necessary probably don't need the book.Ha ha. But there IS a lot that IS memorable that I do take with me on a regular basis. Maybe I should listen repeatedly...The book is concept based and has little hype (not motivational which I think is good).Overall worth the while since it's audio and therefore won't eat a lot of time. Who knows, may work well for you."
5,A DEFINITE MUST-READ !!,"I read this book years ago, when a friend recommended it to me. I thought to myself, ""Oh no, this is going to be one of those books with a great message, but in terms that are so slow and boring, I'll never make it through!"". I was only half right - it has a great message. But, the rest of my impression was so far off! This book is interesting, enlightening, and well written. It talks about values and ideas that we all need and want in our lives, and how to obtain them. I have recommended this book to other friends, and still hold my own copy today."
4,"Great, but could have been less pages","Yes it is a great book, however at some point I got the feeling that Stephen Covey kept repeating himself and his (powerful!) message and I thought: ""OK, I get it, let's move on"". But perhaps I was missing the ""power of repetition"". Anyway, I can't imagine that someone will be disappointed with this book, as it is one of the better books out there for self development."
5,"Great Book On Self-Improvement, But ....","This is one of the best books ever written on this subject. I suggest that this is the one to use. But in order to successfully implement ""THE 7 HABITS .."", you should make sure you have all your own blocks in line. Make sure you have a handle on your own values. You should be asking questions like ""WHY is this or that right or wrong, good or evil, moral or immoral?"". For that part of it, I'll give you a heads up that will save you a ton of other reading --- and money. Get hold of what's becoming the ""companion book"" of all the how-to books on self-help, leadership, and character, a book for boneing up on character, morals, and ethics titled ""WEST POINT"", by Norman Thomas Remick. Then implement the suggestions in Mr. Covey's excellent book, ""THE 7 HABITS ...""."
5,Required reading for everyone,"I've had this book on my buy list forever, it seems, because it is on the recommended reading lists of so many ""influential people"" whose philosophies I have embraced in many years of running a business. I wish I had read it as a teenager. I can only say that reading this book will make you a better person in dealing with the many different personalities you encounter in the course of life if you adhere to only some of the ""seven habits""."
5,i like this book,"if you're bored with life or if you love life, it's for anyone. this book will help us realize why we want what we want, and what we should and shouldn't change based on desired results, and where we will end up."
2,Not very good,I had high hopes for this book but the beginning was boring and very repetitive. As much as I tried I could not finish this book.
4,The Best of Personal Growth and Development,"I have read and studied approaches to personal growth over the years. In recent years due to health challenges that pursuit has taken on more spiritual pursuits. I have read and listened to Stephen Covey for almost 20 years. I had the great pleasure of hearing Stephen Covey in person. I happened to bump into Mr. Covey during a break in the day's activities. He was walking with several people and I apologized for interrupting that I might have a brief word with him. He was patient and totally attentive to what I had to say. I felt as though we were long time friends and that he was genuinely interested in me. Stephen Covey is the real deal. His teachings are not about techniques and personality. They are about principles and character. Take the time to do the exercises. They will benefit your mind, your body, your soul, and those around you."
4,very good read,"The book is well written and easy to follow, I have used some of the principals already and seeing results,it may not happen over night but if you stick with the principals it will happen,I sometimes feel my self slipping back in to old habits but the mission statement that I wrote out with the help of the book is a good way to bring me back on track,it is not easy changing habits of a life time but very much worthwhile.would recommend this book."
4,A solid model,"If you haven't read this book, you should. It has some good ideas and presents a solid model. My only concern is the focus on time management and the personal planner. If we are to become a society entirely obsessed with time management and personal effectiveness, perhaps we are missing the joy of rambling without purpose. But, if you need greater time management and effectiveness, there are some excellent and helpful concepts in this book. I have found the circle of concern/influence to be a timeless lesson."
3,OK - but obvious,"If you read all the other ""self-improvement"", ""Rah-Rah"" ""personal time management"" and ""lets get our lives together"" type books, you know where he gets his material from. Its just homogenized and sanitized. Plagerism? Not exactly. It's hard to put your finger on it. Don't get me wrong - it is a fairly good book and a worthwhile read. However we've all heard this before. Use what you can with a grain of reality salt.One guy in our office was so taken with it that he drove everyone around him crazy with the delegation and time management aspects that his supervisor finally told him to knock it off. Seems he was delegating too much.Also, where does this guy get the idea that we can all afford to just take a year off and call it a sabattical? Must be nice. Think I'll write a book and take a year off!"
4,Universal Truth,"Covey's Seven Habits, at times, warmed me from the inside out as if it were teaching universal truths. Although at times I felt like I was back inPsych 101 it maintained a warm feel to it's principles. Iwould encourage anyone to read it but do not expect to readit quickly. It is much more enjoyable and beneficial tobite and chew a little each day."
3,A Bit of a Letdown,"This business classic by Stephen Covey left me disappointed overall. I did extract some significant thoughts that can be used as quotes and food for thought:1. To learn and not do is really not to learn; to know and not do is really not to know.2. As you care less about what others think of you, you will care more about what others think of themselves and their worlds, including their relationship with you.3. The language of reactive people absolves them of responsibility, becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.4. You can't talk your way out of problems you behave yourself into.5. Air doesn't motivate you when you have it--only when it is sucked out of the room. Unsatisfied needs motivate.For all of the content (350+ pages) there is an awful lot of theory and precious little practicality. Had the above points been included in a work about 1/3 the length, coupled with some good illustrations and a few practical exercises, this would have proven to be a better use of my time."
5,An excellent test,"This is the first day of the semester and the first class of the day. You enter to the classroom and the teacher passes a test. You think, oh maybe it's just a test asking for personal information. Then, you realize that it is a diagnostic test. You'll think, ok, I know the answers because last semester we learned this. The test is divided in seven sections and you discover that some of them you don't even remember. By the time you are answering the questions you'll find topics that you know you have already learned last semester but you thought that it was easy to remember or not very important so you didn't pay enough attention and now you want to know the answers. Seven Habits is like taking a diagnostic test like this.If you read it, you'll figure out what in life you don't have to take easy or unimportant and how to let it be a habit."
2,What a load of rubbish,I was doing pretty well with this book until I came to the part where he was demonstrating effective listening skills with a conversation he supposedly had with his son about staying in school. The conversation was ridiculous to anyone who has teenage children. With just a few choice sentences he convinced his son that staying in school is the right and proper thing to do and the beauty part was the kid thinks he convinced himself! Rubbish! This was a dialogue made up by the author to make a point although he says it really happened. If it did then I'm Santa Claus. I stopped reading at that point.
2,Highly Effectice People,"I feel a lot of what's written here is a rip off of author L. Ron Hubbard's materials from the 50s through the 70s, yet with no acknowledgement of the source of the info."
1,Repetitive Self-Help Fluff,"This is the most overly-used and overly repetitive books I have yet to come across. I got nothing from it other than a picture of the authors narcissism. If you get something from it, great, but any critical reader wont be so tricked into thinking they have become enlightened."
2,The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,"I was 13 when my mother gave me a copy of the teens version and it has changed my life and allowed me to go through a fairly proactive teenage life. I bought a copy of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People at the age of 18. I didn't prefer it, I thought I'd give myself two more years to grow out of the teens book. At 20, I still could not relate to the book, however I did continue reading. At my current age of 22, I can barely believe how boring it is at times. I am training to be the future C.E.O. of our family business and I think that this may be for adults, but it seems like you have to be at the age of 40 to appreciate it.Maybe Covey should come up with a yuppie version of the book, or something for college students."
1,8th Habit: Don't buy worthless generic books,"The reason why astrologers seem dead on is because they are so generic they would seem to fit anyone's situation. The same goes for this book. This books habits are so generic and so vague that they are practically useless. For instance, ""sharpen the saw"" is so vague and common sense that it is useless. You can sharpen your saw much better by buying a different book."
1,Ethics Might Count,"Covey has 9 children and 49 grandchildren, and a personal empire.Is this a habit we should all emulate to make the world a better place? Or is it the ultimate statement of the self-seeking greed that has created the world of suffering we live in now?For some books, the author's personal life or lifestyle are irrelevant. But when someone is pushing their concept of Christian ethics on others, they had better look in their own hypocritical closet first. Or maybe Brittney Spears should write a book entitled ""A Life in Service of Others: using fame and wealth that you didnt earn to benefit the less fortunate."""
2,Overrated Common Sense,"This book is overrated. If you have common sense and a good set of values and can think for yourself, you don't need this book. On the other hand, if you are a follower who needs a role model to spoon feed you, this book is as good as any other self help book."
4,No Tracks!,"The content of this CD is great of course, but it is one long track! If you decide to listen to half then go back, forget it, you need to start over then ""fast"" forward to where you left off, if you know or can remember. It would have been so nice for the producers to put down 7 or 10 tracks so that you could pick and choose what you want to listen to, unless they expect you to listen to this only once."
4,The Book Bash Reviews,"A very insightful read if you can get passed all the technical jargon that makes us common folks brains stutter, LOL. But, seriously, I was actually able to incorporate some of his techniques into the way I discipline my children and so far it's worked out great. I definitely recommend this book."
2,Not worth it...,"The book is not at all what I expected. Which a lot is my fault maybe for not reading enough into the details of the description. But, the book is so small and doesn't have the content that the full edition would. My suggestion is to buy the original, not the miniature edition."
1,"Should have been called: ""Personal Development For Dummies""!","How anyone could benefit from this book is beyond me!Covey misunderstands key concepts of the psychological theories that he uses, and the ""preachings"" of integrity and personal values should bring nothing new to a fairly normal person.""Don't lie, or people will eventually lose trust in you"" is as groundbreaking and informative as writing ""Don't bang your head repeatedly against the wall, or you will end up with a headache""!! This mix of Kant'ian and judeo-christian philosophy with popular psychology and painfully obvious common sense just doesn't cut it! Poor job, Stephen!!!"
1,Not very interesting to me.,"I have been told countless times that I have to read this book, and that it is quite fantastic. Unfortunately I found it quite dull to read. I used to have a paper copy of the teen version(Seven Habits of Highly Effective Teens) of this book, but gave it away due to lack of interest. I was finally coerced into buying this digital copy by my boss who thought that all of his interns should read it. I was informed that it was much better than the teen version. Boo.I really don't get what all the hype is about... What a waste of $7."
3,Difficult to read; needs an editor to make it more concise,The title to the book really drew me in; I figured this book would be concise and to the point with its 7 habits. I got about 25% through the book and I think I was still on habit one. I am not even really sure which habit I was on at that point. The book needs to be re-edited. Each topic drags on unnecessarily and I kept losing interest. I just kept thinking--when is he going to get to the point here. Some of the reading is very difficult and unnecessarily complicated. I finally gave up after getting about a quarter of the way through. I got more out of reading the most helpful review on Amazon--it listed the 7 habits and explained them very quickly and concisely.
1,"7 Habits, Zero Insights",Most overrated book of the decade. Surely it is merely the cool title that inspires people to buy this collection of obvious observations and feel-good self-improvement theoretical jargon. Anybody that actually finds the ideas in this book to be original is probably too dense to ever be an 'effective' person themselves.
1,What happened to the book I ordered?,"Couldn't believe it when I received a tiny little ""mini-book"" which I rate ""0"", when I had read an interesting excerpt on this book, ordered that book, and the book I received did not even include the ""excerpt"", much less anything else I expected to receive. Guess I'll have to take my loss, but I will not be so trusting anymore. I think I deserve some sort of credit for getting such a disappointing book, not as advertised."
5,A classic life enhancer,"Covey's book is a classic that I frequently pull off my shelf to review. This CD set is a convenient way to review the timeless principles Covey teaches and to trigger thoughts about new applications in my own life while I'm on the road.I'm a big supporter of listening to self development and training material while you drive/ride. Currently in my car's CD player: Dave Lakhani's ""Making Marketing Work"" (a guide for successful sales/marketing in today's world), Kevin Hogan's ""Time for Love, Time for Money"" (rock solid set on time, energy and financial creation) . . . and High School Musical 2 soundtrack (for my girls, not me - really!).Your life will be richer - way beyond finances - for reading Covey's book and frequently reinforcing with this set of CDs. Even if you have not read the book and don't intend to, you will still benefit from these CDs.Mollie MartiAuthor, Selling: Powerful New Strategies for Sales Success"
3,Every home and workplace should have one (or more),"One of the greatest contributions to the field of human potential - a best seller for all the right reasons. The basic ideas are essential for anyone wishing to truly make a difference and achieve. A mindset/worldview that is relevant for everyone and practical/accessible tools.The book is not an easy read and the CDs might be an easier way to access the profound wisdom that Stephen has put together.Beware, there is no 8th Habit (despite the book of the same name) - there is nothing new in that book. First Things First and Principle-Centred Leadership are worth reading but this is, without doubt, the seminal work."
5,Necessary Reading [for some],"All the preaching and 'self help-isms' aside... if you read this book and come away from it not having identified at least one major area of you life that could be improved, with the confidence that you do in fact have the power to improve it, you're probably perfect.OR - You probably don't have the capability to examine yourself, and improve yourself based upon you self-examination. If you fit THIS picture.. don't buy the book. You won't like it."
2,Either you got it or you don't!,"This book is filled with some useful knowledge. However, many of the issues brought up are things that usually people are born with and they can't be learned. Successful people were observed to find these characteristics, and they didn't read this book. I am very doubtful that many people will read this book and walk away a much grander person. One will probably find one or two things to work on, but the book is too wordy and long to be worth most people's time."
2,Doesn't Earn the Hype,"Covey has some good principles, but those that make the most sense are really stating the obvious. The most impressive strategic business revelation I came away with is respect for Covey's PR machine. Maybe I was expecting more after all the hype."
2,Don't believe the hype!!!,"A boring book. If I would have known that he had an MBA from Harvard I would have reconsidered buying this book. I could have written this book in 20 pages, not to mention in a more entertaining fashion!!!Do not buy this book. I would recommend a book written by Rick Pitino or another coach/successful athlete."
4,nice ideas for people learning about self help,This is a good read for people who have to work with others. This book helps a person relate to people in authority and inspire to bring out the good in others too. I would recommend this to people who delegate work to others.
5,Totally inspiring,"I am so thankful to the person who gave me this book to read. I have undergone many paradigm shifts and I'm only up to habit number three! Some of the book has been affirming of what I am currently doing, some of the book has challenged long-held beliefs and goals. All I can say is THANK YOU."
3,supposed to be a good book.,"Kind of slow getting started, I hope it gets better as it goes on. Just can't get into at this point."
3,Difficult to read,"I found it to be dry, and difficult to stay interested. I believe the information to be accurate, however not written in a way to keep my interest."
5,Great Book,This book is great...if you actually follow the guidelines you will have a great/productive life. The reading is easy...the doing is the challenge.
4,An outstanding movie!,"This movie is great! I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone. It features outstanding acting, excellent cinematography, and incredible musical scores! My favorite part in the whole movie is the song that introduces the main character ""Cornbread."" I hope that you enjoy this movie as much as I have and do. In fact this movie has inspired a small Cornbread groupie movement amongst the counselors and lifeguards at a certain up-scale mountain resort. If it has the power to do that, think what it could do for you. Like the song says.... ""It's Cornbread!"" So just buy it."
2,"Worked perfect at first, then I get every error msg it has.","I got this from Best Buy a couple of months ago, installed it, and burned cds with perfect speed and perfect quality. All was fine through the first 30 or so cds, but after that I started getting weird error messages in Nero (the one I always used with it). So, I contacted Nero tech support and asked them what the problem could be, took a week and a half to get a response, and finally they ask me if my system meets all the requirements. Here's the kicker: I gave them the system requirements for the CD Burner, my system specs, and how I had the burner set up. So after that I contacted I/O magic's tech support, and I still haven't gotten a response after a week. So this thing is coming out of my computer and going back to the store. If you're thinking of buying this, I recommend making paper airplanes with your money instead. They're alot cheaper than the cds I had to buy, only for them to be turned into coasters."
1,Twaddle,"This books is mostly twaddle. Sitwell indulges her over-active ego in something that certainly is not an autobiography. These are a series of essays on various topics, mostly very boring. She has one chapter that is a rant about modern vulgarity. Among other things, she thinks pajama parties are vulgar. The chapter is unintentionally rather funny though one does not want to read it in detail. There are a few good British insults here such as the host who tells his guest--""You must visit me again when you have less time."" Now that you have read this, you don't need to buy the book."
5,Rare insight,"This book opens up the entire scope of British druidry - if you know how to read it. Imagine that you have been given the opportunity to read the diary of Taliesin (Welsh bard about the time of King Arthur). Imagine that instead of just the stories of Taliesin that you also had access to Taliesin's thoughts while he was writing them. Now transpose that image to a diminutive 21st century woman and you'll know how to read this book, for like Taliesen, Emma weaves her visions of an Otherworld with a life of service in this world - faith and works combined. And, she does so with a radical honesty and a mytho-poetic style worthy of any long lost bard. Don't miss this opportunity."
2,Not sure,The first month I got these they worked great but this second month they don't seem to be doing anything at all. Will not be purchasing these again.
5,Wish I could give it more stars...,"I'd never read anything by Dixie Cash before but I'll certainly order her first book now. I loved this book. It was funny and the characters were so endearing. For just a little while the reader is allowed to enter a world different from our own and it was such a pleasure. I've recommended this to friends and have had a couple call and thank me already. Keep up the good works Ms. Cash. Anything that makes me laugh, with everything that's going on around us, deserves 5 stars and more."
1,Too Crass for Me,I am saddened by how far popular culture has sunk in recent years. I disliked the crassness of this book. It was trashy and it disappointed me.
3,Its cute enough,"Its cute enough but its nothing to get too excited about. Dixie Cash is the writing team of Jeffery McClanahan and Pamela Cumbie, sisters from West Texas. And while this book offers up some good humor, it doesn't really feel well put together and the characters so stereotypical they're almost boring for all their humor. If you really want to read it, I suggest borrowing it from a friend or the library, don't spend money on it."
3,Pretty Good,"The best thing about this book is its wonderful title (which I couldn't resist). Having lived in Texas for several decades, I found that the description a small Texas town rings true.However, there simply wasn't as much substance to this book as there should have been. The book reads as an outline that needs to be fleshed out with a lot more depth and detail. The bones for an entertaining read are there, but everything happens way too fast and without enough foundation. When you get to the villain of the piece, you're likely to say, ""Who?""All in all, not a bad effort, but next time, add about 100 more pages and some believable character development, because it generally takes more than a couple of weeks and lots of trial and error for someone to turn her life around."
3,For Newbies,"Great book for newbies to the world of running a classroom for kids with Autism. If you've worked with kids with Autism for a while, this book does not inform you of anything you don't already know. If I'd organized myself and put my mind to it, I could have written this book myself."
1,Slaughter of the Innocents,"I received Slaughter of the Innocents and when it arrived, it was completely broken. I cannot view this VHS tape because it is broken and I need a new Slaughter of the Innocents VHS tape. How can I send this one back and receive a new one? Thank you..SincerelyDiana LaCroixldiana9@cox.net"
4,Really Cool Movie,"I haven't seen this movie in a while, in most part, because I couldn't find it. Anyway, I saw it a long time ago and it was so cool. I was around 13, and an avid horror movie watcher. I was never nervous to watch any type of horror around my parents, until this movie. This movie is pretty gory and very entertaining. It is very nerve racking and pretty suspenseful."
2,From the inside out,"Huh. This was certainly an interesting movie, although not the best of the psychological-thriller drama. I actually played a minute role (Kristi Collins) and remember the whole production and premis as very scary, but also very sophisticated. Twelve or so years later, I find this movie a bit disjointed. Still, it is well worth the buck fifty to check it out from a small town video store and watch. That is, if one is not looking for something too intellectually taxing."
5,awesome,This movie is one of the best ever. I watched it one night and I have never been able to forget it.now I'm ordering it on Amazon to keep it in my Library....Watch it and ENJOY
4,The good benifets,This toy was worth buying! It seems fun to me since I play with legos. I`ve been waiting for a toy like this! If I were you I would buy it
4,My [...] loves it.,My son loves Star Wars and Lego so these sets are perfect for him. The design is great and the sets help him to learn how to foolow directions. He's been building on his own for over a year now and loves to take apart and rebuild any Lego set on a rainy day. He used to get frustrated that they sets fell apart but has learned to handle them so that they are generally pretty sturdy.
1,Bait and Switch!,WARNING!!!!! Not Set #10227! This is a bait and switch attempt to get you to order this Lego set #6208. Notice that the part number is mysteriously missing from the title description and nowhere to be found in the listing. They are pricing the cheap set at $194 in a blatant attempt to trick people into thinking they are saving a few dollars off the more expensive set which is sold in stores now at $199. BEWARE!!!
5,"Absorb this film about crime, betrayal, loss, guilt, redemption","This story is so much about the setting, in the Ozark Mountains, where growing pot is one of the few ways to make enough money to keep your land, where men drink and drive as long as they avoid the downtown area, where rednecks clear out the fish fry for a fight in the parking lot, and where a bluegrass jamboree is a way to while away a humid evening. The scenery is beautiful, but everyone's isolation is tragic. The bar fight is one of the best scenes, with no professional moves, just a heck of a lot of slapping, kicking, and stumbling. There is nothing suave about the bar fight. The realism was beautiful, especially as Thornton's character let his arch enemy get a riled up while Thornton himself remained steady.The movie starts out slow, but the action in the middle is powerful, and the ending is a sucker punch to the gut. The characters are vivid and true. This is a haunting tale about loss, guilt, and redemption."
2,blah..but worth a go,"This movie isn't all that great...but not bad, either. Sort of blah. It has all of the makings of a sincerely good film, but falls flat somewhere along the line. Billy Bob Thornton's acting isn't quite up to the usual standards, and the woman playing Chrystal does an excellent job - however, I believe more scenes from the past would have aided in this film's overall success. The scenery is beautiful, I believe it was filmed in Eureka Springs, Arkansas so that's very close to my own heart. In my opinion it was worth watching for the scenery alone."
3,Take SDH out of the title.,"With the current explosion of SDH networking across the globe, a reader would expect a little more substance on SDH in a book that claims to also cover SDH. While the book does highlight SDH in a few chapters, it lacks greatly and cross-references much information on SDH to SONET. While SONET and SDH are similar, they are not the same and the book can confuse readers wanting to learn about SDH by referencing SONET rates in an SDH chapter. I wish some of these authors would get off the SDH bandwagon and stop trying to write something in an area that appears to be outside their expertise. This book is a book about SONET and ATM. For any reader wishing to learn more on SDH, this book is NOT the book to read. The only thing I found useful in this book was the figures available on the CD inside the cover. What I do with the book now is let it collect dust on my bookshelf."
5,the only book that doesn't assume a baseline knowledge...,"Coming to the telecommunications industry from a totally different area - I didn't know where to begin, the learning curve was steep and there isn't a lot of learning material on SDH in North America. I loved this book. There's a bunch of online tutorials if you look to the industry leader websites, but it's all assumming a core level of knowledge. I found I was wasting too much time just trying to figure out the smallest details.Kartalopoulos - has taught the subject at many seminars and knew which areas gave people the most difficulty. It's obvious that he took this input to heart when clarifying issues that many others don't think to spend time on - and the way he does it is great."
3,Ample illustration / Inordinary approach,"The book is thin ( less than 300 pages ). However, it covers 2 topics: SONET and ATM. It goes in a slightly abnormal way to arrange the content: Many detail facts, less explaination. For example, it provides a huge amount of figures in comparison with other books. There are some sentances describing the coverage of SONET on OSI-RM to be from layer 1 to layer 7, but no further discussion to tell us why? It does give us a crue to refer to the GR documents of Bellcore, but this apears to be another difficault problem. It's also a pity of lacking completeness. For example, TMN is not mentioned here; while in other books TMN occupies a certain space for its expectation to operate SONET management. All the cases above apple to the 2nd half of this book, ATM.Overall, the book still worths a glance. The value of this book lies on the depth of each topic discussed. Along with marvelous figures, this is fairly a good source for reference."
3,Science fun in the bathroom for the preschool/primary crowd,"Simple science experiments all done in the bathroom - always fun - with easy to find and use materials. What works: the set-up - each experiment is based on a question (why do boats float?, how does the toilet flush?, why do I turn red in the tub?), clearly written directions, colorful illustrations, simple explanations of what should happen and why, and safety tips. What doesn't work: stupid jokes and naming the animal characters after famous scientists. Quiz, glossary, and index included along with a short quiz and an explanation on how to use the book."
5,Great product,I purchased this to do several panel door fronts for several built in cabinet. These worked like a dream. I highly recommend.
4,"Good plot, a very cute movie.","I just recently saw this movie after last seeing it about 9 years ago.This was one of my favorite movies when I was that age, and seeing it again brings back good memories of my childhood. The plot is unusually creative for a children's movie. The humor is very cute as well. I would recommend this movie to cartoon fans of all ages. =o)"
5,Rainbow Brite=My hero!,"This movie is a one-of-a-kind treasure for kids and adults. It's one of the most creative animated movies that I've ever seen. The story's great, the characters are awesome, and the music's superb! Rainbow Brite is yet another treasure from the 80's!"
3,FALSE ADVERTISING,"i loved this movie as a child, but ever since i ordered it in decemeber, i am still waiting for and keep approving delays in my order - almost 8 months later. i'm getting pretty upset with amazon for advertising something on their website, that they cannot provide. don't bother ordering this dvd from amazon unless you like approving delays on your order.****UPDATE****i finally ordered one off ebay, and it arrived four days later. thanks ebay!"
5,Unique!,This movie is incredible.I've loved it forever.I will always treasure it.Its great.It has inspired me.
4,Rainbows!,I practically died after watching this! I can't believe I got another chance to watch this cartoon! I hope there are more Rainbow Brite DVDs to follow.
3,You have no idea how heart-wrenching this is to admit it...,"When I was little I used to love Rainbow Brite, so naturally, when I saw that this movie was on Pay Per View, I was all excited and ordered it- and it [was bad]. While I loved the memories, I just couldn't imagine how I loved this movie so much. Of course, Rainbow Brite wasn't made for adults, it was made for children. So, buy this for the kids, it's a cute movie. But I, as an adult, almost wish I hadn't watched it so I wouldn't destroy my wonderful memories. Things just look different from a 4 year old's perspective as compared to a 20 somethings! But hey, if you're a die-hard Rainbow Brite fan, go for it- who am I to persuade you not to??? lol"
4,My hero is still Rainbow Brite,I loved the dvd all though I still have the tape from when I was a kid and there's some scenes missing from the dvd. Which kinda blows but whatever it was worth it to me
5,"Twink, the star sprinkles...","I LOVE this movie! This was without a doubt one of the best children's movies of the 80's, along with the Chipmunk Adventure, and The My Little Pony Movie. My question is, when are they going to release the TV episodes on DVD??"
3,See a Shiny Star...,"When I was a child, I loved Rainbow Brite. A couple of years ago I got the opportunity to watch this movie again. It really doesn't stand the test of time for adults. My main problem with this movie is that the evil doer is this bratty teenager character who is being persuaded by this guy to do a lot of the evil stuff she is doing. This gender dynamic really bothered me. Usually when I watch movie/read books from my childhood, I try to keep an open mind, but a lot of the stuff in this movie just didn't seem cool to me.If you loved Rainbow Brite as a kid, definitely check this movie out. Relieve a bit of your childhood. If you are thinking of introducing Rainbow Brite to your kids, watch the movie first. The movie definitely isn't horrible, but I have definitely seen kid movies that had a better script and less gender stuff going on."
3,Rainbow Brite,"Cute old cartoon. Graphics not updated, remember it's from a long time ago. My children enjoyed it, but it's never their first choice to watch (only have watched a few times)."
4,Rainbow Brite - Invasion of Rainbow Land Review,"This movie is great for little girls about the age of 6. I babysit for one and she loved this movie. I think the idea of a rainbow heroine lights up their eyes. This movie is a good one to purchase for your daughter so don't hesitate to order it. The plotline is heartwarming and the ending is, as always in a kid movie, a good one. As the little gorl I babysit said, ""Am I ever going to see one of rainbow brite's rainbows?"" I said,"" I hope so"" Now your child can see the rainbows, too."
2,Not as good as I remember,"You can definitely tell times have changed by watching older shows such as this. The colors aren't as vibrant as I remembered. I let my 3 and 4 year old nieces watch this and it didn't hold there attention very long. It does make you realize the educational strides we have made over the past few decades, though. This movie showed when good vs. bad; good wins...much like all cartoons of that time. Now adays cartoons are teaching our children the alphabet, numbers, sharing, caring, and even different languages! I say stick with today's programs!"
4,"A LITTLE ""THIN-SKINNED"" FOR OUTDOOR USE","GOOD CABLE FOR INDOOR OR CONDUIT INSTALL. OUTER INSULATION IS TOO THIN FOR OUTDOOR USE. ALSO USE CARE WHEN SPLITTING THE RG-59 AND POWER WIRES, THE INSULATION CAN TEAR OUT LEAVING THE INDIVIDUAL POWER WIRES SHOWING (STILL INDIVIDUALLY INSULATED BUT UNSIGHTLY) OVERALL GOOD STUFF FOR THE PRICE. I'M ON MY SECOND ROLL."
4,Leaves,Love the book. The only thing I was concerned about was that some of the sites in describing the used books said they didn't have the CD anymore so I ordered a new book but there was no CD when it came. So I need to take the time to find out why some of the books included CDs.
4,Really Good Set,"I ahve dug Glenn Campbell's Music since I was a Child.He covered a Cool Range of Music from Country to Pop&Balanced it out really well.""Rhinestone Cowboy""""Southern Nights"",""Galveston"" are my main cuts here.I enjoy His Vocals&the Musical Stylings here."
3,Great songs. Not the best quality sound,"If you like Glen Campbell, you will know most of these songs. They are all great. However, the quality of the sound of the CD leaves much to be desired. It does not do justice to Campbell's music either. I'd look for re-mastered versions of these songs if you want to hear Campbell at his best."
5,All the Best of Glen Campbell,"It was difficult to wait for this to arrive, as I have always enjoyed Glen Campbell!When I received the product, I found it to be just as stated when I was ordering it.I now have it on my computer and mp3 player, so whether home or on the go Glen is always with me."
1,Poor Sound Quality,"I was anxious to get this album so asa to have most of Glen's music on one cd.Plus the fact that it is supposed to be remastered really hooked me. What a disappointment! The sound is terrible! How can it be worse than his GH CD from 1987.I bought Wichita Lineman Remastered from the same label ""Capitol"" and it sounded great. One reviewer called it thin and tinny but I would add and even worse is muffled. What a blunder. I'm out 20 bucks."
4,I waited 30 years for this!,"I am 53 and have waited a long time for a good comprehensive collection of Glen Campbell. The music is timeless. I work in an office with young people (23-31 yrs). We take turns playing CD's. All of them said what a great CD this is and they request it regularly. It is one of my favorites. The music is first rate. The recording quality is mediocre; which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. Nevertheless, the music sounds as good or better than when it was recorded 30 years ago."
4,"Good series, ok show","The entire Bibleman series is great. This one could use a little work. It's not as 'high tech' as some of the newer ones like Conquering the Wrath of Rage. I highly recommend that one. Still, this one is one of the better Bibleman movies I've seen, because even though it's not as 'high tech', it's got alot of action and the morale is great. I recommend it to anybody."
5,Heart Warming Memories,"This is a wonderful story the was quite enjoyable to read. Mr. Smith paints a vivid picture of the life he experienced growing up in a small town during the 30's and 40's. His words take you on many adventures he witnessed as a young man, and you find yourself wondering what will happen next.Very impressive for his first book, keep 'em comin! You know your reading a great book when you find it hard to put down."
5,Captivating,This was a captivating story. I found it hard to put down. It's a story of Blair Smith as they grow up in a small town in Virginiaduring the 30's and 40's. As he shares his experiences you get a snapshot of life as it was during that time in history. A good read.I would highly recommend it.
4,"Great Rod, Great Price...way too much packaging","This rod is a good buy for the price. It's very stylish.It's black finish and wood ends blend in perfectly with my living room. However, I'll think twice before ordering such items from Amazon since it's comes in way too much packaging.It was wrapped up in 3 card board boxes and lots and lots of plastic bubble wrap. What a waste of cardboard!"
3,A French new wave classic,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Made in U.S.A, directed by Jean-luc Goddard is about a French writer who goes to meet her lover, bud discovers that he is dead and attemps to investigate her death.Many of the film's characters have the same names as real life famous people.I found the film hard to follow because of its editing style but liked how it was made.The supplements include interviews with actors Anna Karina and Lászlo Szábó, a video essay about the film, a piece about the political elements in the film and its companion piece, ""2 or 3 Things I Know About Her."" Also included are the film's original theatrical trailer and it's rerelease trailer."
1,WARNING: What you see is NOT what you get.,"I did not receive the antique-style cards shown in the illustration. Instead, I received an ordinary deck of cards that you could purchase in any dollar store with Jack Daniels label design on the back. Don't be mislead."
2,Low quality.,I like the custom backs and aces.The cards are low quality. After 1 day of use they were already beat up from shuffling.
2,1/2 decent if unremarkable & 1/2 truly wretched,"The two stars is for Road to Ruin only!! It's a decent story although somewhat slow. A fake marriage of convenience, a false charge of murder, and a trumped-up scandal -- plenty to work with here.Metzger's 3 short stories, however, are abysmal. The first is mildly entertaining only becuase if the hero's terror of losing his hair. The second is fairly interesting even though the reader can sense what's going on from the very start, until the the end when the revelation of the truth makes absolutely no difference. The third story is so ridiculous that I can't even discuss it. One word will suffice--Elvis! Egads! All 3 equal a big fat zero."
4,Great Italian Dance Production!,"One of the best dance italian production of the end of 90s!Singles extracted from the album: Restless (1998), Shock (1998), The Game (1999), Fairytale (2000). all n.1 on italian dance charts!maximum price to spend for this album (10-12$)"
2,More Corn & Cheese Than A Bag Of Cheetos Mixed With Doritos,"Anyone in their right mind, especially a black man/woman would find this movie degrading and insulting. This is coming from someone who is not black, but watches this movie set black people back 100 years. From the domineering husband to the fake African homage. Then to top it off, they make black people seem like they have no sense at all.I mean, you got the father, who talks in a fake English accent. Then the mother who acts like a total victim in the whole movie. Plus add the recluse brother and the political activist brother, especially with their constant bickering and you have got another civil war type movie, only modern and black. The people who made this move need to crawl back in a cave and stay there....."
1,Not in color,As I received the DVD first time I saw that the film isn't in color as described on the package! I sent it back and ordered a new one. The new DVD is also in black and white and not in color! I'm not very satisfied about this!
3,A Few Exciting Places,"Jaime Seattle, WAOverall this was a well made film. It could have delved more into the organization of the mau maus and why they rose up against the white settlers like they did. I wondered how accurate the use of the whistle is when they did their home invasions."
2,okay camcorder with consolidated features,"I bought this camera from the HSN.com for... with an upgraded 16MB removable memory. The picture quality of the video is better than a VHS-C camcorder but not better than the ANY Sony 8mm camcorder. Don't let the 400X digital zoom open your eyes. A Sony with 320X digital zoom doesnt break-up compared to the RCA w/ 400x. The still feature of the RCA is only good for close ups with good lighting. It is 480x640. This is one of the lowest resolution settings on cheap digital cameras. I believe that this is equivalent to 0.3 megapixels. For the price it is okay. But for... you are better buying a Sony 8mm camcorder at Walmart for... and then the 2.1 megapixel Sony digital camera for the same price. Unless you want an easy 1 step camera, the RCA 9373 may be you answer."
4,Lots of Suspense,"Who cares if this movie is supposed to be no good! I've seen it a couple of times and I find it mysterious, moody, visually lush and interesting, and suspenseful. And I can't remember when Scheider was better (except, maybe, in JAWS). Don't let Maltin's review scare you off this one -- I think it is a great rainy-Saturday-afternoon movie."
3,not just hitchcock,"Wife and I saw it on MGM showcase high-def cable channel-- (1) We had no expectations. (2) We enjoyed it. (3) I'm no cineaste, but while it's certainly a Hitchcock homage (Streep had fun being a Hitchcock blonde), there are also clear hat-tips to other psych-out thrillers, notably ""Don't Look Now"" and ""Cat People."" (4) Overall, a lesser effort from the director and cast, and as folks say fairly cold, but glimpses of young naked Meryl Streep were hot, the denoument turned out to be a surprise after all, the dream sequence was gripping and creepy, and despite a certain by-the-numbers quality, including a few too many sudden ""gotcha!-made-ya-jump!""s, it was genuinely suspenseful, with a couple of unexpected turns.Movies on TV are like diners in a strange town you're passing through: in this one the food was edible-to-tasty, and I was glad I'd stopped. While I wouldn't drive very far out of my way, and I'd probably try something else from the menu, I'd stop at such a diner again."
4,Misleading,"Very misleading. By looking at the ad for this product one is certain to think that the tattoos you are ordering are the ones pictured, not blank ones that you have to print yourself through a complicated bunch of downloads and such. IT should be represented as blank tattoos period.Very disappointed in this product."
1,No Software available!!! Waste of money!,"I thought that these were actual cases by the pictures given under product. They turned out to be printable labels with no software available to use with them. So not only did I waste my money, but I wasted my time trying to find the software it said was available. I will never buy this product or a product from this company again. False advertising."
1,Upset Customer,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is a rip off I would like my money back....you can't print off the images because you can't download the pictures because the soft ware doesn't exist anymore!
4,Very Cool,"I would have rated it 5 stars, however, use of the ""clear transfer sheet"" is tricky. I ended up just carefully applying the tattoo without it, and it came out great. The printing does not rub off at all (as one customer reported); it would definitely rub off of the ""practice sheet"" or the clear sheet, but maybe it was due due to the type of printer used, i.e., laser. It is meant for inkjet printers only. Anyway, I downloaded the software and then used my own .jpg files. It looks so cool. I'm ordering a new pack to use on my friend's phone. Additionally, the tattoos stay on, however, they can be peeled off, so I plan to change the tattoo when I want something different."
2,Buyer Beware (If you own a Mac)!,"The software that is enclosed with this product is only usable on a PC. The software is needed in order to design your phone tattoo and in order to communicate with your printer (correct printing). Perhaps, I should have checked to confirm that the software was compatible with Macs. I didn't realize that the software was basically THE ONLY WAY to get these tattoos designed and printed. So if you do not have a PC do not even bother buying this; unless you are crafty and decide to design it by hand with markers."
1,Not what I thought it would be,"I thought I was getting the tattoo that was shown on the page, but it turns out it was blank and I had to go online and choose a pattern tattoo and then print it. That was fine but the print I wanted was not even there to pick so I feel I wasted my time and money. So just beware...."
1,I was sent the wrong item,I was very unhappy due to not receiving the item in question. What was sent to me was the blank sheets for me to make my own tattoos. I am very unsatified.
5,"Not ""just a sticker""","When I first saw this item I was at a cingular store so it didn't surprise me that the sales person recommeded it. I mean what else would he say!.....But over the last 5 months I have been pleasantly surprised.....I sware the thing is like a second skin. I got three in the package and figured I would change my phone's look every few weeks.......NOPE....It's not like a run of the mill sticker, it's awesome. It doesn't fade, tear, bubble, rolled up or fray around the edges. It really wears WELL. I'm on my second ""phone tatoo"" and changed it only cause I wanted to. Why pay more for a specific color? Get whatever is on sale and customize!!! this is way better!"
3,Don't be fooled like me!,The pictures of the three designs of phone tattoos are not pictures of what you will receive when you order this product. These are pictures of another product you can buy from Motorola or at the store in which you bought your RAZR. You will really receive what the name says customizable tattoos that you make with your own graphics on your computer and printer. You will not receive a cool pink or other designed tattoo for your phone. I wish I would have realized this before I put it on my wish-list.
2,COLOR RUBS OFF ON YOUR HANDS,"After purchasing this product (downloading, building the tattoo, printing, peeling, etc.) the ink will rub off on your hands. Poor choice of tattoo paper they send you. It's a fairly easy product to design and put on your phone, but after making 3 more tattoos, the ink rubbed off of those as well. Didn't last one day. Great product if the color would stick."
4,Bissell 464 Scotchgard,"I wish Bissell still supported this product with there Pro-Heat model carpet shampoo machines. However though getting harder to find this product, it still works when applied to protect carpets from stains."
4,Excellent history of a most misunderstood man,"David Horowitz has done an excellent job of detailing the ministry of Pastor Charles Taze Russell ... too often documented as ""the founder of the Jehovah's Witnesses"", this book shows that Russell is in no way their founder. The work Pastor Russell has done towards the Jewish people, is unfounded today. And the Jehovah's Witnesses who claim him as their founder have turned their backs not only on him, but on God's chosen people, the Jews. This book is recommended to all interested in learning about Charles Taze Russell, and his ministry towards the Jewish people, and how today the association he founded, [Associated Bible Students - biblestudents] continue his work in comforting God's covenanted people."
3,Don't waste your money,"The film was excellent, don't get me wrong. It was the quality of the video that ruined my enjoyment of it. I first saw the film in college during a film studies class, and it remains to be one of the coolest films ever. However, the video was grainy and sometimes it was hard to make out the subtitles. If you've never seen Le Jetee before, don't buy this video. See it on the big screen when it'll be shown with good quality film. Otherwise, you'll end up thinking that this film is lesser than it actually is.It's surprising that with the popularity of this film and the technologies available presently that the subtitles weren't in yellow or another more visible color, and the transcription of video was so poor. I know there is a DVD version, but it's dubbed and what made Le Jetee special was its quiet Frenchness."
4,"Stylistic, Futuristic short film that sets the standard.","I originally saw this short as part of a film festival in Toronto. The stylistic black and white photographs, overlayed with sound and music to create a complex emotion and story, were quite mature and forward thinking for its time.I also believe this to be a major inspiration for Millennium, although, only for it's costumes, style, and voice.I recommend seeing this in the original language with subtitles if possible. This was consequently the source material for 12 Monkeys, although they are substantially different in tone and emotion.While this is also on DVD in ""Short 2"", I recommend you watch the VHS version here, as the english narration on the DVD is quite distracting."
5,Breathtaking!,"Who would have thought that a 30 minute film made up almost entirely of still images could be one of the most riveting films ever made? The print on this VHS copy is old and dirty, and the subtitles sometimes fade into the background, but no matter; five minutes into this film and you'll forget about the problems with the print.To say any more about it would give away too much of the story. Suffice it to say that this is one of the truely great science fiction films."
4,Great flick; lousy transfer; find the DVD,"(Five stars if the transfer had been at all worthwhile...) This is one of the most influential movies I've seen in a long time - I've shown it to everyone I could collar. And yet I've always had to wince when I show it - the transfer to video is so bad, I have to read the subtitles to them (which I can only manage because I've seen it so often). Many of the scenes are full of ""noise,"" the contrast fades, etc. So if you can find a copy on DVD (it was released as one of many shorts on a DVD-based magazine, ""Short Cinema Journal""), then do that. Otherwise, buy this film!"
5,one of the best films i've seen,"i saw this film in an art class at the art institute of chicago. my teacher had been talking about it for weeks. when i saw it though, i was completely taken aback. la jetee is an amazing work of art. it's simplicity (a series of stills with a voice over) makes it very original and the sheer beauty of the whole film will amaze you. i HIGHLY recommend this film to anyone who can get their hands on it!"
4,Magnifique Marker,"It's true; the picture quality is poor to middling. But all the more evocative for it. I haven't seen any version other than VHS, so I don't know what I'm missing. But it was a captivating film."
3,Great Film - Poor Copy,This is a classic film that I first saw on 16mm during college. The bad news is that here the conversion to video is very poor. You can't really appreciate the best sequence in the film (the only true video for those who have seen it).
5,Lovely quiet dreamy book,"I read the tattered library copy of this book to my daughter for years. I'm thrilled it is re-published. It is the story of a fanciful, silly, invented world."
4,Great book!,"After coming back from Greece and having visited the site of Delphi's Temple of Apollo and Temple of Athena, it was so fascinating to read this book and learn so much of the history of the legends and mythology, as well as read a modern scientific endeavor story about how geology and chemistry can still make an impact in the understanding of what was suggested to have happened there. I wish I had read this book before going to Greece!"
4,Fabulous Historical and Scientific Evidence,This book is great for anyone researching the Delphinic Oracle tradition. It also sheds light on a very economically legitimate career path for women in ancient Greece. I used this book for research while writing a young adult historical fiction novel. I was not disappointed.
3,a Good read,"At first I was afraid that this book by William Broad was going to tell me more about the Oracle than I really wanted to know and was beginning to get bogged down in it. Then, I began to get what he was really about and enjoyed reading it. It tells you abaou the configuration of the area and why the faults produced such dramatic results during the days of the Oracle. I did enjoy reading it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Wars"" and ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms"""
4,Read it together with your daughter,Are you looking for a bonding experience for you and your daughter? Read the Divine Dance together and form your own mother/daughter book club.Reading it together you will be able to reinforce the positive lessons that are taught in this book.I highly recommend it.Keleigh Crigler Hadley- author [...]
2,Over-rated. Under Written.,"Do you want to be turned in circles, round and round again only to end up where you started and no better for the journey? That's the way I felt about this book. I read it twice, but was still in the dark! I bought this book on a glowing recommendation, but really felt cheated. Maybe it's just me, but I just couldn't figure out what this guy was getting at---and I've read and enjoyed MANY good new age books, so that wasn't the problem. I had the very distinct impression he was trying to make the draconian rules & ugliness of the bible more palatable. But to me it was like perfume on a stinking body. To his credit though, he wrote this back in the dark ages when you probably couldn't sell anything that didn't sound Christian without being branded a witch. But today there are many more, and I feel, better choices.Of course, if you like your New Age philosophy dressed in Christian sounding garb, go for it. I'll take the real thing, thank you."
3,wounded 1 wereling series,There where some rips & tears nothing major came from a library so stickers all over it & stamps in it for the price good choice since its still readable
5,the rols royce book of that sbject!,"there are many books on the topic juice book, and non of them that i have seen ,is coming near that book. this book is giving the reader the knoledge of the nutrition values, as well as the therapeutic aspects of each single fruit or vegetable, as well as for the mixed fruits and or vegetables as a healthy healing juices. there is also a section of diseases that are treated by specific fruits or vegetables juice combination.the reason of the healing properties for each juice is also explain in a very simple, and easy to understand,plus a small section that is telling you what kind of a juicer is the most suitable to your specific needs.in short, and in general, this book is a comprehansive yet simple and correct, and easy to follow book,and you have my best recommandation.i am on my way to the juicer."
5,One of the best DJs in the US!,"If you like trance at all, you will love this CD! I picked this CD up just because I recognized a few names (Lange, Tukan, Green Court). I hadn't dove into progressive trance completely and the trance I knew were like Lasgo, Fragma, Sylver, Dee Dee, etc. And when I began listening to it, it was great! Then I was amazed with how well the songs were blended. I hate picking up a compilation CD that is mixed and blended badly. This was DEFINIETLY not. This compilation introduced me to so many great songs, I now have bought about half of them as CDMs (the only reason for not buying the other half is because I can't find them). You will not be disappointed in this one.Favorite Tracks:Vivien G. - ShineDJ Session One - Ocean of EmotionHemstock & Jennings - Mirage of HopeDrax & Scott Mac - AngelAltitude - Altitude"
5,Missy cat loves these!,"Missy cat loves these mice. She chews them, flings them everywhere and always loses them. I just bought these and have zero idea where she has placed them!!"
5,My Cat Loves These,"These are pretty durable toys and my cat just loves them. My cat doesn't really chew on them, but the mesh on the outside seems to increase the durability of these toys and they are easier to grab and play with. I would definitely recommend these to any cat owner."
4,Picky Cats,"Giving it 4 stars because only one of my cats like them, and they were a little smaller than I expected. One of my cats will have absolutely nothing to do with these, my other cat absolutely loves them and goes crazy for them. Just depends on the cat. :)"
2,No interest from my cat,"I bought these mice hoping Pet Stages' claim is true about them helping to reduce tartar. My cat has a furry mouse toy filled with catnip, and she loves it. I put that one away and replaced it with a chew mouse. It remained in the same place for several days. I dangled it in front of her and tossed it, but she wouldn't touch it. She didn't sniff it or bat it with her paw out of curiosity. I even used catnip spray on the chew mouse, since she goes crazy for anything I spray. Still no interest. So these chew mice will be donated to a thrift store which supports an animal shelter."
3,Meh...,"Cats hardly touched these. The regular furry mice, they love those much more. They didn't play with these very much. Mediocre, at best."
1,Cats not interested,"Unfortunately, my cats have never showed any interest in these mice. I got them because one of my cats chews everything in sight, but they have never played with these."
5,what is it about the chew mice?,i send cat toys to my friends in NM routinely. i got a call today that the celebrated chew mice are missing. The NM cats have so many toys but the chew mice are the most loved and played with. i placed another order....
2,"Interesting side notes, but not worth the effort","One interesting thing this book contains is little sidebar interviews with people from the game industry. It might serve people who are looking for jobs and want to get names of people in industry.This book might also be a good read for parents of kids who want to learn more about the gaming industry. It is a very simple introduction (hence the title).For anyone who has played computer games however, it will be overly simple and offer little value add.It really is an intro and nothing more."
3,Slightly dated textbook,"This book was published in 2005, and at the pace the game world changes it's now slightly dated. The book is a good source of information about game creation if you are very much a beginner and have no idea about how to go about designing, marketing, or the elements that go into creating a good game and want to know what's in store for you as a game designer.The book is well-written, textbook-style, and a reasonably good overview of the gaming world as it existed in 2005. It's an interesting scan-through for older gamers and a very good tool for the younger, inexperienced gamer/designer.I got the book remaindered for less than $4 and feel it was probably worth that, but I wouldn't advise spending anything more for it at this time. The accompanying disc has only trial versions and includes GameMaker, a newer version of which is available on-line from Yo-Yo Games for free."
5,Excellent book,It's an excellent book. The fact that she included my incredibly detailed game design document in no way influenced my rating.
4,Game Dev. Ess. Book,"Good book if you ONLY need introduction to Game Development. If you want much detail, you will need to look further."
5,Required for school,"Aside from needing the book for school, it has some very interesting info about the gaming company, and some current games."
4,GREAT Bubble but not for my tall 6 year old.,"I got this product in medium for my 4 year old and large for my 6 year old. It is a great system for learning to swim and my son's have more confidence in the water now.The only issue I have with this product is the fit. I bought a large for my 6 year old because it is in his weight range, I had not taken into consideration that he is 4'3"" tall (98th percentile for his age). The strap that goes between his legs is too short and the bubble doesn't pull all the way up as a result. Needless to say, he cannot wear the strap between his legs. This product may not be suitable for taller kids. I am going to write to Power Swimr to suggest an adjustable strap.My 4 year old who is average height and weight for his age fits his perfectly."
2,Didn't live up to the description,"I was really excited about this product when I first saw it. I thought it would be just what I needed for my son who can not swim at all. We took it on vacation with us. First of all the item is a little hard to get on and the strap that goes between the child's legs was a little uncomfortable for my son. I thought from reading the packaging that it would hold my child up in the water like a floatation device, but it really didn't. It was a waste of money to me, he got more use out of a {few dollars} floating noodle thing. I would not recommend the purchase of this item."
3,Tall kids beware...,"I think this product is really great. It's comfortable to wear, stays put in the right position on the body, and it is very easy to remove flotation as your child becomes a more confidant swimmer. My only issue with the Power Swimr is the crotch strap. My son is well within the weight range specified, but at 48"" tall, the strap is just too short. So short that when extended to it's full length the Power Swimr was around his belly instead of higher up on his chest where it should be. I contacted Swimways Customer Service and was informed that extensions are not available. My child is confidant enough in the water that I just removed the strap all together. It still stays put and I am happy with it's performance otherwise."
5,CLASSIC FRED WILLIAMSON!!!!,THIS is an awesome movie and I would truly recommend this to any Fred Williamson fan who enjoys his movies and I loved this movie it was pretty good Julius W. Harris and Gloria Hendry returns also and she is a very beautiful woman and they are very good legendary actors and actresses and this movie is really good I would really recommend Tommy Gibbs falls in love again with a minister by the name of Jennifer and may I also add that this is a nice soundtrack also this time this soundtrack is done by Edwin Starr and this is the sequel to Black Caesar !!!!h
1,lotta ole ballecks,this is what i baste my knew vido on... it is my favurit vido of all tyme... it is good... like pamela anderson in baywatch... no?
4,GREAT LISTENING,GREAT OLDIES AND EASY LISTENING. KAREN DOES PUT HER HEART AND SOUL IN EACH SONG.Jer and Sal
3,A not-as charged and less focused Hammer's Slammers,"Shelley is good. Not a great introduction to the military-sf genre, but certainly a good addition. Definitely worth the read; but I felt like I was reading early David Drake. Certainly worth picking up this and Jump Pay, I figure"
2,"Cute idea, mediocre execution","First off let's be clear what you're getting here, this is a B&W; reprint shrunk down to digest size. If you're looking for the full color full sized reprint you want this book:LoveBunny & Mr. Hell Volume 1 TPIt's a cute idea, Love Bunny is a ditzy neurotic former kid sidekick who dresses like a Playboy bunny, Mr. Hell is a demon she befriended. Together they fight crime.But once writer/artist Tim Seely sets up the plot there's really no where to go. A lot of the humor is repetitive and Love Bunny never develops more of a personality than nice but dumb.Adam Warren's Empowered series draws on a lot of the same themes but is a lot funnier and has much more engaging characters.I'd give this one a miss."
4,"Good service, a bit worn though","The book itself is really good, i've always been a big fan of lovebunny and mr. hell. The book was slightly more worn that I would have liked, but that's what you get for buying used."
5,Very Cute!,"These earrings are great for any Jeep lovers like myself. I was SO excited to see them, and they are just as cute as I had hoped. They are small, so they don't look like I'm a little kid wearing SUV earrings. I love them."
3,So-So,"Seeing as there are little or no biographies out there about Lupe Velez, I guess this one will have to do. The book seems to concentrate more on her directors, costars, lovers, etc. with only little snippets about Lupe herself. I wish I could say I completely loved this book, but...nah..."
3,A nice reference for idiots like me!,"Since starting a class where I have to make internet pages, I've realized that I know diddly squat about anything beyond the very basics & nothing about the programs such as VB. In fact, the first time I saw the Visual Basic program I almost hyperventilated because it all looked so foreign & crazy.Thank goodness for the 'Dummies' books! There were lots of nice references in the books for me to use. The only problem is well... sometimes there wasn't a lot of explanation for parts of the code & that's not very helpful if you actually want to understand what you are putting in! If I wanted to just copy down random code, I could've done that from the internet for free!Still, there's lots of helpful bits & pieces in here, so it did help me overall with the course. I just recommend for any potential buyers that they find a copy to look through first before plunking down the money for it. You may find that other books could be more helpful than this one is!"
4,A Good Album with a HIDDEN TRACK..TRACK 17!,"There's not alot to say that the other reviews didn;t say already..BUT I WILL say that my copy of this has a HIDDEN track! Track 17 is the song "" I COULD BE GOOD FOR YOU"" from 707's first album, which was a moderate hit here in the Cincinnati Ohio area along with the song ""MEGAFORCE"".I don't much of their music but now I have the two songs I like alreadyon 1 CD!"
3,The mug was orderd as a replacement. The one I received did not have the same 'sayings' as the mug displayed.,The mug was ordered as a replacement. The one I received did not have the same 'sayings' as the mug displayed
3,Good starting point,"I've read most anything I can get my hands on about PCOS for the last 5-6 years. While this was an informative book, it wasn't anything new to me. If you're newly diagnosed and looking for some information, this is probably a good book for you. But if you are already fairly knowledgable about PCOS, I'd skip it."
5,Great Book,"I've known I've had PCOS for 4 years and discovered after reading this that my doctor is completely clueless. Thanks to this book, I'm seeing a different doctor, changed my lifestyle, and am now on the path to living a longer, healther life!!"
3,A Patient's Guide to PCOS,"Thank God there is more material on this syndrome affecting at least 1 in every 100 women. The diet plan though was a bit ""impossible."" I hope this book and others like it will inform America that these women (my daughter) need more than just a ""diabetic diet"" and ""diabetic exercise program"" as the book clearly indicates in its recommendations. We are members at C_____s, and its circuit program wasn't enough cardio for PCOS affected women. They hadn't heard of it at our local center. So I let them know about it there and on their site. Still they say the 30 minute circuit works for most women-why not all women. PCOS women need a minimum of 45 minutes of cardio in addition to any resistance exercises available in circuit exercises. I hope this review will emphasize the value of the book but also enlighten others. Thanks for this book."
2,Mildly Informative,"The book offers a good synopsis of PCOS. However there are overly technical details (reference chapter 2 regarding types of blood tests, etc.) which pad the pages and make for unuseful reading to the lay person. The book comes across as more of a work in progress rather than a serious paper on the topic. Items are repetitive throughout which again appears as page-padding. Mention is made of one particular subject that was to appear later on in the text (i.e. how PCOS will impact on your female fetus) however, this never materialises. The author clearly has a passion for the subject, but unfortunately the text is poorly articulated."
3,Good Book,"Very informative, if you have this condition like I do you must be looking for this book because you just want to know more. This book will definitely help you to understand. Though I don't agree with the approach of medications for helping this condition along it is a good read none the less. Diet and excercise is key. The insulin resistance diet is a good book that will help you to better address PCOS naturally vs. taking pills each and every day which I don't think is necessary."
4,"Works, but could be longer and better designed","It does the job of being able to slide theTopeak MTX Rear Bicycle Basketoff and on theTopeak Explorer Bicycle Rack with Disc Brake Mounts, but it could be about 6 inches longer to accommodate the fourth set of mounting holes in the basket. It looks like Topeak had the left hand creating the basket and the right hand creating the Fixer 6.By not utilizing all of the mounting holes in the basket, it tends to bend backwards a bit. I fixed that problem by wedging a piece of wood under the basket and screwing it into the basket. But, the basket still sways to the left and right because it is only being held by the middle and the screen mesh of the basket allows it to flex too much. This could have been fixed by adding a bit of support to the sides of the Fixer 6.Anyway, if you are looking to attach your Topeak basket and use it for light duty then this is for you. 40+ pounds of backpack?? No way."
2,Why so small?,"I really don't understand why this fixer was designed so much shorter than the track itself. I have attached a milk crate to it (the Topeak wire basket seemed smaller than I wanted and too flimsy. This was not a 5 minute project, as I had to work a piece of scrap wood into an adapter plate, since the milk crate would never have safely attached directly to the fixer). After about a year of occasional use the milk crate is constantly becoming more unstable. I feel like the whole setup would be more stable if the fixer made use of the full length of the Topeak rear track and sat flat on the sides of the rack rather than leaving the sides of the mounted object hanging so far out."
2,works as advertised,"It works as advertised, it should have a locking feature built in, at least it should be optional. Would only recommend if you don't ride your bike to anyplace you want to lock it."
5,Hoping it comes out on DVD,"This is truly one of the great biographical documentaries. Even if you are not familiar with Buster Keaton's film masterpieces; a viewing of ""A Hard Act to Follow"" will surely entice the viewer to delve into Keaton films. A great documentary on a great filmmaker.I hope this will one day be released on DVD."
5,Excellent Product,"This opener is sturdy and well made. Mounts on a vertical wall, like it is supposed to. There are other items on Amazon that are advertised as wall mount openers but are actually for under sink (meant to be mounted horizontally)."
4,Woody goes bananas!,This is surely in the top 5 funniest film ever! The scene where he buys porn is laugh out loud funny.
3,Entertaining spoof,"This 1971 satire has little in the way of plot, but is amusing enough, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. Noticeably more chaotic and lowbrow than subsequent offerings, but seeds of the later, more sophisticated Allen are discernible nonetheless."
3,A Decent Slapstick,"Though by no means Woody's best movie , if you are stuck with an hour and a half to kill you could do worse .Woody plays his usual bumbling , neurotic ,weirdo persona while Louise Lasser (his first wife) plays a pouty,voluptuous feminist .The quality of the comedy is mostly slapstick with few of the trenchant existential wisecracks for which we admire movies like ""Hanna & her sisters"", ""Annie Hall"" & ""Manhattan"" etc etc ."
5,"It's a coin toss, but I think this is Woody's best!","With kudos for Sleeper, Crimes and Misdemeanors, and Bullets over Broadway, I'm giving Bananas, with Woody in his most zaniest self, the top spot. Although I like the reflective depth he gave to the later pictures mentioned, the tour-de-force neurotic Woody is the purest distillation. I place Woody second only to the Marx Brothers, although he does have several over-indulgent outings which distract from his reputation (although most in the last five years have been solid, if not spectacular, efforts). Thanks for the humor Woody!"
2,Yipes!,"It seems that all of you really love this film, but I feel that it is the weakest Woody Allen ever. Yeah, Take the Money and Run and Sleeper were funny, but Bananas is such an un-focused film. The timing is off, and the characters are weak. Don't get me wrong, I love Woody Allen, but it feels as if he tried to put the same gags from Take the Money and Run onto another plot. If only the timing was better and the whole thing was more focused."
4,25 Years?,"I think it's been twenty-five years since I've seen this. The cigarette ad spoof was side-splitting; I'd forgotten about that. The courtroom scene is even better than I remembered. The Coen Brothers must have studied that before they wrote Intolerable Cruelty. I remember Allen's comedy books better than his films and several of those book gags are present in the film. I love ""The Rebel Song.""--the quintessence of the absurd. What about raiding the village for food? And visiting his parents, the surgeons? LOL! Yeah, funny stuff. I watched it twice."
1,The only DVD I've ever thrown away,"I bought this DVD because of the genuinely funny picture of Allen in his Castro outfit on the cover. Believe me, that's the biggest laugh you're gonna get from this clunker. It appears to have been shot on Super-8 by a rank amateur and the waaaay dated humor (sorry, Howard Cosell is NOT funny) falls as flat as a set of Firestone tires. If this is funny, then I'm Groucho Marx. Not just bad, but incredibly bad. I was embarrassed to watch it -- and I was alone! This one begged for a one-way ticket to the nearest landfill. I was happy to oblige."
2,I am sure it is a great film but only if you speak both French and Russian,Shame. Seems like a great film but can't seem to find the English subtitles.If indeed they are not provided in this copy that might be a good thing to mention.
2,Disappointed at cuts,"If anyone knows how to find the original Emmanuelle 2: The Joys of a Woman, please email me. I was very disappointed at the cuts made on this supposedly restored version. The NC 17 rating made me believe that this was the uncut version. None of the original movie was so hardcore or explicit as to force the producers of this version to cut it. Call me a perfectionist, but the original movie was an erotic masterpiece, very artsy and with a feminine sensibility at its heart, which makes it a pleasure for couples viewing together. This version is still very good, but if you saw uncut version first you might find this a bit tame."
1,Amazon think I bought this...,"And I did actually buy Emmanuelle 1 on bluray and 2 on DVD before... But my DVD version of Emmanuelle 2 that is in the PAL system, has the truly delicious bath house scene and the film would be a huge dissapointment without that scene, so I surely understand the other reviewers rage here - when that scene got cut away!!"
3,"Beware, this is a Technical manual","I bought this thinking I could beef-up my knowledge on DVD-Audio and SACD. This is not what your looking for for in-depth info, its more of a technical engineers manual if anything with hardly any info on DVD-A or SACD with very, very small articles on these topics. I has more charts and technical data on very scientific data that only an engineer can decipher. Its put out by the people at Sony and Philips and gives you the same info that you can get in a tech magazine. Save your money, its not worth it."
4,Low-budget comedy at its best!,"Love this movie.I just wished the DVD was better. This one is 4x3, full-frame. Boo. Nonetheless, I love this movie. I think it's hilarious. Very basic, very simple, playing on the popularity of following celebrities on ""True Hollywood Story"" as a concept, Jamie Kennedy is perfect as the desperate writer. And so is Loren Dean, he's great, perfect as a coke-head loser actor."
4,Starstruck,"I first saw this movie in the early 1980s when it was new. I just saw it again last night. It still has a quaint charm about it even though the music is quite dated. The movie reminds me of real Australian music from this era, Devo and Men at Work. It's their version of techno-rock but it still has somewhat of an appeal to me.Jackie and her ever optimistic younger cousin, Angus, will do just about anything to achieve a level of stardom. Eventually they take over an amateur talent show and win $25K which we presume is enough to save the family business. The storyline is relatively weak, but its a musical. Nobody realy seems to be hopelessly miscastand the movie proceeds at a steady pace.It may be another 25 years before I see it again (or will want to) but that's fine by me. Who knows, it may still have some charm in another quarter century."
4,Kitch 80's musical video with a great soundtrack!,"Filmed in Australia, this film is not renown for the acting, but rather the great music featuring 'The Swingers'. Amongst cast members, a fleeting performance from Geoffrey Rush, future star of 'Shine'. Worth a look if you like musicals and early eighties style music. Don't bother if you prefer an intellectual storyline!"
1,Fascinatingly Awful...,"I saw this film in my teens and couldn't believe just how bad it was. Now in my 40's, it's a stunner of a bad film that belongs right up there with the Golan-Globus musical disaster ""The Apple"". Every musical number is jaw-dropping bad. This film is a product of the 80's and should have remained there."
5,Great movie!!,I can't believe this isn't offered by Amazon anymore! Glad I bought it when I did. I'm very happy with my purchase. The movie is so hilarious. I saw when I was younger and enjoyed it and love it even more as an adult. Wonderful cast. Just pure comedy.
4,Still a Fun Romp,"Slightly dated, conventional story, but still good with memorable performances by all the main characters. A feel good movie when you need cheering up on a sad day."
5,Classic Romantic Comedy,This is such a great movie. I'm happy to finally own it. Ted Danson is hilarious!
5,Art for the body as well as the mouth and eye,"This sumptuous resource combines gorgeous photos, healthy recipes and sumptuous ideas about good nutrition. If you've ever tried to get your child to eat fruit and veggies without McJunk, this book is for you.Linda Davis Kyle, a nutrition writer with creative ideas galore, has cooked up a fascinating batch of recipes. They carry names like ""Pepper Treasure Chest"" and ""Kiwi Flying Saucers.""Part craft project, part foodie's delight, part nutritional reference book and part game, Fun Foods in your kitchen will make you look good in more ways than one."
4,Our Humble God,Ilia Delio's book provides a good insight into a Christian spirituality that places God as squarely on and by our side today. This is a good book for someone to relook or even reignite their Christian faith. Good scholarship but written for everyone.While it comes from a Catholic and Franciscan perspective this book clearly looks through the franciscan tradition of focusing on the Christ of the Gospel making it useful for Christians of every domination.A good book to give someone who is on a spiritual journey.
5,Great show!,"You just can't beat these old television shows. At their worst, they are 10 times better than the crap that is produced today. The show has very good acting, good character development and well written stories and dialogue. I highly recommend this show to anyone looking for something of quality to watch, which is very difficult to find nowadays."
3,"Good, but lightweight","I like it because I like McGavin and the whole Western genre, but its really a run of the mill adventure series where most episodes follow the same path: a crisis on one of the Riverboats trips up or down the Mississippi. And sometimes the action is so relentless that there's little time for drama or character development. Anyway, it desrves its place alongside Bronco, Cheyenne and the like."
5,RIVERBOAT THE COMPLETE SERIES 44 EPISODES,"this is the best dvd i have ever ordered to have the whole series is fantastic the last time i saw the series was when it was releasd in australia in about 1960 and i have not seen it since so i dont remember any of the episodes,with 35 hours of viewingit takes along time to view the lot.biggest bargain of all time. cheers JOHN MOLLOY"
3,Well worth the price,"Good presentation of a memorable series, amazing to see both leads this young. Wonder where the Riverboat ""Enterprise"" is today?"
5,Good backup plan,"For months and months I waited for a backordered Puig windscreen. 14 months after placing my order, I decided to give up on that dream and try this ZG one instead, and I have to say, I am impressed.It lacks the ultimate quality of the Puig IMO, however, it looks mean as hell (bike has aftermarket body, 100% black) and has near OEM quality. It is amaig how something like this can change the whole look of the bike, and I would recommend this to anyone wanting a Puig... or otherwise. Fitment was great, and it's hard to go wrong here.Get it. Right now. Ladies love tinted screens. That is 1000% fact."
4,Good Made-For-TV Movie,My husband and I were on a real-life serial killer kick this week and watched everything we could find on the subject from Helter Skelter to Citizen X. Although not the best of these movies it was still quite watchable and well done. What was greatly appreciated was the lack of graphic details which can rapidly turn this type of movie from a semi-documentary into a horror flick. The tape quality was a little fuzzy but that is to be expected from a VHS tape. We were quite pleased with our purchase and more than pleased with the speed in which it was delivered.
5,Reads like a novel. Great page-turner.,"This book kept me up until 4 in the morning, laughing, crying. It's got it all. RCAF navigator McIntosh wrote with pathos and honesty. He puts you right inside the Mosquito with his Jewish/American pilot, with whom he had a kind of Butch & Sundance relationship, all that same kind of loyalty and snappy reparte. This is one of the best WWII books I've ever read. Just like with a great suspense novel, you'll find yourself really whipping those pages over. And yet, I was sorry it had to end."
5,Always Nice to Have a Spare,I purchased this bible because I wanted one small enough to carry around with me. Mission accomplished. I would also recommend this bible for other customers.
3,"Life Application Study Bible, Personal Size: New Living Translation, Personal Size",I like the bible but the print is too small to read & make reference
2,Print is too small.,"I have this same translation, but is larger in size and the font is also larger. This particular bible is very hard to read because of the font size."
4,"Good Bible, Easy to read",I like the new living because it is easy to read and is more modern language.
3,life applic study Bible,"I absolutely love this Bible. The Study notes are really great. The only thing I don't like is that the print, especially in the footnotes, is very small and hard for me to read. The advertised ""personal size"" was not very descriptive."
5,Good small Bible to carry,I enjoy using this Bible. It has all the larger ones have but it is so much easier to carry. I love the Life Application Bible!
3,Nice but limited,Works well; certainly no design or product defects. Its one serving capacity makes its thermal holding feature meaningless.
5,Elegant but Sturdy French Press,I bought this french press for work and it's the perfect size for one cup of coffee. It's sturdy and is made well. I have broken a lot of glass French presses so this perfect for those of you who are a bit rougher on your press pots.
4,Lovely,"I love my new French Press. It definitely is worth the price - the stainless steel holds up so much better than any other design I have ever owned. It certainly keeps my coffee warm longer than other models, but not quite as long as some would want."
3,Too small,"I bought this item for my husband, since he is the only coffee drinker in the house and only drinks one mug of coffee a day. I had previously bought the 12-cup one, based on the other reviews, so that if we have company he can make more than one cup. The 12-cup was too big for one mug, but the 3-cup was too small. He said he filled it to the top, but didn't get a full mug of coffee. I assume this mean his mug is 16 oz. So, if you like a big mug of coffee,I would recommend the 8-cup version of the french press. Other than the size, my husband loves it."
4,"Adorable, but small","This pot really only makes one large cup of coffee (Bodum's idea of a ""cup"" is only 4 ounces). But the coffee is absolutely delicious! And cleanup is a snap."
4,Best Bodum Yet,"This is a beautifully made coffee pot that is easy to clean. It keeps the coffee hot for a fair amount of time. My only complaint is that the lid is not ""thermal"" and it could keep coffee warmer longer. I have owned many presses and I've gotten tired of replacing the glass carafe. I would reccommend this pot for other butter fingers out there, too."
4,Bodium Stainless Steel 3-cup Coffee Press,"It took several tries to come up with the right combination of number of beans, how long to heat water in microwave,and how long to brew the beans to come with the perfect cup of coffee.I use 1 1/2 teaspoons of coffee.. heat the water for 3 1/2 minutes in microwave then let it brew for 4 minutes..PERFECT.Only gripe... I use a good size coffee cup.. and have to fill the press to the top to get ""1 full cup""...In no way will this make 3 cups. All the bitterness is taken out I never experienced such wonderful tasting coffee."
3,"Not so hot, coming from a drip coffeemaker","I bought this coffee press based on the many glowing reviews here at Amazon. It makes good coffee, but it should. A French press is a simple device. It's pretty. But it's a poor thermal carafe and my coffee's tepid after only an hour and a bit. I think may reviewers come to this product from single-wall presses and they're grateful for an increase temperature retention. I come from a drip coffee maker with a carafe warmer, so I'm not pleased with quickly cooling coffee.Other drawbacks to a stainless press compared to a drip coffee maker are opaque walls so you can't see how much coffee is left; and the need to measure out your dosage since you can't see a poured amount as you can when filling a filter basket. The need for a separate hot water solution is something I anticipated. Yes, I'm getting better coffee via the press compared to drip, I just wish it would stay hot longer."
4,"Nice looking, nice brewing","Well, we are fortunate that ours has had no problems after one full year (and just 2 cleanings). Looks really nice, brews very quietly, and with only a minimum of steam and no sputtering. Keeps the coffee very warm though it only stays on 2 hours. It's pretty no frills, just efficient and stylish, but for the price we are very happy."
1,"Great machine, when it works.","I bought one of these from Target about 8 months ago. I took it home and was really happy with it for about a week. It makes great coffee and keeps it hot longer. After a few days though, it quit brewing a whole pot. It would stop about halfway or less through the brewing cycle. It took it back and got a new one. It lasted about 8 months and started doing the same thing. I think there's some sort of design defect. Too bad, its a great machine, when it works."
4,Very simple story,"Simply written and illustrated, good for the younger crowd, especially when you need them to calm down."
5,Three Little Animals,"I also remember this book from when I was very little, and have been looking for it for years. I found Little Fir Family, which was also another Margaret Wise Brown memory, and remembering the two together, I finally found this one. The wind blowing everyone's clothes, and then the family finding each other again also affected me as a really intriguing and heart warming story. Don't know why this one has been so hard to find. It has not been republished as far as I know."
1,Junk not worth the metal and plastic made of,"I own 2 of these grip style clamps. Just used them to clamp and joint glued and biscuit joined pieces of wood. Clamped one of the clamps and went to secure the second clamp and it broke. The ""grip"" portion fell out in my hand when I squeezed the clamp in place. Junk! Not recommended to anyone."
1,A Beginner's Book with a Dead End,"This is really a pretty awful novel. It begins well: bloody handprint, interesting neighborhood, pretty young mailperson who is the central character. And then it grows. Meyers introduces more characters, most of whom are vaguely defined and about whom the reader cares very little. As a matter of fact, one of the victims--also the best friend of Brette the mailcarrier/heroine--is so obnoxious and mean, her death goes unmourned by anyone, even the characters in the novel!The novel goes on....and on. The plot gets more twisted and pointless. The characters become more vague and ill-defined. And finally, in the last scene the murderer dies in the swamp much like the one the reader has been mired in throughout the novel.There are lots of beginnings but the book becomes exactly what it's title implies: a ""Dead End""."
4,I am so glad I found this Author!1,"I had purchased this book and it was just sitting in my bag waiting to be read, and waiting. It was one that sounded good, but I had other better ones to read. Then I read Lost, by Helen Myers! --One word KEEPER! After I read that I tore my house apart looking for the bag that had this book. I love her character development, they are very natural. If you like Erica Spindler, Kay Hooper, and wish Iris Johanson had more romance here you go. Helen Myers. I am now in search of many more of her books. The one thing I have found that always works w/the story but does not happen in real life is the convenient death factor. The people that definately die are always the ones you think to yourself, ""The protaganists life would be so much better if ______ would just die"" but I guess that is why it is fiction. Too bad life is not that neat! Don't wait, buy this one!!"
2,Definately NOT suspense....,"This book was not a supsense novel at all. Only the first couple chapters and the last were somewhat suspenseful. All the chapters in between were slow & somewhat boring. Even the ""suspenseful"" parts were boring. Nothing reached and grabbed me. Nothing felt scary or unsettling and didn't make you bite your fingernails in suspense. For the most part is was just a nice little story about a few people you didn't care much about. Not very interesting."
4,Tara Jane O'Neil's third album,"The initials 'TJO' hide Tara Jane O'Neil, one of the most prolific young female artist of the American post-rock millieu. Her third long-play solo-achievement is probably the most experimental of all three, something that we might have anticipated after hearing her previous EP 'The Joy of..."". Tara experiments with discoid beats and rhythm machines, and the result is somewhat difficult to grasp only by shallow listening. This is an album which needs your time and full involvement to understand and fall in love with."
2,Picture is wrong!!,"Picture is not of the 97-200 set. The panel bit shown is from the 204 set. The one that will arrive with the 200 set is a straight angle rather than the double curve. March 3, 2006."
5,Great Train Robbery,We recorded it on Tv but the ending always was left off!! WE were grateful to find it in full from you!!
3,Period crime drama has oodles of charm,"THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY[The First Great Train Robbery](UK - 1978)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby StereoThree Victorian thieves (Sean Connery, Donald Sutherland and Lesley-Anne Down) plot to steal gold bullion from a moving train.Enjoyable, fast-paced crime caper (loosely based on a true story), highlighted by strong performances and oodles of period charm. Despite showing a flair for light comedy, Down is relegated to wallpaper status for the most part, but Connery and Sutherland are a study in contrasts as (respectively) the cool-headed criminal mastermind and his excitable assistant, and the supporting cast includes a wealth of familiar faces from Brit theatre and TV. Aside from a couple of minor plot holes and a disgusting scene in which a terrier dog savages a number of rats (for real), this is A-class entertainment all the way. Directed by Michael Crichton."
4,Clever,"""The Great Train Robbery"" is an excellent film. Filled with a great cast, it has the added benefits of good writing (and historically accurate language), and a clever premise. Essentially this is a complex 20th Century caper plot in a 19th Century setting. Chrichton also does a good job directing. A good movie for a sophisticated viewer."
4,Great acting and Suspense,This was a fun movie that kept us on the edge of our seats. A great clasic that moves fast.
2,ok movie,couldn't possibly live up to the epic scope of the book. watch the movie but be sure to read the book.
5,Sean Connery and Donald Sutherland and their best.,One of the many DVD's I am proud to own ... never gets old. Leslie-Anne Down makes this Adventure/ comedy one of the greatest. Worth every penny.
4,On track,With great actors and a great plot this movie is a real charmer.After reading the book I was pleased to see that the movie actuallyfollows the book much better than many others I have seen. There isa bit of uneveness in the movie but it is still a great watch.
2,Not very good,Low res copy of a VHS I assume. Not full screen and homemade looking. The price was low but I actually wanted a good copy of this classic movie. Used to have a VHS myself but have lost it and now I see that it's finally on Netflix as a streaming movie.
5,A pleasant surprise,"I had no idea Sean Connery was in this movie based on a great book by Michael Crichton. This film was fun, exciting, and very enjoyable and gave me a great understanding of the times and helped me with my understanding about the steampunk genre as well. Read the book, but enjoy the movie."
4,"Excellent cast, entertaining movie.","There are really two different points of view from which to write a review, and amazon.com did not explain which I should use. So I will comment on both.First, the vendor shipped the correct product, and it arrived extremely fast. The physical product (DVD and case) were of excellent quality.Second, the motion picture was entertaining although not 100% faithful to the book, which contains much more historical context than would fit in a feature length film. Since the author of the book also wrote the screenplay and produced the movie, I can overlook that departure. It is based on a true story, which enhances the believability of the plot. The cast was excellent with Connery, Sutherland and Down, the acting was convincing, and overall the movie was entertaining. This is not a movie for the ages, but it is better than most. If somehow you missed it when it first came out, it is well worth the few bucks it costs to see the DVD."
2,Good book...bad movie,I LOVED the book and made the mistake of buying the movie without watching it first. This movie is boring and did no justice to the book.
2,Train Wreck,"You would think that a film with a top-notch cast, sumptuous visuals, and thrilling action would be a joy to behold. You would think. No pun intended, where did this film go off-track?For starters if you're going to make a heist picture you should at least make the participants likable. We're really in Sean Connery's camp after he murders one of his henchmen. The only apparent reason that Connery is given a hero's cheer at the film's conclusion is because the script dictates it to. The heist is thrilling, but so what if the perpetrators leave you cold."
3,not perfect,"I bought this to use an older model receiver with current Blu-ray technology,it works well for some components but not at all for others .it still is useful to me and at the price I paid it was a bargain but I would pay more if it worked with all my hdmi components rather than only a few .it does convert the component video to hdmi fine but if you want to use the other two hdmi inputs it may or may not work for you"
4,A humerous page turner.,I remember having this book read to me when I was in 4th grade. I recently bought a used copy to read to my 7 year old daughter. The book deals with the boyish pranks of a 5th grader so I wasn't sure how she would react. It is now her favorite book. Some of the chapters can be a bit long for some younger readers and but the stories are humerous without being silly. There's enough meat on the bones of this book to even keep adults interested.
5,Book is as good as brand new!! Fast shipping!!,"I purchased this used book from the seller and it is in excellent condition. There are no marks, bents, spills or anything else wrong with it. Im very thrilled about the book and I will purchase again from this seller.Also the shipping was extremely fast! Two thumbs up!"
1,Not the best of BTB,"What happened to the ""Substance"" the author showed in her previous Harte sagas. This book falls flat on its face. The author spends most of the story explaining and re-explaining the Family relationships between the characters and describing their wardrobe. She fails to develope any story line of substance and her wonderful villian Jonathan is a wash out. Obviously this is not the last of the books if you read the last chapter(will not divulge its contents) But unless the next book is better than this one - don't buy it -its not worth it."
2,Where was the plot?,"This was by far my least favorite of Barbara Taylor Bradford's books. Maybe it would have been less torturous as a paperback, so I could have skipped pages of meaningless repetition, but as an Audio Cd it was excruciatingly lacking in excitement or plot. The positive side of that is that usually I have difficulty leaving the car and audio Cd when I get to work when I'm at a great spot in the story, but since there were no good spots, it was very easy to walk away from. I give it two stars only because it continued the saga and therefore is of some interest to people hooked on the series, otherwise, it wouldn't be worth one."
2,Only so-so,"I loved A Woman of Substance, but reading this book, I felt like the author was phoning it in. No real plot development -- the bad guy is mean and sinister, does nothing that affects anybody, and then apparently dies. Big deal. And the characters lacked dimension -- the good guys were lovely and honorable and admirable, and the bad guys were laughably sinister and evil, like cartoon characters. Read BTB's earlier stuff and don't waste your time with this one."
2,Just Fair,"I have read all the books and even just re-read 'A Woman of Substance' before reading this 'last' one. and, I love the first and second books! I found this one so weak and confusing that it has taken some effort to finish it. Now, for devotees, it's a must, but it needs more strengthening and better editing. Perhaps 'nit-picking' but 'antibiotics do not cure viral bronchitis'. That's a fact.The five pages of genealogy would be better served with a chart instead of text; like the English monarchs. I kept having to re-check who was whom and that was annoying."
2,Time to Stop,"Have been a big fan of the BTB saga of Emma Hart. The early ones were great--worth repeat reads. With this one, I'd say the saga should end. Hard to finish reading this book."
2,"Book ""Just Rewards"" by Barbara Taylor Bradford","Well, not much to review... Book was lost somewhere during the shipping and ""Kryston"" still did not refund my money. They promised to do so last month......This was my first time to order from Kryston, but it is obvious I will not use them again.Still waiting,Hilda Stadnik"
4,Don't Stop Now!,"I am truly a dyed in the wool Barbara Taylor Bradford fan. I have enjoyed tremendously Emma Harte and the years that evolved with the Hartes, the O'Neils, and the Kalinsky clan. I felt a sadness at the end of Just Rewards as it was the end to a few of Emma's children and knowing the age of them all, that this saga couldn't go much further. However, it could.....Barbara, give us more! You are truly a magical storyteller. I have never been to England physically but over the years, Barbara has done a fantastic job taking me there through the family of Emma Harte."
3,Typical,Writers who produce numerous books seem to have the same story line in all their books. Need new twists.
1,"Royal Albert Rose Cameo Collectible Teacup, Green","This teacup has a beautiful design, but I was very disappointed when I received it. The cup and saucer were much thicker than I would have expected for a china teacup! It also had a problem with the scalloped design for the foot of the cup as this caused the cup to rock as it sat on the saucer. I sent it back as I could not imagine trying to drink tea from this cup!"
5,Perfect,"I am always nervous when ordering something like this online. I worry that it won't be as pictured. This cup is just as beautiful as shown. I was more than pleased when it arrived, and proud to give it as a gift.The company also did a nice job shipping it. Not only did arrive quickly, they packed it so that there was almost no way it would break in the process."
5,Breathtakingly beautiful!,"If you love fine china and you are a Teacup collector, this set is worth the investment of $20. It's beautiful! The pictures just DO NOT do it justice! I will definitely be back to purchase other sets from Royal Albert."
3,Reception Issues...,"I have to second Christopher's reception issues. I am having the same problems with mine. I have also addressed the comment to the previous review regarding the blue wire and I have connected it to a power source and I still have reception that is much poorer than factory reception.I rate this 3 stars because its a possibility that my installtion is the cause of the error, but I am confident that this is installed as it should be."
1,Antenna Review,"I have read a lot online about this project and people were constantly getting low or no reception on their civic. The majority of people said this is unavoidable.This was the same case for me. I even soldered the blue wire to the blue amp control wire, and the signal was mediocre at best. From what I have read over 60% of people are running into the same issue so I don't know why this issue hasn't been addressed.I am very upset about this, and feel the manufacturer should address this"
2,Does not seem to do much...,"I have a 2010 Accord and the stock radio pulled in all stations within the Tri-state area even to the north of New Haven. I am not sure if it is the radio, the antenna or if the stock radio sent a signal to increase power or what, but this seems to be the weak link. I have to get at least into Norwalk, CT in order to pick up a Hot 97 when I was able to pick it up with the stock past New Haven! 770 WABC and AM stations, I was able to listen them all the way up in MA! I get AM but with FM I have to literally be right up on the tower! I did notice that the origial connector had some metel on the inside but this piece is lacking it. Maybe this is the problem?"
5,Great music - Great Sound,"Wow. This has some good stuff on it and it is remastered to sound very up-to-date. I love Woody Guthrie's ""Ride and Old Paint""! The labor songs get a bit tedious after about 5 of them in a row, but there is enough other material on this CD to more than compensate for the propaganda! A great addition to our collection!"
5,They're Elixers,"good strings, long life...what else can I say. They shipped fast enough. Just remember Purple packs are for acoustics and blue packs are for electrics."
3,What??,"Okay. First of all, I ordered the electric guitar strings, NOT the acoustic. So why did they send me acoustic strings?! Horrible service.UPDATE:I contacted the seller about this and they sent me the correct strings free of charge, and I got to keep the acoustic set. Great service. However, I have now had the strings on for about a month, and the nanoweb coating is now flaking off, damaging the tone of the guitar. So if I were you, I would forget about this nanoweb coating, and go for the d'addario exp strings. Much better, or you could also get the stainless steel flatwound strings, which are great for playing blues."
2,They sent the wrong size,"I ordered strings with .009 being the least string diameter. They sent strings with .011 smallest diameter. It was not what I orderd. I have electric, acoustic, and bass guitars and would have been happy to order online as the prices were good. However, I will not order online again. Sending packages back is a hassle."
5,Excellent Guitar Strings,"It's not the guitar that makes the sound, it's the string. The string is what is vibrating and the instruments just resonates. So what I am saying is that it is worth buying good strings. Elixir Nanoweb strings are supposed to last longer due to a waterproof coating. But the main this is that the sound quality is excellent. Any guitar pro will tell you, these are great strings."
5,class A product,"everything one wants in strings- crisp sound, tone gets warmer after two months, after these strings are on you really only need to change strings once to twice a year- a huge savings"
5,I love this film!,"It's a clever romantic-comedy about two people who marry eachother for reasons other than love. Then soon their reasons bring them together and they really fall in love. This film isn't your typical romantic cheese-ball. The film's direction done by Peter Weir (The Truman Show), is just great. It also has great performances from Gerard Deaprdieu (1492: Conquest Of Paradise) and Andy Macdowell (Groundhog Day), they both play the couple in the film. I highly recommend this film to couples or singles, because both groups can relate with the material. You'll most likely enjoy the charm of this film like myself and other viewers."
4,entertaining,"I enjoyed the film. The story is nothing to write home about but it's clever enough. The cast is what makes it. Many folks here pan Andie MacDowell and I admit that I got the film inspite of her. But she was surprising good. I thought she and Depardieu had great chemistry and their odd-coupling was just absurd enough to work.I loved her apartment and that wonderful greenhouse! The other shots of New York are fun to see, particularly their hike across Central Park.All in all I thought the film held together well and it makes an entertaining two hours. (hated D's hair style though; he looked like Javier Bardem in No Country for old Men!)"
5,Bravo Gerard!!,"Gerard is fabulous in this one. It's a heart warming picture about two characters with very different personalities, forced together in human circumstance. Five stars!!"
1,Dreadful American remake,"This is a very poor remake of a Canadian film called ""Les Noces de Papiers"". If you can get hold of the original, you will not regret it."
1,"This is, in reality a O.K. film","But as an actress Andie Mcdowell blows. This is all Gerard D.. Surely the producers could have come up with a better actress couldn't they? Her wooden acting subtracts 3 stars form this movie immediately, and proves why models should stick to modeling and stay away frokm acting."
4,Lovable Movie,Lovable movie and Gerard Depardieu is at his best. Loved the whole idea behind the movie
1,dont they know theres already a band called the paper chase,horrid album...thats really all to be said. dont they know they are about three years shy of claiming that name?
4,Good Informational Book,"If you are a rank amateur and just want to get some really interesting facts and information based on 'model' fires that occurred in real life, this book is a great book to start with.I purchased the book with an interest in just enough details to allow me to 'talk the language' in a book I am writing where an arson investigator is one of the characters.I think you'll find this book as fascinating as I did."
1,GAH!!!!,"If any of you value your sanity or life, stay AWAY!! I got this for Christmas. I was happy because my friend had one and it worked fine for him. Lucky for him, not for me. It didn't work with the drivers that came with it. I had to download the driver from Belkin's site to get it to even recognize that there was a keyboard there. Now, whenever I press a button once, it fills the entire screen with that key. WITH ONLY ONE PRESS. I figured that I might be missing something so I contacted their technical support. A week later I got an email saying I should just download the drivers from the site and not use the one that came with it. They won't take it back or anything, if I ever meet the president of Belkin......."
5,wonderful story,unexpected twists in the story. Makes me want to read the book.Acting was engaging and the little girl was superb! Reindeer wasnt bad either
1,The DVD did not play,The DVD was not compatible with any of my DVD players. This is very disappointing to me because I have been looking for this movie for years and just recently remembered the name.
1,This movie would not play in any DVD player that we have,"I love the movie, but could not get it to play. We tried it in three different players. Was really disappointed."
4,Very nice Christmas story,My wife and I saw this years ago. We got it to watch with our grandson. Easily qualifies as one of the Christmas movies that is worth watching every once in a while to get you in the mood for the season.
5,Great movie for children and adults alike,"I have been showing this to my children, now my grandchildren every Christmas. I enjoy watching it after all this time. Very warm and touching movie and it's great. Hollywood should do move like this and leave the sex and the vulgarity somewhere else."
4,Prancer,This was a good movie with a good story line. Didn't really feel Sam Elliott's character was portrayed the best that it could have been.
5,Great family movie,"I just love this movie, they don't make them like this anymore, good for kids and adults."
5,Christmas Movie Collection,I purchased this movie to add to my personal movie Christmas movie collection. I want my 4 year old grandson to be able to see the classics as her grows up. This is an excellent movie and a must see for anyone who believes!
5,I Met BOO-Prancer is real!,"Up in Randolph, NY, I met the REAL Star of ""Prancer"", BOO! He is one of several reindeer kept by a Nice man who dresses as Santa Claus and also goes with a Sleigh to libraries, schools, and nursing homes. What a Thrill to meet a real, live Movie Star like Prancer(BOO), and find out there is also a real nice man who owns him, and other reindeer. Also, another reindeer, Dancer, starred in a movie ""A Christmas Secret"" and you might like it as much as I liked ""Prancer"". 5 out of 5 Stars!"
5,Magical and Touching!,"A Modern Classic! This film gets better every year I watch it. Sam Elliot is great for this role and plays it perfectly. The charming little girl who plays the starring role is perfect. She's a nice change from the ""picture perfect"" little angels Hollywood normally reserves for childrens films. She's beautifully normal looking and is a wonderful little actor. A precious film to be watched each Xmas season."
3,Kids weren't into it,"We were trying to find some non-animated Christmas movies for the kids this year. My husband vaguely remembered this one from his childhood so we gave it a try. It's not a bad movie but our kids were not into it at all. We actually turned it off - which we've never done with a movie before. Our kids are 7, 4 + 2, so they are a little young for this movie. We might try the movie again in a few years. I would recommend this more for 9 + 10 year olds."
3,Prancer,The quality of the Dvd is not the greatest. pauses in several spots.I am disappointed and will probably not order videos from Amazon again.
2,"Not a bad children's movie, but adults may be bored","When 8-year old Jessie (Rebecca Harrell) rescues a stray reindeer whom she firmly believes is Santa's Prancer, she tries to keep it a secret from her disapproving father (Sam Elliott). She hides Prancer in a tool shed and does chores around the neighborhood to pay for his feed (Prancer is animatronic, so I doubt he eats much). Jessie decides to write to Santa Claus about their predicament and gives her letter to a shopping mall Santa, instructing him to deliver it to the real St. Nick. But you can't trust those phony-bearded department store Santas - the guy gives her correspondence to the town paper, who publishes it. The secret is out, and Dad is mad. Unoriginal film, but cute and harmless enough.Staci Layne Wilson"
3,a little intense for smaller kids,"I bought this for my 4 and 7 year olds. Sam Elliot's character is pretty mean (in the kid's eyes) and I feel, too intense for smaller children to enjoy."
5,"Wonderful movie, mint condition",The dvd arrived earlier than anticipated and in perfect quality. I am extremely pleased with the entire purchase. Thanks! This is an all round great movie for the entire family and is well worth the buy.
5,Great Movie,If you have not seen this yet you need to purchase. Very cute movie and the children will love it as well.
5,Amazing!,"I loved this CD! It came out fefore Any Given Sunday, and I think it is the best of all his CD's. My favorite songs are Love Soon and Victoria! It's an emotional CD that opens the heart and the mind to anyone listening."
2,shouldn't have been released,"While I loved the studio version of these songs in Room for Squares and listen to the them all the time, I have to say that this album is painful to listen to. John's voice and guitar are both out of tune and he drags terribly in several songs. This doesn't sound like a raw and more intimate version, as some have claimed here, it sounds like a poorly performed and recorded version. It makes us long for the studio engineer to speed things up and correct those off-pitch notes. Sorry, but that is my opinion. Some people, like, say, Eva Cassidy, sound great live, and some people don't. John may sound great live, I don't know, but he doesn't sound good in this recording. Problem is, this album makes me think he is probably not good live, which is why I think he would be better off living on his rep from the studio version, or re-taping some newer live versions of these songs. He really is a good songwriter, and these old performances hurt him."
5,Love!,"Everything about this purchase was amazing. I received it before the expected date, the sender was very kind, and the product was in great condition. I will definitely make more purchases. :)"
4,"Different, but good!","This type of music is new to me, but i was intrigued with his style and sound. I found it easy to play and leave on while cleaning house, then i transported it to my car, now my Grandson listens to John Mayer. I have since purchased all John Mayer's cds.There is something for everyone!"
5,The best!,"Hello ppl, this man is the best. he is unknow for the majoraty of portugueses, but one day he will blow up and then everbody will know the real meaning of MUSIC, people buy this album is the better of the past 5 years!"
5,Best of the best,"Out of all the John Mayer works I have, this is, in my opinion, his best studio work. He was not TOO big then, and was very honest and genuine. His newer works are much more commercial. This is a fantastic cd to listen to. This guy will likely turn out to be one of the great musical talents of all time, as a writer, ranking with Phil Collins, Elton John, and the like. But more than that, he is a true performer with a strong Jimi Hendrix influence. Don't believe me? Rent or buy his live DVD, 'Where the Light Is'. That performance should impress even the most discriminating critic, and is proof of why he will stand the test of time.John, if you are reading this, please lay off the chick friendly love-pop tunes. You are so much better than that. I would love to hear more of the 'John Mayer Trio'."
1,my heartfelt review of this musical genius,"like dave matthews with down syndrome, young popular musical virtuoso phenomena whatever this guy's name is has become the top hitmaker for college date rapes. his sultry, definitely not dave mathews esque voice drones on, spewing forth his incredibly original lyrics like a naty-ice and pizza fueled vomit session. when i listen to him, i feel like he really understands me and my collegiate life. god bless you, dave mathews-like guy. you are awesome man."
1,Why does he hold a guitar on his album covers?,There is guitar (horrible at that) in like two songs the rets is like listening to Backstreet Boys.
5,better than room for squares,"This album contains John Mayer almost at his best (his best being live performances). This shows his raw talent, what he can really do with out the studio production quality. I have a copy of Room For Squares, and I think this album really showcases his talent. He is an amazing vocalists and a wonderful guitar player. I really like how this album sounds. It has this raw un-kemped sound you don't hear on his studio album. I wish the songs on his studio album sounded like these. I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys the sounds of John Mayer. Not only do I recommend John Mayer, but also artits such as Josh Kelley (who is also a wonderful vocalists), Maroon 5, Jason Mraz, and Jack Johnson."
5,Beautiful first CD by John Mayer.,"'Inside Wants Out' is a wonderful look at early John Mayer. I like the stripped down acoustic sound of John. The songs, most of which are revisted on 'Room for Squares', are well written and introspective. He had already found his writing style. I highly recommend this CD."
