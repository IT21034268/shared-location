1,"it became too ""old""",For me it sounds like bad Mercyful Fate. If u really like good prog check out latest works of Fates. Pleasant Shade is much much more creative and inreresting than this.
5,"GOLDEN ""ARCH""ES",ARCH/MATHEOS AND COMPANY CREATED AN EPIC PROG CLASSIC HERE. THIS IS CREATIVE AND I'M SURE I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE ARCH'S PHRASING-VERY UNIQUE. GUARDIAN MIGHT BE THE BEST SONG EVER CREATED. A MUST FOR EVERY SERIOUS MUSIC COLLECTION.
3,Plegaria: Muy de acuerdo a la nueva visión de Pablo.,Plegaria no se parece en nada a las grabaciones anteriores de Pablo. No refleja el carácter panfletario de sus albumes anteriores pero si presenta una colección de canciones suaves e intimistas.Plegaria no es para aquellos que esperan escuchar a Pablo enarbolando la bandera revolucionaria. Plegaria es más para aquellos que esperan escuchar a un hombre común y corriente hablando de sus temores y sus vivencias.
4,Good Stuff,This book shows once again the type of emotions that Haki R. Madhubuti can evoke. His writing is raw and spiritual and blunt.
1,Historical paper restorer,"The can of Wei to I was sentwas either defective or it frozein dlvry - or, something - causeapplication caused "" frosting""of several documents that hasbeen difficult or impossible toremove."
3,"Too clever, or not clever enough?","It wasn't until I read the reviews here about ""Not the End of the World"" that I ""got"" what Kate Atkinson was trying to do. I went back and re-read the book with an eye toward the myths and the wrapping together of several characters across different stories. To be honest, even the second time around I was not that impressed with the stories. Yes, Kate Atkinson has a unique voice, one I loved in ""Behind the Scenes at the Museum"". Here, though, I felt like there was an inside conceit that was inaccessible to the reader. It's been a while since I took Latin, so it would've been nice to have the quotes translated. Atkinson teases us with characters that I would've liked to have seen more developed. It was difficult to muster up sympathy for the characters. Overall, if you are a fan of Atkinson's writing I'd say buy this. If you are approaching Atkinson for the first time, you are better starting with ""Behind the Scenes at the Museum."""
3,Not K.A. at the top of her game,"Although some of these short stories were sufficient to hold the reader's attention, they were disappointing compared with Atkinson's recent novels featuring Jackson Brodie and Detective inspector Louise Monroe."
3,Blah,I love Kate Atkinson but I just could not get into these short stories. Some were better than others but none were riveting.
2,far out,"Since discoveing Kate, she has become one of my favorite authors. This was the fourth book of hers I have read and I believe she is a very gifted writer. Her stories have always been very good and well written. But this book must have been done in her earlier years. I don't know much of her life, but she must have been tripping out on drugs. Her ability with word is something to be admired, but the subjects and storyline blew my mind. I would advise skipping this book, but I will await another."
4,Another fan,"Am currently reading everything she has written and will preorder anything she writes in the future. These are short stories and not my favorite thing to read, but hey, it's Atkinson and she doesn't do less than 4 stars."
2,Not the End of the World...,"These short stories were not really enjoyable to me. I found the humour bland, the characters shapeless, the plot in the stories ordinary (to put it mildly...) Short stories by Nadine Gordimer or Raymond Carver are in my view far superior. So it's really not the end of the world, there are many other books to read!"
5,Lovemaster,The DVD was everything and more than expected...I will be purchasing more!Makes me laugh and not just while he is performing.
5,"Doris Day ""The Girl Next Door"" CD",The product arrived very quickly.It was bought for a birthday gift and they loved it.I trust Amazon.com on all their products & sellers.Thank you so much...
2,not that $$,"I expected more based on other reviews. It's pretty light fodder for a softcore movie. Not a ""pink"" flick so I don't see any real value in it. One mildly redeeming solo shower scene w/ Beverly Lynne but otherwise I wouldn't spend $ on it. It's a cable movie at best."
1,1999.99 too good to be true?,"Well, I wrote a review of this T.V. and gave it 4 stars, but this morning, after having the T.V. for about a month, the tube is already out. I will call Apex on Monday and give another rating based on their service. I also have an Apex Progressive scan DVD player and it broke today also (its only 6 months old) --- Not a good sign, if service takes care of it timely I will give good words, if not, more bad reviews to follow."
2,calling all disatified people,"This tv worked great when it worked. When it broke, that is when the fun began. So now I am taking action. If you have this tv and are not happy, please e-mail me at tazzie3979@hotmail.com and let me know. I am tired of being screwed over by Apex and I am going to get this product recalled. This is ridiculous that we should have to put up with this. Also I am filing a complain with the better business bureau. Please contact me to get Apex to pay up."
1,Not great...,"I bought this tv because it was cheap and i was told it would get rid of black bars well on some movies it did, some it made them smaller but still there and others it put the black bars on the side! someone please make them go away! ugh!"
3,"Yes, but...","isn't an HDTV combined with a progressive scan DVD player an incredible visual masterpiece? I can't worry about 6 or 16 years in the future...the next minute isn't guaranteed... so I bought my HDTV with progressive scan DVD in mind and watching movies on anything less will never be the same again. Texture, Detail, Color Accuracy... it's like being ""one with the picture"".P.S. I do agree that the pre-order nonsense must stop, and isn't APEX the company that built a 27"" Flat Screen WITHOUT component inputs???"
1,Stay away from Apex unless you want to lose your money,"I bought a 50"" Apex projection television from Amazon and it died 3 months after I got it. Even though the television supposedly came with a ""One year in-home warranty"" it took me nearly 2 years and almost filing a lawsuit just to get them to refund me my cost of the TV, and they didnt cover the $125 shipping cost.BUYER BEWARE - It is NOT worth the hassle, spend $100 or $200 more and get a brand you can trust."
1,Run don't walk away from Apex.,I bought an Apex 3 yrs ago. Sadly it pooped out right at Christmas. There are very few people who can service these TV's. I paid 700 bucks for it. The repairman charged me 160.00 to come out to tell me that it would need a new motherboard at the cost of 400.00 + labor to repair it. That was the bad news. The good news was there were no parts to be found. He recommended that I look at Sony or Samsung. Both have good quality and cheap and easy parts to repair them with. I went with the Samsung DLP and I also bought a warranty to go with it. To you recent purchasers of Apex I would buy a warranty plan or just return it.
5,memories of the fantome,"Having once spent a wonderful week on the Fantome out of the port of Grenada with my precious Nancy (now passed on,sadly for me) I was very much interested in reading the fate of that wonderful ship. I found the book very interesting as it covered much of the background of the ""Barefoot Cruise Line"" and a very detailed account of the tragedy and the efforts to save the ship. There is a lot of interesting details about the whole background of the ship, the cruise line, and lastly the wreck of the Fantome. I will no doubt read the book again and again. (you can do that at my age, after a few weeks it's like reading a new book. you older folks know what I mean.)I would highly recomend this book to anyone that has sailed on the Fantome. It brings back a lot of bitter-sweet memories."
3,"OK, but a little cheesy","I'm sorry to say I thought that this smacked of [not do good] journalism, of pumping up the drama by turning up the volume on it instead of simply letting the story speak for itself. The Fantome's story has plenty of power in it without the artificial assist of over-invested weight and phoney spirituality. On the other hand, the simple factual description of the aftermath of the storm on the islands was moving and well told."
5,"A real ""The Perfect Storm""","Outstanding book about hurricanes, the cruise ship industry, hurricane hunters, and Central America. Not some sappy story that was ""The Perfect Storm"". You know how it ends but the story keeps you on edge."
1,Christmas Stories,"This printing by General Books is unreadable. Apparently it's scanned from another printing without any proofreading. There are random symbols, missing words, misspelled words and large missing parts of the stories that were supposed to be in this book."
1,Look out! Kindle version a completely different collection!,"This isn't a review, just a heads up; the book and Kindle editions are completely different.The book version contains 8 stories and the Kindle version contains 21 totally different stories.Amazon, can you fix this?"
2,Edelbrock IAS Shocks,"I purchased the front(33216) and rear(34216) sets for my 99 Ford F250 Super Duty. I have to admit to myself that I've had better at less of a price. The rear shocks seem to be ok. The front I'm not sure how to describe. The spring back is good for the big bumps, but they don't perform well for your average drive. I'm kind of regret buying and I am a bit disappointed. I would have thought better from Edelbrock."
2,Two third noisy,"This is not a solo guitar album as I was misled into acquiring by a careless CD storekeeper. The first three songs are nice and easy. It turns wild in the fourth one and many of those that come afterwards are mediocre arrangements of popular pieces. Though Williams has other very good stuff, I can't give it a pass for that one. So, two stars and don't fancy it if, like me, you want guitar music to help you relax and recollect."
1,Do not order,"Do Not order from Fansedge! The shipping stated at checkout is incorrect. When purchasing the Fedex option, Fansedge changes it to a smartpost package without your knowledge. I have had a horrible experience. I am military spouse who tried to get an item for my husband and was left with everyone from the customer service to mail office telling me ""there is nothing we can do"" Therefore, fansedge is not where I would recommend buying from on Amazon I have never had such a horrible experience with in all the years I have bought from Amazon."
4,Trouble the Skull and bonus DVD,The CD is great quality compared to the orignal recording but the DVD is very poor quilty. They should have left it out. Not Happy with the DVD at all.
4,Finally,"I have been waiting for Trouble's collection to become more available. Time to replace those old cassettes. DVD has a full concert, very niiiice!"
4,Trouble will always have a place in my player,"The long out-of-print album gets an upgrade with an audio remastering as well as a bonus live performance DVD. With just seven dark, evil, and indulgent tracks, the Chicago metallers set out to establish themselves as the Black Sabbath of the eighties. Although never as popular, Trouble will always have a place in my player when I want to hear that classic 80s metal sound. The DVD gives you a glimpse of the metal scene at the time and racks up the song tally to sixteen."
1,Horrible DVD,"Dont buy this for the DVD ,it is a horrible bootleg that is unwatchable.I cant believe this is the best footage they had.Buy the live in Stockholm DVD,dont waste your money on this..."
1,ace ventura the case of the serial shaver,"I thought I was getting an animated cartoon like ""Reindeer Hunter"" which is fantastic and funny. This is a piece of GARBAGE with computer graphics that look totally insane. You are not getting the cartoon, but some silly looking computer graphic junk! Waste of time..."
5,AMAZINGLY CATCHY SONGS,LET ME START BY SAYING THAT GOLDFINGER ARE ONE OF THE BEST LIVE PUNK BANDS YOU CAN SEE. THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD SONGS ON THIS CD. THEY HAVE LESS OF A SKA SOUND IN THIS CD FROM THEIR LAST ONES BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THIS CD ROCKS! I CAN'T WAIT TILL THESE GUYS COME AROUND AGAIN BECAUSE THEY ARE SO ENERGETIC ON STAGE. THEY ALSO HAVE LYRICS THAT INSPIRE AND MAKE YOU WANT TO SING OUT LOUD. JANUARY IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. TODDSTER.
5,"Excellent, Excellent","I got this CD a little over a week ago, and I must say its the only CD I've listened to. I read that a lot of hard-core Goldfinger fans don't like the album, which is fine. I used to only like a few songs from Goldfinger, whereas most of their stuff just seemed like poorly-written abrasive punk. However, when I got this CD, I was pleasantly suprised, and I absolutely love it. Sure, it's more poppy, but if you can get over the fact that Goldfinger has actually gotten better at song-writing rather than label them as pop-punk, then you'll enjoy this record. It's catchy and overall just plain rocks. Like others have said, if you like Blink 182, Green Day, or any other mainstream punk band, check out this CD. Top tracks? Probably Radio, Happy, and Going Home, in that order."
1,A disgusting display of veganism rhetoric!!,"This band is disgusting to its evil core!!!! The title track open youre eyes is the most forceful,threatening,display of vegan lies and mis-information!!! With the song lyrics going IF YOU DONT LOOK , ILL FORCE YOU TO being spewed forth by the bands raging,incoherent,mad-man,front-man!!!!! Also they support peta. And that aint good! NOT AT ALL!!!!!"
2,what happened?,What is this? Just as it seemed like Goldfinger was getting better and better (and more original) with each album they put out an album that sounds like so many other watered down punk bands. Why do the vocals sound like blink 182 all of a sudden?
5,Very Good,"Another solid set by the best Punk/Ska band ever. ""Stomping Ground"" was a bit of a let down, but ""Open Your Eyes"" makes up for it. A good, clean recording sound, and excellent songwriting, combined with great musicianship makes this a great buy! So for everyone that thinks their a punk because hey listen to Blink-182, try this CD on for size."
3,What happened?,"To me, goldfinger was a high energy surf punk band. This album didn't seem to coincide with their other styles lyric-wise. They've joined the ranks of bands like propaghandi and Good Riddance with thier political connotations and hate filled lyrics. Kudos for procaliming what you believe, but it just didn't seem to fit with goldfinger. They didn't ever seem ""angry"" in their other albums, shows or videos.Very dissapointed in this album, but, as always, fantastic riffs, melodies and overall song writing ability. I'll probably end up cutting the garbage out and making it into a mini-album."
4,"They Say, write, and sing what they want","This is a good album, not the best goldfinger but good. Their songs are in your face, if you don't like what he is saying don't buy their record, their having fun, like most musicians should be doing. I'm not vegan but am vegitarian. If you don't like this album, and you don't care about being animal free, SHUT UP and tell someone who does. If you don't like it, don't listen. Their breaking the mold of todays bands, playing what they want and making some money. Some people need to lighten up and see that their is some realy good un-mainstream music and not all people eat meat and like pop. They sing about what they like, just like you talk about what you like. So if you like meat and like pop music, backstreet boys will love to get your money."
2,"Music is okay, message is too preachy","Goldfinger took a risk and made an album exclusively for vegetarians. It was difficult/impossible for me to enjoy this CD because it was so anti-meat. How can you enjoy a song when it's basically criticizing you? While a lot of them felt like previous poppy, sing-along Goldfinger songs, it made the critical lyrics stick out that much more. Example from the title track: ""A shot to the head, so you can be fed. Won't you wake up wake up. Whoahhhhh. Open your Eyes."" I love the vocals and music on this, but how do you sing along and not feel like a hypocrite? I don't blame them for making the album. More power to anyone who sings about something they feel, but you risk alienating some listeners, especially with the crap in the liner notes. It certainly doesn't help that this album was worse musically than their previous albums. The song ""Dad"" is so unbelievably bad. Put it this way, this was the only Goldfinger CD I've traded away."
3,"Good, but by no means great","Don't get me wrong, it has some good, catchy songs, but this is not the Goldfinger iv'e come to love. Some tracks, Spokesman for example, are great. There is too much anger though. The lyrics have become too political. Im all for singing about what you stand for, but I think they went overboard.Overall, if you are a new listener, go for something else such as Hang Ups or their self titled CD. If you are a fan, get this, but dont expect anything spectacular.Sidenote: Whats with all the hate against meat eaters?"
3,Not GF's best work,"It is clear why the music style on Open Your Eyes differs, and is a bit harder, than previous Goldfinger albums. With the departure of Charlie, their former lead guitarist, so went some of the punk/ska style. Their current lead guitarist used to be in the band Unloco, which is more of a hard rock band. It's natural that with his hard rock influences that Goldfinger's music will follow suit. He brings a whole new side of creativity to the table. That being said, the album does have its moments. Woodchuck, though short and campy, exhibits that newly-found harder edge. Also, Radio helps bridge the gap between GF's new sound and old. In a sense, the songs do not feel sincere as a whole. It is as though the band wrote them in an effort to release something new and to provide new material to play live. Let's hope that the next GF album strives to provide the experience that late-90s GF albums did, even though their music style has evolved through the years."
3,"Not bad, but definatly NOT Goldfinger.","This cd was not bad. Actually I have to disagree with the people who gave this cd only 1 star. It was pretty good...to a certain degree.I love Goldfinger because they were able to be like a punk-rock band but always rose above all the ... pop-punk out there today such as Blink182, Sum41, and New Found Glory. They were able to get away with punk rock because they added ska and funk with it.""Open Your Eyes"" loses the old Goldfinger sound though. They went from the ska/punk/reggae/funk band to just punk rock. Although I did enjoy a lot of the songs on the cd, I couldn't help thinking I was listening to just another Blink182 or Sum41 band.I was able to get through those thoughts and still realize that it is Goldfinger and that they are one of the best. But I do miss the old days when they were so much better.I wouldn't exactly spend money on this cd. This is more of a cd you would download the songs from or just burn it from your friend."
1,not for my kitties :o(,"the recording device was easy to use. the ball itself seems pretty well made. however, my 4 cats did NOT like this toy. at first, the hole where the treats fall out of looks too big and i thought the treats would fall out too easy. i was wrong. because of the recording device in it the treats dont fall out easily at all. my cats are trying to get teh treats out and they wont come out! so they all pretty much gave up. i even tried to use smaller treats but they are really hard to get out. i had to pick it up and shake the ball to get one treat out. maybe my cats are too lazy but i doubt it. when it comes to food they are reallly persistant. i think the problem is that the ball doesnt roll easy because of the recorder. the recorder piece that snaps into the ball makes the weight of the ball fall onto one side making the treats harder to get out. its just one more toy to add to my cats bag that they never play with."
3,"Okay, voice recording works well and lasts long","I got this for my cat when he started to get kind of overweight. I thought he would enjoy chasing the ball and getting treats. The voice recording was simple and works well. When the ball is rolled, the recording is played. Ours has lasted almost 2 years. The only problem is my cats don't really play with it. They got tired of it and the had trouble getting the treats out. If you have a very active cat that is very curious, this would be good for them."
1,clean but unhappy,"The 2 disc special edition was clean, but it was not a comparable match with any of my devices except my computer where I could change the reading code. we tried everything from blueray. to dvd to xbox. nothing worked."
5,PURE ACTION!,"BOTTOM LINE:If you are not looking for balls-out action with sweaty, muscular men destroying mythical-like, demonic-looking bad guys...then why did you buy this movie in the first place?! :-)"
4,Good movie,"I think you have to accept certain movies for what they are. I wasn't expecting Shakespeare so I wasn't disappointed. I wanted visual excitement, it's what I got. Overall, I liked the movie and I thought the cinematography and stylistic visuals were great."
2,Not any better than reg. DVD version,"I already had a copy of this on regular DVD, but bought a Blu-Ray copy thinking it would be better. I can't even tell the difference. It's still grainy as hell. Save your money and just let your blu-ray player attempt to upconvert this movie."
3,300,I really had a hard time getting into this film and kept falling asleep. I'm sure it is a great movie I have only watched it once so I really can not comment for a good rating. The actor and previews was what had me buy it. Other people said it is a great movie so I will take there word.
4,"upgrade, but not much","I love this movie.I have the normal dvd.I bought this with the idea that it would be a substantial improvement in sound and video.It was not substantial.BUT, neither do I have a high-end TV.From what I hear, Blu-Ray upgrades tend to provide greater sound upgrade then visual.I hope this helps."
4,Very good movie,"It was received in perfect condition. It took 1 month and 4 days to reach the door of my house. I live in Santiago, Chile."
4,"great graphics, true to Miller's art","Impressive graphical storytelling, true to Frank Miller's original graphical novel work. Amazing visual effects that made this download a treat for the eyes. Compelling story. Not a surpirse to hear that many NFL teams made this movie viewing part of their 07 season opening training camps. Worth the download, as long as blood doesn't bother you."
3,Popcorn flick.,"Take a little of the silly, soft focus scenes from Gladiator, add a color palette reminiscent of Sin City, toss in a goofy actor in the lead (who yells a lot, but really can't pull it off -- he reminded me of that Monty Python skit about the guy who likes to shout), add enough blood, guts, and dismemberment to satisfy Mel Gibson, and there you have it. 300. This movie is a comic book in the stereotypical sense -- a plot line even a five year old could follow, lots of bad lines meant to sound heroic and manly, lots of sweaty male bodies in impossibly good shape, and mayhem. What makes the film rise above a two star rating is the artistry of it. Frank Miller's artistic sense shines through in some gorgeous, but often gruesome, scenes. A feast, as it were, for the eyes and limbic system. It's fun, lightweight amusement, and a good way to vicariously relieve yourself of any anger you might have against your boss, teacher, sibling, or spouse."
2,"If your neutral, buy the HDDVD for sure","I've seen this on a PS3 and an HD-A2. The clear fact of the matter is that the extras on the HDDVD version make it well worth the combo price. I have never seen extras this good before. The movie itself is great on both, but there is quite a bit of advanced extras on HDDVD that really push extras to a new level."
2,Politically Correct feminist movie,"Political Correctness strikes yet another symbol of virtue and strength. Pretty boys. Almost as pretty girls. Historical farce very loosley based on the delaying action fought at Thermopylae. The almost 70 year old Leonides is portrayed by a 30 something bodybuilder. He gets his wifes permissoin to make her decisions. This is a Hollywierd romance. Nothing more.There is some good gore in the fight choreography. Sadly, even these are poorly done. Great graphics as is expected of american films today. By the way, were rhinoceri and elephants and giants used by the Iranians(Persians) at Thermopylae? And are Iranians Negroes? I ask because they are in this film.If you're looking for a more accurate and yet entertaining account of Thermopylae and the Spartans read ""Gates of Fire"" by Steven Pressfield.Avoid this movie or save your money for renting it."
1,2nd Crappiest movie of all times.,"Great service and shipping by amazon...movie couldn't have been worse. I expected historical inaccuracy, and got it. The dialogue, on the other hand, was so suprisingly horrid that it made the movie almost unwatchable. I will give it this, it wasn't quite as bad as Battlefield Earth."
4,300,i wanted something thats looks good on blu-ray ...big n loud..this is a really good movie but is it blu-ray worthy....YES this movie looks great on blu-ray BIG n LOUD
5,the mans man movie,The story of the battle that saved democracy as 300 Spartans held off thousands or persians while Athens and Sparts evacuated in the advance of the army of Xerxes.
1,Inaccurate and childish,"I realise that the movie is based on a comic and not meant to be historically accurate, but come on... This movie is verging on the racist. IT could have been far more interesting had it tried to depict even a tiny bit of what Perisa was about. As for the action senes... a third rate copy of Lord of the Rings"
3,HDDVD extras not that great,"People are hyping up the HDDVD like its sooooo much better than blu ray, I think they are misinformed. The only difference is that on HD you get to clip together your favorite scenes and make a montage, you DO NOT get to add brand new scenes. If you don't believe me, go visit the official 300 DVD website. Also the HD version has a game to test your strategy knowledge, and the director gives you an indepth look at the adding of CGI... that's it. The blu ray still gives you the deleted scenes, actor commentary, webisodes, and a few more added features, so if that slight difference is worth 4 more extra bucks, go get HD, otherwise its the exact same thing..."
1,Pointless,This movie is just pointless violence...kinda like the war in Iraq. If you love war content with a poor plot then this is your movie. If you love death and mayhem with no purpose then join the military and jump on the next flight to Baghdad.
1,Great deception,"Beautiful images, bad movie. A haf-page script, 3 lines of dialog, sounds like an unfinished PS1 videogame intro. And the HD ? same quality as the DVD."
1,Boring,I love action and fighting movies and history. I was excited that a movie was being made about Battle of Thermopylae. I thought this movie had a chance to be great. The slow-mo and fantasy aspect to me was less thrilling than a more realistic movie.
3,"good movie, but stripped down","this one will be an hd-dvd purchace for me. blu-ray discs from warner are stripped down of features due to format limitations. no web features, no interactive commentary or menus. i mean its 4 extra bucks forthe hd-dvd because its a combo, but the combo does come in handy if u want to take it to a friends house that doesnt have an hd-dvd player. i have taken advantage of combo discs before."
1,"Lots of effects, but that's about it","300 tells you a little about Spartans and how they are selected and trained as warriors. King Leonidas takes 300 of the best warriors to fight the Persians supposedly against the wishes of the Oracle.There is no character arc and little story at all. It's war with lots of visual and sound effects of slicing, dicing, and blood splatter. There were some scenes that I found disturbingly weird like the Persian king's harem tent.If you're into movies for effects, you might like it. If you like movies for the characters and storyline, you probably won't."
1,Bad movie...,"If you want to learn about history of the 300, get a hold of the 1962 version. I watched both of these movies in the same day. There is also a very good documentary about the 300, which I saw a few months ago (Sorry forget the name of it). While I thought some parts of the 1962 version were dated and cheesy. This version which I had high hopes for was horrible. It was kind of like they took lord of the rings and merged it with a historical story, sorry best way I can describe the look, feel, music and storyline. The results were a very poor movie. The strange radioactive mutant creatures that fought the Spartans were never explained, and very un-historical. Why were they in the movie? Also, king Xerxes looked like he was a Villain from a ""Mad Max"" movie rather than a Persian King. And the story line was laughable, stupid and very lame. It looks like Very little research was done on the setting, costumes, period music and much more."
2,ehh,"over rated, homo erotic hollywood drivel, I was not impressed. really a fantasy piece that takes a shit from a high place onto history."
2,The worst pq i ever seen in blu-ray format,"I got this movie on blu-ray because i like this movie so much that i decided to buy it as soon as it will come on blu-ray but my my i am very disappointed about the pq for this film it just feels like you are watching this on pirated dvd, i am watching it on my ps3 i don't know whether upgrading my ps3 will improve it but if that has to be the case than rest of my blu-ray movie would also have look the same or may be i got the defected blu-ray title i will try to replace this for sure"
2,300 Blu Ray,"This review will not critique 300 the movie. Rather it will be a critique about the blu ray movie quality. This is not the first time I purchased a blu ray movie and was disappointed by the picture quality. For some reason, when this movie is played, there is a grain pattern throughout the whole picture. It really makes watching the movie a disappointment. I already owned 300 on DVD, so I expected the Blu ray to be a step up in picture quality. Very disappointed."
5,Simply Great,"Great story, great special effects, great actors and most of all great director. A must have."
4,Forgotten Values,"Honor, courage, belief...these are all values that today's society seems to have forgotten about. Leonidas, his men, and all of Sparta believed fiercely that certain things were worth fighting and dying for. Today, certain things are still worth fighting for...even if you know you'll lose, you sometimes just have to do the right things. Our society, especially since 9/11 and Operation: Iraqi Freedom, needs to remember that some men might have to die in order to secure our country's safety. Those of us who have been in the service, or are currently serving, understand that. Otherwise, we wouldn't be so proud to have done what other's were either unwilling or unable to do. May King Leonidas' message be remembered forever...OOH-RA!"
1,Fascinating,"In this cross between a Harlequin romance novel and Mein Kampf, desperate overactors dress up in leather thongs to shed the blood of nonwhites in slow motion - all for the sake of ""liberty"".The Spartan queen actually says ""freedom isn't free"". And then she has some apple pie. (OK, I made that last part up - but it wouldn't have been out of place).If you like homoerotic schmalz, pretentious narration and unfettered sentimentalism, this is the movie for you!"
2,truly dissapointed,i do not understand the appeal of watching video game like graphics telling the story of the spartans against the persians.. I especially do not understand this in combination with one of the cheesiest soundtracks ever written and some of the most over the top narration and dialogue.. This is a film which sets out to appeal to a young male audience and neglects the potential of its own plot elements.. It is like watching someones' barbaric fantasies without having any stable ground to stand on and it is a thourough waste of time..I think they tried to make up for the visual and audio lack of substance by trying to sell the historic points of the story.. but this only makes the movie look more off balance - like a poor rendition of gladiator..I would recommend this movie to young gamer types but i would strongly caution any true fans of cinema against this movie..
1,"Ordered wide screen, got full screen","I ordered 300 widescreen edition. I didn't realize they sent me full screen until I started to watch the movie. By then it's too late, I already opened it. I really wanted to see the movie as soon as it arrived so I probably would've opened it anyway. Sure wish I would have got what I ordered. No more online movie shopping for me, i'll go to the store so I get what I want."
1,Discs were missing from the box,I have never been disappointed with Amazon before. This was a first. I ordered the movie 300 for my son as a gift from Amazon. When we decided to watch the movie and opened the box...No discs...Nothing. I had to run to Blockbuster to buy it as there were guests at my house waiting to watch it. I had to return the empty case for a refund.The movie is GREAT!
2,The 300 Spartans and the Battle at Thermopylae,"Several years ago I boughtGates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of ThermopylaeThis book was history in a real way, and it was most enjoyable to learn about the Spartan life. And then to read of the planning for the battle, its execution and results. Wonderful!Now, out comes a DVD named '300' which is so off the mark, so Hollywood and so unbelieveable that I would not buy it again or reccomend it to anyone. The DVD does insult to the Spartans who fought the Persians and in doing so, preserved democracy."
3,Avoid Combo if using XBOX360 HD-DVD player,"Didn't work at all on XBOX360's HD-DVD player. Had to exchange it for none combo one guy at work had. None combo DVD worked fine looks great. Combo one works fine in coworkers stand alone HD-DVD player. So if you aren't using 360, purchase away. I just don't recommend if you are gonna use the 360. After researching, have heard that combo disks are hit or miss on playing on the 360. Some do some don't.--EDIT I hear MS is releasing a new update to help with this compatiblity, will check again to see if they fixed this. Great movie."
2,Oh please.....,"This has to be the dumbest movie that any film maker has ever tried on a historical battle in the anicent world, To say that it is very inaccurate in it's view of how Greek and Persian Warriors actually fought is only one of it's many flaws. My own advice to film makers and the comic writers who wrote this garbage is this, You no more know history then you can read a map."
1,I give it a star because i am required to.,"I can not give even a star to it. It is the worst movie I've seen for a long time. My daughter even did not use her chance to go to sleep laterto watch it to the end. It is slow, borring, gorry and weird. You can not even review it as an some kind of avangard production.I have no doubt that Iranians are right to be insulted by this. That is their greatest warrior pictured there as all piersed gay whore. Try to imagine france'sNapoleon in the leather outfit with the buttoks hanging out in the Waterloo epic shot by the same crew or even Hitler in the lingere from victoria secret.The script is - NONE. It is like watching the computer game and not having a chance to play it. Do not buy, do not rent, stick with Apocolipto, Pathfinder or Kingdom of Heaven. Don't waist your time.PS. I have to give it a star prompted by the system, but in fact my rating is one big fat ""0""."
1,"Terrible, racist, sexist movie",It was a terrible movie for a woman of color to watch. Why were the heroes all white anglosaxon men while all the people of color were 'evil'.
1,Buyers Beware...,This has nothing to do with the movie. The movie itself is Great!I'm not sure if this is Amazon's fault but when I receive the movie it has fingerprints on it. I originally bought this on black friday and I bought it as brand new but when I received the DVD it is clearly used and has a lot of fingerprints and scratches. Just HORRIBLE!!! NOT ACCEPTABLE!!! BUYERS BEWARE!
1,Pretentious dross,"An admission: I couldn't watch more than 10 mins or so of this, so this review is clearly an unfair one on that level. But . . . this is rubbish. Got it ""free"" with the Toshiba player, and I am sure there are thousands of copies out there for cheap. Don't waste you money. Gratuitous violence, ultra pretentious, and the most stilted acting you have ever seen. This sort of movie would be great for proponents of censorship. Not because censorship is a good idea or anything like that, but just because if this movie were to be banned the world would be - fractionally - a better place."
1,Can not get it,"So long time ago. I can not get the product,please contact me. My email is free_bryant2004@yahoo.com.hkX x x x x x x x x"
1,"Movie 5 Stars, Blu ray disc 1 star",Movie is great.wanting to watch the movie on high resolution bought this blu ray disc but in return i got grainy picture.It was very frustrating viewing this.at first i thought there was a problem in my hdtv then cable until i checked my terminater blu-ray disc.Very dissapointed.
3,Bad Audio,"Great movie, but a terrible audio mix on this version. Center channel is pushed too low, surround channels are pushed too high. If you have the system cranked it's just fine, but if you have it on casually, the dialog is nearly impossible to hear."
5,SPECTACULAR FEATURE,"This movie was simply spectacular!!! The depth and darkness of the movie makes it simply beautiful and powerful to watch. It's haunting as well as chilling, but heart-warming all the same. You almsot become one with the characters...fighting along side them. Sparta becomes your country and your home. When this movie ends you'll be blown away. This movie was just simply spectacular. I could defiantly say the best movie so far of the year!!! This is defiantly a movie to own!"
3,"Fun to watch, but not good HD DVD demo material...","I liked the special effects in this movie, but I wish the makers of the film hadn't purposely made the movie so grainy. I know they wanted to mimic the ""feel"" of the novel and everything, but the graininess makes it so you can't really use this film to show off what HD DVD can do. Don't get me wrong, the HD DVD side is much crisper, clearer, and all around better than the standard DVD side but I guess I'll have to stick to King Kong on HD DVD to show people all that HD DVD has to offer."
4,Good movie,I liked the movie and all but I'm not happy that theirs no special content on the dvd. I think that it's a b**** move on WB's part to put out another dvd version with the special content they brag about with a higher price. Hell makes me wish that I had a PS3 so I could get the blu-ray version.
5,At last Gerard Butler will get some well deserved praise!,"This movie was amazing. Pure and simple. Gerard Butler (who most know from Phantom Of The Opera) plays King Leonidas with a quite intensity that puts Russell Crowe's Maximus to shame. I hope this brings more attention to Butler now, as I am a long time admirer of his.The cast is filled with all those actors that always play supporting roles. Rodrigo Santoro, David Wenham, Michael Fassbender, Dominic West etc etc. And as with Gerard, I hope this movie brings them bigger and better movie roles.All in all, this movie is superb, visually stunning and at times heart-wrenching, I mean come on, who else felt bad for the Oracle? Hahaha"
5,Great Film!,This is a great story yet a bit graphic. Really loved this movie and a great addition for collectors.
2,I Did Not Enjoy,"There was so much hype about this movie. I simply could not get into it. I was able to follow the storyline without any problems, but it simply did not interest me. I guess... Women are from Venus and Men are from Mars."
2,Suprised,"I'm a fan of action movies, including the ones that dab into a little history, though I just couldn't get into this one. A little too monotonous (<---excuse the spelling!) for me though the cinematography was good. I hate to say it but, I'm glad I waited for this to come out on DVD rental."
4,Format Note,"I can't wait for this to come out!IMPORTANT NOTICE: This disc is a high-definition DVD and is compatible only with HD DVD players such as the Toshiba HD-A2. It will not play on a standard DVD player. For more information, see our HD DVD buying guide.It should be noted that the notice above on the top of the page is INCORRECT, as this is a Combo DVD and HD DVD so it WILL play on normal DVD players although obviously not in high definition."
4,its a movie,"Its 300. the movie rocks. I bought this because I thought my Xbox could play HD DVDs. Not sure if the old ones will but the newest slim Xbox model WILL NOT play this as an HD DVD. Not too bad since I could flip it over and play it as a regular DVD. I'm sure I could have avoided this had I done a little research on the new Xbox. Overall, 300 rocks."
2,not a combo dvd,"i bought this because it was supposed to be a combo dvd, it wasn't! Only hd-dvd.The movie is great1 Just know ahead of time what you are really buying."
3,Let down but pretty images,Wow...what a let down. It was good but not awesome like I was expecting it to be. The action scenes were very nice but other than that there was just nothing. I didn't feel connected to any of the characters because we never really get to know a single one of them. When they weren't fighting it was boring. But every frame of the movie is just beautiful. And it really made me wanna get a cape. Everybody looks cool in a cape! You'd think in battle it'd get stepped on by the guy behind you but no... it's just cool looking
5,Fun movie,"Not a real thought provoker, but movies like this definitely have their place. Very entertaining and full of fun sound bites."
3,Digital Noise,"The quality of Movie is good overall.I would not say crystal clear since there are many dark sceans in the moive which lead to digital noise or pixelated picture (lacking a better word, but i think you get the point)I have a Sony XBR2 40 inch. I think it's a quality tv and my opinion about the movie is based on that TV.Sit back and enjoy this movie.."
2,Not a masterpiece!,"This movie was nowhere close to something like The Last Samurai. The martial art was not convincing, the fact was horribly far from the truth, the plot was forceful and inapproriate... Ok, tell me how a guy who had just killed several hundred Persians could not hear a horse racing toward him! Duh?The thing that really got people seems to be the over-saturated yellow-cast high contrast color effect of the movie. Trust me, cheap effect! Many, me included, can produce. That's why I compare it to The Last Samurai, its spectacular lighting, and the use of color are unmatched!I knew the movie was based on a fiction, and I'm fine with that. But please dont take it as history. I will laugh my *** off if this movie wins any award... Oh wait, may be (cheap) effect!Btw, for those of you who cant watch the movie, try to turn off your firewall for the movie to load, when it's done you can (should) turn it back on. Hope that help!"
5,PEOPLE PLEASE IT'S A MOVIE AND BASED ON FACT.,THIS IS THE WAY MOVIES ARE GOING AND LOOK FOR MORE LIKE IT TO COME.....SO THIS FILM IS BASED ON FACT AND A COMIC BOOK...BRAD PITTS CHART. I'M SURE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE HE DID IN TROY SOOOOOOOOOOOO......BE NICE. GREAT DVD GOOD MOVIE......IT WAS A HONOR TO HAVE FOUGHT BY YOUR SIDE MY KING!!!! IT WAS A HONOR TO HAVE DIED BY YOURS......
2,Don't Believe The Hype,"This was hugely disappointing. The ""plot"" made most Falcon films seem deep. All style, no logic or character development of any kind. Save your money and buy Rome seasons 1 and 2 instead. Unless you are a 13 boy, skip it."
4,Lets talk about the movie instead of formats.,"First the format war: Blu-ray is winning. Whether this is good or bad, I'll let you decide.Now, about the movie - Neat mix of history and mythology. Visually appealing, the sepia tones lend support to the mythology aspect. Some of the characters and animals are definitely a bit on the ""hokey"" side but add to the overall tone of this flick. I say ""flick"" because this is definitely a fantasy style retelling of the battle of Marathon. Only the barest attempt to follow history is made, but there are real enough references. Overall, a very entertaining bit of escapism.One last note: Guys, I recommend you spend several weeks in a gym working on those ""six-packs"" before you let your girlfriend see this movie. You will suffer in the comparison if you don't..."
3,"Like the original ""300 Spartans"" much better","I am not a big comic book fan, but I am a lover of ancient history (Greece in particular), so I was very interested to see this film.With that being said, my impression after leaving the theater was that this film was ancient history meeting ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Kill Bill"", sponsored by Mountain Dew and Bowflex and shown Friday night at 11:30 on Cinemax.I liked the original film ""300 Spartans"" much better."
3,Not as good as expected,"After all the hype about this movie and all the good reviews I expected probably too much.The story is known and gives a lot of space for an excellent movie, but this one tries too badly to create a certain ambiente and lacks of suspense and interesting story.The special effects are very good.Bruckheimer or Ridley Scott should have made this movie.A shame!"
2,Bad Blu-Ray Quality,"Really liked the movie, but this Blu-Ray is awful. The video quality is terrible, gradients during dark scenes and grainy throughout. The audio mix is even worse, really quiet voices with extremely loud sound effects/ambient music, impossible to balance. Look for a different version/format of this one!"
1,won't play on XBOX360 HD drive,"I recently tried to play the HD DVD on my XBox360 HD drive. It started playing ok, then just stopped and returned me to the dashboard. I tried playing again, and the same thing happened. The third time I tried to play it, I used the remote to jump to a chapter past the failing point and it played for a bit, then stopped again.I have the latest updates for the XBox360. Not sure what the problem is."
1,"bad, bad, bad movie","The reviewer who wanted to know when it was over was more lucky than I. I could not fall asleep during this huge waste of time. I got this one expecting to be entertained, but I was bored almost to death. It was so bad, and so overdone that is was amusing, not entertaining. The characters were cartoonish, and a waste of creative energy. Anyway, avoid this horrid thing, please. There are many better things to do with your time, like mow the grass, wash your shoes, count the flowers on the wall, or play solitare with a deck of 51. You will be distracted by many of the special effects and brought to the threshold of a migrane. It simply fails to live up to the expectations that have surrounded the movie."
2,"Entertaining, but.........","This is an entertaining movie to a point. Yes, it's based on fact, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to say just how much. I was expecting to see a regular historical movie but was very disappointed in the fact that it had ""supernatural"" occurances and creatures. Also, I'm not deaf in the least, but I and my husband had a lot of trouble understanding some of the dialog. Would I recommend this movie...no."
5,Excellent Buy,This movie looks fantastic in HD-DVD. The special features are robust. My favorite is the PIP (picture in picture) green screen film version which is not available on Blu-ray. Here you can see the actual filming of the movie in a sub-window along with a narrative. This item is a no-brainer!
5,THIS IS....,"an awesome action movie with outstanding movie effects. If you just want a movie with the good guy and bad guy going at it for 2+ hours then this is a movie for you. Insane amount of action and a nice lil twist in the plot near the end of the movie just leaves you going, ""Wow!"" Probably not a movie for the too serious. Its not a complicated movie to follow, and its a nice kick back movie that doesn't involve you having to piece together tidbits here and there to make sure your understanding it right. Like I mentioned before, just a nice solid action movie, can't really go wrong with it if you enjoy a bit of arse kicking."
5,Spartans!!!,"Heavily dramatized; heavily laden with special effects; superbly played; absolutely true to events, especially, The Event (I was there <;-)), and, to the surprise of everyone, reminds me somewhat of The Battle of the Alamo, down there in Texas!!! But this was a mountain pass, and the only safety for the Greeks that needed time to form and consolidate their forces in preparation for what was to come, and as we well know, time waits for no one!!! The Spartans gave the rest of the Greeks the time they needed, even though King Leonidas had trouble with his own parliament (as in divided in support)!!! Still, his action (of the 300) saved the Greeks from what would have been very sure destruction!!! And there would have been no such thing as a marathon, in or out of the Olympic Games!!"
3,Great CGI,"This movie was very well done as far as the CGI and the green screening goes. but I had to give is a three star simply because of the shallow story line and the unnecessary graphic sex which didn't add anything to the story it just gave us guys another thing to watch. But like I said, the graphics are amazing and the epic war sequences are untouchable, just be ready for graphic violence and carnage throughout. I guess if I had to sum up this movie in one word, it would be ""Graphic"". Not that thats a bad thing, just be ready for it and you may want to see it before you have a family movie night with it. Hope this helps!"
3,BEAUTIFUL LOOKING WITH FANTASTIC ACTION SEQUENCES!,"My title say it all and after an extremely ""talky"" first half this film really takes off. Trimming the length about 15 minutes would have made this film much better. There was just too much(thee & thou)gibberish being spewed throughout this otherwise entertaining popcorn movie. The film does have an interesting look and the characters seemed to be leaping off the pages of a graphic novel. I just wanted more action and less B U L L #%$&*!"
2,What was all the hype about?,This was truly a mediocre movie with some beautiful visual shots in it. Really did not even come close to living up to the hype though. A true dissapointment to me.
4,300 HD,"I bought this item as a gift. I had a hard time finding the HD version in stores, so was very pleased to get it so quickly on Amazon. Great quality, quick delivery."
2,Overkill...literally,"I admit, I really didn't care for this movie. It's based on a ""graphic novel"", which I know can be a legitimate literary form (""Road to Perdition"" was excellent), but this is more like a comic book for grown-ups; all posturing, stiff dialogue (""We are SPARTANS!"" Yeah, okay, I get it), cartoony gore, and a seemingly endless running time.I guess the director was aiming for something on a mythic scale, but it...just...didn't...work for me. Still, I know this movie has its fans. No accounting for taste, I guess.Rated R for gore, not nearly enough nude women to be interesting, and generally over-the-top everything."
4,Wonderful Movie,"Okay, I am a girl. But I do always love to go with my husband and friends to see great action and drama. This movie was wonderful. The graphics and special effects were amazing. I had an open mind when I went to see the film the first time. The second time, I loved it even more. I went with husband and brother-in-law. Brother-in-law is a huge comic and graphic novel expert and absolutely loved it (also liked it more the second time around). My b-i-l says that the movie is a great rendition of the graphic novel, keeping true to much of the original feeling that the novel conveys. I would highly recommend this film to anyone - just remember that there is a lot of ""gore."" If you can get through Kill Bill and see it for its artistic beauty, then you can certainly do the same for this movie. It is a beautiful film!"
3,"good history, but bloody","Enjoyed the historical part of this movie and the actors are great. But it is too bloody for my taste. However, all wars are bloody."
2,Another misrepresentation of history?,"I really thought I would like this but sadly did not.If it was not a film about something that suppose to of happened it might of been better,say a film of fantasy?No it was still flat.No character development,I did not have any feeling toward anyone in the film.Truth turned into myth,yes.I have to disagree with another reviewer,in that I liked Braveheart a lot better.At least it brought out my emotions more.This would make a good video game,that is about it.Maybe I just wasn""t in the right mood at the time?Heck-I liked King Arthur with Clive Owen better than this.This is only my opinion."
2,Buy the History Channel DVD,"If you like history this ain't it. This is a made for video game movie. It is slightly better than I can imagine ""Pong the Movie"" would be though."
4,Good Entertainment,Good movie to watch in HD intersting story based on an actual event in History. I enjoyed it
5,Disengage brain and enjoy!,"I was pre-warned that as long as I didn't expect a clever plot or storyline that I would enjoy this gorefest. That being said my expectation was lowered (always a good thing) and 'lo and behold I loved every second of this wonderful movie. Similarly styled to Sin City (and in my opinion Sin City had more style than content) but full of fantastic action scenes that make it worth every cent. There is a storyline and its engaging enough.As my title suggests, disengage your brain and I dare you not to enjoy this flick."
5,"Good stuff, spartans kicking ass and taking names",Have not read the graphic novel but I still enjoyed the visual style and ass kicking that went on. If you like Frank Miller stuff it's a must buy.
4,Amazing!,"This telling is unlike any film I'd seen before.As an artist, I thought it spectacular. As a woman, well... 8-DIt looks like turning the pages of a comic book (aka: graphic novel) in a good way. Though it's bloody, the color of it is nearly black, giving it an artistic edge.The stop-action photography is amazing, the choreographed battle scenes are amazing, and Gerard Butler is AMAZING - his best, in my opinion.Greek mythology has been an interest of mine since grade school, and while I saw the 1960's film which is very good, this version is modern, fresh and very entertaining. I highly recommend it."
5,300 (Combo HD DVD and Standard DVD),"Directed by: Zack SnyderStarring: Gerald ButlerRunning time: 117 min. R - 2007In 2007 I saw the film ""300"" at the theater and it quickly became one of my all time favorites and now watching it in HD only solidifies my opinion of the film. It is great. The movie is based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller and was filmed to match closely with the comic book. Gerald Bulter plays the character of King Leonidas, who leads 300 Spartans into battle against a Persian army of millions and the ""God-King"" Xerxes. The film is very graphic, but done in way that doesn't detract from the story. This is very much a guy flick, but is worth a watch for almost anyone.Own it!"
3,OK BUT HARDLY GREAT,"Only bought this because of Amazon's incredible low price during the black friday sale of 2007 and it didn't dissappoint me, the battle scenes are pretty good and the look of the film is obviously one of a kind. Still, no point comparing it to other truly great films of similar themes such as GLADIATOR and BRAVEHEART which are in another class entirely.I doubt I'll be giving 300 repeated viewings but I'm glad I saw it."
2,Poor SD DVD Transfer,"What really lets this film down for me is the poor quality of the film transfer onto DVD. The movie is shot in a very gloomy sepia style atmosphere. It doesn't look very good on my HDTV, even using a superb SD upscaler. I didn't like the immersion at all - it just looked like junk film work that is better for art festivals. This is an art experiment, not a movie and it doesn't break any new ground. The blood spurts look pretty pathetic at times."
4,Fun Bloodshed At Its Best,"A great STORY (that's what too many people fail to remember) and a great movie. There is no doubt license has been taken with this piece of history, but as a whole, the film is a fine work. Bloody and beautiful, 300 delivers from start to finish."
2,"I could not play it on my DVD player for the TV,",It kept giving me a message like wrong area??? Select another area. I finally got it to work but only on my computer where you have the option to change regions...
1,The DVD doesn't work towards the ends,I had such a high expecations while watching this movie but towards the end I was highly disappointed because the DVDs get very sketchy and froze a lot.
2,Sparta was no place for artists...,Did anyone look at this cover before it went to print? That sword has nothing to do with whatever Leonidas has in his hand.Odd.
5,adrenaline...,Greatest visual performance in movie so far!Perfect adaptation!Great music.First class action!Simple and entertaining plot.Excellent extras on the 2nd DVD.
5,"Spectacular movie, better in HD or Bluray","300 is a spectacular action flick, one of the best movies to come along in a long time. I'd be the first one to admit I'll look for any excuse to watch it again and again. It is that good. My only disappointment with this pricier HD DVD is its a 2-sided disc with standard DVD on one side and HD on the other. My 2-sided discs always seem to get dings on one side or the other."
4,Future Proof your DVD collection...,"Spend a few extra bucks and get the HD DVD combo disc of 300 instead. One side of the disc will play on your current DVD player and the other side will play on an HD DVD player. So if you don't currently own an HD DVD player yet it's ok, you'll have your first title already purchased and will have one less title that you will need to replace when you are ready to make that HD DVD player purchase."
4,Good picture quality,"The picture quality of the movie itself is amazing. There is a very perceivable difference between the SD special features and the HD movie. People say the picture is grainy, but it's because the enviroment calls for dust or ash or embers. If there's one complaint, it is that the contrast seems a little harsher than the DVD which I also have. There are much darker shadows covering more of people's faces, and there are scenes in the sun where the color looks a bit off (compared to the soft yellow-ish hue from the DVD). I love the movie, and overall, I'm happy with my purchase."
3,DON'T BUY THIS ON HD,This movie wasn't what it was all cracked up to be. I was ready for a decent story line and some shocking scenes and it didn't come close. STAY away from this HD DVD since the film has a grainy look to it and you can't tell the difference from HD DVD to DVD format.
3,"Fabulous movie, weak format","One of the most visually stunning action films ever made. The blu-ray lay-out was, unfortunately, weak. No scence seletion. No top menu (film plays immediately upon loading). Rough midpoint transition. Tsk, tsk..."
1,Spines7,I never recieved this item and im very displeased. I really hope this is not how you run your business by not distributing the movies after they are bought.
1,Bad Quality,Most reviewers here are rating movie content. I gave 1 star because this is the worst quality DVD I've ever seen. I couldn't get past 2 minutes because of the grain and fuzziness. Looks like I recorded back and forth between DVD and VHS a couple of times. Returning it tomorrow. Save your money and rent it.
1,Painfully bad,"I'm having a hard time coming up with words to express my contempt for this idiotic, brutal, homophobic garbage. I was dragged to see it in the theatre and emerged feeling as though I had been beaten about the head and shoulders with a heavy stick. The action sequences are brutish and repetitive, the characters are essentially nonexistent, the dialogue is stilted and bloody-minded, and the whole enterprise felt like a video game. The world would be a better place if this movie had never been made."
2,over rated,"the only reason i went to see this movie was because my father wanted to see it, and i found my self staring at my watch throughout the film. the scenes were dragged on and pointless. i am a fan of frank miller graphic novels and enjoyed Sin City alot. but both my dad and i were dissappointed when we left the theater..."
5,Intense and Awesome Film,"300 is one of my all time favorites. The movie is so intense and follows a great battle story of the Spartans vs. the Persians. The story is based off real life events (the battle of Thermopylae). Zack Snyder shoots the movie in such a cool way that it is hard to take your eyes off the screen. From the opening scene of being born into the Spartan culture to the ending scene where it pans out showing a gigantic Spartan battle formation, the movie is breathtaking and very original. HIGHLY recommend! It also has a pretty awesome soundtrack to go along with the various fight scenes."
3,Why do you really love this movie?,"Leather Speedos? Red capes? Muscular, oiled bodies? Penetrating swords and spears? We all know from the history books (or at least Wikipedia) that Spartans practiced buggery, but this is ridiculous. Still, this may be the only movie that unites violence-worshipping comic geeks and drooling drama queens into one satisfied audience, and for that, this film is a landmark.Hollywoodaholic: Confessions of a Screenwriter"
1,300 Movie,"Having read the book that the movie was based on I was very disappointed with the screen version. All the ""special effects"" tended to distract from the actual story which in my opinion is one of the greatest stories of a small group overcoming insurmountable odds in the history of this planet. The film turned it into a bloodfest of epic proportions - which it certainly was - but it was also a triumph of a small group who held a pass long enough for the main army to get settled and eventually kick some Persian butt. So if you have read the book do not have high expectations of the movie."
2,"""Special Edition"" is theft...","...of your money!Warner Bros should be ashamed of putting out such a bare bones ""special edition"" and spreading it out over 2 discs (they easily could have fit these tiny ""making of"" episodes onto one disc.The commentary track is full of silence and the ""making of"" and ""webisodes"" are a few minutes a piece and do not go in depth nor do they go deep into the technical aspects of how they made 300. (One of the most interesting scenes with the Oracle isn't even covered in the making of and is barely mentioned in the commentary.300 is a fantastic movie but it is a shame that a better special edition couldn't have been made."
3,"Loved the comic book, did not really care for the movie","The movie was kind of boring. It looked alright, but the constant slow-mo then speeding up effect wore thin after the first couple times it was used. It's pretty faithful to the book, which I loved, so I really wanted to love this as well. However, it just did not work for me. This movie was pretty average."
5,Worth every penny! Excellent!,"The movie is incredible, one of the most remarkable epic movies of all times. It is Frank Miller's book in motion. Do not expect it to be a documentary about Thermopylae, remember it's Frank Miller we're talking about! The facts are twisted in order to bring the most spectacular story possible. If you like action and epic movies you will not be dissapointed!Special features include: Additional Scenes, Frank Miller's vision realized on Film, 300 Spartans - Fact or Fiction?, Who were the Spartans (how the actors built their characters based on spartan customs), Webisodes (go on set with the cast and crew) and Commentary by Director Zack Snyder."
4,Movie or Annimation?,"The effects are great; sometimes you could'nt tell real from annimated although the actors were all well above average. There were a few 'bloopers' even a novice could spot,it could not be written as hostorically correct,and this movie is a definate 'no'for young children,but all in all- I thought it was great!"
5,AWESOME BETTER ON HD-DVD THAN ON BLU-RAY,"This movie is an epic event, just amazing and a stunning film to be put into high defintion. Both formats should be happy to have such a great movie on their format. Though the hd version is superior with extra web features, a combo format disc, and the blu-ray version has noticable problems with the encoding causing some glitchy spots. But atleast they got it too!"
3,Disappointed,This movie was not what I thought it would be even after reading the preview. It really did not fit my taste for what I consider a good movie.
2,Pretty Lame,Horrible Movie. I usually dig these kind of movies but the real story turned into an almost scifi fanatasy.
1,More like a student film....,"Is not even in the same league as Braveheart or Gladiator, or even Troy! More like Alexander. Bad acting, lots and lots of shouting dialogue over nothing, the voices of some of the actors were modified and sounded like they were being done by Frank Oz, a boy being stalked by a cartoon wolf, Xerxes looking (and sounding) like a drag queen, heavy metal music added to the soundtrack to keep up the drama level in the interest of post pubescent males, lots of bloodshed but never any blood splattering and staying on the actors since it was digital blood,. Cinematography? What cinematography? The entire movie was shot against a green screen. You could have dropped a dance club background in and the movie would have looked like West Hollywood on Halloween."
1,A Bit Behind,"I have to admit that i am a bit behind on the times, because i just got around to watching this ""movie"". I had read the graphic novel, and it was amusing I suppose, Not a big fan of Miller or the movies based on his works.300 really made my evening, seriously, I havent laughed that hard at a movie in years, well laughed that hard at a movie that isnt supposed to be funny. I get that its not supposed to be ""realistic"" in either looks or acting or backround but it quite campy and super simplistic and seriously over the top. Xerxes, oh how i wish i could just put him in my closet and open it up and make him talk to me, maybe sing a showtune or two!!!I love Gerard, but he doesnt make the best choices when it comes to roles. I will forgive him for this one, perhaps he just needed to get into shape."
4,Not for children!,"Was a pretty good movie. I got this for christmas. Was a $5 promo deal from black friday I believe. I enjoyed this movie. I admit it took awhile to get it's hold on me because the beginning was a bit dull. For some reason I had a hard time understanding what was being said or going on so I had to turn on the subtitles. Maybe I'm just getting old lol. But this movie was good. Even the special features were interesting and the clip about the history of the movie and how it was based on true events.The movie is priced pretty low and it's blu ray so go ahead and pick it up. An inexpensive addition to your blu ray collection and a very good movie. No regrets. May not be suitable for kids tho. Some pretty bloody scenes and some adult content as well. It's a very violent movie. Course, most war movies are."
5,300,"One of the best movies of the year, both graphics and over-the-top acting. You gotta give Snyder and the whole crew credit for the effort put into this. Plus the transfer onto Blu-ray is amazing."
3,Everything is Slow Motion,"As expected, lots of blood, fighting, and gore. Unfortunantly it seems that at least 50% of the movie is in slow motion. Every fight sceen (and those make up the majority of the movie) along with the required sex sceen. Way too much slow mo."
3,okay movie,"I waited until 300 came out on DVD to view it. The battle sequences are pretty good, but it is an average movie, overall. I didn't care for the way it was photographed. It has a strange color palette."
5,Simply Amazing,"Not only is the HD video quality amazingly sharp and detailed, the sound is also great. The action from this movie may be a little slow at first, but as soon as the battle starts, there's no stopping.The great thing about HD DVD is the ability to have PiP to watch the whole movie in blue screen while the actual movie is playing. From that you can see how the movie was made, and the different affects and CGs that were added to it. I really enjoyed seeing what was ""real"" vs. what was ""computer generated"" for this movie. I haven't tried the web-enabled feature yet, but from what I've seen so far, I highly doubt I would be dissapointed.(And for a few dollars more, the Combo disc is so worth it. I can watch it on my HD DVD player, or I can lend it to my friend and let them watch the DVD side. Or, I can go to another room and enjoy the DVD side. Great flexibility)."
3,"Not my thing, but good.","Honestly this movie was not my cup of tea, but that is just a personal opinion, there is alot of blood and gore but if that is what you're looking for this is definitely the movie for you. I am buying this today for my fiance who loved the movie, so I think it must be a guy thing.With that said, I will say that it was beautifully made, the effects are breath-taking, and when I wasn't squirming in my seat at the theater I was in amazement about how good the computer work was on this.All in all, it is definitely not for the faint of heart, but if you are looking for a good guy flick with alot of blood (and I mean alot) this is the movie for you."
1,Very Disappointed,I thought it would be something like 'Gladiator'. Instead it was a dreary colored computerized show - it was more like looking at one of those super hero comic books only the characters are moving. Not anywhere near portraying an actual event. Total waste of money.
1,Simply Terrible,"It may do well by the graphic novel it is based on, but for anything else---well it is simply terrible. A wreckless work for all mankind. The dignity it lacks would shame a Spartan."
5,Best Film Of The Decade,"I saw this film at a studio screening in Los Angeles. Tyler Bates constructed a soundtrack that is as amazing and striking as the rest of the film.Generally, I fall asleep in a movie theatre unless the imagery is overwhelmingly spectacular. I was awake through the entire length - even the credits - of this film. 300 is the most amazing combination of violent destruction and graceful elegance I believe I have ever witnessed on the big screen. The damn thing was so intense I wanted to be *in* the film."
1,A very boring Movie.,"Perhaps I am out of sync with the others who enjoyed this movie; but I found it very boring and tedious, and was glad when it finally ended. I didn't care for the artifical CG sky, and some of the monstrosities were so repulsive that I couldn't stand looking at them. The sad part if it all is that Gerard Butler is an excellent actor and his bellowing and ranting in this movie does not do his talent justice at all. All in all I felt like I was watching a comic strip on film. I just didn't enjoy it at all."
1,horrilbe movie,this was a awlful movie the story was bad and i would never tell any one too watch this movie the real story is better not the worst movie ive seen but its right up there please do not watch this movie if your looking for a good history movie watch gladiator or brave heart or rob roy
3,Newer version to be released,Warner is apparently already going to re-issue this Blu-ray to match the features on the HD DVD. I am shocked that Warner would do this to Blu-ray supporters.
1,Truly Awful,"I don't understand how anyone could have enjoyed this truly awful movie. The filming is bizarre and unrealistic, and the acting is overdone and trite."
3,What???,"This movie is very odd. The movie is filled with halfnaked people running with spears and disfigured people who try to kill eachother. What's with all the monsters? When I saw the movie I was thinking it would be somewhat realistic then I see Xerxes with his genderconfused prowse.The movie is supposed to be based on the battle between the massive Persian Army and the 300 spartans, which is odd considering how many the Spartans kill. The fighting in this movie is entertaining so I think 300 is a movie you could rent at least, and the conflict between King Leonidas [king of spartans] and Xerxes ['godking' of the Persians who likes to say he's kind] is very interesting. This movie is mediocre at best and it's corny one liners and action will entertain you, so it's worth a try. Oh and why were there ninjas in it?"
1,Just plain horrible.,"I was impressed with the special effects and some of the fight scenes, but overall this movie was terrible. I've come to expect some historical inaccuracies in movies, which is fine as long as they are not too eggregious and the story is good, but this movie had them in spades. The movie ""Gladiator"" was flawed but was vastly superior and far more enjoyable than this flick. I was pleased that they got the Spartan training right, yet what was up with this film? Am I watching the re-telling of a true historical event or a cheap knock-off of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy? Every bad character was depicted as some kind of demon and there were monsters in this. Say what?!? The real story of the Battle of Thermopylae is one of the greatest from the ancient world, with real characters that still inspire people to this day. I hope someone else will take up this story and do a better job with it because this one stunk."
1,bad movie,"What is this all scenes of blood and violence, for whatever ideal it is. I could not continue watching this film, just stopped after about 30 minutes. Do not waste your money."
5,IT'S GREAT MOVIE!!!,I didn't see the movie at theaters but I downloaded the unbox when this movie came out. This movie was great. Whole scene was fantastic. Just I like it.
4,Excessive Film Grain,"I would have given a 5 star rating for this product if not for the excessive film grain. If this was intentional on the part of the director or the producer, I believe most people wouldn't like it. One the whole, I still find this to be a very good release."
5,Best Looking Blu-Ray!!!,I have over 20 Blu-Ray movies and this is the best looking movie I own. Some people complain about the grittiness of this movie but I saw it at the theater (twice) and it had the same look. But to me the Blu-Ray version looks even better than in the movies. This is a must own for any who owns a Blu-Ray player.
4,300 DVD,When I received the product the inside of the case was broken resulting in the DVD bumping around inside. Other then that everything came quickly and undamaged.
4,300 Shot A Certain Way....,"Just watched 300 in Blu Ray.... Great sound... Visuals looked good, but 300 was shot a certain way with grain... It's still there. This isn't 80's movies grain we are talking about here, it's a different type of grain.Still a lot of fun."
2,Great movie - for the teenage boy in your family,"If you want a movie that's light on plot and quality acting, full of long but unconvincing battle scenes with a touch of light sexuality, then this movie is for you."
5,Wow! Outrageous movie!,"If you love Grecian history and guys who talk really loud and pronounced... If you can stand the killing, this is a visual adventure worth taking. You'll definitely want to see it more than once."
5,300 WOW's,This is an absolutely amazing pack. The video is brilliant and to have it in a pack with the collectible helmet is just a dream. Everyone should have one of these.
4,Brilliant movie,"Hi,I have seen the movie before so it really is a good movie, hence me buying it.I however have not recieved this order. I normally recieve my Amazon orders about 2 weeks after placement...Please let me know if there is any problem with the order?Regards,Gavin"
3,This is history!!!,"Well this movie is making of history again. I like the spartons & the king spartus. well frank miller is good at movies like that. And the backgrounds of the movie is not okay for my knowledge. Comparing with ""Sin City"" this movie is far away from it.Anyhow I loved this movie only a little. The best parts are the action sequences. the way the blood spreads around everywhere is fantastically done. Good special effects though.ZT"
4,Good,"It's unlike anything I have seen before. I got bored for a couple of minutes but the action is great. Only thing I didn't like is the fact that the movie ends like there is going to be a sequel, or maybe it's just me."
3,Good - if you aren't looking for reality,"The movie itself was well done - good acting and cinematography, etc. There were a lot of inaccuracies that were hard to ignore, such as the 8 ft tall Xerxes that looked more Egyptian than Persian, King Leonidas having a Sean Connery accent, the Persians paying off the Spartan Legislator, and the obviously fake creatures fighting for the Persians.If you can separate the movie from reality you will enjoy it, just don't expect an accurate representation of the battle."
2,Bluray Quality???,I have no quibbles with 300 as a movie but................do I have a faulty bluray copy or is the picture quality really that bad and grainy???
5,Best movie of the decade,Wow a movie without a politically correct message.A film where soldiers are not portrayed as suckers fighting for an unjust cause.A story about standing up and taking a stand against tryanny.No wonder it was so well recieved.A generation spoon fed p.c. bs finally gets to see a movie that speaks to the heroic ideas born within.
2,"Good, entertaining corn","300 is like a giant, goofy video game, with silly history and far too much CGI for one motion picture. It feels like a giant comic book, which, I guess, was what it was supposed to be. Visual and shallow.The film starts out interesting enough with the rough warrior childhood details, then veers into some silliness with religious elders (who, in accordance with traditional Hollywood perception of religion, are all corrupt perverts), then gets into non-stop battle footage, with occasional lapses back to a disinteresting sub-plot in Sparta.The battle footage looks like non-stop video game cutscenes (and even the 300 video game, advertised at the beginning of the dvd, looked like scenes taken from the film.)The spartan warriors seem more like WWE stars that ancient warlords (are they wearing tights and a cape?)Just silly. Watchable, but silly."
3,Impressive Graphics,"If you're familiar with the comic book adaptation movie genre, ala Sin City, you'll recognize the same approach in 300. As a historical drama the movie is flawed, but as a doomed buddy film its entertaining. The parallels to the current day political scene are obvious. The racial overtones of the movie were unnecessary. It's a good movie to watch once or twice, but its not one that I'll go back to time and time again."
5,Amazon is great,"I bought this for my nephew for Christmas and He was thrilled to get it.I must say that of all the websites out there these days and the concern about idenity theif, where one has axcess to your creditcard information. I have been using Amazon for years and it is a very trusted website."
3,300 Pixels(?),"This movie's story is somewhat shallow and I never really cared about the characters. Do not, I repeat, ""Do Not"" spend extra money to own this on Blu-ray its just not worth it. The movie is extremely grainy and may have been done this way purposefully. My point is if you can get it on DVD for a fraction of the cost go that route. The CGI is impressive at times but never really excellent. When its all said and done 300 is a movie you will soon forget."
4,one of the best...,"this movie was so much better then i had expected...it kept me glued to my seat until the end,lots of action and a little humor at times but a great story and presented very well. i loved it"
5,300 is AWESOME!!,"I love this movie on dvd, and it's AWESOME on BLURAY!!!PS Gerard Butler is sooooooo amazing! Ladies you could watch this movie on mute and be just as happy!!! hahaha"
5,Kicks @ss,"This movie just kicks @ss.......plain and simple. Each line Butler gives is better than the last, the action is brilliant, there is honor, bravery, loss, courage, revenge, betrayal.......Butlers voice can be kind of stereotypical after a while. A buddy of mine has been poking fun at it with sayings like ""SPARTANS, BE SURE TO WASH BEHIND THE EARS!!!!!!"" But wow, what a ride this movie is. One of my all time fav's."
3,Nice film,This was a good movie. But I know me and if it werent for the special effects i wouldnt have sat through all of it. The acting was actualy ok and the story was cool. But the part I liked most was the visual style. The only real gripe i have is that I dont remember ever seeing 300 men. There were groups of men but never did I see more than a couple dozen at most on screen. So if youre looking for a simple action film that has a real cool visual style than this is for you.
5,A great movie (and even a greater book - Gates of Fire),This movie moves to the top of my list for movies about bravery and/or character. It's right up there with Braveheart and The Emperors Club. An incredible story with some great acting/screenplay and special effects.
5,Buy it today.,"This movie is amazing. If you loved Sin City, you're going to love ""300."" I'm also a big fan of ""Gladiator."" The sepia tones and white diffused combinations are just beautiful. The graphics are great, and the fighting scenes are well choreographed. Plus, it has a good plot/story behind it.I bought the Blu-Ray version because I'm using my PS3 for playback. But, if you have/prefer hd-dvd, then get that version. The HD-DVD version has some extra features that those who own the format may enjoy.Again, order it today. You're going to love it."
2,Freeezzz in Chapter 14!!!!!!!!!,"I wait for a long time this movie, in this Format, And the movie Freezz from chapter 14, I own the HD-DVD of Xbox 360, I don`t know is that problem is only with my HD-DVD, But I read other reviews and it looks that they have the same problem. Don`t get these disc, till you know If there going to be an other Edition of these HD-DVD."
3,Could've been Better,"After watching this movie the other day, I have to say it left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm funny about Hollywood messing around with ancient history so you may not want to use me as a guide for this review of 300.Miller has talent. I don't think many would dispute that claim. However, his talent lies in his original material such as Sin City and not his bent on classical history, for example. I found it difficult to suspend disbelief when I saw the scene with the Delphic Oracle or the various creatures throughout the film.I will say the battle scenes are well done and the acting is pretty decent which is why I decided to give this three stars instead of two.In the end, Miller is better off sticking to what he knows and should not venture too far from his area of expertise. My Greek and Roman Tragedy professor even liked it. Like I said, I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to things historical so don't go by me. But, play it safe and watch this as a rental.Thanks."
2,300....only on a scale of 1000 - 2 stars!,"A retelling of the ancient Battle of Thermopylae but adapted from Frank Miller's Graphic Novel offers over stylized battle scenes at the expense of story. 300's major flaws are how it makes this heroic story of 300 Spartans a flat and dreary affair outside of it's CGI - in fact you'll think you've seen it before because it rips off every sword and sandal epic up through Gladiator. In fact 300 freely borrows its soundtrack, dramatic presence and iconic imagery from that film. Gladiator is recent enough in moviegoers minds that the blatant ripoffs are truly lazy and cheesy. The other flaw is a cringe worthy script that in light of current headlines are so simplistic and aggrandizing as to make one wonder if comic books are all the filmakers read(apart from Gladiator that is)."
1,Whats with the quality???,"Ive just received this blu ray disc. Where is the quality. Its seems to me like a dvd disc not better, but i have a ps3 and played on it... Awful quality."
5,300,"A stunning piece of filmmaking. This movie makes you feel for the characters and never lets up with intensity. If a Greeks 200 years ago were to tell a story about the legend of the mighty Spartans, it would probably be something like this."
1,300,buy the dvd version.the hi-def version is VERY grainy & backgrounds flicker so much you may have a seizure. excellent movie bad format to view in
5,Great Movie!,I love this movie and searched this site for it. Found it at a great low price. Fast delivery and well packaged. Now its part of my DVD collection. Thankyou !
1,300 Blu Ray SUCKS compared to HD DVD,What is going on with Blu ray...HD DVD has so many more cool features than the Blu Ray version...I own a PS3 and can't get these features because of Blu Ray. The same thing happen with Blood Diamond...HD DVD blows away the Blu Ray Disc with extra features...I am sick and tired with Blu Ray not being up to par with HD DVD...so I have decided I won't wait for Blu Ray titles anymore I will buy them on HD DVD...therefore I will be purchasing a HD DVD player this week. Plus I can get a HD DVD player for around $250...very disappointed in Blu Ray.
4,"I LOVE Gerard Butler, I liked the movie","It's not that this isn't a well done movie, but it wasn't exactly my cup of tea...However I ALWAYS have been, and ALWAYS will be in love with the VERY talented and INCREDIBLY sexy Gerard Butler, so he saved the movie in my opinion!"
3,Unbelievable,Once I found out this movie was based on a comic book I decided to cut it a bit more slack.
1,??????????????,"Dear Sirs,Question!How can I adequately review a product that I ordered but never recieved?Rodney Kase Tyrone10-6-2008"
2,It's worth watching once.,"The lighting is so dark that it's very difficult to see in many scenes. The scenery look like video games which I don't like. Many times, the scenery look so obviously created by computer graphics that it clearly shows the low budget of this film. The fighting scenes are not as thrilling and real as Kingdom of Heaven or Gladiator.It's worth watching once."
5,Special edition well worth it,"If you were a fan of the movie, the special edition is worth getting for the extras. There are some interesting documentaries about the making of the movie, the graphic novel, and the history. It also has some awesome deleted scenes."
4,300,"This is a very good action movie, it does stray from the historical points of the battle at Thermoplae, but over all very well made film."
5,"Great movie, great deal","I was very satisfied with the condition the DVD arrived in and I already knew the movie itself was amazing, having seen it in the theaters. The price was unbeatable and the DVD made a great Christmas gift."
4,Loved it!,"I loved the movie, which is why i bought the dvd, it was cheaper than the store and columbia house specials."
2,Something was missing...,"Was it too short? Or too long? The action was good ; I suppose that was the movie's general aim. But there was a failed storyline or something! Watch it if you want to see some Spartans do their thing. But if you want something that will draw you in, other than blood and appendages flying off, go elsewhere."
3,Visual Issues?,"I just bought an HD DVD player, and the first HD DVD I watched was 300. The picture looked really ""grainy"" or ""pixelly"". I'm just wondering if anyone else has this issue, since all of my other HD DVDs looked amazing. I was really disappointed in how ""unclear"" it was."
5,Action packed!,"This movie is a gripping masterpiece not only because of its action but also because of the way in which if is filmed. I believe that this was shot with Citizen Kane in mind. The dramatic screen shots to the slow motion capture emotion that if not used might have categorized this as a ""B"" movie."
2,One star for decaps; one star for spearings.,How can anyone like a movie with black computer-generated blood splatter ? This is one of those films where it seems the director can't decide if it should be in black and white or in color. This story was better done on the history channel with total animation. I did like the through-and-through spearings and the quick-slice decapitations in the battle scenes. Cool. A little creativity there. I didn't care about any grainy scenes on this blu-ray disc since I didn't like the movie anyway. Save your money. Rent or borrow it.
2,bad disk,"Loved the movie, problem is that my new sony 550 BD system, 1 out 10 wont read the this Blue-ray dvd. I have other BD and they all get loaded fine. i'm thinking it could because I bought it on Amazon, will try to buy other BD's to see if it is Amazon items that are not good qualities. I hope not...."
4,GREAT MOVIE,BATTLE SCENES ARE GREAT AND SPECIAL EX ALSO. ONLY THING I HAVE A COMPLIANT ABOUT IS THAT IT WAS TO SHORT.
5,300 RULZ!!!!!!,300 is one of the best movies based on a comic. The effects are terrific and truly believable. If you haven't seen 300 I suggest you get it now because it is one of the best films of 2007. I also suggest you don't watch it with children because there is lots of action and violence. 300 is AWESOME!!!
4,300 - Review,"Zack Snyder directs this faithful adaptation of Frank Miller's (Sin City) graphic novel about the storied Battle of Thermopylae, a conflict that pitted the ancient Greeks against the Persians in 480 B.C. The film, which blends live-action shots with virtual backgrounds to capture Miller's original vision, co-stars Gerard Butler, Lena Headey, David Wenham, Vincent Regan, Rodrigo Santoro and Dominic West."
5,A new action instant classic,"Reminds me of when I first saw the Matrix and thought this movie would be a fan favorite for years to come. Certainly the best action film I have seen so far in 2007, and that's including the summer blockbusters..One critique if there is one. I wonder why Miller did not follow the full legend and story. I would think the Oracle's original prophecy that a Spartan prince must die or Sparta will burn, would have added to the dramaticism of this movie. According to the legend Leonidas went to the battle of Thermopylae with the intention of fighting to the death from the very beginning. Also, according to history, the third day of battle even when the Spartans were surrounded, lasted for hours! I would have liked to have seen a bigger final battle scene, but alas, this version works just as well."
1,Never Again,I loved all of the Clash of the Titans and expected this movie to be somewhat in the small ball park. After everyone recommending this movie to me I finally caved and ordered it. I was extremely disapointed. Great war scenes but the story line needed help.
3,300,"This title was as enjoyable at home as it was in the theater. Sadly I feel that the DVD version would have been just as good as the BluRay. In the era where high definition is king, the 300 BluRay failed to capitalize on that angle by maintaining the films grainy appearance. And although the grain is meant to portray atmosphere, it does not do a HD setup justice. The features were sorely lacking and I fear that this title will suffer from ""DVDitis"" in that multiple releases of this product will feature the ""Unrated"" and ""Director's Cut"" moniker that almost all the current DVD's are subjected to. The special features were sorely lacking, although the ones on the BluRay were good, I feel that they could have done a better job at including more being that the BluRay format has more potential in terms of storage. Rent before you buy, you might be glad you did."
5,great movie and better on blu-ray,"A friend and I saw 300 in theaters and we both decided that we absolutly had to have it on DVD when it came out. I was originally going to get it on regular DVD, but then about a week before it came out, I got a PS3.So i decided to spend the extra 5 or 6 bucks on it, and get it on blu-ray. I am so glad that I did because the special effects are so smooth and blend in more with the movie. It is a great movie and is even better on blu-ray. So just spend the extra 6 bucks and get more than the regular DVD option has to offer."
5,Great,Great movie and to get it in high def was totally awesome. I enjoyed watching my husband's face light up when he saw this title.
4,Entertaining,"Everything seem right about this picture when i watched the trailer, and to be honest I believe the best lines of the script were said in the trailer, I believe there were times in the film when the queen just couldn't believe to herself what she was saying and that lead to a poor performance, the king's dialog was at times empty, Metal kind of music just does not go with this movie, the best performance I believe belongs to Xerxes.The movie was abundant in cheesy dialogs, some actors would have performed better if a nice script was provided.Picture was superb, acting was OK, this could have been a great movie, this could have been my favorite, I like these kind of films (Gladiator, Troy, etc) but i think i'll keep the movie trailer but not the film itself."
2,Regular,"Its a good movie, but it came in bad conditions, it looks like it was touched with something hot, because it is melted in the front cover."
2,"Same Ole Hollywood BS -blue eyes, British accents & sex","Here we have Mediterranian type (Greeks), yet Hollywood can't get away from showing most of the actors with --BLUE eyes. Blue eues? Get real!Supposedly this film it is to attract primarily an American audience, but the actors have British accents who can't but wait to say Sire versus Sir. What's wrong with the neutral American accent? Worse. This film took every opportunity to show needless smutty (nudes) sex."
1,Where is it?,"I rented it, paid for it and now I can't watch it. Since I can't watch it, I give this movie 1 star. I called for help, but the people that can help me are not working now. What a rip-off. I guess I'll have to go to Walmart. It's no wonder the Walton family are so rich."
3,Hello there.,"Good movie with fantastic special effects. For an action movie it gets 4 stars. The film is brought down by 1 dimensional characters and not enough emotion. Even if it wasn't filmed in front of a blue screen, I still wouldn't have believed it happaned. For an epic it gets 2 stars.Action movie: 4 starsEpic: 2 starsOverall: 3 stars."
2,Really,"I realize this was fantasy, however, it was not necessary to make it rediculous. People don't run around nude in the snow."
1,Homoerotic nonsense.,I felt very uncomfortable watching this movie. I thought I was in for some decent historical non-fiction but I was duped into watching men engage in bathhouse style situations and magical fantasy.
3,alright,"I just saw this movie its alright comparing it with Immortals, The immortals was better much more passion to the movie. Plus it showed more debt. The movie 300 and Immortals seem to be in same category if I had to guess. The Ugly Truth the whole movie is friendly to watch plot of story was strong. Gerard Butler played in. I would recommend The Ugly Truth."
5,Recibido,"Magnifica obra, todo un clasico para guardar en mi biblioteca particular, gracias por esta oportunidad de tener cosas valiosas del septimo arte"
5,WE ARE SPARTANS!,This was a incredible movie! The look of the film was awesome. Can't wait for the sequel! Blu ray looks great!
3,"love this movie, but digital copy is expired(beware)","Would have given it 5 stars but the digital copy had expired(buyer beware digital copies do expire), which is one of the reasons I bought this pack, other than that love the collectors edition."
3,OK,I personally didn't love this. but I know a lot of others that have so I think it just wasnt a movie for me. But worth watching once.
4,300 complete Bluray Book,i have already have this reguler edition. But i buy agaian because it's promo prices. I have one disc because this new print don't have digital copy makes price lower. i see this edition is similiar with reguler edition. New only at features The Complete 300: Comprehensive Immersion and Bluescreen Picture-in-Picture Experience. So if u like this book may be u think twice because there's no much a lot different with picture and sound.
2,"Odd, very graphic violence, not stellar","This is a very graphic movie. The violence here is unlike any other movie I've seen. It's not incredibly disturbing, just gory and unneccessary. Having a ton of scenes in slow motion does not make a movie epic. The story is OK but not unlike many other movies about the same time period. The actors are good. I don't buy the hype though."
2,300 blu ray,"The film is good at reflecting what is basically a comic book version of a war supposedly fought a long time ago between the Greeks and the Persians. The story is based on a deranged comic book writer who views history from an us versus them point of view and somehow decides that Greek culture is western culture.Anyway coming back to the movie, the whole movie is made up in the studio and shows it with the graphics very unreal and the images blurry and dull. The movie is very gory and is just an exercise in sword and spear piercing of the human flesh.It is basically a comic book made into a film and should appeal to those who view death and destruction as a past-time to be enjoyed.The quality of the film as a blu ray movie is not fantastic nor is the sound track."
3,"Good warrior movie, well made, but not for the family","I got my HD-DVD version of 300. This is a good warrior movie and gives some historical information which is interesting and is well made and the new web special features are nice, but the movie is certainly not for general family viewing even adults. Of course it's rated R, but some of the violent scences are just too over the top sometimes even for R rating for entertainment purposes even if they probably did happen back then."
2,What's so special about this?,"First blu-ray disc I've bought, and first time seeing this movie. Disappointed on both counts. Blu-ray technology is not much ahead of regular dvd if at all. The movie itself was not impressive. Gladiator + Lord of the Rings + God of War. That's a formula which should've been cool but managed to be nothing special. Why do some people think this is brilliant? I never got excited though I really hoped I would. A summary of this movie would be: clouds and sunlight, abs of steel, slow motion stabbing and blood, some CGI critters. If you can get more out of it than that, you must be a genius. 300 isn't nearly as creative as some people imagine."
1,Amazon's false advertising,"I wasted 10 minutes trying to find the HD Tivo-ready Unbox verson of this movie.Amazon is currently advertising this movie on the front of it's web site. It shows the picture:1. on a wide-screen HD monitor2. with a Series3 Tivo3. and Unbox download service logoBut,--The movie is listed as ""Currently Unavailable"" as a rental or purchase.--Amazon Unbox does not offer HD content.--Amazon Unbox does not offer widescreen pictures, only 4:3 ratio with letterboxing.If they aren't ready to launch, perhaps Amazon should consider ethical marketing practices. Unbox is the biggest load of hype I've seen since Windows 98 or Vista.Does Amazon want to be in that same brand category?Please don't waste our time."
4,Great guy flick,"Very ""graphic novel""-ish and not very historically accurate. The sets remind me of 'Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow'. CG everything. I like it a lot. It is not a landmark film. It is not full of inspiring performances by big name icons of the industry. It is very entertaining in a ""fast food"" kind of way. I got tired watching it from testosterone overload. I am glad I bought it."
5,Blu-ray,come on people blu-ray vs hd blu-ray is better but do you even have your stuff hooked up right do you have your setting right for the ps3 are you cheap do you use rsa cable when you should use hdmi cables (which right now are the best out there)
2,DVD Review,"The movie is good (6/10), and the visual style bumps it up to 8/10. The direction, the memorable lines, and the comic book style are all perfect. But this DVD is sparse on the extras. The only extra is the director's commentary. It's a great extra but in order to see all the featurettes about the historical battle or behind the scenes you must buy the two-disc version."
5,"Watch this movie now, i said now!!!","One of the top three movies of allllll time. Yes its that good, it makes you want to jump out of your seat, grab a shield and a spear, and win the fight yourself."
1,A Hate Affair,"Quick movie synopsis: A bunch of angry, alpha male, insecure and inadequate white boys who weren't hugged enough by their mothers hating life and eachother, spreading their germ of hate across the world for some quick power and ego boosting. Ug Ug ooga ooga bang on your chest and find a cliff. I wish all these macho fools would just shut up and go have a good cry under a palm tree. Who finds this crap entertaining, probably the lowest common denominator of a human being? And why bother using live action, 300 looked like a cartoon. A mess of a movie for the planet of the apes."
4,The 300 (revisted),"This highly stylized re-telling of the Battle of Thermoplyae, takes you into the darker side of that historical conflict. Frank Miller (the world's oldest 15-year old) uses his unique and rather bleak world-view as a focusing lens for his latest film. The Spartans are called upon to hold off the largest army the world has ever seen, and after an epic battle, they are killed to a man (no spoilers here, the story is over 2,000 years old). High production value, moderate over-acting, gut-wrenching action, too many lens filters and mutants. What else do you want?"
1,"Buy DVD version, its' the same","First of all, I watched this movie in the theatre before it came out and thought it was an excellent movie. However, I borrowed my friend's 300 on blu-ray and the picture quality is awful. I'm not bashing on blu-ray because I do enjoy the rest of my blu-ray movies such as apocalypto and planet earth. I am watching it on a Samsung 46"" 1080p resolution LCD TV (PlayStation 3)."
3,MST3K Fans Rejoice -- Rifftrax is Here!,"A small band of brave men struggle against enormous odds, battling a superior force, and though ultimately they are defeated their sacrifice becomes a source of inspiration and hope that rings out like a clarion call through the pages of history. But enough about the Mighty Ducks. 300, in contrast, is about a gang of shirtless and immoral baby-killing idiots who hack up a larger group of idiots on some cliff in Greece a couple of thousand years ago. To a soundtrack of ersatz Nine Inch Nails.Starring Gerard Butler as a shrieking inarticulate Scotsman (so in other words ""a Scotsman""), 300 delivers on its promise to be the bloodiest movie since Carrie 2: Carrie vs. Saw. (Though it should be noted that in lieu of blood, 300 utilized digital globs of diluted road tar.)To make it a fair fight, Mike enlisted the help of battle veterans Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy. 3 against the 300! This...is...RIFFTRAX!"
2,Poor Quality Ruins a Good Movie,"The compression is horrible. I have a $2.99 single layer Three Amigos DVD that looks better. You probably won't notice the poor video quality on a standard def. television but it's hard to stomach on an HD TV. I have a Sony upconverting DVD player and it has always given me an outstanding picture on my 50' HD Sony SXRD, but not even a great upconverting DVD player can save this DVD. I love the movie but two stars is all I can give this DVD."
1,Zzzzzzz...zzzzzz...zzzzz,"Huh? What? Is it over yet? Good GRIEF this movie is boring, tried several times on two consecutive nights to sit through it and....zzzzzzz....oh man, did I nod off AGAIN????Incredibly stupid dialogue and insanely bad writing, historically hilarious, the worst sex scene in movie history, and generally the most intelligence-insulting film in recent memory. This one is for fanboy man-boys only--and virtually no one else. For those determined to see this stinker: Good luck and SWEET DREAMS!!!"
1,Horrible Gladiator Ripoff,"First this movie is so long and boring, I almost turned it off twice! It focuses more on the slow motion kill scenes and the back drops than the acting or story line, which is weak anyway. This movie tries so hard to be another Gladiator! Even down to the wife and child in the wheat field at the end of the movie! Totally inaccurate historically and downright dumb. Only a few would enjoy this type of movie. Honestly this movie just sucked. Very disappointed in the acting and the story. Only one star. Avoid! Don't even rent it!"
3,CGI movie blood,"Movie arrived loose in package, shaken loose by shipping?Movie was CGI bloodfest, blood and spears all over. Story line and fight scenes were done well. The Spartan men's airbrushed abs were funny. Gerald Butler was quite fit, but most of the men were airbrushed, looked fake."
4,Blood and Thunder,"300 (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)I received this video several days before the date it was due. I'm not really in to this type of movie, but it had me sitting here spellbound. It was a good movie and I would recommend it to others."
5,Worth to have this Title in your Hometheater Rack,"300... No doubts about it., Its an awesome movie. Worth to have it your Hometheater Rack. This is been my first purchase from Amazon.com and it took almost 40days to reach me(INDIA) I had purchase it on 05May11. Unfortunately i have received in broken case situation. Packing could have been better. would appreciate if they made it good for my next purchase."
3,300 Ultimate Warriors!,"Very good movie! Highly entertaining. You feel the honor and repect for their country and people...I think they could show more battle scenes and less about the families.If you never seen this movie before, you will be entertained! WB"
4,Nice extras on the 300 DVD,"Good picture on blu-ray, but I don't know if it would be much different on DVD since the lighting in the movie is pretty dark."
4,The 300,"Overall, an excellent video experience. My only complaint is historical accuracy of the clothing worn by the Spartans. The director made an arbitrary decision to do away with the traditional Spartan armor, and portray the Spartans minimum clothing.Very well done. Would love to see it in wide screen, 3D."
3,"Visually stunning, poor story telling","This is a rough rendering of the battle of Thermopylae where the 300 Spartans held off the Persian Army for 3 days at a narrow pass in northern Greece. I rated the movie a 3 to balance the weak story telling with the stunning visual display. I enjoyed the movie but found it to be highly fictional and it took many liberties with history. In some ways it reminded me of The return of the King with similar creatures and persian versions of trolls. Lots of guts, gore, and glory, graphic, but not grotesque. See it in the movies it will lose a lot on DVD"
2,Excellent movie but it sucks on Blu Ray,"I watched this movie on Blu-Ray and I have to say it's one of the grainiest Blu-Ray's I've ever watched. I had to double check to see if it was in fact a Blu-Ray disc and not a DVD. The grain may have been added on purpose but it didn't look intentional to me, anyone with a brain can tell you that this is way too grainy for it to even qualify for Blu-Ray.Don't get me wrong, the movie is great. I've seen it a million times and it's always entertaining but I'm just reviewing this movie from at Blu-Ray quality stand point.You're better off buying the DVD version, specially if it's going to save you money."
2,A little Dissapointed in Picture Quality,"I bought 300 on blue about a week after it came out. When i played it on my 42 inch samsung, from my ps3 it looked like absolute grainey garbage. I went to stores like circuit city and best buy and they said the picture looked grainey because of the cgi it was filmed in. It serious looks so bad where i just want to watch it on a normal tv, so i don't feel like im watching this movie during Hurricane Katrina."
2,"disappointed, and poor quality, too","Teach me to buy DVD without seeing it first. It was visually interesting, but that was spoiled my murky transfer.I really was eager for this to come out. Yet things were so much style and no substances. Way too much slow-motion. Not enough plot. So much attention to gore in the slow effect form, but they battle seemed over in a blink. I expected something more like Helm's Deep or Braveheart, even Troy.Just felt like why bother? Rent it first, then decide."
5,What HD-DVD was made for!,"Don't get caught up in the format war hype. This HD-DVD is a winner with OUTSTANDING picture and sound. A full package of behind-the-scenes documentaries, interviews, games, downloads, and super cool blue-screen making of PIP mode with running commentary rounds out this package... Oh, and you can play the other side on a standard DVD player too.Bottom Line is if you have HD-DVD... get this NOW! Great Movie! Great HD-DVD!Enjoy!"
5,Anointing,"Ray's music has truly brought forth an anointing in my life. Each track has a blessing attached to it that is unbelievable. He ministers to your spirit and your dancing feet. It's great for pre-teens and teens because of the diversity of musical rhythms. My daughter, 6 years old, loves it in its entirety. We have been blessed by this glorious selection. Keep it coming Ray!"
3,Not Quite the Hammer I thought it was,This hammer does not have a milled face like the info said it did. It pings like a piano tuner. Other wise it works fine.
2,Why Would I Buy This Import When...,"....there's no track listings here? True, they were a good group, and most import CDs are nice, but, for me, there needs to be more of an incentive. Buy sight unseen only if you're a true fan. Rhino Records has made a few good AWB collections...."
1,Price seem to good to be true? IT IS!,"First off, anyone who has written a positive review for this TV probably wrote that review right after receiving it. If you are foolish enough to purchase this thing and not heed the warnings, wait a couple months before writing your review. I guarantee you that you won't have anything nice to say about it. The picture goes in and out on a weekly basis.My wife got in touch with customer service on the first call (amazing, considering what the other reviews said). They had her reset the TV, which didn't work. Their next solution was for us to call a service technician. A month after purchase and we need to call someone to look at it? Unbelievable!"
1,"RUN, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING APEX, NO MATTER WHAT!!!","Do not buy this, or anything else. tv broke after 3 weeks of limited use.(maybe 1 or two sittings a WEEK) amazon wouldn't take it back, and Apex took a MONTH to find a repair center, i live in Baltimore MD, a major metropolitan area! The repair center has it, going on 3 THREE months, still not repaired. Apex says ""oh, all we can do is repair it"", but obviously they dont. They are a rip off, do not buy from them, the picture was bad and the quality is even worse. Apex is good for a gag gift at best. Buy it if you want, i warned you. Good Luck."
3,Customer service is terrible!,"The t.v. is great except for some lines that go directly down the center of the screen while watching a dvd or playing a video game. The picture quality is great, but I only give it 3 stars because of the absolutley terrible customer service. They gave me the run-around for so long that my 90 warranty had expired before I could ever ger the t.v. repaired. I will not buy Apex products anymore because of their customer service."
1,STAY AWAY FROM APEX,"tis tv completely died within 3 weeks of owning it. now, 5 months later i still have not been able to get in touch with apex. HORRIBLE COMPANY, NO CUSTOMER SERVICE, STAY AWAY!!!"
4,Pokémon TCG for the GameBoy : REVIEWED,"A book worth having handy while playing the game, this guide to the long awaited 'Pokémon TCG for the GameBoy' has information on almost every card with even the tiniest details. With 226 cards to collect,8 gyms and 4 finalists to beat,people to find,people to beat and stratagies to plan this amazing book will help you all the way through your journey starting at Dr.Masons Lab (where you get your first deck(and finishing at the PokéDome (where you try and beat the final four). Also don't forget you'll still have to collect the 226 cards availible to you throughout the game, cards ranging from the rare Mew to the shocking Pikachu to the fire-blasting Charizard. These cards aren't easy to find though you'll only be able to get them by beating other trainers you meet along the way. Don't forget to look out for the 4 legendary cards only availible in the PokéDome after beating the Elite Four !"
2,Cute but the company is terrible,I bought these as a gift. One of the lids came chipped. Attempts to contact the company were never returned. They are very cute just wish i could have recieved a new lid.
4,Celtic Legacy,"This compilation fits in the category of haunting and beautiful, akin to Conversations With God. I use it for massage and background music in my home office. The various artists keep it interesting but the overall mellowness ranks it high in my books."
5,Razor replacement part,I bought this as a replacement part for the Braun electric shaver. Both are terrific.
5,Add this one to Your Library,"Mark Twain at his best...great pictures and annotation...that are first rate. Due to time restraints, I have only skimmed the book. What I have read is great. It is a Norton book...always-great editions. If weight means anything, then this is a heavy-duty book. I look forward to reading the entire book after graduation in the spring. In addition, it even looks good on the shelf...."
3,a good in school book but not a take home,"I had tyo read this book for english this year. Compared to some of the outher books I had to read it was very good, but outherwise it was marginal. I love learning about the civil war, so I would be lying if I said I wasn't dissiponted with this book"
2,Tasha's Rifles for Waite Review,"My mom made me read Rifles for Waite. I don't know why because I thought it was very boring. I usually like books like this but this was not one I enjoyed. I don't reconmend it to any 12-13 year old girl who has a weak stomach. It was very grafic. Although it was very informative, this book was not interesting."
2,I read this book for English this summer and Iwas displeased,"I did not care for this book at all. I thought it was one of those types of book that goes through one ear, and out the other. It was the type of that went into too much detail. The only chapters that I liked were the ones with Lucy Washborne in it. The chapters were drawn out, and I would not reconmend this book."
3,Derrick's Review!!!,"Rifles for Watie, by Harold Keith, is a book about a 16-year-old boy named Jeff Bussey and can't wait to leave his farm in Kansas to defend his Unionagainst the Indian leader of the Rebels(Stand Watie. As a soldier, Jeff has to walk hundreds of miles while watching his friends die in battle. He gets sent over to be aspy and if he gets coaght, they'll kill him. But it gets worse. He finds out that the rebels are fairly nice people and on top of that he falls in love with a rebel girl. To find out what hhe does, read Rifles for Watie.I thought this was a good book because it has a lot of suspence in it and it isn't boringI think people who love action and war should read this book because that is what it is, action and war."
5,A MUST READ BOOK!!!!!,"I am a very picky reader and this is by far the best book I have ever read! If you could only buy one book, read this! Vividly portrays what life was like for a boy during the civil war era. I stayed up all night reading this book because I couldn't put it down. Do something good for yourself, READ THIS BOOK!!!!"
4,Rifles For Watie,"Rifles for WatieRifles is written by Harold Keith. Rifles is an good made up story of the life of a solider during the Civil War. It reads fast and will decently fill you up with some CivilWar facts, but not too many. Jeff, our main character,r is a boy of 17 and joins up with the North after bushwhackers attack his home. Kansas, 1861 is the setting for this book and it covers all of the Civil War. Jeff has some trouble with his commanding officer. Good for kids 10 and up. If you want a good adventure story, this is the way to go."
5,Best Book!,"I only have a couple things to say. One, this is the best book I have ever read. I will probally read it 10 more times it is so good. Kieth describes his characters so fantasticly that it seems as if they were actual people. It is about a 16-year old named Jefferson Davis Bussey or Jeff who's family gets buswhacked. After that Jeff had had enough, wich sends him and his buddies to Fort Leavenworth to enlist in the Kansas Volunteers. First Jeff is in the Infrantry then the Calvary and then a general makes him and a comrade spies in the Confederate Army. He has to survive the war then pick, will he go back to his family or stay with his crush?"
1,bubbles and peeling,"I just bought this product a few days ago and I have nothing good to say about it. It goes on smooth and after it dries it looks like your nails have tiny bubbles all over them. Furthermore, by later in the day it was peeling back from the tips of my nails. Took it off and started over again the following day and got the same results. I used to use this product many years ago and I don't remember having so much trouble with it. I'll be tossing it in the garbage and continue shopping for something that is going to work properly."
3,Decent Product!,"Well This product is not the best I have ever tried, but it was a decent item. I noticed after using it that my nails started to peel layers from the tip of my nails, which caused them to be very thin. So it wasn't a total success for me."
5,Hard to turn off.,"Perfect Symmetry was my first experience with this kind of rock/metal, and I've listened to it for almost 11 years now. The music and the lyrical content of their music is timeless, it will still maintain it's relevance far in the future. I was so enthralled with Perfect Symmetry when I first heard it, and all these years later I still have to close my eyes when I hear At Fates Hands. I feel very lucky that I've gotten to listen to these guys for so many years, and I've managed to enjoy all of their different ""era's"". I deeply respect these guys for being so inventive and refreshing, even in the face of vast changes in their music or band members."
1,Don't Buy,"This is a terriable camara - do not buy.When i first started to play with this camara i popped in a 1GB SD card and recorded on to it. I thought cool feature.When it came time to record some family moments i popped in DVD-R and started to shot away. Things were going ok intill the power lvl started to go down, and i did what anyone else would do - plug it in.Apparently when you plug the power in to the camara when it is turned on - it restarts it. Which from reading other users posts - totally hoses the current DVD.Right now i can't get the thing to even open to get the disc out let alone read it. It just says no disc. This is only after an hour of use. Its Christmas weekend, and won't be able to get awhold of Samsung till tuesday.The downside is I can't get back to the store to return it.Like other users have said - i'm going to stick with DV tapes."
4,Not too shabby,"I read the reviews for this item, on this site, before I purchased it and reading the reviews you'll see their either great or terrible. From my expeience, I'm in the great category.Pros:- The menu options are easy to navigate.- Fits hand nicely.- Battery charges quickly.- PC software is easy to use.- SD Card slot is handy.- Descent zoom.- All DVD format types- Reversible screen (common yes, but I like it!)Cons:- Short battery life- If battery goes dead and causes cam corder to shutdown, the DVD currently being recorded to does not properly close. Upon restart, with fresh battery, the DVD will be unworkable meaning you just lost all your pre-battery recharge video.- Night mode isn't spectacular- No light accessory attachmentNow yeah, there are some issues but what doesn't have some issues? As long as you're mindful of the battery, you shouldn't have any problems... for me - this camcorder is worth the money."
3,early indications are not good...,"""In her later years Mead transformed herself into a Druid-priestess figure who invariably wore earth-toned dresses, a flowing cape and Hobbit-like shoes."" (Milton 16)However much I might be inclined to agree with her other assessments, I have to wonder about their value if glaring errors like this are in the text. Everybody knows that <i>Hobbits don't wear shoes</i>!"
1,Poor and biased Scholarship,"Ms Milton admits to her anger at humanistic psychology, so she attacks without understanding. She does not seem to grasp even some of the basic concepts of the people's work she denigrates. Maslow's hierarchy of needs is one example. I have spent a great deal pf time studding humanistic psychology and writings. I have had the pleasure of being trained in group therapy with Carl Rogers, and William Coulson as instructors. Any one who really studies these writers will see how bad a job Ms Milton did presenting them. She should have let her anger subside before she wrote the book. Her bias is extreme and obvious. So consider this when reading the book. No doubt Ms Milton will have a new career appearing on the conservative religious programs. I am sure Pat Robinson and Jerry Falwell have or will book her to speak out against the evils of humanistic psychology."
4,Review of Malpsychia,"The author captures very well the ambience of the `50s, `60s and `70s. She describes the extraordinary influence on American culture of such humanists as Rogers, Maslow, and Leary, documenting the harmful consequences of the drug culture that their idealism fostered and the hypocrisy that lay behind such spin-offs as the encounter movement and student revolutions. For anyone who has lived through this era, this is a good book to read.Too bad she chose such an abstruse title! Most of us never heard of the ""eupsychia"" it is intended to satirize."
2,This album Sucks pretty bad.,I have never listened to Nic before I bought this. Real mediocre 80s disco sound.
3,"This is an imagery tape, wasn't aware of this.",This tape is purely an inspirational tape with imagery and self hypnosis. I thought it was more informational when I purchased it. Would appreciate it if they had marketed it as such.
3,they break easily,"Using the 1/4 inch cutting box joints in 1/4"" thick walnut, the bit broke off at the juncture of the cutting part of the bit and the 1/2"" shaft after 14 cuts. I was using a Freud router mounted in my router table with an Incra jig spacing jig. Bit barely missed my head when it was popped up by the spinning router.Be careful using the smaller cutters."
2,Questionable Quality,"I bought this television and it broke in less than 90 days. The manufacturer has not been very helpful in sending someone out to repair it as stated in the warranty. After two weeks, I'm still waiting and have little confidence that this will be resolved soon.When the television worked properly, it had a nice picture and good sound but that doesn't mean much now that I can't even watch it.Do your homework - check the reputation of the manufacturer before you make your buying decision. Unfortunately, I didn't check until it was too late. This company has an unsatisfactory rating with the BBB for the very reasons that I've indicated."
1,Fried within 3 Months,"I'm normally not one to take the time out of my day to write a review for something but I feel that if my bad experience here might save just one person from blowing their money the time is well spent. Everything that everyone else has said about this being a piece of junk is true. I was fortunate enough to get less than three months out of it before the screen turned into an hour glass shape and the colors got screwed up. I called one of the ""service centers"" nearby and they said they were no longer dealing with APEX because they would not honor his service bills and parts took forever to come in if they did at all. I've talked to Apex numerous times when I finally get through to them and they also lie to me and will constantly try their hardest to hang up on me. I'm about two seconds from working to turn them into the BBB. There has to be some kind of consumer protection we can use."
1,Very Poor Writing,"I love all things Scottish, but not this book. The descriptions were bland and the diction was horrid - at one point Carlow's hero describes his feelings about his beloved's appearance - ""Her figure was wonderful."" What does that really mean? I have read much better books set in this time - try Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series, but avoid this book!"
3,Highland Desire,"I just finished reading this book, although there were quite a few mistakes, I found the book to keep me in suspence and hungry to find out what was going to happen next. But, I also found it to be too slow moving at times and I wanted to get to know the characters better. I will look for another book by this author to read!"
5,american pioneers,"i bought this on vinyl in the 80`s,and it still stands up to this day,i also bought it on cd,now this one has a dvd concert in it,i may have to buy this again.this disc is great,no doubt sabbath fans,trouble mixes sabbath groove with up tempo metal,this is a must buy, especially with a dvd concert attached.seeing a band live always gives you a perspective you can`t get from just listening to a cd,you may find yourself getting the rest of their cd`s."
2,Where oh where is that figure again....?,"This book, although covering all the basics, does it in a jumbled way. It teaches you about tags, which is great, but sometimes loses track, jumping from one topic to another in a seemingly random fashion. The most infuriating thing to me was the referencing of figures that never seemed to appear in the pages anywhere. I can't begin to explain how confusing it is for a person who sets out to learn something, when the ""example"" isn't there. Next time I'll buy from another publishing house. The proofreaders in this one just can't be bothered to be precise."
3,Too many code errors,"I am using this book (2nd edition) for a beginning HTML class that I am teaching. I was initially impressed with the book's coverage of XHTML. However, the book is loaded with code errors. This is unacceptable, especially for a 2nd edition!"
3,Useful Basket / Flimsy Liner,"This basket works well as a daytime sleep spot - you could even use it for nights in lieu of a bassinet.We skipped the version with the hood because we thought it looked a little silly, but in hindsight might have opted for the sun-shade for those daytime naps.The big downside we ran into was the way the liner fell apart after its first wash, despite following the instructions which indicate that machine washing is okay. Maybe if you hand wash it you'll have better luck.I'd have given this basket 5*s if it hadn't come with the flimsy liner."
3,a nice little basket,"I weave these baskets with ribbons and make blankets to match. They really are a great gift for a baby. But THIS basket was very small. Smaller than all the baby baskets that I have used in the past. I wondered why it was such a great deal, I believe the size is why the price is great. It is more like a doll basket, a baby could only use it for a matter of weeks. That is bad if you would put a lot of work into it and then possibly buy a stand to go along with the basket. But that aside, it is nice that the little mattress is included and the quality of the basket is good,, just so darn small."
4,Does the job!,"I purchased the Badger Basket for a safe, clean place to lay the baby down anywhere in the house or on visits to family or friends. The price was right. I didn't want to spend a fortune as it can only be used for a couple of months. It would make a nice baby gift as it looks lovely. After the baby outgrows it, it would make a nice toy basket. I only gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, because it is a little more flexible than I would like."
3,Basket is Nice -Tacky bedding,"The Moses Basket is fine - I am sure it will work well for the 3 or so months that the baby will sleep in it, however, the bedding - 'pink gingham bedding' is really cheesy and tacky. The fabric is a flimsy scratchy polyester which is poorly sewn. The little mattress is cheap and the sheet ill fitting and - again - the flimsy polyester. I felt that the bedding needed to be replaced so I am sewing new bedding and what a hassle since I am not an expert seamstress. I have spent hours making a mattress pad and sheet and now am working on the bumper pads. If I had just purchased a more expensive Moses Basket in the first place I am sure it would have come with better bedding."
3,weave was splintering,"The weave was splintering in several places, but you aren't supposed to use the handles with a baby in the basket anyway so it only affects appearance. The product I ordered was supposed to be espresso colored though, and the one I got was a dark green."
2,Too Small,I was scared to let my baby sleep in the basket at night b/c I was scared he would get pushed up against the sides. Good for napping though. Can't beat the price.
4,Perfect for our needs,"This moses basket arrived very quickly and was perfect for what we needed. I was looking for a basket for my sister to use with her newborn, and one that I could fill up with baby goodies for her baby shower. My only issue is that the padding around the sides must be tied on, so you have to continually situate it while tying them on to make sure that it is secure. Other than that, it is absolutely beautiful and I know she will love it!"
1,badger baket,"not that good the basket are so loose that breaks easily,I would rather spend extra dollar,and buy the good ones which is n't that expensive compare to this one."
2,Not Good Enough for Baby,"We really liked the idea of a basket for our son soon-to-be. But when we got this product, we just didn't feel comfortable with letting him sleep inside of it. It seems a bit flimsy to us, and it doesn't have a very well defined shape. Even so, the included foam mattress clearly doesn't fit well. That would have been ok, if we could have found one that did. But, try as we might, we couldn't find one on amazon. We tried theNaturepedic Organic Cotton Bassinet Oval Mattress, and it definitely is not a match! Finding fitted sheets was also hard on amazon. We are returning the item, though, so I can't report on whether they actually fit or not. In the end we opted for a much more expensive wicker bassinet set from another company."
2,Fell apart,"I like moses baskets, but this one had very gentle use and one section of it still unraveled. I would not purchase anything from Badger Baskets again."
4,Great basket,"I needed something I could put my infant in while I got ready in the bathroom or did the laundry. If you just need a quick place to put a baby, this is great. Looks good, has held him for months. Now I get to figure out what to do with a great, large basket once he outgrows it. Stuffed animals, maybe?"
3,WOW. This thing is HUGE!,This thing is MUCH bigger than I expected and I am still on the fence as to whether I will keep it...
3,Good for only one baby.,This tore up too quickly. My daughter had to throw it out after my grandson got too big for it.
5,A Bio that reads like a lush 'old-Hollywood' movie!,"This book is vivid with details and descriptions of Tamara's fascinating life. A sumptuous bite into the life of an artist; this story is simmered in vibrant retellings of Tamara's historical tribulations, her numerous tumultuous relationships (both male & female), her eccentricities along with an almost infamous ego, and the constant tribulations of trying to express oneself via pigment & canvas. Even if you are not currently familiar with Tamara's work (audible gasp) this book is guaranteed to enrich your view of artists and vibrant women alike."
5,A Fabulous Biography of a Fabulous Artist,"A long time Lempicka fan, I read Claridge's biography as part of the research for my master's thesis on the artist. This book provided so much information not only on events in Lempicka's life, but also her sexual habits and personal characteristics. I also found this book a great source on life in 1920s and 30s Paris. But be warned, this book does not provide many images of Lempicka's unique paintings, although many of the illustrations are full-color reproductions.This book reads easily and is entertaining as well as informative. I highly recommend it for Lempicka and Art Deco fans!"
4,Red Tea,"Patience pays off!I have been hunting for the perfect summer tea for me for an oolong time and so many times I've been let down. The Elizabeth Arden teas are good, not great imo. I wanted great.Then comes along Thé Rouge (Red Tea). Encouraged by a flurry of reviews & a forum post about figs elsewhere online, I bought it blind. I'm a spice & woods lover and I adore Bvlgari Omnia, so the buy was easy.It's an oriental lite with rooibos & yunnan teas, sweetened by fig. Thé Rouge is right up my alley. Summer fresh yet seasonless. Complex & deep yet light & airy. Unique & non-cliche. And it's pretty cheap! Lasting power is as expected for an EdC."
2,"More country rock, less shlock!","MG has always had that whiskey drinkin', barroom country edge to them and this album has none of that feeling to it. I wish they could put the same energy into an album that they had on the CMT Crossroads with Skynyrd. Songs like Hillbilly Shoes, Hell Yeah and My Town all had that energy that is missing on this album. I think the next time the boys go into the studio they should take a little extra Jim Beam with them and kick it up a few notches!"
1,SOME PEOPLE CHANGE IS THE ONLY GOOD SONG,"I don't understand why they didn't put this awesome, touching, and meaningful song on their greatest hits. The album is dull and full of filler tracks. Troy Gentry is good only for a back up singer. Please get him off of lead vocals. Definitely do not recommend this one.I tried to get into ""Clouds"" but the style of the song does nothing for me. The lyrics are fine; however as one reviewer said lyrics alone can not carry an album. These guys are done. I think the main song here will be their final hit. ""A Man's Job"" was very disappointing to me. I really thought this would be a good one. Again the lyrics are good; but the tune is not catchy.I recommend their greatest hits. They need more songs like ""She Don't Tell Me To"" and ""Speed.""YOU DO YOUR THING AND I'LL DO MINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Boycott Troy Gentry For Killing ""Cubby"" the black Bear",Do not buy this coward's(Troy Gentry) music. He killed a helpless animal that was unable to escape in a canned hunt. He does not deserve your support or money.He needs to go to prison for this crime.
1,Troy Gentry--Liar,"Legendary country songwriter Harlan Howard wrote that country music could be defined as ""three chords and the truth."" No matter what you think of Montgomery Gentry's work, when you buy this band's music, you are buying music made by a man who shot and killed a caged bear and lied about it. That's the action of a coward and an egotist and it makes everything he sings in any of his songs a lie. I'm sorry if you like their music, but Troy Gentry should be drummed out of the country music business. He is a shame to the very idea of country music."
4,Good Country Music!!,Really enjoy the songs that is on this album. I love Montgomery and Gentry it is real quality of music. Also the CD very good condition no problems at all.
3,"Less Gentry, more Montgomery please","I have always enjoyed the rockin country sound of this duo but I believe that Troy Gentry had way too many leads on this album. He's okay as a backup and that's where he needs to stay. Other than that it's a decent album, but not their best."
5,I liked this cd,just got this cd about 2 hrs ago and i like it its one for my collection! listened to it twice so far
5,Hometown Heros do it again..WOW,"Listen, I am from Lexington Kentucky, home of MG and even all of us local people who support our Hometown Heros no matter what, was surprised by this CD. It could NOT be any better. For sure, there best project yet! The song ""Clouds"" is the one everybody is talking about, really is the saddest song I have ever heard and I cried like a baby missing my recent loved ones lost.It's moving into my top 5 favorite cd's ever and I think you'd agree.Dont hestitate, if you are a MG fan, purshase this cd immediately, it's wonderful! We are crowd as a peacock in Kentucky!"
4,"On the Outside, Listening In","I must confess, when I first heard the title track, I was not overly impressed as I perceived it as a knock off of Faith Hill's, ""Breathe."" Later, after hearing the track, ""At the End of the Day,"" I knew I needed to buy this CD and listen, before completely dismissing it as ""pop/country fodder.""I was not disappointed, from the opening notes of ""Bluer Skies,"" that made me tap my toes and press the accelerater just a little harder, to the haunting melancholy of ""Outside Looking In,"" that brought tears to my eyes--this ""poppish"" mix of music was a mix that would do well in mainstream air play.I would recommmend this compilation for those who like artists such as Martina McBride, Kathy Mattea, Celine Dion and Patty Loveless. If you are a country purist, this definitely is not your glass of sweet tea."
5,Fantastic,"I don't usually like country music but this album, ALL of the songs are fantastic - A must for everyone!"
5,kellie Coffey -----REAL TO LIFE,"You could feel the power of her voice and song writing in this song. She is not trying to be like someone, just herself and that is great. This is one of those songs that stay with you forever. I just listen to it over and over."
3,Just a Few Good Songs,"I love ""When you Lie Next to Me"" and ""At the End of the Day,"" but none of the other songs on this album stand out to me. Kelly has a gutteral sound to her voice that I'm not very fond of in any singer. It takes away from the power in her voice and the purity of it as well."
1,Buy an Emmylou Harris cd instead...,"Can someone explain to me why this is country music? It's 99.5% Celine Dion-esque fluff pop and 0.5% country. That 0.5% is once again the appearence of a steel guitar (always used in an uninteresting way on things like this). It seems that anybody who wants to test the commercial waters of ""country music"" just tacks on the rudementary steel guitar topping so it can earn the name-yet they never seem to notice that the spirit's not there. This is a pop release sold as country because of the possiblity of huge sales-nothing more. The steel guitar AND country music fans deserve more than this."
5,What a debut*,"Kellie's debut CD is nothing short of amazing. If you like ""When you lie next to me"", you will love the rest of this CD. There is a good mix of slow ballads and upbeat songs. The duet with Lonestar, ""Outside Looking In"" is about a relationship that doesn't seem to be filled with love, even though it may look so from the outside. This song is great and Lonestar's vocals help it out. My favorite song is ""Why Wyoming"", which is about a lost love leaving and wondering what you couldn't offer him. ""Bluer Skies"" is an upbeat song about chasing dreams. All of these songs are priceless and Kellie's emotion sparkles the lyrics! I would definately buy her CD. All songs could be singles."
4,A new sound in Nashville that's getting attention...,"I first saw Kellie Coffey on her ""When You Lie Next to Me"" video on CMT. The song was great!!! Her voice is a bit different (Oklahoma) and she comes across as genuine in her first album. I hope she gets more notice in the near future."
3,"Didn't work, but...","This stuff failed to keep our dog from licking his wound. Totally failed. However, we found out a few days later that the wound wasn't just a wound, it was a cuterebra (botfly) larva, which maybe nothing would have kept the dog from worrying at."
4,"So far, so good","My basset finds it entertaining to chew on anything and everything. I just bought new leather shag area rugs, and these have become his new chew toys. As soon as I got this bottle, I tested it on one of the loose leather strands. It did not change the color, so I sprayed the entire rug. He tried chewing on it, but didn't like the bitter flavor. He has left them alone since. The only thing I do not like about the spray is it burns my lungs when I spray it."
2,Works... Temporarily,"Bought this to stop a four month old border collie puppy from chewing on wires and furniture. It worked at first, but my puppy quickly began to ignore it and kept on chewing, even after repeat applications. I guess if he wasn't teething and determined to chew on everything to relieve the discomfort it might work."
3,It's alright ...,"I guess i have a super hyper puppy and she keep on chewing on everything in the house, I purchased this item and decided to give it a try. However, this spray has a strong scent and it scared my puppy away when i first applied it on my slipper, but it seemed not last long enough that my puppy kept chewing on my slipper after 30 mins. I would say this item works only when you apply it within the first 5-10 mins, once the smell fade away, you will have to re-apply it often enought in order to prevent puppy for chewing..."
2,Not good condition,The book conditions was not as the conditions the seller specifically said it was. It was not a paperpack book. As a result pages can get detached of the pile very easy.
4,entertaining but not essential,"I thought about giving this only 3 stars, maybe 3.5 would be closer to what I think, but I'm going with 4 stars just because I love Blue Note compilations so much. I'm not crazy about every track --- there a few snoozers on here, but overall this is another fun collection of tunes inspired by movie themes from the 60s and 70s. All the tracks on here were recorded during that era, too, the one exception being ""Down Here on the Ground"" in which Diane Reeves stuck her vocals in 1996 on a much older Grant Green track. There are also vocals from Nancy Wilson and Marlena Shaw, but the rest of the album consists of instrumentals, some slow and mellow, others upbeat and funky. Frankly, I found the mix of styles on here more annoying than pleasing, but then again it shows the diversity of artists that were recording for Blue Note at the time."
1,2 burned out picture tubes!!,Two bad tubes within 25 months. Panasonic and Sears washed their hands clean on the second time saying the 2 year tube warranty start from original date of purchase. I will never buy Panasonic again. I had a Sony that would not quit after 20 years. All Sears can say is you should have bought the extended warranty. Never again!!!
1,Venezuelan Muzak,"This is not a good introduction to Venezuelan music, but rather, a keyboard-ridden collection of old classics. It feels too much like getting stuck in an elevator to be enjoyable. And that is a shame, since it covers some of the best Venezuelan folk tunes in the canon"
4,Great content,This book is really good. It's recommended for people who want to understand basics of Calculus. Everything gets demonstrated. For Self-taught. I would rather recommend to rewrite the book. It seems to be scanned.
1,Unreadable on Kindle,"The book is unreadable on a Kindle. The symbols for the Greek letters, integral symbols, super/subscripts, etc., are converted to gibberish in the Kindle edition. This is unforgivable in such a book. I have to believe that the positive reviews here were from the hard copy edition."
3,Dated and verbose,"Writing about analysis has come a long way since the days of Hardy. There are a number of modern books on the topic with clear, vigorous prose that is lacking in Hardy and provide better coverage. But to be fair, mathematics is a developing endeavor and you'd expect improvements during 100 years. Mostly a curiosity. I believe you can read it online for free."
3,Thinker and knower--Who knew?,"Nancy ""B""'s insight into our'thinker' mind holding us back and our 'knower' mind urging us to go with our gut has the ring of truth. It's an eye opener with a powerful motivational message."
1,Unhappy,"Thanks AmazonI spent $35 buying this wonderful Wallander DVD, only to find that it is in the US format and cannot be played in Australia.Thanks Heaps"
3,Good,This was good but not one of my favorites. The main character is kind of depressing. It's worth the watch as long as you are not in a down mood.
2,Sweden is not this depressing,"I had high hopes for these three videos, having read the books. The camera work is truly beautiful. But they are way on the depressing side, and Kenneth Branagh, an actor I enjoy and respect, has decided to play Wallander as a kind of caricature, a sleepwalking incompetent whose bad decisions get people killed, or almost killed, in the case of his daughter (whose every line, it seems, begins with ""Oh Daddy. . .""). How do characters like Wallander and House achieve one- or two-day-old beard stubble every day of the week? The way Wallander is played here, you think that perhaps if he got one week's worth of good sleep, his IQ would rise by perhaps 20 points and he could solve his cases much faster. In my opinion, if you haven't read the books you will have a hard time following some parts of the videos, because so many details have been left out. I so wish I could watch the Swedish versions of these."
2,"Warning, Kenneth Branagh ahead. Ripe ham alert!","Based on the wonderful Henning Mankell stories this series could have been really good. It is NOT awful and certainly watchable. The production values are high and the cast(including Kenny) are fine actors. The problem is watching Ken Branagh be a great artist is just so painful.The Wallander character is a tragic burnt out wreck with all kind of issues dealing with his daughter, ex-wife, father and the bottle. The problem with this tv series vs the books is that too much screen time is spent beating you over the head with Wallander's suffering. The storylines and the mystery itself are secondary to almost endless footage of Wallander suffering and being confused. There is almost no time spent on the actual detecting of the crime or the other characters situation in life. So you have Kenneth Branagh hy-jacking the plot with mega suffering scenes."
2,"Very disappointing, compared to the books","Sorry, I can't agree with most of the sunny reviews, having the read the books ahead of time. I love Mankell's writing for the atmosphere and character development, and distilling the books to an hour of video each simply leads to disappointment - it's like watching a full-length movie on fast-forward. If you liked the books, skip these."
5,A Cop show for grown ups!,"What a pleasure this series is to watch. An intelligent, somber, complex 'cop show' which will be appreciated by anyone who enjoys substance over flash. Wallender, (Kenneth Brannah) is a swedish police detective (with a very british accent as do all the characters) who is a burned-out, near break down, and very good at solving crimes. What sets this show apart is that the 3 episodes covered are unique and not the typical type you'd see on an 'American' cop show. I can't wait for the next installment of this series."
1,"Apex is a bad product, the worst I have know","This is based on my experiences with a apex 65hdtv I purchased this year and what the service people came to my house to fix the problems said.The services from the apex company is terrible. They can have you waited on phone for hours and each time you call they ask you for all the info again and never return your call.According to the service man came to my house to fix my apex tv, apex is one of the worst product he has even seen and not recommend me to buy it again."
3,"Big, Inexpensive Masonic Flag!","Big, nylon Masonic flag, in blue. Has two metal grommets on the right side. Large, came un-damaged. Satisfied. It will come with folding lines, and I don't know how to get them out. I wouldn't want to iron it (probably melt the nylon). That's why 3-stars."
4,Original Game:Inerview with a School Player,"We saw this Man on a Court Tv show and he caught our interest so we ordered the book....WOW.....very interesting, but tends to be a learning manual even though he says it's not. Brings light to the underworld big time. Somewhat scary but very interesting reading."
1,Original Lame,"I heard so much about this guy so I brought his book. I have seen guys like him growing up and most of the time they are living from day to day because those hustles he talks about don't bring in a lot of money. He talks about being a big time pimp but goes to another city and then has to ask another pimp for money because he is broke. That alone proves that he was not the pimp or player he claims to be.So much for cross country pimping.This guy was just a petty thief who tries to come across like he is some mob type of guy. He should take himself to players for being a petty theif impersonationg a player.I would recommend any book written by Tariq Nasheed over this garbage that Darryel A. Woodson claims as knowledge. If you want to learn how to be a homeless, broke, and petty thief buy this book.Mr. Woodson where do file the papers to send you to players court?"
5,Astonishing !,"Original Game: Interview with an Old School Player has to be the greatest book of its kind. Once I received my package, I was thrilled to know that my book has arrived. As I read from page one to the last (Yes, I finished the book in one sitting it was that GOOD)I was impressed by the detailed description of the ""game"" explained by The Original White Folks. I won't give to much in depth details of the book, but I can assure you that when you read the book you will be blown away by his charismatic and witty ways. A true Player who holds nothing back, you may even have a few laughs at his commentary of the game as you start to understand his world. Great man with a lot of knowledge on his belt. THIS BOOK IS WORTH IT, BUY IT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."
5,"Beyonce Is Garbage, Janet Is Perfect Star",I Love U I Want You To AksJust A Little While Is GreatI Want You Is Wonderfull
5,The True Queen of Pop,"'Damita Jo' is truly a creative reflection of Janet's life for all to experience. This album is a journey that takes you from point A to point Z without missing a beat. I'm glad that her life is full of love and happiness because it truly shows in this project. Loads of soul, R&B;, pop and sexy ballads that reflect that Janet is, was and always will be the true Queen of Pop. Her live shows are electric and will no doubt translate this album into a spectacular visual montage of creative genius.You Go Girl...show Britney and J-Lo how it should be done!"
5,Strawberry Bounce,"I love this CD. I heard it was a different side of Janet, and it kind of is. It is still sexy, still has ballads and dance tracks, but like all Janet records you can tell she is in a different stage of her life. The highlights on this LP for me were Damita Jo which has a catchy beat like Strawberry Bounce, My Baby ft. Kanye West, All night long, and my favorite track has to be Just a Little while.This Cd is a great CD for Janet fans, and even if you aren't there is something for you on this CD."
5,"Wonderfully Done, Tasteful, and Ecclectic","This is a wonderful album, another one added to Janet's list of masterpiece albums. After looking at the past few albums, I must say that Janet has grown a lot. This album is an ecclectic and diverse one for Janet. Most of all, it is different for us fans. However, we can handle it. I am pleased with Janet's musical taste, it is open and filled with many themes that touch the inner soul of all listeners. I am happy for Janet and Jermaine. Although most people do not approve of her and Jermaine, it does not matter because Miss Jackson is going to continue to do her thing regardless of what people say. YOU GO JANET!!! Cannot wait to see you when you come to New Orleans.Much Love,Anthony Sharp"
4,JANET IS BACK,Janet is back. This cd is the janet we all know and love. She is back happy and in love. Buy it!
2,Who would of thought?,I am used to Janet having cd's with allot of tracks. I just think I have had enough of a bunch of album fillers. She stopped making good CD's a long time ago. I think she lost that spark she used to have its just not there anymore. THough I do like the 2 tracks she released. Since that is where it stops. Thats where my review will stop.
2,Nothing much,"With "" The Velvet Rope "" Janet Jackson offered one of the most witty , rich soul albums of that year while "" All For You "" was full of the shiny confidence of a woman who knows she is on top form . With "" Damita Jo "" our modern rnb queen has chosen for some reason to compete with the likes of Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears even though her past work is so many cuts above than any of their releases . It's always difficult to understand the heart let alone the mind of a modern female artist i guess but songs like "" Warmth "" and "" Moist "" can only dissapoint and offer nothing positive to her discography or image ."
4,Would have given it 5 stars but . . .,"Not since the VELVET ROPE has Janet come out with a cohesive powerful album. She got really close this time around. With the exception of ""Just A Little While"", the album is funky and sensual. (I HATE ""Just A Little While"" and is such an unJANET song in my opinion. What the hell was she thinking putting it on her album and then having it be the first release?! She should have come out with ""All Night"" first"". That song is soooo Damita Jo and I'm sure the first weeks' record sales would have been greater.)For the most part this album is a dance album as Janet said it would be. (Just skip over ""Just A Little While"" . . . please.) Hopefully Madonna records a dance album soon also. But that's another story."
1,What is Happening To The Jacksons?,"I have been sorely dissapointed by this latest CD from Janet Jackson. The songs are far from jamming and nothing really stirs me. She sings in some sort of whisper or purr throughout the entire CD attempting to still be sexy. Wasn't the flash enough to convince America everything still works. I would much prefer a grove with a dance number to match than a whimpering sigh about nothing. What is happening to the talent in this family? Don't waste your money on this one, sorry Miss Jackson!!"
1,Just not good enough!,"There's honestly nothing about this cd I like.It to me Is overblown hype.I listened to It once but haven't been able to listen any more,and I have really tried.I hope Janet's next effort Is better."
3,ok album,"not janet's best album, but worth it for Island Life, All Nite(Don't Stop), Thinking Bout My Ex, I Want You, Like You Don't Love Me, Moist(musically). Musically she's a winner, but lyrically she comes off as a bit too graphic, which is unnecessary for someone like her. (...)"
1,Bad Bad Bad,This Cd is terrible. Is this really a Janet Jackson CD???It's so bad and I love Janet Jackson. I just hope she gets back into the studios and makes another CD real soon. What a let down.
1,Hot garbage,"Looked at a lot of these 5-star reviews...they must be employees of the record company. This CD is forgettable. Perhaps it will grow on me, perhaps Janet will make some bangin' videos to some of the singles, because after all, she is an 'entertainer' (her strentgh) vs. a 'singer' (her weakness)...Truth be told, we expect more from this Jackson. If it was LaToya or Tito we would just shrug our shoulders and just say 'oh well, t'was to be expected', but from Janet, and from a CD this hyped before the release...What has happened to music these days is not the fault of Napster and downloading MP3's. The quality of the music is just not there anymore. It's not just Janet. But this CD is a good example of sizzle pop with no substance."
1,KKHW,Can she ever sing about anything else?Singing about sex all the time gets redunant after awhile and it is my experience that those who chat about sex constantly aren't all that great in the first place.
1,"I agree, all you fans are in denial","Okay, there are a few good tracks on this album? What I can't hear them. I must be stupid. What is this, some sort of curse where people beleive this crap and whispery sh** is ""music""? Wow. And I agree with that one person who said those fans are in denial. I AGREE, YOU ARE ALL IN DENIAL!"
3,Nothing great here,"I watched her music video for All Night, and thought the song was just excellent--catchy,interesting and somewhat mysterious. It's too bad the rest of her CD doesn't match this single. Basically, her songs all start to sound the same and nothing really stands out. It's a challenge to actually listen to the entire CD. NOT WORTH BUYING."
1,What the @$%&,I went to sleep on track three (out of 20+). I want old school Janet back. This CD is not worth the $9.00 I spent to buy it. I would have rather paid to see Janet said on a coke bottle for 2 hours! This is the perfect CD for someone who wants to commit suicide in the upcoming future. VERY DEPRESSING!!!!!
1,No 15 and on its way down,"Damito Jo is now no. 15 on the Billboard album chart! Thank you! To all of you who refused to be suckered by the wardrobe/musical/career malfunction, thank you. It is great to see that most of the CD buying public wised up to the fact that 90% or more of the wonderful reviews here were written by record company hacks wanting to make you believe that there was some grassroots fan movement. Let's keep it going until Damita Jo is in the cutout section and on sale for $1.99. And even then, don't buy it!"
2,"Janet's Album, Not On Target.","I've always liked Janet's albums and her lyrics pertaining to all the songs she writes. However, ""Damita Jo"" is not nearly as good as her 2001 hit, ""All For You"". You sometimes wonder where Janet is going with her music. These songs don't have the feel or the arrangements that the Janet Jackson we all know and love for many years. Janet needs a break for two years from the studio and concentrate on a monster hit in 2006."
3,worth it for the good songs,"R&B junkie is my favourite song on this album, despite being heavily sampled. I Want You, Just a Little While are also extremely catchy, and All Nite Don't Stop has an infectious beat. Moist is has very pretty and soothing music, and Damita Jo has a fun hip hop vibe. The album is far from janet's best work, but definitely worth it for the strong tracks I mentioned"
4,"Not my favorite Janet album, but still a great record","I love janet's comeback. the unfortuante incident with the superbowl not withstanding, her newest cd rocks. perhaps not equatable with janet. or rhythm nation but there are still some decent trax to be found. loved R&B Junkie and All Nite. and Just a Little While reminds of the fun, saucy janet who loves to have fun. you should definitely buy this album!"
5,"SEXY, AND I WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY","People need to get over it. The innocent Janet of the 1980s is gone, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Control and Rhythm Nation 1814 were excellent, but Damita Jo is rising the charts fast. I LOVE All Nite (Don't Stop)! I saw her perform it on Saturday Night Live, and now, 2 days later, I bought the album. It's great! Better than All For You, which was a great one anyways. It matches The Velvet Rope I think, in terms off ""good""ness. But janet. is still her best ever! I strongly reccomend this album though! It's hot!hot!hot!"
5,Janet is quality.... always,Janet's new CD continues to add to her depth in the music industry. With each album you learn more about her as a person and she is being allowed more freedom to express herself openly!! I can't wait for the concert!!
5,"""Nothing better than...","...spending time with you."" What a spectacular creation! Janet always is so creative and ""Damita Jo"" exemplifies the center of her many layers. It's so refreshing to know an artist can be so expressive- and be perceived in so many different ways, like every song on ""Damita Jo"". Allow yourself to journey into Janet's vulnerability of every lyric that lies within and share the development of this lady who will always remain in ""Control""."
4,refreshingly contemporary,"Certainly the singles that are out right now don't push the album very well because any one of the other songs could have been a better choice, ""My Baby"" should be the next single...that song, along with ""all nite"" ""like you dont love me"" ""Moist"" and ""truly"" make the album a worthwhile purchase...but actually the entire cd is very well arranged and produced as usual...very contemporay and abreast (err...no pun...), great CD though...no skips at all but maybe the damn interludes....her speaking voice isnt as refreshing and pleasant as that with which she sings....and she sounds like her brother a lot.......i was surprised about the grammy noms but then again it shouldnt be such a surprise music sucks these days."
3,Bonus tracks help a lot !!!!,"I have the 2 Damita Jo versions and I must say that the 2 bonus tracks raise the quality of her last work. Well, it is not a bad album, but it is kind of ""dull"" and repetitive. Technically the album is really well done, but it doesn't have the same energy or power than the others (janet, Velvet Rope). She manages to use perfectly different styles: Hip hop, Rock, R&B;, Dance... but it still has less energy, less powerful lyrics... AND I think we all already know that she LOVES sex...""I'm here"" (very R&B;) and ""Put your hands on"" (dancing...) are really good and should have been on the original album. My favorite songs are ""Sexhibition"" (unfortunately too short) ""R&B; Junkie"", ""All nite"", ""Put your hands on"": the catchy songs & ""Spending time with you"" and ""I'm here"".I regret that the ""Country interlude"" is not a song :(I am a huge fan of Miss Janet, but this album is not her best."
4,Damita Jo...A Different Side of JJ,"Damita Jo has a different flavor. I am a long-time Janet fan. She is a tremendously talented artist. When I first listened to the Damita Jo CD, I didn't like it, but after a while I really got into the music. My favorite cuts are Like You Don't Love Me, My Baby, Thinkin' Bout My Ex, and Island Life. I was surprised that JJ chose to work with additional producers than Jam & Lewis. I love the Babyface song, Thinkin' Bout My Ex. This is a great CD, but it's unfortunate that the album didn't receive good reviews. I think the record company failed to market the album as they should have after the Super Bowl incident. I'll always be a JJ fan. I hope that she continues to make beautiful music. its a good idea to purchase this album now, because I've heard rumors that a new version will be re-released in Sept 2005 with 6 new songs. Hope you enjoy the CD!!"
5,Simply Amazing,"Janet is back, and better than ever!! I personally enjoy each and every one of her albums; from Control to janet.; from Nation to Rope. She is by far the top singer/entertainer in the music industry. She always keeps her music sounding fresh and current, and always gives insight into her true self. On Damita Jo, Janet discusses the different characters that live inside every one of us. The album's interludes are spoken monologues, where Janet discusses various things about her life. Some of the best songs on the album are ""Just a Little While,"" ""Damita Jo,"" ""R&B Junkie,"" and ""Island Life"". Buy this album! You won't be disappointed!"
3,"at first i hated it, now i think it's ok","janet jackson's ""Damita Jo"" shows she's quite a sex-addict and she's cool with it, but it seems she's trying so hard to ""keep it real"" that she sounds quite corny and out of place. Her voice is quite relaxing, and some of the songs are really good. The interludes are an absolute yawn, though. She writes them with 2 other guys, and they're about 40 seconds long! Here are my ratings for the songs (not interludes/introductions/outroductions though):Damita Jo~Four StarsSexhibition~One StarStrawberry Bounce~Three StarsMy Baby~Four and three quarter stars*Spending Time With You~Five Stars*Island Life~Four StarsAll Nite (Don't Stop)~Two StarsR & B Junkie~Four StarsI Want You~One StarLike You Don't Love Me~Five Stars*Thinkin' 'Bout My Ex~Five Stars*Warmth~Two StarsMoist~Three StarsTruly~Three StarsSlolove~Three StarsJust A Little While~Two StarsThe singles are/will be: ""Just A Little While"" ""All Nite (Don't Stop"" ""I Want You"" ""Damita Jo"" and ""My Baby""."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST OVERHYPED OVERRATED RELEASES OF THIS YEAR.ONE OF HER WORST ALBUMS.AVOID THIS LOUSY .NO STARS
2,I'm sorry Ms Jackson,"this is defenetily the worst album from Janet. i can't believe she did this. first single Just a little while sounds like a tryout song for a 15 year old wannabe-pop star . after all the superbowl incident she tought it was going to be helpfull to the sales of Damita Jo, wich are a little bad for the sales she is used to... the album is falling down quickly on the charts... to bad it happened this to the ""ICON""..........."
2,boring,"I listened to this album the other day. One word: Boring. It's all sex no substance. Miss Jackson If You Nasty no more now it's more ""I'm Janet so I am nasty"" and nasty it is.(...)Sex is the only topic, and it's old and tired. Sex was the topic on the last one too and the one before that and even the one before that. With this one it feels like Miss Janet Jackson has made the same album for the 4th time in a row."
4,better than i'd hoped,"after the controversy of the superbowl and the poor performance of the initial two singles i was fearing that my favorite diva had slipped irretrievably into a creative slump; however, there is a refreshing honesty on this album that is very endearing. the songs have a variety that keeps them interesting, and it's impressive how complicated some of the musical structures are: multi-layered chords, understated themes, and energetic rhythms combine to create a unique sound environment that doesn't sound like anything else that's out right now. i hope the album fares better once it receives wider distribution. if you liked janet's past work you will enjoy this album; however, it isn't going to win her many new fans."
5,Damita Jo... 3 words FAB-U-LOUS!,"As any Janet fan knows, the anticipation behind Janet's newest creation ""Damita Jo"" will define this diva's strong hold on pop/r&b culture. Janet aims to please with Damita Jo and does much more than that. This album offers a variety of sulrty ballads, slammin' dance tunes and the R&B groove Janet was known for back in the ""janet"" days. Janet shines on every track. The tracks ""Sexhibition"", ""All Nite"", ""R&B Junkie"" and ""Slolove"" are all hipnotic house/funk/dance tracks that make your body wanna instantly bump and grind on the dance floor. You just don't hear these songs, you feel them. ""Damita Jo"", ""My Baby"" and ""Like you don't love me"" all bring our Sista Janet back into that funk and R&B groove. Work it Miss J! Her slow jams... all I gotta say is turn down the lights and get busy! One of her best works yet!"
2,Same ole song,"The music is what helps her career because you cant understand the words that are coming out of her mouth. There is nothing new here and the same ole terms should be retired. We know that ""she cant wait"", ""come here boy"" etc etc. She need to be classy and not what she considers ""naughty""."
2,Not worth the money,"I am a big Janet Jackson fan but I have to say this CD was a disappointment to say the least. I'm glad Janet has let loose of her inner demons and feels free to express her personality. This was done to perfection in Janet and later in the Velvet Rope CD and to a lesser extent All For You.Now it just sounds dull. Who knew sex could be so boring. Her whole sound on this CD is one of whispers and moans. I wish there were lyrics along with the liner notes so at least I could understand what she is saying. And here's a note for future CD's Janet, cut the intros. They've more than worn out there welcome.On the positive side a couple of tracks are some of her best unfortunately, they did not receive the airplay they deserved. Just A Little While and All Nite(Don't Stop) and My Baby is so-so. Download these singles and skip the CD."
1,Sorry!,"As a big fan of Janet I was looking forward to her new cd especially because i love her song ""just a little while"". But after listening to the cd i was so disappointed! There is just trash on it! Don't buy!Sorry Janet but I hope that your next one will be as good as your last cd's."
1,"if i could rate it zero stars, believe me, i would..","no doubt janet's peak was her FIRST name entitled album 'janet', which every song there was great. in this case, i tried very hard (very!) to find something worth listening to. i could'nt find anything. this album is pure waste of time, garbage to the ears and the worst unsexy sighs i've ever heard. don't waste your time."
2,What A Disappointment!,"I love Janet and have followed her since Control. However, this was such a disappointment for the dance community. The only song I honestly liked is All Nite (performed on Good Morning American and Ryan Seacrest). Of course, additional programming came from Sweden for this production. Sweden is so far ahead of the US with regards to quality dance beats. Something that I could also do without is all the short intro messages. Janet has BEEN THERE DONE THAT. I'm still a fan but hopeful for better material to come."
3,Don't try so hard!,"Janet Jackson tries to sound sexy on this cd but to me it comes off like she is whispering. Some of the songs you can hardly understand what she is singing about, I had to play the cd over and over before I could figure out the words. There are only a couple of songs worth mentioning. ""Thinkin' bout my ex"" is beautifully written and sung, ""All night"" and ""R&B junkie"" will have you dancing just like the old school days. Janet has nothing to prove to her fans.....but this cd is not her best."
4,This is an album worth buying,"This album from Janet entitled ""Damita Jo"" is a very good CD that is worth buying. The beats on this CD are more funkier than her previous albums. This album is more of a R&B album rather than her ""All For You"" album. My Favorite songs are ""Sexhibition"", ""Spending Time With You"", ""All Nite (Don't Stop)"" and ""I Want You"". I think Janet went wrong with the song ""Just For A Little While"" which is like a Bubble Gum pop song which I do not like, but thankfully its at the end of the album and I can turn it off at track 21 instead of going thru with track 22. But besides that this is one of her best. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!"
3,"3.5 stars. Strong start, but fades fast at the end.","I think this album is a step above ""All For You"" but you can't help but long for the Janet who song about social issues and real love (...). I only own ""Control"" ""Rhythm Nation,"" ""Janet,"" and ""The Velvet Rope"" which show Janet's true classic hits.While ""Damita Jo"" isn't a bad album, there are some duds: like the interludes and maybe two or three songs that could have been cut. However there are some good cuts like ""Spending Time With You,"" ""Damita Jo,"" ""Strawberry Bounce"" ""All Nite"" and ""R&B; Junkie"" just to name a few. Overall, 3.5 stars."
3,Janet could do better....,"I know janet could do better. This is the worst, plus all the good songs are like 2 minutes. WTF ! Janet you can do better, get rid of the interludes, and do not lead off your new cd with weak a@@ cuts. I think this CD will be off the charts before we know it. Kinda sad, being she will do a concert at the end of summer. By then the cd will no longer be in the top 50, as it's been only 6 weeks,and it's already at number 35. Sad, because she was on every TV show. Just not not a good CD. Maybe they should come out with remix of this CD, and then add like 5 new good songs...Still a fan but this is not a good CD."
3,ditch the interludes please!,"some of the interludes on this CD are janet's worst ever, she sounds so annoying rather than sexy, smart of poetic. They worked on the rhythm nation, janet and velvet rope albums though, but not here. As for the CD, standout tracks are All Nite(Don't Stop), r&b junkie, like you don't love me, just a little while, thinkin bout my ex, island life, spending time with you, moist. The rest is just your everyday r&b/hip hop sounding tunes, nothing really special, sounds like everything else out there today. So if you want it, buy this but don't come crying if it's not like another velvet rope to you."
3,"JANET IS THE BEST, BUT NOT THIS ALBUM.","Hi i'm a spanish fan of janet, i love her music and specially the albums janet and the velvet rope. i think Damita jo has a elegant sound, a good production but the album is so...ballad??, i think janet has the same error that beyonce with dangeously in love,what a boring CD. the first single ''just a little while'' is terrible and the video-clip...no comment, but songs like ''i want you'' and ''slolove'' can make the album a hit, we must think that janet could make an album better than Damita Jo or songs like ''got till it's gone'' in conclusion janet is the best female artist and has 65 millions records sold, a bad album can't change this."
3,buy it just for All nite(Don't Stop) alone,PLEEEEASE!!! I BEG YOU!!!! HELP JANET!!!!! THIS SONG IS THE SUMMER JAM OF THE YEAR!!!! WHERE'S THE JUSTICE???
3,Average,"""DAMITA JO"" has a few highs and lows. The best songs are ""Damita Jo"", ""Exhibition"", and ""I Want You"". There are a few other notable songs, but I think these three stand out. I personally don't care for the interludes, I think some are really silly and make the album seem somewhat boring. Some of the songs for me were just a bit on the silly side such as ""R&B Junkie"". It is by no means a terrible album, nor by any a great one, so I give it 3 stars for being average."
5,JANET ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"JANET ROCK ON THIS ALBUM... OUT OF 22 SONGS I LIKE OVER 18 SONGS ON THIS ALBUM..IF YOU LIKE THE JANET ALBUM THEN YOU WILL LOVE DAMITA JO... IF YOU LOVE TO DANCE DIFFERENTLY GET THIS ALBUM...(ALL NITE, R&B JUNKIE IS REALLY NICE..MY FAVORITE SONG IS ISLAND LIFE..GREAT SUMMERTIME HIT THERE..SLOLOVE IS GROOVY..I CANT STOP PLAYING IT**THUMBS UP"
4,Way To Go Ms Jackson,"This album is a triumph. Working with a variety of producers truly paid off for Ms Jackson. Noteworty songs include: ""My Baby"" featuring Kanye West, ""Like You Don't Love Me"", ""Island Life"", ""R&B Junkie"" and ""Slo Love"".This is her best piece of work since ""The Velvet Rope""."
5,Janet Still Holding It Down,Miss Jackson is still holding it down with her new album. While there are some great love/slow songs there are also songs that within the first couple of seconds you already want to get up and groove. Sweet beats and of course spectacular vocals! Number 10 is likely to be a club hit! GO BUY IT!!
1,HORRIBLE,"Let's talk seriously. This is a VERY BAD album, and I realize that a lot of janet fans just can't confess it because they simply like their idol (I just hate people who idolize enterteiners and think it's dramatic when the idolized entertainers have weak voices, bad interpretations and absolutely not creative musical projects), but the songs are horrible. The lyrics for Just a Little While are disgusting, she can't play with sexuality like Madonna in Justify My Love or Erotica ... . The songs sound more bubble-gummy than in her 2 first albums, it's not mature, it doesn't have personality. ... If you wanna listen to some more or less interesting Janet songs, go and buy The Velvet Rope, ..."
2,Bland and boring,"Remember when Janet Jackson actually used to *sing* on her CDs? With words you could make out and sing along to? (""Come on baby, let's get away/ save our troubles for another day..."") I've been a huge Janet fan since the late 80s and have loved most of the stuff she's done in the last 15 years.Unfortunately, on this CD, Janet has continued the sad trend she began with ""All for You"" -- she almost never SINGS. Instead, we get seductive lyrical whispers on nearly every track. There are only 2 or 3 songs on the entire CD that I could actually hear what she was saying without having to look the lyrics up.Some of the songs on this CD have a lot of promise... a few have really great beats that really make you want to dance, and they could be gold with another artist like Beyonce, who isn't afraid to use their voice. But honestly, unless you're a hardcore fan, I would skip ""Damita Jo."""
2,The extra star is being generous,"I don't care what you say, this is just not Janet Jackson. It's not a good CD and I would prefer to just pretend that she didn't make this. I don't care that the music is primarily about sex--at least make it say something meaningful about sex. Half the time I don't know what she's moaning about or singing about because the loud beats drown her out. That is normally the case, but more so than normal on this thing. Will the real Janet Jackson please stand up?"
2,its a flop for me,"im a product of the eighties, so when a singer from that era comes up in the 21st century, its nice to know that they have the staying power.but this album is nothing but hyped sex... i mean she purrrs like a cat in heat in this album. and the lyrics are so ....similarly, the way the album is laid out, with interludes like in the 1814 album, its way too repeated, this is like the 3rd or 4rth album with the same formula.im just waiting for the next album where she totally exposes her b**bs and says its ""a costume malfunction."""
2,Not worth it,"Unless you are a hardcore Janet fan, I wouldnt waste money on this album. Truth is, Janet hasnt had a good album since ""The Velvet Rope"". I dont know what she was doing on here, but I found myself incredibly bored throughout the whole CD. She only had maybe two stand out songs and they were both released as singles. One of them was ""Just a little while,"" which is a really good song and shoudl've been a big hit...but it wasn't. Perhaps it was overshadowed by ""Nipplegate""."
4,Janet Damita Jo Jackson...,"...Knows how to sing! I like this CD alot. Except for ""Warmth"" but overall its a good CD. 8/10."
1,Boring,Janet Jackson for a while along with Jam&Lewis seemed to be striving for something.granted she never had that much depth as a Vocalist but she had a vibe that worked but now she just seems content on getting by with Formula driven material as to challenging herself.Her vocals never get going&the Production feels like Microwave food that has been cooked over twice before&Still is icy.
5,A Review,"I think shoppers are a bit smarter here than the one person posting many multiples of negative reviews give them credit for. This is a great cd. Janet has worked with long time producing team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Luis for many albums, and this time she steps outside of the safety and comfort zone that they provided. The result is a great sexy album she created working with different producers such as Babyface, Kanye West, Dallas Austin.Standout tracks like the sexy sweet Moist, the dance floor funk of All Nite, the bouncey Jay-z sampled Strawberry Bounce, the old school party throwback sound of R&B; Junkie are just a few of the tracks that deserve a listen. Janet fans will love the album, and the haters that have posted multiple negative reviews here will continue bashing something they never bothered to listen to and wouldnt have purchased anyway."
1,JANET'S TIME IS TICKING,INDUSTRY ANALYSTS HAVE JUST CONFIRMED THAT DAMITA JOE IS SELLING BADLY AND HAS TANKED SO IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO ASK THIS OLD WOMAN TO CALL IT A DAY AND ALLOW YOUNGER STARS TO EMERGE.THIS ALBUM IS HORRIBLE SO AVOID.
3,not the real janet,ive always loved janet her albums were always new and fresh but this album is not janet i think janet is trying to put herself in that britney spears poppy mold and she just doesnt fit most of the songs on this album sound forced and and dont seem her i think she needs to go back to the studio and start from scracth with some songs more her age and stop trying to be young and pop and leave that to brtney.and make a 5 star album and not a three star one
1,Separate Ways,"Well, as they say all things change. Janet lost me on this one. But to be honest, she barely held my interest with VR. I'm not feeling the vibe on this at all. Too much sex(...)in her songs. (..) I only like ""All Nite"" cuz I saw her perform it live. Love that she can out dance the best world class trained dancers still! But as for the direction of her music. I guess I must say goodbye. Not worth my hard earned money. Love you Jan as a person an all but geeze hun keep your clothes on for once. (...) Too over EXPOSED musically, lyrically & professionally...."
3,only worth buying for half of the music,"the music isn't so bad on this CD but a lot of the songs are nothing special like on her previous albums, they're just boring and you find yourself skipping tracks all the time. The singles released so far, along with about 5 other songs(Spending Time With You, Island Life, r&b junkie, Like You Don't Love Me, Thinking Bout My ex) are the best cuts on the album, but I don't care for the rest, it's too sexual to enjoy."
2,Who Changes Who?,"There was a time when Janet would be known for changing the game. Unfortunately, it looks like the game is changing Janet. That's too bad."
3,"All for You, Part II","A remarkably, un-remarkable CD; Now it's not a bad CD as many would have you to believe. But the level of expectation for Janet is much higher than the majority of artists; The label's promotions staff miscalculated in leading with a ballad rather than a up tempo cut; Look what ""Yeah"" did for Usher on a CD consisting of mostly R&B ballads;"
1,"Buffy's take on ""Damita Jo""","Janet,what happened? Even though this is a much better album than that load of you know what ""All For You"" was,it's still not in the same league as ""Control"",""Rhythm Nation 1814"",""Janet"" or ""The Velvet Rope"".Janet,the sex thing has been done more effectively already so let it go.Put some clothes on and put out another GREAT album worthy of your best four.P.S.: Jam & Lewis it's time to let someone else produce a JJ album.The magic isn't there anymore.I know that you two have given JJ her biggest hits and best albums.After 19 years,The Jam/Lewis,Jackson connection has grown stale."
3,The bonus tracks should have been on the worldwide version.,"Damita Jo is not my favorite Janet CD, in fact I think it's one of her weakest releases to date.. and that's why I don't understand why two of the best songs are only found on this very expensive Japanese version.She should have dropped some of the boring ballads such as the embarrising and unsexy ""Warmth"" and ""Moist"" and put these pretty little songs on the CD instead.I hope her next project sounds more original and fresh because I'm not buying ONE more Janet CD about sex. Enough is enough!"
5,Truely for a Mature and Open- Minded Person to appreciate,"It Honestly took me a couple of times to listen to it to understand the overall theme and connection of this CD. I feel that she did a GREAT job using the theme of Sex and Love and interweaving the various characters that live within us and how and when we use them. In my car was the BEST and most intense feeling I got from it.The problem I have isn't with the CD...it's the reviewers that are purposely attempting to TERRORIZE her because of the Superbowl Issue. These reviewers have NEVER purchased a Janet CD or even liked her from day one,but they are insistant to pollute people with their personal feelings instead of reviewing the CD...MINUS the Superbowl Event.(...)"
5,AMAZING ALBUM,"I wasn't sure what to expect when i first bought this cd. When i popped it in i was blown away. Every song on this album has a blazin beat, it's own individuality. It's so rare that an artist is able to cover all different kinds of genres of music and do it flawless. Every song takes you to a different place. Props to Miss Jackson on this one and all the amazing producers on this album(Kanye West, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Rockwilder, Bobby Ross Avila, BAG and Anthor) because it is genius ! This is one of the best R&B records made in years. A must have for all R&B fans."
1,Pathetically laughable,"I used to be a massive fan, but it seems Janet's (once sparingly) sensual tracks over time have slowly escalated to trashy & lame. Every track on this album has the same theme. ""I want to undress you and... (Insert slutty chorus here)"". Time to deflate your ego Janet. Sex does not make a woman powerful.We heard her soft breathing and moaning on the last few albums. Surprise surprise! Here it is again.... & again & again & again. Very classyWelcome to rock bottom Janet."
3,"Better than All For You, but still hardly her best work","After her increasing obsession with samples got a little out of control with her 2001 album All For You, Janet Jackson really needed to get back on track with her next album. This album (which is not completely sample-free) is only marginally better. There are a couple of OK songs on here such as ""Truly"" and ""I Want You"", plus the steamy sex ballad ""Warmth"" which is probably more notable for its dreamy, non-sampled instrumentation rather than for Janet's vocal prowess (which is at a minimum on this song). As I've mentioned in my reviews of her other albums, Janet Jackson is one of the cornerstones of my musical upbringing, but she's really wearing out her welcome big time. She should've retired after The Velvet Rope and just created an EP of the few acceptable songs she's made since."
4,A bit....sexual?,"Ok, first off note that I am a big Janet Jackson fan, and this is by far not her best work...nor the worst...Okay, first off, nota that this album is all about Janet's true sexuality. It has very sexually strong and explicit lyrics (and sounds). Pick up this one if you are a hardcore Janet fan or somebody looking for a woman talking about...well....sex...Top 5 songs:All Nite Dont StopDamita JoJust A Little WhileIsland LifeR&B; JUNKIEWorst songs:TrulyStrawberry Bouncethe rest are ok, but overal i really like the album as it shows a strong sexual side to Janet Jackson, which is a talented artist."
5,I've never liked janet's musci until now,"I am really feeling this album and to the FEW people who have trashed it, it's soo obvious that you truly don't know good music.It's worth the money"
1,It stunk!,"I didn't realize Janet had came out with this album until Discpline came out! I do remember seeing her single on BET and it was kind of a hit there, but she def. lost her mega star status after the super bowl incident. People were pissed, and she really took the heat for it. Which I think she deserved(to me the whole performance was raunchy).Other then that I gave this album shot and wound up disappointed. To me it seemed like Janet really lost her punch with this album. To me it just sounded really lame. The only two tracks I thought that were really strong were All Night and R & B junkie. I was like there's the janet I know and love! Uh, the rest just seems like really crappy filler! I wouldn't waste my time unless your a janet fan. This is like a 16 y.o. valley girl pop album to be quite honest."
4,ok effort,"I wouldn't say this is janet's best album ever, but when I do get in the mood I put it on and that ""magic hour"" is like heaven for me."
3,"It's okay, but nothing groundbreaking here","""Damita Jo"" is a good album for most artists, but for Janet it's relatively uninspired. At least she's consistent; this album picks up where ""All For You"" left off. While I've listened to the CD 3 or 4 times now, I haven't been able to get a handle on the vast majority of the songs. ""Moist"" does stand out for obvious reasons, and ""Just A Little While"" may make a comeback of sorts.Oh well, Usher's ""Confessions"" receives another week of top billing in my CD changer."
1,Boring,I dont see how people can give this 5 stars. Other than a few upbeat tracks. The rest is just a bore. It doesnt take talent to whisper. Her last cd was bad enough. This one might even be worse. I also think its funny how some peope who gave this 5 stars. Dont even like all the tracks on it. they do a song rating scale and dont give all the tracks a good score. So how cant it be five stars???
1,"overrated,overhyped",one of the worst releases of this year from this aging woman.this is even more terrible than her previous albums.not recommended.
1,Zero Musical Integrity,"More sensless pop from the other 'has been' Jackson. The whole Super Bowl peep show was clearly a pathetic attempt to get her name back in the headlines. How about writing and singing your own songs???? Sampling and lyp synching are a farse.I'm sure a million dollar video with her rehashed dance moves will sell decent numbers of this cd to those who are willing to waste their money on 'style' over substance. Good thing for Janet, as this cd has none of the latter."
4,Go Damita Jo,This is a great Janet CD. I'm happy Janet has moved back to a more R&B sound. Tracks such as Like You Don't Love Me and Island Life are fresh. R&B junkie is kool with a nice 70's bump. It's a shame the best songs have not made it to the radio. Damita Jo has been in my CD player since March 30th. Pick up that new Deborah Cox Ultimate CD too.
2,Only OK,"Too many weak tracks and lazy production drag this album down. And Janet, bless her heart, is getting a little long in the tooth for (...) the four-letter words. Even her best albums have been stylistically reckless and self-indulgent, but they at least yielded a handful of strong singles. I've always gone along for the ride, and I preordered this CD. It's OK, but it's her worst. What was her inspiration? Doing it? On every other track, she wants to do you, or she wants you to do her good. ""R&B Junkie"" and ""All Nite"" are BOTH about being a junkie and dancing all night, so I can't tell them apart unless I read my iPod."
5,Enough Said,"This album explains yet again why Janet Jackson leads the pack in the world of pop divas. It not only gives you the upbeat danceable tempos we're used to, but also, those sassy ballad and erotic overtures we've come to love. This album is a must have; yet, another item to enter into our janet dynasty."
5,Damita Jo is great,Janet has done it again with Damita Jo. The album is fanuminal just like Ms. Jackson. I suggest that everyone got and buy a CD. I promise you will like it.
5,Even my husband liked this album!,"I bought Damita Jo today and even though my husband is not a fan of Janet, I had the CD blaring today. We both liked it very much! Very nice music to listen to while sipping some wine. Gets you in the mood. ;-)Can't wait to see Janet on tour."
4,nice job janet,"The lyrics are too too graphic and all that sex talk does not suit the sweet, friendly, humble, classy janet we see in interviews at all, but musically she is a winner on this album. The musical production is superb and her most urban sounding album to date with influences of r&b and hip hop. It's much better than All For You and just as good as Velvet Rope, but not as good as Rhythm Nation or janet. With the new single All Nite coming out soon, I hope this album increases in sales"
3,"Not fantastic, just... nice","DAMITA JO has good tunes, most of them fresh up-beat ones (SEXHIBITION, SLOLOVE, STRAWBERRY BOUNCE, DAMITA JO), other mid-tempo songs (ISLAND LIFE, my favourite on the album). Wht is boring of this cd is the collection of ballads in the second part of the cd, such as MOIST and WARMTH: too much explicit, their message is just too heavy, and.. musically boring, even if well produced as usual by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. Buy it if you usually like Janet for her frashness and not for her sexual.. slolyrics!"
3,JUST A LIL BAD!!!,"i think it's not worst like you people all said!!!! it got alot good song.....but it can't help this album better...my most fave in this cd are:5.My baby(feat Kanye west)-10/10 a sweet song had a lil catchy beat...it's good 4U to dance to!!!9.Island life-the sweet song...it's catchy...it's good 4U to hear when you walk along the sea with your lover...10/1010.All nite-OH MY GOD...the best dance song in the album....sexy voice,catchy music...everything just going perfect....20/1012.I want you-The best slow song in the album....the song is perfect....20/1014.Thinin' about my ex-really good song...10/1022.Just a liltle while-the reason make me want to buy this album....evryday when i wake up i just turn on this song....make me feel so happy,i just go want to go wind in the morning!!!! 20/10"
5,One of Janet's best!,"Although I think The Velvet Rope is the best Janet album, Damita Jo is by far better than All For You. Where The Velvet Rope was more introspective, Damita Jo is just all out fun. It sort of reminds me of the janet album. This album has a great feel about it and will be in my cd player non stop for a few months. I LOVE YOU JANET!!!"
5,This is great,"Man this is a really O.K. album and it's great to hear her pour herself in this peace of work, and it's beautiful. but its my least favorite of them (even Dreamstreet) but its not so bad, like I said its not to bad, and it is different,and i think maybe she picked the wrong time to do this style though."
2,ATTENTION ALL LAWYERS - PLEASE READ,"She totally ripped off the cover from Sade's Love Deluxe album circa 1992. In my opinion, Sade pulled it off much better.As for the album, I've listened to several tracks and can only tolerate ""SloLove."" Had she released that song as the first single, the album might have went somewhere . . ."
3,"Not Too Bad, Not Too Good","Janet's Damita Jo isn't bad, but it's not that great either. There are some tracks that are good and even fun to listen to. Most of the 22 tracks are pass worthy. Highlights: My baby feat. Kanye West, R&B Junkie, & Thinkin' Bout my Ex. I wouldnt' buy the whole CD. Download the good tracks if you can. In comparison to her older albums...this one doesn't compare. It's over the top with all the sexualy charged lyrics...which has been over done by Janet at this point...how about something different? The classic Janet is nowhere on this album...I miss songs like ""Alright"" and ""Miss U Much"". Personally, I think I have heard enough about Ms. Janet's sex life."
4,As always...Janet Delivers,"As a true Janet fan, I knew I had to purchase the album regardless of all the negative press. And as expected....Janet has delivered us another one! This album is definatley better then All For You. I love the R&B, Jazzy feel. The album is very sexy...but when has Janet not been? When is the concert..because I am there. One question though,is that song thinking about my ex boyfriend for JD??:)"
1,Stick with WHITNEY HOUSTON,"I purcahced this album after buying such greats like ""JANET"" and ""THE VELVET ROPE"" I was so dissapointed! Where are the catchy songs? Where are those unique vocals?! (...)"
2,"light, breezy listen.... return of pop Janet....","""Damita Jo"" is a light, breezy listen with a number of fun songs to listen/dance to.... its only down side is a couple of them sound like something the talentless Britney Spears could have done. The by-now ultra familiar interludes are here. Janet Jackson fans from way back will find much to like here, but it's not on par with her best, such as ""Rhythm Nation."" It's arguably on the same quality level as ""All For You,"" but without anything as infectious as that album's title track. A pleasant enough listen, without the self-consciousness of such albums as ""Velvet Rope."""
2,OK at best...,"After listing to Janet's latest CD, I can't help but wonder if she's in a terrible rut. Her releases have always seemed to focus on a theme, whether it be independence (""Control""), unity (""Rhythm Nation""), love (""Janet""), or acceptance (""The Velvet Rope""). Things seemed to start going downhill with 2001's ""All For You."" Maybe it was the focus on the sample, maybe it was the weak vocals and omnipresent giggles, but it was seriously lacking the punch of her prior releases. With ""Damita Jo,"" there are a few decent tracks to be found - ""All Nite"" (Don't Stop),"" which reminds me of the Black Eyed Peas' ""Hey Mama"", ""I Want You,"" an instant classic that might fit well into an old jukebox, and ""My Baby,"" which features a slick cameo by Kayne West. Overall, though, it seems like Janet's focusing on the ""shock and awe"" value - she's no stranger to pushing buttons, but there's a difference between being coy and being downright explicit."
5,Big Pimpin' 2004,LIKE IT I LOVE IT I WANT SOME MORE IF.IT'S THE BOMB. IT'S GRRRRRRRRRRREAT. THE BEST IF ALL.I'M A GIRL AN MOST GIRLS LIKE IT BECAUSE SHE IS NOT NASTY.
5,Dance worthy Damita Jo!,"I absolutely love Janet's latest ablum, Damita Jo. Its a bit of departure from her previous ablums, but its definately hot. Lots of groove worthy dance tracks. It will get your booty shakin'! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!"
2,Very little growth on Damita Jo,"For an artist of Janet's stature who has the ability to surround herself with very talented people, I am a little surprised that this album sounds so similar to All for You, the Velvet Rope and Janet. Very few songs stand out and except for the three songs in the middle of the album ""all nite"", ""r&b junkie"" and ""i want you"", I find myself skipping around a lot. Even the Kanye West collaboration borders on dull. The spoken interludes are downright silly and don't add much to an album. I would pass on this one and wait for the next Greatest Hits collection, which should be out in the next few years."
2,how the mighty have fallen....,"Janet must surely miss her younger days when everything she released to radio was instantly added, when her albums sold in the millions, and when she was seeen as the ""normal Jackson.""Some say media backlash is to blame for the complete commercial failure of this album. I beg to differ. This cd is simply just not good. I bought it, listened to it several times, searching in vain for standout tracks, memorable melodies, anything that grabbed me. Couldn't find it. And the cd now rests in the waaaay back of my stack, never to be played again. The Super Bowl debacle was just the final nail in her coffin. Rest in Peace, Miss Jackson."
5,One of Janet Jackson's Best CD's...,"Extremely impressive. This is a very happy and fun CD. After listening to it (several times).... I was very pleased with Janet Jackson's new CD ""Damita Jo"". It's very upbeat with great R&B, dance, pop, and slow jams on it!!!Some of my favorites are ""Island Life"", ""All Night"", ""R&B Junkie"", and ""SloLove"".JANET IS BACK!!! I'm loving her new sound. Her voice is stronger than ever and musically & lyrically... this is her best CD!!!Order this CD... and you won't be unhappy.5 stars out of 5 stars"
2,Making an exhibition out of herself...,"I was gravely disappointed with this album. It has too many slow songs on it, and the songs that are up-tempo, just don't go anywhere at all. Damita Jo was a good track, but it is way too short.The sex songs have got to stop. It was fun with her self-titled and Velvet rope albums, but by All for you, it began to get a bit old, and here she is, doing it again on three playboy/adult channel trashy tracks Sexibition/Strawberry bounce/Warmth and Moist. She is so pretentious as to be completely self-obsessed. It wouldn't at all surprise me if she were sexually inadequate.All in all, I shall award this CD with two stars, as Damita Jo, R&B; junkie and Slolove are good upbeat songs.I am hoping for better things with her next album."
3,"Good album, not the best","Damita Jo is a vision of Janet's new sexy attitude. The old Janet has disappeared completely from this album. At first, you see a shy girl from Control then a soldier from Rhythm Nation, to the nasty sexy Janet from Damita Jo. The album is very nasty and procative. The songs, such as ""Sexhibitation"", changes your reaction of Janet. This album is very different from any Janet release. It is too nasty to be on the radio. ... This album is a new reason to be afraid of Janet now."
1,CAREER MALFUNCTION,"As someone who likes to keep ""abreast"" of R&B;, I must saythat this latest effort by ""Damita Ho"" is a crashing BO!!Poor middle-aged Janet ran out of interesting ideas about 3CD's ago, and so has gone on to replace good songs with stalegrooves, 80's re-hashes, and boring sampling. And enough ofthe sexual stuff, girly girl! For a 38-year old woman to keeprubbing her ""self-discovery"" (i.e. ""I love my coochie"") in ourears is too much. Someone has lost Control!!"
1,Ugh,"Someone here wrote that this music makes you want to get up and dance. Hard to do that with your pants down around your ankles. There's only one purpose to this music. And once you hear a couple of cuts, you'll realize that the Super Bowl fiasco was no accident. This once-innocent girl (the last of the sane Jacksons) knows exactly what she's doing -- corrupting America in order to line her pocketbook. Surely there must be some other way to get rich, but that would be taking the high road, and high roads require integrity and talent."
1,Ummm... What happened Janet?,"I have enjoyed her albums Rhythm Nation, Janet, Velvet Rope and 3 songs from All For You, but this album is the worst. I dont feel the oomph that she normally puts into an album. This is what happens when works with different producers. Janet is a good singer, but she went downhill with this one."
2,Pretty Disappointed,"Have no doubt, I have loved JJ since her 'Control' album, but I have to be honest when I talk about 'Damita Jo.' I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the entire album. Yes, it has a good beat and yes it's fun to listen to however, she has seemingly become stagnant in regards to her message and what she would like to convey to her fans. If she is all about sex then good for her, but in my opinion there are other things out there that are more important and a woman with her power position could do something positive with her work. When I compare 'Damita Jo' to 'Rhythm Nation' I have to say I respected her more for her songs/lyrics on 'Rhythm Nation' than I do for her current work.I still think she is a fabulous entertainer, but this one is a disappointment."
4,Classic Janet,"I listened with a critical ear and was pleased by what I heard,in typical Janet form she let us know exactly how she's feeling these days in love and enjoying the person she's with.In light of the Superbowl ""showdown"" she hasn't conformed who she is lyrics still racey and very sexual on selected tracks,than their are those tracks that make you wanna report to the nearest dance floor for sweaty body contact, than the album hits you with her sensitive side with her take on friendship & love.All in all Janet comes thru with another classic album that can only come from this icon,true fans will be happy and new fans may even emerge from this mix of the old Janet mixed in with the character we now know as Damita Jo."
1,Really Disapointed,"I have been a Janet fan for quite some time, and this was definitely not her best. I have to say that I find that the ""genre"" of music she chose to introduce on this cd is really almost irritating. I wish she would just go back to the type of music she used to write on her previous cds."
5,Damita Jo is A Classic!,"Damita Jo is one of many great pieces of work Janet has put out. The whole CD is worth listening to, including the interludes. Janet has reached another creativity peak in her career. With the songs, ""All Nite (Don't Stop)"", ""Sexhibition"", and ""Strawberry Bounce"" (just to name a few), this CD will be in your car/cd player/stereo for quite a long time. Ballads like ""Thinkin Bout My Ex"" and ""Truly"" will make you appreciate Janet's ability to sing in many different genres. The lead singles ""I Want You"" and ""Just A Little While"", you can never get tired listening to. There's a song for every mood! Don't let the titles of the songs deceive you! Each song is extremely well done!! Even if you aren't a big fan of Janet, Damita Jo is THE album to buy!!"
4,"Forget about the controversy, think about the music","I'm not to fond of Ms.Jackson but I am soooo tired of people talking about the damn Superbowl, it's over with.I bought the album to see if she did that stunt to help her weak album. I was completely fooled, this is HOT!!! I wish she delievered some more dance tracks than she has on the album.Favorites are......Strawberry BounceR&B; junkieAll NiteWarmthIsland LifeSexhibitionThe album's lyrcis are not that explicit as they have been lead to believe by the critics."
5,Damita Does It Again....,"Damita Jo is an album about love. Throughout the 22 tracks you feel that love and it is a great feeling. This album has something to offer for everyone from hard hitting dance tracks to sweet ballads to a song in it own league bringing back the '80s. For the hardcore Janet fan this cd offers them a new flavor since Janet collaborated with different producers (Dallas Austin, Kanye West) yet still gave them something different. This CD is the MUST HAVE of the season. &quot;Relax, it's just sex&quot; MYM"
3,A LITTLE RELAXING I MUST SAY,"THE CD WAS NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR BUT IT IS A GREAT THING TO PLAY ON A DAY U WANT TO RELAX OR TAKE A RIDE ALONG THE SHORE,FOR THE JANET FANS THEY WILL LOVE IT . BUT I STILL LOVE ME GIRL MADONNA . JANET IT'S TIME TO RE-INVENT YOURSELF ... THANKS AND GOOD LUCK ON THIS CD...."
1,Give it up! Damita Jo.,"In a word, Terrible. Janet couldn't have heard this album before release, if she had she would have pulled it from production. In all but 3 songs, you couldn't tell who was singing, her voice is just not strong. The back-up singers should get top bill. The songs sounded like everything else she has done in the past 8 cds. I had high hopes for this CD, and was extremely disappointed. From the sound of her voice, no lack of a voice, she should give up singing."
1,Ooh No She Didn't,"I agree with the person who believes these five-star reviews are from Janet's record company or friends, etc. Janet hasn't made great music in a while but the last decent album she had was Janet. The Velvet Rope slightly passed the entertainment mark.(...) It's a shame she's compromising the talent she used to have so she can remain a black pin-up doll for people who weren't even old enough to remember her GOOD albums. All the songs sound a like and you can't understand a word she's saying half the time. Grow up, Janet. Skip this album unless you've misplaced your latest shipment of Viagra."
1,Don't Waste Your Time...or Money,"This is absoutely ridiculous. I was eagerly awaiting the new cd from Janet; expecting an offering that illustrated why she is the star the other ""wannabes"" in the pop world copy. Instead, all Janet comes up with is tired, uninspired lyrics, which all seem to focus on one thing. I'm beginning to think Janet has a serious hangup. This is a far fall from her ""Control"" and Rhythm Nation"" days. On the song, ""Damita Jo"", Janet claims to have ""class"" but she contradicts herself terribly as evidenced in the lyrics showcased on this cd. She leaves nothing to the imagination and the result is an utterly disguisting self-degrading mess. I would advise everyone to pass this one up...I'll be glad when Janet cleans up her act and returns to the regal form she once possesed.Don't let the innocent smile fool you; this is trash."
1,"Skip this one, unless you want music to fall to sleep by","This is primarily an album of R&B lite and ""Slow Jam"" music. While there are a couple semi decent songs, this is not an album to grove or dance to. To be frank, I found it boring and a waste of Janet's time, an anyone (else's time) looking foreward an ""Old School"" jam. My adice is to listen to ""Control"", ""Rythym Nation"",""Janet"", ""The Velvet Rope"" or ""All For You"" until Janet's next album after ""YO 20"" comes out. Lots of ""old School"" Janet fans, such as myself, have also skipped ""YO 20."""
1,This keeps getting worse,"Don't get me wrong. I use to be a fan of Janet Jackson's music. I loved the albums ""Control"", ""Rhythm Nation"" ""Janet"" and ""The Velvet Rope"". I couldn't wait for them. After I boutht ""All for you"", I was totally dissapointed. The music was bland, nothing special. I had high hopes for this album until I listened to it. What a waste! Not one good song. I miss the old Janet; I just don't know if the music she releases from now on is going to be this bad. My recommendation is to not buy this album. Save your money instead."
1,SHE NEEDS TO STOP NOW!!!,"After the last CD, I felt she was really trying to hard to be sexy.This DJ junk is nothing more than Adult Entertainment on CD. And as far as the so-called ""worbdrove malfunction"" at the Super Bowl? Please!!!It was all plan JJ, just in time for this DJ mess and you know it. Hell!! You've been busting out with your chest open since the 1990 MTV music awards ever since. JJ you are 40 years old now, your sex goddess days, when you were in your 20's are over!!! Stop with the sex pot act, get some class and taste back. Or for that matter, you seriously need to mature your image and sound."
2,What Was She Thinking?,"I like Janet Jackson, but this CD is.....just a waste of...I don't know. I listen to:1. Sexhibition2. I Want You3. Spending Time With You4. All Nite (Don't Stop)5. Strawberry Bouncebut the other 15,16 songs are skippable. When I listen to this CD, I feel like she rushed through making it. When compared to ""All For You"" and her other CDs, this should not even have been released. She should have took more time on the music instead of releasing it right after the SuperBowl, so it could sell, but it is not."
3,"Wait, she may not be as good as michael but shes great","Wait! Some people have said that all of the five star reviews come from the record company and her PR people but where do all the 1 star reviews come from? One person or two who are against her.SHE MAY NOT BE NOWHERE AS TALENTED AS MICHAEL, but you can't say there isn't a track on this album that you don't like. All Nite is a groovy sexually motivated dance song. I Want You is her best work since Together Again and Go Deep. Strawberry Bounce is a great dance song. You can't slam it for the chorus. Its a simple catchy chorus. This album may not be anywhere as great as her previous albums except All For You, but if you need these songs, buy the new All Nite Single that even includes I Want You and the videos for them.I love Janet. Maybe next time she'll drop the hip hop and rap and continue writing and singing with the voice she has left for R&B; songs that will hopefully match the effort of songs like Doesn't Really Matter and Got Til Its Gone."
1,"This album is a waste of material, time, and money.","I should have known this album would be plagued with seriously quiet whispering and incessantly stupid lyrics; but nothing on this planet could have prepared me for how lame this album is.On yet another album, Janet shamefully sneezes out lame tracks like ... uh ... every track on this album. Her voice is buried (as usual) beneath an assault of grungy guitars, similar sounding back-up singers, drums, and a lot of unidentifiable noise. Aside from ""All Nite (Don't Stop)"" and ""Strawberry Bounce"" the rest of the album made my fingers itch to switch the player off.It's embarrassing (for the artists, their ""posse"", their companies, and whoever else dips in their celebrity pool) that artists can get away with such sub-par music, lyrics, and ""vocal stylings""."
2,What happened?,"I'm in shock with this album. I'm so happy I didn't shell out $13 bucks for this album (rapsody just paid for itself this month). I tried to listen to this cd several times and couldn't get into it. There were only 2 songs worth anything, including the first single. It's way too mellow for way too long. The only real fast song is Just a Little While. Just buy that single, you'll save some $$$."
3,"Janet, are u there??","I am a huge janet fan. I am very dissapointed with this CD.It is way too mellow, and just does not have anything unique, or that stands out.Anybody could sing most of these songs. Expected a lot more from her, with the producers that she has on here.A few of the songs are ""nice"", but nothing that is really great.She is not a Whitney or Mariah. She needs to keep a nice selection of fast songs on all her CD's.I just dont here an Escapade, If, Thatrs the way love goes, miss you much even an All for YouIts not a bad CD, but its not a great one either.Never thought i would say this but Michael's Invincible was better than this CD"
3,"I Love Janet, but...","Ok, I'm a big fan of Janet's first off. I will continue to buy her music for that reason. I'm not completely bowled over by this CD so far. But I wasn't really surprised because I wasn't crazy about her last two CD's either. She still hasn't come close to doing anything as good as the 1993 Janet CD in my opinion. I'm also a little puzzled about her choice for a first single. However, I believe that this CD will still be big, just because she is Janet and she knows how to pull it off. She's the epitome of an entertainer and I expect her next single to really help propel this CD."
1,Great artist....but needs to retire,"Sorry Janet. You need to realize that using the same sexed up image for the past decade or so isn't going to work anymore. You're not in your 20s. Follow Madonna's example and be more mature and come out with a new sound and acceptable look (remember Madonna from 1990-98? She came back and strong with Ray of Light). I always loved Janet, but it bothers me that time after time, she comes up with more garbage and doesn't improve well. Thank goodness this flopped b/c this album is complete trash. Using dirty sexy lyrics makes her look more desparate sadly. I was fine with the janet album, but this needs to end. Janet has officially lost it and somewhere down the road lost her talent as well. Just think of her as the r&b version of Lil Kim. The sad thing is that her troll doll bf is ruining her too. He needs to stop destrying her legacy. Get Rhythm Nation, janet., or Velvet Rope."
1,What has this woman done with Janet?,"Don't get me wrong - I like Janet. I own her albums. I watch her videos. But after putting this CD in my stereo and skipping over many of the songs after about a minute, I'm beginning to wonder what's happened to the talented, intelligent, sassy Janet I used to know. There's only so much heavy breathing and whispered words one can take...but saying that, the middle of the album (Island Life, All Nite, R&B Junkie) isn't bad. At least it has some sort of melody and tune going on. The rest of the CD tends to blend in to each other; there's nothing here to tempt me into listening to this album again. I could imagine this coming from Beyonce, but Janet? Give me Rhythm Nation 1814 any day."
1,"Yep, it's boring","I haven't come close to enjoying a JJ album since Design of a Decade, and this one moves even further back. It seems JJ is more interested in undressing than delivering a decent set of songs. The continued use of the spoken passages combine with the other elements to give me the impression of a very self-absorbed personality. There's very little of interest on this lackluster collection of whispers."
4,Better than u think!,"After all the bagging Janet's received lately for her actions and this highly awaited album, i started to think that maybe i would soon be buying my 1st Janet album that i do not love.WRONG. Though janet's definitely moved away from the sounds of Rythym Nation and Velvet Rope, to a more mellow vibe, this is still ONE GOOD RECORD. The best songs/beats are:Damita Jo, My Baby, SloLove, Like You Don't Love Me.The rest are awesome too, it just depends on your mood!Buy it."
4,It's pretty good,"I like Janet's latest album ""Damita Jo"". It's more 'quiet storm R&B' than previous efforts. Initially it reminded me of Beyonce's ""Dangerously In Love"" album in the sense that I expected more upbeat dance songs, but turned out to be a lot of mid tempo/slow jams. The thing about Janet Jackson and her team of producers, they always produce quality music. Most of the songs could be singles. I can't say that about too many albums. In addition to Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Janet worked with Kanye West and Rockwilder on a few tracks. The surprise for me was the Babyface penned ""Thinkin' About My Ex"". It's the standard Babyface-produced sound. I skip that track everytime. Hot Tracks: Damita Jo, Strawberry Bounce, Island Life, My Baby, All Nite (Don't Stop), R&B Junkie, Like You Don't Love Me, Warmth, Moist, and SloLove."
2,"Janet, Janet, Janet","First I want to say I love Janet, I can put her on in my car and go for long drives. With that said, I would barely make it around the corner with the cd. I dismissed Just a Little while and I want you as radio songs, but once I got the cd they were two of the scant few listenable songs. I love sexy songs, but I think that if she was more subtle they would be sexier. And like with All for You she has those strange spoken interludes, on one hand I'm glad they are separate tracks that way I can skip through them, but on the other there are too many and they don't add anything. Velvet Rope and All for You were pure GOLD, but Damita Jo is like cheap copper."
5,Sensational,"This CD is full of gems. I love this CD better than any of the others. Especially moist, that track is on point."
5,H-O-T!!,"DAMITA JO is a fantastic album. It's a light-hearted album from Janet and full of songs about love. The club jams are my favorites. I can't get enough of ""All Nite"" (hope it's the next single) and ""R&B Junkie"" has that old school feel. ""My Baby"" is a great track as well, that could easily be a single. In fact, DAMITA JO is chock full of potential hit singles. I could see ""Island Life"", ""Spending Time With You"" and ""Thinking About My Ex"" all released as singles. Only time will tell......but Janet has done it again. With DAMITA JO, she's back and better than ever!!"
5,A Great Addition to Janet's Discography,"All I have to say is that this cd is a great glimpse into Janet's continuous devlopment as an artist. Being that this is her eight release, and the fact that Janet continues to bring her listeners a refreshing take on the current musical landscape, shows that she is always evolving. A great addition to anyone's Janet collection (and if you don't have one......what are you waiting for? :)"
1,This Sux So Bad...,"Hehe, i was a Janet Fan from Control to Velvet Rope, AFY suckedand We have another question... Who Just Released Another Terrible Album?...Janet Jackson!!!Congrats. You've won Another Sh*tty Janet Album!!Nothing To Ever Get Excited About!!! Every Song Sucked!!!All You Hear on like 10 of the 22 tracks, Uhhhhhhhh Uhhhhhhh...That's Not Really what we want to hear!!!Avoid At All Costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They Should regret not putting a Zero-Star Rating on this site!!!"
1,"Janet, what happend???","Every time Janet comes out with a new album, I'm never disappointed- until now.This album is COMPLETE garbage. The music is plain, the lyrics are repetitive (all she talks about is sex), and her vocals are drowned out by the music. Not only that, she worked with lousey outdated producers like Babyface and Dallas Austin, who haven't been hot since the early nineties. Kyane West, who is for some reason considered the ""hot"" producer at the moment, doesn't do anything but bring Janet another lame song with a lame rap that doesn't make sense with ""My Baby."" The only good song on the album is ""All Nite (Don't Stop)"", which is filled with whirling synths and has a good beat. Other than that, the whole thing sucks. I always try to listen to each song all the way through, but this was so bad that on several songs, I found myself skimming and skipping through.Janet, please stick with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis next time. It's obvious they are the only ones who can give you good songs."
3,Typical Janet,"The cd is just okay. It is not anything to write home about. If you like Janet than you may like it, if you like music in general you will think it is okay.I wish Janet would have done something different with this album. If you got any of her other albums you should save your money and replay them because this will be the same experience.Although this cd is a lackluster there are some stand out songs:I want youR&B junkie (cool)Moist (nice sound)Like you dont love me (kinda interesting take)"
2,"Janets Wosrt album since ""Dreamstreet""","Really this album sucks FOR A JANET ABLUM. That being said its still better than most of the crap that is out there.Many of the songs are dirty without being fun and exciting. And you know something sucks when they cant even make sex fun and exciting.Seriously this ablum lacks the hip dance beat, quality slow grooves and creative songs we are used to seeing from janet. There is little here to recommdend to anyone.There are 3 good songs here:""Strawberry Bounce"", is a sexy but fun song, that tries out some new beats and has that ""Go Deep"" and ""All For You"" dance party feel to it. Just made for a dance floor.""R and B Junkie"", plays homage to old school classics! If you loved the classics you will love this.""All Nite"" is a passable song that only stands out so much because the rest of the album is so unexciting."
5,best cd ever,"Janet Jackson's Damita Jo is some of her best work yet... I dont think there is a track on here I dont like but my favorites are Sexibition, Strawberry Bounce and All night,just to name a few the beats are awesome and she never ceases to amaze me.."
5,Awesome,"I believe that this is one of the Janet's best. There are great dance tracks that are infectious (Sexhibition and All Nite [Don't Stop]) and slow ""baby making"" songs as J herself says (warmth and moist). This is quite a departure from her pop/rock roots. This is a more R&b and Hip Hop influenced record. Every song is great, although 2 or so had to grow on me. I love it!"
4,"If You Are A Fan, You Will Love It!!!","As a big fan of Janets I have to say, that I am satisified with Damita Jo. I am giving it four stars, however I see lots of reviews saying its not her best and that All For You Cd wasnt good at all. To me all untrue. While I will agree with the fact that its not her best as to why I gave it four stars, it is however very good. What is one's best anyway? Nobody really who come out with a great cd once usually can top themselves again, Janet has come out with many good cds, and I believe this is just as good as All For You. In this day we think sales is what makes something someones best work, sometimes thats just not the case. I think if you are a true Janet fan you will enjoy the cd."
3,It's no Velvet Rope...,"Damita Jo is decent but mediocre, not quite on par with All For You, which still wasn't anything great, but was just as enjoyable as this album is. Still, don't expect an accomplishment like The Velvet Rope, which was not only by far Janet's best work but one of the best album's of the decade, if not of all time."
3,it's alright,"it's not her best album but I wish All Nite Don't Stop was doing better on the charts, everyone I know seems to love that song"
4,As always...Janet delivers!!!,"Janet Jackson is known for putting out music that showcases exactly where she is as an artist as well as an individual. This album certainly does not stray from that tradition. The production on this album is incredibly tight. Although at times the lyrics are a bit tough to understand, after taking a closer listen I realized that she really does have a lot that she is trying to express on this piece...and it is not just sex. This is one of those CD's that one should just sit back, relax and take a really close listen to. A very simple yet deep work that lets the world know exactly why Ms. Jackson, or Damita Jo for now, is the star that she is. I love it!"
3,Ignorant people!!,"To the ""reviewer"" from Riverdale, GA that was RUDE and UNCALLED for. You don't disrepect Michael and Janet like that. You have NO PROOF Michael is a child molester so son't call him that.As for the Damita Jo album, overall it's mediocre. But I would take this album any day over All for You."
1,This is her worst album to date,"This is the worst album that Janet has put out to date.In fact except for the song ""R&B Junkie"" that is the only song that can inspire me to pick up this CD. My feeling if this is the best that she can do -- then she needs to stop recording. My suggestion to anyone seeking to buy this album -- Don't!!!. If you must listen to it, borrow from some one who didn't have any type of warning (like me) or download it. Don't pay full retail price for this one. I love the old Janet -- but this is definitely ""garbage."""""
1,What is this mess? I'm very dissapointed.,"This is horrible. What a mess. It's so unoriginal. What's with all the talking and rambling on before the songs? This CD is about only one thing, SEX. It's getting old. This is by far the worst music from Janet. I'm not blown away at all. I'm convinced that if not for the superbowl mess, there would be no mention of Janet or this CD at all it's that bad. The music is bad, but her vocals are even worse. Janet was never a strong singer to begin with but she always had great music to back her up. Here she has neither decent vocals or good music."
2,PLAYED OUT!!!,"Okay first of all I was a fan, but like someone already said enough with the sex, because at the end of the day to stay in the game you are going to need some talent! Everything that's over exposed gets tired after a while, and this CD is so tired!!!!! Retire Janet YOU ARE FRESH OUT OF IDEAS!!!!!!!!"
4,THINKIN BOUT MY EX,"A WELL NEEDED 2 HEAR SONG 4 ME RT NOW , I AM SO THERE AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN RELATE. ALTHOUGH IT,S KINDA HARSH 2 HEAR SHE MKS IT SOUND SO BEAUTIFUL,WOW. THE ABLUM IS COOL NOT HER BEST BUT NOT HER WORST EITHER, IT HAS A FEW STAND OUT SONGS, ALL NITE , LIKE U DON,T LOVE ME, MY BABY, AND THINKIN BOUT MY EX, A VERY WELL WRITTEN AND PRODUCE SONG BY BFACE, WHEN IS HE COMIN BK OUT WITH SOMETHING."
1,Why would someone buy it?,"I think this is the worse Janet album ever. Low songs, lyrically uninspired, nothing new but the boring melodies and poor songs. Could be compared to the first Britney album because of the lack of quality and artistical relevance."
1,"Hey, what's happening with her?","Sorry, but right now I can understand why she was so desperately trying to claim attention with that ridiculous Superbowl performance. She knew that she's not inspired at all at these times (actually since AFY) and there are no excuses for her since she peaked with Velvet Rope and didn't need to leave the right way of doing music. She assumed in an interview that she sees Britney and Cristina as younger competition and this CD is a sad try to do teenage pop. The songs are simply BORING, she whispers all the time, the lyrics are VERY BAD, the rhythms are VERY BAD, the album is a waste of money, but I understand that everybody was expecting something better from her. This is sh_tty."
1,Response To James Greenly,"Okay James, I can see you think I'm ignorant....hm. And with my attitude I'm going to bring down this country. Or this once great country.Its people like you whom support such horrible albums made these days that are bringing down the country. If you like the direction music is going these days, then well, you have a problem and I'd advise you to shoot yourself.If this is what Janet is going to be like in the next 5 years, if she can even make it that long...hahahahahaha....then we should shoot her as well. Its a shame how you say that we shouldf feel sorry for people who make albums and put effort into making albums.I feel more sorry for those people out there who waste $15.00 on a piece of crap. FYI....get a life, and get a mind."
1,"Record Company ""Grass Roots Hype""","It is a trip reading so many dishonest reviews here. 5 stars for this career malfunction? Well the reason for these ""great reviews"" is that Jackson's record company is paying or ordering their PR staff members to flood this site with glittering reviews in order to con you into buy this musical malfunction trash. Well, don't believe the hype and don't buy the disc. In fact, when you read too many glittering reviews for any CD here on this Web site, you should always take it with a great big sack of salt. Listen for yourself and then decide! And save your money!!!!!"
5,simply the best,I have been a fan for years and after listening to this cd I am even a bigger fan.Keep up the good work janet.
5,Fresh and Retro at the same time.,"After the surprisingly poppy lead single, I was relieved to hear the rest of the album. There are some great, infectious beats on this album, and Janet explores music that is more ""hip-hop"" than anything else she has done in the past. I agree with people who think the short interludes are lame, but to discredit the music because of the short 15 second clips is kind of absurd. That's what the skip forward button is for. It's a shame that the Super Bowl mishap is overshadowing this album."
4,Great job!!!,"To me, this one one of her best cd's. I was afraid to hear it at first because i didn't know what to expext, but after the first few songs i was hooked. Best songs are Spending time with you,Strawberry Bounce, All Nite and Warmth. I recommend everyone to buy this cd!!"
5,One of her Best!,"Janet Jackson gets better and better! This CD is amazing, and it will really put you in the mood, if you know what I mean!"
3,This album is just ok!,This album is not bad it has a few good songs but there are a deal of bad songs on here also!If you like Janet get this if you don't then you shouldent bother geting this!
1,trash,"why do you people listen to this? why? it is not good for the soul. it makes you do things you shouldnt. she is as bad as brittany, christina, kayne west, avril lavrigne, and pink. here r some people to listen to: jessica simpson (''sweet kisses'' only), stacie orrico, jump5, racheal lampa, zoegirl, and twila paris."
3,"alright, but could have been better","The era is still new and I'm already seeing this CD in used CD stores. What a shame. It may not be janet's best album, but the songs that are good on the album are worth listening to, especially All Nite(Don't Stop), Spending Time With You, R&B Junkie, Like You Don't Love Me and Thinkin Bout My Ex"
3,Not Janet's best,"When I heard ""Just A Little while"" on the radio, I couldn't believe that it was by Janet, it's so not her!The album isn't bad, but it's not amazing either. Some songs such as ""My Baby"", ""All Nite (Don't Stop)"" ""R&B; Junk"" or ""Thinkin' Bout My Ex"" are ok, but there's not a big hit in the album. Most of the album is full of sex themes, and let me tell you that she totally fails to impress. And hey, ""Just a little while"" sounds good after listening to the whole thing.... Most of the ballads are forgettable."
4,Hooks Galore!,Hooks abound on this collection. Janet employs some different producers along with Jam and Lewis and produces a CD full of potential singles. The best tracks:1. Damita Jo3. Strawberry Bounce5. My Baby10. All Nite11. R&B Junkie12. I Want You13. Like You Don't Love Me14. Thinkin' Bout My Ex20. Slo Love21. Just a Little WhileThere are some slow moments that drag the CD down but just program them out on your CD player and you've got a really great album.
4,NOT A MUSIC EXECUTIVE,"I don't understand all the negative reviews about this cd saying its so slow. I have always been a Janet fan and really enjoy her music. I know she is not the best singer out there, but I still think she makes good POP music (and I'm a POP music junkie) Now her last CD, ""All For You"", I have to say I really did not like. This one is a bit different and not as ""dancey"" but there are a lot of great tracks on it. Its not as good as her ""Janet"" cd, but that one would be hard to top that. I'm sure most of her fans have already have this, for those not sure about it,in my opinion, this is worth it to buy."
5,Best Yet,Janet does it again. I loved Janet and The Velvet Rope but this album is even better. Here is my rating 4 each track (not th e interludes)damita jo-5/5sexibition-5/5strawberry bounce-5/5my baby-6/5spending time with you-5/5island life-5/5all nite(dont stop)-6/5rnb junkie-4.5/5i want u-5/5like you dont love me-5/5thinking bout my ex-6/5warmth-5/5moist-5/5truly-4.5/5slolove-3.5/5just a little while-4/5
4,groovy,I think that the Damita Jo cd is hott if you listen to it without preconsptions you will really enjoy her cd. I really enjoy how she used her inner child flavor where you really ask yourself do I really know Damita Jo or do I know Janet Jackson. I thought it was clever how she made it so dimenensional to the point where if you didn't dig Janet you would dig damita Jo or vise versa. I really enjoyed the cd it gave a different quality of what is being giving today.
5,¡ Damita Jo Is Great Album !,"Now I have to admit it: I WAS on of those people who bought ""Damita JO"" then worked backwards. But it turned out that I really fell in love with ""Control"" and ""The Velvet Rope"". So my opinion of ""Damita Jo"" is really coming from the background of those two previous albums"
3,sometimes i like it other times I can't stand it,"this album is so r&b/hip hop and she does the style with conviction more so than other wannabes, but something about the album really annoys me though it gets me grooving at times. I don't think her vocals are that good at all on this CD she sings so softly and weakly unlike the power she displayed on previous efforts. Also there are too many tracks and some of the tracks were way too short. The highlights on the album for me are all nite don't stop, just a little while, r&b junkie, I want you, like you don't love me and thinkin bout my ex. Sexhibition and Strawberry bounce are funky hip hop too but too short and stale, they could have been a bit longer I guess. And the interludes on this are just stupid. I think now she does interludes for the sake of it not cause they are relevant."
1,B.O.R.I.N.G....zzzzzzzz,"Most of the reveiews of this CD (on Amazon) read like a music executive wrote them, trying to hype they're product.This CD is a real snooze...Boring really doesn't quite describe it! Save your $$$$...this is pure garbage!Just because your an aging ""Diva"" doesn't mean you have to start making music for the retirement-home set!What happened to the Janet we all know & love???"
2,Mindless repetition is boring.,"On the title track of this CD, Janet promises that she is going to dig deep and reveal the side of herself that the public doesn't see. Apparently, that side is as shallow and vapid as this CD. The production is great, and the songs are catchy, but the lyrics are mind-numbingly vacuous, and Janet's interludes. Janet doesn't understand that love doesn't originate between the legs.There is a line between erotic and trashy, and Janet crosses it over and over. I've been a Janet fan since ""Control"", and this album makes me yearn for the old days. Janet, put your clothes back on and bring back that sweet, smart, sexy woman that we all love."
2,yes I am a janet jackson fan,"this album is honestly one of her weakest ones, right down there with all for you. I can only tolerate about half the songs, but she's done so much better before and they don't live up to the real janet we all fell in love with. I also agree with many reviewers she's sold out trying to be like britney and christina, she's worse than them now actually taking fans places they don't want to go, being a fly on the wall in her bedroom at night basically. I hope janet can get her head straight and get back to making real music. People who like this CD are probably teeny boppers not old enough to remember the real janet jackson who gave us amazing music videos and albums with class, cause this longtime jackson fan is disappointed with janet, she hasn't done anything lately with her lousy new music and image. Go listen to michael jackson instead, his music is better anyways"
3,Very disapointing,"This album is a bit better than ALL FOR YOU, but it's not saying much. Gone are the thought provoking lyrics and catchy hooks, replaced is a woman who uses blantant sexuality to sell her records. It's not working though. Don't get me wrong, I was once a huge Janet fan, and in some ways I still am. DAMITA JO was very disapointing however. They finally released a good single, the third single ""All Nite"", which is a great club song and fun to dance to. ""I Want You"", honey leave emoting to the pros! You can't sing that well so just forget it. ""Just A Little While"" is ok but not as a single. Good songs: ""Slolove"", ""Island Life"", ""Damita Jo"", ""Sexhibition"", ""Spending Time With You"". Bad songs: ""Truly"", ""Moist"", ""Warmth"". 3 stars seems very generous for this bad cd."
2,Phoning It In,"Here we go again. More songs about sexuality. Even more dirty talk. More breathy ""singing"" and spoken interludes. This could be the Janet album, Velvet Rope or All For you, but it's the latest Janet Jackson album. Yea right! She's making the same album over and over again.There are a few tunes that get your head boucing, but none of it as honest and compelling as her best work. Only for the truly hard-core JJ fans out there."
1,TALENT MISFUNCTION!!,"Janet has always tried to emulate the career of Madonna, who is far more talented. When Madonna kissed Britney and Christina at the 2003 MTV Awards, Janet tried to top this by simulating herself getting raped at the Superbowl. Are Madonna and Janet desperate? YES! The difference is that at least Madonna pulled her stunt on MTV, where parents had the choice to not have their children watch. The Superbowl is a family oriented event. Janet hijacked this with her no talent antics and it was very shameful. The album, which features her having verbal orgasms, is just as pathetic."
5,Damita Jo,"To all the people who have given this album a 1 star, you have truly lost your minds. You don't know good music. And u are probably Britney Spears fans. I can't say enough about this album. This album is unbelieveable. I can't say anything else about it."
3,Janet what happened!!!!!!??????,"Having been a huge fan of Janet's 80's albums as well as the stellar VELVET ROPE, I was dissapointed by the overall lackluster sound and style of ALL FOR YOU. After her new single, JUST A LITTLE WHILE, I thought that maybe this cd would pickup where her JANET and VELVET ROPE left off but I am somewhat dissapointed. Yes, she is sexy! But does she have to talk about the same exact subject in each song?????!!!!! It gets old, plus not many of the songs have any major stylistic changes to tell them apart......I prefer more of her upbeat dance songs. If that is what you want, proceed to the store to buy this album with caution. If soft, sexy, funky background music is what you seek, pick this up! Better luck next time Janet!"
5,So Sensual,I Think this is Janet's best CD yet! It is so full of love and passion. I'm proud of her and I wish her and Jermaine the best. You go girl #1 Fan 4EVA!!!!!!
4,Terrific new series,"My 2 1/2 year old fell in love with Bear and his friends after one viewing. In this show, Tutter's grandmother visits. They also play with shadows. The songs are great.One of our favorite videos -- and we have lots."
2,The picture is wrong - this is 3-hole punched paper,"Do a search of the item product number - Hammermill 107681 - and you will find elsewhere that this is three-hole punched paper. The picture and description are wrong. A description at another site says this paper is acid-free, which is good, if you want 3 holes in the paper.It is 24 pound but it is 98 Brightness. A very shiny, thin paper, good for graphics as stated on another site.The ream I received was taped shut on both ends with transparent tape, and seemed to have less than a full ream. Some of the pages were curled or wrinkled. I returned the Hammermill 107681 paper and ordered other Hammermill laser paper."
1,Who needs planes when you can fly the American Ego,God save us all from avenging Americans and flawed but strong at heart female characters. And from authors who have their characters read their books in their fanasty worlds..
5,Brown is simply the best!,"This was my first book of Dale Brown. I finished it in a couple of days and then experienced some kind of blackness. I didn't have another of his books. So I simply went to Brussels and visited an English bookshop. They had all of his titles in their racks. In one day, I bought all other books. I now savour them. I read other authors like Tom Clancy, Harold Coyle, Richard Herman, etc. They are good but no one comes close to Dale Brown. I just hope he continues to write in this way for years to come."
4,"Great action, but a little TOO technical","""Chains of Command"" presents an interesting situation: the tactical use of nukes without the whole world going ape. Brown develops the story well, but his detail in the operations of the Vampire sometimes leave me anticipating the next chapter, and not in the good way. This minor flaw aside, this one's definitely worth it. Being a person who roots for the underdog, the attack on Ukraine leaves me aching for revenge, and the President and her husband (hah!) are truly evil. I'd recommend this book to most people, but true military nuts will enjoy it most."
3,"A GREAT READ, BUT IT WAS TOO TECH-NO","A GREAT BOOK, BUT I THOUGHT IT COULD HAVE BEEN LESS IN THE TECHNO AREA. IN FACT THIS WAS MY FIRST DALE BROWN BOOK. I WOULD SAY THAT I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER ONE UNLESS IT JUST GRABS ME. THE CHARCTER FURNESS AND MACE WAS THE BOMB IN THE STORY. AND THATS IN A GOOD WAY. IT STILL GETS 3 STARS. WOW ALREADY"
4,First time Dale Brown reader - enjoyed it to the end,"I haven't read many of these war/espionage novels, but this one I picked up before a long flight and I stayed glued until the finish. I thought that the F-111 flying narratives and the techno-aviation stuff were terrific (maybe because I'm a pilot). The political intrigue was well constructed, and perhaps even scary because it seemed too close to reality. The clash between the Turkish, and the US Air Force's use of women combat pilots, was also an intriguing element for me and I thought that Brown did an astute job in portraying the depth of cultural mismatch. Fast moving and easy to read, yet tense and exciting."
2,get the facts right,"I kind of like many of Dale's books, although I would rate them consistently lower than Clancy or Bond. This one is however below average. The first half is decent, especially the Desert Storm mission, although the top brass' reaction to the latter is unrealistic. The second half is a let-down, with totally unbelievable actions. And the Clinton bashing alone takes at least two points of the rating. By the way, maybe Mr Brown could buy a decent map of the world? The Hong-Kong gaff in Fatal Terrain has been highlighted before, but here he manages to mix up Slovakia (formed from the former Czechoslovakia) with Slovenia (formed from the former Yugoslavia), even in the map included in the book."
1,Too technical,I have read several books by Brown and he seems to suffer from Tom Clancey's urge to describe in minute detail the entire operations of a submarine. Only Brown's forte is airplanes and in the course of his plot he wants you to know as much about the operations of an airplane as he does. This creates many pages which I just gloss over hoping that something else in the overall plot will surface which will hold my attention. I did not even finish this book.
1,Customer Service?,"I've tried for 3 weeks to find out if they had a service company in the Des Moines, Iowa area!! Phone line is always busy, emails go unanswered, FAQ questions submitted to the... website go unposted?? I can't figure out why a company like APEX would let a prospective buyer slip away. I own a DVD player from APEX and I love it, but purchase a projection TV online... and not have local service??Surely they must also look at Amazon website??"
3,great looking tv awful product,received product. looked great watched it for 1 day and the picture tube died have to wait a month to be fixed. very upset otherwise good tv for what i watched of it.
2,2 months time to buy a new one,"I received my tv on time. It had a nice picture for 2 months and the convergence went out. If you read one of the other reviews, my tv is just like Jons from Los Angeles. The colors are out of whack and distorted and you can never get ahold of Apex because the phone is busy. So I called a repair center and they are coming out here to fix it for free because I have a 1 year warranty. I recommend to stay away from this product."
1,Dont Do It,"This TV is horrible, it worked for 2 hours and then the convergance blew. Worse than that, it had been a month and the warranty department is running me around in circles. So here I am a month after buying the TV and I still have no idea when the service center is going to attempt to help me. APEX IS BAD"
1,sorry,broke down after 11 months. been waiting over 6 weeks for repair. apex customer service is a joke.
1,What a Lemon,"We received the Tv and as soon as we hooked it up, there was no red. So we called and the only place that serviced it was 2 hours away. They came a week later to pick it up. They called about 4 days later to say that it was a hardware problem and the part had to come from Apex. The estimated time is 4-6 weeks. It is so not worth the money. Please beware. I disregarded all the warnings and bought it anyway, thinking well it won't happen to me. Ha."
3,"Great Picture, unreachable service center!","Bought my tv in August 2003. Been very pleased with picture, sound quality, and price. Had developed problem with closed captioning. Contacted service department twice in same day and told they would return my call (gave my number). Been two weeks and have yet to here from anyone. Posted e-mail on website and still no answer. This concerns me greatly! What good is a warranty if no one responds to your request for help! Would I buy again---at this time I don't think so!! The extra $500 in cost would have been worth the piece of mind."
3,seasick and frozen,"I love travel books and so picked this up to do my vicarious summer vacation. I thought his observations about Iceland were wonderful, and made it seem somewhere reasonable to visit. However, the graphic scenes of seasickness made me glad not to be on that part of the voyage! Some of the British slang was beyond me, but all in all a good summer read."
1,"I really wanted to like this book, but...","... I could only suffer through 17 pages before putting it down for good. The prose seemed deliberately obfuscated and gossipy, and the way it was presented was so far from compelling that I had to read the back cover to figure out what he was droning on about.Now if the book delivered what the back cover promised, that would have been great. And maybe it did. But I found myself easily distracted and completely without any understanding of what he was talking about.Maybe if I was English, some of the names and places would have been more familiar. So I can't recommend this book, even though it sounds like it would have been fascinating, to hear reviewers tell it."
4,Informative and Straightforward,"This textbook is helpful in terms of the basic principles in the the field of nonverbal, human communication. The chapters are divided into easy to understand categories of body language such as physical appearance, eye behavior, touch, space and territory etc. Subsequent chapters involve a more quantitative, holistic, and practical approach such chapters devoted to: female-male, supervisor-subordinate, intercultural nonverbal relationships. The research presented is also current."
3,Bought for school,I did not enjoy this book; I thought it was very abstract and I didn't learn much of practical use from it or from the college class I took that required it.
2,"Maybe 2 1/2 stars, but no matter... boring.","I bought the book because the instructor required us to have it for the Nonverbal Communication course. Boring! I might have learned a few new words, and understand a little more of the process of nonverbal communications, but I would much rather have read a book written differently."
1,You ain't gangsta you a b@#ch with a beat!,"Crime mob? Give me a break. What kind of crime are you committing in your stilletos? This is ridiculous, IQ lowering, inbred, country, porch monkey, southern crunk krap! Why would you listen to something that you know is going to make you dumber and in the same breath set black people back 100 years. It is insulting for people of the world to see your videos and think all black people are like you. The beats on this album are corny, the lyrics sound like my seven year old wrote them, and the hooks give me the craps. Please stop rapping and pursue a promising career at target."
1,go back to crunk college,I can tell these guys aren't coming back. The whole Im a thug thing has gotten way out of hand. Hope they had fun because it's over for Crime Mob.
3,crime mob has good album.,"crime mob has good album. its gets 3 out of 5. Good tracks like knuck,if you buck, put your hands up and Ain't No Joke."
5,The South Stays Crunk,If you all about gettin' crunk and gettin' loose in the club or you just like music from the dirty south then this is the cd for you. From track 1 to track 12 the beats are bangin and so are the lyrics. This young group is very talented and not to mention the producers who put together this album. I've been in the club when their single came on and everybody just got crunk. Buy this and you definitely will get your money's worth.
2,DOES THIS HELP?,"Dance to it: 10Weirdness: 3Catchiness: 6Originality: 1Abrasiveness: 2Self Indulgence: 10Experimentation: 1Desperation: 10Believability: 8Darkness: 10Hardcore-ness: 10Cover Art: (pirated copy)Genre Purity: 10Offensiveness: 10Accessibility: 5Notes: Very grimy poor-boy approach to the ""crunk rap"" style popularized by Lil Jon (no clear affiliation). Its strength is in the dark beats and the high-paced reckless vocal approach, but its weakness is in the low budget inconsistent engineering, and monotonous chorus lyrics. I bet a lot of clubs are scared to book them."
1,Nah........,"Here is anotha young crunk group that just came out similar to dem franchize boyz. If i had to pick, franchize boyz has a better cd. This cd is garbage, there aint even one song u can just bobb yo head too. its just like throw this S**T out the window. I got it from a friend so i couldnt do that, i just gave it back. but i wonder why he gave it to me in the first place.....? This is garbage.....GO BUY THAT TUPAC CD PEACE!!!!!"
2,Loud Music,"These people are all young I believe they are 16-19.I dont believe the women were that good.It is deffinantly loud.The lyrics are not much and the beats are above average.""knuck if you Buck""-""if you got Ana"".This sounds a little like 3-6 Mafia but the Mafia is better.""Ellenwood Area""-now this one has a banging dark beat.""Put yo hands up"" has a dark beat.As you go on and on it is obvious there trying to be 3-6.Lyrics-4/10 Production-8/10 X Factor-6/10 Classic-5/10 Replay-4Total=5.5 out of 10 Fingers"
1,sucks,"crime mob may be the worst sound i've ever heard. Their awful ridiculus lyrics left me puzzled and wanting to hurt them, and myself. I truly beleive that they are just kidding and are not really this bad. This is the worst music i have heard. Do not buy this CD and if you already have, I pity you and hope that you throw it away immediately. Knuck if you buck could be possibly one of the worst concepts for a song ever. The lyrics constantly repeat the phrase knuck if you buck and say the word hoe about 93 times. If you are looking to kill yourself listen to this song."
5,crunk,yo i don't know where ellenwood area really is or none of that but(but now i really wanna know from seein' that otha review) this cd is off tha chain it's crunk all tha way thru even that joint that's pose to be for the ladies called Diggin' Youbut if u like crunk muzik go and get this joint it's way better than dem franchize boyz first albummy hardest track on here is F*** N*gga and ellenwood area errbody rap style on that track is off tha chain
2,Kind Of Wack,This Cd is Garbage but some of the tracks are greatThe best track is Knuck If You Buck. The beat of that track is excellent.Overall I gave it a 2++I like the Atlanta Football team but not this group
4,Good Debut...,"I think this is a good debut album for this group. There are about 5 or 6 solid tracks and thats great for a debut album. The dark beats and delivery are the best part of this group. One thing to do to make this group better would be to cut back on the girls rapping as much as they do. After awhile they get kind of annoying. Other than that, I think they have a good career ahead of them. It's worth givin these guys a listen."
3,nice big bag,"I had this originally issued to me awhile back ago. I was able to keep the smaller bag that goes with it and recently purchased this new bag. Unfortunately, it is not able to connect the 2 bags together again. This is a pretty good bag other then that. I like the separate compartments in the main bag for the sleeping bag. However, I was hoping to be able to use it as a set again, so for that, I was disappointed."
4,The jury's out on this one,"Based on the rave reviews and sound clips from the band's website, I bought this CD and popped it in yesterday. My first impression was that the backbeat was more 80's revival than 21st century electronica which gives this avantgarde group a somewhat dated sound. The lead singer's voice is sweet but not as powerful like the leads in Evanescence and Lacuna Coil. Occasionally the music drowns out the singer entirely, though that might be a production flaw. Their music can't be put in one category and there's quite of experimentation going in the album to make listening an interesting experience. But after one sitting, I'm not sure whether I like the album or not. The lyrics are fab though and hopefully over time this group will win me over. This album is definitely for the open-minded. Ideally, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars for now but 4 is fair."
4,"Good puzzles, answers could be better","This is a very nice book! I used it to increase the SQL level of my employees. We did two puzzles a week, and compared our answers. And it sure helped. But there are some buts in this story. First, the puzzles are not always defined well, so you do not know what to do before you see the discussion in the answer part. Second, a lot of the solutions are not very good. Whenever I found a better one, I mailed Joe Celko. Every time he replied to me (very nice!) that somebody else also pointed it out and that there were even better solutions that mine. This means that the solutions are not always that good in the book. But still, it has alo of good brainteasers. But try them first yourself before looking to the answers as your answer could be better."
2,"Interesting book, but how hard would it have been to include the source code?","I just started reading this book and the puzzles are challenging and interesting. However, it would have been nice if someone would have taken the trouble to create sample database scripts, with sample data. That would make solving the puzzles much more fun and less labour intensive. A model for this would be the excellent websites where SQL problems are presented with table variables and a small script to create the table in both TSQL and Oracle.This omission drops my grade a full 2 stars from 4-star to 2-star."
1,SQL Noise,"I agree with ""online shopper""; these puzzles do not present anything out of the ordinary for a day-to-day SQL programmer. If you are looking to learn some basic principles and patterns, this book will definitely satisfy you. If you are looking to be stymied and actual beat your head against the wall, you bought the wrong book. I ended up selling my book within a week."
1,"Who said ""puzzles""? ;-)","A marketing slogan at the back of the cover says ""This little collection of puzzles is something to bash your head against while waiting your SQL epiphany"". A little bit too promising.The problems in the book look very much like typical problems that I have to solve at work every day. Any mid-level SQL developer could probably write a book of the same kind and usefullness by just logging every problem they solved at work for a period of a year. For this reason, if you did a lot of SQL work, you won't find anything useful in this book.If I am presented a puzzle, I expect it to look impossible to solve at first, and once you get on track of finding a solution, solving it would turn out to be a lot of fun. The ""puzzles"" in this book are not like that.As other reviewers already noted, the answers are a bit disappointing, too. I sent the book back to Amazon within a day. I'd rather spend $5 on return shipping than $30 on a worthless book."
3,No Surprises,"This book achieves its objective. I had not done simulations for years, and this book walks you through the process of learning Arena. It starts out simple--even without actual computer models, just a manual process. It moves through simple high-level, pre-coded models, and then adds complexity. All told, if you work your way through the book, you will understand Arena, a widely used programming language. Note, however, that the student version of the software in this book can only manipulate 15 entities. That's okay for learning, but for real production simulations to answer real questions, then you would need the professional version. That, of course, costs thousands of dollars. Your company would buy this. So, you see where I'm going: if you don't work in an environment that uses Area professionally, all the stuff you learned that is Arena-specific is, well, like memorizing baseball statistics. A nice hobby, but..."
3,Poorly Written,The book is way too wordy. Who has the time to read on and on to figure out even smallest of the issues like errors after running the compiler to execute the file. I do not know if there are alternatives. I did not have one as my prof highly recommended it for course proceedings. It is a stupid's giude explaining all abc's unnecessarily. This book is a absolute hassle for mini course takers in this subject or learner's on the fly.
4,"Fine book, but not the best value","You are better off buying the author's larger book, Combination Challenge. This one is fine, but if you plan to buy the larger one eventually, you are better off finding a different book of simple tactics. For that, maybe Seirawan's Winning Chess Tactics, Chernev/Reinfeld's Winning Chess, a Pandolfini book, or even Simple Checkmates for the rudiments.But if you're on a budget and you want only 1 book, this is a very good one."
4,Good Tactics Workbook for the Advanced Beginner to Intermediate Player,This is not just a tactics workbook for juniors! It is useful for anyone wanting chess tactical problems to solve that are not too easy and not too hard! I like chess tactics workbooks and books that cover opening traps to learn the tactics in the openings as well.Recommended.
5,the second time is the charm,"I recently bought the kindle and when trying to decide what my first money purchase should be I went with John Norman one of my favorite writers and his three most recent gor novels. I had read Witness awhile ago and did not remember much about the book but on a second reading I found Witness to be a truly great book with enough action and romance to equal the classic Gor books of old. JN has an ability to bring locals to life and Treve is a fine example, a city deep in the mountains that is only accessable through the air. The sense of wonder that JN brings to his Gor novels has kept me coming back for 25 years and I hope that there will still be a few more Gor books to be published in the future."
2,not his best,Personally i did not care for the book at all. I found it very slow and tedious. It was written from the slave's point of view and went on and on about the same thing over and over again. It lacked action and interest. I would not recommend it at all.
1,What a waste,"I have read all of the Gor books. When he writes about the action he is great but when he writes about the male female relationships it gets boring. I mean we have read the same thing in all of the books, we get it already. He has dragged this story out for 5 books as is. To not progress the story line at least a little further was stupid. I waited 14 years for this crap!!!!! Just end the story already. If he thinks the reason he got another chance to complete the story was because of the slave/master relationships in the book he is wrong. I admit there are some devoted readers that love that(based on the sale prices for Slave Girl) but most of us like the political plotting and sword play. Oh well. Maybe the next book will take place in AR."
2,None,80% commentary and 20% story line. I have read the entire series and found this book boring and long-winded. I hope the Cabot story will be returned to soon.
3,Somewhat disappointing,"After finally reading this book I was somewhat disappointed by Mr. Norman's writing. He had ""Janice"" repeating things numerous times throughout the entire book. I own every single Gor book in the series and have to say that this was the worst one as far as keeping the readers attention to what happens next. I can normally finish one of his books in 2-3 days but this one took me a month! I certainly hope the next one is much better written. One neat thing that is in the book is the Gor website. Definately for the Gor fan wether you are the master or kajira."
1,Witness of Gor? LOL,"I have been a fan of the Gor series since the beginning. I have all original paperbacks with dustcovers intact. My favorite being Magicians of Gor; I waited and waited for number 26 to surface, wrote the author numerous times and just simply forgot about it. Then one day, email arrived: Witness of Gor is available for purchase. Woot! Book 26...Boy o boy was I ever disappointed. The female slavery-bondage, ok, fine. toss it in, but this book is so similar to the other one: Slave Girl of Gor. I wanted to see what happened to Tarl and his one true love Talena, his adventure with Marcus, Vela his 2nd true love..I was disgusted with this book. It sits on the shelf beside the other 25, but I won't read it again. Once was enough. Actually, once was one time too much."
3,"Great, while it worked","I have had this machine for less than a year. It broke. I brought it in for warranty repair, and was told that it is a maintenance issue, and not covered. WTF?? Isn't that what a warranty is for? Buyer beware. Hoover is no help, and their service reps are well trained to not allow any work go through the warranty. They know they will not get paid, and easier and faster to get a check from you. Good luck..and get another brand."
5,Great Carpet Cleaner,"This product was recommended to me by my cousin and I have no regrets. It is lightweight,easy to use, easy to care for,and very reasonably priced. The Hoover Solution was much better than others I have used in the past.Definately recommend it 100%."
1,Disposable,"It's lighweight for one of these things, but leaves carpet damp. I was ok with that trade-off, because I used it very little.But shortly after a year of light use one of the internal hoses split. Past the warranty cutoff, so hoover won't help. Machine is unusable and repair as expensive as new one.This is an internal hose that gets no wear; it split because of design flaw or defect. If you get this, don't expect it to dry your carpet and don't expect it to last very long."
4,Lightweight and easy to use,"I purchased this carpet cleaner because of the ""lite"" in it's name. I have a neuromuscular disorder and can't push around heavy things very long. I was very pleased with how easy it was to use and how light it was. So many machines are so heavy you can't move them anywhere after the water tank is filled. I was surprised how clean my carpets were after one use. I would definitely recommend it. I only gave it four stars because the plastic water containers have plastic latches. They may break at some point if you are not careful."
1,Go with the 5200 series instead of Agility/Lite,"This machine does nowhere near the cleaning job of the 5200 series. I think the problem is an engineering issue - with the weight of the water tanks on the back of the machine, over the wheels, instead of over the brushes and suction in front, there's not enough contact with the carpet to suck out the water, and the brushes aren't effectively engaged. I solved this (partially) by tying a brick onto the front. I notice another reviewer pushes down on the front while his wife runs the machine. But my old 5200, which lasted for years, had much better suction as well as brush action. So only buy the Agility if you can't handle the slightly heavier weight of the 5200 machines, because it does a very poor cleaning job and leaves the carpet very wet, which, with time, might be damaging to the carper."
1,Don't buy it!,"I purchased this machine a a little over a year ago, I didn't use it very long before the hose that carries the water to the tank tore in half. I ordered a new hose back in August 2007, and still haven't received anything, customer service has not been helpful at all. Just one frustration after another. Save yourself a big headache and don't even deal with Hoover!"
4,Good Machine,"I am very happy with this machine, cleans carpet very well easy to lift and the handle folds down, so you have more storage options. Also easy to clean after use. At first I found the storage tanks awkward to use but that is no longer the case in fact just the opposite, they are extremely easy to fill, empty and clean The price was right too under $100.00 It does leave the rug a little wet wet though, so if you live in a humid climate I would not recommend it, but here in the southwest I have not found that to be a problem."
2,doesnt suck,This cleaner does not pick up any water. I had a Bissel that was wonderful but for a cheaper price I picked this one up. Now I am disappointed I wondered if I was doing something wrong but after reading the reviews saw other people had the same problem. I expected more from a Hoover.
1,COLD cleaning & soaking wet carpets,"Not anything like I hoped. Unfortunatly, it was purchased just a little over 1 yr ago, so can't return/exchange it. It wasn't used at all until last month, 1st time I actually had to use it since purchase, & i'm VERY disappointed. The water comes out ice cold, not steam vac as stated even on product. No matter what I do, even putting hot water in from microwave, water is still ice cold. Dosen't do well cleaning just simple stains, & even after going over carpets 2 to 3x, it just dosen't do well at sucking up most water, took forver to dry.Wish I would've used it right away so I would've known its not worth even $50, & I payed over $100 cuz now I'm stuck with a worthless machine."
4,Easy to use,"I got this cleaner at a great price while it was offered as a lighting deal. It arrived very quickly and I am very pleased with the job is does. However, I only give it four stars because after only two uses one of the plastic latches snapped off the water container with no abuse or force. I don't think that was a very well thought out concept in the design. While the latch is no longer intact, the water container still holds into place. My only other complaint is that the carpet cleaner does not stay separate from the water like other Hoover cleaners. It is mixed in directly with your cleaning water, so if you don't use all of the water in one cleaning it goes cold and is a bit of a waste."
3,"Even with 12 amps, it doesn't extract enough water","It leaves too much water in the carpet. So, while my wife operates the water discharge lever on the handle, I push down on the suction/vacuum to create a better contact thereby helping the unit suck out the water.My wife also has arthritis in her hands which makes it impossible for her to manipulate the water tanks.I'm not sure the unit heats the water prior to expelling it from the machine.I tried the upholstery cleaning attachment and it seemed to do a good job.You get what you pay for."
2,Shame on Hoover,"I bought this product on Amazon a little over a year ago. At first I was thrilled with its lightweight easy function. However, it leaves the carpets really wet (I just compensated by putting a ten pound weight on top for deeper suction. I think because it is so light it really doesn't do a great job of cleaning and the brushes are a pain to clean. The plastic tabs on the containers will absolutely eventually break off...I am missing two of four. Now the liquid dispenser won't work and it is not a fixable item. I kept it in its own closet and only used it about once a month. I am really disappointed with this plastic hunk of junk!"
4,The right price.,"Last year my 80lb American Staffordshire Terrier was a fire chief. This year he's gonna be Batman. He looks great in the costume, which came just as pictured. He hates the bat ears piece, but his ears do that naturally, anyway, which is why he's Batman...Anyway, the price was right, and the costume's fun. The materials used are the same ones you find Batman costumes for children made out of... some synthetic fabric.I loved the fire chief outfit, because it doubles as a rain coat... alas, this one doesn't.Still, it's cool."
2,wasn't the best in the series,"I read all the others in this series and enjoyed them, thoroughly. Yet, this one left me wanting. The characters were flat and steriotypical. The action seemed forced. The entire book is of running, running, running. Same scenes over and over, just in a different location. There are brief injections of the vampires and werewolves, but only very, very brief. The demons are also flat and are left with the impression of them being completely evil. Which we learned in ""A Darker Crimson"" was not the case.Overall, I found it a disappointment. I even had to force myself to finish the book, just so I would know what was going on in the next. Hopefully, the next author picks up the strings and delivers something with more action and more well rounded characters."
2,Loved the series---this rape/bondage episode's the weak link,"Sorry, rape and bondage themes are never going to be on my favorites list, even if it's for a ""good cause."" This story had some great ideas, but seriously---the victim falling in love with her would-be rapist is just gross."
3,Felt that the characters were weak and lacked character,I was expecting great things from this book due to the great ratings other readers gave it. The story felt very shallow and the characters were very weak and wishy-washy. I have read all of the other crimson city books so far and felt that this book was the weakest. I have really been enjoying this series.
1,"Not the best ""Crimson"" book","I've enjoyed the previous ""Crimson City"" books, but this one is not a good one. While I like that the protagonists are unique and not your typical romance hero or heroine, they were a bit stereotypical in their own right. But really my major dislike about this book was that it included a rape scene where the woman eventually enjoyed it. Without giving too much away to the reader who still wishes to read this book, the rape is ignored and turns into a positive plot characteristic. This isn't BDSM or even the old ""dominant man/submissive woman"" sex reminiscent of old romances; this is *clearly* a rape scene, named so by the victim. It's the real thing. Enough said."
3,"Very good, but lacking compared with the others in the series","I found this book enjoyable to read, but it lacked the ""punch"" the other books in the series had. It was difficult for me to constantly have to try and wrap my tongue around the heroine's name, Xiao Fei. Otherwise it was good. I'm still looking forward to the next and final installment, ""Crimson Rogue."""
3,It started with a BANG! and ended in a BUMP!!,"I love the crimson series, there a great read. This book on the other hand started with a bang. It was funny and had all the characters in place and then it went down hill. The vamp and werewolves where barely mentioned and the demon world was the only thing really mention about the demons except the fight sceens. It was mostly about the two main character, which is ok but some of the dialoge was very tiring to read. I found myself wanting the book to end quick. The chapters seemed long and drawn out. I was tired of reading it by the end."
4,Seduced by Crimson - back cover,"Seduced by Crimson -by Jade LeeLong ago Los Angeles became Crimson City, a glittering metropolis and sometime-battleground-sometime-home for humans, werewolves and vampires. Before that, demons ruled. And with the Crimson Veil now torn asunder, those demons are on their way back.There exist those who oppose the Dark Ones: mystics attuned to the earth, the druids. From San Bernadino they come, sending one of their mightiest-their Draige-Uisge. He can shape energy, twist it to harm or heal. But he must have something to bend, and the requisite power can be summoned by one method alone...and from one source: the beauty Xiao Fei, the Phoenix Tear. Her blood is the key, along with her ecstasy; her union with Patrick means salvation. Yet in a world of vampires, werewolves and evil untamed, even a kiss can be deadly. Opposition lurks in every shadow, peril in every caress...and both redemption and oblivion lie in one woman being...SEDUCED BY CRIMSON."
4,Mono vs stereo,"I haven't figured out how to hook it up to be in stereo. However, for a TV that cost me [not very much] brand new, it has an excellent picture quality."
5,Powerful Music,Great music from a great film. Listening to it evokes all of the emotion and power of King Arthur and his knights of the round table.
5,An Excaliburating Soundtrack.,"As he would do 18 years later with ""Merlin"" and 19 years later with ""CLEOPATRA,"" Trevor Jones has crafted a marvelous and magical score for John Boorman's epic take on the legend of King Arthur. Very well written. Of course, the most well known piece is ""The Siege Of Camylarde"" which uses ""O, Fortuna"" by Carl Orff, but there's much more magic to be heard. The love theme for Lancelot and Guinevere is also beautiful to listen to. If you loved the movie, you'll love the soundtrack. Mr. Jones really captures the spirit of the Middle Ages, especially with Igrayne's Dance, A Dance At The Court Of King Arthur & Camelot. BUY this soundtrack and ""Merlin"" together, as they complement each other. You shan't regret it. I also recommend his commanding and sensual score for ""CLEOPATRA.""Minor complaint: the end credits music is not included on the soundtrack."
1,Fluffery and Puffery,"Lovemarks is the single most inane book on advertising published in years. It epitomizes the industry at its worst: in love with trappings yet free of substance. Most ridiculous assertion: that Saatchi & Saatchi, which is synonymous with advertising mediocrity, is an ""ideas company. That says it all."
2,Lost interest,Barely read a few chapters and had already lost interest. This book has been sitting near my bed for almost half a year now collecting dust.
5,Fantastic!,Perfect insight into the unordinairy customer service experience and phenomenon of word of mouth marketing. A must read for any business owner!
4,creative book,Enjoyed the book and unique format made it a breeze to read. Probably better suited for marketing professionals or business owners in retail.
1,Warm and Fuzzy..But Still Waiting,"This was nice and warm and fuzzy book, but like a lot of other business books, there isn't anything to get your hands on other than ""We're Great.""Tom Brown - Psychologist - Michigan"
2,Get if from your local library.,"I would not recommend buying this book. As the other reviewers have already stated; the writing is over zealous and self promoting. If you can manage to get passed that you will find the ideas presented in this book insulting; the foundation for the promotion of lovemarks is, ""human beings are powered by emotion, not by reason,"" which if you have ever seen a skyscraper, flushed a toilet, flipped a switch to turn on a light or used any other product of man's reason you would find this assertion wholly false.Kevin Roberts does not succeed in this book because he treats consumers as mindless kids in a candy store who have no volitional control of their consciousness. If you believe that, then you will find this book entertaining and reassuring. If you value reason and sound advertising, then you will find this book daunting and outright irresponsible."
1,Absolute Drivel by Advertising Hucksters,"A slapdash mix of jibberish, jargon, common sense, contrived inspiration and a 20 lb bag of manure...welcome to Lovemarks by Kevin Roberts, A.G. Lafley.In today's world, your product or service had better be more than just hype and clever technique. Even better, it ought to come with a market-changing innovation-this book falls extremely short of these baselines. In fact, this book has all the substance of an Ikea coffee table: It looks good on the surface, but underneath it all, it is just cheap filler.The authors of this book are admen, professional hucksters. Somehow, they managed to convince a group of pseudo-intellectuals to publish this drivel. If you want to learn about branding, then read a marketing textbook by Kotler. It will cover marketing and branding in an objective and honest way. If you want to read the scatological, phony insight of an adman then buy this book.This book is, in a word, AWFUL!!!"
2,Damaged,"This book came to me bent in the corners on the back and slightly damaged. The description says ""new"" but that was definitely not the case!"
4,solid examination of classic children's literature,"In this excellent overview, Lurie points out the subtle ways that many classic children's authors such as Barrie, Burnett, Milne, Nesbit, and Carroll embedded social criticism within their stories. Lurie has a smooth, intelligent style, and a refreshing dry wit that sets this book apart from much literary criticism. My only complaint is that I would have preferred a bit more focus on the subversive texts themselves, rather than on the life stories of their authors; but then, I'm not too fond of biographical criticism as a whole. All in all, highly recommended."
5,Review of The bed and breakfast star,"I read this book when I was younger, and I absolutley loved it. I'm 15 now, and I still have to say this is probably the best book I have ever read. I love all the titles by Jaqueline Wilson, but this one is my favourite. Probably because this story covers all emotion. It is at times sad, but others very funny. The main character is great, and Jaqueline Wilson captures the emotion perfectly. You can see the character clearly in your head. If this is an adult reading this review, considering buying it for a child, do! This is an excellent book, and even if your child does not like reading they will find it very hard to put this book down!"
2,Not even a good reference book.,"This book is difficult reading at best. The author is constantly quoting from numerous studies and tossing around all kinds of (often superfluous) numbers & percentages. As a textbook it is a complete failure. However since the book covers a number of studies, you would think it might be useful as a reference book. The problem is that reference books should not contain the extreme liberal feminist bias that this author uses to color every page. If your professor requires you to read this book, I'd advise you to find another professor."
3,Originals Preferred,"Some of these remixes work nicely, others less so, but none equals the original version in sonic complexity, lyric wit, or -- curiously enough -- danceability. Best is Felix da Housecat's recreation of ""Je t'aime melancholie""; also likeable are the remixes of ""Californie,"" ""Optimistique-moi,"" and ""Libertine"" -- her very first hit single (1986) and one that she herself has frequently re-arranged (including as a power rock song, on the LIVE A BERCY cd). Much less succesful are the new versions of ""Pourvu qu'elles soient douce,"" ""Sans contrefacon,"" and ""L'ame-stram-gram."" As for Thunderpuss's remix of ""Desenchantee,"" I disagree with Woofbear; the sonic overkill of the remix -- overkill is a Thunderpuss specialty -- squashes all the subtlety, and almost all of the disillusionment, out of Farmer's original -- and a Farmer song without subtlety is like Gerard Depardieu without a nose.Note to Woofbear: ""Desenchantee"" appears on 1991's L'AUTRE, not on the 1988 CD AINSI SOIT-JE."
4,TOO FUNNY,The squirrels have figured out how to use this but not in a very efficient way-I must say I do get a kick out of them falling off but they have also figured they can wrap themselves around the feeder and hold on-the issue they can't feed. The birds love this feeder as well as the other one I got-more beauty in the kingdom and I love to get up to the birds in the morning. They keep coming all day. Droll Yankees YCPW180
4,droll yankee whipper bird feeder,"I purchased this whipper bird feeder and have been disappointed that the squirels managed to grab into the holes where the seeds come out and hang on until they are full, which never seems to happen."
4,Happy with purchase.,"I bought this feeder because the individual perches allow several birds to feed at one time. No cumulative weights. It took two - three weeks for the birds to adjust to it. The cardinals do not seem to like it that much but they will feed from it. The springs in the feeding arms make a tapping noise when the cardinals fly off. This does not happen with the smaller birds. It is fun to watch squirrels, dove, and blue jays drop off the perches when they release. The large tube is great for being away for a day or two."
4,Droll Yankee Whipper Bird Feeder,"Bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas to replace an old, cheap feeder. We get lots of squirrels and I wanted one that kept them away. When we first hung it, the squirrels could climb up the shepherd's hook that it was on, stretch out, grab the feeder with its front legs and eat the seed. Then we got a long bracket, ( longer than the stretch of the squirrel), nailed it to a tree in our yard, and so far, the squirrels cannot get to it."
3,Expensive but truly squirrel proof feeder,"We have had success keeping squirrels out of our birdseed with this feeder, but some undesirable larger birds, namely Grackles, are able to get seed.This is not the only Droll Yankee feeder that we own and we have found that the spring mechanism in the tines is prone to failure. They will however replace the broken parts free of charge."
3,Expensive bird feeder,Squirrels have stayed off of it however I have not seen them attempt to jump on it. Birds do not flock to it but do not know why!
5,Great Bird Feeder,I have this one and another Droll Yankees bird feeder. I am quite happy with them that I ordered this one as a birthday gift for a backyard bird lover. He's been enjoying the birds and likes that the squirrels can't get any bird seed.
2,expensive mistake,"Birds in my yard did not like this feeder at all. I think they found the perches uncomfortable, it was expensive and a huge waste of money for me."
2,Impractical,"Very heavy and will not stand securely when filling; also, sunflower seed falls out when birds feed and is on the ground, defeating purpose of swing away perches. Not recommended"
4,Another great feeder from Droll Yankees,I bought this feeder after my Flipper bit the dust (a bear climbed up on my back deck and knocked it to the ground). I got the Dipper first to replace the Flipper (this is sounding silly already) and highly recommend it! I like the Whipper too and the Cardinals actually prefer the curved perches over the post perches on the Dipper. I gave this one 4 starts and not 5 because one squirrel has already figured out how to defeat the larger curved perches and get to the seed. The Dipper has been 100% squirrel & Blue Jay proof.
5,A gift for my sister,"I gave this to my sister who is an opera lover, and she adores it. She had tried without success to find one of the Wagner operas with Deborah Voigt, and I was lucky enough to find this, which she says fills her need to hear the voice of Voigt. I have found other rather obscure operas at Amazon, and if even I, a computer illiterate can find them, it's easy!"
2,Less well than expected,"I originally have great hopes for this recording. Unfortunately, it turns out to be quite a disappointment.Much as I admire Domingo, I must say that he is not very idiomatic for the part of Siegfried, even if he sings with considerable musicianship. The style just isn't right, and there're some audible strain at the top notes.Voigt just hasn't got the stentorian tone for Brunnhilde and Isolde. Yes, she sings quite beautifully, but her top notes, while accurately placed, lack force and power. She doesn't convince the listener that she can be an imperious Valkyrie or an ardent lrish lover.The orchestral accompaniment is good, but not exceptionally so.I would award this recording 2 stars."
1,A great disappointment,"Though I admire Domingo, I must say that this release is, to me, a big disappointment. Domingo's voice is quite unsuited to Wagnerian music drama, and his effortful, not to say unidiomatic, delivery of both the vocal lines and the text is really not very appealing.I have even more reservations with Voigt, whose wiry tone and generalised singing fail to do any justice to the music of Brunnhilde and Isolde.All in all, a forgettable release."
2,Unsuited to their parts,"I can only say that both Placido Domingo and Deborah Voigt are unsuited to the roles of Tristan and Isolde, Siegfried and Brunnhilde, and such unsuitability shows in this recording. No doubt both a fine musicians, but they really are vocally and stylistically out of their depths here."
3,Could have been better,"This was an o.k. movie for me and I like most all westerns.The acting was fair.I liked the cast.I liked the story line but not the direction that it sometimes went.For starters,the movie portrayed the U.S. Calvary as a bunch of bumbleheads.I just believe they could have done better(more indians)(better shooting),especially with the acting power of Rory Calhoun.On a scale of 1-5 the transfer is maybe a 3.5 as the whole movie is a little grainy.With that said-if you can get for the right price,its worth a watch or two..........support your favorite artists.........."
5,The Future Is Now,"This is an utterly enchanting release, which merges the voices & musical instruments of Bachir Attar and the Master Musicians of Jajouka with the electonica vision of Talvin Singh.Singh utilizes a vast landscape of clubland beats, but the selections never stray from the warmth and rhythms of the Master Musicians.While the focus is on the folkloric history passed down through generations, the production points to the future through intelligent production and a presence of mind to truly let the music do the talking."
2,lost potential,"Both T.Singh and B. Attar are too timid on this cd. They tiptoe along trying not to ""step on"" the ethnic vitality of the Jajouka Musicians. While there are moments of brillance the cd feels unfinished at best, psychotic at worst. Neither the cuts or cd (as a whole) have any kind of flow. Either take the traditional music to a modern level or just leave it all traditional! They should take a hint from the fellow who remixed the wonderful bonus track...""the magic of peace""..."
5,Classic 50's Spanish Movies,"Recently, we introduced my grandparents to the world of DVD's. As Spanish Speaking only individuals, I had been trying to get them Spanish Movies on DVD. They love all the Sarita Montiel movies from the 50's. They remember getting dressed up to go to the cinema in Cuba and the movies really take them back. These two for one DVD's are great and you really can't beat the price. It is a treasure trove I was thrilled to find for them on my quest to expand their DVD collection. They really take you back to a different time and let's face it, the classics never get old."
5,New fan loves the CD,"This is the only Fates Warning CD I have as of now, and this has got to be one of the greatest from any power metal band I've ever heard. Unfortuneatly I am too young to have ever remembered seeing their videos from No Exit on MTV, I had just been reccomended this CD from numorous people on the Internet. It is also amazing how band's earlier CDs are also there creepiest, especially if there were recorded in the 70's or 80's. The band's 21 minute ""The Ivory Gate of Dreams"" makes me wonder ""what happened to the energy of the 80's?"". Well I'm babbling, so I better shut up. So buy this CD!"
2,Emily's Review,"The book was alright. It was an easy read for me and not that interesting. Zeeis the main character. He and his friends are punks. They hate the merchants in their town area. Zee spray paints a wall on one of the stores. After they painted over it he did another one. It had a door with graffiti everywhere. That time someone caught him, then they made a deal.This is a young adult book (YA) the readers should be 6th grade and higher cause they do bad things and they could be a bad influence on young children. If you don't like easy short books then I suggest you don't read this. This book was not a book that I loved, or would want to read again."
3,A little disappointed,"When I saw the author on a TV interview talking about his book, I thought ""Man, this sounds really interesting and I gotta get it"". When I read the first few chapters, I felt I was in for a bit of a let down. The main character in the story was mentioned very littleand in some of the chapters, I felt I was reading a story one would find in Penthouse FORUM and not a mystery-scifi thriller. The story line needs some tightening here and there, but altogether it's not a completely unsalvageable read. There'e some real potential in Mr. McNeill's writing style."
5,Intriguing and Impressive,O'Neill has created a captivating story leading you directly behind the headlines in your morning paper. From the beginning you are into the lives of people and places so intriguing you eagerly turn the pages. A great read from a first time author who leaves you with a hunger for the next.
3,"Good concept, too predictable","The idea of bouncing to each perspective during the book-long man hunt is interesting and enjoyable. There just isn't much suspense, because it is all so predictable. If you like spy thrillers, you might like this book, but you won't be surprised at any point... except when you spot the few errors and wonder how they weren't caught before it was published."
3,"Interesting, but...","Echelon has a very interesting plot. I picked it up because I am interested about government eavesdropping: echelon, carnivore Magic Lantern, Rapid Start. However, there are too many unnecessary scenes and dialogues (such that in Chapter 14) that took away from what could have been a very good story; too many characters that I didn't care about; too many names to remember. I got to know Carolyn and Janet more than I would like and I thought they are behaving like little girls. Sarah's behavior, the wife of Michael Stone (the main character) just makes me mad. I wish she has more compassion and trust to her CIA husband. Again, this story has a very good and promising plot. But I think I would have enjoyed it better if it is written by David Baldacci or Joseph Finder, Michael Connelly, even David Morrell or Sue Grafton."
2,Sub par at best/snore fest,"I bought this book because Amazon 'suggested' I would like it after looking up Daemon by Leinad Zeraus. As an aside, Daemon is a great/highly entertaining book. This however is not. I am half way through and am forcing myself to swallow the medicine to finish. I may not. The characters are two dimensional/cookie cutters that could be found left on the floors of a choose your own adventure chop shop. The plot had promise, but too many boring character background deviations have pulled away from what seemed interesting - the government's abilities, technologies, and abuses with eavesdropping of any kind. That is sadly a sidenote to a high school level writing exercise. I may be a bit harsh - if I had picked this up out of the blue, it would probably have gotten 3 stars. Since I came off of reading a much better book - and this seemed recommended by like minds, I was let down farther."
2,"Starts Off Good, But Fast Becomes Boring","It's not that O'Neill's a bad writer -- I think he needs a lot of seasoning in his craft. Echelon tells a story about conflicting groups trying to catch some bad guys, but there are too many characters, few of which have been developed to any extent. I bought the book thinking it would tell me about Echelon, the ambitious signals intelligent program that sucks up virtually all electronic communications in the world. But the book only hints at that. The rest of the time it's one chase scene after another. I got two-thirds of the way through the book and tossed it. I just didn't care any more about the characters or the plot. O'Neill's probably got some good books in him, but this aint one."
3,Decent fiction debut with fascinating glimpse into domestic intelligence.,"The author obviously knows what he is talking about and presents a fascinating glimpse into some of the systems, scenarios, and processes for US domestic intelligence. Interesting plot and characters, but the real power comes from the ""inside"" technical knowledge. On par with Clancy's debut (Hunt for Red October), I hope the author keeps at it - his technical abilities are great; more story, character, and plot development and he could be as good as Clancy!"
3,Nelson's New Christian Distionary,"I'm in an inductive study the ""Gospel of Mark"". I couldn't find a definition for Pharisees and Sadducees. I was really disapointed since these were the first two words I looked up and could not find. I will continue to look through the dictionary, and comment further. I hope all readers note what is missing so that this work can be revised at a later time by the author."
2,Meh,"Most of the songs sound the same.After listening to the album a few times i liked one or two of the songs, but all in all, nothing inspiring."
4,Washboard is really neat!,"I purchased this washboard for my 2 yr old grandson. He absolutely loves music and instruments. I haven't tried it myself, but it looks just like the picture on Amazon, and he really likes it. It seems to be made very well for the price. I'm sure he will have lots of fun with it, both now and in the future."
5,"Great, authentic sound","It's not your grandmother's washboard - still it makes great music. Arrives with three thimbles for strumming. Used it for ""You Are My Sunshine."" Wonderful musical accompaniment. Sturdy enough to allow a toddler to play with it too."
2,Smaller than expected,This will be fine for the kids in our church. The gentleman that we got it for liked it but it is much too small for him.
4,took 2 weeks longer to arrive than they said it would...,I am not sure if it was the postoffice that delayed the arrival or the company I ordered it from. I got an email stating the musical washboard would arrive on December 20th and it didn't show up. If it hadn't been intended as a Christmas present it would have been less of an issue. I called the company and they said it was at a postoffice a couple hours away from me and I should get it soon. They also said if it didn't show up within 2 weeks to call them back and they would try to figure something out. Luckily the item arrived (although it was more than 2 weeks late) so I didn't have to call again to search for my missing item.
4,"""Death and the Life After"" by Billy Graham",It had a lot of information I was looking for. It was easy to understand and I enjoyed the large print. It made me realize we have to be prepared in this area and not to put off not talking about death. It is a part of life that we do not prepare for enough and that is a Big Mistake. It has been the best book I have read on this subject so far..
5,What the Bible tells us about the hereafter,Billy Graham is the one writer I have found who can distill the wisdom of the Bible into words I understand. This book has been my companion and a guide to the scriptures as have other of his books. Highly recommended.
5,A great book,This book has really helped me through some bad times. It has helped me prepare my soul for Heaven.
5,Learning About What Happens When A Loved One Dies and What Will Happen When I Die,"After a family tragedy, I bought every book on death, dying, and especially Heaven, that I could find.This is one of Billy Graham's older books and has some of his thoughts about Heaven.Some books were especially comforting when I just needed to know God was there to comfort me. At the time the wreck was happening, I remember saying to myself, ""So this is the day I will get to see Jesus face to face."" No, it was the day my husband got to see Jesus face to face. As I got stronger, I wondered exactly what he and my other loved ones are doing in Heaven. I just ached for more knowledge.One thing I enjoyed from this book was the part discussing the beauty of the surroundings and sounds in Heaven and how the description of the streets of gold isn't as inviting to some of us who prefer the natural beauty of mountains and countryside. This is one of my books on Heaven that I'm glad I read. I still ache to know more, of course."
5,Best middle class show ever!!!,"Best Buy already has this dvd out...exclusively. This has to be one of the realest middle class family show ever. This is real family working class situations. The actors just fit in with the characters. The best character has to be ""Uncle Eddie"". I think all middle class american families have a ""Uncle Eddie"" somewhere...I know I do. Why the network decided to cut the show beats me. You can relate with this show. Its not your fake bogus shows that nobody lives that way. Even though The Finnerty Family is Irish,it feels like any family can be like The Finnerty."
3,"Claudia spent only 1 episode ""showing""","and it was the last episode because they fast fowarded her pregnancy. I wish the writers had written the pregnancy into season 3 or 4, there could've been some funny one liners between Sean & Claudia. The series finale was disappointing, but I still bought this season (And will buy the other seasons) because ABC Family seems to only rerun it on Saturdays now."
5,Bent rods and screaming reels!,"For Many years Tom Gilmore has been a well respected authority on chasing and landing Northeast species on a flyrod. Hispublic seminars for fishing clubs throughout the east often pack a full house to Enlightened Longrodders.His Knowledge and Practical Expierience come through in this well researched book, making this comprehensive guide perfectly clear to fishermen of all skill levels who read it.This book was extremely helpful offering all pertinent information from tackle to seasonal Hotspots. If you are not yet an Albie angler read this book and you'll soon be!"
2,Could be a safety hazard,Luckily I needed a right seat replacement because these floor mats do not come with holes to snap over the floor pegs to prevent slippage such as happened with Toyota. This does not present a hazard on the right and I could have cut holes if necessary; this is the only reason I did not give them a one star.
4,Handy,"not greasy, easy to apply to face. If you are sweatinng you should reapply. Container does not leak in the heat. I keep a supply for golf and all summer activities."
2,Save Your Money,"I bought this because I'm a big Barry Gordon fan, and that did make it worthwhile viewing it once, but now it's languishing on the shelf at Goodwill. My gosh, what was Sid Caesar doing in this movie?! He must have been doing a friend a favor, because he sure was over-qualified! It's just a corny, silly mess."
5,Watched as a kid with my brother,Great old movie loved it when I was a child and it still is a great oldie but a goodie love it
2,This spirit is hardly willing.,"Somewhere along the fourth time trying to watch this, I woke up at the very end where the family is talking about another vacation and the kid suggest Scotland or something where ""they have ghosts'."" Why? Didn't he get enough being in this unfunny, atmosphereless farrago? HYSTERICAL has a similar setting and makes you laugh every 20 minutes. This thing just sits there like the brakes were jammed. Bill Castle didn't get better with age. A good cast wasted. Picture quality is adequate but hardly sterling."
3,Olive Films???,The movie itself is harmless entertainment-what concerns me is Olive Films which I have noticed over the last few months has been getting the rights to quite a few older pictures-they are releasing these without being closed captioned or subtitled and have a fairly high price on them-this is disturbing to me because along with the new fad of releasing older films on dvd-r with no sdh or subtitles is putting too many movies I would like to have unavailable to me (the dvd-r's are also overpriced for what is being offered). So it is really discouraging to find when a company is finally offering an oportunity to view the older films they are doing it no better than the dvd-r people-without regard to the MANY who need sdh or subtitles.
5,Rockford Fosgate Punch,Great Amp.... Severely Under rated.... Produces Powerful Clean Sound. Make sure to use properly rated speakers....
3,Xena - Girls Just Wanna Have Fun - IS A DVD GAME -,"Just to clarify, this DVD is a multi-path interactive adventure. Bacchus, the great God of Wine, had always been a kind and benevolent God who reveled in love and happiness--until something terribly evil happened that changed him. Bacchus has spawned an army of fanged vixens, the Bacchae. They are attacking and recruiting young village girls, and killing everybody else. You join Xena, Gabrielle and Joxer to find out why Bacchus has gone mad. Together you can stop him, before it's too late. Only you can decide Xena's possible fate."
1,"This is OK for middle school, I guess.","This is OK for middle school, I guess, but the Forms of Government Poster Set from Teacher's Discovery is a LOT nicer...and better for High School kids."
1,no.,"i dont know about anyone else who has this thing, but stay away from it. i got one not too long ago, and i was really impressed by the sound quality. i will admit, it sounds really good. the only problem with this thing is that it only sounds good for about a month. after that, it doesnt sound at all. when i put a cd into any of the 5 drives, it just makes some strange whirring noises for about a minute and then tells me that theres no cd. once in a blue moon, it'll acutally read the cd, and then you get to sit and pray that it actually plays the read cd. if you want a good sounding stereo, get this one. if you want a good sounding stereo that you can actually use for more than a month, look for something else."
3,Science too heavy for mere mortals,"I *really* wanted to love this book. I was excited when it came out because of the author's background as a *real* rocket scientist. But, after spending hours trying to understand the first two pages with the science of Collapsiums and such, and frantically flipping to the apendices, I must say the science is too much. I am a Software Engineer with a BSEE and I can't understand a word of the science. One must come equipped with an advanced physics degree it seems. However, it isn't all a total loss. The story is a typical but nice fantasy story. The theory of fax transfer of people is intriguing."
1,Huh?,"This is a strange and confusing book. People travel through space by faxing themselves to new locations. People can finally be in the same place at once. This helps people be more effective, but causes a number of problems. How does the knowledge gained by the faxes come back to the original? They all go back into the fax machine and are re-integrated.I found this book to be silly. The science was too incredulous for my taste. The characters were not developed well. I didn't sympathize with Bruno when he lost his love Tamra. The ending was trite. It was more of a magical fairy tale with confusing science."
2,Poorly written/edited,"I bought this book with high hopes of learning the finer details of rep weave, but was dissappointed. While it's true that the photographs were lovely, there was not enough in depth instruction and the innacuracies in this book drive one to distraction. You're better served going to the Handwoven website and downloading the patterns directly from there as the innacuracies have been corrected there. I don't know if there was a single pattern that didn't require some correction and feel that Interweave Press should send this book back for revision rather than selling the same innaccurate patterns."
5,"Wonderful, breeathtakingly astonishing performance","This recording of the Don Giovanni is perfect! I could expect no less of the wonderfully gifted conductor Daniel Harding. The quick tempi is perfect for dramatic purpouses, and this new, fresh, dramatic perspective is really welcome. There are some stage noises in the recording, but I will prefer always a live recording instead of cold, antiseptic studio recordings. And the quality of this recording is really, really astounding."
3,really not as bad as a critic may say,"To the reviewer saying Claire Voyant is mediocre I ask why so many reputable artists have remixed Claire Voyant on the album ""Time And Again""? Could it be the reviewer is resently about other issue such as the high price of music albums in general and not the actual album purchased? Claire Voyant may not end of up as your favorite artist, but it is certainly not as horible as this reviewer says. I would certainly recommend downloading the song ""Her"" from an online music store since the album it appears on is out-of-print, hard-to-find, and expensive."
3,FIND SOMETHING BETTER,"I've had the Stanton Discmaster II's for 2 years. They are terrible for back cueing trying to find the beat of the other record. Low sound quality as well. Scratchy.... Not clear like a stylus of that calibre is supposed to be. Anyway, I bought Ortofon Concorde Pro's! WOW....WHAT A DIFFERENCE! THAT THING WILL TAKE A BEATING AND KEEP ON TICKING! CUEING IS PERFECT, SOUND QUALITY IS AMAZING, AND THEY OVERALL LOOK BETTER THAN THE STANTON'S! I hate to bash Stanton like this but trust me DJ'S out there.... This is the honest truth! Please... go with the ORTOFON'S!DJ NICODEMUS(SC)"
3,"PLEASE, JUST LET ME PLAY THE GAME!","This kind of game is right up my alley, I love a good WW2 shooter as much as the next guy. However the steam software is obtrusive and a waste of time. It will take you up to three hours to simply download the patches and software to run this game. It gives you the option weather you want t download the Steam software, but if you say no it simply aborts the game install. I gave this game a 5 star fun review because it is realistic, with beautiful graphics and good unit detail. The unit selection is good, and it is fun to have to change out the machine gun barrells in the middle of a firefight. The overall game gets three stars because of the steam software that runs on your computer weather you like it or not. Don't expect to pop in the disk and be playing in a few minutes, it WILL take hours. Overall a fun game with an annoying attached program. Play with patience."
1,Impossible to Load,"Might be a fun game for all I know, but since you have to download something from the company websight to get past encription, and since I don't have High-speed internet, it was impossible to load (even to just play solo, which is all I wanted to do), so I basically just threw away $30. It's like 1990 all over again - remember that fun tension after buying a new game and wondering if it would work, or if you would have to spend 3 hours fiddling with com and port settings? Welcome back to the nightmare...This game is for massive online DSL junkies - for the rest of us, don't waste your money."
2,good game but way too many flaws,this is a good game but way too realistic i mean no cross hairs u die fast characters are slow and stiff if i wanted so much realism i would join the marine corp i just want to play a game this is stupid
1,RO computer experts only,"Positives reviews are coming from RO forum fanboys, they are doing this game no favours, unless you are confident editing config files you will struggle to run game,there are still many bugs, if you have Zonealarm firewall forget it. the installer wont let you install on any drive but C, if you like FPS games you wont have much fun, its more like a sim with a massive learning curve, unless your going to spend all day trying to get some teamwork going your wasting your time.You need at least 19"" monitor as anything smaller you wont stand a chance of seeing the enemy, theres only one type of gameplay (capture objective) Theres way too much artillery that kills you just as you spawn. Again if you like tactical realism try it, if you want a bit of fun give it a miss."
1,Mis-represented and bug-ridden,"Caveat Emptor! the box, and indeed this website are misleading: this game is NOT designed for single player at all and there are no ""campaigns"" or storylines. What this game is is an ONLINE game (which are sad sad shadows of the skill involved in a quality single player game) that ""offers"" you the ability to ""practice"" by yourself - practicing is not the same as playing, as there is no effective single player mode. You won't find any mention of practicing until you open the box, whereupon all mention of single-player goes away to be replaced with ""online game"" and ""off-line practice"".Apart from pretending it has a viable single-player mode when it doesn't, it's bug-ridden: freezes up, elements (like the sniper scope) don't work, drive a tank and you can't command it it move while you shoot, because you have to perform each function yourself (you're SUPPOSED to be able to tell the crew ""go here"" or ""do that"", but it doesn't work).very disappointed. Waste of $30."
5,This is it!,"This is the best realism game you can get!The gameplay just blows all other games out there, it really is unparalelled.But beware, if you are an arcade gamer (Unreal Tournament, CounterStrike, Battlefield, Medal of Honor) this game probably is nothing for you.It's too mature for arcade gamers, it also features alot of teamwork so it's nothing for the lone wolf.Another neat feature is the fact that the support is always 100%, they will add more maps, weapons and features next to bugfixes in their patches, their support is friendly and often works and I haven't seen one cheater.You do have to know how to use your rifle and tank, for instance alot of players don't know where the weak spots on various vehicles are ... and that's called realism!Don't think it's too realistic to be fun, because it's so realistic it is fun! ;)"
3,LOVE or Hate,"^. As my title says you either love it or you hate it. Personally after playing the free weekend on steam I don't like it. It is still fun BUT some of the realism takes away from the game. In some of the bigger levels you will find yourself walking for a while to get in the action along with these big levels comes the FIVE to SEVEN MINUTES to load one map. Maybe I am just not patient enough but that is pretty long. This game is for people who want a REAL LIFE breathing game. With no dot in your screen showing where you are shooting, Nades that send dirt everywhere, tanks that are unstoppable.Pro:The realism is very cool at SOME partsThe graphics are beutifalThe sound is greatCons:The loading times are insaneLaggy at menus and game sometimes and I have a very good connectionPractice Mode can be very laggy as well"
3,Not For Everyone!,"This game has a steep learning curve. Those expecting to pick up the game and start playing will be in for a rude awakening. The developers of this game placed a strong emphasis on realism. This game would be better classified as a sim than a FPS. If you like ultra realistic games, this one is for you. Beware, this game is distributed by STEAM. Once you buy this game, it's yours. At this time, STEAM does not allow the transfer of games."
4,RED ORCHESTRA OSTFRONT 41-45,NOT TOO THRILLED ABOUT THE GAME.REALLY DID NOT THE GERMAN SIDE.THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN FROM THE RUSSIAN SIDE!
3,Do you like Steam? it's what you get...,"The program Steam that we all learned to love with Halflife II is back. That's what you actually get for your money and then the game downloads from the server. Got broadband? you had better. Took me a total of 2 hours to update at 30kb. Game is good looking and runs smooth on my old GF6/256mb card with 1 GB of DDR ram. AMD 3000+ with WinXP 64bit. This is a simulation and a mature game. Quake players or BFers may want to really read about it before you buy it. Might be to realistic for some in the technical aspects of the game such as manual aiming/reloading. Realistic optics and accuracy. Worth playing but swiftly becoming boring. Online gameplay is problematic. If your ping is over 400ms, look for misery and mystery deaths."
5,Enlightening,"Easy to read and understand, but several personal stories that he includes make the book extraordinary. I have been given yet another new way of looking at the way things work, and it has lead to even greater awareness, which is ""what its all about""."
5,Brilliant!,This book describes deep mysticism like it is common sense and makes it very relevent to everyday life. Dr. Scarfalloto is both eloquent and earthy. He has taken a very complex subject and rendered it simple and practical. I highly recommend this book!
5,Old School Death Meets New School... DEATH!,"The words sick, repulsive, inhumane, and grotesque cannot even begin to describe the content of this release by Chicago's own,Broken Hope. This band is no frills, no nonsense death metal! There are none of the goth/black influences or dark vibes presented by a lot of today's bands, just splatter-happy carnage delivered by five very sick gentlemen.If you dig true death metal with no added ingredients, Broken Hope is the band for you and ""Repulsive Conception"" is one volatile album that is a must have for all metallers!"
1,Use this disc as a frisbee,"This is the band's third release and just about as lame as CANNIBAL CORPSE and DEICIDE, worse in some categories. Typical gutteral, one-dimensional, dull, over-the-top, Death Metal played with no sense of imagination or creativity whatsoever. I've heard worse but this ain't far off."
3,this cd is available for less on this site,"This CD is the CD that Dionne made with Barry Manilow in 1979 - a great CD, but no track listing was provided or other information. I purchased this on the chance that it might be a print of the other album she made in the 70's titled ""Dionne"" - since the other was available already...The Cd itself deserves 5 stars, but the lack of information to make an intelligent choice brings it down a couple of notches."
3,Eh,"This book is a little outdated, of course, but it did give me some hints. You can pretty much find the same info online now for free these days."
2,You can do better,"I feel like I wasted my time and money on this book. The only thing it has going for it is its catchy title. Unfortunately, with advice from the author like ""Whatever you do, don't buy a car today"" and ""A good trick is to detour through the drive-thru of a fast-food join and buy the saleman a soda."" I feel this book teaches you very little about how to Beat the Car Salesman unless you were born yesterday."
5,Appelstein Captures the Essence of Working with Kids,"Whether you are a professional or parent, you will benefit from the insight and pracitcal techniques Charlie Appelstein provides in ""No Such Thing as a Bad Kid."" Appelstein combines research, experience, and humor in this marvelous work on how to help kids grow and manage their problems. It is hard to believe that a book that is so easy and fun to read could be so helpful. As a therapist and staff development trainer in a residential treatment setting, I use the concepts and techniques in this book EVERY day."
3,functional,"Great organizer, but too many zippers for me. It's well constructed and light weight. Took travelling to Madrid and London to securely carry passport, ID, credit cards and money with zippers and over the head strap. Worked well."
2,not bad...,"Seems like today's generation is getting revenge on the censorship from the pastand is trying to open up all cans of worms. I guess nice cartoons with good storiesand some morals are out and crude in your face stuff is in. Some of these arereally funny, have funny situations but its not for everybody and i would'nt let youngkids see it as you have male and female full frontal...characters urinating andother weird stuff....and also the writters must be gay...cause theres a lot ofgay situations... But what would you expect from a generation of Reality show watchers.....Hope the next generation of cartoons brings back quality instead of quantity of crap."
5,"Oh God, I'm In Heaven!!!","The funniest show on the planet! The most creative, offensive show ever. If you want your sides to hurt from laughing, get this DVD now!""Foxy vs. The Board of Education"" is a classic! ""I's got to get my mystery science license!"""
5,The only way to make it funnier would be to add George Bush to the cast!,"If you enjoyed the first season of Drawn Together, you'll certainly want to add the second season to your video library.My favorite episode is ""Super Nanny"", when Ling Ling is trying to get his drivers license. That is FUNNY stuff!!If you weren't a fan of the first season, you won't like the second season (and why are you even reading these reviews?!).I personally can't wait to pick up my copy, and I'm looking forward to season three."
2,MAYBE IT'S NOT JUST FOR ME,"Hi, I am not usually embarrassed by adult humor, but this ""Uncensored"" version goes too far, I mean I did not need to see nude cartoons to enjoy this movie - on the contrary that ruined it for me and there was no ""clean"" version on the disk so i was stuck watching or trying to get through this filth. I'm sure alot of you out there will like it, but as for me. I'll pass for now. and i'll be selling mine here now."
2,Thin comedy disguised with predictable shock value,"Ok, I've watched at least 60 percent of Drawn together episodes out there. Yet i don't ever recall laughing past a grin. The characters are boxed into stereotypes leaving absolutely nothing funny to them but the obvious and predictable jokes . It has never displayed the wit of most ""adult themed"" animated shows out there. I cant see this show lasting many seasons more with the slight premise of the show. Tired stuff dawg!"
4,"Drawn Together - Nice second season, but...","Drawn together is great. I love the jokes, the puns, the straight up silliness. The only thing is I think it's missing a scene in one episode on the DVD. Other than that it's great."
4,Very funny,I always live this show because they do an day the crazyist things in shows its very funny to me
4,Excellent,"This is not the gritty 1960s Jack McDuff soul jazz you hear on albums likeDown Home StyleorTobacco Road / Do It Now. Re-entry was recorded in the 1980s.The album may have slicker production and some more modern music, such as the soft soul of ""One Hundred Years."" But organist Brother Jack has not strayed to far from the music that any music fan should know him for. Listen to the opener, ""Capt' Jack,"" or the cool blue of 'Walkin' The Dog,"" not the Rufus Thomas song, and you'll either be hooked into researching his older music, or hear the reaffirmation of his down home grits and butter.I love free jazz and progressive rock, all sorts of far reaching places, but I could listen to this southern groove all day, especially albums like Re-entry"
1,Closed minded trash,"The author should have learned more about this subject before she passed judgment on magic mushrooms. There is good reason to believe that mankind has used this kind of mushroom since we first domesticated cattle. Magic mushrooms may be the basis for all religion as we know it. Very shallow and misinformed.Any other book on this subject would be more informative. ""Clue"" if you see it listed in the (drug abuse prevention library), it's probably biased and not full of useful information."
4,"Get off your ""lame ass"" and get this one!","yeah! Hagfish finally put out a new cd! While it isnt BETTER than the first one (Rocks Your Lame Ass), it IS close! Hagfish proves to fans old and new that they still have what it takes to rock out and perform upbeat, positive songs. It's one of those rare cd's that, when you become parents one day - your kids wont make fun of! Get with it and buy this one now!"
1,More Novel Than History Source,"The book is a personal account of an American trapped in Japan after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. One expecting lengthy details on life on the Japanese home front will be disappointed. Only a very small number pages give one much information on life in Japan during WWII. To be blunt, I thought the book was pretty boring."
3,Decent case.,"I got this case for a gaming PC I was building. The picture is a little deceiving, this case is HUGE. The front door is plastic with flimsy little plastic arms holding it. The side bottom vents have fins that light up but they're held in place with fairly weak glue. One of them broke off when I was wiring it to the motherboard.All in all, it's a decent case but you can find ones that are just as good for cheaper.*Edit* I am retiring this case. If you want to build a beefy rig, look elsewhere. It does not have nearly enough air flow to cool much of anything. I have 2 8800GTS 640mb a 2.4ghz quad core and 4gb of ram and it only lasts about an hour before it shuts down due to high temps. It's a shame because it's a pretty case if you're not going to put much in it, but if you're building a gaming powerhouse, you should look elsewhere."
1,Don't buy this case,"The door of the front is beatifull but only works for 3 moths and later case in the bulk and anything solution posible , beware this case, the others reviews say is marvelous only the first moths"
3,A. Ginsberg,"This isn't an in-depth look at Mr. Ginsberg's life by any means. It's more of a picture book, text dominated by photos, some great photos. That being said, there are several kernals of gold to be mined from the text as well."
3,screaming with joy: the life of allen ginsberg,"Great photographs...but the woman in the picture on page 98 (seated between Ginsberg and Tim Leary) is incorrectly identified as ""Mrs. Leary"". She is, in fact, Peggy Hitchcock."
4,Bio Pin Ball 60 Count Small,Good product for the price. Excellent size to use in nano reef tanks. I'm very pleased with how I'm able to use this product in my tank.
5,A classic synopsis!,"This book's endurance--it first appeared in 1954--is a testament to its excellence. Few if any introductory church history texts present their subject matter as concisely yet clearly as this one. Especially appealing to those who believe humanity's fall affected the mind, not just the will."
4,Good book that covers a lot,This book book covers a lot of the church history and has pictures of some of the times. Cairns does a good job connecting the times together and describing how the time periods when along. A good read that will be added to my collection.
2,Worst written and edited book I have ever read!!,"Book is the worst written and edited book I have ever read. Numerous errors, typos; Syntax that frequently defies interpretation. Frequent use of terms that are never defined. Poor maps; Useless diagrams. A real test. The editor must have been asleep on this one. What was Zondervan thinking?"
3,Basic direct-mail guide,"Mal Warick is definitely the fundraising guru, so I was hoping to learn some new tips from this read. This isn't a bad book - it's just another guide to writing your classic direct-mail piece. If you need a basic style guide, this is appropriate. However, if you're interested in taking your basic letters to the next level, I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,Don't Like The First Few Tracks? That's okay! Listen on.,"Fates Warning has been ruminating around for decades as a lesser progressive rock/metal band. In that sense, that are much like King's X. Today that means they could open for an arena rock bank, but that they probably aren't popular to tour enough by themselves, especially not arenas.Chasing Time doesn't really get moving until track 4. Many of their riffs are atonal, and do not mix well with the vocals. Frankly, sometimes it sounds to me like their guitarist had no material ready for the album so he just steps on the distortion pedal and precedes to first thing that comes to mind, rather than crafting a song. Later in their career, however, that changed."
3,Decent Hits Collection.,"This compilation of highlights from Fates Warning isn't too bad. Not a CD that I listen to that often though. Fates Warning no doubt are great musicians. Their album productions are especially a cut above what I've heard from other groups. Their best material on this album is from the No Exit and Parallels albums. The older material with the former singer is okay. Chasing Time is a pretty good starting point, but I really recommend that someone just pick up a full-length album--No Exit or Parallels. Fates Warning has never been a favorite group (their songwriting has always been just average), but there's no doubt that they are great musicians."
5,Contains the best of philosophy from both east and west.,"I have spent the last 20 years studying various philosophies, religions and psychologies and wondering how best to put it all together. This book really does it! I highly recommend it to everyone."
2,Erroneous buy,"I bought this book by a mere mistake, because it happened to stand in the same list as the Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's ""Flow"". Imagine my surprise when I discovered that they actually have absolutely nothing in common and belong to totally different mindsets. Mystical coincidences and synchronicities? No, thank you."
1,What a bummer...,"The subject ""synchronicity"" has always interested me and I am an avid self-help-books reader. I bought this book online and had it shipped all the way to Switzerland. The cover looked nice, the reviews as well. But the authors managed to present the material so unprofessionally, I could not believe how they found a publisher in this competitive market (intuition, soul-development, etc.) . Bad writing, no fun, a waste of my time and money, what a bummer."
5,Great Book Ignore Swizterland,"I agree with most of these reviews, but not the OneStar Review. He says its written unprofessionally, maybe he doesn't speak English. The book is written in a friendly way, as if someone you've known for a while is sharing something they've found out with you. And on top of that it's a good something. This ""flow"" is something I wish everyone had. It makes people happier and it adds something magical to your life. The book does a good job explaining this and it includes some good techniques to induce the ""flow"". When your in the flow you can't help but feel a certain ""oh yeah, baby"" feeling inside each time something goes right your way. Just one bad review often puts me off of a book with lots of good ones so I wanted to address that ONE for you. Why should you listen to me instead of that dude? That's obvious, Im the Coolest. Or at least me and my mama think so. Hope this helps."
4,Nice & bright!,I like the look of the LED's. Easy to install. My only nit-pick is that it would have been nice if the kit had waterproof connectors.
4,Great Kit,"I had just bought a boat. The trailer had some oldy moldy lights and a horrible chopped up wiring harness. This kit provides every needed to repair such a thing. I especially like the led lights. They totally water tight, and draw little power to operate. All in all This was a good purchase for me."
5,Sills is great; so is Gedda!,"I find it highly objectionable that the previous reviewer said that Pavarotti has a voice superior to Gedda's. Gedda's voice is ravishing at mezza voce level. His pianissimos are awesome in their beauty and they never become croons. As for refinement, Gedda is miles ahead of Pavarotti, who is so often coarse in his opera recordings. Gedda also has excellent diction in seven languages. Pavarotti's Italian is superb, but his French is not entirely idiomatic. Also, he only sang in two languages, Italian and French.As for the roles of Lucia and Sonnambula, they were written for light coloraturas, not dramatic coloraturas. The choruses are not supposed to drown out the lead soprano. Sills is perfect for both roles, even though she only sang Lucia. Also, to say that Sills is an inferior Lucia compared to Sutherland is a mistake. Sills was dynamite in that role, vocally and dramatically. Not every one cares about huge high notes and beautiful tone like Sutherland's."
5,A stunning Tour de Force,"Again Miss Sills comes across on this cd stunningly. One needs no video here to make Elvira plausible. Superb coloring of the phrase, always apparent in Sills recordings is in full force.Even though the voice is beginning to show some wear, who cares. It is exciting singing at it's best. Young singers listen up. Comparisons to Sutherland,is like comparing apples to bananas. But the real singer in this recording is Mr. Gedda. Superb all the way.Italian Bel Canto at its finest."
5,Haunting !,The glory of this set is the dramatic involvement of all the soloists and conductor. Beverly Sills and Nicolai Gedda are perhaps a bit past their best but they are still pretty impressive coping with the impossibly high tessitura with incredible gusto - their impeccable musicianship and formidable technique still very much in evidence. Louis Quilico and Paul Plishka are perhaps a little gruff for Bellini but offer sturdy performances. The score is absolutely complete and sweepinglyconducted by Julius Rudel - all in all a highly riveting set of a hauntingly beautiful opera.
2,Disappointing,This book had a lot of hype. The book was not what I expected. This is really more of how to triathlon book than anything else.The cancer and the food changes are mentioned but exercise is really the main focus. I think the regular reader would definitely have trouble relating to this book.
3,Dawn of the Death age,"Swamped in Gore is Broken Hope's first album, originally written in 1990 and rereleased by Metal Blade in '95. It fails to meet today's difficult standards of high quality death metal, but, in retrospect, this type of music started off raw and sick. If you liked Obituary's ""Cause of Death"" and enjoy the dungeon sound of Mortician, then you should enjoy this early offering from Broken Hope. With songs such as: ""Gobbling the guts,"" ""Bag full of parts,"" and the blood soaked title track, Swamped in Gore is the musical equivalent to horror film ""The Evil Dead."""
1,corny,And death metal gets stupider. Thanks to bands like broken hope.This is the worst album since that one lame poison album.
2,"A real turn off, even for a Broken Hope fan","I was really sorry to listen to this album. Joe Patteck is completely unintellegible, remembered me 80s metal bands that didn't really sing, but made some guttural noise on the mic.Better listen to the albums that follow this one, skip this one. It is simply gore to the maximum and no real talent in the music."
2,lol,its pancake face barbie its like you go to but som powder on and awwwww theres a face in my makeup lol atleast bratz have real heads and i gave 2 starts for durable because if u sit on it it wont got flat
5,Typical Nora Roberts...,...a must read!I don't know why people are complaining about this book. It simply is fantastic--a great start to a magnificent trilogy!
5,Awesome Trilogy,"This is my first review so it may not be as detailed as the others but I needed to let everyone know that this was my favorite trilogy of Nora Roberts. When Nora comes out with a trilogy I won't buy them until all three books are released because I want to read them all at once and this one was no exception. I couldn't put them down and had all three books read in two weeks! Working full time with three kids...this feat is a challenge and needless to say the laundry didn't get done. The magic, the dark side, the love, the war and the erotic sex made this her best yet! I downloaded these books to my Kindle but will now purchase them in hard copy so that I can share them with my friends and family."
5,Favorite Trilogy,"I was so incredibly pleased with this trilogy, that I think it is by far my favorite Nora Roberts trilogy. I don't like to go into details as to what the book is about because I think that the author can do that best on the back cover (and the summary posted here), but I can only tell you that it is a very creative trilogy. And maybe because of all of the vampire hype lately (yes, there is a vampire), I think it just made the series that much more enjoyable and current (even though it was written a while ago). Books like this remind me why I enjoy Nora Roberts' books so much."
2,Drawn Out Obviously With a Trilogy in Mind,"I was given all three of the books in this trilogy and started reading the first one eagerly looking forward to getting to know the characters. For me, there was too much needless dialogue throughout all three books. The story could have been told in one book if edited properly. It was simply boring reading through all of the arguments by the main characters. In the first two books, the main female characters were just plain nasty and rude most of the time. I only enjoyed the last book a little because the female lead character actually acted like a woman in love and not like Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2."
4,Intriguing and Exciting,"It was hard to understand the reader in the beginning, however, eventually I got used to his strong accent and became immersed in the story. Some of my friends could not take the accent and resorted to reading the book, and then became immersed, however, not everyone can handle this content with plenty of blood and immorality, vampires and such. However, it is a strong novel of the battle of good against evil and the good definitely outweighs the bad for me. I heard all 3 books and hated for them to end. I wish Nora would write a 4th book - I loved it!!!"
3,Morrigan's Cross,"A different writing style for Ms. Roberts and at times I wasn't sure if the words on paper were her own, or given over to a ghostwriter. The style is different from how she normally writes, but just the same, the story, in parts was intriguing.I found some of the dialogue redundant and the arguments mundane. The romance was sudden and unbelievable leaving the reader feeling they missed a chapter or two.I felt the book needed another edit--the language choice was poor and repetitive. Just the same, the change in style is a good attempt and I hope the next books in the trilogy bring the characters together. The book in some parts is engaging and others, flat."
3,Disappointing,"I've read most of Nora Roberts books and I have to say this entire series was somewhat disappointing. There are lots of ingredients for a great paranormal romance story here - witches, vampires, sorcerers, shapeshifters, dragons, time travel, but it's put together poorly and was hard to follow and envision.Book 1 of the trilogy is based on mostly 2 of the circle of 6, however Ms. Roberts is forced to spend a lot of time and energy on the other characters in order to set the stage for the coming books. That detracted from the story of these two and all of the voices were hard to follow. I found myself really anticipating the next book though, as it was clear the stage was being set.All in all, there was a story and it was told, but with all of the elements, it could have been done better. I look for more from Nora Roberts and hope to see it in the next book of hers I read, because it wasn't here as strongly as it has been in other books and trilogies."
3,"Sometimes cheesy, but good character developement","I am not a Romance fan and have only heard of Nora Roberts. I am a fantasy fan so I picked this book up while on vacation and needed something to read. At first the book started out cheesy and predictable, with all the typical fantasy cliches. I kept reading though and found myself sucked in. The character development was pretty good and now I want to know what happens to them, so I will be ordering the next book in the series."
2,"Morrigan""s Cross","I loved this book.I think the Circle Trilogy will be one of the best trilogies she has ever written, and I have read everything she has published. I was hooked from the first paragraphy. Morrigan'Cross has romance, suspense, witchcraft and vampires. I just finished this book. I am biting at the bit for the second book to be released.ENJOY"
3,It was okay,There was way too much description and redundancy of the love the two main characters had for each other. If I had known that there was no closure whatsoever at the end of the book then I wouldn't have bought it. I know it is a trilogy and I've read books like this before but the ending was just like an end to a chapter -- no satisfaction at all when I finished the book. The first chapter of the next book is added to the end of the book without starting the page numbers over and it was just fluff. It reminded me of the last season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
1,One Star,"The storyline is just so unbelievable and makes no sense. None of the charactors are fleshed out enough for to remember who each one is. The names don't help either. Nora Roberts charges on with the story without explaining anything like the whos, the whys and the hows. I gave up on the story half way through the story and I doubt I'll bother with reading the other two in the trilogy."
1,Disjointed and Dumb,"I love Nora Roberts, but the book didn't engage me and I couldn't connect with the characters. I finished it but it was hard going."
5,hands down my favorite nora roberts trilogy,"Nora always successfully brings her amazing characters to life. This trilogy has it all. Humor, romance, and suspense! Reading this was (as always) an absolute pleasure."
3,"Decent enough read, but don't store the book on your shelf","While not a romance fan, I did find this book entertaining. I enjoyed the storyline and characters, but my wife and I found ourselves laughing at the repetitive and continuous ""plunging in and out"" as the narrator spoke through the car speakers. This could have been a pretty good fantasy novel if not for these attempts at integrating sex scenes into the story. I know Nora Roberts is well known in the Romance genre, so I would assume her romance novels are written better than this."
3,Stuck In The Middle,"I've read it and I'm not sure if I liked it or not... that's not a good sign. I liked the plot, it's just there are so many characters and so much going on at once, that I think the characterization is lacking a bit. I got a good feel for Hoyt and Glenna, the main characters, but I think Ms. Roberts spent too much time on the other characters in this book that should have been focused on in the second and third in the trilogy.Too many POV's... we were in each character's point of view at one point in time and while that's a useful tool in letting us know about each character, I truly think this book would have been way better if Ms. Roberts had simply focused on Hoyt and Glenna, but that's just one reader's take."
4,I liked it,"didn't think I would after reading other reviews, but I liked it. More action then her usual, which may have left less room for character development. Jeez, what'd you all want, 7 book series of 600+ pages? Buy Harry Potter. I thought the sex was more sensual, romantic and less graphic than previous novels -- leaving more to the imagination -- though I've been noticing that welcome trend in many of Ms. Roberts most recent novels. Wasn't Montana Sky, but I recommend it and am looking forward to the next 2 in the series."
5,First of Vampire Trilogy,"After reading the prologue I could not get into it and put it aside after I got into another book. Then I picked it up again about 10 days later and had to re-read the prologue. This time I must have been in a different frame of mind as once I began I did not want to put it down. I devoured the first book, did the same for the second one and half way through the third I slowed down on purpose because I really did not want it to end. This was my introduction to Nora Roberts - recommended by a friend. I enjoyed it so much that I am probably going to be disapointed in the next book I pick up by her. If you enjoy interesting characters and fantasy, this is a delicious read with romance to garnish it."
2,First Nora Roberts disappointment ever!,This was the first book of Nora Roberts that I was really disappointed in. It was extremely slow and very hard to get through. The next two books in the Circle Trilogy were much better
5,Morrigan's Cross,The service of your shipment was very good.I have already read the book.Thank you for the great service you gave me.
2,What a disappointment!,"I'm a devoted Nora Roberts fan and have bought and read nearly every thing she writes. If it has her name on it, I only stop to check to make sure I don't already have it before I buy it.I'm rarely disappointed. Her characters, particularly in the trilogies, are well developed and make you want to root for them. Her descriptions are evocative and poetic.But Morrigan's Cross just didn't delight me as most of her books do. The characters were not engaging, the plot was predictable, the prose was so-so.I enjoy her forays into fastasy and sorcery, but maybe it was the vampyre which turned me off.I've had to force myself to continue to read (eventhough I stopped in the middle to re-read Chesapeake Blue!) and I'm still not done. I usually stay up all night to finish a NR book, but it's been nearly a week and I still haven't finished this one.I'm not sure if I'll buy the rest of this trilogy. We'll have to see."
2,Pick one of the other 100+ of hers,"I agree with the other reviewers who are criticizing this novel for being shallow and poorly worded in places. The characters seem like they're taken out of a playbook: one isolated sorceror, one sexy earth mama redhead, one overgrown kid off the streets, etc. The plot and setting are nothing special. Furthermore, Nora Roberts seems to have picked up Stephanie Laurens's bad habit of writing sentences that are missing a subject. And does it often; and it's ineffective.Nora Roberts can write better than this. The most recent trilogy--Red Lily, Black Rose, and Blue Dahlia--was far more vividly imagined. I wonder if she churned out this new trilogy in a month or two, skating through an unwanted homework assignment from her publisher to put out a vampire series now that they're so popular."
5,Wonderful,I didn't know if I would like it because of the vampire thing but once I started it I didn't want to put it down. I couldn't wait until I read the other 2 to find out what happens. Excellent book.
1,Morrigan's Cross,Just not my cup of tea. Well written but as I said not my cup of tea..I will not purchase the others in the series.
1,Big disappointment,"Morrigan's Cross was the worst book I've read by Nora Roberts, and having really enjoyed both the 'Born In' trilogy and the 'Gallaghers' trilogy, I expected more. Much more. The plot was rushed and totally unoriginal (think Buffy meets Diana Gabaldon); the dialogue was conventional and cliched; the female protagonist was barely likeable; and the love scenes were forced, incredibly brief, and not at all imaginative. I'm convinced that an aspiring and dreadfully untalented apprentice of Ms. Roberts wrote this book and published it in her name."
1,"Morrigan's Cross (Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","I have read pretty much everything Nora Roberts has written, some of it several times over, and I have not been disappointed, until now. I was not even able to get through the book. It is so unlike her previous Trilogies that I'm questioning whether she is the sole author or if she co-wrote it with someone. I was told that it is much more like her J.D. Robb series than her normal Nora Roberts writing. I was so looking forward to a new Trilogy and now, I am very disappointed. Sorry Nora, but this one, in my opinion, is a looser."
3,Review of Audio CD,"For those of us who listen to the Audio version, all three books in this Trilogy are read by the same narrator, which makes for good continuity. That said, I find fault with deep-voiced men who try to 'lighten up' to do the women's voices; it's very annoying. It makes the women seem shallow and childish. But Dick Hill did a great job with the general narrating and the men's voices, and overall I found the story to be engaging. An earlier reviewer stated that the major battle isn't until the third installment, but isn't that what we expect with a trilogy?I do recommend this series to fans of Nora Roberts and those who enjoy the paranormal."
2,Vampires and time travel - not a good combo for NR,"Nora Roberts is a great writer, but this book was terrible. I lost interest after the first few chapters. The story line seemed tired - the chosen few fighting a legion of vampires - and there was little character development. I won't be buying the next two installments."
2,Tried to Like It,"I'm a Nora Roberts fan and have read all of her books. I was just not able to get into this book. It's a little too dark and the characters are just not gripping. I had to struggle through, when I normally read her books in a day or two. I doubt I will purchase the second installment. I just don't care enough to do so."
1,Huge disappoinment,"I am a big Nora Roberts fan, and although I usually read her books in between heavier reads, I always enjoy them. This book was a really big disappointment. As a previous reviewer stated, most of the dialougue was nothing more than arguments between the very boring characters. Nothing in this book was believable or intriguing. I've read all of her books, and this was the first one I almost didn't finish. This read like one of those cheap, romance novels. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
3,Not one of her best.......by a long shot!,"Let me start by saying I love to read her books. Some of them I have read over and over again, however, this one here, not up to her normal standard. The characters seem plastic, cookie cutter, nothing interesting or worth reading. It is a shame. I pray this book is not the new standard from Ms. Roberts."
4,Wonderful Trilogy,"I wasn't sure when I bought this book that I would enjoy it, but it was Nora Roberts and typically I love her work. I had a bit of a hard time getting into the book at first but once I got into it I loved it. Book One ended and I didn't have book two on hand. I ordered book two and three right away. If you like vampires and witches this is a series you want to read."
3,Bland Vacation Book,I told my friend at work I was going on vacation & needed a new book to read. She handed me this one & said it was one of the best books she had ever read. She & I must have very different taste in books because it was a chore for me.I liked parts of it but most of it I really couldn't care less what was happening to whom. The beginning & ending really stink and again I had to force myself to read the middle.
5,Not just another Nora,"During my dry times in reading material, I have resorted to Nora Roberts alot. Most of her books become rote in the romance department.This series, however, is captivating in that it's different. It keeps you riveted to the characters and the eventual outcome. It's a real page turner. Nora Roberts writing in ""The Circle Trilogy"" is excellent. If you're up to a little diversity in your literary characters, I recommend this series.I also really liked the ""Three Sisters Trilogy"" which has some of the same magical element in it.I think Nora knows alittle bit too much of the magic side of life to be a mere bystander in the art."
3,Decent paranormal fantasy,"This is a paranormal fantasy - not a standard romance story. Morrigan's Cross is the first of a trilogy and has to set up the background for the whole series. This book started a little slow and I struggled to get into it, but once the main characters are introduced, it starts to move along. Hoyt and Glenna are the hero and heroine and while they are likable enough, they don't really sizzle. Each of the 6 main characters will be featured in one of the books. This is a decent read and I will continue with the next two in the trilogy: Dance with the Gods and Valley of Silence."
1,Not her best...,"I did not like this book. I couldn't even finish it and it was so disappointing because I always love Nora Roberts books. I hope after this trilogy she doesn't write anymore books like this, needless to say I won't be buying the other two books in the series."
1,Does not enhance the author's reputation,"There are good books about time travel, but this is not one of them. Try Jack Finney's TIME AND AGAIN, for example. And there are good books about vampires, but this is not one of them. Anne Rice more or less owns the franchise on the descendants of Dracula. So what is left? Not much, unfortunately. I was prepared to be entertained, but it didn't happen.MORRIGAN'S CROSS is slow and dull and predictable and just does not have the feel of Ms. Roberts' other books. It would be nice to say that this is a worthy effort on her part to do something different, but that wouldn't be accurate.My introduction to this writer was with NORTHERN LIGHTS, and after since reading a couple of dozen other books by Nora Roberts, the first one is still the best. The one here is the least. Still, I keep hoping."
2,Bloody Disappointment,"Like many, I can hardly wait for a new Nora Roberts and have just about every book she has written. The rest of this trilogy won't be added to the pile. The lush sensuality, the complex characters, the interesting men and the snappy dialog are in short supply here. But there is lots and lots of blood and gore pouring out of nearly every page. The plot has a bunch of people training to fight vampyres--cutesy spelling is hers--and barely repelling them. They announce they must train better and get stronger, and more vampyres come and are repelled. They train some more, and more vampyres do battle, with ever more blood gushing. Then the book just stops. The dark side of the author usually enhances her books, but this time it disgusts and bores. I am in mourning--not for the mob of the slain, but for the fun and excitement we have come to expect."
3,Slow to Start - Abrupt Ending,"Since I am a Nora Robert's fan--I was excited to see a new book on the stands and not a recovered book from her past (that I buy and end up figuring out 2 chapters in that I've already read it.) I just could NOT get going with this book!It wasn't her normal literary faire--although it had its gratuitous sex scenes throughout the book. I applaud her for trying something different (vampyres) and I loved the settings (New York and Ireland).I believe I was halfway through the book before it ""hooked"" me. It wasn't until Blair (the demon slayer) came into the story that I read with a bit more excitement.The story ended abruptly, but that is her way to get you to buy the next book in the series (out in October) so you can find out who won the big war between humans and vampyres."
5,Morrigan's Cross,"This was the beginning of one of the best trilogies I've ever read. If you like to get away from the everyday dulldrums and reality, ths is a good place to start. It only gets better with The Dance of the Gods and Valley of Silence."
3,Exciting new trilogy,Nora Roberts has done it again! What a great twist this trilogy has. I enjoy all of Nora's books good or bad. I can't wait for the next trilogy
3,Not a fan of vampire novels but am of Nora Roberts,I am a Nora Roberts fan and have read everything she has written. However I am not a fan of this type of fantasy. If this book had been written by another writer I wouldn't have bothered to read it. As I stated just not a fan of vampire books. However now that I have read the first book I am interested enough in the characters to see what happens to them so will finish the trilogy. I thought the pacing of the book was a little slow and the fight scenes a little weird. Overall this is not her best effort and I hope the last of this book type.
1,"disgusting, bloodthirsty--rates ""0"" stars","I have been a Robert's fan for 2 decades--own just about everything she has ever written--and this trilogy is the most disgusting, bloodthirsty, violent, grotesque piece of trash I have ever read. She just can't have written these. If the rating allowed ""O"" stars that would be my rating. Unfortunately, since so many millions of us buy on faith, the trilogy will most undeservedly end up a best-seller unit. I read #1 and threw it out, something I have never ever done with a Robert's book. Got 1/3 of the way threw #2 and into the garbage along with the untouched #3."
1,Broken 4 time in 200 miles,I did not choose this chain but it came on a new Motobecan bike from bikes direct. I love this full supension mountaion bike but i hate this chain which I have broken 4 time in the fist 200 miles of riding the bike. If you buy this chain buy extra master links since you will need them
3,Disappointing at best in reflecting and light catching properties.,"This crystal caught and reflected very little light. I have repositioned it and changed physical locations and have concluded that the cut of this crystal does not allow it to ""sparkle"" as listed...""The sparkle in this crystal a makes it a gorgeous and easy gift or ornament!"". I gave it a three star because it is not honestly listed, out of all fairness it is cut well, has a highly polished surface, and probably would make a decent decorative item to hang, but do not expect the sparkle or light catching and dispersing properties of other designs, it is simply the wrong shape. If you are looking for a true sun catcher as I was here then try : 76mm Teardrop Suncatcher Crystal Prisms #873-76. If you want a high quality Icicle Prism then with this item here you will be well pleased, just do not expect the light patterns and sun catching properties."
3,icicle prism,not much of a prism effect. difficult to adjust direction of crystal to produce prism effect. would not purchase another one.
3,Heavy duty,"This face plate is made of heavy duty stock and is thicker than the usual.Consequently, it stands out further from the wall, and the receptacle is sort of recessed inside the face plate."
4,Zombie Shocker gets Riffed for Fun,"This old black and white movie was cheaply made but became a Cult Hit shock horror film that started the Flesh-Eating Zombie movie craze. The old MST3K crew of Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett take it on with quite a few funny riffs. Some don't quite hit the spot, and the guys miss some choice moments to riff, but that's always the case with Rifftrax. One of the better ones was, ""A Zombie's Worst enemy, a Clothesline."" The clueless young couple who try to escape the zombies and the ultra-Angry family man get lots of attention. Rifftrax does not include old MST3K things like skits, sets, or the Bots. You never See the guys in any form. You simply HEAR them from the beginning to the end of the movie. Not even an Intro!I also recommend Rifftrax ""House on Haunted Hill."" It's terrific."
4,Even zombies can be funny.,"If you like MST3K, you will laugh at this video. Mike and the guys are in top form as they demonstrate the lighter side of flesh-eating mutants (and their victims !)."
3,Perfect for scholars of the time,"The Paston family, whose large collection of personal correspondence is the basis for this book, helps us see firsthand the lifestyle and attitudes of the Middle Ages. Although intriguing, I wasn't ready to limit my medieval reading to one family. The sheer volume of information obtained from personal correspondence and legal records makes this a heavy read if you are not a scholar. I read all the other Gies books with great enjoyment."
2,Could've been better,"This book has a unique and interesting premise--a look into the daily lives of 15th century English men and women through their letters. However, the book is too fact-filled about very ordinary people and you may end up finding yourself skipping to the end."
2,Arrived in bad condition,"Fine paper, but every packet was slightly damaged on one end, putting a slight crease in the paper. I don't think it happened in transit."
3,Paper seemed to be opened.,"We've always bought this paper from Staples. The paper is great. From this seller on Amazon (SHOPLET), 3 of the reams were torn open, not damaged though. 3 of the reams were not even packaged(!) it is all loose in the box!!?? (not damaged though) I geuss we got lucky, but won't buy from this seller again; SHOPLET."
3,Copy Paper,"The copy paper was user friendly , it did not curl of cause any paper jams while copying materials."
4,Good value,I can't give this five stars cuz you can certainly buy better paper. It is hard to beat the value though.
1,Never order a box of paper for delivery,"This was my first buying experience with Amazon; and likely my last. I was disappointed when the box delivered was wet and damaged. I was happy at the ease to report the damage, request a replacement, and return the damaged goods. The second box arrived in better shape, as it was heavily surrounded in clear box tape. However, the box still looked like it was thrown around. My suspicions were correct, as when I open the second box, 8 of the 10 reams of paper were broken open; and the edges of several sheets were curled. It was not worth my time and effort to send it back again. I learned a lesson and will never order paper or stationary supplies for home delivery again. I took a few pictures if you want to see them."
1,"very strong plastic smell, and not able to return","this one have very strong plastic smell, I dont think it is completely okay to breath-in through this product. and when I want to return it. They do not accept it. So it is a waste of 100 dollars for me!"
2,Don't waste your money.,The author uses very old references and listing for the few spells actually in the book. Despite the title this is not a book of spells at all. I have seen much better books elsewhere that are more worth my time and money. Out of the numerous books I have gotten on the subject this is one of the few I've returned. The spells in it are things that you can probably find elsewhere as well.
1,"use a dictionary, when reading","this book was full of words that are no longer used. Basically, I would NOT recommend this book. It was very dry and hard to follow, in other words, boring."
4,Truly a man of God and the people,"It was amazing to read about George Whitefield and how he taught the masses that God is personal. I like the quote from Mrs. Edwards to the Rev. James Pierrepont ""...very many persons in Northampton date the beginning of new thoughts, new desires, new purposes and a new life from the day they heard him preach..."""
3,I should have gotten pointed tips,"The syringe shown in the picture is what I should have gotten. Instead, I got the ones without tips so at least some of the content stays inside the syringe and it's harder to use - I use it to give vitamins to my cats. I don't know how I got the syringes without the tips. I recall seeing a picture like the one here. I can hardly wait until I'm done using them so I can go back to my old supplier. The ones I got probably have a use. It's just not the use I needed it for."
2,Sandal was too thin to fit on my foot,The area where the big toe has to fit its fabric height is to low that the big toe does not entry on the saldal
2,cheap and uncomfortable,These are not worth buying. They are flimsy and not at all like Birkenstocks which they seem to want to be.
3,White mtn Carly's,Shoes fit nice. Love them! Had to reattach buckles on both sandals so that was'nt good. But I didnt have time to return them and get replacement before our trip.
2,Wite Mountain Sandals,When I saw these sandals on line I thought they looked similar to the pricierBirkenstocks.They were however not as comfortable and the uppers cut into my feet. In this case it was not 'you get what you paid' because a few days later I happened to be in Walmart and got a pair of similar sandals by Faded Glory and they are 'glorious'they were also on sale for the bargain price of $5 !!. I had to go back and buy all the colors they had.
4,C How To Program,"I am currently using this book for my CS150 class at WSU. A very informative book to say the least but for those beginners out there I would recommend a book more oriented to beginner programmers. I will say that the only way I'm making it through this class is with the help of this book. Many examples, with just enough explanation and you should pick up the concepts in no time."
5,"great book, but hard exercises","I have found this book quite excellent in that it uses clear and understandable language to preach a difficult programming language. I definitely never studied computer in my college(I got two BAs which now I usually find outdated in present 'technologized' world). The book is good, but it does not provide enough exercises with explainations! Many of the exercises are really time-consuming and frustrating, maybe not for classroom learners, but for a dedicated self-learner, it represents quite a bumpy journey. Anyhow, I think I will carry on."
2,Not good for inexperienced programmers,"This was a required book for my university course. I found it to be quite good (I have been programming in various languages since age 6 - now 19), however most of my classmates who were inexperienced programmers found it horrendous. The teaching staff are currently looking for a new text as they find it awful to teach from. I found at least one code sample that doesnt actually comnpile."
2,Not for beginners.,"I am presently using this book in a college C class. I find it to be very open ended. A topic is introduced, and then you are left hanging. I also feel that it is hard to read and understand if you do not already have a foundation in programming"
1,Definitely NOT for beginners!!!,"I am a CS student and have some experience in C. I find this book extremely condensed and ""hard-to-read"". The authors claimed that it is suitable for beginners. NOT TRUE!!!. It's good for those who have years of experience programming in C, but not recommended for CS/CIS students."
4,Good Book But Hard To Start With,"This is the first programming book I have ever owned. I read it several times each time found something new. However, the book is too enormous for a beginner, one can easily get lost at first shot. Also, the first 5 chapters seems more like a C tour than a C++ one"
5,The best introductory C++ book available.,"C++: How to Program by Deitel and Deitel is clearly the most understandable and complete elementary C++ textbook on the market. Unlike most other authors of programming texts, Deitel & son (and/or their editor) are capable of writing clear, informative standard English. They do not assume any prior programming knowledge. (Be aware that they more or less assume the reader is using a UNIX-based compiler without saying so, but this should not stop you from getting the book if you use a different OS.) One weakness that perhaps will be corrected in a future edition is they do not effectively introduce object-oriented features of C++ at the very beginning (although they do begin explaining the philosophy behind OOP from the start). Excellent, educational exercises are provided in each chapter. For those just learning C++, do not buy any other text before this one."
3,Why so long ?,"After reading the book,which I found quite interesting,I was left wondering how ""Mr. Homeless"" stayed homeless for so long. He seemed determined to stay in NYC for some reason. I myself have been homeless for short periods. I follow the old adage that for the most part says ""IF you are moose hunting go where the moose are"". If you are unemployed and homeless go where the jobs are. In other words maybe its time to get the hell out of Dodge! He had it bad no doubt, I just cannot understand WHY he stayed."
4,Track title list is wrong,"This is one of those bands that I got into by listening to their later work, and discovered this little gem not too long ago. Much better than most heavy metal released in 1985.My only complaint comes from the way the song titles are listed on the back of the album. To clarify, this is the re-release with bonus-tracks, the real track listing is as follows:1 - Council For The Cauldron2 - Psychopath3 - Save Me4 - Red Rum5 - Love You To Pieces6 - American Metal7 - Flesheater8 - Warfare9 - Godiva10 - Rod Of Iron11 - Wild One (Demo)12 - Whiplasher (Live Demo)13 - Warfare (Live Demo - Alternative Version)14 - Dirty Pictures (Demo)"
3,Pretty good.,"I admit that I've never listened to Love You to Pieces as much as other albums from Lizzy Borden. I still think that it's pretty good though. Love You to Pieces is hard rock with aggression. There are lots of guitars and energy throughout. I've always admired Lizzy Borden's vocals--his singing is truly unique, and I've never heard anyone else that sounds like him. My favorite tune out of the bunch is ""American Metal."" That's one of Lizzy Borden's best songs--it really rocks hard. The rest of the songs are good too, and the lyrics are interesting. Guitarists Gene Allen and Tony Matuzak do well with the guitar duties. Love You to Pieces is worth a listen."
2,The title is too big for the book.,"It includes feminist twists in the stories, but still has ""gender assigned"" stories...Do not buy this book if you have, like me, studied feminism in many ways. It will be sure to dissapoint you."
5,Inacceptably underrated,"Appart of the typical bad sounding myths, this is the best in every aspect, included the Leonore III magnificently conducted and played. The alternative is Harnoncourt's. Klemperer's Vickers, sounds to me too ""lacrimoso""."
5,Yumski!,I ate at this delightful place while visiting Seattle and ordered this book days after my return.Can't wait to dig into this cookbook. Layout looks very easy to follow.I am just waiting for my foot to healso I can return to the kitchen!
4,A must read for anyone with hypoglycemia,"This book provides a comprehensive, well-researched explanation of what hypoglycemia is and how it can so adversely affect us. An eye-opener.The author offers a practical, positive approach to managing hypoglycemia including the simple but important practice of eating regularly-scheduled meals and of keeping blood sugar levels up throughout the day with small snacks. He includes many helpful recipes and resources for ingredients.The emphasis on an active lifestyle reinvigorated my resolve to continue on that path. Nutritional food, fresh air, sunshine, time spent in the country...the healing power is amazing."
5,One of the 20th century's great artistic works,i am now a great fan of faulkners after having read at least 12 of his 17 novels and having re-read most of them but i assure you his greatest achievement is without doubt this read it for insight into faulkners complete view of the old south and relations between blacks and whites there in unforgettable prose and tight plotting with near perfect craftsmanship in narration one of my all time favourite books
2,A slog,"We chose this for our book group many of us having read Faulkner in school and loving him. But unanimously we found it a tough read, at times unintelligible. I got halfway through the book before abandoning. The story was interesting and I was curious to find out how it played but not enough to finish the book. Maybe I'm not smart enough; I often think if I can't 'get' a book it's my fault but in this case I was not alone."
2,Lost...indecipherable...,"Although I acknowledge the fact that Faulkner is a brilliant author, and Absalom, Absalom! is a cornerstone book of American Literature, I simply cannot digest it because it is so complex and cryptic in its language. I'm actually an English major in college, so if I can hardly get through this book then I wonder what the less-hardcore literary types make of it. Perhaps this purported gem can be more readily appreciated at the Graduate School level...or by someone with exceptional literary prowess...I can hardly get past the dizzying details to the larger picture..."
2,No. Just no.,"I did NOT like this book. I had to read it for an Honors English class during my freshman year of uni, and it was one of the worst ones I had to read. Yes, I understood it (for those who think that anybody who dislikes a book that they like just doesn't understand the material)--heck, I got an A on my essay and talked my way through the mandatory one-on-one tutorial. But that period was very, very trying.The style is very hard to get into. AA is filled with the run-on sentences that ate New Jersey. Yes, I realize that that was Faulkner's style for this book, but it wasn't a particuarly wise choice to make.The only reason that I am giving it two stars is because the storyline isn't half-bad. If only Faulkner had sped things up a little bit, and stopped with all the superfluous and extraneous junk, I might have actually liked this book."
5,Faulkner's finest,"I will state this simply: Absalom! Absalom! belongs among a very small collection of literary masterpieces such as, oh, the Bible, the collected works of The Bard, Plato's Republic, Thoreau's Walden, Melville's Moby Dick, Joyce's Ulysses, Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls, and Faulkner's own The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying, and Light in August."
5,The Great American Novel,"Faulkner's most compelling trait is he doesn't tell a story--he involves the reader in it so the reader, in effect, pieces it together in his mind as he reads it. It's hard work, but hard work is always more rewarding than the slop that passes for much of fiction these days (as well as back then). Faulkner makes you work, and this brilliant story of a doomed Southern family is a brilliant allegory for the entire South. It's about the human condition, and no one explains and explores it better than Faulkner. Read it and you'll understand...."
1,Missing pages,I bought this book for a class. I was eager to read it because I had heard so many great things about it. When I got to page 116 it skipped right to page 149 leaving out parts of chapter four and five. I was disappointed that I had to go and buy another copy. Hopefully this one will have all of its pages.
2,For Masochists Only,"Life is too short for this sort of thing. I even gave up on this book listening to an unabridged version on tape. I can't even imagine what reading it would be like with its ultra-dense, paragraph-averse style. Who would have thought that authors were this self-indulgent even back in the 30's!Skip the entire ridiculously undecipherable book and read the chronology and geneaology in the back! Join the ranks of proud low-brows who have other books to read and enjoy!"
2,Disappointing,"This purchase has taught me to look at ALL of the reviews, not just the overall star rating. It's not at all what I expexcted. There are no photos or illustrations on how the baskets could be arranged. Instead of stating exactly what to put in each basket, I'd prefer to have more suggestions. As for including recipes for the homemade items,Food Network, Epicurious, etc. can fill that need."
3,Not as expected,"I am not saying this is a ""bad"" book. It has good ideas for making a gift basket. However, I was disapointed that there were no pictures. The book is pretty general. I suppose I picked the wrong book for what I was looking for. I am going to go back and look at the other books like this one and purchase another one or two.... It is a good book if you are just really looking for some ideas. I wanted something that was more geared toward making gift baskets as a business, this is more on a personal level."
2,Disappointed - no pictures,"I thought that this book would give me at least a few pictoral examples on how to make gift baskets. I was disappointed. I'm not naturally creative, so my feeble attempts at using the book did not come off looking as good as I had hoped. On the other hand, one of my daughters-in-law loved it and wants me to order 2 for her."
4,Better than I thought!,"When I heard that my favorite band KISS was doing a movie I started thinking about KISS Meets The Phantom Of The Park (1978) and I said to myself, oh, no...But I heard that the band weren't the actors, I was relieved! So I read about it in movie magazines and I thought the story was kinda cool. I saw it and it is a good movie, not a classic but a very good entertainment. The actors are great we can see the chemistery between them and it makes it even better. Don't hesitate rent it or buy it but you have to see it!"
3,sorry,"I can't like this, because Edward Furlong is in it, and I friggin hate him. I want to kill him! Overall, this movie is actually pretty funny. Take out Furlong, and you got a solid movie."
2,"It's No ""Dazed and Confused""","DETROIT ROCK CITY (1999) * * Four kids in 1978 (?) and their efforts to get to a KISS concert in Detroit. Not much more plot than that, and it pales in comparison to Dazed and Confused in its depiction of that time period and to American Pie in its teen sex hijinks. A few good chuckles and a good rock soundtrack."
3,Good dumb guilty pleasure fun.,"Definatly not a quality flick, the directing is all over the place, preoccupied with sex and vomit, not a good performance in the entire film. All of these things HELP Detroit Rock City. It's good, dumb fun to sit back to and have a few laughs with a couple good tunes thrown in for good measure."
2,Anti Catholic,"Had funny moments but went unnecessarily overboard with the anti Catholic stuff. Lousy, cheap shots. Could have been better if they just stuck to being funny. They didn't."
3,Funny rock and roll comedy.,"This is a well done comedy about the travails of 4 teenagers as they try to get to a Kiss concert in Detroit. There's good chemistry between the actors and the movie catches the spirit of the '70s well. It's not necessary to be a Kiss fan to enjoy the movie. In fact the soundtrack contains relatively little Kiss music, which is probably good, since it sounds embarrassingly lame next to the '70s rock that is used (AC/DC, Thin Lizzy, Black Sabbath etc). The movie falters a bit at the end as each of the guys gets involved in their own little scenario to try to get tickets, but overall it's a nice, funny film. Not in the league with 'Dazed and Confused' or 'Rock and Roll High School' but still a good movie. DVD quality is good."
3,Packed full of laughs & music!,This movie was surprisingly entertaining. Even if you aren't a KISS fan you will enjoy it. If you are a KISS fan this is a must have.
5,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE, AMAZON RULES","Perhaps one of the best movies I've ever seen, Eddie furlong from terminator, KISS and a crazy roller coaster ride full of rock and roll. I was determined to find this movie, pretty much obsessed, couldn't find it in stores, used Amazon, had a gift card with 4 bucks on it and bought it with the remaining price of $0.50!!! along with some screen protectors for my cell phone. Pretty much the best buy for a movie ever, period. I recommend it to anyone who loves KISS and or rock and roll \m/!!!"
4,great flick,As long time member of the Kiss army my self and my two teenage boys got a kick out of this film. It was funny the music was great!!
2,"Marginally better than ""Kiss Meets The Phantom""......","I lived this premise. So believe me when I tell you that compaired to ""Dazed And Confused"", DRC is like drinking bong water."
4,This is not just a teen gross-out movie.........,"Sure it is not high art, but to focus on comparisons with other recent teen flicks is to miss the point. Maybe you have to understand the mythology surrounding Cobo Hall and the passions of Kiss fans. Characters are made funnier by the endless in-jokes and music references, so if you are a member or once were a memeber of the Kiss Army then welcome to a great nostalgia trip. If you were into Disco then I hope you like being laughed at, while if you were expecting jokes about vomit then there is only 1 really to speak of. So sit back and get ready to........ ROCK AND ROLL ALL NITE - AND PARTY EVERY DAY!!!!"
5,"This Movie ""Rocks""!","I got this Movie for the DVD and I probably watched it about a hundred times, it's so halarious, it's got verbal and text menu's. If you have a guitar there's even a special feature were they teach you how to play rock and roll all night! and many other features as well like Music Videos, Theatrical Trailer and Three Feature Length Commentaries. GO BUY THIS MOVIE! The Soundtrack to this film is AWESOME too it gots The Boys Are Back in Town, Shout It Out Loud, Detroit Rock City, Cat Scratch Fever, And a really twisted version of Highway to Hell by Marilyn Manson. Almost all of the songs on the CD are remixes from different artists but they ROCK. If you buy only one soundtrack to a movie this year make it this one you won't regret it I gurantee it!"
1,did not work,"I am sending this back. The movie did not work, would not play in my standard DVD player nor would it play on my laptop. Appears to be a bootlegged copy."
3,fun movie,"I saw DRC in the theatre in the summer of 99. the theatre was pretty empty. actually, the movie usher said it was the emptiest he has seen it on a friday night all summer. But regardless, the movie was pretty funny. They should've named it Toronto Rock city as the Now torn down Exhibition stadium substituted for Cobo Hall. The radio station , church ( actually St James Catheral), diner and strip bar entrance occupied all 4 corners of Church and King streets in Toronto. They actually meet up right in the middle of the intersection in the Movie. I came upon it on my way to school in the fall of 98 when they were in town filming. The Finally kiss concert was held at Copps Coliseum in Hamilton ,Ontario. about 40 minutes west of Toronto. 3000 fans showed up to help out with the concert footage , it was convenient for the Band as they were in Toronto the night before playing the Skydome for the psycho Circus tour. Just some inside info on this funny flickpeace"
1,KISS + a bad movie =????,"A bad movie. As a KISS fan, I just can't get into it. I actually enjoyed phantom of the park more, which was cheesy but never claimed to be anything more."
2,Not particularly that good.,"I didn't like Detroit Rock City that much. I managed to view the entire film, but I seriously doubt that I'll ever watch it a second time. It reminded me of American Pie a little. I've always had a lot of respect for Kiss, mostly because they were the first band I got into when I was very small in the late seventies. Detroit Rock City wasn't original and the script wasn't great. The movie had some moments here and there, but on the whole it was mostly bland and not very interesting. A disappointing movie."
1,One rotten flick,"This movie is just plain bad. You start out really wanting to sympathize with the four boys. I mean who can't identify with trying to score tickets to your favorite band's sold out show.The problem is they all turn out to be such jerks you end up hoping they get the (...) beat out of them.Not to mention, the portrayal of the Catholic mom and priest is one of the most vicious, mean-spirited, caricatures on film I have ever seen. If the film makers had portrayed blacks, Jews or any other ethnic/religious group in this manner they'd have been drummed out of the movie business.My recommendation is to watch ""That 70's Show."""
2,"Bad Music, KISS Smells","""God gave rock 'n roll to you."" Sure. I don't like to see old guys still trying to be cool. Even the one with the long tongue. That's foul. Those four high school dudes had some funny moments, especially when one tried to rob a kid. But in the long run, they should've sold their KISS tickets. Nobody likes them anymore. Good granny for burning the tickets. Since ""Detroit Rock City"" takes place in duh, Detroit, there should have been better music like Vanilla Ice. Well, any music would've surpassed KISS. Noise to the ears, ugly to the eyes."
2,VERY WEAK,"This movie has a good general idea surrounding him, but the execution was poor. Of course it is a mere vehicle for KISS to make more money ( Gene Simmons is one of the executive producers ). Even ex-porn star and porn movie producer Ron Jeremy has a small role in the form of a stripper-show producer. The young cast saves the date, giving inspired performances. The rest is to be forgotten. It's not a critic to rock, it's not a teenager analysis, it's not an all-out comedy, somewhere the movie lost its way and got more like a MTV product."
5,A GREAT MOVIE...,"I was not expecting this movie to impress me at all and almost didn't go. Being a KISS fan though, I had to see it. 20 minutes into the movie, I knew I was buying it. Sure the acting wasn't the best, but the characters were endearing and the film itself and directing was great. You can see the thought and detail that went into this project and I think Adam Rifkin did a great job in capturing the mood of that era and age. His directing is definitely not ""all over the place"", but he draws you into the scene and then all of a sudden it changes and you are taken by surprise. The music selections which play through the movie also help in this effect. Let's face it - this is a movie about three guys going to a concert - let's appreciate it for what it is...an entertaining, nostalgic and funny film."
4,A REAL DVD!,"Now this is why i bought my DVD years ago before it caught on. The movie is a teen comedy that is loaded with the 70's faithfully recreated as someone born in 71 and raised in 70's & 80's in school i can relate to the teens in this movie about heavy metal heads wanting to go see KISS perform. The movie won't win any awards but is good for what it is, but it's the DVD that stands out. To bad New Line was bought by Warner they have the best record for loading DVD's packed with tons of extra's, 3 commentary's by director, actors, and KISS and deleted scenes and instructions how to play KISS tunes makes this movie a must buy for DVD buyers. Place it with Mallrats DVD with good teen film and way cool extra's, now if only the other companies would release DVD's like this"
5,Uschi's 'Detroit' Review,"'Detroit Rock City' is a nice film.Yes, some of the gags and comical mishaps are rather unbelievable when you think of it, but you're not supposed to think about it, just watch it. I give the film itself 3 stars.It is fast and fun.I give 2 other stars for the very sweet performances of Sam Hungtingtons' ""JAM"" and Giuseppe Andrews' ""LEXX"". And for the record, I'm not a KISS fan or a Furlong fan, and I had no previous knowledge of any of the other cast members, so I'm coming from a neutral standpoint in my review. However, I have never heard the F-word so many times...but I guess boys will be boys..."
4,Quality,"I thought this was a fun, quality movie. Good actors, good writing. I'm not particularly a KISS fan (though I do like Rock and Roll) so that is not a requirement. 70's nostalgia for the slightly older generation, a retro lesson for the younger. Disco lovers beware. Be prepared for a comic book style, caricatures and irreverence but I think that is evident from the poster and the previews. Worth seeing and can somebody please book them for dialogue on the next star wars?"
4,Good movie - even if you're not a Kiss fan.,"Although this film contains a good amount of gross out humour (think Eddie Furlong vomiting into a jug onstage in front of 100 randy females) it is certainly worthwile, even for those who are not great fans of KISS. The performances from the four boys are excellent and good fun to watch, and the rockin' 70's soundtrack keeps the movie rolling. DRC is a good, fun movie which can be watched a couple of times over, and still have the power to make you laugh."
4,"Good, Solid, Fun","Like most Kiss products, I've had to either read, re-read, listen, re-listen, or, in this case, watch and re-watch, the movie. And, the more I watch, the harder I laugh. There is so much in the movie I missed the first time I saw it in a theatre. And, they've done a remarkable job of catching ""the 70's"" on film; from the sound-track, to the cars, to the scenery, to the hair-styles. . .very well done. My favorite scene: Hawk puking, and puking. . .and puking prior to his strip ""tease."" It is not a masterpiece, and it won't go down as a ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" quality-production. . .but good. . .Watch it again and again. . .and laugh, like I did, harder, and harder. It's nice to see Kiss make fun of themselves. . ."
4,expansion gate,When I received the gate it came with a split rail. A nail split the wood and the split adversly affected the integrity of the gate. I contacted the company and they eagerly sent me another gate with free return shipping for the defective gate. The gate works very well and is of the quality I expected from a gate of this type. The plastic clip that locks the expansion device in place is difficult to release and requires extra effort to manipulate. I do recommend this product; it is a good value for the money & the company stood behind their product.
3,Not too sturdy,"This gate works okay, but it really isn't all that sturdy and the way the arm comes down it would be easy to break it off accidentally. I don't really recommend this to anyone."
1,Not as stated!,"I purchased the 24x27-40""WIt expands to only 37 inches wide, not 40"" as stated.Very hard to set up as the controls you need to use are extremely stiff.I'm truly sorry I bought this."
2,"Does the job, but seemingly made of balsa wood","It is big, it is wide, it is cheap - in price and construction. It gets the job done, but one of the notches to latch the gate down has already completely broken off. This means it won't stay at that width, and considering the width of the doorway is pretty constant, means that it won't hold well to the doorway opening anymore. I plan to put a bolt or a screw through it to replace the broken piece of wood, but I am not very hopeful that the wood will hold up to that either."
3,Good and bad....,"The short stories that were written in this book were very detailed and had excellent style and really kept the reader entranced. The only problem was that each story seemed to be about the same weak female characters.. it was just a different setting for each story. I definitely like how Alice Munro writes about women though, and I'm going to read some of her other works to compare them, and maybe see exactly where she is coming from."
2,Infuriating,"Although I did enjoy the first two stories in this collection, that enjoyment dramaticially decreased as I read through the rest of the book. Munro's almost constant use of WEAK female characters is infuriating, and I personally am offended by it. Munro also aims to be realisitc, but after a certain point, all of the stories seem to have the exact same conflict but with different character names. While I read the first story in the collection ""Walker Brother Cowboys,"" I had high expectaions; unfortunately, after the first 8 or 10 stories, I was very disappointed."
5,Munro's short stories are contemporary classics-,"Alice Munro's collection of short stories embodies over 25 of her finest works. Within the text, she deals with issues of family, friends, betrayal, and the creation of art--sometimes all at once. Her writing is powerful, and she controls it with unimaginable skill. A must-read for anyone truly interested in the art of fiction."
5,Primacy of the Pope: An Orthodox Perspective,"As a recent convert from Roman Catholicism to Orthodoxy, I especially recommend this volume of essays, regarding the primacy of Peter, and, by extension, the primacy of the Pope, to any Roman Catholic interested in Orthodoxy. The essays are well researched and well balanced, and give the reader the Orthodox point of view regarding the claims of the Papacy, without resorting to polemics.I also recommend the book ""Rome, Constantinople, Moscow: Historical and Theological Studies"" written by Fr. Meyendorff as well as ""The Orthodox Church"" by Bishop Kallistos Ware for anyone interested in the history of the Church."
2,Can't sleep,"Although these are described as lightly caffeinated, they make me feel hyper-caffeinated. I don't have any scientific basis for this, but I can't sleep when I take these."
1,PIE aux input switcher,"Piece of crap, an it took six months to get returned for a refund. I wouldn't do business with these folks again."
4,an american master,"To My Sister; The Heron; No Bird; Elegy for Jane; She; Her Reticence; The Meadow Mouse; and of course, My Papa's Waltz--these are all some of the great poems that Theodore Roethke wrote. Roethke is one of our American masters. I found that when he was on his game (as he was in the poems above, among others) his poetry was phenomenal, but when he wasn't, his poetry could be awful. His earlier work is better than his later work, though he seems to have gotten most of his recognition for his later work. Still, for the poetry lover this is pretty much a required volume for your shelves."
4,A Lot of Fine Poetry,"A nice inexpensive edition of Roethke's poetry. There is a great deal of interesting and sometimes powerful poetry in this book. While taste's will differ, I find the earlier and later poems to be the most compelling. A good deal of Roethke's work in the middle of his life is characterized by experimentation with language. The later poems, in particular, combine the more direct approach of Roethke's earlier poems with greater command of language and imagery. Roethke's use of nature imagery in the later poems, often in the context of reflections on his personal life and problems, is outstanding."
5,To guide and inform a life,"I have always been transfixed by this man's poetry. Roethke possessed a way of speaking in his poetry that was both confessional and deeply spiritual. He was beyond doubt one of the greatest American poets of the 20th Century. Some of his poems, like Journey to the Interior, The Far Field, The Lost Son, and so many others create an almost religious experience in the reader.Roethke suffered from bipolar disorder throughout most of his life, and this experience (extreme emotional ups and downs) colored his vision of the world around him. But there is no trace of self-pity, and no great emphasis on depression or death. Instead, love, time, age, and the mystery of life are the themes of his poetry. He saw life as a religious experience, and was essentially a pantheist at heart.This is a book to give as a gift to some Seeker, if you are lucky enough to know someone who fits into that category. It's a book to guide, inform, and heal a life."
4,A shame it's no longer in print,"If you have any curiosity at all about the man who built those famous, fairytale castles in Germany, this is an excellent overview. It pairs a good, basic biography with loads of images and pulls the reader into Ludwig's world in a way a less well-illustrated biography might not. The images are, in fact, the strongest part of this book since the narrative, though good, isn't what you'd call a comprehensive study of Ludwig's life. If you want depth, you'll have to look elsewhere. But for a better understanding of the king and the time and place in which he lived, this is an excellent beginning."
2,Average,"This book didn't help me as much as other AP English Lit books, It's content is sporadic, and not as focused as Barron's or the Princeton Review."
3,its ok,it wasnt what i thought i was ordering. the product description picture shows a full case of paper. that picture needs changed.
3,Men's opinion,This book was an easy read but was very one-dimensional. Ended very abruptly. Left me wondering what would happen next.
1,A dud,I've read most of Parker's efforts. Although they are generally great this one really let me down. Not worth reading.
4,Of course it's autobiographical...,"I didn't know there was any question of it. I first picked this book up years ago at the library because the opening is set at Colby College, a school attended by several friends and acquaintances and just up I-95 from here. I enjoyed it enough to follow the librarian's advice and try the Spenser novels (there were only a few then). It is generally assumed here in New England, home of Parker, Spenser, and Boone, that the story is based on Parker's own experiences. I'm buying a copy now for my son's girl friend, a Colby alumna."
3,A little misleading,"This book is a good attempt at demonstrating parallels between the words of Christ and Lao Tzu - but is falls short. For one thing, other biblical writer's words are used as parallels, such as Paul, and I believe one of the psalmists, so the title is misleading. Some of the parallels are impressive, while others are tenuous, stretching it quite a bit. Some of the chapter introductions are pretty well-written, though. It's a light read, not the least bit scholarly, and probably won't give you any more parallels than you could have quickly found yourself from reading the Tao, assuming you are familiar with the New Testament."
3,Landlords-mentality is better,"Diffrent kind of music ,rap-metal ... Well some songs are really cooool and some are not that cool. So here are the cool ones:The truthCatch meWarfairRosegroveThere is also a more unknown group only availble only in sweden thats 1000 times better called Landlords-Mentality get a hold of that cd. Its really cheap in sweden and way heavy and special."
1,YUK!,"This is the worst quality live recording I've ever heard. The great packaging of this cd lured me in to buying it. When I put this in the player it was virtually unlistenable. I've heard some very bad live bootlegs that sounded better than this one. It's a shame great songs like ""Sweet Angeline"" and ""Darkness Darkness"" had to go to waste. Pass on this and get their BBC live album. My copy of this one's going back to the used cd bins."
1,Dreadful,"Wow - bought this for under five dollars and still feel had. After one listen, it was easy to guess as to why it was in a used CD rack for so cheap. The quality of this CD is equivalent to an old Western Auto cassette recorder held in the air from a few rows off the stage, and gets worse the longer the show continues. (Likely due to increasing loudness of the mix.) Indiscernible performances, distorted and warblely from old worn tapes. Rumor is that this was a cassette Ariel Bender found in his closet. If this story is true, it explains the hideous quality.Avoid at all costs. Get the CBSLiveMott. You'll be much happier."
3,Not the Prussian blue I thought,"Be carefull, I just found out that there are 2 bands called Prussian blue, and on the amazon item description there are no song titles, no ""hear before you buy"" I am writting the first review, and in the CD cover pics, both bands are mixed together. I ended up with a Prussian blue that is a asian soft rock type band. The Pursian blue I was looking for is a american folk band of 2 young sisters. This asian Pursian blue isn't bad but it's not was I was looking for."
1,good stuff,"if you enjoyed their first album, this one matches up to it pretty well. the graphics on the disc are cool too."
4,CHIXDIGGIT keeps their fans happy with this 2nd release!,"Dont have it yet? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? This cd is awesome, a great follow up to their first cd, ""Chixdiggit"". GO GET THIS ONE and you'll love it as well. Oh and if you haven't seen them live, you are missing out. I saw them in California and they were tons of fun! I recommend this one, and the first one as well. While listening to it, be sure to play it all the way to the end and wait...for a hidden SURPRISE. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
1,BAD DESCRIPTION,"I am giving this item one star because it was not obvious to me from reading the Amazon description that you had to have a laminating machine from this company to be able to use the product. I thought that this was a self-laminating product. It isn't worth the effort and cost of shipping to send it back, so I am stuck with a bunch of tags that I will not use.NOTE: even if I did have a laminating machine, I agree with the other reviewer that these seem too flimsy for what most people would probably use them for. As any traveler knows, baggage is handled roughly by airport personnel and I wouldn't trust one of these to stay attached to the tag holder in transit."
2,No se pierden nada.,"Este es el disco en donde se canta del Papa Juan Pablo II y el Che Guevara, dos ideologias totalmente opuestas. No hay nada nuevo, no hubo ningun sencillo que valiera la pena. La verdad, este album no tiene nada unico. Estoy seguro que el 90% de los fans de El Tri no pueden nombrar ninguna cancion que haya aparecido en este album. Lo siento pero escuchenlo y me entenderan."
3,"bad, just bad!","The story started out ok but never really picked up for me. The main character was too whiney and seemed silly rather than serious about having a baby. Her husband, James, was a real trooper through the whole ordeal. There is one big funny part where he gets a groin injury and she still wants to have sex! There were funny parts here and there but this isn't deep reading. I had hoped for more but nope - not this novel."
3,Good but annoying,"This is the author's debut. As far the writing goes, this is a wonderful book. The author manages to really involve us in the storyline of this couple who are somewhat desperately attempting to have a baby.However, the author needs to make her main character (Emma) a heck of a lot less annoying. Although I felt for Emma and her hubby not being able to conceive, the author managed to make me extremely dislike Emma.Emma was portrayed as increasingly infantile and I kept expecting her to start stamping her foot and holding her breath until the powers that be gave her what she wanted.I think if I had been her hubby or family, I would have smacked her. This removed alot of the pleasure of this book for me, hence the 3 stars.I think there would have been a few other ways to explain Emma's frustration without making her so annoying.Still, I would consider reading the next novel by this author."
3,"Hilarious Moments, Weird Ending","This is a tale of a young married woman in Dublin who can't seem to get pregnant and her attempts to do just that. The characters are attractive and Moriarty has written some hysterical scenes, but there is way too much specific information on fertility techniques for this to succeed completely as a novel. At one point, I checked to see if it was non-fiction!At the same time, I found it a fast and, for the most part, enjoyable read. The end seemed to peter out, so to speak, and so I docked it a star for that."
3,Disappointing,"The books starts out well. There is a lot hilarity in the heroine, Emma, and her direct approach to conceiving with her husband, James. The comparisons to the new mothers are particular funny, especially the loss of personality and humor. But it starts to fall apart towards the end when it fails to resound with the reality of infertility. The specialist comes across as a quack and Emma begins to be viewed as a tad psycho. It was hard for me to swallow that one year of attempting to conceive equated to infertility without any medical explanation, therefore the treatments seemed absurd. Suspending reality however, the secondary characters carried the book. Lucy, Donal, Babs, and Sean provide the comic relief and their own stories are fun to follow. I'd never couch this book as a waste of time, but at the same time, I'd never reread this book. The ending was disappointing with no real resolution to the story line."
3,REVIEW BABY TRAIL,"A lot of novels have been written on the Babyless subject, but this one had a different slant.It was easy to identify with the main characters, even if not one of the childless oneself, and the story was believable.A nice bedtime read, with a happy ending. A feel-good experience."
2,"Too much technical, not enough plot","I was dissapointed by this book... It's a quick read, but goes into way too much details about her fertility struggles with absolutely no other plotline, reflection, etc.... It's a stream of conciousness novel of her being a little too over-the-top neurotic for it to be believeable. The only side-plot, about her friend's dating, wasn't that interesting because I just didn't care enough about the characters. There are other books about fertility journeys that I've read -- by unknown authors --- that I liked better. (The Baby Trap is one of them)"
2,A sad waste of time...,"I laughed out loud a few times in the middle of this book and that's the only reason it got 2 stars. As it is, I was pretty enraged by the ending. And the main character's complete cluelessness about trying to conceive a child towards the beginning was downright maddening. For a while in the middle I thought it might turn out to be a worthwhile read, but sadly I was wrong. If I were you, I'd move on without giving this book a second thought. It's not worth your time."
3,Eehhh...,"This book is an okay read, kind of interesting in its portrayal of a couple going through fertility struggles but the ending was disappointing. I spent the entire book mired in their quest for a baby and at the end...(spoiler)....no baby. I felt like I (and the characters) had gone full circle and not in a satisfying way."
4,Funny read,"I laughed a lot through this book and thought it was pretty good. I did agree with the other reviewers and thought Emma was a little too annoying. And I found myself getting annoyed at her husband because his character wasn't involved enough. I found it unrealistic that after all this time of not getting pregnant, everyone kept saying, ""Don't worry, you're fine...these things take time."" I feel like in real life, a couple would've already have taken more drastic measures sooner than she had in the book. I guess I found it to be a bit monotonous with her still not getting pregnant and all. However there were many funny moments in the book and although Emma was annoying at times, her character was developed really well."
3,The Baby Trail,"The book was okay - almost as though the Uthor is writing to some formula which has been copied by many other CEO called "" chick lit"" authors of the day.Not very memorable and only mildly entertaining."
2,Caused me anxiety!,"I ordered this book thinking it would satisfy my craving for a book about getting pregnant and having a baby. Instead it stressed me out! Without giving anything away, this book deals more with the strain that trying to conceive can have on life, and I found myself getting anxious about my own conception journey, so to speak."
5,Well-documented researcher,"I see a few other reviewers saying that this book doesn't tell the ""other side of the story."" Well, that other side is presented to us daily in the media. THIS is the side we've been missing out on. An awesome book that gave me a better understanding of the conflict -- and, oddly, more peace about it. The author provides extensive documentation (much of it directly from Arab sources) and presents his arguments clearly."
1,A biased book and false facts!,"my mother is jewish and my father is catholic, they both read the book and were totally convinced that the writer is a very biased pro israel writer.Countless aquisations are written with no evidence to support it.He does not put forward the other sides point of view.This book is a total waste of time and money.Do not read it if you want to find out the REAL ""truth behind the headlines""!!!!"
5,Earglove Sport Stereo Headset,"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! I have a Verizon LG Navigator,and I wanted comfortable over the ear headset to listen to my music. Imagine my surprise when I found out that not only can I listen to music, but I can answer calls as well. The sound is great, the ear buds are very comfortable. Also included is a adapter so I can use the headset with my I-touch."
2,Not Good!,This was a lazy effort by McMurtry. No real beginning and definitely less than a sterling effort to end it.
3,"Not Especially Realistic, but his best.","As my title indicates, if this book were realistic, the kid would have shot the s.o.b. Hud when he caught him in a rape. The book would have ended there. It follows that although the rape was pure Hud, the kid, whom McMurtry didn't really intend to be a chicken, stepped out of character. A fatal defect. This book takes a lot of suspension of belief. It beats hell out of Lonesome Dove in which two Texas rangers, retired after twenty years service in the Rangers (as of the year they were officially formed) are cavoting along the Rio Grande at the little burg of Lonesome Dove, and there is not a tree to be found for twenty miles. Where was that along the Rio Grande? Today, of course, there are places where there's no water to be found for twenty miles. Is Larry kidding? I think so in every book he's written. An avid fan I ain't."
4,Great read,Enjoyed this one a lot!He is an entertaining author ; our whole family enjoys his work a lot. Hope there is more to come.
4,Enthralling Narrative,"I recently discovered this 'early' Larry McMurtry novel having read many of his later works. this rites of passage story is intriguing and disturbing. The narrator Lonnie and his family come to life in a series of illuminating episodes which are both nostalgic and contemporary. The character of Hud is unscrupulous and without any redeeming features save perhaps for his final actions which leave you wondering about his real motive. A colourful picture of Texas which is a graphic reminder of the Old West and its values, HORSEMAN PASS BY is unsettling and at the same time compulsive reading. Search it out now, you won't be disappointed. Oh, and forget the movie HUD - this is the real thing - and much better on the printed page."
4,What a life!!!,"I had never heard of Rubirosa until a friend recommended the book. I really enjoyed reading Rubi's memoirs, the FBI documents and the authors take on all the rumors. As I was reading the book, you could almost see the movie in your mind. Wonder why his ex wives and lovers didn't want to comment in the book. Hmmm."
5,read it and discuss with your book club AMAZING!!,"Wow! This story is an amazing tale about a true life playboy. Influencing political leaders, FBI tagging his tale trying to figure out how he got the MOST POWERFUL AND RICH WOMEN IN THE WORLD to marry him, while sustaining his affairs with famous actresses. Menus carrying dishes named after him referring to a specific body part is pretty impressive. The fact that most people are not aware of this man's story is appalling. I hope Oliver Stone makes this his next project because as I was reading this book that I couldn't put down, I couldn't help visualizing this character on the silver screen. It's a biography of a true life fantasy. A man's man, a woman's dream, FBI files revealed, interviews, photos, and a sad ending!! What more can you ask for...oh, yeah, it's a TRUE STORY!! Bring it to your local book club, I'm sure you'll have commentary for weeks!!"
5,great book,what a ride! a romantic romp through the world of the rich and famous! Hoping this book hits the silver screen. I LOVED IT!!!!
3,Thin Material,"I bought this as a gift and the material is somewhat translucent. So, unless you have it pinned to a wall, you'll see thru it. You'll also need to steam the seams out of the material after unpackaging. It may be fine for most people. I've seen better but likely more costly."
5,Then and Now and Forever,This is what Mark Murphy was meant to sing. He is the only living hipster that can do justice to Kerouac. Makes me want to get on the road to San Francisco.
4,Good.,"I had to read this book for my theater class. Fast shipping and no damage to the book. Overall, it is a pretty good story/production."
5,Amazing work,"M. Butterfly contains a sense of tranquility of tempo but with sharp and deep cuts of theatrical drama. I just found the play to be completely moving, shocking, and highly entertaining with the multiple perspectives underline themes of race, gender, and the love that is intertwined within it. A wonderful and beautiful piece of theatrical art."
4,Interesting,"I had to read this for a college course. It was a very quick read and very interesting. It is a great book to write a paper over because of all the gender themes as well. It's a little grotesque at times and definitely not moral, but you wont regret reading it. I would suggest it highly."
3,Let's be real,"Can you really believe he had sex with this ""woman"" (Butterfly) and didn't know she was a man ? Besides this crucial evasion most of the rest of this otherwise worthy attempt to portray the clash between oriental ( in this case Maoist) culture and that of the West seems rather footling. The final scene in which Gallimard imagines himself to be Butterfly and commits suicide in front of 200 French prison inmates is both unreal and foolish."
2,Not as pictured,The ISBN that came in was not the book that I needed nor was it the edition that I thought I was getting.
5,Great resource,I'm learning to make the vestments for our parish. This book has great drawings with measurements. The photos are a bit dark but still helpful.
2,Letter from a disappointed Diesel Boy fanatic:,"I loved Cock Rock. None of my friends would agree until I forced them to give it a chance. They all fell in line and gave up the mainstream crap to go buy Cock Rock. Unfortunately, I can't even find the desire to put Venus Envy in the CD player. I think they rushed this one. Sorry boys. Maybe Sofa King Cool will make it big."
2,"Pennywise, anyone?","Is it just me, or is the fourth track (Schmooziphisus the Great) a cheap ripoff of Pennywise's Date With Destiny (off the Full Circle album)? Very original."
3,"Some of this is a bit ""seedy"".","When ""The Seeds at Merlin's Music Box"" first came out I had it. At the time I thought it was a great album. Now...if it's true that they just recorded it in a studio and then added the ""crowd sound"" afterwards,I'd have to say it was a bit shady. As for the ""bonus"" tracks, some are a bit seedy and I could have done without some of them. I like ""Mr. Farmer"",""900 million people (all making love)"", and ""Pushing too hard"" but all in all, I probably would not get anymore of there music."
5,Dried cherries,I was so excited to find this product on Amazon! It's sometimes difficult in my area to find even the 5 oz. packages of dried cherries in the supermarket. These are delicious and I definitely will buy again.
2,dried cherries,"they are leathery, I did not care for them at all, they use to be better.I doubt I will purchase them again"
3,Nice dried Cherry but a little bit sour,"I bought two boxes of dried cherry for my Mum and myself as well. Both of us like it. However, I would like to say that it is a little bit sour, much suitable for matching with oats and walnuts as breakfast in the morning but finger or snack foods while watching TV. Recommend it!"
3,Be Careful,In the second handful I encountered a pit. Luckily this did not chip anything and all is well. The flavor is good but the pit is unacceptable.
5,Perfect Taste! Perfect Price!,"I must say, I was skeptical about purchasing this through Amazon and not the local grocery market. But, the price is what swayed me. I saved about $4.00/lb with purchasing through Amazon. The taste was perfect. Just like the cherries I buy in the store. I would recommend to anyone!"
5,Really enjoy these dried cherries,"I like craisins and other dried fruits that are chewy (like raisins, but raisins are kind of boring and common). These cherries are fantastic. I've received a couple orders so far and shipping and packaging are perfect. They come in a single 4 pound bag, so I split them into smaller bags or one big zip lock bag. I sometimes give them out as gifts (a sandwich baggy full) and people are really happy to receive them and have many different things they use them for, from baking (biscotti) to just eating them as a snack. I like them as snacks and as toppings on cereal.I probably would not purchase these at normal price (only because I am on a tight budget). I am accustomed to getting them at a discount and a subscribe & save discount (total ~ $20 + free shipping)."
3,Too candy-like for me,"They are pretty good if you want something sweet like candy. I personally think they are too sweet. They taste like a sweeter version of raisins. Like gummy candies you can buy from the store.They are decent quality for what they are, but they're not my thing."
2,Disappointing,"After not finding the dried cherries at Costco, I decided to give these a try. In comparison to those from Costco, these are dry and tasteless. The price was fine, but the quality was not. Try buying the Kirkland brand for moist, tart and absolutely delicious dried cherries."
2,Way too sweet,"I bought these cherries based on all the positive reviews on Amazon, but I guess I have different tastes than most the reviewers here.The cherries are way, way too sweet. It really detracts from the actual flavor and tartness.Maybe if there was half the sugar in them than what it has now, they would taste much better."
5,Great taste.,"I am 86 and have arthritis in my right knee. Heard tart cherries are helpful for that, so am giving that a try. The cherries are very tasty."
3,Great value but just ok for dried cherry snob.,"I guess for the price, these are good. My husband likes them to mix in his cereal/oats, etc. I have had some killer cherries before so I'm comparing these to the ""others"". If you are not a dried cherry snob such as myself, you will probably enjoy these. I find them to be too oily and too sweet, with the feeling of being ""over processed"". They are lacking the powerful intense cherry flavor that I adore. However, those which I speak of come at a real premium. The perfect balance of sweet and tart without the oiliness are hard to find, and very expensive as well.Still, for the price I would give these 5 stars for what you get. Still better than those that are available at your local chain grocer.For those of you who love dried cherries but aren't snobs like me, this is the way to go."
1,overrated,A real disappointment. I normally buy Kirkland Signature dried montmorency cherries from Costco. The Costco cherries have a much brighter flavor and a nice tart sweet snap at the end. These taste dull almost raisin like initially with a hint of cherry at the end.
5,"finally, TART dried cherries","tried several brands of dried tart (""sour"") cherries, but the preservation process always added sugar to the point of candy-sweetness. These are actually sour; terrific for baking (which is why I ordered them)& ADDICTIVE tangy snacking. Yes, a large quantity, but they stay soft in airtight containers, in cool or cold storage. EXCELLENT VALUE."
3,All right but nothing special,"If you happen to dote on dried very tart cherries I suppose this is better quality than some. It disappointed us after all the good reviews. The texture was like very large raisens. The taste was not just tart but really sour. The only sweetness was from the added sugar, not the cherry juice you might expect. I think you'd have to be a special sour cherry lover to enjoy snacking on this product, and I don't think most kids would go for it. I'm not sure we'll be able to finish our first order."
5,Perfect sweet/sour,Perfect combo of sweet and sour. No sulphates used in drying. Great snack instead of fruit snacks! I will purchase again!
2,4 pound box of Dried Cherres,"I would not recommend this company as the bag arrived and when I weighed it, it was 3 ounces short of the 4 lbs that I paid for. That makes an expensive item even more expensive."
2,Off Taste,I purchased this product because I got tired of buying the 6 ounce packages of Sunkist dried cherries. I am somewhat disappointed in this product because the sunflower oil used to prevent sticking during storage gives an initial off taste. Luckily this initial off taste disappears soon after sucking the cherries and then they have a very good flavor. I consume a lot of dried cherries and I will not purchase this product again. Sunkist dried cherries don't have this initial off taste (even though they also contains sunflower oil). It turns out that the cost per pound is not much different when shipping and handling is considered.
2,stale,"The cherries are NOT particularly tart, instead are overly sweetened. To make matters worse, the oil that's used as an anti-clumping agent was old and stale, so the cherries taste and smell like rancid oil. You might get by if you just cook with them, but they are unpleasant to eat raw."
3,"Dried Cherries, first great, then good, now... sour.","Bought these three times. Initially they were sweet and plump (like someone else noted). The second time, they seemed a bit more sour, but still quite delish. I just got my third box, and they are small, sour and tasteless. You can see that a lot of them are lighter red color, meaning they have been harvested before they matured. Now I have twenty-five bux worth of sour things sitting in a box. Still edible, but I am going to see if I can use them when brewing beer or cooking something. Meh."
5,I bought this to make cherry wine,I wanted to try a batch of cherry wine but couldn't stand the thought of pitting 100000 cherries. This seemed almost ideal. Had to guess the dry to fresh weight ratio since information is not readily available. 1lb dry equals 3lbs fresh seemed like reasonable estimate so a box of cherries should yield 4 gallons of wine. Good recipes are on the web so look it up. Batch is 6 weeks old and seems promising. Dry & slightly tart. Maybe ready to share with friends by Christmas time.Update: 1st trial of one box resulted in18 bottles of cherry wine. Oct - pretty good. Nov - better. Probably will wait till Valentine's to share. So 6 months or more from mixing to sharing.
4,Quality Item,"I've order these a couple of time. Good product, fresh and well packaged. Suppose to be good for joints, whatever, taste good added to 7 grain hot cereal."
5,Delicious!,"I love dried cherries in my morning oatmeal and have been buying Costco's Kirkland brand for years. Last time I shopped at Costco, they didn't have the Kirkland brand Montmorency dried cherries. So, I bought the replacement - dried Bing cherries. They were absolutely awful. I'm not sure what those dried up things were and not really sure they were ever attached to a cherry tree because they didn't taste like any cherry I've ever eaten.So, I started shopping on Amazon and these cherries sounded good and for the most part had good reviews. I am so glad I bought the Traverse Bay dried cherries. They are GOOD! I bagged up part of them for freezer storage since it will take me awhile to eat all of these cherries. My oatmeal is going to be a lot better tomorrow morning!"
5,Very nice Cheeries,"Dried Cherries are very tasty, set it to deliver every two month at first, just totry it out, right now I need to make it deliver every month. Yes, it is good."
4,Very pleased with the order.,"What can be said about a food product?The color of the cherries are uniform and a nice color. The taste is not too sweet and not too tart. It is really the perfect balance. I've used these by putting a handful in my morning oatmeal and also alone for a snack.If any one you make home ice cream this would be a great addition to vanilla ice cream. Or even added to a pie.The only thing I would change about this product is the internal packaging. It would be nice if the bags was resealable.Traverse Bay Fruit Co. Dried Cherries, 4-Pound Box"
5,Cherries Galore,"Four pounds of cherries seemed like alot to orderI have used them in baking,In my morning cream of wheat and ""snacking"" at the computer.It was easy to bag them in sealable sandwich bags.I have found that cherries are excelent to relieve Arthritic pains."
3,Disappointed!,"Definitely you can not eat it from the package. With the extra vegetable oil, it s just for cooking only! Very disappointed! I gave it 3 star because of the price. But now I dont know what I can do with the whole 4pounds!"
3,Like prunes,With all the great reviews I guess I set my expectations pretty highIt has a very similar taste to prunes with a little more cherry tangy kissThe cherries are not order wholes but shredded to tiny pieces and unidentifiable until tasted. I presume this is for cereal muffins or oatmeal. Makes me wonder if the reviews are from an older target audience... The Prune enjoying typeOrdered another box to make sure the dealer didn't cut my cherries with prunes and yep same results
3,Tastes more like candy then cherries,Too sweet and candy-like taste. Also quite dry. I don't know how other people found these cherries juicy. I compared these to a pack of cherries bought at Costco (slightly higher price). Those from Costco have real cherry taste and are juicy. Three stars only for low price. Otherwise I would have given two stars.
1,disappointed and outraged,"A month ago my order arrived in a box that looked like it was crushed and laid in water in a corner of a warehouse. The cherries were bitter and dried, unlike the prior two orders around Christmas. Then yesterday they charged me again even though I didn't reorder, which caused me to overdraft my bank account. Frustrated and disappointed."
4,"Good to the very last ""chop""","Although tart,( good tart) the cherries are excellent as ""extra's"", and most importanly ,as a side fruit snack."
3,VERY SWEET,"Maybe it's my fault for not reading the description well enough, but they are really sweet. Without a sweet tooth, these were hard for me to eat. Plus, I didn't think to check if they were organic, which is a must for me and fruit. However, it's a large amount and goes a long way for the price. Next time I'd order unsweetened organic tart cherries (for inflammation) from another source."
3,Why would they put vegetable oil in cherries?,"My biggest beef with this product is that they took one of my favorite and one of the healthiests fruits, and ruined it with processed vegetable oil. Was there really a need for that?The price is definitely great for that big of a box of cherries, but I will simply not buy it because I don't want to be consuming anything with vegetable oil in it.Plus, it kind of defeats the purpose of even buying dry cherries. Isn't it suppose to be a way to preserve product for a long time vs. buying fresh? So why mix it with another product that easily goes rancid with a change in temperature or time?"
3,Good but...,"If you're looking for sweet, candy-like dried cherries you'll like these. If you want tart, dried cherries look elsewhere."
2,AWARE! The qualiy/taste is not consistent. Shipped from different farms.,We really loved the first batch. The dried cherries tasted organic and fresh. So we ordered second box and found it was shipped from a different farm because the inner package was different. Their product was loaded with SUGAR and tasted artificial and cheap. We are very reluctant to purchase any more from this company because of the inconsistency of the product!
4,Michigan Cherries,"Great Bargain! Put some in a bowl for snacks, then place the rest in zip lock bags and into the refrigerator. The stock of cherries has lasted months, and they are just a nice as the day they arrived."
5,Worthwhile Cherries,"I have found that the cherries from Traverse Bay area of Michigan are the best anywhere. Living in Albuquerque, we cannot get such wonderful cherries locally, so I order them on-line from Amazon/Traverse Bay Dried Cherries. They are wonderful in salads, oatmeal, and they are the best in cookies, especially oatmeal cookies with walnuts, raisins and dried cherries. When we go to potlucks, everyone always asks for our oatmeal cookies with the cherries. The four-pound box lasts better part of a year, and they stay very fresh in the bag in which they are delivered. I have bought them in Michigan when I have visited there, and the price on Amazon is a good deal."
2,Too sweat to eat...,"Not exactly I want, and it's way too sweat. I don't really like it, and the pack is too big. I am having a headache taking care of 4 pounds since it did not taste good, as least to me..."
5,Best Dried Cherries!,These are the only dried cherries that I will purchase. I have tried others and the Traverse Bay are more moist and have a much better flavor. They are great for cooking or for a snack!! The four pound box is a great deal too!
5,Traverse Bay Dried Cherries,"These are sweet/tart and free from preservatives, They taste like cherry pie without the crust and are a treat for those of us who must remain gluten and chemical free."
5,Top of the Line,"Hubby & I eat these delicious cherries as a treat and a treatment for arthritis on a daily basis. Eat a handful or add to salads, muffins, pancakes, breads, etc. Good and good for you!"
5,Best Dried Cherries Anywhere,"These cherries are the best you can get anywhere. I spend time in Traverse City where they are grown and dried and always bring a box home with me. They are great on salads, in cookies, and just out of the bag! Glad they are available to ship...one box never lasts long in our house."
3,AUSTRALIAN GLAZED APRICOTS,"AS A LONG TIME USER OF THE PRODUCT, I HAVE HAD MUCH BETTER APRICOTS. THESE APRICOTS ARE NOT AS FIRM AND ARE MUCH MORE MOIST THAN THE APRICOTS I HAVE PREVIOUSLY USED.THEY ARE O.K. BUT NOT WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER A GRADE ""A"" PRODUCT."
1,Do they forget to put sugar into my cherries?,"After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try, but was very disappointed. The reviews said it was sweet, or over sweet. yet mine was very tart. Don't know if they forget to put sugar in my cherries. :("
1,Dried Cherries,"I am completely disappointed. I bough this cherries for health reason especially for my hubby suffering from gout, and to my chagrin I fund that they are full of sugar, and oil to which my hubby is allergic to. What a bomber, Knowing this, We have no reason to eat them. Sincerely, Eliana."
1,old the worse product ever,i just got it and it is old and does not worth it...the taste is not as good either i did not get it why they get so many 5 stars rating......................it is the worse product i have ever bought from online everdo not waste your money... some people compare this with grocery stores dried cherries ..... funny.... this product sucks big big time
3,Bait and Switch?,"I ordered a box of these and was delighted with the perfect mix of sweet/tart with genuine cherry coming through. When the second box arrived, I found the cherries to be oily and with an ambiguous flavor - more like dried prunes than dried cherries. I am signed up for an automatic monthly shipment but will be cancelling if the third box is no better than the second. I gave the product three stars based on the first box, which would have been a five. The second box gets one star."
5,delicious tart and sweet cherries,dont hesitate to purchase these - these are wonderful. tart and sweet and delicious. these are very cost effective compared to paying $4.00 for 5oz in the grocery store and taste just as good.
2,dried cherries,"I wish I was more positive, but I am not really happy with the product. I have bought Traverse Bay Cherries in the past. These cherries have an off taste as if they have been in storage too long and are far too over plump as to suggest extra sugar has been added to increase weight. Michigan cherries from Traverse Bay has been an excellent product in the past. I suspect these are second rate in some fashion."
5,nice flavor,"Good and good for you. I got them to add to my daily oatmeal, but have found myself snacking on them a lot more often than that. A nice flavor. If you like cherries, raisins, or dried fruit, you'll enjoy these.These are also a great addition to trail mix."
5,Can you eat 4 pounds of cherries...YES!,"I stumbled upon these on Amazon and went for it not knowing what I was going to do with 4 pounds of dried cherries. When they came I began eating them and didn't stop until they were gone. I'm not sure how long it took but it was probably less than a month and they were gone. They are VERY good. Great in salads, making your own trailmix or just by the handful. Traverse City, MI knows cherries and these are the best I've had."
5,YUMMY!!!,These are sooooo fresh and delicious! The price is definitely affordable and the cherries are worth every cent.I love the cranberries more (and give them a 10) but these cherries are definitely a 9.99 :)))Arrived QUICK and in excellent shape.Thank-you Amazon!
2,2.5 pounds of sugar,Just checked the Travis Bay web site.Every 100 grams of product contains 61 grams of sugar.That means that you are getting two and a half pounds of sugar in each four pound box.They carry unsweetened cherries at their web site.
5,Nice sweet but not too sweet dried cherries,I have been buying these for the past few years when I catch them on sale. Retail prices on dried cherries are just outrageous so these are a great deal with Subscribe and Save.They are sweet but not cloyingly sweet like a few brands that I have tried. I have one box that stayed sealed in the box for a few months and when I opened it they were still nice and soft and not dried out and chewy as well.These are great in baked goods and my kids love it when I put these in our morning oatmeal or when making cookies to add in a change of pace from Oatmeal Raisin cookies.Overall its a great deal for the price and they keep fresh for a long time as well which is an added plus.
1,Inconsistent and unreliable!,"The directions are very poorly done...very difficult to relate to the operation of the unit. I purchased some calibrated uranium ore to test this gadget with and found the results to be totally unreliable and very inconsistent. I ended up returning it to the vendor and purchasing their next level up unit called the 'Monitor 4' which performs GREAT (it was also almost double the cash, but I guess you get what you pay for). The vendor was a pleasure to deal with."
1,"fragile, customer service very poor","The screen broke within a day while being carried in a pocket, rendering the device basically unusable. The agents for the product in Japan insisted from the start that the only possible reason was customer misuse and were generally unpleasant to deal with. (The instructions are also in terrible English and the readings differ markedly from those of more sophisticated devices, but then proper accuracy is difficult at this kind of price).#"
1,I do not recomend this product-RADEX RD1503,"Not sensitive enough to be practical. I consider it usless. Did not come with batteries, as advertised. The manufacture refused to refund my money; offering to accept as trade-in on a more expensive model or possibly repair if they though it was defective after examining it."
4,MesSurements1,The item ocurres to my expectations yet the difference between beta and gamMa beams I can not instruate.And there happens to be no availabillity of a list of rates to refear to.
1,Low cost and low quality too!,"I was prepared that this low cost geiger counter may not be too accurate. I wasn't prepared that this geiger counter did not work at all. Even worse, almost as soon as i plug in batteries, it started to overheat.Since never in my life have I seen this happen, I stupidly openned it and pulled the hot batteries out (one of which already seems leaking) with my hands. Later I noticed that my hand were itching, so I washed my hands a lot which helpedThis is a low quality product, made in Russia. Not worth $150, not worth FREE, because it's so dangerous. So buyers be ware."
1,Boring,"I concur with Mr. Zwick's review below, but I give it one and a half stars, rounded down to one. It was just dull, dull, dull."
3,Standard disaster movie,"What can I say about this movie? Disaster strikes the plane. Just because it is a full moon do not let the title distract you from the plot. Some planes have mechanical problems. Some planes have snakes. Some planes have time travel problems. This one has - well watch and see.This is a 2000 TV movie so it will have the standard 2000 TV movie actors. The lines are standard. We have the standard bad guys including Daniel Baldwin with his stoic face and the standard carrying person. Only this time she (Penelope Ann Miller) is not a discredited fringe scientist; she is just misplaced. Will the doomsayer passenger bet slapped like in ""Airplane"" or will he finally survive to annoy the world?If you have some time to kill, add this to your standard disaster list."
4,Another Survival Story,"Killing Moon is another survival story. I happen to like that sort of thing, so I thought it was very good. It has some really good personal stories about the characters within the main story line of the film. However it does have enough action to keep you from getting bored. I think it has something for the man and the woman of the house.The cover could be somewhat misleading. It looks like the cover of a horror flick, but this is definately not a horror movie!"
1,Ouch!,"Well, the movie starts at the Molokai airport (yeah, the island exactly 50 nautical miles from Honolulu International). Couple of problems, though - the concourse shots had to be taken at Honolulu (Molokai is a pleasant ""little"" airport), and it was a 1-hour flight from Molokai to Honolulu in a 737. Hmmm, that works out to 50 knots, not too fast for a 737! And from there, the entire movie went downhill. Only redeeming grace was that the ineptness was initially quite humorous, but by a half hour into the movie (and I guess the flight) even the humor aspect failed. Buh-Bye."
4,Gracie's the best!,"The only problem here is the inclusion of the 80's (YAWN) empty-headed MOR songs ""Nothing's gonna Stop us now"" - and We Built this City. So un-Slick. But you get ""Rejoyce"" - Gracie's musical version of Joyce predating Sinead O 'Connor about 1,000 trips. The classics are here also as are Lather, Triad, Mexico, and Law Man. It's rather sad to see how she went from psychedelic revolutionary goddess in White Rabbit to empty, banal balladeer in Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now. They should have included Greasy Heart and Eat Starch Mom instead. But her voice is still unparalleled."
2,I don't like the feet,Go for a ball without the feet. Other balls of the same size seem to inflate bigger. This one is made of thicker material. I switch to a feetless brand and use it a typing chair.
4,Very detailed explanation of prophecy. It changed my view on end times.,"Many of the things I have been taught about the tribulation, number of the beast, rapture and the end times have been reshaped by reading this book. It is so detailed that it can be overwhelming to take it all in but it is well worth taking the time to study. Many of the of the events that are associated with the end times have actually already taken place. This book shows specific hostorical events that are clearly spelled out in prophecy. I strongly recommend this book. It is not a casual read. It is work to take it all in but it has a great pay off."
5,Motorola battery door,"Thank you Amazon.I was looking for an Motorola extended battery door for my I880 cell phone for about two months.I live in a large city and could not find one any where.I looked on ebay and in order to get the door you had to buy the battery with it.I looked in Amazon and it was the same thing even after doing searches.Then finaly Amazon must have got some in stock,BINGO I ordered it right away. after I got it in the mail I put it on tne phone and it snaped right into place.Thanks again."
1,"Sink, not float","I purchased this product for my 12 month old to introduce him to the water in a fun and safe way, and changed my mind quickly. As soon as I put him in, it began to tip and sink. The only way to keep him afloat was for me to hold it up (which took quite some effort), and in that case, there's no point in having a float at all! I give this product 1 star accross the board because it's not safe, not enjoyable, and definitely not worth the measly [money] that they charge you. Sometimes cheap isn't the way to go."
3,Fun in the sun,"While this toy helped to keep my son out of the sun a little bit, it did not cover him completely. Occasionally, he would fall backward or forward in the seat so I had to really watch him as I pulled him around the pool. Overall, not a bad float for the money. At the time, my son was only 5-6 months old. Perhaps this would work really well with a child slightly older."
3,Ok for very young swimmers.,My daughter enjoyed this but I think the palm tree does not really provide as much shade as I had hoped.
3,Baby's Tropical Island,"Overall, I was pleased with this product, the product does float and support my infant well. It is colorful, and provides some shade; However, the three little toy balls that are attached with a string in the front came off in the water. It comes with a patch kit in the event of a puncture.We were happy to be able to find a this product online as all local stores in our area were out of stock."
3,LOOKING FOR SHADE,"MY MAIN REASON FOR BUYING THIS ITEM WAS TO PROVIDE SHADE FOR MY DAUGHTER, BUT AFTER BLOWING IT UP FOR THE SECOND TIME THE PALM TREE SPRUNG A LEAK ENDING IT'S USEFULLNESS."
2,Fun in the sun,My 2-year-old enjoyed this floaty because of the beads and the fact that it allowed her to enjoy the swimming pool without my having to worry about her. My only disappointment with the floaty is the fact that the palm tree doesn't really help to sheild her from the hot sun. She quickly became bored enough with the floaty to attempt climbing out of it while still in the pool.
5,Amazing,"This book is a large-scale study of arthritis which can serve as a catalog of arthritis treatments available. For each treatment, the book states what percentage of patients got better, showed no improvement, or felt worse. Also shows symptoms for each type of treatment. Ironically, exercise turned out to be one of the safest and most effective way to deal with arthritis. This book discusses drugs, surgery, various categories of medical professionals, and traditional and some alternative approaches. A great gift for friends who have arthritis but don't know what to do about it."
2,No comparison to the Remake.,"I went to see the remake of this movie about 3 weeks ago because the previews looked so good. I was NOT disappointed. I was a VERY GOOD movie...one that I will purchase when it comes out to add to my collection. However, people started telling me (and from what I read on line at High Def Digest)that if I like the remake...that the original was much better. Therefore, I bought the original on line at Amazon for 11.99 because I could not find any place that still had it for rent. I have to tell you that I was NOT please with this version at ALL! This version is NO way better than the Remake. It was just BAD all the way around. This was obviously a ""pay-check"" movie for Dustin Hoffman.The only good thing about this version is that the Blu Ray is outstanding to say that the movie is about 40 yrs old. My advice is to wait for the Remake version...you will be much happier. I am going to sell this original version I bought ASAP! What a terrible movie!!!"
4,a classic,Sam Peckenpah was many years ahead of the pack and Dustin Hoffman was brilliant in this movie.
3,exactly what is all the fuss about?,"I watched this movie after the case talked about how violent and controversial this film was, but what the heck? Peckinpah uses slow motion to express the violence, but it don't make it any more disturbing. I read a review saying it was more overboard then his earlier classic, The Wild Bunch, but, by all means, the bullet in the back of the head overpowers all the violence in this film by far. Good film, but far over-fussed."
2,Straw Dogs (The Original),I recently saw the remake of Straw Dogs so I was curious about the original since I saw it several years ago and couldn't really remember it that well. It was boring and not anywhere near as good as the remake!
3,"Nice setting and first half, but stupid ending.morelike 2.5*","I just saw the film, and I thought that it started off great with the bullying techniques of the locals. That was very true to life, since some of us might be in the same sort of situation. HOwever, the final confrontation was pathetic in the least. I really don't care much for peckinpah's action style, and it failed me even more here. The setting was great though, being in the northern part of England i suppose. I guess you should read the book if you enjoy the movie, they're always better, and adaptations are fairly easy and anemic in comparison. The film also dragged and is very aged. The actress did a perfect acting job though. Dustin was NOT the correct actor for the job though. I mean, the timid to kickass change was stupid, and there was no way he could keep 5 men out his house IRL."
1,I fail to see what the fuss was all about,"Upon seeing this film on its rerelease, I fail to see what the all the fuss this movie generated was about. Shaky camerawork and the dimly lit foggy environments don't make the film any easier to watch. Hoffman's performance is subdued and reserved and too easily overpowered by the villains' over the top performances. Definately not one of Peckinpah's best, although the film's violence does bear his distinct style."
1,GLAD IT'S BANNED,"The BBFC probably banned this film in England because it's so poor. The acting is wooden, which is a shame because Hoffman is a stunning actor. The rest of the cast just act like trees and the plot is full of holes. The only thing this film has going for it is the nice country setting - and the giant mantrap. Sadly this is not a good film."
4,"Better DVDs Make This Better, Too","I didn't really appreciate this movie until several viewings when a good print of this film finally came out on DVD. Since then, even a better one came out on Criterion and who knows, maybe we'll even get a great Blu-Ray transfer some day. The old VHS tapes of this film were awful.I have to admit: watching Susan George is one of the big enjoyments of this movie. She is hot! In reality, it's doubtful someone like her would marry a nerd like the character played by Dustin Hoffman, although that ""nerd"" comes out of his shell in the suspense-filled last half hour.This is one of those early `70 films that broke ground and shocked a lot of people. It's still an intense, uncomfortable movie, some 38 years after it was first released."
4,"What is a ""straw dog"" anyway?","""Inside the eyes of a coward burns a straw dog""...OK, now what does that mean in plain English?I saw this movie twice when it came out and once again recently. It's true, as others have noted, that what was so shocking in '71 seems pretty much par for the course by today's standards (though I still wouldn't call it ""tame"" exactly). At the time, it certainly seemed like a blow to the peace and love ethic of the 60s.As a visceral experience, the movie retains quite a bit of power. As a character study, it seems a bit heavy handed today. It's also a bit sketchy (e.g. just why DID they come to Cornwall anyway?). Still recommended as an early-70s artifact and as an important work in both Hoffman's and Peckinpah's oeuvres. (Also interesting to note how many somewhat familiar English actors crop up in the film.)"
5,great seller,"Thank you for a great transaction. The item was shipped in a timely manner and was in new condition. Very reliable seller, I would buy again from this seller."
2,Disappointed!!,"As a fan of Hoffman's and of Peckinpah's, I was extremely disappointed with ""Straw Dogs."" The violence, by today's standards, is over rated and not really that bad. The film was banned for reasons unclear to me. Even the rape scene is not bad in comparison to say ""Irreversible."" Too much hype here. Hoffman's performance especially towards the end of the film is amazing and is this film's only redeming quality in my opinion. The build up lasts almost an hour and finally when things begin to happen, it was not worth the wait. The characters are put in a situation that seemed ridiculous to me. Beware of this film. You might not find what you had expected or were hoping for. As I did."
2,Straw dogs is for the dogs,"I began reading this novel and couldn't get past the first 100 pages. It seemed like a good story though so I bought this DVD. Maybe it went over better in the 70's, but really this movie is just not good. While watching it with a friend, we had to fight back the urge to hit the next chapter button. It just seemed a very slow and dull movie. Even when there is action, it's kind of boring. When all the men attack the house, Dustin Hoffman sets up many traps and it's pretty much just a 1970's Home Alone. I think Home Alone is better though."
4,Wait! Don't turn it off yet....stay for the ending.,"Straw Dogs was one of the boringest films I had seen in some time (first forty five minutes). The last forty minutes, or so, was so intense I barely took a breath (afterall, Sam Peckinpaugh did direct it). A very good study of the human animal's potential for violence no matter how tame they might appear. Good performance from Dustin Hoffman."
3,Hopelessly dated.,"I see 1971 written all over the film. One of the much discussed in their time movies that failed to reach the classic status. Bleak, monotonous and ultimately disappointing. If you want to see the really exciting thriller about a bespectacled underdog who had to resort to violence and turned into a fierce avenger rent Le Vieux Fusil (1975,The Old Rifle) with Romy Schneider and Philippe Noiret."
3,"Too drawn out, but I can see why it's a classic.","I know that, for it's time, this was one shocking movie.And I dont judge by todays standards (Not that there are many left..).I think it's so annoying that Hoffman's character is such a pussy, and even after so much has been done to push him, he still tries to keep his cool! His role blank and underplayed... but then again, isn't that you end up screaming at the T.V. screen for him to do something about the lynch mob?!!! Good play. On the whole, it's not that bad, and I prefer Older movies to anything that's come out since the 90's. [...] It's like he only had to give her a good talking to to get her consent."
3,What's the big deal?,"I just saw this video, and I wasn't very impressed. The violence wansn't shocking or graphic, really. And since the Amazon reviewer mentioned it, Clockwork Orange was a much better study of violence. I would say that Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid stands as Peckinpah's best film. Despite everything I have said, Hoffman, as usual, was excellent."
5,Passive Aggressive Masterpiece,"Great Criterion release of a much abused classic. Great writing, editing (sound and picture) and acting. Great commentary from Peckinpah expert gives insight to this masterpiece. Also, good Peckinpah documentary included."
4,another violent peckinpah classic,"Although not as wholesome as his masterpiece ""The Wild Bunch"" this peculiar and controversial drama is the ultimate exercise in beefing up the home defense. No where near as graphic by today's standards the brutality is still respectable. The one aspect of the film I don't clearly understand is Susan George's character. One minute she is faithful, the next she isn't, and then the next minute she's taking pleasure and then displeasure in a tag team rape...strange. Other than that Hoffman puts in a decent performance and may the cat in the closet R.I.P."
4,Put me right to sleep!,"In high school, I listened to this as my ""go to sleep"" CD. I remember hearing that some sort of routine will help you fall asleep faster (I'm always looking for ways to fall asleep faster!).And, no lie, it worked LIKE A CHARM.I don't know why I stopped listening to this album. But the whales, the cheesy flute music... so soothing... so lulling... I was out like a light in 10 minutes."
3,Do you like your Humpback with flutey early-90s music?,"A very relaxing album. The music can be a little cheesey in places, but the underlying sounds of the whales redeem it. I actually think the highlight of the album is the ten minute track of the Southern Humpback's song played without musical supplementation."
4,Good for wide feet,"I have wide feet and I feel like my feet are hanging off the edge of the bike pedals because they actually are. Tried ""wider"" platform prdals, but they are wider front to back. I needed wider side to side. Found these and decided to give them a try. Put them on my Specialized Hardrock 29er. They were the ticket. My feet are completely on the pedals, a nice feeling. Would have given 5 stars, but they seem a bit pricey. Will buy another pair for my other bike."
5,bicycle riding is now 90% better,"wow....didn't thing these things were going to make such a difference. Probably one of the best purchases I have made for my bicycle! I wear size 14-15 mens shoes and my feet generally line up angled with my toes to the outside. these pedals keep heels from hitting/rubbing the back tire and my feet are now sitting comfortable on the pedal. would have happily paid 10 bucks for these, but gladly got them for under 3."
4,It worked,I bought this product because the side of my feet keeps rubbing on the bike frame. After a relatively easy installation my feet no longer rubs the frame.
5,quick fix for wide feet,What a great idea! I bought these extensions and they go on in a jiffy and allow you to cover the pedal with your wide feet. I actually bought some wider pedals for another bike and spent over $40 for the pedals and they aren't as good as this fix.8-30-12 update.. just purchased my second set of these and find them the cure to wide feet and small pedals on bikes. Lots of folks have asked me about them and I give them a redirect to Amazon. I wear a 12 4EE shoe size and this is just the fix for me. I have had no issues and find the added width a welcome on my bike rides.
1,Right Idea - Wrong Product!,"The concept of being alerted when a child moves or is removed from a protected area is very ingenius. The failure of a system to achieve such a claim is extremely dangerous by producing only a false sense of security for the adult guardian or parent if the system falls short of those claims . This is the case for the Child Guard Electronic Child Leash. Although the system worked at times, it was extremely unreliable by giving false alerts or no alert at times when that alert would be needed the most. Although the price was very reasonable, I feel that the the dangerous assumptions of reliability by the concerned adult for this product , could lead to a tragic situation if the product failed to alert that guardian or parent at the most critial time. The product would command a much higher price if it performed the functions claimed in a much more reliable manner."
2,"Shoddy editing, should be a freebie","This Kindle edition is a disgrace. No whitespace between paragraphs often makes it hard to understand who is saying or doing what, or even what's happening. I can imagine someone editing a free book for Kindle in a hurry doing a job like this, but this is a book that's pretty expensive. Since writers get 30 percent of the sales -soon even 70 I think- they should take responsibility for how their work is sold.Mr. Deaver, show us what you are made of! Oversee the editing yourself and let everyone who bought this Kindle edition based on your good name as an author have a refund or a properly edited book.The book itself would get 5 stars from me (I read the paperback years ago and liked it), but the shoddy editing job takes away three of those stars for the Kindle edition."
1,Jeffery Deaver Kindle Books Over priced!,"Buy a paperback, or check out a used book store. Paying almost $10 for books that have been in print for 10-15 years is a HUGE RIP-OFF by Deaver, his publisher and Amazon!"
2,Awfully bad,As many books the beginning of this one is excellent. But as you go over and over it gets boring and boring. The book has four stories that at the end will meet and all of them are stark boring. And at the end... just skip it. Better'd be if you skip this book.
3,bloody river blues,"The story flowed well. It didn't have the ""great"" shocker ending I expect from Deaver, but it was an interesting ending."
2,Steer Clear of the Algebreic Version,"The older editions of this book are wonderful. Tarrash's teaching methods are both unique and powerful. Unfotunately the ""amatuers"" that tried to reformat the new algebreic version essentially trashed it! Juxtaposition a Dover copy with the ""new"" version and see for yourself. If only they would have solicited some advice from John Nunn with respect to typesetting, or failing that, just convert the descriptive notation to algebreic. An opportunity missed."
