1,Boils over and makes a big mess.,I have to agree with the other review. I was excited about my new rice pot. I have a large family and this makes lots of rice. So far we have only made the 4 cups and it boiled over twice. I don't know what kind of mess I would have if I attempted to make the 6 cups. Not recommended.
4,Mixing Bowls,Good value. The lids are handy for storing leftovers in the fridge. The bowls nestle well when storing in cabinet.
5,Lakeside comfort,My wife loves this cushion for her chaise lounge....Many a picture on the dock enjoying the comfort it brings to slumming at the lake.....
1,mein kamph for the hip hop generation,"The lionization of this pusher of identity politics and victimhood is a sad commentary on the so-called ""hip-hop nation"",the agenda driven media like MTV (who gives this racist and self described ""minister of informatin"" undeserved legitimacy),and our universities who allow and invite this race baiter to sow his seeds of hatred to impressionable youth. Coincidentally, another minister of information, Joseph Goebbels also emphasized the youth.....hmmmmm."
2,Nothing new here.,"I purchased this DVD against my better judgment. The idea that any of my money might find its way into the Pockets of the man behind this production just didn't sit well.Next time I'll listen to that inner voice.There is nothing here any more ground breaking or earth shattering than there is on your average TV special on the subject. Nothing I ""Knew"" about the topic changed and the film didn't take me deeper into the world of Bigfoot. If the same old rehashed reports, (""I saw Bigfoot...he walked like this...I was a-skeered"") and uneven, overly dramatic footage from the field are what passes for what is new and exciting in Bigfoot research, then maybe this IS the Citizen Kane of Bigfoot documentaries.If you have ever watched more than one History Channel or A&E; show on the topic of Bigfoot then you have already seen this film.Once again, the grandiose claims of Mr. Biscardi fall FAR short of the truth."
1,ugh....what a scam,I just sat through 80 minutes of semi-intriguing footage and then they ended it with a blair witch style cliffhanger to force you to buy the next dvd. I might have been convinced if not for that little BS trick. I want a refund for the hour and 20 minutes of life wasted!!
1,Most of the evidence here are explainable,I was in this documentary. Every piece of evidence in this film has had a legitimate explanation. Of course the documentary spins it like it's a mystery. They never say what something is.
2,Not Worth Watching,"I was not paying to much attention to whom actually did the documentary. When I realize it was Tom Biscardi, the one that claim of the Georgia Bigfoot Hoax in the freezer. I was upset with myself for wasting my time and money."
5,Great Documentary,"I must say first I was involved in a very small way in Bigfoot Lives. When I viewed the video, what captivated me the most is the REAL stars of the movie, were the witnesses.In this documentary you hear much more from the actual witnesses devoid of campy re-enactments and speculation. What comes across is the sincerity of the witnesses and the fact they had encountered SOMETHING very unusual and not to the expected belief systems of today's society.In essence this movie captures that apprehension and excitement of the witnesses.Truly a must have for anyone interested in the topic!"
3,Don't believe all the hype,Felt like a reality show... with no clear visual of what is thought to be a bigfoot captured on film... dispite all the hi-tech equipement (as usual). As all reality shows some of it looks real and other parts look set-up...who knows...Over all worth the time but get it cheap...
2,Watchable,"I have to say i was somewhat interested to see this Tom Biscardi fellow and throughout this documentary he did not disappoint.I dont know if the people in this doc are for real or not, im a believer in sasquatch but i have to say most of this documentary is false, all these people finding large footprints, well footprints are so rare in themselves but not in Biscardis documentary. The alleged bigfoot leg is clearly a Bear, come on maaaaaan, its obviously a bear and all the footprints are fakes, probably courtesy of biscardis cronies.Dont be taken in by this man."
1,Very unconvincing,"After watching this I became less convinced that bigfoot might exist. There was no ""hard"" evidence gained and the researchers were looking for clues that supported their theory, which is the absolute wrong way to approach any investigation.The credibility of Mr. Biscardi is questionable in my mind when he referred to the known bigfoot hoaxer Ivan Marx as ""my partner"". He also showed several photos that were obviously hoaxed, including Marx's crippled ""Bigfoot"" and an absurd-looking rubber and hair costume supposedly chewing on a deer's leg.Also ridiculous was the alleged photo from Clarence, NY, which showed a person in an a bad gorilla suit beside a John Deere Gator.But the clincher for me was when Biscardi was ""wood-knocking"" on a tree at night and then when the echo came back said ""he just responded!"".Overall a very disappointing, uninspired and unconvincing effort."
1,nothing new here.,Ive spoken with Tom on the phone and we chatted about the topic. He spoke about a guy in eastern ID that had a BF hand I should've known it was to good to be true. Once I spoke to others in the know they informed me that hes a known hoaxer. That being said I cant say much good about any of his films and supposed evidence. Ive seen a few of Tom's films and each time I came away feeling like my time was wasted. I'm glad I didn't purchase any of them.Jeff Meldrum knows his stuff and hes a professor at ISU. Hes the one to follow on the subject. His book Sasquatch: Legend meets Science is where its at.Ive been actively researching the subject for 12 years or so as well as going on a BFRO outing in 08.
3,Interesting ?,"The cover is the best thing about this documentary. After reviewing information over the last few years, I find that the guy is not credible."
4,another one of my husbands childhood books,"I bought this because my husband has been trying to get books for my daughter to read. She is not a reader at all, and we are trying to find a genre that she will read. Well, this was one that my husband liked as a kid, so we got it for her to read. My husband read the book in a couple of hours, and handed it to her. She read about one page, and the book has not moved since. the story is good, the writing is very good...just not her cup of tea."
2,Great - until it dies...,"I've had this camera for 13 months, and I've been extremely happy with it for these 13 months. Very easy to use, with the ""scene modes""; AA batteries, so you never really have to worry about charging, because you can have a few batteries at hand; never had to read the manual; very good picture quality, upto 8x10 prints; pops into any computer with USB.But then, one day, after these 13 months, the camera errors out with E18. For all I can see, the camera is dead.Search the web for ""canon E18"", you'll see that it is a fairly frequent problem, and there's even a class action suit.13months for $300, that's not enough. My previous digical camera lasted 6 years. No more Canon compacts for me, I'm trying another brand..."
2,Works great - Until it dies...,"Good pictures, easy to use... until it just won't work anymore. After about 10 months of frequent use, the display would periodically get ""grainy"" and have lines and then finally the power on & off became very sporadic. When we researched the problem on-line, we found that it had been recalled due to a piece malfunction. We turned it in for repairs we were told that the problems weren't due to the recall and we'd need to pay over $100 to repair it. Since we'd had other family members who'd had the same exact problems, we decided to spend the $100 on a new Nikon instead."
5,Flawless performance so far,"I got the Canon A85 a few weeks back. I was clicking away within 10 min of opening the package. The camera is extremely user friendly, is very intuitive, and has the right dimension and weight for a solid comfortable feel.It also has enough advanced features to keep one curious about it."
3,DON'T DROP IT!!!,"I've owned this camera for about 1 1/2 years. It worked great until 2 days ago. It fell off the top of my desk top computer (I was uploading pictures) about 16"" off the carpet. After that it would not recognize the memory card. Tech said about $100 to fix.There's no way a little bump like that should break a camera."
4,I am very pleased with it,"I know some people have expressed dissatisfaction with the 'grainy' quality of the images. I guess it depends on what you are trying to do with it. I did some research, and this camera was recommended to me for what I like to do, which is take pictures of old buildings and sculpture. As it turned out, this camera was wonderful for that, because the pictures are very evocative. I took it on vacation and I liked the result of my nature pics, too. The photos have a 'softer' look that is a bit different from the usual 'hard' digital photo look, and it suits me. Of course if you are not looking for that, you might want to try something else. This might be a good camera for the more creative types.I gave it four stars because this was only my first digital camera and don't have much experience with the others, but it is my cherished friend now because of the lovely photos it's given me."
2,Do Not Purchase,This camera is a wonderful camera when it is working. Which after over the past 13 months of owning has only worked maybe 4 of those months. I finally packed it up and sent it back to canon. I still have not heard from them. I was told that it was errors in the hard drive from camera store techs. I feel that a name like Canon means Quality and Customer Service. This camera and company did not offer me either. I Do not reccommend this Digital Camera. It will break down.
3,Canon Powershot A85,I'm pleased with the many things this camera can do. It's a little complicated in the beginning but once you get the operations down its a great little camera - easy to carry; which is why I brought it. Pictures look good on the camera screen but I haven't down loaded them to my computer.
2,not as good as I thought,"I had a Canon S100 over 3 years and took thousands of photos. it was great. now its charger is broken, so I bought A85. the print color is somehow wrong. it is cold and whitened. the plastic body feels cheap. my S100 is better than A85 in print quality.now i switched to sony P100. it is very good. I want to stick with Cannon but A85 is really disappointing. The only good thing about A85 is that it uses cheap battery and memory card. But the prints are bad.my advise is that do not buy A85. buy Sony or Cannon's S series."
2,Not worth it,"I had a Kodak, which had failed to open shutters, so I bought Canon A85. I took over 240 pictures of which atleast 40 of them were blurry. I have never had so many blurred pictures. This camera eats battery like crazy. I had a battery tester, which showed the battery to be still in good condtion - but this camera indicates time to change the battery. The color is NOT as good as Kodak - especially when used with Flash. I returned my camera and am going back to Kodak."
1,not happy,"I purchased the Powershot A85 8 months ago and was very fond of my camera. It had all of the features I sought in a digital camera. The controls are very user friendly. It fits ergonomically in the hand. It captures sharp photos and made image taking a much better experience over any camera I owned before. HOWEVER, I recently got the ""memory card error"" message on my screen and lost all the pictures I took over the summer, including kids' baseball games, birthdays, and family vacation. I looked up the problem on the web and found many sites with customer complaints about this problem. Further, many of these customers referenced Canon's lack of help with the problem. I called Canon's tech support number and also got very poor service. What's the point of getting a digital camera if you lose your images and get no advice on how to solve the problem? I won't buy a Canon again."
2,Mystery??,"I borrowed this from the library. Boy, aren't I glad I didn't actually waste any $$$$.I am only giving it a 2 instead of 1 star because I really did enjoy the Christmas Day scene with the family. I felt like I was part of it.Other than that, I was really disappointed. The so-called mystery isn't really a mystery. The reveal of the murderer came out of no where. It felt like it was just thrown in together at the last minute.In addition, I really disliked Lucy. She gossips a lot, complains a lot and is somewhat a witch (aka another explisive word to replace witch). She accuses someone of murder just because she doesn't like him! Her reaction to her mother's depression is mind boggling. Instead of trying to understand and help, she whines about now having to worry about her. Her reaction to the murdered cat is also astonishing; there is no grief at all.I won't be reading the next books; Lucy Stone is not my cup of tea at all."
4,Light Read,"I read this book, the first in a series. It was a nice solid read. I will be reading more in the series."
3,OK,This was just OK. I'll read a couple more just to see if the series improves. I think I was expecting humor.
2,I Really Wanted to Like This Book!,"I really wanted to like Mistletoe Murder. The intriguing cover and backflap description along with the concept of various holiday-themed murder stories really caught my attention. I was excited to find another series to read.However, this first book was dull and bogged down in the daily life of the female protagonist. The first half of the book was extremely slow and once it actually started to pick up a little there was next to no mystery for the reader to figure out. Details were suddenly thrown at you. Little was left to the imagination.I was very disappointed with the book and am reconsidering reading the series as a result."
1,mistletoe Murder,Did not like book at all like the other person said someone get murder in the beginning and they found out who did it in the last 10 pages. Never ever figured out why they had to kill the cat off.Will not waste my time on the author again.Did not read just scaned it for that is all that is was worth. Wish I had saved my money.
1,"The ""mystery"" is, where is the mystery?","This isn't a mystery...this is a compendium of shopping notes, cookies, children's problems, antiques, etc....and, oh yes, someone gets murdered at the beginning of the book...and the killer is discovered at the end...with very little pertinent detecting in between. One good thing about misteltoe....I can kiss this ""author"" goodbye!"
2,Mistletoe Murder,"This is a quick read, but I doubt that I will ever pick up this author again. The cover is much more interesting than the story inside, which is as flat as a soda without its fizz. Don't waste your time with this one."
4,Mistietoe Murder,I think this book was very entertaining and well written. I have read many by Leslie Meier. I am looking forward to more books by this author.
1,A Most Boring Murder,"I was so happy to be able to borrow this ebook from my local library and was really looking forward to a good Christmas cozy murder. I guess the story takes place around Christmas, and there was a murder at the beginning of the book, and the murderer is revealed at the end, but between the beginning of the book and the end of the book there was absolutely nothing interesting enough to make me care about any of the characters. The culprit turned out to be so far fetched it was ridiculous. Another thing that was off putting to me was the use of the s*t word while talking about going to church on Sundays. I will not be attempting any more of this author's murders."
5,This Book Was Reissued as Another Title!,"The whole Lucy Stone series is good reading and this book starts the whole thing off, but you have a better chance of finding this under the reissued title, called ""Mistletoe Murder"". :)"
4,good cd,"I give this cd four stars because, as prior reviewers have stated, it does not equal the intensity of her live shows (especially when she is playing in a smaller venue). I would just like to make one comment, to sort of build on what other reviewers have said about the more ""edgy"" quality in her live shows--having first seen Theresa live in the summer of 2001 and having last seen her play earlier this month (and at least a couple of times in between), I definitely feel that her live performances have been getting edgier in the past couple of years--I do not really think the gap between album and live was as pronounced a couple of years ago when this album was was released."
2,I was disappointed.,I selected this purple barretes because it looked have color harmony and calmness. But I was disappointed its reality. Light blue stones break its balance and it looks a toy of kids.
2,Bombed for me,"After proving that she's as strong as any man, scrawny 128 lb., former firefighter Kristin Scott (Burns) gets hired as a smoke jumper. The acting is mediocre at best. The film is mildly entertaining. Scott is at odds with her sister, who holds Scott responsible for their father's death. As soon as the sister announced her plans for going on a camping trip in the woods, I knew exactly what was going to happen. You will too. The plot is predictable. So is the syrupy-sweet ending.If you're in the mood for a mild movie-of-the-week type flick that takes no thought or concentration, go for it. Otherwise don't bother. It's like eating soup when you really want meat and potatoes."
4,Extremely Valuable,"This book although by by a writer from the left is a well researched well-written survey of slavery. Without emotion it explains how slavery, something which had practically ceased to exist following the collapse of the Roman World was re-created to provide labour in colonies of the new world.It describes the setting up of the trade occurred and how it operated in practice. The brutality, the mechanics of how slaves were obtained how they were sold, what they did as slaves.The absence of passion makes the book an even more powerful indictment of the institution of slavery. It describes how in most of the colonies slaves were over time worked to death. In Brazil, the usual life expectancy was seven years.The book is challenging as it raises questions about the origin of our societies and seriously challenges the notions that European Society was either civilized or Christian."
1,NOT Deck Protectors,The title of the product is deliberately misleading. These are not the stronger quality Deck Protectors; they are much more flimsy.
2,better than nothing,"The Haynes manual makes for a better supplement than it does a roadmap for your next project.A little better organized/better pictures than Chiltons but still not worth the money imo.Save yourself a few bucks and find a pdf of the factory service manual for free online.I've looked through this manual a significant number of times and I don't feel that it has helped in any projects.Get a more indepth book on basic auto repair with color pictures and use the internet for more job specific projects, there are plenty of DIY tutorials out there.I don't use it for much more than torque specs.edit: awful instructions to remove lower control arms, Chiltons would have been the better choice for that project since it gave accurate instructions. I don't believe that any of these books are based on a complete tear-down and rebuild aside from the first model year it was originally intended for."
2,Weak photos,This book is particularly weak on the photos. Too many years are covered with not enough detail.
4,It's not XYZ repair for the Compleat Idiot...,"but then what is? That era and those cars are gone. This is a useful book if you combine it with lots of internet searching. Unlike that old VW repair book, this one probably won't help the naive avoid the most obvious traps and conundrums the first time through some procedure (e.g. where are the best jack/stand points? Search on line). But it does seem to give the essentials that a reasonably experienced mechanic needs. Good luck getting that experience."
1,I expected more,"Im not saying it was a waste of time but there are books that are worth paying for and this time, well, I start thinking what could I have done with the money I payed. Sorry."
4,Here's another good book for those live and breathe Brands,"For anyone involved in branding this book gives very practical advice. A common complaint about business books is that they are all OK in theory but contain little in the way of explanations of how to do it - this book however offers not only theory and some good case study. Overall very impressive and a must read for anyone involved in sales, advertising or marketing functions. As someone has already said these guys really know their stuff and it works!! Another book I highly recommended is 60-Minute Brand Strategist by Idris Mootee. This book is LOADED with solid, meaty real world branding insights and techniques that can are being kept as trade secrets. You will probably find this book a real eye opener. If you're looking for a more balanced marketing book, suggest going for David Aaker's books, some Kotler's books."
2,True but not that insightful,"You'd think that a book about emotional branding with a forward by Sergio Zyman would have something interesting to say. Unfortunately, this book make a number of good points but it's not all that interesting. Many of the points should be fairly intuitive and obvious for marketing people who have a clue. Some points made are interesting refreshers, like the importance and potential impact of invoking multiple senses in the consumption and purchase experience. Unfortunately many of the chapters are not newsworthy and can be summarized by their lame titles, such as ""Women: The New ""Shoppers in Chief"" and ""Gay and Lesbian Consumers: Sincerity is the Best Policy!""The book mostly gives examples of brands that have done X or Y really well without leaving the average reader or business person with any concept about how the point is relevant in a gernalizeable sense.Final gripe is that the book reads a little bit like an advertisement for the author's firm."
3,"Good ideas, practical information. A little tired","Gobe is definitely on the right track here, but he drags on a little too long for my liking. He's got some interesting ideas on how to treat the brand and give it a personality, but I don't really see all the hype that everyone talked about. This book is on just about every ""must read"" business book list, and I'm sure in 2002 it deserved to be there, but in 2004 it's more like a ""recommended reading."" You won't regret reading this, but you might get something more out of a newer book."
2,"OUTDATED - ""updated and revised edition"" full of old examples","I agree with the sentiments of many of the other reviewers, but to add to the conversation --- reading this book is like being in a time warp with tons of outdated examples...such zingers as ""the new millenium"", the success of Kmart via Martha Stewart, references to Compaq to name a very, very few.The book says it was updated in 2009, but they didn't do a sufficient job in my opinion.Despite the outdatedness and the fluff, it's a decent book. That said, in a world of finite time and resources, I'd recommend looking at other books on the topic."
3,"Good book, but 50% too long",This is a good book that explains the importance of creating an emotional connection with the consumer when designing a brand. It is however too long as the same (good) concept is repeated many times in different words.
1,Bad Dryer!,"Broke after only 2 months of gentle use. Even cheapy drugstore variety dryers last longer than this! Since Amazon won't exchange or replace even defective merchandise after 30 days post-purchase, you're left on your own to resolve the issue."
2,"Vampires bite, vixens don't apparently.","Sexy naked women doing eachother,An alluring quality of the lesbian vampire genre, is certainly not in short supply here. If that's all you wanted though, you would simply order porno in bulk......right? What this genre is all about is lesbian VAMPIRES. Vampire and prey culmunating in a lustful embrace of pain and passion called a ""bite"". Remember that? Remember when vampires did that?Vampire Vixens doesn't have any vampires in it. There's a chick in a cape and she can fly. Is she Wonder Woman or what?I couldn't tell you about the dialogue or the story, although I'm sure there was nothing erotic. One does not catch much of the story or dialogue while scanning in FF mode looking for the vampires.Why two stars? There are naked women who are at least trying to act like they're having sex. That really only gets 1 1/2 stars, but it wasn't an available option so I rounded up."
1,I FEEL TOTALLY CHEATED!!!,"I got this movie because they sold it togather with carlitos angels. a funny hispanic comedy about some ghetto girls that fight crime and smoke out. Who the heck thought this piece of junk was a good match with that movie, first of, nobody is spanish, and there is nothing funny about this. there arent even any real vampires in this movie. what are the people at amazon thinking putting these two movies together"
3,A little disappointing...,"Pros: It's very quiet, made of a nice material and easy to adjust the speed while you're using it. I's also small enough to not be uncomfortable.Cons: It's REALLY flexible. I had a hard time getting it to even hit where it was supposed to let alone get any pressure from it. I wouldn't advise it as a G-spot vibe but it's good otherwise."
4,The BIZ is coola than u & yo' mama!!!!!,"Biz Markie ""On The Turntable 2"" is an out o' print, hard-to-find (therefore, expensive), Japanese import that was put out in 2000. Accordingly, only diehard Biz fans need apply as it is a DJ album.The disc contains your host flowin' thru classic Soul/R'n'B cuts-DJ style. Biz's selection weaves together 22 jams, such as Booker T & The MG's ""Hip Hug Her,"" Isaac Hayes' ""Hung Up On My Baby"" (sampled by numerous rappers over the years), Staple Singers' ""I'll Take You There,"" Jean Knight's ""Mr. Big Stuff,"" and others. Biz puts his artistic stamp over these jams w/ some cool turntable work. This album celebrates those perfomers who came along before rap music, and it is an appreciation of their lasting influence.Check it out if you're a Biz fan!"
3,The Horror That Was Dada,"This book does give the reader a glimpse of the evil of the Idi Amin regime that terrorized Uganda from 1971 to 1979. It also gives us some insights as to how such an evil dictator could stay in power for so long while perpetrating so many dreadful crimes. It was a combination of other black African leaders studiously looking the other way and refusing to condemn him -- Julius Nyere of Tanzania being a major exception, considerable moral and material support from wealthy Islamic regimes such as Libya under Gadaffi, and, of course, sheer terror against all who dared to speak against him. My biggest problem with the book was its turgid style of writing: I found it necessary to re-read many a paragraph before I got the gist of what it was all about."
2,"not much, but better than nothing","Given the fascinating, albeit monstrous, subject he had to work with, George Ivan Smith came up short. The book is written with less personality than Al Gore! Smith's writing is so dry that it is a struggle to wade through the slower parts(and there are many of them). Amin is infamous for his insanity, his humor, and for his brutality...Smith seems to want to focus more on his politics. Idi's politics weren't very interesting, hence the dullness of the book. Don't get me wrong, some of the madness is captured here. The trouble is that Smith can't keep his obvious bias and lack of comprehension out of the book. Idi Amin was a terrible human being, make no mistake about it, but Time magazine gave me more to hold my interest in one 1977 article than Mr. Smith manages in this 198-page yawn. Look elsewhere if you want to see the train wreck that was Idi Amin!"
1,Noisy and just overall badly built!,"I got this unit for Christmas hoping I would get a nice 3 CD changer with a record player built in...what I got was the noisiest piece of junk ever built. The CD, yes THE CD PLAYER, is the noisiest function on this entire unit. It hisses so bad I can't even hear music! And that's not the only problem. The other reason I got this unit, ironically enough, is the record player(turntable). Again, very noisy but that's expected of records, but the stylus is pure garbage. It's inncaurate, flimsy and probably made of cheap plastic that will destroy your records! If you need a 3 CD changer with a record player STAY AWAY FROM THIS THING!"
4,I LOVE MY NEW STEREO!,"First of all, there is nothing wrong with the volume button on this stereo, as another reviewer claimed. You just turn the dial left or right repeatedly, and the dial makes a clicking noise as the volume goes up or down. I agree with the reviewer who says this unit does it all at a reasonable price. Yes, there are some obvious missing features--such as the needle bar not having an automatic return. But overall, I'm very happy with this unit. The sound is good, I love the separate speaker system, and I'm having a so much fun playing all my old records! If you're on a budget, don't go out and buy all your old favorites on CD. Get this unit and take advantage of your record collection! I've even added to my record collection by shopping thrift stores and music exchange stores--albums are as cheap as a dollar each! I highly recommend this stereo unit!"
1,Broke out of the box!,"I bought this to transfer my LP'S to to MP3's and when I unpacked the unit, one of the hinges to the cover was broke! Now, a year or so later the remote control gives out! I don't have a problem with the hiss on CD playback, but this is a CHEAP piece of equipment, although I paid over $200 for it!! What a sucker me and other were for purchasing this Mattel quality stereo!"
5,Happy birthday Mylene,"This collaboration between Mylene Farmer, Laurent Boutonnat and Francois Hanss results in a breathtaking A/V experience. This is a ten years old concert that is as up to date as anything available today. Mylene is as professional as ever while sharing an unequalled intimacy with her fans.This DVD is highly recommended."
5,Great visuals and music,vendor was really great about sending this item on time and product is of high quality. Music and the show are just fenomenal.
3,"Good, but not great...","I've been a big fan of Mylene Farmer for about seven years and bought this DVD with fairly high expectations. The show begins quite spectacularly, but quickly mellows into a frankly uninteresting and musically devoid production. The music behind the vocals is subdued to the extent that it is difficult to hear, and Mylene is a bit stiff on stage, even when correographed dance routines are involved. For my money, I prefer any Alizee production to this (she is better live in my opinion than recorded, which is saying a lot). I still love Mylene's music, hence the generous three-star rating, but this could be better."
2,GAME DOES NOT LOAD......IF YOU HAVE A NEWER PC!!!!!!,"WARNING!!!! the game does not load with newer pcs which should have been noted in the description. I have Windows 7, 8gb of ram, and so on. Usually with older games you can just change the compatibility mode and it will run but I have tried but it won't load. it just gives a error message stating that the wrong disc is inserted.......no help anywhere. Overall, this was a bad purchase. I looked it up and others were having the same problem. If I find a solution will let u know. Just a warning for others with higher end pcs."
4,Great but not complete,"As much as I love the fact that they put this on PC, I find it incomplete just like the XBox and other systems this appears on. I hate that you have to unlock Sonic TH 2 with Knuckles and Sonic TH 3 with Knuckles. I think it is missing several sonic Game Gear titles.I Felt these Game Gear Titles were missing :1. Sonic Spinball2. Soinc TH 23. Sonic Drift 2I felt these titles that are found on ""Sonic Gems"" for GameCube should have been included :1. Sonic CD2. Sonic The Fighters3. Sonic RI felt that if these were added, it would make a better collection. If those games were added, it would be a Complete back in the day Sonic Collection. Even though I find it dissappointing because 6 essentail Sonic Games are missing, It is still worth owning. Like I always say, some is better than none."
2,This product needs improvement,"I loved the game Sonic and was excited when I saw this product offered. After receiving it though, I've had nothing but problems. When I finally get it to load on my machine and play, nothing else will run (graphic editing programs). When I get those to run, this will not load or run. There's spyware involved I think. Caution to anyone thinking they can buy this and play as they did on a game console."
1,Doesn't Work,"I bought it even though other people said that it would not work on their PC. After many attempt with installing, uninstalling, turning off the firewall, etc, it does not work on my PC. What a bummer!"
3,Hypocritical?,"This is an amazing translation and the ""author's"" wife has done a wonderful job of placing the original text into English. So much so that I would have expected to see her name listed as author.I had great difficulty in believing the listed ""author"" actually subscribed to the beliefs held within the text as even his dedication seemed to hold much hypocracy.However, in of itself seperate from the author, a fabulous book."
3,Still useful,"With the WWW changing daily, research is hard pressed to keep up, but the methods used by these folks are pretty solid -- good starting point for anyone doing net research. The essays in the book concentrate on Usenet/newsgroups in particular."
3,"Interesting in Concept, Flawed in Execution","As interesting as a mystery set in Madrid at the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War may be, the stage setting can't save a book without an ending.The protagonist (Carlos) is a fine character. However, he is joined by a pantheon of clichéd men and women. Carlos's development also suffers (possibly from a lack of another 75 pages). How quickly would you expect a civil war hardened member of the Gardia Civil who executes a Communist women with his pistol on pg. 16, start sleeping with ""Reds"" and inviting them into his home?So, this novel is a good start for the author. The period (at least in English) is underdeveloped. However, the author has to learn how to successfully wrap-up in 30 pages, or at least don't dig the hole so deep."
3,Hard to follow,I enjoyed reading about the time period of the Spanish civil war. I had trouble keeping the characters clear in my mind. The book was not one that I had any problem putting down .... not a page turner.
2,Silly,"The Spanish Civil War has always been an interest of mine, and I looked forward to reading this novel. But I found it a major disappointment, with a disjointed narrative and poorly-drawn characters whose motives are inexplicable. Sergeant Tejada is one of the silliest characters ever put on paper. One moment he's a hard-core Guardia Civile who shoots an unarmed woman in the head, no questions asked, the next he's in love with a Communist teacher and protective of her student. Implausible, incomprehensible, and unsatisfying."
2,simply poorly written,"This book lacks the fundamentals of a good novel: fully developed characters, believable dialogue, plot. Pawel has a clever idea for a book, but lacks the writing talent to do much with it. There are much better writers out there in the historical fiction genre, such as Martin Cruz Smith or John Lawton."
4,Intriguing,"Pawel paints a vivid picture of 1940 Madrid, just after the Spanish Civil War. She gets inside all her characters, republicans and her Fascist main character, who is basically a good man, although he thinks nothing of beating up suspects. I know. Sounds strange, but Pawel is truly able to place herself in the time and understand what made those Spaniards do what they did."
1,?,did not receive the right cd in the case. kind of disappointed but have listened to the one I received
3,painful to read but educational,"This book consists of sixteen sermons sandwiched between hundreds of pages of introductory material describing the history of Jewish sermonizing. The sermons tend to be almost unreadable: highly erudite but often too long, too unfocused, and too obsessed with sin and punishment. Some suggest that ritual infractions that might seem minor to most readers today (such as inappropriate beard-shaving) will be punished with unnatural deaths or anti-Semitic violence as a Divine corrective.After reading these grim sermons, I can understand why Hasidism's emphasis on serving God with joy was both popular and necessary."
5,Wonderful,"As a vocalist with a love for male a cappella, Cantus has struck my fancy in numerous ways. This album is a WONDERFUL example of their artistry. Their rendition of Randall Thompson's Alleluia is stunning, as are all of the other tracks. Truly worth the purchase."
3,"Cantus, Against the Dying of the Light","Fell in love with this men's vocal group when I heard songs from their CD ""That Eternal Day."" The vocals on Against the Dying of the Light are nothing short of amazing - no complaint there - but, however spiritual, most of the choices just don't move me the same way. They are wonderful with Sibelius but their Alleluia (Thompson) was perfect pitch with no true emotion."
4,review of nge eva type 04 figure,it was a good item good for kids or fansi like the figure very muchbut it smells of industrial solvents
4,The Good and the bad things about this Revoltech figure,"The Neon Genesis Evangelion: Eva Unit 04 w/ Revoltech Joint has:Good Points:-Very posable-Very durable-Good amount of interchanged parts-good look-Never seen before on the TV series or MoviesBad Points:-The silver Paint is too easy to remove on some parts (Arms, abdomen, waist-line)-The revoltech Knee Joints is too big, if you compare with other Knees of new models has a better design.-Same design and parts of the The Neon Genesis Evangelion: Eva Unit 03 old version with the change of colors of course. Actually we can say it's the twin brother of the Unit 03."
5,An excellent 70's romance album !!!,"This album was recorded in 1977, beginning his era with BMG records. The executives, happy to have a performer like JOSE JOSE, provided him with the best musicians, numbers and producers of the time. Included in this album are 2 numbers by Mexico's greatest: Juan Gabriel (""Ya lo pasado, pasado"" & ""Ahora No !""). Among others credited are Napoleon (""Lo que no fue, no sera""), Adan Torres(""Almohada"") and Billy Joel (the spanish version of ""I love you just the way you are""). Of the 10 numbers included, 7 were top ten hits in Mexico, Colombia and the U.S. Leaving disco to other performers that needed to launch their productions to the international market, Jose Jose's album is just pure old-fashioned love songs, songs still heared today. This is definitely a must-have album!!!!"
4,HUDSON YOUNG WHAT IF,"HOW DOES A MUSICIAN LIKE THIS GET MISSED? FOUND THIS CD IN A NON-IDENTIFIED GROUP OF MISC.ITEMS FROM A MUSIC DISTRIBUTOR WHO WENT BANKRAUPT.IF YOUR INTO SOULFUL,WELL-WRITTEN SONGS,WITH A TINT OF FUNKY,FIND THIS AND BUY IT.IF I HAVE TO MAKE A COMPARISON,I'D SAY JOHN MAYER MEETS BOBBY WOMACK.BEST TRACKS ARE SAVE ME & DAYS GONE BY,A PERSONAL FAVORITE.CLEAN PRODUCTION,TASTY STUDIO PERFORMANCES FROM ALL THE PLAYERS,WHO REALLY GET THE MESSAGE & INTERPRET YOUNG'S VISIONS OF MELODY & RHYTHM VERY NICELY.THIS CD WILL ALWAYS BE ONE OF MY RARE,GLAD I LISTENED TO,& FELT THIS GUYS WORK.HE CERTAINLY DESERVES RECOGNITION ON A NATIONAL SCALE."
5,Nature,"Nature. Extremes. Life and death. Birth. Typical nature DVD. Got it cause Yosemite is so near and dear to my heart. If granite and old forest growth is you thing, then by all means get it."
1,Defective Disc,"Disc played a couple of times, and then my player would no longer recognize it. I have a couple of hundred DVDs and they all play on this brand new Sony Blu ray player. I have contacted the seller, allenturner3, and have received no response. Beware of this product.Addendum: Seller, allenturner3, refunded my money when I returned DVD,"
3,Great Photography - Painful Narration,"This DVD is nicely filmed and the picture quality is great. It's wonderful if you just want to look at Yosemite Park, but aren't interested in actually learning much about it. The narration on this DVD provides almost no value. It consists mainly of a man reciting bad poetry to describe what Yosemite is like. Am I missing something? I expect narration in a nature video to provide useful information about what's being displayed, not bad poetry. I have a number of other park touring DVD's with far superior narration even though they're low budget productions. My wife and I barely managed to get through this DVD once with the narration on. Fortunately it allows you the option to view without narration, which is what we'll do in future. I gave this DVD 3 stars because of the quality photography, the narration would get 1 star at best."
4,"Pretty Good, But Not As Good As the BBS EARTH DVDs","I've invested in a few blu-ray DVDs and have found the BBC EARTH ones to be the most beautiful and expertly produced -- Such as the Planet Earth series, and my very favorite of all time; Yellowstone, Battle For Life. This is well-done and pretty well done, but it's hard to be as perfect as the BBC blu-ray nature DVDs. I like it. Just wish it were a little more professionally written and produced. It was almost worth the money. Yellowstone was worth twice what I paid for it -- it's is the pinnacle of photographic genius and blu-ray production. Yosemite was a little disappointing but it's OK."
5,Husband loves it.,I originally purchased this cleanser for myself. My husband tried it and was very impressed. He said that his face really feels clean after he uses it. Smells great too. He has also started using the pomegranate moisturizer.
5,The History of the Lehigh Valley Railroad by Robert F. Archer,"Mr. Archer has done a superb job at relating the 130 year history of the Lehigh Valley Railroad in a highly readable fashion. The book is neither superficial nor is it rendered boring by being overly detailed. It is also filled with pictures, many of which I have never seen before. The final few decades of the railroad's existence were not covered as thoroughly as other periods, but then that may be because there wasn't much of a story to tell during those dying years. After reading this book, it is clear to me why it is considered by many railroad history fans to be THE definitive book on the Lehigh Valley."
3,"A good transcription, contains some big errors.","Incredibly, ""Voice of the Voiceless"" is very accurately transcribed. ""Ashes in the Fall"", and, ""War Within a Breath"" are very inaccurate, see Morello's column in Guitar World August and October 2000 for the real way to play them. ""Born As Ghosts"" is missing something, but exactly what I do not know. ""Born of a Broken Man"" is not in DADGAD but simply in ""dropped-D"", look at the, ""Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium"" DVD for the real figure positions. The rest of the songs are fairly accurate"
4,Basic microwave cooking,"A good selection of recipes and tips for basic microwave cookery. The perfect book for someone whose ONLY cooking appliance is a microwave. Also good for new microwave owners who want to try a variety of recipes.While the cooking times given are specifically directed at 440 to 550 ""low-wattage"" microwaves, these recipes would actually work with any microwave. You'd simply have to use your own best judgement to shorten the cooking time."
3,"Good for the basics, but...","These books hit on the basics, not much of the advanced material that is tested on the exams.I wrote a similar review for the Sybex core-4. Both Sybex and Syngress seem to do very well to teach the basics, and just enough material to get you a passing score.However, if you want a well rounded study experience, you need to supplement these books with a series like the CRAM pack, from another publisher.Both Sybex and Syngress do a good job for the basics. I bought both core-4 packs. It forced me to read double of everything. But even having done that, you need to supplement this core-4 pack.An alright first step, but it needs depth."
5,perfect,"went great on my F250 superduty. Glad I went with this, much better than Fords version of Ranchos. Glad I got these instead of the 9000's. Who wants to adjust their shocks all the time, fine for what I tow and do with my truck."
3,The one I received looks really cheep,"The one I received looks really cheep compared to the one seen in the picture. The measurements given here do not match the item I received. what I received looks exactly like ""VillaWare Pasta/Pastry Cutter 6.5-in."" It is actually 1.5 inches (wheel diameter) by 6.875 inches (total length) by .75 inches (widest part of handle). I tried to call Amazon but couldnt get through. The one they sent me looks like it will work, so for 5 bucks I spent, it is not worth the hassle of trying to get this straightened out."
2,The Indian Wars,"This book was a disappointment; it did not provide me the information that I expected when ordering it. If I had been interested in a pictorial review, I might have been more satisfied with it."
5,Best Reconstrutor !!!!,I have used this product for many years. I have people always giving me compliments on my hair that it looks shiny and beautiful!!! I have long hair!It also keeps my hair from tangling.
3,Great Music - The CD's Just Too Short,"The wonderful remastering makes for great clarity, and CC's playing has influenced guitarists worldwide for generations. But as a sampler from the new Columbia box set, this CD is simply too short -- less than 25 minutes long. Why not put out a ""best of"" selection filling an entire CD? If you're looking for a one-disk volume of CC, you may not find better sound than this, but you can certainly find a more generous helping of his musical genius."
3,Excellent As Long as it Works,"We love the pizza we make with this product. The only drawback is they seem to go out fairly quickly. We are on our 4th unit in 2 years and have taken to buying a backup knowing it could die at any time. Every time it stops working suddenly as if a fuse has blown, but we can't find any way to repair it. Because it works so well we will probably keep buying replacements. If anyone know how to repair it we would be so grateful..."
2,Too much to wade through,This book presents too much material in an unorganized fashion. The sections concentrate on so much extra stuff that the math is difficult to follow. It is unclear what is important and what is not with all the vocabulary and activities and practice problems. I haven't seen later editions but it definitely needs to be cleaned up. It does have lots of real world examples and activities but this is algebra 1 and kids need to learn the basics first. One has to pick and choose what to do with it and that's not what I want.
1,Crap,My school buys this book obviously because it's cheap or something. Nobody gets this. The writers are too busy trying to sound intelligent and make themselves look good that they leave everyone behind. It's just crap. They act like your suppose to understand it already and the reason we have the book is to learn.
5,These chicks Rock!,"If you like the Pat Benatar style of grrrrrl rock, you must have this cd. They will show Pat a thing or two! They not only belt out strong vocals, but play the guitars, bass and drums with equal intensity like no girl band has ever done. The most moving track is 'Dust To Diamonds', which is not only a masterpiece of showmanship, but a good message as well, aptly describing God's loving touch in a life surrendered to Him.The production is top-notch on this lp, done by Billy Smiley, who was also producer for Whiteheart."
5,Reason I got into Graphic Novels,"If it wasn't for this story, I'd probably still be ingorant of the world graphic novels. I had grown up reading comics, your typical Batman, X-men, etc fan, but never realized the world beyond muscle bound super heros. This is a great and amazing story. The characters pull you into their world and when you're done you wish there'd be more. I love this book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good read"
2,"S'okay, sort of","Depends on what you like, I like many Indy-films and took a chance. Did not like it but not that it was badly or shabbily done, it was not - just turned out not to entertain me in any regards (and I like some weird stuff) -- best I can liken it to is silent expressionist style that meant quite a ""point"" to the writer, but did not translate well, to a person who was not invloved in its production. So not a crappy film in any way - just won't watch it ever again - had no ""re-play"" value for me."
1,I paid to watch this?,"I can't believe I spent hard-earned money on this joke of a zombie movie. It is terrible...and that is being nice. Everything about it is terrible...no acting...no cinematography...nothing scary...nothing, nothing, nothing. Avoid this at all costs. Trust me, you'd be better off cleaning the litter box or picking up the dog poop in the back yard."
1,limited scope,"Well this is one of the more disappointing books I've bought. I expected ideas (what to use for insulation), tested implementations (fitting a door, sewing the roof covers), and design specifics (what size roof ring, how many rafters). I found more of that info on the web in 5 minutes than in this book. IF you want to build a 13' yurt out of bamboo or johnson grass with cut up inner tubes and other scrounged materials this is the book for you. If that's not what you want to build, get a different book."
3,Get back in your tent hippie!,Actually it is a very good and comprehensive book. It covers not only construction but traditional construction and customs. There is also a guide to the evolution of the yurt as well as different styles of yurts. This is a book for the nomad.
1,Any similiraty with The Divine Comedy is pure coincidence,"This is the first Divine Comedy album, even prior to ""Liberation"". It's a bad album, with nothing similar to the Divine Comedy sound. The only thing recognizable is Neil Hannon's voice. If you're obsessed about The Divine Comedy and want to complete your collection, go ahead. If not, forget it!"
4,quantum mechanics Schaum 's,"This book is excellent but needs to be updated with a chapter on newer concepts and stuff on :entanglement , Copenhagen interpretation ,local and non local,,hidden variables,Bell's theorem etcrobert alfano ,ccny"
1,Down on My Knees...Deflated,"I have a strong interest in meditative poetry and assumed that this book would provide some profound commentary to enlighten me further in my readings and re-readings. No such luck. I found the author to be arbitrary in her selections, one-dimensional in her interpretations, and--what makes both of those qualities even worse--she has the kind of nagging insistence of a know-it-all schoolmarm. Her directive tone is so domineering that she almost has to be insincere at the core. One does hope to open up to another reader's suggestions about a text, but this author has the effect of making me want to slam my doors and shutter my windows. (Perhaps her relentless misreading of Blake encouraged me to invoke those images. Actually, I just closed the book!) I suppose I more than most don't like being preached at, but even so, most readers would agree, I think, that Rosenthal's sermonizing is a ministry to avoid."
3,Bird Watching,"If you are interested in a personal account of the author's bird watching, banding, and discussions of ecology, this is a fine book. If you are interested in the hows and whys of bird migration, however, you could do just as well by glancing in an encyclopedia. The mystery of migration gets short shrift and most of what remains are the author's ramblings about his own experiences. Nice title though."
1,"THIS IS NOT ""CARPENTRY"" - IT IS A WORKBOOK","This book is not the paperback version of the hardcover ""Carpentry"". It is the Workbook to accompany carpentry 4th edition.Don't be fooled like me."
4,Real Hip Hop,"If you want a real hip hop album without someone talking about their rims, their guns, their hoes, and the amount of money they have then pick this album up. This album is a witty, deep, conscious album. I agree with his sentiments especially on the banger cut ""Y'all should all get lynched"". We have far too many rappers out their selling out their souls and this art form we call hip hop for money. This man seems to have integrity and a natural love for the music and his people."
3,Slow off the Mark,"This book is slow off the mark and never builds much interest. It's overloaded with ill-defined characters you don't care about. I had to make a list to follow who was who. Only the slight advancement of the romance between Daisy and Alec was of interest. This was a disappointment in an otherwise enjoyable series. Unless you're reading the entire Daisy Dalrymple series, skip this boring installment."
4,Daisy and Alec together again,A good mystery with the mix of a budding romance draws you in. You can't help but root for Daisy and Alec as they solve crimes together.
3,Other books in this series are better,"I didn't like this book that well. There were a lot of characters and I had trouble keeping them straight. It seemed like everybody was having an affair in this book and I believe that occurs in a lot of the other books in this series. My favorite Carola Dunn book is Rattle His Bones, which concerns a natural history musuem."
1,Disatisfied,I was very disappointed in the product. The packaging was crushed and the action figures exposed. This was to be a gift and I ended up removing the action figures from the original packaging and re-wrapping. I'll think twice before ordering again.
2,The Children of Noisy Village,"The Children of Noisy Village(1986/88min) is an old time story with the setting just right before WWII. A group of boys and girls from about 5-10yrs old wander around the countryside and find fun and adventure from various childhood activities.The movie is in a story-telling mode with a voice of a little girl(who's supposed to be one of the girls in the story) narrating all throughout the movie. This movie is wholesome and safe for the young ones but the story is very slow moving.Also the accents of the actors might be a bit difficult to understand, especially for young kids. There is a pure quality to this movie but I'm not sure how much interest it would hold for the modern audience(kids or adults)."
5,Bible for import car fans,"If you love cars this is for you. If you love Japanese import cars, this video is for you. If you love customizing your machine, this video is for you. If you love racing, this video is for you.Finally the long awaited English version of the best selling Japanese video is now out. There is also a small online community at http://bestmotoringvideo.com."
4,Better than the included pads,"These work well. They pick up a lot of dust. The main complaint is they are a bit short and don't cover the StarMop completely. The plastic sticks out past the actual pad. Overall, these work for the price."
3,does require constant attention and patience,"This material presents the nervous system as it claims, but through some lengthy narrations and it jumps from one interview to another. In my opinion, a good documentary must succeed first to captivate the viewer attention by instigating the audience and viewers curiosity then keeping it awake. It may by just a matter of preference though. Otherwise, it touches the main and specific aspects it claims it approaches. I give it 3 of 5 stars."
4,Speaks to the basics very well.....,"I teach an A&P course to adults and this DVD presents the basics in a very concise manner. The language is easy to understand. If you are teaching a nervous system overview, this is the DVD for you. If you are, however, teaching much more in depth, you will need to discover another DVD. I am personally fond of the National Geographic presentations! As mentioned in a previous review, ""Just The Facts"" is exactly what it says it is - just the facts - and it does it very well. (:"
5,UFC season $,This season was awsome. You didn't get to see much of GSP but it allows you to really get to know some other fighters.
4,Love it,"I use this shampoo every other wash, and it keeps my hair a gorgeous platinum color. It smells great and leaves my hair very clean and soft. My only complaint is, Nexxus bottles have a tendency to have defective pumps. Not really a big deal, I swapped it out for an old one."
1,Item not as pictured,"This review is for ""Aztec Replacement Bike Disc Brake Pads (For Shimano Deore Hydraulic Brakes)"" The Brake pads that I received have the pin-tab on the side, not in the middle as shown in the picture. These will not fit Shimano Deore Hydraulic Brakes as advertised, not sure what they would really fit...Would appreciate the vendor updating the picture / description for accuracy"
5,A powerful testiment,"The combination of text, transcripts of 911 calls, the names of the deceased, and the powerful visual images makes this the most moving testament to 9/11 that I have spent time with. The text is especially strong and reflective. The transcript of the 911 calls is more powerful than any visual image I saw during the morning and afternoon of September eleventh.Thank you for publishing such a lovely and even-tempered book. It is a book to which I often return."
3,Kudos to Chomsky,"Noam Chomsky basically rescued this book. Without his article, the book wouldn't have been of much use."
1,Chomsky Includes Article Blaming U.S. for Attack,"Not satisfied to let the images speak for themselves, noted anti-American Noam Chomsky includes an article blaming the U.S. for the 9/11 attacks.I was enraged to see that such a sad individual would capitalize on an American tragedy, to further his anti-American political agenda.Do not support the publisher of this book.I cannot explain how angry I was to see Chomsky's article quietly inserted among these horrifying images. Its existence invalidates the entire book."
4,"If you're looking for a quiet dryer, this is not it!",I've had this dryer since July and use it daily. It's no better or worse than any other dryer I've used in its price range. Previously bought one for $89 (CHI) because it was quiet; it quit working after 13 months -- 1 month past the warranty period. Keep in mind: This dryer is NOT quiet.
3,Not Bad,"Pros: Compact, lightweight, easy to control heat and air speed settingsCons: Not a quiet hairdryer, and most especially not quiet for a dryer labeled as quiet. Lower-pitch sound than most, but still irritating for something used next to one's ears.Pricey for what it is.Haven't had it long enough to comment on whether it lasts longer than the usual hairdryer, but it has only a year warranty."
4,Wish it had one higher setting,"Works well, no problems yet. But when it's on the highest setting it still feels like there should be some more power coming out of it."
1,died in less than 6 months,"loved it at first, but then heating element decided to start going out. Hot then Cold and a pain when trying to dry hair"
2,Not quiet,"I was disappointed with this hair dryer. I needed a quiet hair dryer so I wouldn't wake my family when I get ready early in the morning. While advertised as being quiet, it is no different than the regular hair dryers we have. Very disappointing."
4,Not super quiet,"I've had hair dryers that were quieter. On a low setting this isn't too bad, and the pitch is lower than the annoying high pitched whine of many dryers. If quiet is your top priority, I'd keep looking."
2,The *cheap electronic keyboard* tribute to coldplay,"Quite well played, but the sound is tinny and nasty.It sounds to me like it is played on a cheap electronic keyboard so the sound is not rich and deep like real piano sounds, but actually unpleasant.Pity. Could the person playing it not have hired a real piano for the day??????"
3,Meh,"Ok, so i havent bought this albumn which doesnt give me a whole lot to work with, but just form the clips i can tel somthing is off. For the most part it sounds good, but i dont like the piano they used, the notes for the melody sound kind wierd, almost fake. Did they usea keyboard instead ofa piano??"
5,Excellent Resource,"This was a great video. I ordered it a couple of months ago and it breaks down rod building in a step by step basis. The only types of rods you WONT be able to make from watching this video is fly rods. I think this is a great place to start though if you're wanting to get into building fishing rods. I actually emailed the man in the video ""Doc Ski"" and he replied back with some very helpful tips. Great video...five stars."
3,libro de acondicionamiento,"esto es un libro para acondicionarse para la práctica del capoeira, encontraras movimientos básicos, algo de historia, es un libro para principiantes y para personas que esten interesadas en este excelente deporte."
2,Help the author pay his rent,"I had a gift certificate and used it to buy this book. I'm always looking for something new involving Capoeira - safe to say I am a collector. As for the book, if you are a student of Capoeira this is a cool book to look at in the bookstore and leave in the bookstore. If you are a student of Capoeiera this book is a ""been there, done that"" there is nothing new, you may be a little upset that you did not come up with this idea to help pay your rent, house mortgage, car payment, etc...Let's hope that his other book ""Luanda to Angola""(the title is something like that) has fresh ideas or new information about Capoeira that has not already been published"
3,"Usefull, If you're not in a Capoeira class.","If you've attended a well orchestrated Capoeira class for a couple of months, then there should be nothing useful to you in this book. It shows you how to use a few capoeira moves, with several variations, to achieve your fitness goals. You can probably already figure out how to do that yourself. You're better off buy ""The Little Capoeira Book"" by Nestor Capoeira.If you haven't attended a Capoeira class, but admire the art and are looking for a way condition your body, then this book is helpful. The author spends a good portion of the book defining ""fitness"" and defending his possition that Capoeira is possibly the best tool for well-rounded fitness. The rest of the book outlines some possible routines and gives detailed descriptions of moves, with pictures.Never once does the author of this book imply his writtings as a replacement to attending a class."
3,OK beginners book,"Capoeira conditioning in a basic stretching and capoeira exercise book.If you don't have experience in martial arts or any time of organized exercise classes, this book may be appropriate for you. As more of a beginners' book I would recommend this book. However, if you are more advanced you want to look further into your search."
5,100% Correct!,The title says it all. A very good book for anyone who is into physical conditioning using only body weight exercises!
3,Not Bad ...,"Quite a few ideas for lunches in this cookbook are just variations on typical lunches. But it's nice that they offer them at least. I don't refer to this book much and in my next trip to the used book store, it may go with me to sell. But if you are a person who can't think of what to take to the office for lunch, this might not be a bad idea. I'm trying to eat healthier and there's no nutritional information for the receipes, but I'll forgive the author that as this was out before most non-diet cookbooks started putting in the nutritional information. It's a thinner book, no pictures of the food (which is fine with me) and the receipes seem simple enough. I guess overall, I don't have strong feelings about if this is a good or bad cookbook - really it's just ok."
1,Cheap,"This is a challenging puzzle but made extremely cheap. Be careful picking the pieces up as the picture easily seperates from the cardboard. Pieces came in bent and not many different shapes. My husband and I have been building puzzles for years and have never lost a piece. After building this puzzle it was missing a piece, we build puzzles in the living room which is literally not used for anything else. Their is no chance we lost the piece that was missing which was a huge disappointment."
5,Not for the faint of heart,"I really enjoyed this puzzle, but it was not easy. The edges have a blue border all the way around which makes edge pieces easy to identify but harder to put together. The puzzle was so difficult that my wife and a friend of ours decided to let me do most of it. :)"
4,good basic info on fiberglass and gelcoat,"I bought this some time ago , good basic info, but there is so much more you will need to know.Do not rely on just this video for all the info, do your research know what your getting into before you tackle gelcoat and fiberglass repair on a boat, take your time, don't rush it and don't cheap skate on the quality of materials, your life may depend on it !and a FYI check the date of gel coat and polyester resin they have a max shelf life sealed of 1 yr! better yet use epoxy resin, more expensive but can be done in much colder temps, and is 100% water proof and will way out last polyester resin."
3,"cute, but not durable","We bought this two years ago for our shark obbsessed daughter. The ball is cute, but after one year of use the ball was not holding up as it should have. It will nolonger hold the air pressure. The seams look weakened."
2,Doesn't Look Like a Shark,"Bought this for my daughter, who likes sharks and plays soccer on a team named ""Sharks."" Wasn't so sure from the photo that it really looked like a shark, and I was right. All white ball with large toothy grin - but more of a goofy video game creature than a shark. The eyes have eyelashes! Don't know what shark this ball was modeled after, but it's not like any I've ever seen. It will do, though, as my daughter likes it and it's easy to tell which ball is hers."
4,Neutral,My comment/review may not be very useful because I didn't use this book.It seems like a good book but I cant say much about since I got it for my sister.
5,Science!!!! Yes!!!!,I am going to be teaching Science this summer and I thought this was a great book for children. I plan to use it on my lessons and it is going to make it more enjoyable for the children.This is a great book to have if you have children at home.
1,This is awful,"My god this is soo awful, how can the above reviewer compare this shiet to dnb, it's like you put a two year old having a tantrum in front of a synthisizer. Pure Shiet IMO =) Each to their own!"
4,Great lasting scent,Has a good smell and has a lasting scent that is very close to Eternity. I like it very well for use as a Deodorant and body spray.
5,For Organization ....,This case is good for bringing your tinctures with you.The cases can be stacked high for horizontal storage.Nice for organization.
1,Poor fit for Tohshiba e750/755,"Belkin lists the Toshiba e750/755 as PDA's that these overlays will fit. It is a very poor fit for this model. It's about 3/16"" too narrow and too short.Tha actual dimensions of the overlays should be published in the ads and on the packaging."
5,luminous!!,"Clamp's art is incredible, with flowing details and beautifully drawn characters...they're the mangaka that keeps on giving! This one is especially yummy to those who enjoy seeing Kamui-tachi in bloody situations. I would recommend it to anyone, just for the art, but the poignant sadness of the story is another factor that keeps me turning the pages, to the ultimate destiny that will one day inevitably befall Earth."
5,The Entire Personal Power II Set is Great!,"If you spend much time at all in your car, you should check out some of the Personal Power II CD's. I have bit by bit collected pretty much the entire Personal Power II system. This is not only very motivating material, but very practical and useful. Plus its just plain fun to listen to Tony, he's just so dang....EXCITED! Plus you could be planning your conquest of the world during your commute and I can think of many less productive things to do! (He's right up there with Rush Limbaugh on my list of ""enjoyable personalities to listen to in your car while driving)"
1,This Is A Ripoff,"Frank Zappa is NOT a ""Primary Contributor"". He appears briefly on three occasions during this 52-minute snoozer about cocaine abuse in the 1970's.About this non-movie, I think Frank said it best; ""I think its completely absurd."""
2,It's Not About The Song,"I own versions of the song Cocaine Blues by Bob Dylan, Keith Richards, Dave Van Ronk, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Jackson Brown and probably one or two other artists, and I have heard conflicting stories about who wrote it. I thought this video was about the song. I was especially excited that the narrator is Hoyt Axton, because his version is my favorite, though I have never seen it on his records.It's not about the song. It is an anti-drug documentary. It is however, the best anti-drug documentary I know of, like the best house in a bad neighborhood."
2,Shorty and thin material,"The dress is cute, but way to short. In addition, the material is very thin. Not impressed with this one."
1,Is it a dress or a shirt?,"The manequin that they have in the picture must be 5 feet tall if that. I am 5 foot 4 inches and this ""dress"" barely covers my butt. I think that this would work better as a long shirt than a dress."
4,Mystery Alaska,"I wasn't sure if I would like this movie because I do not like Russell Crowe at all. The only reason I agreed to sit through it was that the rest of the ensemble cast was so good. I ended up enjoying this film. Who doesn't like a film where you can root for the underdog? The hockey team in Mystery, Alaska ends up playing an exhibition game against the New York Rangers. Everyone has the same question - can they compete? This is a movie that can appeal to many because while there are some very funny moments, there is also a lot of drama."
4,Just fun,"For a hockey fan , a movie about it is always fun to watch. Besides that, it has a very good message about team work, loyalty and faith. Is a must-watch."
3,Entertaining,"Pretty much what you'd expect. Small-town guys who excel at one thing get a chance do good, prove themselves. I thought the idea of the almost-ritual tradition of the town's Saturday hockey team was interesting and wished they'd developed the idea a little. That's my big complaint: the characters and themes are underdeveloped in favor of moving along with the hackneyed storyline of amateur underdog versus professional goons. Still, the film is entertaining enough, and the hockey game at the end is well-paced and exciting without becoming outrageous. I wouldn't shell out the bucks to buy a copy, but worth renting."
3,"Hockey was great, but inconsistant overall.","The last 30 minutes of this film really saved it for me. It has action packed hockey, and moving drama. In the last 30 minutes, I finally sensed the bond and brotherhood theme of the movie. Unfortunately, the first hour and a half are not as good. The story doesn't go deep enough into the characters, there is an inconsistant mix of drama and comedy, and, even though gratuitious sex can be fun in some movies, it really hurt this one. My main point is, this movie was supposed to be about brotherhood and hockey, and it shows in the last 30 minutes, but the first part of the movie could have been better. Also, the gratutious sex and select language is why this movie got rated R. It would have been a great PG-13, and still would have got its theme accross without the gratuitous stuff. As for the DVD, you get a small ammount of features: a trailer and a 5 minute featurette."
3,Maybe It's Just Me....,Am I the only one who was bothered by the way the script dismisses Colm Meaney's wife's unjustifiable infidelity as being unimportant? Otherwise a decent piece of entertainment.
3,Underdogs with great courage on and off the ice,This isn't just a movie about hockey fans in a hockey town. It has that team spirit attitude regardless of the obstacles that get thrown their way. The lives of the characters off the ice is what's compelling. Crowe's depiction ofbeing manly yet vulnerable is a sure sign he is naturally great at acting anddestined for even greater roles. The eyes have it. I enjoyed the other actorsas well. While Hank Azaria is a good actor I don't think this role suited him.Burt Reynolds in a serious role was great as a supporting role. If you like pulling for an underdog you'll like this film.
5,Heart To Spare !,"This is such a perfect little movie, with heart and guts and just the right ammount of small-town quirkiness...A true ""crossover"" film IMO that will appeal to as many women as men and non-hockey/sports fans as well because of it's well-told story. Even with the obvious homage paid to films like ""Rocky"", ""Mystery,Alaska"" stakes it's own unique place in the underdog-genre of film with characters you can't help but care about,great outdoor winter photography, a stirring soundtrack and just superb performances by Russell Crowe, Burt Reynolds and Mary McCormack. A definite keeper for the video/DVD enthusiast to be pulled out again and again for an emotional pick-me-up..."
1,Remember slapshot this is not,If you wanna see a good hockey movie rent slapshot because this one was weak
3,Boring as can be,This movie was really boring but I do have to give this movie credit because when they were playing hockey they did a good job of acting like hockey players. And the acting was good but I think it was just the hole plot and the story climax of it was just not worth all the watching and this dose end up being a long movie. But I say you can pass this movie up unless you are a major hockey fan then you might love those scences or you might not.
1,David E Kelly please stick to tv,The only Mystery about Mystery Alaska is who greenlighted it.Every fake movie cliche you could think of was used in this.At least few people were fooled by this joke of a movie.
2,Just so Lame,"Really, this movie was flat out dumb. I have to admit there was some clever dialoge and Russell Crowe showed to be capable of dry comidy. He was really quite loveable, a take off from his typical ultra macho roles. The scenery was spectacular but the story was just so stupid and predictable. Too much profanity to be a kids film but nothing to hold an adults attention except: hope, that at some point the film would just have to get better or that Russell would show some skin, for us female fans. Unless you are a total feel good movie fan or you just have to see every Crowe film made....forget it."
1,It's a mystery why anyone would buy it.,"Another low budget Canadian stinker of a movie. Bad hockey, bad acting, bad story idea."
5,An excellent movie,"Russell Crowe is an excellent actor. This movie was a fun hockey film about a rag tag team from the little town of Mystery who have a chance to take on the New York Rangers. Don't take it too seriously, and you will have fun."
5,"The best pickup game since ""Slap Shot""","The small town Mystery, Alaska has one bondage when the ""Saturday Pick-Up"" hockey team keep in check their pride and dignity. In a town where most everyone moves by blade, the community supports their Saturday game. The team is scouted out by a New York agency that settles on that Mystery can take on the New York Rangers for fun. The game is on the pond with realism and the ice has makeshift stands and boards made of lumber to go by the NHL regulations. This was one flick that I never did say ""that couldn't happen"" because it was close to reality. The storyline touches the heart when you see how a small community can support a team that is also key government (mayor, judge, sheriff). This is worth getting and it is the best storyline for a hockey movie."
5,Great Movie!,For all of you who didnt like this movie you are nuts! I live in a small town in Alaska where hockey is one of the main sports. This movie was fun to watch and it had players that reminded me of our Hockey Team 100% Its a great movie for any true hockey fan.
3,Mystery is no mystery,"Mystery Alaska is a saturday afternoon, popcorn movie the whole family can enjoy. It had the same feel as when I used to watch Northern Exposure.Alot of quirky,funny people who's lives revolve around the simple things in life.This one being hockey.Good solid cast. Russell is easy on the eyes too!"
4,Good Movie,"This is a really good that I enjoy watching on occasion. It has a good story line, some humor, and a few good actors."
4,Hockey and Russell Crowe,Good characters and storyline. Small town hockey team faces off with a pro-hockey team that comes to town as a publicity stunt.
3,Binghamton?,"Being a fan of the Hartford Wolfpack since the team moved herein '97, I was a bit dissapointed at the end of the film. Go 'Pack!"
4,The infidelity..,"To: ""Maybe It's Just Me."" No, it's not just you. I loved this movie and wished they could have rewritten that part...maybe have Stank(?)and her caught necking or something because the married couple's relationship was an important aspect of the plot. Colm was such a stuffed shirt! Maybe you and I are a little naive to think this would've been believable to the so-called sophisticated movie goer. Also, that last comment from the little kid durng the game was stupid, but the director let him redeem himself later in the game action."
3,"Who ever thought Crowe, Azaria, Reynolds together?",When I first saw the beginning of this film.. all i could think of was RUSSEL CROWE and HANK AZARIA and BURT REYNOLDS all in the same film? To me.. it definatelty was obvious there was a miss cast.. and at first it was hard to see Russell Crowe in this film.. but he is good in it.. But I really did not like this film.. but the only reason I did was because I felt the ending really made this movie watch-able... And really the apperance in this film.. honestly do not seem to make sence!Apperances by Little Richard? Mike Myers? (well maybe b/c the same director who directed Austin Powers directed this film).. but still.. MIKE MYERS? seriously... it was kind of funny to see these group of actors work together.. And the film has a good plot.. but only if it was carried out just a little bit more stronger.. it could of been a better in my oponion.. but this movie is really they type where the ending definately makes the movie worth seeing...
1,Duped,"I purchased a DVD of a favorite movie of mine--""Mystery Alaska"" as I have always done. Little did I know, I was buying the product from a vendor in the United Kingdom. Thus, the format in the UK is different in the US and the DVD did not work. I know it's my fault--but I can't help but wonder why I was not told the vendor was out of the country, or asked if I understood the risks associated with different formats. I'm not happy with myself for this, but I feel I was a little taken advantage of by the process."
1,This movie was weak dude,Who in the world greenlighted the script on this one whoever did probably got fired it is just one GIANT cLIChe of a movie
3,"Cute stories and ideas, but terrible scientific errors","As a practicing Wiccan of several years, I enjoyed the folklore and ritual ideas presented in this book. But, as an undergraduate forestry major, I have to point out that the authors had no idea what they were doing as far as giving the plants their correct scientific names. Do yourselves a favor and use this book as a supplement to a legitimate herbal encyclopedia."
4,good for herbal remedies and recipes...,"I actually have looked this over a few times in person before I boughtit, so I can understand some dissapointment - there is little or no magickal herb stuff in here (and that is what my first impression was too, being put out by Llewellyn and all!) This ""almanac"" (which it is not really) is mostly healing, beauty and health, growing, cultivation, cooking with, using, etc., with herbs. No calendars or correspondences. I think it is great for an addition to a health or cooking herbal library, but would not stand well on its own. I found a lot of useful gardening and other misc. tips for many common herbs and good ideas and recipes for herbal remedies, recipes, and beverages (the info/recipes on making various herbal syrups was worth the price alone IMHO)."
5,Really good book,Lots of interesting information for practicing pagans. Valuable resource for solitaries and coven mates alike. Would strongly recommend to others.
4,"Light and portable, but not all that sturdy","I got this for my father to use at craft shows so that he could easily move it on his own. It is quite light and portable, so on that count, I would highly recommend it. My only complaint is that it isn't all that sturdy. It works for his needs, and it would be fine for camping or whatever, but it isn't as stable as I'd like."
1,totally disappointed,This set is a disaster. Never met spec as to viewing angle. Picture goes to color negative if you're more than 30 degrees below perpendicular. Returned 3 times to Samsung. First time I got back somebody's elses TV. Different size and model. Sent that back. Finally got mine back=same problem. Talked to service people who said send it back again. Did so and their service people called to understand the problem. Got it back and no fix. Paperwork said no problem found. Called them again and was told too bad. The specifications are guidelines only and what you got is what you get. RUN- don't walk away from SAmsung products.
2,"great image, annoying features","Looking at it in the store, it's impressive. Using it every day can be irritating.Gripes include:The screen comes on exactly 9 seconds after hitting the power button.It makes a very loud series of chimes and beeps turning it on and off - it will wake someone sleeping next to you.Setup is a bit confusing, getting it to recognize all available channels is not easy, unless you use a cable box.It's a good tv for the bathroom or kitchen.."
3,"Eh, it's alright....",I just needed a flat panel television in white to fit a particular space in my house. I don't really watch it too often. It's okay I guess.
5,Fantastic HDTV,"We live in a RV and wanted a LCD HD TV to fit in the already allocated spot without the need for the expensive brackets. So we selected this Samsung TV.We read the reviews and they were a mixed bag but overall most liked the Model.Overall we love it, the picture and ease of use is great. One small problem was the HD TV picture kept on breaking down and the sound lost it's smoothness. We solved this by buying an external cable with gold plated ends from the outside connection to the RV, it worked like a charm, now the sound and picture is great all of the time in HD.I'd recommend this model to anybody, I love Samsung products."
2,Awesome OFF,Purchased TV October 12th 2007. It is on the way to repair shop tomorrow. TV will not turn on with power button or remote. Tried to solve problem as suggested by samsung rep with no luck. I'm not that thrilled with image quality either. Hope I'm not stuck with a lemon! Next purchase will be with a retail store. At least I can return items that do not work. As an example; Costco has a 90 day return policy plus a 1 year additional warranty.
4,Good Buy,"I bought the this item as a gift. Setup is extremely easy. Bought alsoLogitech Z-4I 2.1 Speaker Systemand aPhilips DVP5960 DVD Player with HDMI, 1080i Upscaling, DivX Ultra, USB direct. The three products make up a great system at a reasonable price. First movie watched was Pirates of the Caribbean III and saw colors and details that were amazing.The only reason I do not give a 5 star is:The optimal viewing angle is very limited...about straight on.The external speakers is connected throught the earphone jack. When the unit is powered cycled, sometimes it stays that way, other times you have to reset the earphone jack to get sound over the external speakers."
4,Great TV...easy to set-up,really happy with my purchase of this TV.....sleek compact design....easy to hook-up and excellent resolution....would recommend
5,The best teaching ever on moving in the gift of prophecy,"This is a book I have known for a long time and can highly recommend. I ordered extra copies to give to friends as I would not part with my own copy. For those Christians who are interested in the gifts of Holy Spirit written about in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians chapter 12, it takes you step by step in being able to grow in confidence in using this gift, for the church and for those who do not yet have a personal relationship with Jesus. The author until a few years ago live in Southampton where he wrote this book and I had the privilege of working with him. It is required reading in several Christian seminaries but is not so cerebral that others of lesser intellect, such as myself, wouldn't be able to glean a great deal of wise help and advice. Tragically it is out of print at the moment so the only way of getting hold of it is via a second-hand copy just don't expect mine to be one of them!"
5,Just what i needed,This is the exact part that I needed to repair my furnace. Installation was easy and no problems since putting it in two months ago.
2,User Manual for a Stencil Set,"The DVD inside the ""Pinups Made Easy"" box has the title screen ""Pin-ups With Stencils"", and in fact this is a DVD focused on helping buyers use the Mahon pinup stencil set. Without the (rather pricey) stencils, the material is not nearly as helpful, and you may not learn as much as you had hoped from this video. Deborah Mahon shows how to use the two pinup stencils included in the set, Girlie Girl and Little Girlie. As a user manual for her stencils, this is a good presentation and will help you make either of two pinup images using her stencils and an airbrush. If you had hoped to learn more about the general techniques for pinup art, though, I think you'll be disappointed."
1,This DVD is not well done,"When I bought this DVD it had a nice true color pinup on the cover, which of course is NOT included in the how to. You have to have there stencils to get any use out of the video and even then it is limiting. I do not recommend it."
1,strongarm too strong,"ordered this product twice. both came defective as lift system stuck in the full open position and would not budge. would not recommend you order this from amazon unless you want defective lift supports that are stuck in the upright position. perhaps there is some safety mechanism at work here, but from hours spent on the internet and with the system, my research says they are defective. waste of time and money."
4,Brosnan Classic,"As usual Pierce Brosnan does a stellar job with an interesting and truly believable plot, no fantasy stuff involved and he's ably supported by good acting."
5,Great Quality,I love HD videos and when you put in suspense and action its even better. I like this movie and I do not know why it didn't do as good in theaters when it first came out.
3,Should Be Seen For It's Spectacular Effects.,"""Dante's Peak"" is a film that is worth seeing only for it's production, for it's incredible and convincing special effects sequences that truly entertain and keep us watching. The screenplay is just a device to put a story behind the eye candy. The story is too predictable and typical, but it's sure better than ""Volcano."" What we have here is a movie that although has good performances and some nice touches in the story, but is really driven by the cool-looking volcano, lava, debris and mud sliding down a hill with lots of smoke, a lake with water turning into acid, and let's not forget the boiling pool where a couple getting kinky gets crispy. ""Dante's Peak"" is not ""great cinema,"" but it's entertaining. I wasn't bored. In the end, it was fun."
4,good movie for the whole family,Had this movie on video cassette and liked it so much I bought a dvd. Our entire family is entertained by this movie. Nothing to be embarrassed about when watching with your children.
4,Hmmm,The only disappointment about this DVD is that the inside sleeve with the menu chapters states that it is a two sided disc with loads of extra features on it. It is not!!!!
5,"well, this movie literally blew me away!!!","when i first saw this movie, i was little and didn't understand much of it, but when i rented it from the library a few months ago, i fell in love with it, i immediately bought it and watched it over and over! God! this was such a great movie. if your lookin for a good action-packed thriller, rent this movie. trust me! YOU WILL LOVE IT!"
4,Great Special Effects,I enjoyed this movie a lot because being from Washington state the memories of Mt St Helens were refreshed in my mind. The special effects were outstanding and pretty believable.
4,A great disaster film since Earth Quake.,"Spectacular Visual Effects, make the best disaster film since Earth Quake. A good cast, good storytelling and good directing from Roger Donaldson. He direct it No Way Out, The Bounty with Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins, The Remake of The Getaway and Species. Special Visual Effects from Digital Domain, Best Known for Apollo 13, True Lies And Titanic. This film Is Co Produced by Gale Anne Hurd, She Produced The Terminator 1 and 2, Aliens and The Abyss.A great entertainment film."
5,Dante's Peak - Great Volcano Movie,"To put it short and sweet, Dante's Peak is a pretty darn good movie about Volcanic activity. Sure it fudges the laws of physics a little here and there, but the special effects are phenomenal for the movie, nothing compares. Volcano, staring Tommy Lee Jones, also debuted the same year, but it really doesn't compare.Being a Geographer, and working toward Volcanology myself, this movie uses good terminology and for the most part is pretty realistic on what really happens in a Volcanic explosion, at least of Composite Volcanoes.I give the movie 5 stars... the acting is excellent, the special effects great, and overall keeps you on the edge of your seat."
1,BAD ACTING AND BAD EFFECTS= BAD MOVIE FOR SURE!!!,"DANTE""S PEAK is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. PIERCE BROSON and LINDA HAMILTON are awful as is the volcano effects. Avoid this picture if you can help it that's all I have to say."
1,Fizz!,"When I wrote the review for ""St. Helens"" (1981), the heading says what the volcano did-""Boom!"" Now comes ""Dante's Peak"" which has a volcano that did nothing but ""fizz."" It's a price to pay to fill the movie with impossible scenarios with the same storyline from another movie. ""Dante's Peak"" is only worth the wait until the video price really depreciates."
1,DTS Alone does not make a movie!,This was one of the worst acting jobs ever done. However; I must blame the bad acting on the director and the script. If this movie was a comedy I would have rated it higher!
2,Pretty bad,"It's pretty cheesy. Supposed to be a suspense/action movie, but I laughed through a lot of it, probably even more than when watching Top Gun."
3,A Decent Volcano Movie.,"An interesting story with its moments. The build up to the eruption was great! All the little momments like the too hot hot springs! Though once the lava starts to roll, the script gets a bit unrealistic. I guess it builds suspense. All in all, a good volcano flick."
4,Great Volcano Movie,This is a Great movie But their was one part that was really un realistic When the Harry and the Wandos are crossing the Acid Lake surely the boat would have given out alot Faster and Ruth jumping in the Acid to pull the boat ashore all she had to do was scoot herself onto the peir also Harry would not be able to put his hand in the water even with the coat wraped around it Great Movie but that part
1,Completely Rediculous,"This movie was horrible! They drive a truck through lava, and even spin the wheels in it; when they escape it, the truck is fine and so are the tires. That is almost as good as the lake of acid. The acid is eating through the metal boat, but Pierce Brosnan can wrap his hand in a shirt and paddle, and his hand is perfectly fine. These are only part of the reason I found this movie one to make fun of. It was completely rediculous."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.........,"The first movie Ive seen where the making of featurette was better than the movie itself. I bought this on widescreen and Im sure after watching it once that I never will again. I dont know how you could call this better or worse than Volcano w/ Tommy Lee Jones. They both stink. It was a whole hour before anything happened then 30 minutes of boring close calls. I will give them credit for the bridge scene. I had no idea those trucks were miniatures. If you want to see a good disaster flix with LOTS of action get Daylight w/Stallone. Not great, but at least that was action throughout the entire movie."
5,DANTE'S PEAK Is A Gushing Success!!,"I Bought This Movie For My Mom's Birthday, As It Is Her Favorite. She Was Very Happy To Own It & Watched It Immediately. She Was Very Satisfied & That Made ME Very Happy. In Conclusion, A Great Transaction With A Great Seller. 10 Out Of 10."
3,Pretty good....,Dante's Peak kept me interested throughout the whole film. I think it is a little too far fetched but was good all the same.
4,Great Movie,"I liked this movie alot, it was suspenceful and fun. I also appreciated the DTS (it was worth the extra $)"
5,Very Explosive,"One of the best movies ever! Great effects! Very exiting! Everyone who is looking here, I recomend it!!!"
3,"Lots of action, little story, great special effects","Although this movie is a great action film, I found the story line to be weak. Overall, I liked the film because of the special effects which I would give a 4 star rating. The ending is unbelievable and unrealistic but I would recommend it to anyone who likes special effects."
3,Good Action,"With great special effects and great acting, I think this is one of the best blockbusters. With plenty of suspense and action, I was on the edge of my seat. It deserves some attention. Check it out."
3,HD Only Sucks,"I made the mistake of ordering this DVD. I have tried to even give the movie away,but nobody has an HD DVD play that will play it."
4,an explosively good movie,special effects bonanza with some strong performances. It's fun to watch and the special effects are excellent. Well worth watching.
5,Awesome!,I absolutely love this movie! I have watched it so many times I have no idea how many times I have watched it. Maybe 20 times at least. Volcano was okay but I love Dante's Peak.
5,greatest Christmas gift,"My dad loves this movie, along with any other natural disaster movie, and has searched for ""Dante's Peak"" on and off for a couple of years. I just happened to think about checking Amazon to see if I could find it. Amazon did have it on Blu-ray, and at the time, it was very reasonably priced. When my dad opened his gift with many other DVDs and Blu-rays, I made sure this one was opened last. He immediately wanted to know where I had found it."
3,poor feed,The movie is great but the feed was not as good as it should have been. there weretoo many paues and the movie froze a few time while the sound kept going.
5,a great film,"This is a great film. The story line okay but I was mostly suprsied at the special effects. The effects during the final eruption scenes were some of best effects I've ever scene. If you interested in disater films,this is a must see!"
4,Does what it sets out to do,"This isn't Shakespeare, and it isn't ""Citizen Kane."" What it is, is a solidly-made disaster film that makes you believe all this is possible, and it's believable because the film-makers did their homework. The picture also benefits from solid work by Pierce Brosnan (who proves he can carry a big action film even when he's not playing Bond) and Linda Hamilton (who it's nice to see playing a regular woman for a change). The special effects deliver the goods, but the most suspenseful sequence is the boat crossing the lake. This picture just wants to entertain you, and it does what it sets out to do."
4,A FABULOUS movie,"Dante's Peak is one of the BEST movies that I have ever seen that has Pierce Brosnan (for Brosnan fans), and a movie that is based on a natural disaster. Anyone who likes action movies, along with scientific stuff, Pierce Brosnan, and love stories would LOVE this movie. The only thing that bothers me is that the rubber on the tires melt extremely quickly and wouldn't be able to continue keeping its shape after being burned. But other than that, this is a great movie!"
3,Volcanic delight,"I've always been fascinated by volcanos, and have always like Pierce Brosnan doing his thing on screen also. Linda Hamilton is pretty good, though a little lost at times. The others, I hate to say, were just filler. They were never allowed to really fly, or even be more than scenery. Effects are solid, but overdone in some spots. The lead up to the actual blast is the best half. It's an ok film."
3,Not bad at all,Dante's Peak is an okay nature gone wrong movie. It's about a volcanologist who discover's that a town's dormant volcano will erupt. This movie was certainly a lot better than the horrible Twister. The special effects in Dante's Peak were incredible.
3,"DTS was great, movie was predictable.","At last DTS dvds are here, this was my first. Sound was very good. Way to go DTS.... Probably 5 to 10 % improvement on DD. However the movie was rather predictable it was still good fun to watch and listen. The LFE effects will rock the house!!"
5,Amazing special effects!,"I first had my doubts about this movie, but finally saw it. It was fantastic. Sure, it was another disaster movie, but I really liked it. The action scenes had me on the edge of my seat!!"
3,A really intense movie! I was up in my seat!,I finally got to see this movie and I really liked it. I thought the story was great. A little bit of romance and action). Although I thought some parts were unrealistic. (The truck not burning up when they drove over the lava) I loved it and I think I'm adding it to my home videos.
2,A volcanic dud,"Are you kidding me? A nice plot, but ridiculuous action scenes. Grandma pulling the boat through the acid lake--but the dock (wooden) is still standing. Grandma loses her legs even though she is shown with legs the frame before. Finally, the dog should have been fried twice. Too many impossible scenes. C'mon. At least Linda Hamilton is always easy to watch."
4,No one listens to the scientists.,"A slow starting movie, where a scientists tries to convince the political element in Dantes Peak of the ultimate danger of a volcano erupting. It builds in action & the later half of the movie has lots of action. I have both this & the movie Volcano. I think Volcano is better. It starst faster than this one."
4,Great sound and picture experience,"Well paced story in a picture perfect setting. Characters are enjoyable, but I wish each of the team characters were a little more fleshed out. You can't beat the visual and sonic quality of this blu-ray disc. The volcano eruption seems to come out of the TV screen. A lot of fun for a Saturday afternoon movie."
4,good movie,don't really see much of a difference from a regular DVD or a blu-ray but either way it's a good movie!
5,A must see.,The acting is great and the plot is great. It is a good action disaster movie. I highly recommend seein it.
3,Movie review,"I finally got a copy of this movie, the first one sent to me was damaged. The photography was the reason I purchased it. It shows Mt St. Helen's photos that are suppose to be Dante's Peak. Story line is OK, believable."
3,SEX IN WATER : HOT BUT DANGEROUS,"Let's return to the catastroph movies of the seventies. Now special effects have improved, there's more money in the business and the audience waits for such films.Roger Donaldson made a correct movie with the written material he had but extremely anonymous ; a dozen hollywood directors could have been able to direct this movie.The beginning of Dante's peak made me think of Jaws. You know ! there's only one guy in town who sees the catastroph coming and nobody is listening to him. Except the audience, of course !Linda Hamilton is great, Pierce Brosnan stony as always, the scenery wonderful and the volcano mean and hot.A DVD to rent when it's cold outside"
5,Its one of the best movies I have seen........,"It is a really cool, film, its funny when the grandma gets out the boat and burns her legs in the water. I like the bit where harrys boss falls off the bridge. I think the dog is so cute, I like the end where they all get saved."
3,Three stars for being a parody--if it is,"Do you say you love disaster movies? This volcano flick takes all the cliches and throws them into a half-baked plot that will keep you laughing all the way, after the first victims are boiled alive in a suddenly-scalding pool. Everything in this potboiler is predictable but so far-fetched that it becomes almost the prototypical MST3K movie, except you can provide your own jeers. It's hard to believe they were serious as they filmed it--but if they were, I pity their maturity. I prefer to think that they were chuckling and trying to figure out what else to throw in to put it over the top."

4,Great animation history. Too short!,"For those expecting a nice long viewing, it'll be a disappointment. For those who want a history of Pixar's great rise to the top of animation with a behind the scenes look at modern animation techniques, this is one for your library. All in all, a pretty important work."
3,"Great, but not quite there yet.","Some of the short films, especially ones after Toy Story were good, but there are only 8 in there. These 8 in terms of quality were very good and my personal favorite was For the Birds. Everything else was a little short and had no story to it. It was more of a technical demo back in the 80's and nothing extraordinary there, both picture quality wise and audio wise. They really should have priced this disc at half the cost and sold it on amazon for $9.99. Otherwise, I have to agree with others that it's not worth this price."
2,"Save your money, and create this ""compilation"" yourself","If you already own the Pixar movie collection on DVD, then you already own the license to view all of the ""shorts"" on this dvd compilation except for ""THE ADVENTURES OF ANDRE AND WALLY B."" and ""RED'S DREAM"" (which you can download from iTunes much cheaper).I liked the idea of the compilation, so I created my own ""music-mix tape"" equivalent by extracting each of these ""shorts"" from their respective DVDs that I own, and even extracted shorts from other movies such as Ice Age, and Over the Hedge to include on the final compilation DVD as well.I then burned my own DVD of all of these shorts (Legal in the US if you own all the original DVDs, and it is a ""compilation"" for your own use and not redistributed or provided for others).You get the benefit of the ""compilation"" but can even add to it, and save yourself the overpriced collection offered here..."
4,"Fun, quick bluray","I like many of the pixar shorts, so it was great to have them all in one easy to access place. That being said, there's probably only 45 or so minutes of shorts. Still worth it for me though."
5,Gift for my Husband,This was purchased as a gift for my husband. It arrived in perfect condition and he is thrilled with it.
4,Pixar short films true to form,"If you like Pixar movies you will enjoy the short films. All the short films are varied, very creative, and entertaining!"
4,CUTE,"If you like the disney or pixar movies, you will love the short films. Some are funny, some are touching, all of them are super cute!!"
5,pixar short films,"Some of the short films are familiar, but some were not.Also the extras like the commentary were very good."
4,Future classic!,"This collection of shorts shows exactly how Pixar's brilliance outgrew Disney's throat-grip contractual relationship. These are all the iconic bits that made Pixar famous: from the little desk lamp through Birds on a Wire (which will have me rotfl forever), to Jack Jack Attack --- the cute little back-story of ""The Incredibles"".This is a must-have, if only for parties --- I love to hear the surprised laughter from those who've never seen these shorts, and the ""No wait! No wait! Here it comes!"" from the ones who have."
1,Not what we expected from Disney Pixar,"We are a family that can't get enough of our favorite movies. When we saw Disney Pixar had come out with a DVD focusing on short films we were thrilling, thinking it would be something a little different for our twin boys. From the moment the first short film began I became skeptical. Short is an understatement to the length of the film, if you can even consider it a film. My 2 yr olds were everything but interested in any of the short films. Typically we have been happy with most if not all of the movies we have seen, even keeping the parents entertained. This DVD fell completely short of that. I certainly feel we overpaid for a DVD that did not offer much in terms of entertainment."
1,So Disappointed! Misrepresented,"I feel like this DVD was very misrepresented. I thought it was going to be the same great Pixar shorts that I have seen on TV several times. Instead there were 5 or so skits that I had never seen before and honestly they werent funny and apparently very old.Make sure you know what is in this before you buy it- Apparently Pixar is going to milk these for all they are worth since this in volume 1. Poor struggling Pixar, they must need the money..."
1,Sheesh,"Wow, I wished I could have the time I wasted watching this movie back. It was horrible. It's basically some scenes that Pixar used to help create some of their movies. If you buy it, you've been warned."
1,VERY BAD,"It's not worth for the money I paid. Its very boring. My children doesn't like to watch this. This DVD might have been great if it was made 15+ yrs back. All the animations were pretty basic and don't feel like watching second time. It's not worth keeping a DVD at home.. Recommend you to watch by renting and later you could buy if required. I know, you might lose rental cost if you plan to buy."
3,A lot of the old shorts,"Our whole family loves the pixar short films, but especially my 2 year old son. I was expecting a few more of the newer shorts to be on this DVD. The old ones get a little boring for the younger audience and are VERY short. All in all I like the movie but dont know if I would buy it again."
4,"A little short, but extremely entertaining","Each short shows the progression of technology, yet the stories and charm have always been there from the beginning of Pixar. From their humble beginnings to the animation giant they are now, we get a peek into the company that revolutionized the way society looks at computer generated animated feature films. Although many of the shorts can be found on most of the Pixar feature film DVDs/ Blu-Ray discs, the commentary is great for anyone who would like to understand what was going on in the computer animation industry, as well as within Pixar themselves. Plus having all of their shorts on one DVD prevents anyone from having to search through which feature film a short was on. The bonus features from Pixar are entertaining as usual!"
4,happycamper,"The shorts were nice to have all in one spot, saves searching all the DVD's to find the particular short the kids are looking for. Thought it was a little overpriced for what it contained, but the kids are happy."
4,Best of the shorts,"As an avid collector of animated films, I enjoy the little ""extras"" found in DVD's. This grouping of shorts is wonderful - they're sowell-imagined and executed, I laugh no matter how many times I watch!Well done!"
4,Good compilation,"Got this last christmas and I really enjoyed it. Regular Pixar quality (= the funniest animated shorts around), but I wish there was more content on the disc. The ""History of Pixar"" featurette is informative and entertaining, but could be sooo much longer, I'm sure."
5,Pixar Short Films,I love this DVD. I have seen many Pixar shorts but I have never seen all the ones shown on this DVD. Thank you to whoever came up with the idea to make this collection.
2,Great but way overpriced collection,"This is a great collection of animated shorts. However, with the exception for the 'story of' featurette, it's 100% recycled material. Don't get me wrong, it's nice to see them all in one place, but $25 (or even $20) is a complete ripoff without anything NEW. They're almost all on the older DVD's someplace, so unless you're the type of person that likes to pay for the same thing multiple times, skip buying this one and just rent it on netflix."
2,Pixar Short Films,"I've seen a few of the short films in other Pixar movies, so I thought it would be cool to see the other ones. The movies start in the 80's and go to the present. The best(few) ones are within the last 5 years, and, for some reason, they were the ones I've already seen. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't being sold at a movie price. All in all, I think everyone would get more satisfaction and entertainment out of almost any movie. Yes, I'm not buying volume 2."
2,not all english,"Although I love these videos, I was disappointed to find my disc is not all English. The titles which are not a peice of the animation are not in English. Luckily, most of the disc is. Still very dissapointed, especially since it was a gift to someone. I will not be buying 3rd party amazon ever again... burned too many times."
3,granddaughter loved it,"I bought this fro my granddaughter for xmas, they loved it. I makes for a great traveling vidoe for short trips.I ordered it and received it right a way."
3,It's a collector's item.,"I love Pixar movies. I think they're some of the best movies out there. But, ya know, over half of the animations on here are from Pixar's early days, so they're not that great. Granted, they were awesome for their time, but if you want to buy this for purely entertainment value, it's not worth it so much. Again, I really like Pixar, so I don't regret my purchase, I just wish it was a bit more entertaining."
3,PIXAR DVD,"As much as I love Pixar and their animation, this DVD was a little disappointing. It takes you back to the first one and then upwards to one of the latest. Most of the shorts are just seconds long. I'm sure there's not much more than an hr+ of animation. However, it was fun to see some of the shorts that I remember seeing in the movie theatres. If you love Pixar animation, you will enjoy this no matter how short it is..."
3,A slight disappointment,"This compilation would probably be better suited for someone interested in the history of computer animated shorts. While it did contain the beloved shorts I was looking for, the others the disc included left much to be desired. It might be good for keeping young kids entertained. If you are simply a Pixar short fan like me, stick to only buying the movies you like with the shorts on them. It's not worth the money for the two times you'll probably watch this DVD."
3,"Non-essential, and too expensive, given the length","While no one can question the landmark status of Luxo Jr., and For the Birds is arguably the funniest short film to be produced in the last 20 years, all of the material on this disc has been available elsewhere for some time. And if you happen to have previously purchased Ratatouille and Cars on Blu-ray, you already have HD versions of some of this material, rendering this disc even less essential.The supplemental material - the commentary, and in particular the documentary outlining the history of Pixar - are the most valuable aspect of this disc, and almost make up for its very short length overall.""Completeists"" will want to purchase this disc, but if you are not the sort of fan who must own every scrap of material Pixar ever produced in HD, then I recommend giving this a pass. Spend your money on something of real value instead."
3,another good movie,it is very entertaining moviegood for other relatives especially young ageuseful for my daughter reference in animation major
4,"Fun for kids, too","Entertaining for the short attention span. High quality animation that looks spectacular in Blu-ray HD. Highly recommended for anyone's HD library, but especially if you entertain young children."
4,Pixar Shorts,"We enjoyed this DVD, but were disappointed that the shorts were all ones that were special features from past Pixar movies. Pixar makes great movies and shorts."
2,Not worth watching,I was advised that this DVd was not worth getting and I did not listen. My grand kids and I thought it was a waste of time.
3,Just buy the pixar FILMS.,The Pixar shorts were a disappointment for me... and quite boring. I should have bought one of their full length movies instead. Thats just my opinion though...
2,Very poor Content,In this case the cost-benefit relation is very low. The product contains very old animation and we have seen many others and more recent in the movies. Is not fair to pay such a price for such short DVD and without the most representative short films.
2,Pixar Shorts,This is a great and unique opportunity to view Pixar's shorts. Included are interviews with the creators plus several other options which many may find of interest. However don't buy this DVD with children in mind as the set-up and choices are difficult to navigate. I found it to be geared perhaps to IT majors or others in the business of animation.
3,Ok but the tv version is better,Taped this on the Disney channel. My 2 kids (1 and 3) love it. I bought this for them for Christmas. Was a little disappointed that not all of the shorts are on it and there are credits after every short. No worth the almost $20 in my opinion. Should have just left it on my DVR.
1,Not enough material for a Blu-Ray disc at $24.99,"This Disc does not have enough material to fill a disc. If you are a PIXAR fan, please buy their movies, you'll probably get these short stories there. I feel ripped off for [...]. This is more like a Bonus DVD that comes with a movie DVD. Nothing new."
3,Not Wonderful. Not terible.,"This is your typical sequil, except none of the original stars appear in this version. If it weren't cheap, I would not have purchased this DVD."
3,I expected more,"The short movies are nice, but I expected more short movies not only thirteen. And the total time of the DVD is 1 hour."
4,Earlier Pixar Short Films,"I purchased this volume along with volume 2 of the short Pixar films. This has some very, very early and, therefore, less refined Pixar short films on it.But this is a no less entertaining volume."
4,Good kids movie,"Quality of the product is excellent. Pixar is great as well, better for the kids. I would recommend this to others."
5,Grandchildren say OK (laughs a lot),Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
2,Short is a good name for it...,I purchased in Blu-Ray and I wasn't over all impressed with it (I definitely over paid for what I got). It's 54 minutes but when you back out credits its much less. I am a huge Pixar fan so it was neat to see some of the old films but I have seen most of these before on their movies (part of the extras of Pixar movies). I maybe saw three films I haven't yet seen. But they are short - If I were to purchase all over - I wouldn't waste my money.
2,Lacking variety,"For the price most Blu ray's comes with either a DVD version or a Digital Copy, this has none of those. Disney needs to reissue this with the other two versions for this price."
3,Another overpriced Disney DVD.,"I enjoyed all the animated shorts here, and would rate them four stars as a whole. The Cars short is lacking though. My problem is with the price of $20.You can probably find it on sale at Wal-Mart for $15-$17 on it's release date. Even then, is it really worth it for a collection of animated shorts under an hour, some of which are already on Pixar DVDs we already own? This is also only the first volume, which means they can get more money out of fans with later releases. I had the same problem with the DVD release of the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles (see my review)."
5,5 stars for Pixar Shorts!,"This collection of short movies by Pixar is fun and entertaining. They are original and very creative with great animation sequences and wonderful facial expressions. It is so easy to watch them over and over again. There are interesting commentaries included that provide glimpses into the creative minds behind the stories. My 2 year old grandbabies really enjoy watching them because they are short enough to keep their attention and they can pick and choose which ones they want to watch. They have made up their own titles for each ""short"". I highly recommend this DVD for anyone of any age. Enjoy!"
5,Just Awsome...,"Not only do you get all of the Pixar shorts all on one disc, but you also get a great piece of history. Just getting to see the progression of computer animation is wonderful. A must have for all animation fans."
1,Warning about a poorly performing product,"I have never felt strongly enough to write a review, until this piece of junk. This West Bend toaster performed poorly when I received it and has become progressively worse.I gave up on the West Bend today, and bought a GE bagel toaster at Wal-Mart. The GE is a marvel compared with the West Bend."
1,"Awful product, no quality control, stay away!",We took the boxed toaster out of the packing box from Amazon. Obvious grease stains were all over the box. I opened the box and the smell of unremoved machinery lubricant was overpowering and made our family ill. The unit was factory packed and sealed so West Bend quality control (if such a thing exists in China!) really dropped the ball. We sent this unit back and bought a Kaloric instead.
4,Why can't the English have such good lyrics as the French?,"This CD has two utterly superb songs - Parce Que and L'Émigrant. The latter shows just how good Aznavour was at combining haunting tunes with lyrics that are worth understanding, unlike most Anglo-American rubbish where neither the tune, nor the lyrics can be said to have anything going for them. Unfortunately, the title song (Le Feutre Tauppé) is the least impressive song on the CD - don't let that put you off!"
1,TROUBLE,"This is not a easy fit for your hose. You have to find an addaptor or something, it doesn't fit!"
4,"No frills in ""The Crossing""","This movie glimpses into almost everyone's high school days. A time of self awareness and emotions like love, anger, jealousy and that yearning to belong, to be cool. Also one of recklessness. These strong feelings and actions are brought to the forefront by three close friend actors. Actor Russell Crowe displays his burgeoning talent with his one-time girlfriend Danielle Spencer and best friend Robert Mammone, who he will later star with in ""Heaven's Burning."" This film is simple but powerful in its simplicity. Being a teenager is not easy and the actors give a credible performance using their talent and their youth itself to portray this difficult age. ""The Crossing"" is a faithfull reflection about young passions and first love."
4,Russell Crowe in a Sweet Early Work,"If you wonder who he was, then see this one first. Russell Crowe's first substantial role - as a young man in love with the even younger Danielle Spencer, in a small town Australian drama that's simple,touching and unglamourized -which adds to its effect. Russell, as the good-hearted local lad, is trying to keep his girl whose first love has moved on to the city and then without warning returns for her. Which is about where we enter. Who will she choose or betray; whose life will she decide she can abide? We are of course rooting for Russell. This film will remind you of Rebel Without A Cause. It's a lovely little piece, pretty undemanding of the viewer (who won't find a Bud White here), yet surprisingly engaging, and just a glimpse into this great talent."
5,Friends for life?,"A great little movie. The images may be a bit heavy-handed but contribute to the story's portrayal of how the 3 main characters work their way through a pivotal day. We are skillfully drawn in to their emotional turmoil as they respond to feelings of loyalty, commitment and responsibility. Robert Mammone is beautiful, Danielle Spencer is enigmatic, and Russell Crowe is a wonderfully frustrated & confused young man in love. Not to be missed!"
2,don't waste your time,"This movie was a complete waste of time. The only possible people who could relate to it would be those unfortunate enocugh to grow up in some awful Australian town. For Russell Crowe fans, don't even bother-he is wearing these really hideous tight white pants and looks like a cast member from ""Saved by the Bell"". The story is depressing, and has been done about a thousand times via crappy Warner Brothers movies in the 1950's. I've seen better Perry Mason episodes. All in all-yuck."
4,Young Crowe,"Great little film, Good performances by all, first look a Mr. Crowe as a younster....A good preview of what was to come from this amazing actor."
4,Predictable but a good story; some anachronistic music,"This is a good, if predictable, story of two young men who love the same woman in a small town in Australia in the 1950s. Crowe and his future wife, Danielle Spencer, do a nice job together as two of the people involved in this love triangle. Some of the music is supposed to be 50s-ish but sounds a bit too modern."
3,Interesting Movie Primarily Because of Russell Crowe,"This story of teenage angst and growing up in late 1950's (I think) Australia covers no ground not covered more interestingly elsewhere. I thought most of the characters were somewhat cardboard if not downright irritating, although the cast did the best it could with the been-there-done-that saga about two young men smitten with the same rather dreary girl. Russell Crowe, while very young looking, is clearly the best thing in it and projects a certain magnetic quality which foreshadows his later triumphs. He is really the only reason for seeing the movie."
3,"Small town, teen angst, and fast cars highlight this movie",Just when you think a retro movie is predictable the end throws you a curve.Russell Crowe fans will want to see it out of curiousity. Crowe met his now wife Danielle Spencer who co-stars with him in this movie. While actors did a good job it is still just an average movie.
2,ALMOST BORING!,"The only good thing about this movie is Russell Crowe and Danielle Spencer but even these two fine actors together couldn't bolster my interest or enjoyment of the movie. Very sappy, sickeningly sweet love story. I gave it two stars: one for Russell and one for Danielle."
4,Love only Russell,Only reason to get this movie is because of Russell. He is great in his first film role. Did not need the nudity in this. Story could have been better.
2,Movie lacks spark.......,"We have become accustomed to viewing Russell Crowe films with a certain expectation of good, quality acting. And in this case his portrayal of a young in love, small town boy was on target. But the rest of the cast make this film unbearable to watch.Robert Mammone as Crowe's rival does a decent job, but Danielle Spencer as the object of both their affections, falls flat on her face. In the end she hasn't convinced anyone that she has the capibility to love anyone. She comes off as selfish and cold.I really hated this movie."
2,Not quite what I expected!,"This film is from nineties,but action is placed much earlier!I personaly didn't like the story too much!There are many strange moments in the movie which is quite boring,and doesn't have much of australian beautiful scenry!What is suppose to be shocking is kind of silly!-like the end of the movie!And actors look ugly!"
1,"Looks good, poor quality","I've bought two of these kettles and it looks great. Unfortunately I've had to return two of these kettles because of the poor quality plastic used in the handle. In each return (and even some boxes that I opened in a store) the problem was the same: the platic handle broke. I guess the outward pressure of the metal portion of the handle is too strong for the plastic used and it snaps. When it happened once, it could be a fluke. It happened twice, I'm starting to get suspicious. I open boxes in a store and see the same problem and we have a design flaw. I've given up on this kettle and will keep looking for a stylish kettle."
3,Looks better than performs,"I bought one of these and returned it. First, the one I had had a little chip in the enamel. The whistle is so anemic that if you put it on the stove and go out of the room and think you're going to hear the whistle - forget it. You will burn up the pot. It has a nice but gimmicky pouring device - ball bearing in the spout. It always sounds like there's something in the pot when it moves around, but it does prevent any drips from coming out. I also thought it was awkward and heavy, but I""m used to the Revere ware style of kettle. If you don't care whether the thing whistles or not, try this."
3,"Really like this kettle, but problem with screen","I've only had this kettle for a couple of months, but I really, really like it and it seems to be of very good quality. Handle doesn't get hot, pours nicely (not slow), heats quickly, and the whistle sounds like a little bird. I was planning to buy a Kitchen Aid kettle, but changed my mind when I compared it with this one at the store.Update after 6 months: Still love the kettle, but the screen that holds the whistle ball has black deposits on it (could be rouge, if it's not the right grade of steel for the application). Replacement had the same issue. Copco has offered to replace it with another model."
1,The quality is not there,"I've used this teakettle for a few months before the lid knob broke off and there was no way to open it except to stick a knife and try to get it out. There seemed to be no way to re-attach the lid knob. No issues with the handle and it is a pretty nice looking tea pot, it just does not last."
2,Not the same quality as it used to be,"I had this tea kettle years ago and loved it. When it was time for me to replace it, I wanted the same one. I ignored all the bad reviews because I had my own positive opinion about my old kettle. I should have believed the negative reviews because I hate this kettle. The ball that makes the whistle kept falling out the first week I used it. I finally jammed it in good enough that it stopped but the spout got very rusty quick and the handle is way too hot! This kettle looks nice and looks like it did years ago, but the quality is awful. I gave one extra star for looks, but I would never buy again and do not recommend at all."
1,This kettle has so many flaws,"This is a handsome tea kettle but it functions very poorly. Let's start with the package insert that came with the kettle that instructs us to empty & DRY the inside of the kettle after each use. Honestly. Who does that? Just emptying the kettle is an uncomfortable task - as others have noted, you have to tilt the kettle 180 degrees just to pour it. I've taken to pouring mine ""back handed"" to avoid wrist discomfort and if I pour too quickly it dribbles down my hand. Here's the flaw that bugs me the most: the little screen in the spout has completely rusted in the course of a few months & collects pet hair (no I'm not a slob - I keep my kitchen as tidy as the next average-non-Felix-Unger-gal). I have yet to find a way to clean this little screen. Yuck. Copco, it's a tea kettle - why would you use a metal in the spout that's prone to rust?!"
1,Rip Off,"I searched long and hard for the perfect tea kettle. This definitely was not it! What a waste! After just a month or two the handle came loose on the top. After a few more months, the metal in the bottom was floating around in the water. Yuk! Yuk Yuk!"
2,Pours Slow and leaks,We had to return this because it pours out slow where you have to tilt the pot a full 180 degrees. We mainly need a tea pot to heat up our kids bottles. So we find ourselves pouring the thing forever as well as it leaks from the top and where the handle is connected. From China equals not good. The little whistle function worked ok but not worth the hassle to not have to flip the little lever to open up the spout.The main thing is that it leaks and that shouldn't happen on a $40 tea pot.
1,"Copco's tagline: ""Better By Design""------NOT!","I've had mine for several months. It looks really nice and blends into my stove area quite well. However, like what others have reported it suffers from many design flaws. I'm sad to report another flaw: the lid comes apart.The lid is made up of two pieces. On closer inspection of the lid I found it's not held together by rivets, weld, or even screws-----it's just held together by bent metal. Really?! Didn't they know the lid is the most used part of a teakettle since one has to remove it to add water?! Especially in this model since one can't pour water through the spout since it has a metal ball in the spout to make the kettle whistle.Seriously---it's just a teakettle for cryin' out load! How can one manage to mess it up? Teakettles are meant to last decades---not months. I hope not they didn't make too many of these----since most will probably be discarded. I never knew a teakettle would have a large carbon footprint."
1,Warning!,This pot Broke into two parts! Thank goodness nobody was hurt. I saw the pot looked funny while I was filling it and realized the top portion of the pot was seperating from the bottom. Called Copco and they are sending me a return lable. We'll keep you posted.
5,Perfect Christmas gift for my daughter,"Spent an enormous amount of time comparison shopping for the perfect teakettle and this met all of my expectations. Wanted quality and something special as this was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves it! A new college grad and on a budget, she would have never considered ""splurging"" for a teakettle this nice."
2,Copco fusion stainless steel tea kettle,"This is not exactly a review because I did not keep the kettle I purchased. I purchased it initially because of its handsome appearance and advertised drip-proof spout. I returned it because of the steel ball and screen whose function I did not understand, and the clerk could not figure it out either. Can anyone explain it?"
4,Made in the shade,"This is a great book for anyone who has a lot of shade and don't know what to do with it or for those who are wanting shade! For those who already have shade, the author shows how you can have a fabulous garden using a variety of plants that provide dramatic leaf structure and some that even flower. Of course not all shade is the same and the various types of shade are explained. Some typical problems concerning shade gardening, such as dry shade or excessive moist shade, is discussed as well. Over 300 plants are profiled individually in the last half of the book. For gardeners who want more shade, a list of shade trees and shrubs is provided. Most helpful is a section of shade garden designs based on various themes (Victorian, Japanese, Native, etc.)."
5,A cozy delight,"This was the first of the series that I had read -- and I didn't feel that somehow I'm missed out on the character development. Admittedly, the plot is a bit creaky for 2002 -- but it certainly harkens back to the golden heyday of mysteries in 1923, the time in which the story is set. It was a fun read. So much so that I'm going to get all the others, too. I'm just sorry I didn't discover Daisy Dalrymple sooner."
3,Tuck Unit Guide,A little general for my taste. It gave me good ideas go to from but nothing was specific enough to really use in my classroom. It also was very elementary..if you're thinking of working with 7th graders or even 6th graders on this book I'm not sure this is the right product.
1,One of the worst textbooks around,Normally I don't have problems reading the texts schools use but this one is the worst book I've ever had to read. My instructor provided outlines of each chapter that were provided by the author. Without those I would not have been able to make heads or tails of this book.The author needs to ake this book less dry and more learning friendly.
4,Great fragrance!,This parfum rocks! I loved.I don`t really like J-lo but this parfum is the best one she release
3,Good for a MAN!,"I have this perfume & it smells like cologne. For a second I thought maybe I got it mixed up and it was for a man, but then I realized that it wasn't. I might give this to my boyfriend to wear."
1,Wow! Creative editing!,"Heard the cd...found it trite and boring... Went to her web site, saw that she hasn't done a gig in ages ( she must be popular!)and that she hasn't had a paying gig in years ( really popular!) ... Also noticed someone removed the poorer reviews of her album here and replaced them with reviews from her mom... Interesting...maybe she wrote all of the new reviews herself?Makes you wonder, doesn't it?"
1,Need more muscle!,Too hard to activate. I have a good grip but couldn't activate most of them.i even tried stepping on li.
1,did i get a box of duds?,"I order these hot packs for my daughter who suffers with chronic pain, we have popped 3 packs and all three of them barely get warm. I am disappointed that I spend all the money for 24 instant hot packs that do not even get warm. In fact, when they are first popped they get very cold. We make sure all the stuff is completely mixed up, and the pack becomes barely warm. What a waste of money. Will not buy again."
5,My brother loved it.,I had this sent to my brother. He has a keyboard and he wanted to play some of the songs he knew growing up. He told me he has a few mastered.
1,NOT SO GOOD FOR YOU...,I WASN'T TOLD THAT THE BOOK WAS FALLING APART AND HAD TO BE TAPED TOGETHER TO STAY TOGETHER.IT SAID JUST LIKE NEW NOT IT'S BEEN THROUGH WORLD WAR TWO. I WANT MY MONEY...I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. IT ALSO THE FIRST SEVEN PAGES MISSING. WHAT IS THAT...
1,Garmin DVD software for eTrex Ledgend Cx,"Very difficult if not IMPOSSIBLE to use. The unlock feature of these products is so good, even the leagl user can't use them!"
3,Google Maps has nothing to fear,"When it comes to setting up a more complex route, Google Maps beats this hands down, but if you want that info in your Garmin GPS you don't have much choice than to use this. Only shows the total distance for a route, not to the different waypoints you might have programmed. Adding a waypoint requires you to find it first, save it, and then add it to a route. And if you interupt a route along the way, when you resume it your GPS will try to get you back to the original starting point, and then it will skip all the remaining waypoints in your route, only showing the final destination.In a nutshell, the user interface needs a serious overhaul.Wish it was Mac compatible. Works OK on a PC, but the transfers of data can take up to 20 minutes (when routes that touch 7 states are in the system), and if you try to skip the maps part thinking they're already in the device you will be sorely disappointed."
2,Tough installation,"Garmin's map products seem to have three problems:1. They're overpriced.2. Their installation program consistently fails, at least on my PC.3. ""Technical support"" is available only M-F, 8-5, and they take several days to respond to email queries.It would be nice if 3rd party mapping products, such as Delorme's Topo USA, worked on Garmin's GPS units. They don't and if one wants to have maps on the GPS unit, one is stuck with Garmin's software.Three such products, including City Navigator, failed to install cleanly on my PC (running Win 2K SP 4). I hever could install to the C: drive on my machine, instead setting for an installation on f: The unsuccessful attempts at installation left behind a trail of files, folders, and registry entries that I had to clean out manually before getting that far.I would not recommend this software for someone not adept at deepest, darkest Windows. But as noted, if you have a Garmin GPS unit, you're a captive customer."
3,Extremely dated information,"I was surprised at how dated the information on points of interest (restaurants, stores, etc.) was. There were locations identified near us that had closed close to 4 years ago. I was assuming places that closed/opened less than a year ago would be incorrect, but 4 years seems pretty excessive.We live in an older, established area so the roadway system hasn't changed. Based upon the accuracy of the points of interest, I would be concerned with the currency of the roadway information if you live in a new, growing area."
3,great map but adding units suck,"The detail of the maps proovided with this is wonderful. The problem comes when you have to add extra GPS units to it. The licensing is good for 2 units, adding a third license is the same price as the original software, which is stupid. I ended up purchasing a second map so I could get 4 licenses for the price of 3. So the map gets 4 stars, but the licensing gets a 2."
4,How did I get along with out it?,"Simply the best thing I have purchased for my Garmin Vista Cx.It has the detail of the roads I wanted from the start of using a GPS unit.It needs to be cleared up, the matter of it can only be loaded on a computer2 times. You can load it on a computer as many times as you want. Garmin will only let you use it, or I should say support it, with 2 of their GPS units.I have never been sorry I purchased it, Kinda a little pricey...KB"
2,Must have if you have Garmin 705,"If you actually want to know where your going or when to turn, you NEED this for the 705. The device cant hold the whole world on it apparently. Weird that my car can on a DVD.Just need to make these devices hold more flash memory. For the Price of the Garmins they should hold sizes like smart phones. Real big gripe for me. GARMIN get with it.Other then that, easy to use and install. Annoying but its your only option."
2,"Good, but missing many POIs","I find that many Points of Interest (POIs) are missing. As an example if I search for a particular chain store in town I get 5 results while there are actually 11 listed in the phone book. All 11 have been around for years so it's not a problem of being too new. I find this same result over and over as I search for dining, stores and other businesses. For me this really diminishes the usefulness of the product."
4,Terrific product,"Already have a Garmin and my original data set was loaded by retailer. So I was a bit confused about how to load data from disc initially, but after a quick response through Garmin's service group I was up and running."
5,Worth the money,"Have used the MapSource Topo program for years, but really like the turn by turn directions City Navigator produces on my new Garmin 76 Csx GPS.It also worked nicely with the free iRoute software on my laptop and when hooked up to the GPS gives me a great car nav system with voice instructions."
3,Can be used on a Mac with GuestPC,"I have a Garmin GPSmap 96C and an iBook (G4). I was able to install MapSource without difficulty using GuestPC (version 1.9.7) running Windows98 SE. Further, it was easy to select maps and transfer to my GPS via the USB port, although I'm sure it took longer that it would on a PC. (Garmin-where is the Mac version that was promised by the end of 2006?)The MapSource database is quite detailed with an incredible number of restaurants, hotels, hospitals, points of interest, etc. The route creation feature works flawlessly and offers practical options (fastest route, shortest route, etc.)My dislikes are the cumbersome method of registration/authentication and value. The registration process requires an online connection and your GPS serial number and seems unnecessarily complicated. The cost seems rather high for a database that will require regular updating to remain current. These two factors prevent me from giving a higher rating."
4,good navigation software,"I've been using the navigation software for some time, it exceeded my expectations, worked fine in my garmin portable nav. device (etrex venture cx), the reason for the 4 stars is the price, still too expensive."
3,Garmin holds you over an expensive barrel!,"While I like the Garmin GPS I have (the extrex venture cx), I don't like being forced to spend over $100 more to buy a local map coverage DVD. I think I read in another review that Microsoft's Pocket Streets won't work on a Garmin GPS, but I had to try it for myself and find out it doesn't. (Pocket Streets does work on my Navman GPS/PDA combo that I have). I actually prefer Pocket Streets to this Garmin software, even though the turn by turn option and distance calculator aren't available. The distance calculations seem to be quite a ways off in terms of mileage anyway though. On a good note, this Garmin software does have the address and phone numbers and offers navigation to points of interest in this software."
1,Not the latest version.,"I used to be a huge Garmin fan, but they have really mucked this up. The version that gets sent to you is v8. As soon as you install it, they tell you that v9 is available and that you ""may"" be charged $75 for the upgrade. (To which I inquired and let's just say you ""will"" be charged.) I then found out that the v9 is actually a stand-alone, and not an upgrade version, so I could have saved money by going straight for the supposed ""upgrade."" I think at this point I'll save the $75 and put it towards a non-Garmin unit.I am also having major problems with it in Vista, but hope installing it on my XP Pro laptop will at least make the DVD usable.Disappointing, at best."
4,As good as any other vehicle navigation software,"I've used this product for about 3 months. It works excellent in routing and rerouting, giving instructions, etc. (make sure your unit is compatible for that function). I've got it installed in my GPSMAP 60 csx and it works great. Lots of POI's. Only one complaint with this: You can't use the Topo at the same time in the same area. So if you are a hiker and use Topo maps, you'll have to manually switch in and out of City Navigator to get one or the other to work. They do not overlay. Kind of a pain - but that's what we have to deal with. I recommend this software to someone who wants both geographical use and road use for their GPSMAP model 60."
2,Expensive for what get.,"There has been a glitch from the beginning that always want me to start my trips by going around the block first, no matter where I start. Then it starts reminding me that it is out of date, and I can purchase a newer version. Other than that it seems to be standard GPS data."
2,multible units,The item north american map for garmin unit street pilot lll is o k for one unit but if you own 2 you need to SPEND about 80.00 more to get a NEW CODE to program other unit. I personaly think this is eccessive. I have the disc which I paid over 80.00 to program my units which I have 2 one in my truck and one in my car. No reason for more codes.
4,The iQue 3600 is still supported!,"Nice to see that Garmin is still providing a map product for this older platform. It's a backup to my newer Nuvi 760 but still works well especially after a battery transplant. The updated maps database and points of interest are nice to have. The only reason I knocked off a star in the rating is because it takes (in my case) HOURS to upload the maps to the SD card. But once it's done, you're good to go. Thank you Garmin!"
1,What a crock!,"There are two problems here. One is that despite the reviews of others, I didn't get a 2008 map despite ordering and receiving it in the last 2 weeks. The copyright on the unlock coupon is 2007 but when you actually install and unlock the map, garmin tells you that this is actually the 2007 map produced in April 2006. In order to get the 2008 map you have BUY the update from Garmin for $75.Second is that even on the 2006 map I can't get the map, neither on the handheld nor on the PC, to find addresses I want in NYC. I tried my own address (this building went up in 1927), but I can't even get the street. I tried a resturant on Union Turnpike in queens, there is no Union Turnpike listed.I am underwhelmed by the handheld 60CSX as well but I could live with the onscreen keyboard if the maps worked.I was thinking to go for the new Edge but after my experience with this map there is no way I'd ever deal with Garmin again."
1,City Navigator?? City Select?? MetroSelect????????,What a nightmare picking the right product. Many incompatibilties and locking procedures! What other Schemes is Garmin going to come up with next?
5,So Great,"I love this software. Very necessary. Turn by turn is so nice. Also includes phone numbers, addresses of places. I use it so frequently. I take this everywhere I go. Love how much detail this software shows."
1,City Navigator,Never got it to work. Software may have been too large for hardware. Check with dealer or call manufacture before buying.
3,Does what it should,"This is by no means a cheap product, but it does what I need and is easy enough to use as well. My GPS would be worthless to me without this software, kinda catch you with that as the devices usually come with basically nothing as far as map and nav goes."
3,Not about Christian history,"As the previous reviewer notes, this book is about the people (six of them) whom the author feels contributed most to our understanding of the early Christian church. It is *not* about the early Christian church. So read this book if you want to find out how, for example, Hans Lietzmann belonged to the Wednesday Society local discussion group which included members of the anti-Nazi underground during WWII and of Lietzmann's concerns about what the Nazis (National Socialists) were doing to academia at that time. But this book is NOT ABOUT THE EARLY CHURCH as the cover blurb suggests. Which is perfectly OK but this fact limits the number of interested readers. I found it and bought it from where it was prominently displayed at a bookstore with other works that *were* about the early church and theology so I felt a bit misled even though I did plow through it and learn some interesting things, just not what I expected."
2,Loud!,"Oh my gosh. This hair dryer is so loud, my ears ring after using it. Also, the placement of the on/off switch is right where you grip with the tips of your fingers and you end up turning it off constantly if you hold it in the normal position."
4,Tacky Tunes,"Yes, it was fine. I wanted the album for Loving You Has Made Me Bananas. But other good tunes there too. Speedy delivery."
4,travel music,"We've used Tacky Tunes for years as our family travel music, but it was in cassette. We have newer cars with CDs. And now we have our travel music again. Tacky Tunes makes our long roadtrips seem not so long. The music and artists are so random and funny. Even the grandkids enjoy them."
1,Older is better...,"I like how this book is set up. I also like how the medical information has been updated. I was born in 1979 and my sister, in 1988. We both had a version of this book. That's why this only receives one star. The older version was much nicer, as it was not a big and bulky 3-ring binder. Also, there are a few sections that have not been changed for the better from the vesions we had.Unfortunately, while Amazon offered the older versions, they kept e-mailing saying there was a delay in the shipment. After 2-3 months of delays, I finally bought this newer version. I'm disappointed with the changes, but it's still one of the better books out there and I have it for both my children."
4,Used for generations,"The cover is a little wavy, but I love the inside contents. I wish the overall cover was more attractive."
3,Seems to expensive for what you get,"I love the information on the inside to fill in, its just like my baby book which is exactly what I was looking for. The binder that it comes in was all bend out of shape when I recieved it. Would be better with a hard binder. The pages on the inside are really just thick constuction paper which im not sure how long will hold up with it being looked at all the time."
4,Best choice available,"This is probably the best choice available for baby books. It is the same one my mother used for me although, back in those days (1945) it wasn't ring bound. The binder is a nice feature for adding pages but it would be better if the pages were sturdier...maybe some ring reinforcement.Other than that I find this book more complete that most and better for adding useful data."
1,My mother kept this baby book for me when I was a child,"My mother kept this baby book for me when I was a child. When I found out it was still in print I replaced each of my three son's baby books with this one. It is very complete and includes lots of good medical advice in the same section as the place to record the baby's information. For someone who does not journal well, this is great because it contains lots of fill-in-the-blanks.The three ring bound version is not as delightful as the one previously published by C.R. Gibson. The illustrations are very rough and I am concerned the holes in the pages will tear through. Unlike many three-ring binders, this one does not have a plastic insert to keep the pages from curling around the rings. Overall I am very disappointed with the quality of this latest version even given the ""deluxe"" cover."
3,Beauty and boredom,"There is no shortage of pretty songs on Ongiara. In fact, all of the songs are pleasant and unobtrusive at the least. My problem with this album is that it never, as a whole, sank its talons in, even after repeat listens. Compare this, for instance to the more recent self-titled album by Fleet Foxes, which I found both accessible and deep.Perhaps I just don't have the sophistication to appreciate the 'Swimmers Ongiara for what it is. I will say that the lead track, Your Rocky Spine, is one of the most brilliant and poetic love songs I have ever heard. Every time I listen to it, I cannot decide if it is a love song to a woman, borrowing imagery from the land, or the opposite. I suppose if pressed, I would cast my lot with the latter."
5,This One Caught Me Off Guard,There's a much longer review in me but I need some time to process what is already a great album. Check it out.
4,Great album by a talented group of musicians,I had never heard of Great Lakes Swimmers until listening to their set on Mountain Stage. It was a short set but I knew I had to hear more of this band. This album is richly textured and gets better with each listen. I have been listening to it several times a week since I purchased the CD and have turned several friends on to Great Lakes Swimmers as well.
2,Not quite cutting it.,"Rather bland, which was my initial reaction to the first listen. One year later -- still bland. It's too bad, I really like this band. Their self-titled debut is a must for any fan that likes Iron & Wine. So, skip this and buy self titled."
4,unsure but loving it!,I give it four stars bec ause it's still new and musically it doesn't seem as safe as the last two. They're trying new stuff and I'm not sure if the lyrics are as well thought out or if its good and I don't get it. I do know there's a lot of beautiful moments so if your a fan then you must buy it!
4,A worthy heir to Segovia,"Parkening remains one of the few classical guitarists that I enjoy listening to. Unfortunately, I have not had the joy and opportunity to see him perform live, so my impression of his artistry is relegated to recordings only.This particular recording is superb, sublime, and sweetly performed. The emotion and intensity that Parkening embodies in his playing is noted in every nuance and expression as he plays, from pianissimo to forte'. Although I am not familiar with all of the pieces on this CD, I enjoy hearing them repeatedly. It would be quite interesting to put Parkening's recordings of these pieces alongside Segovia's, to compare and contrast the Teacher with the Student to see how they differ, if at all.I would recommend this as CD as a must-have for those who like Parkening's works, but I would not recommend it for the average classical guitar enthusiast, as I think there are probably better recordings of these pieces (certainly those of Segovia's).Peace Out."
1,Parkening: Not worthy,"I don't understand why Parkening is hailed as such a brilliant artist and musician after people listen to this album, or any of his other recordings for that matter. The only reason that people admire him is because Chris has done a fantastic job of marketing himself to the degree that the public actually believes it. After hearing him play live last year, I concluded that he is one of the most insensitive, unmusical classical guitar players around today. His recordings may seem well done, yet hearing him live paints the true picture. If you love classical guitar, listen to the likes of Antigoni Goni, David Russell, Margarita Escarpa, and Roland Dyens."
5,Excellent --Dark Ambient at its best!,"Admittedly, ""Below Zero"" will not be for everyone. It is Dark Ambient at its best--if you enjoyed Steve Roach's ""The Magnificent Void,"" you will probably love ""Below Zero""--if not, stay away. It is the sort of music to which you must really listen--you can't be babbling away to yourself and hear the moments between the moments. It is a departure from Rich's recent more lyrical efforts like ""Seven Veils,"" ""Fissures,"" & ""Yearning."" Here, Rich revisits his roots (""Trances & Drones"") and then goes well beyond. There is not one weak track on the album."
3,A dark voyage into the restless side of the unknown,"Below zero is a CD which consists of six selections that were previously issued on various compilation CD's with the exception of track 2. Below zero is a departure from Robert's more recent projects. Below zero explores the dark and mysterious side of Robert's music. This CD is reminiscent of Trances/ Drones, however the selections on this CD create an ominous aural soundscape that may be uncomfortable for some. Fans of Dark Ambient music should relish the dark nature of this CD, while Robert's mainstream fans may be alienated by the morose content of this CD. Below Zero is not intended for everyone. It would be prudent to sample this CD before adding this CD to your Robert Rich collection."
5,Call him Master,"Excellent 'deep space' from Robert;not quite as amazing as Inner Landscapes, imo,but a worthy companion to that album.If you have Trances/Drones, Numena, Humidityetc, then you need this one too.Pranams, Mr. Rich!"
2,Dull disappointment,"As much of a Robert Rich fan that I am, I have to agree with what the other reviewers have to say. This collection is far too homogenous. While these soundscape pieces are vaguely reminscent of Robert's early work on ""Trances & Drones"", most of these tracks are indistinguishable from one another and become quite grating after 20 minutes, particularly the middle tracks (2-4). The lengthy first track has its moments and succeeds in capturing the feeling of deep outer space. ""Liquid Air"" is the really the standout track (and also appears on the ""From Here to Tranquility Vol. 1"" compilation). ""Requiem"" is also decent, but not quite on par with what Robert is capable of. This one is for Robert Rich completists only."
5,Great show,We love to watch this show and we loved watching these movies too. Everyone always wants to borrow them from us.
1,They shipped me a knock-off brand,"I thought I was ordering this from Amazon. I was frustrated to see my order farmed out to a 3rd party. This should be made VERY obvious when I place an order. Watch out for the phrase ""Offered by:"" in the item description when ordering parts from Amazon. That means you aren't buying the part from Amazon but from a 3rd party instead.The product I received was not what I ordered. I ordered a Motorola cable but received a no name knock-off instead!You are damaging Amazon's reputation by using this 3rd party selling technique."
2,Not as polished as I had hoped,"Having had years of latin in a seminary as well as years of singing gregorian chant and high and low masses in latin, I was a bit disappointed in the product.There are CD's out there from monasteries that offer better renditions and some of the masses written by the classical composers are more true to form. I got the impression that this CD was more intended to take one down ""memory lane"" than truly recreate and represent a Catholic High Mass. No nostalgia for me with this CD. If you want some great traditional Catolic hyms, I highly recommend the CD entitled ""Catholic Latin Classics"""
4,Great Training Aid (and Enjoyable to boot!),"Now that there is a Tridentine mass being offered in Knoxville, this CD becomes more valuable than ever. Not only does listening to the Mass provide a serene inspiration, but it serves as instruction to us Post-Vatican II catholics who are only familiar with the Novus Ordo liturgy. Et cum spiritu tuo!I am much more comfortable in partipating in the prayer of the mass in latin after repeated listening to this CD. As a bonus, the Ave Maria is wonderful, as is the chanted Pater Noster.Incidentally, the CD Abba Pater features an excellent track featuring the late John Paul II chanting the same Pater Noster, followed by a male choir praying it again, wonderfully orchestrated. I highly recommend this CD as well."
4,"good, but could have been better.","A great sampler of the Tridentine mass, but does not carry the sense of sanctity that is its attribute. Should have had more gregorian chants and saced polyphony.....THAT I would call a great tridentine mass!"
5,Beautiful illustrations,"This is a very sweet children's book with beautiful, vivid & detailed illustrations. The cat is so life-like, it could almost walk out of the book. It is fun to read a book written about Christmas from a cat's perspective. It is simple & innocent, but also engaging."
3,cute idea,"I just HAD to have this book when I saw it - the kitty on the cover looks very much like my very own sweet pussycat!The pictures are beautiful.I am criticizing more from an adult standpoint - the words that were used sometimes didn't flow together that well - and the PussyCat's Christmas ends on Christmas Eve.That's just my 2 cents... Is sure it cute, though!"
5,Pussycat's Christmas,I loved this author when I was a kid; bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter who loved it.
1,Difficult eyeliner color to find but awful product,"I am very disappointed with this product and really regret putting my money into it, and it is expensive for my budget. Color more like watercolor than anything else, get in the eyes and burn if you don't wait for it to dry and FLAKES a lot. Never seen an eyeliner flaking that much. Get all over my face and in my eyes, which is a disaster if you wear contacts like I do. I really do not recommend it."
5,"A Tribute, Not a Review","I studied with Robert Lowell at Harvard in 1963 & 1964. I wouldn't presume to review his Collected Poems, only to testify that he was a giant of a human -- witty, sensitive even toward brash young would-be poets, immensely knowledgeable, immensely conscientious. Having known him remains one of the great privileges of my life. Reading his poems is a great privilege for all of us."
5,The XBX Plan makes you feel great all day from day one.,"This exercise plan really is easier done than said. You can feel the benefit from day one, and you never get sore."
4,"Absolutely wonderful, Totaly cool book!","This is one of my all time favorite books. You won't be able to take your eyes off it. Magic, adventure, this book has it all!"
1,Review,"I never received the product, was not contact that it was lost in the mail until I contacted the owner and it could not be replaced. Was offered a refund though."
5,This book really drops the gas pedal!,"I have not seen a collection of autos quite as remarkable as this, and I've seen many autos. The auto is a beautiful thing, and these autos are second to none. Bravo, autos!"
5,Great figure!,"I got this figure for christmas. I previously got the Roto Legolas figure and was very pleased. Now I am also very happy with this figure! It has such great quality and likeness. He looks exactly like Aragorn, even has the evenstar! He has his sword and his dagger with him,ready for battle! These rotocast figures are so much better than the 12 inch collectors series. I hope they make a ton more of these rotocast figures! Thanks for reading my review"
2,Noisy but attractive,"Even though these shoes have an elegantly simplistic, yet contemporary style, the loud sound that the fairly hard plastic heel makes as you walk is an annoying feature. The padding of the sole could also be a little more ample, so if you decide these shoes will suit your needs, you might consider additional orthotics to increase your comfort."
2,Wish I would have paid attention,"Vanity! Nude! Bizarre story! Sounds perfect! What more could one want? How about a decent transfer to DVD?! Had I been paying attention, I would have noticed this DVD was released by Jef Films, which is known for its shoddy and cheap quality. I have other DVDs from Jef Films, which I purchased because those films are available only from that company, and the quality is just as bad. It appears they transfer these films from old VHS copies, which renders the video quality nearly impossible to watch. It is painfully obvious the company is only interested in making money and doesn't care at all about issuing a quality product. Vanity: 5/5 stars; the movie itself: 2.5/5 stars, the DVD: 1/5 stars."
2,coming clean,"Playboy asks why this movie hasn't become a cult classic. I'll tell you.First of all, the painting on the cover does not look like the actual woman in the film. One or two of the reviewers liked the way she looks. Okay, to each his own, but don't be surprised if you find her unattractive.Second, the nudity. No, she is NOT nude all the time. Nor half the time. Nor a fourth of the time. Nor... She's nude a few seconds now and then. No more than any other movie.Third, the movie is only 79 minutes, and the first four of them are skippable.The movie is mostly a man fighting with a Neanderthal survivor. Both behave more childishly than primitively. You'll see more convincing behavior in Clan of the Cave Bear.There are NO explicit sex scenes. Also, no effective sex scenes of any kind. Even the fight scenes are disappointing.Oh, and did I mention that the dialogue is a joke?Bottom line: for almost every viewer, this movie will not be worth watching even once."
2,A young Vanity - nude - weird movie,"This is a very bizarre movie. Some Ape creature becomes friends with Vanity on an island where only she and her lover are. Her lover becomes jealous and then later the Ape creature and he battle over Vanity. Appears to be a dream. Vanity is cute and nude in the movie, but she hardly looks like herself. Very odd movie, if you are looking for Vanity nude, you are better off getting a copy of 52 pickup a better movie or Action Jackson. She shows skin in both. Here she does have a full frontal scene, but it is not all that long anyway."
2,Yawn.,"I saw this film years ago on a crappy videotape, so before writing my review I decided to give the DVD a chance and you know what? The picture quality on the DVD isn't much better (if any) than the videotape and the story still sucks. Yea, Vanity gets naked but it's done in such an unsexy way that it's well unsexy. She looked sexier with clothes on in THE LAST DRAGON.The story if you can call it that is about Vanity pining for her ex-boyfriend, one night she falls asleep and has an 80-minute dream about them living on a tropical island together. Soon she finds a freaky looking gorilla and starts a relationship with him. The boyfriend is jealous and a war breaks out between the two, the gorilla and the man that is, with each kidnapping the girl away from the other and raping her."
2,Tanyas Island,I was not real happy with the video quality of the movie. I have it on VHS and the picture quality looked just like the the VHS tape and not DVD quality. It was a little disappointing. But I liked the movie that is why I was trying to get it on DVD.
2,Not Even...,"I went into this thinking I would see heaping helping of D D Winters and what I got was a pitiful movie that I feel cost too much and was absolute nonsense. Yes your watching this because of the main actress let's not misconstrue the basics but all in all the movie was a poor wannabe black emmanuelle rip off about a women that fantasizes about a ape and getting raped by a insecure jack ass of a man who should be thankful a women so beautiful as she to give him the time of day.Yes she is naked a couple of times, yes her body is ridiculous(the type of body that type of guy couldn't apreciate) and yes she is beautiful, but the story sucks and I don't know the message this dumb ass french director is trying to convey. I wouldn't have bought it and paid $9.99 for it. Keep your money and rent it somewhere other wise I wouldn't have given it 2 stars if not for the nudity. Sucks!"
2,"Tarzan, Jane, monkey - sort of","Since another reviewer already posted the spoiler (thanks moron), I'll just focus, ahem, on the film. Girl and boy in not the most healthy relationship (there is some dishware smashing) find themselves on a tropical island. She spends a lot of time naked. He does who knows what. Hey! It's Tanya's island, sheesh!Somehow they manage to carry a huge tent, accessories, pots and pans, the whole nine yards, and set up camp on a beach near a jungle. Nakedness ensues. Girl meets Gorilla. Girl becomes infatuated with gorilla. Boy becomes jealous. Boy builds fort with a cage, keeps girl in cage. Okay, rewind. He builds a fort? Sure. All it takes is a bit of bamboo and a machete - oh and, in the real world, a month or two.Anyway, boy steals girl from gorilla, gorilla steals girl back from boy, gorilla is, er, not so nice after all ...Dumb movie, but worth it if you like flat-chested chicks frolicking about."
1,no redeeming value,anyone with an IQ over 40 and an old 8 mm camera could have done better. Nothing Nothing Nothing Nothing
1,BIG MISTAKE!,"THE ""MOVIE"" WASN'T WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE - HAVE A BASIC PLOT AND MAKE SOME SENSE. VANITY IS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN - SHE WAS EXPLOITED IN THIS ""MOVIE"". I WATCHED ABOUT HALF OF THE ""MOVIE"", TOOK IT OUT OF THE DVD PLAYER. SINCE I COULD NOT RETURN IT, I GAVE IT AWAY."
4,Jumping fun from 1983!,"1983 release from Joe King Carrasco and the Crowns - is it Dance? Ska? Tex/Mex? All of the above. Put it on when you throw an eighties party! Tracks are - LET'S GO, DANCE REPUBLIC, KANTINA, GET OFF, BUENA, TEARS BEEN A-FALLING, PARTY WEEKEND, LET'S GO NUTZ, LUPE, PERFECT SPOT, BURNIN' IT DOWN, GRACIAS."
3,New It All Along,"Mr. Stang was always one of my favorite authors/commentators. He had the courage to tell it like it is. And in this book, written many years ago, he spells out the truth. In todays America it is blatantly clear that the communist party was and is behind the Civil Rights Movement then and the Civil Justice Movement now. We ignore this at the peril of our nation. Ignorance is not only bliss, it is often cataclysmaly destructive."
5,A Feel-Good Romantic Comedy,"This charming, witty tale stars great acting (Michael Douglas, Annette Bening) with a great supporting cast (Martin Sheen, Michael J. Fox, David Paymer). The laughter keeps coming in a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (""A Few Good Men""), and evaluates the main carachters' morals in a liberal fashion. ""The American President"" leaves the audience with a feel-good, patriotic smile across its face."
5,This is a defnite feel good movie,"This is really an excellent film. It has some funny moments and is a very well written story, albeit very idealistic. The supporting cast is excellent, notably Michael J Fox, Martin Sheen and David Paymer. Michael Douglas and Annette Bening fit well as a couple and Rob Reiner did an excellent directing job. I thought the opening credits were good too (excellent music, panorama of real former Presidents)"
4,DPollard,I love this movie. Regardless of your politics this does provide some insight into the political process. Plus it is a great love story.
3,NICE AND ROMANTIC MOVIE,"I ENJOY WATCHING MICHAEL DOUGLAS AND ANNETTE BENNING. THIS IS AN INTERESTING MOVIE, I LIKE ANNETTE IN THIS MOVIE. SHE HAS CHARECTER AND A STRONG FORM IN THIS FILM. OTHER THAN MICHAEL, HE KIND A MAKES A LITTLE OF A JOKE WHAT A PRESINDENT SHOULD DO WHEN UNDER ATTACK.BUT IS A ROMANTIC FILM AND MAYBE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IT THAT WAY, EVEN THOUGH IS INTERESTING IS NICE TO SEE THEM BOTH."
3,"The movie is great, DVD quality is lacking","I purchased this DVD for my mother, as this is one of her favourite movies. The movie itself is excellent, but the DVD quality is horrible. I do not understand why it looks so incredibly bad, and is letterboxed to such a serious extent. This movie has been on HD cable before and does not suffer any of these problems, so I cannot understand why the DVDs look this bad. It is a very big disappointment."
3,Good Movie - Horrible DVD,"This is a good movie, but DO NOT order the DVD. I have over 100 DVD's and this is by far the worst transfer I have ever seen. It will almost hurt your eyes by the end of the film from all the artifacts and harsh jagged lines."
1,Amazon still pushing the 7 year old Snapper!,"This was advertised as a keep case & was supposed to have a new anamorphic transfer. Unfortunately they replaced ""keep case"" with the Mother's Day card promo & everyone is receiving the 7 year old non-anamorphic snappers. Prepare for a lot of returns Amazon as you couldn't put enough lipstick on this pig to sell it."
1,Removed this item from my wishlist,Removed this item from my wishlist as it was a FullScreen format (1.33:1 confused me a bit)
5,great movie of micheal,just had to replace the one i own i wanted in full screen but they sent it in wide screen format only if i wanted in wide screen format i would of got it at the lesser price but they mess up on the order thanks bill
2,Not a bad movie if you can overlook the politics,"There are some good lines in this movie and the acting is better than most. Unfortunately, the liberal slant of this movie tends to pull it down several notches.I think Michael Douglas did a good job in his role as the President. The writers went a bit overboard with their portrayal of the ""evil"" Republican (Richard Dreyfuss).Overall, it's a good drama/comedy. The speech that Michael Douglas makes at the end is a classic leftie diatribe...the other guys are all about symbolism, but I'm going to really do something about crime by getting assault weapons and hanguns off the street. What a bunch of hogwash."
5,The American President,One of my favorite movies I have been waiting for on Blu Ray. Great movie - great transfer to Blu Ray!!
5,Love this movie!,"This is one of my favorite movies! I call it a ""feel good"" movie because it makes me smile! :)"
5,The American President,I ordered this with other videos and received it within the next week. I was very pleased and would order again.
3,No audio commentary?,"Great movie, but I am very disappointed in the DVD version. Why is there no audio commentary? This is a Rob Reiner film. He usually does commentaries for his other movies, so I was expecting one for this. What a huge missed opportunity."
3,chic flick,wife liked. i tolerated. casual entertainment. she made me buy it so she stimulated the economy. and i am tired of writing
1,Liberal Garbage,"The acting by all concerned is superb. The storyline however, is blatant liberal garbage, such as the president (Michael Douglas) proclaiming that the ACLU is an organization dedicated to defending the Bill of Rights, please, how sick can this get. But, what can one expect from the wackiest of liberal fanatics, director Rob Reiner, and a cast of Hollywood left wing nuts like Martin Sheen and super wacko-liberal Warren Beatty's wife, to name a couple. Liberals will salivate and eat it up, but conservatives should consider this as nothing more than Hollywood's ongoing promotion of liberal propaganda, a-la ""The Day After Tomorrow"". Yuk !!"
1,"First 30m are great, then propaganda","First 30 minutes are great. Then the liberal propaganda starts, and never stops.For those of you who will comment about me and others being paranoid etc, etc, I have a question for you: Can you name any movie or tv show in the past thirty years where the good guy was a conservative Republican and the bad guy was a liberal democrat? No, I don't think you can. Every movie or television show the last fifty years involving politics has the Republican being a mean, evil guy. And the democrat is the supposed role model for the nation. This goes all the way back to ""Seven Days in May"" in the 60's, up through ""The West Wing"" and on into today's releases. (The only exception I can think of is ""24"".) It's all really predictable and boring, which describes American President in a nutshell."
1,If you like burning USA flags...,If you like burning flags and don't think citizens have the right to bear arms then you will love this movie.
1,nope,"Bought it for a friend, not my type of movie. i prefer uplifting family Christian movies, only got this because a friend wanted it. I never watched it."
4,Michael Douglas,Michael Douglas is one of my favorite actors.I enjoyed this fun romance movie.Douglas is President of US.I will purchase more Douglas DVD's.
4,Funny politics,"The plot has been posted elsewhere, so I won't repeat it.What I find humorous (besides the movie) are the comments about it being ""too"" political, or having a ""leftist/liberal/(fill in the blank)"" viewpoint. Any movie set in the White House involving presidential activities will have to have some viewpoint. Not even documentaries are unbiased. The fact that ""gun control"" and an ""environment"" bill are two of the issues seems logical from a director who got a fifty-cent tax put on cigarette sales.Back to the movie. Funny and well-acted by all. Highly recommended. I seem to like Rob Reiner movies (Spinal Tap, When Harry Met Sally, Princess Bride, Misery, A Few Good Men, Stand By Me, The Sure Thing). DVD has minimal extras. Sound and picture were OK on my copy.I am a fan, and this is my review."
3,The American President,The American President is an excellent movie. Unfortunately the processing of this movie into DVD is in my opinion pretty poor. The audio is OK but the video has several noisy scenes and some which are virtually unwatchable. I honestly think that the VHS tape is easier to watch. I hope that the studio takes this hint and reprocesses this classic movie into something which someone will want to collect. I'm sending my copy back for a refund.
4,If Only,"I've watched this movie so many times it almost seems silly, BUT, the thing that keeps coming back to me is how much I wish we had a President who had the moral character that Andrew Shephard has. The movie makes you want to go out and vote for Michael Douglas. Here's a man who fights for his beliefs and stands up for what he believes, which by the end of the movie, you do too. Would somebody please nominate this man for President? Please!"
3,Good Movie - Bad DVD,"The movie itself is good and worth seeing. As has been mentioned by some other reviewers, the DVD quality is terrible. First, it is letter-boxed, which means if you have a wide screen TV you will have about 2/3 black screen with a little tiny movie in the middle. Second, the DVD transfer is terrible. There are all sorts of very visible artifacts throughout the entire movie, and they are very distracting. In sum, 5 stars for the movie, and 1 star for the quality of the DVD."
3,The American President (DVD),Great movie but transfer from VHS to DVD is poor. Movie is out of focus and general recording quality is lacking.
5,One of the best ever,"The American President is a perfect romantic comedy because instead of being inane, it is intelligent, witty and thoughtful, and the story is populated by intelligent, witty, thoughtful characters. One of my favorite movies of all time."
4,"The blueprint for ""The West Wing""","Almost everything that makes ""The American President"" compulsively watchable is due to the screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, who literally used this movie as the blueprint for ""The West Wing"", his first-rate television series. Rob Reiner slows down Sorkin's staccato pace enough for the saccharine Douglas-Bening love story to sound like a thinking man's Meg Ryan movie: sometimes you feel the actors are moving underwater in the White House corridors. They do fine, but it's really the proto-""West Wing"" aspect that's the most fun. Especially amusing are discovering the characters who will reappear, with barely a change, in TWW. Spot Michael J. Fox in the ""Josh Lyman"" part, David Paymer in the ""Toby Ziegler"" part, and Martin Sheen trying out his paces in the ""Leo McGarry"" chief of staff part. Michael Douglas is okay, but I was really hankering to see Sheen behind the desk in the Oval Office, and Bening, who's excellent, has both C.J.'s and Donna's lines."
2,Great movie--Terrible video transfer!,"This, hands down, is the worst transfer to video I've ever seen. I have a Progressive scan DVD player with Monster component cables hooked up to a Sony HDTV and the transfer of this video is worse than watching it on my ten year old VCR. What a shame for a thoroughly enjoyable film."
2,Just Average...,"I found this film to be just average. The story is nice, but a little unbelievable and very predictable. These films are usually my type, but for some reason, this one didn't do anything for me."
5,The most wonderful movie,"I watch this movie when I feel tired and with stress. It is refreshing and leaves the viewer thinking that falling in love is possible and wonderful. Yes, I really love this movie."
3,Rob the director missed a great opportunity...,"While this is an enjoyable, successful political/romantic comedy as is, it could have been much deeper and richer. Rob Reiner could have made either the president or the female lobbyist a strong conservative, and the film would have benefitted greatly from the clash between political philosophy and sexual attraction. Instead, he took the easy but duller path of having Michael Douglas's president and Annette Benning's lobbyist both lean toward the liberal side. The conservative politicians are the bad guys, of course. I am a moderate Democrat myself, but I would have liked to see a less predictable script."
1,Perfect Filmmaking Deserves a Far Better Transfer,"I'm confident the Blu-Ray release, whenever it comes, will be cleaned up and, most importantly, anamorphic. This disc is embarrasing.iTunes offers an anamorphic transfer to purchase for the same price, and the picture quality is really good too. Save your money. Save your time. Check out iTunes and watch it tonight.In the meantime, I'll keep waiting for the BD."
2,"Fine actors, poor movie","All these actors have distinguished themselves in many other roles and Sorkin has written some great tv (West Wing, anyone?), which is why it is sad to say that this is a poor film. Some good lines of dialogue cannot cover the preposterousness of the story, with a president too liberal for conservatives and sometimes too conservative for liberals!! It swerves too much and really only gets going in the last five minutes. In fact, it ends JUST as it was about to get really freakin' interesting!!"
3,"Great movie, terrible DVD","I love this movie and was excited to check out the DVD. What a disaster! The picture quality is decidedly poor and there are absolutely no extras. I hate to say it, but don't buy this one."
5,impossible! ! !,"it would most certainly take more than a one liner to review this wonderful movie. I am 75 and this takes me back to a few centuries ago when they made movies that you wish you could never forget and I haven't. This movie you cpould happily take home with you and not want to throw-up!!!I wish I could shake rob reiner's hand for reminding me of what entertainment was. Most of the movies they try,{repeat try} to make have been dredged up from the sewer. You don't have any tallent to make the movies now and it happens THEY DON'T! ! ! thank you for allowimng me to talk about this one rose in in a briar patch. I am scotty winter from Stilwell, ok. Most call me ""TIGGER""scotty tigger@intellex.com"
3,Good but Unrealstic,"The performances carry this one. Douglas is very good (as usual), Bening is very sympathetic and Sheen, for once, isn't melodramatic. The film would have been better without the strong liberal themes. The problem isn't that the characters are liberal. The problem is that their liberalism is presented in such a sanctimonious manner that it often feels as if the filmmakers are ridiculing you if you disagree with their views. Also, any president foolish enough to make that impromptu speech to the press would deserve the pounding he/she would definitely take in the next election. Being so outspoken on any highly volatile political issue, such as guns or abortion, is (unfortunately) very unrealistic and unbelievable for a national politician of either party."
2,Hollywood and Political Movies,"Other than an interesting performance from Douglas, this movie is bland, predictable, and follows the typical Hollywood agenda for a political movie. I'm ready to see a movie espousing pro-life rhetoric just so I can hear and see something different out of Hollywood.Overall, this movie just didn't push any buttons for me except I thought Douglas was interesting in a low key role which he hardly ever plays."
2,"2008 ""reissue"" is the old DVD in a new package","Buyer beware: the 2008 ""reissue"" of The American President is simply the original DVD release in a new clamshell case. Although the new package describes this release as anamorphic (implying a new and hopefully better transfer than the awful original DVD release) it is not. You'll get the same, poor quality original release DVD. It IS widescreen, but in 4x3 letterbox format with a lot of artifacts. The movie is great, a real charmer, but it's hard to watch with such low picture quality. WHV has announced a Blu-Ray release of the film in late 2012, but I've seen nothing about a good quality DVD release to come. Four stars for the movie plus zero stars for the picture quality & misleading info about the transfer averages out to two stars. Skip this release."
1,The American President,"Great movie, excellent acting! Annette Benning is priceless as the love interest in this film about a widower in the White House. He seeks a relationaship with an environmental lobbyist, of all things, and though their relationship is open and above board, the politicians use it against the incumbent during his run for reelection. Politics are ugly, but truth prevails in this optimistic movie. My husband and I love this one and we have watched it many times. We always love the ending because we enjoy love winning and truth being stronger than bad politics. Easily one of my favorites."
1,Good movie. Horrendous DVD transfer - AVOID!,"This is a charming film with good performances. It reads like a precursor to Aaron Sorkin's ""West Wing,"" except Martin Sheen is the best friend in this one. Michael Douglas is president.HOWEVER, the DVD transfer on this disc is fairly notorious on DVD review sites as being one of the worst ever created. You would be doing yourself a disservice by buying this disc. Get the VHS tape or wait for a new edition on DVD."
4,good film,i really enjoyed this film.haven't been able to say that much about Michael Douglas films of late because he is always the victim but the Chemistry with Annette Bening is solid.Michael J.Fox is alright.a good film.
3,"Good Acting, Funny Script, But Pretentious Politics","The title says it all. I like Michael Douglas, and his delivery is often pitch perfect. He plays the President well. Holding me back from a four star rating is the sanctimonious politics involved here; a significant plot device revolves around two pieces of legislation: one to cut carbon dioxide emissions by a drastic 20%, and the other called a ""crime bill"" to outlaw the possession of handguns. The characters all speak very highly of this legislation, with the implication that anyone who disagrees with these policies is doing nothing more than playing to simpletons."
5,"If You go crazy over Kyuss,you'll love this one...","As they ARE the single most unappreciated band ever to walk to earth, it's hard to find neat old recordings of their music, especially B-Sides and live stuff. This CD has both!!! It's a great buy for those who fell in love with Sky Valley, Blues For the Red Sun, and ...And the Circus Leaves Town. GET IT NOW AND BE HAPPY!!!"
4,Muchas Gracias indeed,"Although Kyuss may not be best represented by the tracks on this album, you cant deny the tracks are great. Owning the three most common Kyuss albums (Blues/Sky Valley/Circus), I was attracted to the several songs on the album that I was blissfully unaware of before. If Kyuss is hard to get hold of for you then this album is a good way to find some rarer songs. The live tracks too deserve a special mention. The recordings are good quality high energy versions and there is a totally ripped recording of freedom run including Josh's insane guitar effects. In summary an album well worth having for the Kyuss listener with an interest in finding rarer songs."
2,How can a six hundred page novel survive in the marketplace,"of ideas without any ideas? The writing is laborious, the characters are simplistic stereotypes, the plot reeks of deus ex machina, or shall I say David Wingrove ex machina since I believe this ""novel"" to be the result of a writing group/therapy session that Mr. Wingrove was deluded into thinking had literary merit. Its O.K. to be in love with yourself, just don't ask me to subsidize you. My hands feel sticky after reading it. Yuck."
5,"Can't give enough praise to this series, fantastic.","I pretty much said it all in the title, or people have said it before me, so I won't go on about it. However, if you like epic science fiction, read these books. They are simply incredible."
3,"Boy, Epic is right!","The professional reviewers who fawned over Chung Kuo speak of combinations of Clavell,Herbert,and Star Wars. They left out Stephen King. As in an exhuasting narrative. Well written, yes. thought provoking, yes. But the charactors kept streaming at you. If there were any who I really took to, I might consider reading the next volume. But, it was too wide in scope. Too many plots. Then,it bascially finishes with an old fashioned shoot it up. I can't see investing the time for the rest of the series. Wingrove is obviously a very good writer, but he spreads himself too thin, as if he had too much to say."
3,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","Chung Kuo has quite a few faults, indeed. It is violent and graphic in a few places and there is quite a bit of death, language, and explicit sexual themes throughout. Don't expect an incredibly complex set of characters, or beautiful or gripping descriptions.Still I COULD NOT put this book down. Not that it was so good. But the world it purports is almost believable, and it is fairly gripping.It's more or less worth slogging through, but BE WARNED: there are scenes in it, as well as its sequel ""The Broken Wheel"" (I haven't read any of the ones following) that still nauseate me when I think of them almost a year later (they're that sick).Good but not great. There's way better sci-fi/fantasy books in this vein out there - but if you want depressed, crumbling, revolution, etc, go with Chung Kuo."
2,"Addictive, but....","This, the first in David Wingrove's epic series about a future in which Chinese culture has become dominant, is plotted well enough to keep you reading. That's on the plus side. The minuses include a sexist and racist point of view, even taking into account that Wingrove has portrayed a dystopia. The women are portrayed as subservient or manipulative, and racial differences are stereotyped. There is ample opportunity for character development over the course of this long book and its successors, and yet most of the characters are little more than cardboard cut-outs. Dialog is stilted. In spite of all this, I keep reading, hoping that there will be redemption in the end. The books are addictive, but be forewarned."
1,NOT Sci-Fi. Rather it is hard-core Political Fantasy-Porn.,"NOT Sci-Fi. Rather it is hard-core Political Fantasy-Porn.Seriously, I was not expecting this.Its one thing to write about an alternate possibility of the world and to present it in a science-fiction or a fantasy story. But this is not it.I was NOT expecting to read detailed hardcore violating porn in the middle of these stories. The first incident completely ambushed me, and I didn't bother to continue to read to see if there was a second.The book went in the trash.I'm sure there are better authors who can tell an interesting alternate political story of the world, with stooping to what this author does.I mean come on, Stephen Kings novels are part Science-Fiction too, but they are put in the Horror section. This should have been in the Porn section of the bookstore."
2,trashy,"I've read a few books of this series. They're somewhat engrossing, but in a trashy way. Yuck, yuck, I feel dirty now."
1,A Terrible Disappointment,"This book was one of the worst science-fiction novels I have read in years. The characters were totally unbelievable and the entire book lacked any sort of rising action or believable plot. If you want epic sci-fi, read the Dune series, if you want Asian intrigue, pick up Shogun or Noble House, but don't waste your time with Chung Kuo."
1,"A boring racist, sexist trash disguised as a sci-fi novel","David Wingrove uses the premise of a China-dominated future to fill this book with unsavory characters and NO heroes or heroines. Almost all female characters are professional prostitutes. Most white male characters are nazi-type fascists, and Asian characters are continuously-bowing stereotypes from the middle ages. Most characters are despicable and are always getting killed off, and as the reader you don't care about their (always) violent and bloody deaths. Don't waste your money and time on this series."
4,I liked it better 15 years ago,"I read the Chung Kuo series a long time ago and thought they were great, but I lost them during a cross-country move a few years ago. When I found the first two books on Amazon, I got excited and started reading them again. I guess my standards have changed because I found the writing self-absorbed this time around. There were long meanderings that hammered certain plot points to death and then there was the overuse of some words like ""shiver."" Warning, there are graphic scenes of sex and brutality that effectively illustrate the culture, but could have made the point with less excruciating detail. Yet . . . the plot continues to enthrall. The futuristic setting of a restored Chinese Empire that now rules the entire earth is gripping, and the characters are deep and well-drawn, like living people. Now that I'm grown up, yeah, I'm still reading them, but I'll be skimming through some passages."
4,"Engrossing, imaginative--why the obsession with rape/torture","If you find yourself saying, ""I love good, imagitive science fiction, but most contemporary authors just don't mix sex and torture enough for me,"" then this is the book for you. Personally, I like my sex WITHOUT the torture and rape, so I found some passages unreadable. It seems like there have to be better ways to make the whole ""bad people--good ideas"" dichotomy clear. Still, I keep reading, so who am I to criticize? However, as I get further into the series and more and more of the characters through whose eyes I saw the action are killed, I have less and less incentive to keep reading."
4,"""I Shouldn't Feel This Way""","In Christian evangelical circles where women are given little permission to express negative emotions, ""The Facts about Your Feelings"" can help women understand the purpose of emotions. Even though it is an introductory book, the content can help heal the conflicts of women who struggle with feelings they ""shouldn't"" have. The book covers self-esteem, anger, depression, true and false guilt, and fear, after laying the foundation that emotional health is possible in Christ. While the book does not come with study questions, it would work well in groups.(This review was previously published in ""Daughters of Sarah"" Nov/Dec 1985.)"
1,What a deciet!,"TOTAL LACK OF QUALITY CONTROL ON THIS PRODUCT.I'd estimate that 20% of the test questions have mistakes - either typographical mistakes, questions that just make sense, but worst of all, so many questions HAVE WRONG ANSWERS given.When the ""reference"" link is clicked, you are taken to THE VERY START a .pdf file that has NO index, NO Table of contents and NO pdf tags. You are left with no indication of how to find the reference other than to use the ""find"" function. And even then, so many times there is no reference related to the question you are having ifficulty with... The real pity is that the books that this product is based on are good books, so if you do eventually find the correct reference in the .pdf file, you can usually get some good information. But this is not what you buy - you are buying a training kit - and it should NEVER have got passed quality control."
1,Very Disappointing!,"I Never expected anything like this from Cisco! The Books for CCNP are great but this Training kit is far from being a reasonable product! The Learning Mode is OK, but for the incorrect answers you have to dig yourself for the explanation thru the link they provide, which is painful. It would be great if the explanation is right there for you like most of the selftest software on the market. It would score on time saving and less pain on neck!The exam mode is the worst feature of this product. You don't have the option to choose an indivual exam mode. This feature is annoying since you must accept to test for all the subjects weather you're going to take a single exam or Not. GREAT!I don't recommend anyone to spend this much money on the product. Buy a selftest software that provides an answer and explanation, and you'll be glad you did!!!"
4,Simple and to the point.,"This was a useful book that didn't go too far and beyond the basics of the AP English test. The test taking tips were ones that I never heard from my teacher and they made a lot of sense. I improved my multiple chocie score considerably by following the system in this book. As for the essay portion I'm not sure if this book, or any book, can help with any more than structure and grammer. You need to know how to write the AP essays on your own. This book can help you boost your essay scores, NOT teach you how to write one (it says that right in the book).Overall, it was VERY helpful, and I would recomend getting it at least a month ahead of time, if not more. ---afterthought-I wish I had got the book at like 2 months before, I was disappointed I only got a 3 :("
1,HORRIBLE,"I am an AP english student, and used this book, it is pointless. It is full of jokes and meaningless BS that doesnt help. I would recommend the CliffNotes AP Prep GUide. Even though the CliffNotes are not good for most APs, it is great for the AP English Exam. I definetly know that the Cliffs got me a 4. While taking the test, I literally used nothing from the Princeton Review book, the Cliffs helped the most."
5,Pretty good!,"These CD's are very reliable and also very easy to write and print on. After 25-ish CDs, I've never had one fail to write, which is excellent so far. Additionally, the surface is completely blank white and pens stick to it pretty well, allowing me to illustrate a bit on my CD's or print on them using my printer. CDs may be fading out of use, but these are a good choice if you're still in the market for em."
1,I've never had worse CD-Rs,"After six straight coasters and no successfully written cds, I cannot say I've ever, from any brand, either cheap or expensive, had this many bad discs in a package. Not only do they not burn cleanly, but they've put some kind of extra layer of printable surface on the discs, making them large enough to get stuck in car cd players (or really, any slot-loading cd player, they're fine in tray loaders). I had to wedge the last one out carefully with a key. These are awful CD-Rs, I can't believe there's so many positive reviews. I'm guessing they're written by people who sell them / make them, I hate when that happens.Stay FAR away from this garbage."
1,Ritek Ridata are made in China,"Should know better, but after reading the revuesI ordered 3 packs of this product. Many defective discs.10% or more so far......My advice- stay away...It was waste of money and TIME."
3,packing material? wha?,"The CDRs themselves are great,I used to purchase them through another company so I know of their quality, but this seller refuses to use packing material !!!. The first time I ordered from them the package came with 2 of the shrink wrapped bunches of 50 CDRs cracked open and hopelessly scratched. I sent it back , got refunded and called customer service and was told that I was assured the next package would be perfect but NO! EXACT SAME SHIPPING METHOD!!! same 4 bundles of 50 NO PACKING MATERIAL and 2 of the 4 bundles cracked open. I AINT GOT TIME FOR THIS so I grinned and beared it only 10 CDRs were damaged this time. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM PEOPLE?"
3,"Packaging bad for West coast to East coast!, This is a very good Blank CD disc other than the packaging!","I only gave three stars because shrink wrap is always busted when I order it.I have used this brand for last year and no Floaters!Yes!, I would recommend this Brand to a Friend (would also mention bad packaging)"
2,White Top No Good,"The quality of the disc is fine as far as musical quality is concerned. The ink or whatever it is that makes up the white top, however, gets stuck in a lot of car stereos. This freaked me out the first time it did it. It does eject but takes a few tries.In computers and dvd players, etc with pop out trays this will be fine, but if you plan on using them in car stereos with the felt lips/opening, I would reconsider this purchase."
4,Does...,...the job. I mean there's not a whole lot you can say about CD-Rs. They were inexpensive and you can write to the top of them with a CD printable printer...
1,Way overpriced and smells terrible,"I just got out of the shower after using this hair mask. From the very beginning, the scent stung my nostrils, I expected a well-established brand such as Kerastase to smell much better. While the product did make my hair slightly softer, the effect is not much different than using a $3 Pantene conditioner. Overall totally not worth the price. If you look at the ingredients, the main ones were water, cetearyl alcohol, and glycerin, the primary ingredients of cheap soap. I'm turning to something more natural. If you're looking for a good natural hair mask, a mashed avocado and honey are great. But I am never buying this again for sure."
3,not what I expect,"based on the price I was expecting more than just a conditioner, but I didn't feel the diffrence that much, maybe cuz I use it once a week."
2,Wrong product,The packaging was fine but they sent the wrong product. I ordered the mask for fine hair and received the thick hair mask. I opened and used it before I realized it was the wrong item. Be sure to check your item before you use it...
3,Not worth the money,"This product is extremely expensive, but worth it. I was disappointed because I bought this product based on the reviews, but it did not help my dry/curly hair. If I were you over the counter products work just as good as this, if not better. Don't buy this product."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I HAVE THIN AND DAMAGED HAIR AND AFTER I READ ALL THE REVIEWS I DECIDED TO EXPEND MY MONEY IN THIS PRODUCT THAT IS VERY EXPENSIVE. AFTER USING IT FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS MY HAIR IS WORSE THAN EVER, MY HAIR ENDS ARE CRUNCHY AND VERY DRY. I APPRECIATE IF SOME OF THE WRITERS OF THESE FABULOUS REVIEWS COULD GIVE ME SOME TIPS, BECAUSE I FOLLOWED THE PRODUCT INSTRUCTIONS WITH NO LUCK."
5,I love this stuff!..but sooo expensive!,I purchased this for the first time at a high end salon over a year ago. I would use it every day if I could afford to. It makes my hair so soft and smells wonderful!
2,worked with my sister but not with me,i bought it for my sister & she loved it but when i used it for my self & also with my girls it wasn't good
4,Kerastase Masquintense is amazing!,"I purchased masintense about a month ago and have been using it nearly everyday. It only takes a little to cover all my hair (just below my shoulders). I leave it in about 5 minutes on regular days and I wrap it in a warmed towel and leave it about 20 minutes about 1 or 2 days a week. I have damaged, fine hair and it works miracles! Probably not an everyday product (is intense and very expensive), but that's how I use it and it and I really, really like how it makes my hair feel. After a month my hair has a lot less breakage, feels softer, takes less product to achieve my desired style, and just feels and looks more healthy. I didn't give it 5 stars ONLY because this product is very expensive. I will definitely buy again!"
5,"expensive, but WORTH IT!","I'm a hair care product junky, so I've tried more products than I can count and this is the most amazing conditioner ever! It is very expensive, I'll admit, but worth it if you can afford it. (I don't use it everyday because it's so expenseive, but even 2-3 times per week makes a difference. Before a big event I'll use it almost every day for 2 weeks and my naturally blah hair looks worthy of a Pantene commercial!) I don't think the shampoo is worth the price though. It's nice and a little better than drug store brands, but not worth the price."
4,Split ends... repaired?,"I bought this product after my hair dresser at Great Clips - yes, Great Clips - told me that my hair needed some additional moisture. After looking through reviews of several products, a website labeled this item 'the holy grail of deep conditioners'. Though very pricey for what I would regularly pay for hair products (that's why it gets 4 out of 5 stars), I can definitely see a noticeable difference in my hair appearance. My split ends are virtually gone. My hair feels less frizzy, and it feels like it can actually grow long again. With dry hair, I coat the ends of my hair with it at night before I go to bed, and it needs to be rinsed out in the morning to get the product out, and my hair feels GREAT! Not sure if I'll be using this every day for the rest of my life, but it's great for those big days like getting hitched!"
2,By designers for designers,"My copy does not say ""Decorating with natural materials"" and I was looking for real ethnic interiors. So I found that this book was really by designers, trying to interpret their idea of ethnic interiors. This was not what I wanted. Also the layout of the book is odd - the full page photos are not of interiors so much as more like style pages, and the actual photos of interiors, which are of designers' homes, are fairly small so that I considered getting out my magnifying glass in order to see the details. There is a lot of writing and I began to wonder who she thought she was writing for.The other odd thing is that these homes were seemingly all in the United States. Write an ethnic book from the comfort of your own country.....So, it did not work for what I needed -- real visual resources."
3,"Not a perfect fit, but works",There's about a 1/4 inch gap between the bottom of the frame and the beginning of the trim. It works well enough. Installed on a 2000 Malibu
3,GREAT Moves - But NOT for Beginners!,"I'm not new to Hip Hop, but this was too fast, even for me. They talked a lot at the beginning about how they were going to ""break the moves down."" They didn't. They did each section in half time twice (which is still kind of fast), then on to full speed. Then the next segment and so on. And there are NO views from the back, which makes it a little confusing. These guys and their team are terrific dancers, no doubt. But if you get this DVD, plan on doing a ton of back tracking before you get each section enough to move on."
2,Really boring!,"This dvd does not contain enough nudity as it should. The pace of the video is really slow, which makes it boring. Is not worth the time or money."
3,Not Enough...,"Not enough sustained nudity in this DVD. The camera work leaves the viewer out in left field trying to squint to see anything. This need much more close ups and longer segment of nudity. Unlike ""America's Wildest Bachelor Parties"" where the nudity is close up and for an ended period of time. This Girls Gone Wild video is just a step above something you can see on regular TV just about. Save yourself the buck and pass."
3,I have see better on this series.,Girls Gone Wild on Campus was very good so since seeing this title I was not happy. So keep in mind that others maybe real good. I am very pleased with the first one I bought.
2,Not very good for a new comer,"This book does contain some good information. The problem, however, is that it is not easy to read or follow. This book contains too many non useful graphics and not enough detailed examples. In other words it's real pretty. At the end of each chapter there are Case Studies for the students. In many cases the book did not give enough information on how to complete them properly. I often found myself searching the internet to find answers. This book might be good for someone that has worked as an IT professional. As a new comer, however, I wouldn't recommend it. I'm going to search for a better book."
3,The wonderful college years....,"Pranks, also known as the Dorm That Dripped Blood, centers around 5 college students who spend thier break closing down an unused dorm. Of course all is not well. There is a killer runnig loose. One by one, the killer picks off the students...Daphne Zuniga adds some value to the cast of largely unknown actors.The ending, if you make it through, provides the slasher credo: All does not end well...such is life."
3,the sweet mug 'ems review,"so i got this book for ideas on what to do for this christmas (yeah i always get an early start). last year i did the gifts in a jar and they went over really well, so i decided to do the mug 'ems this year. there's a wide variety of recipes to choose from. it comes with templates for the gift and recipes cards to put with the mugs. i highly recommend this crafters and diy-ers out there."
5,An existentialist in the process,"After reading all of Camus' works I read his notebooks, and all of it sudden his track of mind made sense. You can clearly see the train of thoughts before The Stranger and The Fall. This book is essential for anyone who is into existentialism, absurdism and their derivatives.I would like to say this is more of a philosophical book, but Albert's desire was always to be recognized as a writer more than a thinker. His entries are of an artist expressing his lassitude towards meaning and some paragraphs are harsh while criticizing war, love and human nature. If you are overly religious, this book may not be for you.Great collection of entries from writer who should've won more Nobel Prizes and who is the father of modern existentialism.. still."
4,Reminiscent of Klaatu's Hope,"Dee Long's ""Outside"" is a solid return to his Klaatu roots. This is Long's DIY concept album and it is is highly recommended to those of you who enjoyed the space-prog-lite feel of Klaatu's classic ""Hope"" project. ""Outside"" boasts interesting songwriting and some very tasty guitarwork. I look forward to hearing more from Dee (and perhaps his Klaatu bandmates) ... in the future."
1,works with husbands iPad 4 but not my iPad mini,"It works great with my husbands iPad 4, but it gives me major difficulty working with my iPad mini. When it does work, I have to press way to hard to be good for the iPad itself and my frustration level. I usually can't get it to work at all. I gave up and for the sake of my iPad mini's longevity, gave it to my husband as an extra back up for his slim stylus. To bad as I really love the slimness of the barrel and the smooth way it moves across the screen. It would have been perfect with art apps if it had worked for me. I also loved the color, but all the loves are pointless since the thing didn't work for me on my iPad mini."
5,Best value and lifetime warranty,I have had this PS for almost 6 months without any problems. It is part of my custom built Computer system with dual processors and EVGA tri SLI 570s. I highly recommend this PS for any serious builder.
1,poor psu,"i was told by a friend that this psu is good but unfortunately, its the other way around. when i took the psu out from the box, i already heard a clanking sound of metal inside the psu case. it turned out that the psu is dead on arrival."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"There are some fantastic books on fertility on the market. This one isn't even remotely close. The Fertility Handbook tries to do it all in 135 pages and sadly, ends up doing very little. This little book attempts to cover everything from emotional concerns to all of the causes and treatments of infertility and causes of & living after miscarriage.What happens is this: important topics get watered down, and so simplified that they aren't practically useful. Want to learn how to chart your temperature? Hope you're a quick learner, because you get one paragraph to figure it out. Wandering how you should take care of your body while trying to conceive? Don't miss it - it's all in one paragraph.And yet it's puzzling that there are two pages on selective reduction of multiples, something that very few women will have to face. And if they do, I hope women look at more thorough books than this one to make their decision..."
2,Ok,I thought this book was ok. The book Taking Charge of Your Fertility I ended up buying after this book and I thought that book was a lot more helpful. I would say go with the other book over this one.
2,Dkip this one,"I should have paid more attention to the reviews. Packer is definitely a cute looking vehicle but a complete waste of money ! Do yourselves a favor and skip this one. The plastic peg will break very quickly and make the trailer useless. Ours broke within the first day so needless to say, our son was very disappointed. Not up to standard"
5,A great CD!,"The Notre Dame Folk Choir really knows how to worship God in a way that inspires others to do the same. What an incredible ministry they serve. I was fortunate enough to see them in concert, and they blew me away. God bless this wonderful ensemble. Beautiful music and beautiful prayer."
2,no longlasting value,"My personal experience with this teakettle is that it quickly lost its value. The finish wore off too soon, and the lid over the mouth of the kettle wouldn't close properly. So I could never hear a whistle. The only way I could tell when my water was boiling was when either the water overflowed from bubbling or when I could hear the sound of the water rolling inside. Not recommended."
4,Best CD of the Club Meets Dub serie,"This album gives you a very good overview over variety actually available in electronic dub music and is comparable to the Dubnologie 2 with Dreadzone, Zion Train.. The only only 100% Drum&Base track is the rather poor title of Roni Size(rather try Represenz) -if you want good D&B try the Progression Session by LTJ Bukem with MC Conrad ,EZ Rollers or the Artcore series ie Kemistry and Storm - while the rest a part from Dub o Tronic is fully dancable fast and uplifting dub with some nice 303 breaks. Still one of my favorite CD's for a Saturday clubbing night."
5,A tremendous book,"I enjoyed this book much more in my second reading, nearly twenty years after the initial publication. Full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, Witness Lee was the best Bible expositor I have ever read. In this book he identifies how God has sovereignly directed human affairs during the last 2,000 years, in order that He can accomplish His eternal purpose on this earth."
3,Unfair To Book Consumers,"While this is a good book, it is little more than a re-issue of the author's previous book ""The Origins of Existence"" (which I enjoyed). I find it disturbing and frankly insulting that the author and publisher do not make this fact more transparent to consumers. Why should readers have to pay twice for the same material? Also, I get a bit turned off by science books that attempt to make parallels (even superficially) with religious scripture, as they (sometimes unintentionally) perpetuate the false notion that science and religion are compatible. At any rate, I would recommend this book or the author's previous book for up-to-date views of contemporary cosmology and ""the big picture"". But readers beware: they are one and the same!"
4,A picture is worth a thousand words,"So, what can be said about this ""picture book"". I find that the gender of the person seeing the book for the first time will make a difference. Many women don't appreciate natures expression of ""that"" spot. Males typically appreciate it more, although many ignore the view and are satisfied solely be access to it.But, there is beauty in the human body if we respect it. And, as not all noses are alike, neighter are all vagina's. But, by being ""different"", it doesn't mean they are anything other than a different expression of that part of our body."
3,INTERESTING BUT NOT ART,"I was interested in seeing what other vulvas look like as we are all different. I was amazed to see the diversity in their appearance and felt much better about my own. ""It's not so odd looking after all!"" However, from an artistic approach it was lacking. It is point-blank. The camera is placed a few inches from the vulva, lips spread and that is it. The same for all 32 shots. No lighting techniques, no poses, no description of the person. Just a picture of the vulva which isn't art, in my opinion. I like the book and am going to keep it but because I think it is a nice self-esteem booster and I think it is awesome that women can finally view the vulva with no shame involved and without a pornographic meaning behind it."
2,Interesting subject with boring solutions,"The subject of this book, the female genitalia's close study, could have been handled in various very interesting ways. Unfortunately the photographer did not choose any of the ways I'd find interest in. All the pictures are set in the same way, no playfulness, or any ideas conveyed beyond just plainly showing the subject. I admit, it is a question of taste, one's idea about what photography is for. In my mind these picture are gynecologic equivalents to technical engineering photography, rather than anything to do with art."
1,oh well,Don't waste your money..this book is really bad...the photographs look like they came from a GYN book...no class here.. if you want to see what this book shows..then go get a book on GYN!
1,Horrible,"Save yourself the money and go pick up a men's magazine. The pictures there will be a lot better, and you will get more for your money. Some of the vulva's pictured here would scare an average man."
1,Waste of money,The book is a waste of money to all but the idiotic beginning shoplifter who wishes to be caught. The ideas of the fictitious Caime & Ghone (came and gone)are as simplistic and unoriginal as their names. Loss prevention agents can learn more and more accurate information in one month on the job than by wasting the cost of the book. Experienced thieves would find the information unhelpfull and potentially dangerous to their careers.
4,Fun read for any LP team,Just have to say my boyfriend and I lift weights and when he got this off my list he thought it was a body builder book!!! lolI have been doing LP work for over 19 years in a major department store and I can say I thought I had seen it all. I was wrong. My team is all reading this I think there is a lot of knowledge that can be gained by the incite of someone who has been there done that. Even if a lot of it is BS that only stores with no LP get hit with. Its worth a read and it Will make you laugh.
3,Mixed Bag,"I was glad I found this book because it has much information about the Precolumbian American Southeast, an area whose history is often ignored. It provided a good description of both the archaeology and iconography of the ancient cultures. If you plan to visit any sites in the Southeast, I would recommend this book. However, the first chapter was not worthy of the rest of the book. It showed an appalling lack of knowledge of other civilizations. It was both overromanticized and made unjustified comparisons. Luckily, I decided to continue reading."
4,good suspense,"I am a Sam Groom fan and an Irwin Allen fan so I bought this. It is good film, lots of back story and good acting. It gets a litle slow in the middle, but picks up. It is about a group of friends who take the cable car up from Palm Springs to the top of the mountian for a private party. The owner of the cable car is one of the friends. Lightning strikes the wheels and melts the wheels to the cable. As they hang there, the cable slowly startes to snap. During this there are flashbacks that shows their life as friends and it all plays out like an episode of Knott's Landing. I live pretty close to where this was filmed. I went up on this cable car once. It was not fun. It is frightening enough without having to worry about it breaking."
5,Crossroads of Praise-Notre Dame Folk Choir,"Awesome music, singing and directing-Notre Dame really knows how to pick 'em!"
1,"Looks great, functions poorly","There were so many tea kettles to choose from but this Copco appealed to me because it was kind of funky looking. I was pleased with its appearance when it arrived but quite disappointed when I put it to use. It has a nice whistle but when you pour, water seeps out from under the lid in addition to the spout. This is messy and a little dangerous. I am packing it up and shipping it back today. I think Amazon would do their customers a good service if they pulled it from their inventory."
4,great product,"I'm a person who has high standards when it comes to the things I buy. when I bought this item, I was happy with the detail on the lamp as well as on the plate. the overall construction of the product is very good i was happy with it."
4,good book,This is an excellent overview of the major world religions and the way they address various common themes. Don't let the size of the book intimidate you. It is written in a clear and accessible manner and heavily illustrated.
1,Failed Attempt to Diminish Evolution,"It's hard to read this kind of blindly biased Creationist rhetoric. This is like any other psuedo-analytical Evolution debunking book on the market, the author attempts to belittle Evolution (and he obviously has no real grasp on the theory) by listing supposed logical attacks by Creationists and NEVER once gives the scientific explanation to refute the mis-informed claims. Bottom line is, this is not a book which will even give you an ioda of understanding of Evolutionary Science, it is simply a collection of biased rhetoric written by a Creationist with the sole purpose of making other Creationists feel justified in their silly beliefs. If you are a person who wants FACT and TRUTH, I suggest you read something about Evolutionary Sciences, because this book just goes to show, anyone who disagrees with Evolution can't fully comprehend it and would rather find solace in some imaginary hocus-pocus God of their mind's invention."
4,Comments on Origin of the Human Species,"This book is very definitive about the philosophical meaning of the human origin.It is not a simple read for the everyday man on the street, yet he could derive some benefits reading this book.This book would make a great college textbook about the subject of human orgins and the science and philosohy behind itall.It is important for us to know about evolution especially when it comes to educating our young people. Being a homeschooling mother, I believe reading this book greatly helps to improve my personal understanding of human beginnings and allows me to refute some of the myths about evolution toted as fact to our children."
2,weak and disappointing.,"This is a poor film. The storyline seems to have potential at the start but totally fails to deliver. The biggest flaw in the film for me was that I failed to make any kind of connection with the main characters especially that of George (Daniel Auteil). I had no empathy for them whatsoever which turned into a disinterest as the film rolled on. I've no problems with Juliet Binoche, she is a brilliant actress and did what she was asked but in this instance it was far too little. She is capable of conveying so much more feeling than this. In my opinion the weakness of this film is due to the director, the story is ok and could have been so much better. One final note which I did not like about the film; there is a scene where a cockerel clearly has it's head cut off. Although this happens throughout the world everyday I thought the days of harming animals for films had passed us by."
3,if you like David Cassidy..,"Both these artists muscled for top spot in teen beat in their era. Sherman did his ""own"" thing musically more than Cassidy, but both are comparable in their music style, audience and abilities. Sherman was also pranced out as an actor in ""Here Come the Brides"", a short-lived color western TV series in the 60s."
2,Limited play value,"I usually love Melissa and Doug toys. Bought this for use in our program with toddlers up to age 3. So far, it has not held the attention of any of them."
5,"Awesome Stuff ""Praise the LORD JESUS ! ! ! ""","Every year starting around Sept.- Oct. I get funky in the ""chest-lung"" area.When I had and used Bronc-ease I got over it Pronto ! ! ! Now that I don't have any, I have been in the hospital 5 times Yes, That's 5 Times with Pneumonia the last 2 years and that's the Honest Truth as JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF is my Witness ! ! ! AMEN ! ! !"
1,Handle Broke,"I agree with the previous reviewer. I actually read her review prior to purchasing the kettle, and figured that her handle breaking was a fluke.However, my handle just broke 2 months after purchasing the tea kettle.I haven't tried contacting Copco about it."
2,"broken, like everyone else!",my teapot broke probably 6 months after i bought it at crate and barrel. I was really disappointed- the piece that holds the metal whistle closed (at the spout) is plastic and has totally fallen apart- and we have to manually open and close it with a hotpad. don't buy this product!the only thing good about it is it looks nice on my stove and we can still boil water.
1,Handle broke here too,"After a week, the spigot button on the handle fell apart and would no longer work. This teakettle is a piece of junk. Don't be fooled by a good price."
4,A Must Have!,"We purchased this DVD along with the Cedarmont Christmas Carol DVD for my daughter in November. She was almost two at the time. By her birthday, she was able to sing Jingle Bells and many other songs with the kids. She loves watching this DVD and the Christmas Carol DVD. If you are familiar with the series, you'll appreciate the added features of the DVD because it gives you interesting facts about locations and the actors. We really enjoy the series. Four stars for this DVD but 5 for Christmas Carols since it has more upbeat songs."
3,It's OK.,I was looking for the version of the program that worked for me in the past. This was not the one.
3,Brash Bravado,"This album contains music of historical importance for the mandolin. Two of the songs (My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice & Gallantry) were extremely beautiful, and were instantly among my all-time mandolin favorites. Much of the album, however, was too brash & too tinny for my taste. The ""cascading tremolo"" I was expecting was not as pervasive as I might have wished. If you are particularly fond of marches & dances (waltz, polka, etc.), this might be a great choice for you, but I could do without the bravado."
2,Kinda shoddy.,"Ok, so the product doesn't look like the amazon photo. the box is not factory sealed but TAPED, the blister was taped to the card with shipping or Scotch tape and....i dunno, still kinda cool but pretty worthless as a collector piece. might as well bust it out of the box and play with it cause i don't think it's the real deal. seems like a re-issue."
3,Not the best of the series,"This series in general is excellent, and this is not a bad book at all, it's just that the other books in this series are much better. Let's face it, mammals don't change color or mimic sticks, or other such interesting things while hiding. Mostly they try to blend in to the background, and since the style of drawing in this series tends to de-emphasize background, the mammals don't hide too well comparatively speaking. Buy it if your child loves the series, but for starters, I'd recommend ""How to Hide a Butterfly"" or ""How to Hide a Meadow Frog"" instead."
3,WARNING: Printed pieces of paper inside the kettle!!,"I was very happy with my purchase of a Porto Kettle last night.Excited about my first cup of healthy tea I rinsed out the kettle in the dim light of my night lit kitchen and brewed my tea.Imagine my horror when I discovered this morning that not only had I been brewing my green tea but also the probably toxic inks of the warranty notes that some MORON had placed INSIDE of the tea kettle!!!!What the hell?????Make sure to look inside the kettle before use!*On the positive side: the kettle is nice and small for one person, and heats the water quickly. I don't have enough experience with it to find out if it will have the problems the other review is talking about."
5,Timeless fun!,"I have the original version of this book from when I was a child. Now I read it to my kids (girls, 5 & 7) and they both love this story and the Self titled Tim Mouse. The illustrations are wonderful and the plot is simple but exciting for this age group."
5,Wow!!,"This book transcends almost everything that's out there in the way of personal growth. Way beyond The Secret or the Law of Attraction, if you're ready to up your game beyond the kindergarten new age pabulum stage, this book is for you. At once psychedelic and practical, the strategies in this book will help you expand your consciousness and make you a better human being. Check out the ""essence eye"" - you'll be amazed. If you're ready for this book it'll change your life!!"
1,Author using book for self praise,Not sure if the author is trying to enumerate a technique to use the power of I am or trying to boast about himself. He has used more than half of the book boasting about himself. While i will refrain from doubting his honesty about his experience.. it is of little relevance to me whether he got a speeding ticket from a cop or not Or how his mother behaved with him. The context of these examples should have been in terms of what needs to be done.. not the other way around. Waste of money!!
1,"Lacking clear, precise presentation and missing some shrubs!","I bought this book to get ideas on shrubs, and it has a lot of choices, but it lacks the best choices for evergreens like Lorapetalum & Nandina (Heavenly Bamboo). A southern shrub planting must have plants like these that provide evergreen fullness and color! More importantly it lacks clarity --- it just rambles on from one page to the next with no page breaks from one shrub to the next, and the main info you need to know about a shrub is either hard to find or non-existant. I recommend buying Taylor's 50 Best Shrubs for anyone, beginner or pro, and forget this one."
4,Facts not faith.,"The book lays out a logical and easy to follow argument on why God didn't create man. It relies on science and common sense to give the reader an alternative to what is blindly accepted as God's inspired word as it is believed and followed by the world's three main religions. This book is not for the faint of heart, it nakedly parades reality in front of you and you might not be ready to face exactly what that means. If you are a true believer in God you might not want to read ""And Man Created God"" as it just may shake the very foundation in which you rest your faith."
2,Poorly written,"Although easy to read, this book was poorly written and in sore need of editing. I was rather annoyed at mispelled words and portions of text missing. The logic at times was rather weak and Mynchenberg does more borrowing of ideas from other people than developing ideas of his own. As someone who has studied both physics and evolution I felt as if his review of these was a virtual whirlwind. This portion of the book should have been condensed and important points made rather than just listing facts/theories. Scientists and especially non-scientists would find this area quite boring. His criticisms of religion are less than novel and if you are really interested in reading a quality critique of religion try Thomas Paine's, The age of reason. Despite the impressive title, this book is a disappointment."
3,"Original Artists, but NOT the original recordings...","Although these versions of golden oldies are mostly true to the feeling of the originals, be aware they are ALL new stereo recordings. Though they are done by the original artists who made them top hits back in the 60's, these are not the original versions of the songs!That said, this compilation does have a fine selection of cuts for the price, as long as you are not expecting the same exact instrumentation you used to hear on the transistor radio at the beach, or on the jukebox at the diner."
4,Loved these characters,And I think I may know some of them here in NC. Didn't want the book to end. How do I get an invitation to dinner?
2,Flavorless,"There is not one surprise in this book, no risks taken by the author. The setting, characters, and theology are all loosely depicted...bland such that they are familiar and unquestionable. I finished the book knowing as much about the characters and their takes on the world as I did upon first being introduced to them.I did enjoy some of the humorous scenes with Mattie, the undauntingly good-hearted protagonist, and the coloquial dialogue, and I do recommend reading it if you have a couple uncommitted hours and can borrow the book from someone. Or if you need a light distraction for a long plane ride. But if your reading time is sparse or your pockets light, save your time and money.Read some Flannery O'Connor instead."
2,A Short Story at Best,"No offense to Clyde Edgerton, but Walking Across Egypt left me empty. The story line was dragged out and repetitive. I ask any reader of this review to read the Ferrol Sams trilogy and compare writing styles. If you want a real feel for life in the south don't waste your time with Walking Across Egypt....Read Ferrol Sams."
5,Funny and Sweet with a Twist,"I have read all of Clyde Edgarton's books, and loved them all. This is still my favorite as all the main characters receive some kind of redemption and achieve some sense of meaning in their lives through interactions with each other. it's such a life affirming book that it should be read by anyone going through a troubling patch. The grandma in the story attempts to help a dilinquent teen, and has a number of mis-adventures along the way. It's an entertaining ditty with some good lessons in it for everyone."
4,"A fun, light read","Walking Across Egypt was a perfect ""first book of summer."" The characters are very realistic (even when doing very unrealistic things) and the storyling moved along quickly. The main characters are likable, and people you wish you know, or might recognize from your life."
3,Not the best,"I have recently become a Clyde Edgerton fan so I'm reading a lot of his books. My favorite is Raney and I also very much enjoyed Killer Diller. What I really like is how real the people seem, products of their environment but rising above it with regularity. This one fell a little short. Mattie is spunky and her values are admirable as she tries to help Wesley, one of the ""least of us."" Some of the others in the story, however, seem a little brittle and stereotyped: Mattie's children, Robert and Elaine; the handyman, Lamar; the neighbors and the other members of the church. I finished the book wishing the best for Mattie and Wesley and the dog but with no regrets that the book was over. Not bad, but not, in my opinion, the best of this author."
5,There's a movie!,"I havn't read the book yet, but I've watched the movie. It is one of my favirote movies. If you read the book and liked it, you should definetly go rent the movie."
4,Its a trip to North Carolina without leaving your easy chair.,"A delightful read...the characters are as real and lovable as the cornbread and country ham. What more could you ask to go along with the jail break, attempted kidnapping, and Sunday dinner for everyone before the cops show up."
4,A pleasant surprise,"Enjoyed this book but wasn't what I thought it would be when I bought it.--should read the synopsis first. Good character development and just a pleasant little story about an elderly naive woman and a very young man in a work release program that she befriends-actually decides to ""save"". Humorous and serious at the same time. Happy reading!"
5,Clyde Edgerton puts on quite a dance with Mattie & Wesley,"First I read Raney. Then I read everything Clyde Edgerton has written. And I don't know why this book is classified as YA; I'm a good 5 decades removed from YA status, and I loved this book.Walking Across Egypt, the title of church-going Mattie's favorite hymn, is southern folks, southern setting, southern cooking, and southern humor at their best. Once she's finished watching her soap operas, Mattie Riggsbee, a 78yo widow, decides to take in Wesley, a small-time juvenile delinquent, and determines to see if her pies and biscuits can make an honest young man of him. They need each other in wildly different ways, as rapidly becomes apparent. The plot gathers speed when Wesley high-tails it to Mattie's house when he escapes from a detention center - and the sheriff comes a-calling.Highest recommendation - for adults, and yes, for YAs, too."
4,Walking,"The widowed Mattie Rigsbee's belief that she must follow the Lord and ""love the least of these my brethren,"" gets her in a lot trouble when she meets Wesley Benfield, a pie-loving, biscuit-eating, juvenile delinquent who's not yet seen the error of his ways but loves her cooking and likes taking a bath in her tub anyway. Mattie decides to help the boy, but only after she's finished watching ""All My Children,"" gone casket shopping with her sister Pearl before it's too late for either one of them, and worriedly wondered whether her own two children will ever settle down and have families of their own. This book was good, I've rradi it twice, I recoomend it to anyone who enjoys easy reading and southren authors."
4,what a recipe!,"Get out your bowls, mix well: One humorous 78 year old female, Mattie, who strongly believes that no day should go by without 3 full, solid meals a day, who even in the height of crisis encourages any and all responding police, neighbors, juvenile delinquents, and her family to just have a ""bite to eat before you go."" (and they all do!) Nosey paranoid neighbors who sleep with armed weapons under their pillows and WILL use them. A dog catcher captivated by free meals and her charming 78 year old ways. A juvenile delinquent who can't decide to steal her silver, her pound cake or her heart. Her two unmarried 30 something children, who believe the worst is happening, Mom is going senile.. An entire church congregation who must cope with a christian soul going awry.Sit down and enjoy the results!"
5,this album is a small gem,"Being born in Quebec in the late 70's I grew up listening to this music...until i moved to the States in grade school...on a lark i decided to look it up and was really happy to find it here in the US. Fans of folk pop will enjoy the flawless harmonies and catchy hooks, but really the best part is the slice-of-life glimpse into the modern Quebecois experience...something that can only be experienced if you know the language. They sing in heavy Quebecois dialect, so french students may have a bit of trouble following the lyrics...which is really too bad, this album is worth getting to know."
5,"Vanity Fair meets Architectural Digest for those with real style!,","Much, much more than other coffee table books!It's a design and style book that reads like a great celebrity or style magazine! The elegant cover caught my eye, the interior and exterior home photos inspired new decorating ideas, and the inside scoop of Hollywood's movers and shakers made me want to curl up with the book just as a good page-turner novel does! Hostetler has found the right mix for anyone with high-end, edgy and in-the-now home design sensibilities.Done - it's on the top of my Holiday gift list for friends, family and co-workers this year!!!"
1,disgusted Angeleno,"I've lived in LA for fifteen years. I love this city but it's not a place that immediately reveals its best side. If you want to see worst of LA buy this book. It's a catalog of the most self-involved and vacuous people this city has to offer, people whose contributions to society consist of ""event planning"" and ""night club promotion."" If everyone in this book disappeared tomorrow, who would notice?"
2,Hip Hollywood Homes: An intimaate look at L.A........,Mostly interior views and they were not impressive. Many people not in that area have more lavish houses than many featured.
2,Better production quality needed,"The sound mixing on this is of not good quality. I'm sure that the producers hoped that the sounds ocean waves would be relaxing and calming but the sound is so loud and the spoken instruction so soft that I found it a stuggle to follow. After a few attempts, I gave up in frustration. I've been familiar with the exercises for years so it's not anything related to that. Additionally, there are a number of tips on how to do the exercises but they are all drowned out but the background sound. Too bad!"
1,After 3 weeks it's busted.,I would not recommend getting this one. I purchased this tea kettle 3 weeks ago. It looked elegant and functional at the same time. Initially it worked out well. Now the handle part which controls the whistle lid broke. It is made of plastic which can easily break. Now I cannot pour water out using the lever instead I need a utensil to open it while I pour. The handle/which area is really poorly made. I brought it at the time for 24.99 and I can see why it's reduced now. Even at the reduced price I wouldn't buy it.
1,beautiful but not functional,I just redecorated my kitchen using a blue and white theme and thought this blue teakettle would look great on my new stainless steel range. Well-look beautiful is all it can do. After two weeks the plastic ring around the spout melted from the heat of the steam. It should never have been made with a plastic part in that critcal spot to begin with. The handle is fixed in a manner that you must have a potholder or you wil burn your hand from the steam when you pick it up. Now I have to buy another kettle because I already sent my old faithful Farberware one to Goodwill.
1,sporting clays,The game will run under windows XP Pro but it is unplayable. Game only shows the middle section on screen. You first see the bird just as it hits the ground.Waste of money.Rich
3,"Pretty good, but could be a lot better","This was a fun Father's Day gift for me. It is ""full size,"" but probably the smallest adult-sized helmet. Two negatives: (1) the ""neck"" padding at the back is held on by velcro and falls out easily (probably no big deal since it's just going to sit there more of the time). (2) the Longhorn logo on the side of the helmet is just a sticker (complete with an annoying (R), registered trademark sign). That means it's really just a plain white plastic helmet with a sticker on it. On the bright side, the facemask (with ""HORNS"" on the front) and chinstrap seem reasonably authentic. I'd actually give it 3 1/2 stars if I could. Supposedly you can get a, actualTexas Longhorns Ncaa Authentic Full Size Helmet, but it's more than twice as expensive (and I haven't seen one in person).In any case, this is definitely a cool thing to have on your desk if you're a diehard Longhorns fan. Hook 'em!"
3,3 1/2 stars for something different and fun,"I wasn't aware of this graphic novel or comic book, whatever it is, but I thought the trailers and premise had some promise. Granted the plot is pretty juvenile and the acting isn't very good but I actually had a pretty good time. I would have like to have seen a bit more writing punch especially the jokes and the 7 ex's was maybe 2 or 3 too many; but it was something different and fun. Having said that, I wonder if Michael Cera will ever allow himself to be a different character."
5,Scotty rocks,"This is a great film, very enjoyable. My husband and I can watch it over & over again and not get bored. It has everything you would want in a film: action, romance and comedy."
4,Will probably become a cult favorite,"I got this for my young adult son, who loves it. I watched it while he was showing it to his older brother, who didn't like it quite so much.I do remember the whole early save-the-princess games our kids would play (think ""Mario Brothers"" and ""Zelda""), which is probably somewhat of a must for ""getting"" this plot, but I'm sure my age and general lack of enthusiasm for and actual participation in such things at the time probably reduces my understanding of subtle things in the movie. I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again (like my son does, over and over), but I do think the plot stands fairly well on its own (boy meets girl, boy wants girl, boy has to jump through hoops to get girl), even without gamer knowledge, if you can just go along with the idea that this is a pretty good ""real"" depiction of a virtual reality moment. The whole thing is actually quite creative.Three stars for me, five from my son - a four star average."
5,This movie is my prozac!,"I love this movie...the unique and creative storyline is active, full of fun rock music, and engaging from beginning to end."
5,Fun and Unique,"Scott Pilgrim may not be for everyone, but I highly recommend that everyone should give it a look. I definitely haven't seen a movie like it before and totally loved it. It's a bit rushed, but it's understandable, since the movie crams about 7 volumes of a comic series into one movie. I enjoyed Scott Pilgrim so much that I actually went to see it three times in theaters. This was the only time I actually went to see a movie multiple times in theaters, since I'm way too cheap to pay $10 for a second viewing most of the time. Support Edgar Wright and see this film!"
4,"Very different, fun film","This was a great, original film. The premise of the main character (Scott) having to go through the levels of a video game to win his true love is done in such a fun way that you're smiling the whole time you're watching this movie. Many, many references to geek/nerd culture, so pay attention! Catch them all and maybe you'll win a bonus! :-)"
4,Pretty good,"I enjoyed the effects, the music, and the pace of this movie. I give it points for originality. Its a comedy with a moral tale. I expect some people may hate it, but I think it holds up well even watching it the second or third time round."
5,Teenager's favorite,"My Sophomore asked for this, and received 2 copies for Christmas. He loves it so much, we decided to keep the 2nd copy instead of returning it, so that he could give it as a gift at the next upcoming bday party he attends."
4,Great supporting characters,"I liked the movie. It was campy and catoonish. I knew it was going to be like that and I appreciated it. I loved the supporting characters: the gay roommate, the F word girl, Knives, Scott's bandmates and his sister."
1,Overrated,"I rented this movie based on the reviews, I even played a demo version of the video game on the Playstation 3. The movie starts out ok in the beginning, but somewhere past the halfway point the movie became too ""wild"" and repetitive. I actually felt sleepy and wanted the movie to end. Fortunately I only rented in for $0.99."
1,"Great Movie, but buy in store do not download","Really enjoyed the movie and recommend it to anyone who is interested. But do not under any circumstances download this movie! Buy it in stores. That is the sole reason for the 1 star rating. The download comes with digital rights management (DRM). This makes it impossible to watch the movie on anything but the computer you download it on. You cannot burn it to a dvd, you cannot transfer it over to personal computers. I bought this download for a friend for Christmas since I couldnt find it in stores. Now I have to re-buy this movie because I can't copy it over to my friends computer or burn it for them."
1,How in the hell did anybody like this movie?,This movie is THE WORST movie I've ever seen. I saw all the good reviews and decided to watch it because it sounded like a really good comedy. I didn't laugh one time during this movie and I thought its attempt to humor failed miserably. I can't believe I wasted a dollar renting it and I also can't believe I watched it all the way through. It blows my mind as to how many people actually liked this movie. K.O.
2,"Mehhh complete kids flick, but rated adult.","Unless your ages 12 - 17 this movie is not for you. The worst part is that is a Adult movie that plays like a cartoon network show. A little like adult swim, but not as good. I have never written a review before, but for this movie I was so mehhh I had to. Do not rent this movie, If you want to watch it do it on netflix, though don't expect to watch the whole thing and enjoy it.It reminds me of kickass, but without all the things that made it a good movie. I gave it two stars because despite not liking it I kept watching, I would compare it to animal planet, where you know the poor baby giraffe is gonna get eaten by the lions but you can't turn anyway, or a video of someone throwing puppies in a river, its wrong on so many levels but you keep watching to see how much worse it can get."
1,What the ......... Was this actually a movie?,"I don't drink or take drugs, but that might be the only way to appreciate this movie. Sanity called and wants my TV back. I am very frightful of the future due to the positive reviews this movie has received. If I feel dumber for having watched this thing, what about those who don't even realize they are dumber from having watched it. I will admit that it wasn't the dumbest as there was a few entertaining points to it, but overall I was stunned at the presumably acid induced idiocy."
1,Thank God I rented it first!,"Ug. What a horrible movie. I am so open-minded when it comes to movies...you don't even know. I could tell from the first 20 minutes that I wasn't going to enjoy this one. I sat through it anyway because I don't believe in walking out or turning off a movie when it's not finished. Otherwise, you can't really form an opinion. I can't even explain how much I disliked this one. I didn't get one bit of it. Let's just say my roommate walked through the living room a few times and caught bits and pieces of Scott Pilgrim and he thought it looked horrible. He was right. lol I can't find one thing to defend in this movie. Not even gorgeous Chris Evans could save this one for me. :("
1,was this intended for children?,I would leave a long discouraging review but this movie already waisted 2hrs of my life so I'll keep it short and say don't waist your time.
3,Not sure what I was expecting.,I watched it to look at Mary Elizabeth Winstead's delicious face for two hours. The movie was a comic book nerds dream I suppose.
3,Suprising,Before this movie I had tired of Cera's acting but he does well enough to stay out of the way of ruining the fun. Runs a bit long for a tribute to geeks and video games but not a bad movie for a night in.
2,A Bit Dull...,"I watched this movie from a recommendation from a friend. The layout of the movie is a little weird in my opinion. It has a comic book/video game feel to the movie, and I believe it was intentional. It's normally not my genre of movie. There were some funny moments in the movie, but it was seldom, and I often found myself bored because the plot is a little confusing and I thought it was weird."
5,I so Lesbians this movie!,"This movie is great. Best movie of 2010. I did not expect this to be a good movie before I watched it. Boy was I wrong. It's a non stop ride that left me exausted and happy at the same time. It's definitely an experience more than a movie. It's clever in its script and the actors all work together to make it a fresh movie experience. This could have been done wrong and been very cheesy but the clever dialog, editing and special effects along with fun actors makes this movie great. Highly reccommend this movie. You are guaranteed to lesbians this movie."
3,Where did the digital download go?,"Bought this new and on the day it arrived I tried to get the digital download only to be informed it is unavailable. As they dont include a disk, there is no recourse other than ripping the movie to the format I need by hand."
1,"""Worst movie ever!!!""",Total waste of time thought it would be cool stupid stupid everybody sucks except mary elisabeth winstead who is hot! I felt like boring my eyes out would be more fun.
1,"Childish, wanna-be-hip hype, yawn!","Pandering hype that might appeal to someone on lots of dope, including alcohol, who wants to hitch a ride on someone else's fictitious life. The filmmakers are trying to force their belief-systems on the unsuspecting children who will watch this trashy movie and they should be ashamed but let's leave that to people with consciences and valid value-systems. This movie is one of many that are produced out of desperation because EVERYTHING interesting has been done already several times over. Read Ecclesiastes! It's much more interesting and valuable than this hype garbage movie."
1,Ugh.,"I am not a videogame connoisseur, so if I am completely off, sorry. This was the worst movie I have seen in a while. I really tried to watch and enjoy it, but couldn't even get myself to finish it. I love movies of many genres and styles, but could not get into this at all. I enjoy Michael Cera and the other actors in the film, but this was simply not my cup of tea. I hate to say it, but I want my money back for the rental."
1,"A modest ""student film""","Except for the expensive CGA work, this seems like the production of a Canadian undergrad film school student. I truly found it silly and a waste of time, but if you are under 18 and jonesing for an underage Chinese chick, maybe you will get it. I didn't care how it ended or who was left after ""game over""."
1,rsylvester27,"I did not find a reason to watch this further after the first 25 minutes. This was ignorant, a waste of time and sad."
2,Scott Pilgrim,"I started watching this movie expecting more than what it really turned out to be. Some movies exist in a fantasy world where impossible things happen, but you know that going into them and that's exactly what they were made to be, where Scott Pilgrim tries to be a normal movie in a normal world with all kinds of impossible stuff going on in it, and nobody in that world finds it odd. The special effects are pretty good in the movie and the last fight scene with the G-man is pretty cool, but the overall movie was too odd and sometimes boring. The part Michael Cera plays is also old and worn out. It was funny to watch in his first movie, but really didn't help the movie here since its the same basic character he plays in every movie. I guess if you have read and enjoyed the books you will probably enjoy the movie. Those that have not may find this to be not worth watching."
2,PUSHES THE LIMITS OF THE GENERATION GAP!,"Boy! Do I feel old.....I'm usually a pretty hip guy, but this film made me feel like I was 80 years old. Scott Pilgrim leaves a lot to be desired...if you're over 40(maybe younger?). I admire the fact that they tried to do something fresh, but I found myself getting bored with the ""bad trip"" antics after 20 minutes or so. I have always liked Cera, so that wasn't the problem and I like movies that think outside the box, but this one just flew over my head....WAY OVER!If you're younger(20 something or younger)you will probably like this frantic train wreck of a farce, but for anyone who was born before 1970, this one will leave you scratching your head(and reaching for an aspirin bottle!)and bored to tears! If ever a film separated the genration gap to its limit, Scott Pilgrim IS THAT FILM!!I wasn't going to review this film, but my Twin Andrew gave it such a glowing review(youngster that he is!:-D) I just had to tell the tale of the other side of the coin. ;-b"
1,Didn't get it,Made it through 45 minutes of the movie. Did not like it whatsoever. Not my type of film. Thought it was pretty ridicuolous.
2,not so great,"Seeing all the amazing reviews here I decided to buy this movie, but it was very disappointing. I loved the style of the movie, but I thought that the action was mellowed down. There was so much potential to make this a hardcore action flick, but they decided to make it funny, and is not good funny. The comedy that is thrown at you is pathetic, sometimes funny, but mostly baaad.Again, the style of the movie is quite refreshing and I really liked that. But by the end of it, I was wondering why I bought this movie at all."
2,Fantastic Flop,"Like others, I expected a lot more from this movie. Based on the previews and description, I believed it would be a great, funny movie. I was disappointed. I found it to be childish and, well, stupid. This is one of the rare purchases that I feel was a true waste of money. If you want to see this movie, I suggest you rent it, that way you will have only lost maybe $5, rather than $20."
2,Did Not Work - defective download - Amazon refunded purchase price,This worked until about half way through and froze and I could not see the end of the movie. Amazon refunded the purchase price.
1,"Pointless, a waste of time and energy",I couldn't even get through the whole thing. Pure idiocy and horrible acting. SuperBad meets the cheesiest 80s movie you've ever seen.
3,One Crazy Movie!!!,"This movie is very unique, and quite different than others. It's like a video game world and a comic book world mixed together on live-action film. A lot of the times, it didn't make too much sense, but you just go along for the ride. It's very colorful, and like a crazy acid trip. I'm sure if you grew up in the 80's, you'll absolutely love this film. A bass guitarist for the band ""Sex Bob-omb"" named Scott Pilgrim begins to slowly fall in love with a woman named Ramona Flowers. Scott soon learns that he must defeat Ramona's 7 evil exes in order for them to have a relationship together. I'd recommend SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD!!!"
5,love this movie.,I love this movie. it is entertaining from start to finish. great editing. great acting. everyone is really good. i would watch this over and over again.
5,Scott Pilgrim vs the World,This movie is hilarious but the humor is a sophisticated dry wit in the style of Juno or Napoleon Dynamite so it will appeal more to those fans than to a general audience. It will also appeal more to young males rather than females due to its video game based theme. Highly recommended.
4,Good for Geeks!,"If you're a geek you will love this movie. it contains a lot of references gamers and computer techs will instantly recognize.While I thought it was hilarious and a fun watch, my significant other pointed out quite a few of the flaws in the story. Normally this isn't a problem but I have to admit a few of them are pretty glaring and are hard to just sit back and ignore."
4,WONDERFUL MOVIE. AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE.,"I would give it 1000 stars if only... Universal would give a better customer service. Or a decent one, at least.I bought this really amazing movie, and when I tried to download my digital copy, iTunes didn't let me, adressing some kind of unexplained error.So I wrote Universal Digital Copy Support, and a week later they replied saying it was Apple's fault, as I didn't live in USA or Canada, and that would prevent me from downloading content from the iTunes Store. Several hours later, when I stopped laughing at such ridiculous statement (I keep buying things at the iTunes store -and downloading them, of course-) I wrote back telling this to them -and considering it was clear it was all Universal's fault- and asked for solution. But they never ever replied to me again.I keep writing to them as I want to have what I paid for. Maybe for Scott Pilgrim III..."
5,AMAZING MOVIE!!!!,"IF YOU LIKE COMICS, VIDEO GAMES AND ANIME, YOU WILL CREAM YOUR PANTS AFTER WATCHING THIS FLICK, I GUARANTEE IT"
5,I love this movie,I love this movie. Very happy with the blue ray and I watch it all the time. I'm a nerd
5,I love this movie!,"Title says it all. I love this movie, plain and simple. For somebody who grew up on the video games this movie draws inspiration from, and a lover of Edgar Wright films, this film is an absolute treat."
4,Just for fun,My kid read all the books and thought it would be fun to watch. Although he said it wasn't exact it was good.
1,worst movie ever!,"Need I say anything additional. This by far was the worst movie ever! Not only is it long, it takes forever and day to get to the point of the movie or even to get started or to just make sense. Ugh hated it!"
1,"Please, someone stop Michael Cera","I wanted to like this movie. Appreciation for comic-book culture: check. Appreciation for video-game culture: check. Appreciation for well-crafted irony: check. Little did I suspect that after my wife and I decided to rent this movie for a quiet night together, we would spend the entire playing time wishing (a) that we had rented something else, and (b) that we could punch Michael Cera in his whiny, emasculated face until he promised never to act again. If it had cost more than $3 I would be requesting a refund."
1,Christmas Disappointment,Package was shrink wrapped and when my son opened it there was a piece of paper with an ad for for the Scott Pilgrim comics and no dvd. Santa brought an empty box. I felt bad for my son because this was something on his list this year.
3,Warning--this may not play properly on some TVs/players,"Don't get me wrong...SCOTT PILGRIM is easily a five-star movie, one of the best I've seen this year. But caveat emptor.The DVD and Blu-Ray will not play properly on all TVs and/or players. In some configurations, the text on the sides of the screen is cut off. It's most noticeable in the scene where Scott sits up in bed and the ""Other Scott"" sits up beside him. You can see that the text for ""Other Scott"" is cut-off; you can't read all of it.I have heard that Universal is supposedly issuing a corrected Blu-Ray in February 2011. I don't know about the DVD; I'd hope they'd fix that, too. I've e-mailed them and will let you know what they say.Meanwhile, proceed with caution, as you may not be able to watch the entire image. For that reason, I'm lowering my star rating, because I have a hard time believing that Universal couldn't reconfigure this disc to fix the problem."
3,Cool Visuals and an Awesome Soundtrack,"I really enjoyed some of the more off beat humor and retrieved video game references, but some of the secondary actors are less than believable. Overall, it was a good movie and I have seen it multiple times, and will watch it again in the future. If you are a fan of other Michael Cera movies, you should enjoy this one too."
3,LSD Trip In The World Of Scott Pilgrim,"Mono tone nerd gamer named Scott is in a band, he has his fair share of breaking up with girls and not staying in a committed relationship until he meets this new girl romana but in order to be with her he has to fight her 7 ex evil boyfriends in game style. When you watch this movie you are in disbelief of whats going on, its a acid trip of todays popular culture, its like watching an arcade game brought to life in a movie. Its imaginary and different I must say, a harmless movie even if its an odd one."
3,"Ok for me, Good if you're into video games","This movie is like a video game turned to life. The CGI is pretty cool, but the overall concept is not for me."
5,Great movie,"If you are a fan of the director, or a fan of comics, or a fan of videogames; Buy this movie."
4,"Great, but don't rent if you want bonus features","I loved this movie and agree with the previous reviewers' descriptions, ""completely fresh"" (I've never seen anything like it!), ""fast-paced"" (whoa,yes!), ""fun"" (great for an escapist viewing night), and ""K.O."" (in more ways than one!) I'll add that there is some exploration of the dynamics of relationships and some romance here, too; nicely done. BUT: If you want the numerous bonus features you need to buy the DVD, not rent. The rental disc does not include the bonuses."
3,Cheezy movie that entertans by making you cringe a lot,Movie is entertaining but gimmicky. Main character is not likable at all. The whole thing is built on awkwardness. A lot of jokes seem forced and way longer than they should be. I would say that it is worth $3 to rent.
5,I really enjoyed this movie,"Well I'm sure some people are going to think this is a cheesy movie and it is, but it was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed the movie."
4,Cutting Edge Fun for Almost the Whole Family,"I really wasn't expecting too much, but Michael Cera once again is able to deliver in his inimitable teenage angst manner. There are tremendous sight gags, sound effects, Seinfeld allusions, and Jason Schwartzman really hits his stride as a villain. Warning:Not for preteens, especially the bonus features which explode many f-bombs."
4,Better than I expected,"I had wanted to see this movie because of its interesting premise. The movie is based on a comic where the protagonist has to fight the ex-boyfriends video game style. Each ex-boyfriend is like a level boss in ascending order of when she dated them. They film makers have done a good job of presenting the video game feeling into a non animated movie. Even though it is probably targeted to a younger audience then myself, it might be better suited to my generation because of the video games it more closely resembles. At first I thought Scott was going to have to get some kind of training to fight the ex-boyfriends, but he was ready to go from the beginning. The fights are way over the top just like Street Fighter. high flying kicks, over powered punches. It is wonderful to watch. The young cast do a great job in their parts and Jason Schartzman does a great job as the main antagonist. I am glad to have purchased this and enjoyed watching it with my family."
5,Crazy fun watch,Goofy but very entertaining movie. A good watch for anyone who really gets a kick out of old school gamer taste.
5,What? I loved this! But Why???Subliminals?,"Every film I've seen by Edgar Wright: the first viewing I find it ""okay to pretty good"" then a few days go by and I start thinking about the film, it seems to percolate, and after awhile I want to see it again. Then I can't see it enough! Very few films hit me this way. I'm in my 40's and loved this movie. Maybe I'm arrested but I think Wright's movies are some of the most well written features of the last 6 Years!"
5,Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,"Crazy, fun movie starring Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim, a slacker/heartbreaker, who meets the girl of his dreams Ramona Flowers played excellently by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. In order to date Ramona, Scott must defeat her seven evil ex's who come from differing backgrounds and gender(her sexy phase as Scott puts it). The movie is like a living comic with funny villains, special effects and comedy. Kieran Culkin stars as Wallace, Scott's gay roomate, and scene stealer. The movie may seem silly and dumb to some but it's a romantic comedy and come on, it's just a movie! Based on the comic, it's a fun movie that will make you laugh."
3,"don't know anything about it,",i hope this will be goog for somebody I know. I don't know what it is about it maybe my grandchildren will enjoy ir as they grow or one of my children.
3,3.5,"The movie was all around decent but if you got the time, watch it. This for me is a watch once and then never again or maybe even a two timer but that is kind of pushing it."
3,Gamers delight,"This film is rife with gaming references. It also screams roots to anime and comics, so it is fun. The story line isn't terribly sophisticated, however it is a fun light film."
3,"Great Film, poor quality package","The film itself is great, perfect hybrid between movie and video game.The case, however, was of substandar quality and very dissapointing. It is really thin, making it easily bendable to the point it might fail to protect the dvd inside should something unforseen happen. The cover art protection paper/plastic is poorly cut and pasted.The extra contents in the dvd are quite good. It has a lot of deleted scenes, a few alternative ones and even an alternative ending, plus all that is listed in the product's description."
3,Great movie but,"The case was in a very very bad state, I didnt like it at all, but the movie is great! Unfortunately there's not even subtitles in portuguese."
2,What the heck just happened?<<<<<CONFUSION>>>>>,"I was so excited to watch this movie I couldn't bear it. I sat down with my wife, sister, and future brother-in-law. When I heard the familiar video game music in the beginning I got so excited and couldn't wait for more. Then I realized that this movie is WAY different than the previews. I don't want to spoil it for others but this was definitely not for me and I feel I'm pretty open to different types of movies."
2,Words won't describe.,Terrible movie. I won't get that hour and fifty two minutes back. Just stupid. I kept thinking about the south park episode. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.
2,Not a movie for those over 10,"Honestly, I love fantasy and cartoons come to life in a movie.....this unfortunately did not succeed in it's attempt. Maye some 10 year old will like it in their hormone confusion but outside of that.....even pot doesn't make it any better!!!!!"
2,Completely disappointed.,"The worst type of film. The one you go into with such high expectations, only to see those expectations dashed."
2,Scott Pilgrim Must Die,"This movie, for all it's attempts to be trendy, flashy, fresh and fun, was a disappointment because of Micheal Cera and his uninspired and unlikeable character of Scott Pilgrim. I don't want this guy to get the girl, or any girl, or anything. I want the League of Evil Exes to crush him. I want to see him badly broken and working in a McDonald's to make ends meet, lamenting on his wasted youth. He's terrible. The special effects, the amazing and very entertaining supportive cast and the quirky humor saved his from being a one star, but with the main character of the movie being so unlikeable I couldn't get past a two star. It's worth watching, but I found myself just wanting to know more about everyone except Scott Pilgrim."
5,EPIC,"Scott Pilgrim VS The World highly relates to the successful cartoon show... FAMILY GUY!The entire movie is random, stupid and makes zero sense! And by the time it all ends... your left cheering for more!Don't listen to the haters. They're just idiots who don't understand fun entertainment... and obviously hate Family Guy."
3,whoaaa,"So what if it's smarmy? So what if he couldn't sing? If there are better recordings nowadays, how come the girls don't scream anymore? Something's gone if the girls don't scream anymore.And ""Julie, Do Ya Love Me"" is one of the best karaoke songs around."
5,toe-tapping sweet pop 4 u!!,"I love this CD!Bobby was a teen idol back in the late 60s-early 70s.I didn't really remember him,but I enjoy catchy pop,especially early 70s ones that speak of innocence and wonder.My friend Chris told me this CD sounds like music the Brady kids would like.Not a bad thing,I think."
3,Fascinating history!,"A lot of useful information is hidden in the lengthy endnotes which should have been included in the main body. So you definitely want to flip back and forth between the main text and the endnotes. The author quotes heavily out of History of the Church which is considered very erroneous by other historians. That makes me think the author is not careful with his sources. It's difficult to piece together the church's history because of all the gossip and conflicting accounts. Keeping in mind that a lot of the material is gossip and might not have been adequately verified, I still think it's a great book and I recommend it."
3,"A bit negative, which is OK unless you're LDS","I am a member of the LDS church. I read this book because the 'fundamentalists' have been in the news again, and I wanted to get an objective history of mormon polygamy covering both nineteenth century polygamy and modern polygamy. Overall, I believe the book is objective. I am curious about the author, because although it says he is a BYU graduate on the cover, he doesn't shy away from quotations from enemies of the church. In fact, from my point of view, he even seems to favor the negative. Most offensive to a devout Latter-day Saint would be the questions raised about the morality, integrity, and honesty of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, etc., which are revered (even today) as prophets by the LDS faithful.I would like to find a book contrasting pre-manifesto polygamy with modern polygamy."
5,Thorough and objective research,"This book is obviously well researched and documented, as evidenced by the thorough footnotes and references. The author does an excellent job avoiding subjective conclusions about the matter, and instead sticks to proven facts. The author does not insinuate that the current LDS church sanctions polygamy, it is simply a thorough look at the church's polygamous past, which can hardly be denied. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Mormon History."
1,"There are no ""Mormon"" groups who currently practice that!",The LDS church excommunicates any member who enters into a polygamist marraige. Absolute misinformation - not even a good attempt at it either.
2,"Good, but not great.","I ordered this product based off price. Compared to other sellers, this SurePak was a deal. However, being in the military and eating my fair share MREs, all of the individual MREs have been ""Rat-F***ED."" Simply meaning, there are food items missing out of each one. SUCH AS; The Pork Rib Boneless should come with bread, a candy, and tobasco sauce. All the MREs have the same thing in them minus the main meal and secondary, other than that its Crackers, Strawberry Jam and a Fig bar...thats it, oh and a fruit punch. All in all it will keep you from starving, but its no where near a real MRE, might as well just pay the extra money and get the good stuff. I will not be ordering these again, I'll just trade with supply guys on base and save the money."
1,Worst MRE I've ever had...,"As a military member, I've eaten MRE's since 1984. I've had good ones, OK ones, and even some not so tasteful ones. I was excited to order a pack of 12 for emergencies. I was highly disappointed in the quality of the main course, as well as those extras in the packs. EVERY MRE had the same side - refried beans. EVERY MRE had 2 rye crackers (cardboard but less flavor). EVERY MRE also had decaf coffee pack and a pack of grape jelly (I guess for the rye cracker??!!). Will give as gag gifts - will not eat. Moral of the story - stick with military issue MRE's."
1,No mention of lack of heat source.,Have bought MREs in the past. All had a heat source. This one does not. Good if you like cold food. No mention of it being a repack in the description. M
1,Not Worth the Money!!,The plug to inflate the ball came out after just a few play times with our grandchildren--age 2-5. Lasted maybe a month. Plastic ball from CVS costing only $1.99 has lasted for over two years. Crocodile Creek ball was a waste of money.
4,Nice little ball,"This is a very cute ball that is a good size. My son didn't take to it quite as much as I thought he would but he plays with it fairly consistently. He also likes to have me bounce him on the ball. The ball comes already inflated, which is nice, but it could use a bit more air."
1,worse product ever,"It had only been slightly played for two weeks, then it started leaking. We identified several big cracks on the ball. Unbelievably bad quality!!! Don't Buy!!!"
1,you say that it covers the office 200 completely including p,you say that the book covers all of word perfect 2000 including paradok. but in the table of contents there is no mention of paradox so which is correct the table of contents or your first mention of what the book covers.
2,Implausible and chauvinistic,"Others have mentioned the improbability of the plotline, and I found a bunch of historical anachronisms. But in a novel where the American is all ""equality"" as well as ""love and honor"" isn't it ironic that the hero comes from a slave-owning culture, and yet despises all the Europeans for their snobbery and ethnic prejudice? A different kind of novel could have resulted had this, and other paradoxes, been engaged at any level at all."
3,OK if you read the same books as a child,"I love the idea of this book, and I really really want to like it more than I do, but I wonder if it only resonates with the reader if you have read the same books during your childhood as the author.I enjoyed the autobiographical parts, struggled through the psychology because I felt I should understand it, but ended up skimming much of the book. Perhaps it's because I didn't enjoy the same books as Spufford when I was a child. If he had waxed lyrical about Anne of Green Gables I may have been more delighted."
2,Typos mar a version with too little detail,"You can strip things down too far. This book takes too much out, and the edition I read (the first half of, anyway) had too many typos to be useful for the intended audience -- people who really don't know the material yet, or haven't looked at it in a long time. This is an embarrassment to the Schaum series, which otherwise I like very much."
1,Simply doesn't work.,"I got this for my father as a gift. It occasionally works for a call or two, then just stops. Sometimes it messes up the dial up connection; sometimes it doesn't let you call out. Sometimes it picks up the call; sometimes it doesn't. We've tried a second one...no luck. It sounds so simple, but it just doesn't work."
2,Corpus Crapus,"Rosalind Krauss' theories have some merits, and if you are looking at a book that will drive you up the wall the entire time shouting at it-- read this. I would never allow my grad students to read this dribble."
2,Not that great...,"I was disappointed when I received this today... I wasn't expecting it to be special effects worthy, but it looks like something I could have gotten at a dollar store. The 'blood' is not as copious as it appears in the picture. Maybe three inches in diameter, if that, just a plastic 'blob'. Any extra drips you will have to provide yourself! It's not a horrible product, but considering I paid almost as much for (standard!) shipping as I did the item itself, I feel a bit ripped off."
1,A big disappointment,"I bought this book, hoping to get a copy as close as possible to the original prints.The result is terrible concerning pictures: some pictures appear black & white only (no shades of gray), others display chessboard patterns.The scan of the book by Google books is of much better quality...and free of charge, so no need buying this very bad paper reproduction."
4,It is absolutely a steal,"Hi, we bought 4 sets(service for 16). With free shipping plus a $25 discount for over $125 purchase,this seems like a steal! I previously looked China at Ikea. The Ikea China are more expensive and look cheap. These China are great for entertain with a style. I am getting rid of all my old China. The reason I am only giving a 4 star is because: 1)There are some minor discoloration inside the China(darker spot over White interior) 2)The edge of bottome seems a little rough. I am worried if they are going to scratch my countertop or scratch each when stacked up. 3)The plates are pretty deep with big rims, so all the food gets into the middle(some people may prefer this way). Since my previous China were more like a flat platter, so it will take me a while to get used to the new set. Still, I strongly recommend this set. If blue is your color, you will be very pleased with its beauty."
1,Do not buy this pattern,"I have this pattern and do not recommend. After about two months it started to get the gray marks of my flatware on it. So now the plates all have gray marks and cups too. I called the company and even the website addresses the gray marks. Buy a special powder and clean it off. I don't know if you have time, but I don't have time to rub cleanser all over 16 plates, 8 bowls, etc. And after you clean with the cleanser, the next time you cut a piece of meat or stir your coffee, GRAY MARKS.I even thought I'd try another Pfaltzgraff pattern (my sister-in-law has the tan & blue plates with no problems), but when I called customer service she couldn't promise it would not happen on my new pattern. I just bought Fiestaware at Kohl's for $19 a place setting with a free fruit bowl.Also, they no longer make this pattern. So if you break, you have to buy at a place like replacements.com"
2,Sundog moments,"I got pretty tired of the cardboard cutout characters, who were all ""too perfect"" even in their failings. I have MS also, and there were many things that were just glossed over and made to seem simple, as if problems could be solved easily, which is not true. The main character didn't seem to have many real emotions about the change in her life, just seemed to want perfection in everything. And the religious slant was fine at first, but then began to make me feel a bit ill because it seemed so self righteous. It just seemed so totally unrealistic to me; nothing is as cut and dried in real life with MS as it was in this book."
3,OK video for the first foray into fingerpicking,"If you can get around the poor video production quality, and the nerdy and nervous host, this isn't a bad little video, especially when you consider it's low price. I am not a good guitar player so I found the four short songs taught here somewhat challenging. There are 3 songs in the key of ""G"", and one in the key of ""D"". It's hard to find any teaching aids in this category so I was happy to have it."
1,mailing list is sold,"The publisher sells the mailing list for this newsletter. My mom is now receiving more junk mail of the type that confuses seniors (asking for money) and has even received scam phone calls. The newsletter is helpful, but I now worry that she will be a victim of a scam."
4,"Yes, they are GREEN",They work well. I wish the paint was not so THICK as I had to sand down the paint for the pads to fit onto the caliper guides.
1,mari's not the best.,"she's annoying. i think i'm just used to having my workouts choreographed to music. i'm a dancer, and it just BOTHERS me that she doesn't do the moves in keeping with the rhythm of the music in the DVDs.other than that, it's an OK work out... it really isn't that challenging.the accelerated body sculpting DVD's not that much of a challenge. i would certainly DO the workouts everyday if it weren't for the lame choice of music and her irritating way of counting.honestly, i actually also appreciate it more when the instructor is actually doing the workouts WITH you rather than standing around counting. ellen from the crunch pilates DVDs did that, which i definitely recommend over these overpriced DVDs. i just sorta do the DVDs just to get it over with. it's NOTHING i look forward to. (again, CRUNCH is so much more enjoyable, challenging... maybe it's not ""authentic"" pilates, but i really don't care so long as i get a good workout from it.)"
1,What happened?,"I ordered the set because I needed the 20 min workout as mine was broken....when I received the 3 DVD set... the 20 min workout was missing. I'm very disappointed, when youfind it could you please send it. Thanx."
5,16 and was overwieght now im fit again!,Im sixteeen and wieghted 153lbs I was borderline overweight and was already experiencing health problems. Winsor pilates helped me flatten my stomach give me more flexabilty and iam now 127lbs the best ive ever looked with the help of the special k diet and running 3 miles a day. With the right diet and exersise for you with the combo of the 20 minute workout included in this dvd you will get amazing bennifits just like I did! With the courage and strength this can change your life as it did mine and give you GREAT results youll be wearing anything you want soon!
4,Great for getting Flexable,"I really enjoy this workout a lot. I am very stiff and my range of movement is not great so I feel this will really help me. It is not something that gets your heart going fast or makes you sweat. It does some muscle toning, especially your stomach. But it is not something I would do as a complete weight loss tool but rather as a supplement. I think it is a great way to warm up for the heart-pumping workouts. The only problem I have is I find I am waiting a while for the next workout to begin as Winsor explains each workout. That's good to have an introduction but after you get to know the moves there's no need for it and you're just waiting. The kit also included a DVD that goes over each move in great detail so there really isn't a need to do it again.Over all, I really love it and do it everyday! I really notice a difference and think I will only get better."
5,Perfect suppliment to your mat class.,"I love this set so much I am buying a few more of her DVD's. I started a little over a month ago at a studio once a week for a group mat class and use the 20-min and 57-min DVD at home on the remaining alternating days during the rest of the week. Although, Mari does a good job at demonstrating the exercises, since I am new I want to be extra sure I am using the proper form and will remain in a class for the additional coaching. I find Winsor Pilates compliments my class perfectly. I have dropped 10 pounds since starting and can really feel the difference."
3,Alright,"This DVD set is alright, but I liked Pilates for Dummies, Pilates for Everyone, and Classical Pilates DVDs better. I've seen some of the infomercials for Winsor, and I think the other videos are more authentic, more real, more traditional."
1,Waste of time and money!,"Before you get fooled by the infomercial, do yourself a favor and do some research. Read reviews everywhere or borrow it from the library first. She won people's attention by a great marketing strategy. Yes, the celebrities and skinny models endorsing them.....those people have good genes and private chef to cook for them. But let me be fair, her moves would help show more toned muscles on people who are already slim. However, to claim that you'd lose the weight doing her program...I don't think so. Although it's written in fine print (in the pamphlet that came with the DVDs) that you'd change how your body looks when you combine it with sensible eating and cardio.....Bottomline, there are other much better Pilates programs like Ellen Barrett's or even Denise Austin's. I'm not a big fan of Denise Austin but I'd do her Pilates over Mari's....Her video has a lot of talking and very few reps. NOT recommended!"
2,"Incomplete, crappy purchase!","This item was suppose to be a 3 disc set. I only have 2 discs, the 20 minute workout, which is 90% of the reason I bought this, is missing."
3,Great Pilates Workout,"This a great pilates workout for beginners and advanced. I especially love the 20 minute practice for days when I have only a short amount of time. I am over 40 and can say if you stick with this, it does work!Sometimes the instruction gets a bit annoying, with the ""tweeze your buttocks"" comments. Overall, a great DVD."
3,She talks too much,"Now, granted, I have taken 6 months of Pilates classes with a live instructor so I am not exactly a true beginner, but in the 20 minute workout you get about 5 minutes of actual exercise. IMO, she should explain all the body positions and safety info in a separate section so you could actually get 20 minutes of workout. I think one would use this set of DVD's once or twice and then be ready to go on to something more advanced. Kind of expensive for that much use.I also think she is a bit condescending when she says you can keep your head down if you have a ""delicate"" neck. I wouldn't say my neck is delicate it just gets tired after a while.I hope there are better DVD's out there, as for now I guess I will have to go back to the ""live"" classes for a Pilates workout."
1,not worth the price,"there are three dvds, but only two have excercises on them. The moves are very slow to begin...I have found the same problem with other pilates videos. there's no option to shut winsor off and just do the excercises and no option to skip ahead..it just starts over....it's a LOT of TALKING."
1,annoying voice,"She knows what she is talking about but her voice is very rough sounding and grated on my nerves, after 40 mins of ""body sculpting"" I had to quit."
5,Pilates Fan,I wore out the old VHS version of Windsor Pilates. Received this DVD set in practically new condition. Great value for the price.
3,Pilates,"I never really worked out much in high school other than what was required in phys ed. When I got to college I thought about doing some workouts. I started with Pilates, to strengthen my core and get more flexible. The basics video wasn't that hard for me. The 20 min workout was a challenge and whoa the accelerated sculpting was a challenge! Although I didn't lose any weight or inches off my waist or anything, I'm pretty sure I gained flexibility and a stronger core. If you're just starting to work out, this is certainly a good place to start. If you're looking for a more advanced beginner workout, this isn't it."
5,"Terrific Pilates Workout, Especially for Beginner","This is a terrific pilates workout DVD, expecially for beginners. Fast shipping.This was recommended by my physical therapist. I would recommend to a friend."
5,Great Workout DVD Set,I hate to exercise but like Winsor Pilates because it tones my body in just 20 minutes per day. Previously owned this workout series in a VCR tape. Decided to upgrade to DVD. I bought used and was plesantly pleased that the DVDs were in good condition.
3,Decent product - high price tag,"I bought this 3-dvd set and find it overall to be a good workout, but it's not worth $59.99. (Daisy Fuentes's infomercial appearance boosted the price?)Mari explains the moves very clearly - which is great the first few times but gets very old, very quickly, and could be done in another section of the DVD. The 20-minute workout probably includes 10 minutes of talking. Importantly - she does tell you how to protect yourself from injuries, many tapes don't.If you fast foward through the chatting, the workout is great - I see a visible difference, especially in my abs and hips. And especially with the killer advanced work out.Personal pet peeve - Mari's repeated use of the word ""tush"" and ""tushie"". <groan>My advice - shop around for a better bargain."
5,Great product,Perfect for storing anythng. I bought several of these and have no complaints. Just what I was looking for. Drawers are a great size just dont store anything too heavy in there I use mine for hand towels.
3,Good for price,"Item shipped quickly and package was in good shape. The container has tons of room. However, it DOES seem a bit flimsy, and constantly wobbles which makes me worried that it might topple over. It hasn't so far but it really doesn't look or feel sturdy. I bought 2 of these because I have a lot I need to store. The other cart broke! I tried to put on the wheels and moving the empty cart to another part of my room and the wheels just broke off. The cart's wheel holders were broken so I have to use it without the wheels which is disappointing."
5,Best replacement of cheap laminate drawers,"I purchases this after my two-drawer closet storage broke and was completely useless. I remember having paid the same amount last year, and this looks at least more sturdy compared to that. I like the fact that it is larger, see-through and very light. Wish I got this earlier instead of that cheap, so-called laminate closet. It was a waste."
4,Great product,It is a the second one I buy. I needed more drawers to add in the closet so this had the right size and easy to wheel it from a place to another. It can take a lot of stuff .Great value and great product .
3,Expensive,"Although these drawers hold a little less than I expected they pretty much fulfill my needs (yarn and material stashes) and fit well in my bedroom. They stack easily, too. Whereas the $19 dollar price was very attractive my gripe is that with shipping and tax (from Target) they cost well over $30 each . I wish Amazon would sell items like this directly instead of through a marketplace partner. I often look through the Target site but their shpg costs make purchases from them prohibitive for me."
1,Not sturdy at all. Good for lightweight storage only.,"I bought this to organize school work for my 3 boys. It is not sturdy at all, but would be good for lightweight storage (lighter than paper!) and it would work it you had no children near it. I had it one week when my 4 year old sat on it and the wheel broke off, unfixable, and I had to remove all the wheels to be able to use it. The weight from the draw above makes it difficult to use the drawers. Good if you are storing very lightweight things I guess (not paper!)."
3,Functional..but disappointing quality,"I bought this to organize a few magazines, promotional/marketing materials, and documents in my office and was hoping the product would live to the Sterilite standards of quality. Imagine my disappointment when I got a flimsy, poorly built cart two days later. The poor thing is SO flimsy that it keeps tipping over if I open more than one drawer at a time and the only reason I still have it is because I don't have the time or patience to return it back to Amazon for a refund. This cart may be great for holding sewing/art supplies or light kids toys, but nothing heavier than that."
4,good drawers!,"This is the perfect size to fit in my closet, and the wheels make it easy to move around. I would suggest not putting anything too heavy in the top two drawers because it's plastic and not completely sturdy. However, I do put my jeans in the bottom drawer and it's fine."
4,Get it while it's cheap,"We got two, they were such a good price. We use it for the new baby's clothes, etc. We stacked them, and the topmost drawer tends to stick because we also put stuff on top of it. That's the only flaw, that the support isn't too strong so it dips in a bit at the top. When I need to grab something, sometimes the noise wakes the baby. But as long as I remember that, it's fine.Very big, these are perfect size for storing clothes. When it gets bigger than this, the plastic will cave and it's bothersome to deal with plastic drawers when they cave in.Recommend, because they're cheap and delivered to your door!"
4,Serves its purpose.,"I received this item very quickly!It was already assembled which was a plus. All I had to place were the castors. I flipped it over to place them and noticed there was a crack in the plastic near one of the holes to place the castor. It wasn't bad enough for me to send it back and since I am using it to store my infant's clothing, I am not to worried about it falling apart under pressure. As the packaging was intact, I have to assume they sent it to me that way and not damaged en route. That is the only reason its 4 stars."
2,Too flimsy to be useful and overpriced for what you get.,"These drawers are ok, but they are fairly flimsy and not very strong, so really only good for clothes or other light items. Otherwise no issues, though a bit too expensive, I think, now that I have one in hand.Update 2012-01-15: Came back and dropped my rating from 3 to 2 stars. This thing is so flimsy it's a pain to use (drawers won't shut easily half the time). I do not recommend this, get something sturdier."
4,great product!,"i have been using the smaller size 3-drawer carts for a few years as clothing shelves and it was time to buy a bigger one for the bulkier items in my closet. this wide-sized cart is great for storing sweaters, sweatpants, etc.it fits perfectly inside my closet and it makes it so much more organized! i recommend it !"
2,Returned - Too Flimsy,This is OK if price is your first priority. I reccommend IRIS if you want greater durabilty. The drawers are much more rigid.
4,Nice,I bought these so we could have some more storage in our closet. They were easy to assemble and they do the job. The drawers kind of stick sometimes but for the most part we are satisfied with the amount of storage the cart had.
4,"Not Quite as Sturdy as Hoped, Otherwise OK","This was going to make a storage solution in my kitchen. I placed three partially-filled magazine files with cooking magazines in them on top of it immediately and put some pans in the bottom two drawers. I was ""saving"" the top drawer for future use only to find within a couple weeks the magazine files had caused the top to warp to the point that the top drawer can no longer open past the lip. I really thought Sterilite was sturdy enough to handle this type of thing. (It's not like a put my thick cookbooks up there!) I am trying to figure out how to flatten the top to make the drawer usable but have thus far not been able to. Otherwise the other two drawers open smoothly and it arrived in perfect condition."
1,Cheap Piece of Plastic,"If you buy this with the intent of storing more than 4 or 5 pounds STOP! The drawers can't support the weight and neither can the wheels. Have 2 of these and regret buying them. The wheels have no support and break if you have more than a few pounds in the drawers. Put in the extra money and get something stable, don't waste your money on these."
3,Met the need,We had another cart like this already and needed another. The castors were missing for the cart but since we were going to stack it onto and attach it to the other cart and make a six drawer cart we didn't need them.The price is very reasonable.
5,a good choice,the shipping was fast. the product and its quality are what I expected. The wheels are not very tight but do not affect the use.
5,Exactly What I Need,"I recently purchased this product to use a drawer for baby clothes. Its such a great alternative to spending close to $300 dollars for a wooden drawer. Its cheap and it does the job. Why spend more when you can get this? Another plus to this, is that once I need to get rid of baby clothes I can use it for storage in the garage or basement. Great product!"
4,It Works Fine,I wish the top of it was sturdier and didn't sag in so easily from the weight of a few products or an alarm clock. But it works fine for storage. It's larger and holds much more than I anticipated and that's most important.
5,EXCELLENT,Very fast shipping and a nice sturdy product. Fits perfect under our kitchen counter and use it for extra storage in the kitchen. Wheels work very well and nice and sturdy for everyday use. Will be buying another one in the future!!
1,disappointing,"I was really hoping to use this item for my crafting supplies. However, the frame does not support, well, anything heavier than clothing. I had scrap-booking supplies in this item and the wheels broke off. I could understand that if I had filled it with paper or something heavier but it had inks and stamp pads and markers and other not-so-heavy items along with some paper and the wheels still broke off. The first one came off the first few days I had the cart. The second was about a week later. The drawers aren't easy to open or close since the frame is so flimsy.I originally make this purchase because of all the great reviews, and now I feel both cheated and baffled. Also, I need to go find something sturdier now."
2,over priced,"I wouldn't buy these from amazon, even though I like buying from amazon...Walmart has the same ones online for 19 bucks, and you can ship to store for free shipping...[...]"
4,Good,It can store all the light products. Easy to operate and easy to move. Not for heavy stuff. I stored kids small toys.
2,Drawers won't close.,"I'm giving this two stars instead of one because after ten years, these carts are still useable, sort of. We bought them to store our son's Legos and K'Nex. They worked fine for that purpose, and he liked that he could roll them around to where he was building something. When he outgrew his toys, I ""borrowed"" these units to store craft supplies, because they fit neatly beneath the lowest shelf in my craft closet. I did not store heavy items in them, but discovered that after opening the lower drawers, you can't get them to close again without pulling out the unit and physically lifting the drawer back onto its little seat. This is inconvenient and is some kind of design flaw. I have replaced them with new, narrower drawer units which work much better and hold a lot more stuff more efficiently -- just a better solution for me."
5,Good,Good storage piece and hasnt fallen apart yet like a lot of these things do. I wish it was cheaper because it is just plastic after all
5,Perfect Storage Unit,"This is the second of these I have bought. They are great size, durable, strong and easy to clean product. I keep it in my closet and keep all my accessories such as belts and scarves in it. I don't use the wheels but I imagine they can be super helpful for those that need to move this piece around. I highly suggest it this product."
3,rickety and misshapen,I bought it for my toddlers clothes and thought if it was nice enough I would buy a few more. I thought it would be good for bathroom organization but I am not so sure now. It seems like if you put anything heavy into it then it wouldn't function well... top drawer filled with baby clothes almost tipped the whole thing over when opened.
5,Wide drawers,The drawers are wide and deep. There is also a system in place to prevent the drawers from sliding all the way out off of their tracks.
4,Organization on a big scale from Amazon.com,I'm so tired of rummaging through boxes looking for things in my closet. This wide cart really fills the bill. I stored like items in each of the 3 drawers and in so doing opened up floor space in my closet. No more tripping over small boxes and loose items. Everything is neatly stored away and I can see what's in each drawer without opening it. I really think another one is in my future. Amazon.com to the rescue.
3,perfect but broken,"I ordered two pieces of this Sterilite product because it's cheap and spacious at the same time. However, when I am wiping the whole plastic piece I noticed that the first drawer layer is actually cracked, which actually you will not be able to notice because it was taped on the opposite end as its packaging. i was trying to retrieve the info of the seller but I can not find the merchant's info. I just wish that they could send me a replacement for the drawer because everything is perfectly okey except for that drawer."
4,What i expected.,"Looks good and sturdy, just what i expected to see for this product. Probably last forever as long as you dont beat it."
2,"weak plastic cannot hold heavy items, should be around $18","I bought this exactly product at Walmart for $18 (regular, not a roll back price). I can see why Amazon sells for double the price because you are actually paying for packaging and shipping. Sterilite made this drawers with different width. The ones that is not too wide as this works a little better. I only use this one to store baby clothes, towels next to the changing table because I can see it at the store the plastic will not hold anything heavy. The sliding drawers are not smooth after you put stuff in it. When it is totally empty they slide fine. I put a radio digital clock on top of the drawers and over time the top started to bend so the top drawer cannot close all the way. I am getting this for short term use so this work for me for couple of years."
3,practical but uncomfortable,"excellent choice for putting away my craft supplies, but it is uncomfortable to open the drawers unless you hold the unit with the other hand"
4,Good Product,"It is useful and practical. However, if you overload it, you need to get rid of the wheels. It holds a lot of stuff. I would recommend it."
2,Sterilite 29308001 3-Drawer Wide Cart,"This is a very light weight duty kind of cart. You can't put something on top of the cart or else it will warp, you hardly open/close the drawer. I regret that I didn't check it out at Walmart first, besides, it's much cheaper at Walmart only $17.98."
1,Most Horrible Cart I ever saw,"This is the first time I have ever returned an item to Amazon in all the years I have been shopping here. This cart arrived damaged and used, it was covered in animal hair, sticky glue and had four broken holes where the wheels were supposed to go, one wheel didnt even match the other 3. I will never buy another item from Sterilite again. The good news is Amazon arranged for it to be picked up immediately and will refund my money that I spent for this."
1,Broke instantly,"Take heed that this flimsy excuse for a cart can only handle the lightest items. Even software discs caused it to become top heavy and tip over.One of the casters broke its flimsy insertion point on the second day, and this ended up in the trashas a total and complete waste of money."
2,Looks sturdier than it actually is,"This storage tower is only suitable for very LIGHTWEIGHT items. I bought this to hold paper instruction manuals and once I had the drawers more than half-full they started to sag. With all 3 drawers closed it is functional but don't expect to be opening and closing it when it's got stuff in all 3 sections. Even rolling it around at that point was an issue since the drawers can 'deform' the frame as it rolls around. I did a lot of rearranging (heavier papers in the bottom drawer) to see whether it made much difference---nope! Might be an inexpensive solution for excess underwear, socks, or ties, but not anything heavier."
2,OK for lightweight storage,"This is a relatively decent storage option, provided you're only storing lightweight items. It does *not* hold heavyweight items well - if too much weight is in the drawers, the drawers will not open. You also cannot put much weight on the top before it bends and obstructs the opening of the top drawer. However, these are remarkably inexpensive, and if you don't have heavy things to store, are worthwhile. Personally, I would have paid more for a more substantial storage solution if I had realized the limited use of these drawers."
3,Decent drawers for extra storage but beware the price!,"I wouldn't say that these drawer carts are of the best quality compared to other brands, but their size is adequate for some extra closet storage. We use them in the office for a variety purposes and at home for extra clothes. Their height makes them easy to roll under most tables and under the hanging clothes. However, they can't withstand anything extremely heavy or the drawer will warp or not pull out properly.My warning is that you can find these at another mainstream store for 50% cheaper than Amazon currently. Price check before you buy because these are definitely not worth paying more than $10 to $15!"
5,serves it's purpose,"I use one in my closet for shoes and one for gift wrap, bags etc., closet is tidy and now there is more space."
4,Practical & good for the price...,"We bought two units to stack on top of one another like a tall dresser (you just remove one of the top lids & attach). We're using it for baby clothes and it's working perfectly. My one complaint would be that the drawers don't always slide out smoothly (thus, 4 instead of 5 stars). Otherwise, this has been a great functional & economical alternative to real furniture."
4,This is amazing,I love these drawers! I bought 4 when it was sold by amazon with free shipping. I found that Walmart is selling them for $20 lately. I bought another 4!! They are durable and spacious. They are also easy to move so it's perfect for seasonal clothes. We piled some up against the wall and reduced some to 2 drawers to fit under the coat closet. Everything is so organized now with such a little cost!!
3,"Great for lighter items, can't use for heavier things","For the price of around $17, this drawers are good enough to hold lighter items, such as clothes, shoes, etc. I bought this for sorting out tool clutters in the garage, and although they are still somehow holding them okay, drawer sunk and that cause the drawer to stuck when opening it. Push here and there in order to pull the drawer to be out, which is sometimes a hustle. Since the size of these drawers are pretty large, this sinking drawer problem is eminent for heavier items."
1,I liked how it looked but...,"I liked how this teakettle looked. It did take a little while to figure out how to flip up the whistling cap and keep it up. (As a side note, the whistle is very soft until it's almost ready to boil over). My problem is that the enamel on the bottom is chipping horribly and worsens every time I use it. So, I'm in the market for a new kettle already."
3,leaves a lot to be desired,"Not as bad as the preceding reviewer, but still pretty dumb. Bought it because it was published by the same people who put out the brilliant ""Ultimate Japanese"", but this falls very short. There are words in there that don't appear in any of my dictionaries - moora(?) fr instance - and too many Englishifications. We know the Japanese use these, just give me the Japanese equivalent - that's what I'm trying to learn!Also, if you're aiming for a high level of Japanese, you're going to have to learn Kanji. Romaji won't take you beyond kitchen Japanese."
5,Shaun The Sheep speaks all languages,"Shaun The Sheep is an excellent series for all ages! Like the original Tom and Jerry cartoons, there is no dialogue. This makes a great gift for for young children who are just learning English, or for anyone who enjoys claymation sight gags."
3,"Great show, not annoying like many kid shows.","I got a couple of copies of this for some of my friends, after watching an episode with one of my friends. Unlike so many children's shows, this one draws them in, and isn't over the top, or encouraging of bad behavior. The kids engage with it but not in the loud and obnoxious way the engage with many other programs."
2,"Great show, horrible DVD","This is a great British series but when it was released in America the decided to crop all of the Widescreen episodes into 4:3 pan & scan. In the UK you can buy it in Widescreen, but here they refuse to release it in its proper format. It is also unavailable in Blu-Ray in either country for some reason. If you haven't seen it it is still worth getting, but it is a real shame that they had to ruin the presentation. Hopefully they will come out with it in Blu-Ray widescreen."
2,Unnecessarily Huge Box and Pan and Scan Video,"Received this today as a gift. Was first disappointed to see that they used an unnecessarily large double-wide DVD case for this release. It's such a waste of space on the shelf. However, I was devastated to look at the back and discover this was presented in 1.33:1 FULL FRAME. This show is aired in 16:9 widescreen in the UK and released in that format there. I (maybe stupidly) assumed they would release it the same way here in the US. Such a disappointment--this show deserves a better release. Will keep my fingers crossed for a corrected blu-ray release."
1,WTH????,"Cannot play this on either DVD player or Blue Ray player??? Other than that my son loves Shaun The Sheep, he keeps asking me to let him watch it :-("
2,Shaun the sheep,"Leave it to the Brits to screw up on the formatting. Go on netflix and view it there, you will have better viewing."
2,Not nearly the quality of Wallace and Gromit,Owning all of the Wallace and Gromit vids I thought for sure that this would be as funny and charming because Shaun was a character from 'A close shave'. I was wrong. These episodes are tedious and much less funny. My whole family enjoys W&G but Shaun the series just doesn't live up to the standard set by it's predecessor. I won't be tuning in for another season.
5,Fun Show!!,"We stumbled across this show on Netflix Instant Play. So, on Thanksgiving we watched the entire first season! (lol) My husband and I really like it...there is practiacally no dialog, so it's fun to see what can be conveyed without it! Plus the claymation is very good!! My children laughed many many times! It's a great little show!"
4,waiting for widescreen blu-ray,"Great episodes! However, Lionsgate is incredibly lame for releasing mostly cropped versions of something that's so visually creative. I just watched the ""Party Animals"" DVD, which is the first of these I've seen in widescreen ... I noticed all sorts of things that normally would have been cropped out, like the dog's name on his dish. (""He has a name?"") I'd buy this in a minute if the DVDs got the widescreen treatment the material deserves. Until then, we're checking them out of the library whenever we need a fix. Lionsgate, we give you a fat big sheep raspberry."
1,misleading,"The chapstick itself gets 5stars works great I live by it, the picture is misleading, it gives you the impression you are getting all three not just one..."
5,It works!!!,I started getting cold sores about two years ago. I found Super Lysine Plus Coldstick (Strawberry and Tangerine are best) and use nightly before bed. I have not had a cold sore since using this product. Also anything you can do to boost your immune system will help also.
5,From Dust and Ashes: A Story of Liberation,I was inspired by the deep historical information and the wonderful God sent hope in what would seem to be the worst scenario. All is possible through Jesus and this story shows how faith gets us through. I recommend this book to everybody!
1,Extremely disappointing,"This book had the opportunity to be a very inspiring story, however about half way through it became a Christian testament. Anyone outside of the Christian faith was portrayed as either total evil or hapless lambs. Apparently, there was no strength exhibited unless you gave yourself to Christ. Very little is mentioned about those Christians who actively worked throughout the war, putting their lives at risk, to help. Our 'heroine' looked the other way during the war and reaped the benefits of being SS until things changed. At the end of the book I felt the author, with all of her research trips, missed the opportunity to fulfill the promise of the setup of the story. I felt like I was promised one story line and halfway through it totally changed. VERY DISAPPOINTING! A missed opportunity by the author."
3,beautifully written,"This was recommended to me by a friend. As a rule I don't read novels, only strictly history, but this offered an insight into what happened to the communities around a concentration camp. Very well written, although I would love to know what exactly was based on facts."
4,Really liked it!!,"Yes, it had a Christian aspect to the story, most of these FREE Kindle books do. I just try to look beyond that. I was really drawn to the storyline. I connected well with the characters. I became very interested in the history. It was a horrible time and I was grateful to have the opportunity to learn about the history, at the same time, read an entertaining story. I would definatly reccommend this story to others."
3,"Promising plot, forced spirituality","The author's descriptions of the aftermath of the holocaust were gripping and enough to give me nightmares (in a good way... if that makes any sense). It prompted me to do a little more research for myself, becoming temporarily obsessed with the time period and the stories of holocaust survivors. I did become attached to each of the characters and had high hopes for where the story might take me.I was a little disappointed. Some questions were never answered and I think the story took some unnecessary turns that weakened the plot that readers had already become attached to.As a Christian, I didn't mind that the book was meant to have some spiritual undertones. BUT... I did find that although the author tried to hint at God throughout the beginning of the book, it took such a heavy handed turn towards the end that it felt forced to me. It takes away from the strength of any message she might have been trying to send. It's too bad."
4,Highly recommended.,I found this to be a very touching and inspirational story. My only reason for not giving it five stars is because the last few chapters kind of beat you over the head with the religious aspect of the story -- like we might not get it otherwise.
5,You Won't Want To Stop Reading!,"Why did I cry when I read From Dust and Ashes? Because Tricia Goyer's novel made me feel the raw emotions experienced by so many during the liberation of a Nazi Concentration camp. Along with Helene, I feel in love with Peter, an American Soldier and I empathized with Michaela, a concentration camp survivor, as she tried to go home again. Through the characters - I lived this story. Thank you, Tricia!"
4,Loved it,"Thoroughly gripping story about WWII victims and survivors. Makes you realize that even some of the SS wives were victims, even while living in the lap of luxury.Beautifully told with endearing characters. You pull for Helene. You hope for Sgt Scoot to find love. You adore the kids and Helene's dad and you realise that God is always in control, even in the worst circumstances. You also learn forgiveness, even when you don't feel like forgiving and you think the person shouldn't be forgiven."
2,great potential but ultimately failed,"This book had such great potential. The first half was wonderful. Great story. Written well. Really drew me in. I would give the first half 4 or 5 stars. The second half of the book is like an entirely different book. It was almost like a sermon. Someone else mentioned the 700 club. I mean at one point almost every page was talking about finding Christ and this book is supposed to be about the plight of Jews? It seemed to me the author used the Jewish story as a ruse to lure people in and then present the real reason she wrote the book. The two halves of the book were just that different. It got so bad I finally had to quit reading and I never do that. It just wasnt any good anymore. I would give the second half of the book a 0 or 1/2 star if I could. A shame, it really had great potential."
1,"Posted a comment, but wanted to record my disappoint in a review","I posted a longer comment as a response to another review, but realized that doesn't register a rating for me. This is a well written book that takes a sad turn in the middle to become just another book promoting Christian religion. Ironic that the setting is one where Jews and other non-Christians are being systematically exterminated ... and yet the story focuses on the moral struggles of someone who stood by and did nothing. See my other comment for more."
2,First and second half deserve different ratings,"I agree with others who point out how the beginning of the book is good but the latter part takes a turn for the worse as the religious messaging becomes blunt and distracting. I decided to read this because I have an interest in World War II that goes back several decades to my pre-teen years. I've consumed as many non-fiction sources as I could get my hands on and set aside time to read or watch, and have watched some ""historical fiction"" movies, so I thought I'd try a historical fiction book, especially since it was presented as a well-researched work focusing on the aftermath in Europe, which is not something I've read much about. I gathered that there might be a religious element to the story, but I did not expect the focus to shift so much to that. The first part was a reasonably enjoyable read, but the second part left me with a negative overall view of the book. I only finished it because I don't like leaving books unfinished."
1,a story of 700 club,"It sounds like a story told by Pat Roberson in a 700 club gathering. It glorifies Christianity , slights other religions. Christians were the heroes and saviors, and Jews were the victims. Christians were strong, Jews were weak, and atheists were the devils. It ignored the basic human natures of good and evil that beyond any religion.The whole novel barely mentions the faith of Jews, which they held on so dearly and drew strength during their horrific treatment by the Nazis.The plots were predictable and by no mean intriguing. I was disappointed."
3,"Started off one way, then took a turn","I was really expecting a ""fictionalized historical"" type of book, and for about the first half, that's what I had. Then it seemed as if a different writer took over, and it became a Christian Romance book.I did enjoy it, and I don't mind CF. I typically don't read reviews before reading a book because I want to make up my own mind, so I didn't see the other comments about this issue. This book was OK, but I felt it was a tad misrepresented in the description."
4,Good story & well written,"I enjoyed each of the character's stories entertwined within the plot. Believable Christian fiction. Would read more from this author. I get a little frustrated at the negative reviews saying the story was too ""preachy"". Obviously they don't get the connection."
3,Good story that gets side-tracked,"This is a good World War II story, obviously well researched and planned which handles the freeing of prisoners at the end of the war.I do agree with other reviewers that after the first third of the book, the author introduces some heavy christian themes and plots, and after going back and looking at some reviews of Tricia Goyer's books I realize that had I done that first I'd have known to expect this ""surprise"".I stuck with the book and was able to enjoy the story for what it was. The religious theme is really not my thing but it was only one of many aspects the author addressed and it didn't ruin my enjoyment of the main story.It did seem like the story got side tracked at certain points because of the addition of the religious theme although I'm sure that was her intent, just once or twice it seemed to be shoe-horned in there unnecessarily.All in all this is still a good read, well written and enjoyable."
2,Disappointing,This plot was interesting for quite a while until it suddenly turned into a Christian evangelizing theme. The plot was buried. Sorry i just could not finish the book.
3,Good Premise,"I thought the premise was interesting which is why I downloaded the book. I enjoyed the first 3/4 of the story story but the last 1/4 was predictable and had no depth. It was as if the writer, an American Christian let her own religious beliefs take over the center of the story instead of the characters renewel and growth.When I finished the book I simply put it down moving on to my next read. I judge a great book by one that stays with me and I become connected to the character. Not this one..."
4,Great album to own for a lesser price,"This is a very fun album for fans of Disney and bands named after nutritious vegetables.I have to admit, I picked up this CD because I saw Andrew WK on it. Andrew WK's cover of the Mickey Mouse Club March sounds just like every other song he does with screaming, heavy guitars and banging keyboards. Just like I expected.You get rock, J-Pop, punk, noise, and ska bands all covering Disney songs. From Reel Big Fish's rendition of ""It's Not Easy"" from Pete's Dragon to Smash Mouth's cover of ""I Wanna Be Like You"" from the Jungle Book, it's a great listen.Is the album worth the hefty price listed here? Probably not. It's a great compilation to own, however in the end it's a novelty."
2,Dangerous to wearer,"I still think it is adorable and that is why I bought it, but I put it in and it was extremely sharp on the rose petals. By the next day, It had cut into my skin and every time that I sat down it caused great pain. By the time I went to take it out two days later the red on the rose had begun to fade and was staining my skin. Overall, not a good experience."
3,Will the real Kate Wolf please stand up?,"This is a fine debut album of a certain sort. For those like me, however, who assumed it was by the original, one and only, clear-voiced, honest and plain-spoken singer-songwriter-poet, the late Kate Wolf, it is a gross disappointment. Some of us think the earlier Kate Wolf the finest realistic folk lyricist of the past 30 years. A previous reviewer's incautious suggestion that the original Kate Wolf may have postumously usurped the identity of this later artist can most charitably be viewed as an unguarded malappropism. While I would not attribute any but the best of motives to this interesting young artist using her own name, I must also echo the honest, plainly-stated sentiments of the ORIGINAL Kate Wolf's son, Max Wolf, in his review of this album--don't make the same mistake I did."
3,Not half bad,"I love tri color spirals and this brand is pretty good. I liked that it's USDA organic and I got a deal on warehouse, however they don't always stay together in shipping. And this is a thicker spiral so it can easilly be under or over cooked."
2,Poorly substantied tripe,"I bought this book hoping that is would be a well researched and supported overview of the development of the diagnosis for Munchausen By Proxy Syndrome. Unfortunately, it did not deliver. I wanted backround and research to support it, but none was forthcoming. The authors write mainly from the philsophical point of view and do not bother to examine whether MBPS is a valid diagnosis based on case study or clinical research. Many MBPS mothers endorse this book because they believe that it vidicates them, however, the mere overdiagnosis of a disorder does not prove it's nonexistance. A reader interested in this subject would do better to read Marc Feldman's book ""Patient or Pretender"" and/or review the joural articles on Medline. Buy a book about Factitious Disorders that has a more substantial foundation than this book does that is founded on research not supposition. This book is a waste for serious MSBP researchers. Pass."
1,Annoyingly Loud Music,"The background music in this video is annoyingly loud. If Voltaire were alive today, he would make fun of this kind of incompetence. To vastly improve the video, its producers should either get rid of the background music or turn it down."
5,Provides vision and hope.,"An elegant and beautiful book. It was both visionary and poetic, like Muir, and offers us a fine, new appreciation of the man and his message in this time of political and environmental degradation. Stunning photographs."
4,A splendid biography,"This is Ehrlich's gift to the memory of John Muir. Not technical. Not analytical. Simply a descriptive outline of Muir's fascinating life graced with numerous fascinating photos. This is a National Geographic volume that is perfect for someone wanting a light, inspired read of Muir's life."
3,"Beware, these are ""stereo"" re-recordings","This CD looked interesting, but when I got it, it is like elevator music, and all of the selections, except one are later re-recordings, presumably by the same artists. The sound is very good, but be aware you are not buying the original, classic recordings of these selections."
3,Not ALL Remakes,"I agree with Robert about the numerous remakes, but the Percolator Twist is original, and it appears in not so often heard Stereo."
5,New Balance Crew Socks,Great performance. Stands up to repeated washings and still performs like new. Great support for high arches. I would definitely purchase these again.
4,"Striking, original, off-kilter and so pleasing","Splendid, very modernist take on latin (afro-cuban?) jazz, with an emphasis on harmonic and rhythmic freedom; kind of ""out"" as it were, and very exciting. Unstoppable, high-energy thrill-fest; is that too subjective? Get this -it's well worth your money. PS: saw her live many years ago, still can't believe what I heard!"
4,I can't believe no one's reviewed this album!,"I logged in here today to read reviews of this album, and I can't believe that there's no review! This is an EXCELLENT album! Do listen to some of the track samples on this page. There were two albums by this band and they're both very good. I pass them on to my friends and they all say, hey, what? Why haven't we heard of this? Well, they don't, really, since this album was written right when low-fi music was really coming into its own. It's well-written, the music is really well done and sounds great. I'm reading this review, and I'm a lame reviewer. But I love this album."
2,Buyer Beware!,"Unfortunately, not all the films on this DVD are in good condition. BLOOD AT SUNDOWN comes from a VHS copy that has been preserved on DVD before tape drop ruins it entirely. SARTANA ANGEL OF DEATH freezes ten minutes before the end and, as another post has noted, one Hunt Powers version has been recorded from TV with the channel logo clearly visible on the right bottom and is also cropped like the first."
2,The Complete Saga,"If your expecting high qulaity films the you have come to the wrong place cause you will not find any in this collection. I thought I knew what letterbox video was till I watched the first 2 films on disk 2, also so films taken from VHS as you have the video roll, and even the dirty heads with no picture in some of these film. If your a spagetti Western film collector what can yuou do,. this is just the nature of the beast. Added to my collection, but if I wasn't a collector and just a watcher I would pass this deal up unless I cam across it in the 3 dollar bin. (1-28-13)"
1,More truth twisting to add to the confusion,"This author's ""technique"" for determining the truth is to take two extremes, find the ""middle ground"" and proclaim that as the ""truth"".Everyone seems to know that ""two wrongs don't make a right"", that is except for Dr. Dixon.If you want to find out the truth about drugs, I certainly do not recommend this book.If you can locate a copy, I recommend: Licit and Illicit Drugs; The Consumers Union Report. Buy a book based on facts, not opinions labeled as truths."
5,Creative Impressions Review,"Superbly written and down to earth...Congratulations to Tu-Shonda Whitaker!!! ""Flip Side of the Game"" is not your average ""TCP"" novel. This heartwarming story will have you laughing and crying out for more. The main characters: Vera is so real, Taj is a woman's dream, and Aunt Cookie and Uncle Boy (you'll find each of them in everyone's family). ""Flip Side"" is a page turner and a must read."
2,Ummmm Notttt,"This book is actually not at all what i expected it to be! It was a big dissapointment. It seems as if the author jumps from plot to plot. Though i didnt think it was a great book i could definately see the potential, and would give part two a try with hopes of improvement on the writters behalf."
2,Try again..,The book was ok...but not developed enough in story....I would like to see what this writer will do next...this book was just not her jump-off.....sorry.
1,Pretty Good Read,"I was pleasantly suprised by this book, its not your typical hood book. It was overall a pretty good read. I would give it 3.5 stars."
1,Tried tooooo hard....,"I personally did not really care for this book. It was not a page turner and the only reason I finished it was because I didn't have another to read at the time. I was very disappointed. The main character came off as trying toooo hard to be ""down."" I really couldn't get into this book."
5,Da Bomb,"This book was fantastic! I met Tu-Shonda this weekend in the bookstore and I have to say you go girl! I this book held my attention from beginnging to end. You gave us an excellent story and all I want is more. Vera touched me on many different levels and Taj, well he was just perfect. Only one question, can someone ask Ms. Whitaker to do one more."
4,The Second one's better,"I really didnt think the book would go like that, but i was very happy there is not one thing i would change, it was all perfect. What I really liked was how Taj wasn't a hustler or drug dealer, or something would have made him be married to the streets. You could get the second part (Game over) to know what happened but you really dont need to."
5,oh my god this was a good one,this book was a page turner. I couldnt put it down I read this book in 2days
3,Flip the words around or correct the errors!,"I would like to start off by saying this was one of our book clubs choices and one major complaint was the editing. I know things are not perfect but TRIPLE CROWN you guys got to get it together! This is not the first book that I read published by this company and the editing was bad. I am not one to look at a book and critique the errors, misspelled words, and grammar. But come on you guys. You can't hold the crown if you don't have the ability to publish a book without errors! With that said I think this book was a good read. I found myself crying because I could relate to the main character. It also had parts that had me laughing out loud. As for the character Taj I hope there is a man out there for me like this guy he was great!"
4,"Humorous, fast paced... Excellence!","Well people sometimes I feel like I'm the only author who gives others the respect they deserve. I write reviews for my Literary Hood Column (IBCmag, so I guess its the old can't teach new dogs different stuff syndrome).Tu did an excellent job at taking the forever shakey ground of urban fiction, turning it into a wonderful entertaining coaster ride. This book is Six Flags... a purchase well worth the money and something even my fantastic mind enjoyed as I turned the pages. I shant give anything away, read it, realize that Tu is here for the long haul and stay tuned for the sequal novel (its right around the corner).Tu continue to give the masses the same thing you started your career with, wonderful stuff......I'm proud of you.oh P.S. the midget gave this book mad flavor, bananas!!! Put that guy in the second installment, or else!"
5,Can You Handle It?,"I was absolutely taken by this novel's substance of love. It was hard for Vera to accept being loved by the heart of Taj. Being this was something out of the norm for her, she did the only thing she knew to do...push him away. This novel is filled with love, lust, and loneliness. I really, really enjoyed this story. This is one that should be a part of your library...NJ"
5,Great Work,This was a wonderful story and I was very impressed with this first time author. I was able to relate to the main character Vera in so many ways. I hope this author makes a sequel to this book and gives us more of we're looking for. Much success!
2,Yo Can I Keep It Real!!!!!!!!!,"This was a very underdeveloped story with many editing errors that Triple Crown is famous for. I must say though the cover was beautiful,but like I was always told don't judge a book by it's cover. I don't know what book the other reviewers were reading but I just didn't see the greatness in it. The author shouldn't get discouraged because the start of the book started of with a bang and then just fizzled out. Anyway those of you who know me knows I keep it real when it comes to my reviews. TAKE THIS ONE OUT OF THE LIBRARY. PEACE"
3,Ms Gerry,"The story was ok, just too repetitive, let's get over the dumpster. I bought this book because of the pages I was able to preview on-line, but when I got it I was truely disappointed. But like I said, the story did take shape and I read the sequel. I give this book 3 stars for the effort."
2,Outdated information,"Alot of speculation has come out in the recent months about why ebay suspends sellers, but one thing is sure...it isn't the same game anymore. Several other websites including http://www.ebaysucks.com, http://www.auctionwatch.com mention concern over the recent account suspensions that are unwarranted.This author gives some good information, but it is extremely outdated. Any time you buy a hard copy, it's going to be at least a year out of date, especially when dealing with an ever changing company like ebay. Not to mention he doesn't even get into the ""real world"" aspects of ebaying.Other websites like http://ebaysuspension.ezguidebooks.com give much more detailed, relevant and current information. I recommend the author check out those sites and update his book."
4,Tight Sounds!!!,This is pretty tight and different....Definitley would say give this a sample..........A different side of hiphop.
4,Not bad for a Brit,"It's a sad day in the US when we have to go overseas to find rappers who rhyme over good beats. Not that anything on this album is mind blowing, but it's a solid effort with decent lyrics and good, soulful beats based around samples that remind you of golden age hiphop.Even though he's white, he does a convincing job rhyming about the projects. I guess in London they call them council estates. Oh, those cheeky Brits. What will they think of next?"
4,Believable,"I had a hard time putting into words how I feel about One True Thing. This is a believable movie about one families' struggle to battle their mother's cancer. Through their journey they were able to come closer as a family and learn more about each other....until the end where they learn the one true thing.I really think that Meryl Streep did a fantastic job at playing Kate, the mother. It was almost life-like.If anyone has ever seen anyone struggle with a disease, they can identify with this movie. Be forewarned, tissues are a must. :-("
4,If you like terrific acting and believable characters/see it,"This is a wonderful movie to see if you enjoy great acting and character development. Not a particularly ""happy"" story line, but neither is it especially depressing, since you know up front that Meryl Streep's character will die. A superb acting (and reacting) performance by Meryl's daughter."
3,Please read the book,"Although the acting is very fine, this movie does an injustice to the book. The book is the story of Ellen's developing awareness, and is told very subtly. Before her mother's illness, Ellen had been seeing the world through her father's eyes. In the process of bonding with her mother, she develops a much deeper view of herself, her parents, their life as a family, and of how she intends to live. The movie comes close to reducing this complex story to a morality tale espousing the beauty of traditional feminine virtues, and makes what should be a subtle story a nearly black and white one. The problem is not that the movie differs from the book; it's that the movie fundamentally distorts the book's meaning."
5,Excellent!,"This is a great movie with great actors!!Very touching story about a family which struggles through in their own way, and as we find out in the end they have done the best they can considering the circumstances. William Hurt, Renee Zilweger and Meryl Streep shine in this one. Love and honesty are big themes in this picture."
1,The book was better!,"This tale of mother/daughter relations and the misunderstandings that stem from the generation gaps was a wonderful book. It will make you cry. The movie, to be succinct, won't. Read the book and skip the movie."
1,Terrible,"Plot was very real. It happens to a lot of families who suffer heart wrenching problems. The storyline was promising and I have no doubt in Streep and Hurt's convincing and compelling portrayal of characters.Renee Z., however, killed everything! Her acting was terrible that it was painful watching her in each scene that she was in (which was most of the movie)."
2,Depressing,"Alright, I love Meryl Streep, but this movie was too sad, too slow, and just plain BORING! Maybe I didn't like it because the subject matter hit too close to home, but it just kind of dragged on, and the dialoge didn't help. If you like weepy movies that will make you cry, then this should be your thing. I for one, just couldn't take it. I'll have an action movie over this rubbish any day."
3,Book is better,"Although I love Meryl Streep, I am puzzled by her Minnie Mouse portrayal of the dying mom. Absent were the layered surprises, for in the book her daughter discovers a more complex human being. This mom had the complxity of a paper towel. The movie's mom-as-Vassar-girl was at odds with the non college educated character in the book: The class issues where the daughter fancies herself intellectual superior to her mother was the centerpiece of the novel. This would have been a story worth telling, but Hollywood apparently could not resist larding up the film with images of Spode china and Chanel-suited Stepford neighbor ladies that seemed almost comical. By the way, in the book - The One True Thing is between a mother and daugher, not a feckless husband."
4,Very unusual but.....,"Normally when I read a book AND see a movie taken from it, I prefer the book to the movie (if I liked either one) In the case of One True Thing-- I preferred the movie because the book text was constantly reminding you what an acheiver Ellen Gulden was which I thought to be a tad uneccessary. I found myself thinking ""I GET the point already, come on!"" In the movie version, Ellen is also smart and successful, but this is shown to us without hitting us over the head with it."
5,"One, true great movie","This movie has it right even before we know what it's about just by the casting itself. When you have an amazing cast like Meryl Streep, Wiliam Hurt and Renee Zelwegger etc 9 times out of ten you can't go wrong. Then when we do find out what the story to this movie is we realise just how wonderful it is. There's no need to give a synopsis of this film considering Amazon do it for us but I wanted to rate this movie to advise anyone who hasn't seen this film to rent it immediately. If you like a movie with real human emotion, realistic storylines and fantastic acting this is the film to watch."
5,One of my favorite movies,"My friends wonder how I can watch this movie so man times when it is so sad. I think it is one of the most perfectly made movies ever. The cinematography is evocative and nostalgic, the performances are unparalleled, especially by Streep and the incredibly underrated Zellweger, and the story is family and life affirming. There are so many scenes that are perfect like the tre lighting scene and the Minnie Carnival Scene and especially Kate's poignant speech to her daughter about love and accepting flaws. This movie is classic, underrated, and exceptional."
4,one crazy pig,I had seen the movie Pig Hunt so I wanted to see an earler version of the same premise. I think there always will be a medium sized market for films on cryptozological giants.
2,Snore!!,"At 1 and a half hours, it's about 20 minutes to long. How many shots of the Autrailian outback do we really need to see? The best thing about the film is the giant pig uh....ok....razorback. In the brief time you see it, it looks fairly impressive. But those times are few and far between. It reminded me of one of those movies of the week. Certainly seen better."
1,A REAL STINK-A-ROO,"This has got to be one of the worst, if not the worst movie I have ever seen up to now in my lifetime.It is a rip off of ""Jaws"" using instead of a shark a wild boar in the Australian outback. In one of the scenes you won't be able to stop laughting as the boar eats through the jeep and devours the people inside of it.With that said I guess if you're drunk or stoned, anything can be enjoyed and you can laugh up this one for real.If you want a good horror story please don't purchse this move. It's as laughable and rediculous as ""Van Helsing"". Now you use your own judegement. The last and final warning, this movie will never, never, never be on anyone's list for restoration."
5,The best giant boar movie ever made,"If you have seen pig hunt or chawz and never have seen Razorback, then you are truly missing out on a gem of the 80's. Scary, good SPFX, and a vision of Australia I have never seen before. These people make the guy in Wolf Creek look like Santa Claus. Beautifully directed and crafted, great performances all around, please don't miss this feature in your collection."
5,LOVE Montignac!,One of the few books I love because of the simple breakdown of recipes & how the diet works. Lost 45 lbs in under a month but still ate freat food & opened up my palate to new foods & combinations of flavors.
4,This game rocks !,"This is an awesome game. It has the best graphics I have ever seen and has really cool music. If I could have, I would have given it 10 stars. This is a very cool game and I would recomend it to anyone."
3,A Pleasent Suprise from Majesco!,"I had heard about Iridion (the first) and didn't really feel like getting it. I had heard that you couldn't see where you were aiming shots and many negative things. I didn't really expect Iridion 2 to be much better...but believe me...I was wrong...-----------------------Storyline = 3.5/5 Aliens are invading, just like 100 yearsago. Can YOU save the world?Graphics = 4.5/5 Very well done. Gives out a 3D feel, butnot annoyingly like Iridion 1Interest = 3/5 This was a definate weak-spot of Iridion2, it doesn't keep you're interest. It'sfun, but the whole type of play is thesame all game. It gets boring eventually.Reccomend = 3.7/5 I don't think this is the best game I'veever seen. They did the best they could,but it's the same thing again and again.-----------------------Overall, this game was pretty good. But, like I said, it gets boring after awhile. It's not your average StarFox game (which are great), but it's not you're average Barney game!"
5,Fantastic game!,"Wow, this game is dope. Its a shoot-em-up type of game with futuristic setting. The graphics and effect is super awesome, best I've seen for GBA. The sound/music is great too! The control and variety of weapons is solid. The gameplay is totally awesome and fast! Music is excellent! It feels like you are playing a REAL flying arcade shooting game, HUGE feeling from the tiny GBA, WOW! It feels 3-D even though its a 2-D game. Highly recommended!"
5,Fun in the water!,"My 3 children LOVE this toy! It glides under water much easier than the Toypedoes. Also, I like it better than those because it comes back up to the top of the pool once it stops swimming so you do not have to go under water to retrieve it. Unfortunately, I bought mine locally and paid 4 times as much as Amazon's price. Now I am going to buy 4 more so each of us will have one to play with. I think that will make for great racing games in the pool."
2,2nd one in less than 3 years,"They just seem to 'die' on me. It's really rather frustrating which is the only reason I""m writing this because I'm so mad right now. My second one just stopped responding and every 5 minutes I have to reestablish the connection between the mouse and the wireless unit. Like really, this is pathetic. I'm running a IO Gear KVM switch using 2 Macs (mind you I did have another IO Gear KVM completely die on me). Anyway I plugged in my bulky Kensington Expert Mouse (wired) and it works no problem.So 2 things,1. This must be a flaw with Logitech Wireless Trackballs on Macs using KVM switches2. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER LOGITECH WIRELESS MOUSE.For the record, it kills me to complain about this mouse, I loved it and now I will have to find something wired that's in its calibre."
2,Finger cramp,"Not sure who was the designer of this trackball, but it causes finger cramps and my discomfort in the button locations lead to more hand aches. Would not recommend this."
3,Logitech Cordless Optical Trtackman(usb/ps/2,"This was designed by a person with BIG hands. If you have small hands you will not be comfortable using it. Wrote to Logitech, no response, I guess one would expect that."
4,Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman,"This is the best trackman yet! I am using 3 of this model. I have never been happy with a standard mouse and have been using a Trackman since the first one was sold. I find it is convienint, accurate and the number of configurable buttons help speed up my work. The only complaint that I have is that the new software limits the button confiruration!! I went back to version 9.6 of the software."
3,Beware Mac-heads,"This trackball device is very well-designed and works well; however, Mac-heads beware. The supplied software does not install correctly (in Tiger), rendering the extra-function buttons useless, and you will get an annoying dialogue box saying that some file is missing every time you re-boot. I sugest that you do not install it at all. It works fine without it, but don't count on using the extra features.I still like it just for the fact that it is cordless and the ball is smooth. Every once in a while (maybe a couple of times a month), you have to remove the sending device from the USB port, as the cursor will freeze."
1,"this is ""cordless""?","I bought this for a laptop to do Photoshop work on when my beloved trackball broke. I thought cordless might be worth it, but this ""cordless"" requires a plug in I/O unit as big as an average mouse. Might work for a tower unit, but having a huge chunk that will hang off a PS slot and a so/so designed trackball as a separate unit i also have to haul around is a non starter. Once I saw that huge chunky plug in unit that allows this thing to be ""cordless"" it went right back into the packaging and was returned. Why would you pay more for cordless when you end up with a corded unit to power your cordless unit?"
5,Great Mouse,"I have been using this about a month and have really gotten spoiled. It fits in a tiny space on my desktop and works very smoothly, quickly and accurately. I use it primarily for audio recording software and am frequently not sitting in front of the monitor so I carry it around the room and it works great from anywhere and at any angle to the computer. I was reluctant to spend that much for a mouse but it has been a great value. Also use it for surfing the web and other apps and it works great there too."
4,Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman,This is a quality product. I used it to replace a Trackman Marble FX. Because it is someshat different in shape it took a while to become comfortable using it.
2,"Track Ball yes, Wireless??","I was looking for a pure wireless track ball. I have had Logitech track balls in the past and they all work great, I wanted wireless. This one comes with a wired receiver that ends up hanging off my lap top even though the mouse itself is wireless. I was hoping for the tiny 1"" or so piece that sticks out from the USB port and the mouse completely wireless."
1,A Pain in the Wrist and Awkward,"A physical therapist recommended the Trackman as a replacement for all mice/trackballs in my department -- whether we complained of problems with RSI or not. After one week of use my wrist ached more than it had in 3 years of working in the same job. Out of 6 employees in my department, only one continues to use it and she admits to not liking it very much.the scroll wheel is so out of place, it doesn't feel comfortable at all to use. The resistance of the primary click is greater than the right click. (this makes no sense.) If you have long fingers like me, you'll have to bend your thumb in to click with the tip of your thumb or else flex your thumb out to use the inside knuckle. no thanks.i shoved this thing back into its box and went back to my Logitech Marbleman - which is balanced, comfortable and allows you to use it with both your left or right hand."
5,Easily the best,"Easily the best finger-operated trackball I have ever used. For right-handers only, but that's not a problem for me. The design and button placement are perfect.The only drawback is that it still uses the old Logitech plug-in receiver. This would be a perfect device if it upgraded to Bluetooth, or even just to Logitech's USB dongle."
5,Good Product,Overall I am very happy with this product. It is the first time I have had a mouse like this and I love it.
5,Yum,"Got it for Christmas, anything you don't like about it you can change, from the buttons and their functions, the sensitivity, how it acts in applications, to the very very useful orientation setting. The USB connector is rather bulky but I really don't care."
2,Not a fan of this trackball,"First, I am a huge fan of trackballs. I am still using a trackball ""Logitech Trackman Marble Mouse"" that I purchased in 2000 after talking it to war in Iraq in the desert. It still works like a champ. I bought this wireless one to use with my Boxee Box as mouse navigation is really slow on the device. The default tracking sensitivity is so low though that the ball was way to unresponsive. I believe you can fix this with windows settings of the software that comes with the mouse but that does not work for Boxee. Beyond that, I am not sure why they changed the ergonomic design so much from the ""Logitech Trackman Marble Mouse"". I found this design to be bulky; the wireless receiver is large and the trackball did not feel comfortable. Also I found the button placement to be awkward. For me I do not think my comfort would be improved with more use, it just felt rather carpal tunnel inducing."
2,Great except for gaming....,"This trackball is excellent, and similar to my old one (MS Trackball Explorer) which has a layout I love.....until you try playing games, I mostly do MMO's, sitting for a min or two in EvE,LOTRO, DDO, few other games will lock it up, hitting the button on the bottom with a paperclip will fix it until you leave the cursor alone again. No problems doing anything else, works fine for general use for days on end.Had to go back and rebuild my old MS Trackball Explorer to use. Set this one aside for when i am repairing machines at home, nice that i do not need a lot of space for a mouse, but disappointing overall."
3,Not that great for 3D Modeling,"Not sure what others might compare this to but personally this mouse is not at all that precise. It may be fine for general computer use, and the extra buttons are great to have, but this mouse is not that fine for 3D software. When it comes to very small movements, it lacks the sensitivity needed to make very minute moves."
2,short life,"I love this device -- easy to set up and it works very well.But they just don't last. I've had three of them. The first one dropped several times onto a hard floor, but kept working for about three years. The next one was never dropped, and worked for about a year. The third was never dropped and just died, after less than a year.Very frustrating -- but I like it so well, I'll probably buy another.Later: I DID BUY ANOTHER -- BUT IT DIDN""T WORK OUT OF THE BOX! What is going on with Logitech?! But I am addicted to the design -- I'm having the defective device replaced."
5,Hands Down... Best Computer Accessory Purchase,"Having the trackball at your fingertips rather than thumb allows easier transition from traditional mouse to this trackball. I use this mouse for CAD and it works great. As any trackball, it does take a bit of getting used to. However, the stress relief on my wrist, as well as saved desk space is completely worth it. An occasional cleaning of the three contact points may be necessary depending on the environment it is being used in. Wonderful purchase. I will never go back to a traditional mouse again."
3,"No more pain, but a terribly dated design.","The device did eliminate some arm pain I was getting from a regular cordless mouse.BUT.The ""wireless"" design of this device doesn't make any sense at all. It doesn't move, so to me, it doesn't need to be wireless, and of course the huge receiver design is more than a decade old. The left click button is way too stiff, and so is the scroll wheel. The wheel also seems misplaced. And those bulge-y buttons just aren't right for interfacing with my thumb. The materials are good, and the construction seems to be good. So overall, it's the dated design that kind of kills this one for me. Still. I think its better than a mouse overall.EDIT:I've since stopped using this trackball. It lost connection very frequently. Putting my phone next to it would cause it to lose its connection. I've gone back to a mouse, but I have to say that I'm still on the lookout for a more modern design, something that just makes more sense overall."
5,I love this mouse!,"I bought this mouse because I was suffering from Carpal Tunnel and I wasn't going to let it stop me from using my computer. Yes this mouse does take some getting used to, I thought I would never get the hang of it but after a year I can't hardly use a conventional mouse anymore. However it's usabiity can't be matched. I have had both my wristed operated on for Carpal Tunnel and my right elbow nerve released (heck of a year....) and I couldn't have stayed sane without being on my computer while homebound for weeks on end. I can easily prop this mouse on a pillow and keep my arm elevated at the same time. I also was able to rearrange the buttons and use this mouse with my left hand. The only reason I am buying another one is because I spilled some water on my current one and it just hasn't been the same since. I hope they never stop making this mouse."
2,Optical Trackman Fan,"I bought this cordless trackman to put in my office,I have two optical trackmans (not cordless) at home,I've been using them for more than 2 years now.The placement of the ball does feel awkward: theball sits in the way of your middle finger. Afterlittle use it started to give me wrist pain. Thetrackman wheel has the ball under the thumb, whichis far more comfortable. I'll let you know if Iget used to this new setup.The drag-lock button is stuck, it does not click.After a little bit of inspection, I found out thatit has been pushed in by the transparent packaging.I'll be returning this one for an exchange. I hopethis is not a common problem."
2,Aw man...,"Man, I was so excited to order this thing to use as our media center input device because a mouse on the recliner arm sucks but the wireless range on this thing use just awful. As soon as the trackball was more than 5 feet from the receiver it would start skipping around everywhere and it was completely useless at 6 ft. I was so impressed with theLogitech VX Nano Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks - Mouse - laser - 5 button(s) - wireless - 2.4 GHz - USB wireless receiverthat I ordered a year ago (it works flawlessly past ten ft) that I thought this would definitely work since the transmitter was 10 times as large but no dice. I'm sure it works really well right next to the receiver but it does not work as a media center/TV mouse replacement."
3,Cordless Trackman is Good,"I purchased this product because I did not have adequate space for a conventional mouse. This trackball has all the additional buttons (programmable) to use for tasks such as back, forward, close app, switch app, etc. The ball is moved by the middle finger (or close to it), not the thumb, which takes some getting used to. Clicking and dragging is probably the hardest thing to do based on button positioning.The alternative is a thumb type wheel. The problem is the thumb type trackballs do not have the additional programmable buttons. To date, no major complaints aside from the 'training' period necessary to learn the movement of the trackball."
5,Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman Vs. Microsoft Trackball Explorer.,"I have to say that Logitech Trackman is diffently better than the Microsoft Trackball Explorer. I always used a mouse til I found the Explorer very eye catching and decided to give it a shot. I feel in love with the ease of use of the explorer. then I decided to start shopping for a new trackball but this time I wanted a cordless trackball that was functional as well as eye catching. The Trackman fit that bill easily. I decided to take the shot. From out of the box I have to say it was worth it. The price is kind of high but it's well worth it. The programing buttons are excellant for you setting them up as you wish. I have purchased 4 others for my laptops, job PC, Touch screen PC and my custom desk top."
3,Would be much better if the wireless receiver were updated,"I've had two of these, and both suffered from wireless reception problems. Cursor tracking is often a bit clunky.The receiver is a plastic housing that sits on your desk and plugs into a USB port via a standard wire. It's kind of like cutting the cable on a wired trackball, installing a transmitter and receiver on the end of each wire, and keeping them six inches apart. Why bother? I'd prefer that it were either wired or given an updated USB receiver that doesn't have a wire leading to a fairly large desk-mounted receiver. Also, the left-click button is pretty firm. I agree that trackball unit is a bit large for smaller hands. If Logitech would scale it down just a bit and update the receiver, it would be a fantastic trackball."
2,Decent enough,"I always preferred trackballs to standard computer mice. In the past I've used Logitech's marble trackman and Microsoft's excellent, and sadly discontinuedMicrosoft Trackball Explorer. Without going into too much detail, Logitech's Optical Trackman is the greatest replacement for the input device I miss the most. I used it for both gaming and CAD work and it excelled in both roles. The left click is a little too close to the two other side buttons and it is a bit small and in games it can cause you to switch items/weapons at inconvenient moments and you get used to it. Unfortunately these input devices aren't built to last. In the period of two years I owned two of these. Within 8 months the left click and become dull and unresponsive and would require extra, wrist tiring, effort to get button cover to trigger the switch. I recommend not getting one unless it comes with a warranty."
2,Initally pleased....,"I was initially very please with this mouse as I love trackball. BUT the large size makes it uncomfortable for prolonged use AND for small hands. I have had it for almost a year now and now the thumb ""clicker"" button is failing. I have been using a similar one at work for over TWO years and the clicker still works great despite linger and more frequent use.... I am disappointed that I will have to replace this already considering the amount of money it cost me... :("
3,Big and Clunky,"Unless you have very large hands, you might find this device hard to use as the device itself is large and the buttons/scroll are too spread out. Other than that, the device works well--no signal drops and saves space compared to a mouse."
2,"Poorly designed, poor support",Drivers do not allow you to remap left and right buttons. Technical support required two pages of forms to submit a simple question. Could be a decent mouse but overpriced and does not allow adequate customization.
2,Not too good.,Found it difficult to use. Poorly designed. Poor button locations. I returned it after a few day trial.
3,Not for me.,"I've had this product for around 6 month. I can not get use to it. I have reverted back to my mouse at work. While the product itself seems well manufactured, I just can't get over the loss of precision. And my RSI was getting worse with the trackman, not better.I am currently running this on my home PC with a Logitech mouse as my primary input. I sometimes use this when I want to sit back and read ebooks. I hold this in my lap and use the scroll features. But that's about it now."
2,Don't waste your money,"This trackball is a big disappointment in many ways, largely because the ball and the left-click button functions work poorly and are very imprecise. Overall the layout of the buttons are not conducive to real comfortable use if you use it heavily/all day. This product is definitely not worth the ~$50 fee for it."
4,"Good buy, some button programming required.","I'm really enjoying this device. It has made many tasks easier. One thing I will note is that the right mouse button is difficult to use where it is positioned. The button layout is flawed in this regard. However, I was able to reprogram one of the other mouse buttons under the thumb to function acceptably in this role."
3,It's okay,"I'm a little Logitech crazy. I really like the stuff that they make. That being said--this is not my favorite device. The left button is a bit awkard--but you can reprogram the buttons as you like. I frankly prefer their wired ambidextrous track ball over this. Will every now and again I crack it out and use it just for the ergonomic benefits of using different devices. Still, somehow the ease of this device in combing a usually speed and accuracy just misses the mark. I will keep experimenting with different setting to try and make it more appealing but haven't really been happy so far."
3,Would be wonderful if it didn't eventually - always - stop connecting,"I have had 3-4 of these. Most comfortable trackball I've ever found. But inevitably at some point it starts disconnecting from the computer and eventually will not connect at all. Logitech tech support is always good and has often helped me get it working again but eventually it stops again. Sometimes it's just low batteries. Sometimes I can get it started by holding down the reconnect button. Sometimes I can get it started by unplugging and replugging it. Sometimes I can get it started by putting the receiver in a different USB port. I WISH THEY MADE A WIRED VERSION!!!!!!! But as they don't, I will have to get myself a less comfortable wired trackball.If it were less temperamental I would give it 6 stars if I could."
1,"Six months later, it decided to stop working.","Purchased the unit in August of 2011. This past month, in January 2012, the left button began to lose sensitivity. It would no longer highlight text, grab and move files, etc. Pushing down hard on the button and moving it around would bring back a measure of competence--for less than a day. After which the problem would repeat.I checked out the Logitech forums, and discovered that this issue is not at all uncommon with this particular trackball. Various users have even listed the many attempted remedies they've applied, without success. All agree that the only sure cure is getting a replacement.Which is what I've asked for, now. We'll see. In the meantime, I can laud this trackball for its performance...when it works. A shape some flaw in its design or manufacture causes a number of them to cease working, after a time. At least it's still under warranty."
3,software issues,Have had an older version of a Logitec track ball for 7 years no issues- this new one started having software issues within two weeks of purchase. Software causes my computer to crash about every 3rd day. Then Logitec trackball no longer works so I'm forced to go back to mouse. This works for maybe several hours and then crashes computer and when it reboots trackball works again..the cycle repeats. have unistalled and reinstalled software for trackball a few times plus tried other solutions but cycle continues...
3,Mixed feelings,"I have always preferred a trackball over a mouse. For one thing, I can't use a mouse when using a laptop while seated in a comfortable chair in the living room. A trackball can sit on the arm of the chair. I used Macally trackballs for several years. Bought a new computer, and wanted a new trackball, but Macally no longer makes them. Finally bought the Logitech.Negatives:It's made in ChinaThe wheel is less convenient than the MacallyWon't work with the same wireless receiver as my Logitech keyboardNo driver for LInux to be able to use all the buttonsPositives:Tracks smoothlyIt's easy to cleanFit's my hand fairly well (but not as well as the Macally)"
5,So good I wore one out and bought another.,"I've been using trackballs for years, my prior trackman was about 5 years old. Finally not sending a good signal. Went to look and it's still being made. Yeah. Bought a new one. Back to happy."
3,first time trackball user,"Someone suggested I try a trackball since I have carpel tunnel. I have a hard time controlling it, even after several weeks of use. But the worst part is I don't really find it any less stressful on my wrist. Maybe I was supposed to get a trackball with the ball on the side instead of the top."
3,Would be a perfect mouse if I had a bigger hand...,"This is my first wireless mouse. I find it to be very responsive with no lag. After just a little use, the marble ball has loosened up nicely and glides well. In that regard, I'm very satisfied with it. Although I've been a trackball mouse user for years, I'm still getting used to the feel of this one. I'm still awkward using the buttons. I think it's probably because the mouse is a little too big for my hand. A few have commented about that."
1,Cordless? NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This supposedly ""wireless"" trackball comes with an antenna on a 3ft cord. So much for wireless. I expected a USB plug-in antenna like a normal wireless mouse uses."
2,Slow Jumpy Response time,"The look and feel of the product is great. But the cursor ""jumps"" all over the screen in directions you're not scrolling to. Move to the left, it might jump all the way to the top first. I think I'll pack this up and send it back. My other Logitech devices are really great, so maybe it's just this one."
1,This ain't the Logitech I used to buy...,"This thing just sucks. Ball did not roll freely, left mouse button was awkward. It's too tall. I am a longtime Marble FX user. Dunno why Logitech can't bring that most excellent device back, but this isn't ANYTHING like it. Save your money."
1,"Not Really ""Wireless""","I have the wired version of this and love it. I bought this wireless version so I didn't have to have a wire tethered to my computer.When I got it, I found I had to plug in a WIRED sending unit. So this results in having another tethered wire thing that dangles from your laptop when you move it. Not very portable and negates having something wireless. Why don't they make this so it can connect via Bluetooth??? It isn't a cheap mouse and no Bluetooth?Logitech: Get a Clue!"
1,"again, no support for left hand","I have tendinitis which prevents me from using a mouse on the right side, even though I'm right handed. I must use a trackball on the left side.This is yet another wireless trackball from Logitech that only works for the right hand.Logitech has no excuse for leaving out left-handed people. It is not so hard to make trackballs that work well for both sides.Apparently the Logitech marketing department must think that left-handed people must love wires, since all their wireless trackballs are for right-handed people only. I wouldn't be posting this negative review if they had a wireless trackball product that worked for me - but they just don't have any."
1,Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman (USB/PS2),Did not use this item so I cannot rate it fairly. The rating given is one because I was requited to give one before being allowed to submit this review and should not be considered negative. I sent it back after deciding to keep the other Optical Mouse.
1,Works great until it doesn't,"I've had this trackball for about six months. Worked great until last week, when it started not working at all. Now I have to push the ""connect"" button every 5 minutes to get it to work. Pretty typical for Logitech trackballs in my experience. I've had two or three of the trackballs with cords and they crapped out after a few months, too. I won't be buying another."
1,worst tracking ever,"I thought this trackball would be awesome, but unfortunately the tracking is the worst I've ever seen. When you spin the ball left and right, the cursor moves up and down. When you spin the ball up and down, the cursor moves left and right. To get the tracking to work, you have to turn the trackball almost horizontal to you, which makes it impossible to use. I'll be returning this immediately."
1,This Trackball Does Not Last!,"I have used trackballs for many, many years & have never really come to appreciate a mouse; still don't. I have used trackballs from Logitech, Microsoft, and a few others I don't remember. I really like the features of this particular trackball (Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman) except in one regard; it expires quickly.The first one I purchased lasted several months and then died. I purchased a second one thinking that the first one was an anomaly; it lasted about a year or so & then recently bit the dust as well.Strangely enough, I still have the first Logitech trackball I ever purchased; it a little grumpy but it still works. Does Logitech continue to make a product that is a loser when it comes to life span. Don't know for sure but this is my experience. Would I recommend it to a friend or enemy. NO!The sad part of this narrative is that I love everything about the trackball except its length of life and seem unable to find another with the same features."
1,Real Disappointment,"I've been using a Microsoft Trackball Explorer 1.0 for several years,and really loved it, but eventually it began cutting off for short periods. I ordered the Logitech Optical Trackman to replace it, but what a disappointment. Somehow this trackball wasn't made for my hand, since when holding it comfortably the only buttons I can reach are the ball and the three left side buttons. And the right click button can not be changed from an awkward left side location, or another button substituted for the right click. The smart move feature is poor compared to my old trackball. I'm using the cordless optical Trackman now, but sure miss the comfort and ease of using my old trackball. I like and respect Logitech, but I think they blew it with this product."
4,LOGITECH CORDLESS OPTICAL TRACKMAN[USB/PS/2],"WHEN FIRST USING THIS TRACKMAN I INSTALLED IT VIA USB. THIS DID NOT ALLOW ALL THE FEATURES IT HAD,IN FACT SENT BACK THE FIRST ONE I RECEIVED. AFTER I RECEIVED THE REPLACEMENT, I EXPERIENCED THE SAME LACK OF ALL FEATURES THIS TRACKMAN WAS TO HAVE. I THEN INSTALLED IT IN THE PS2 PORT AND FOUND THEN THAT ALL FEATURES WERE NOW AVAILABLE. I NOW LIKE IT FINE. ONE WOULD THINK THAT THIS SITUATION WOULD BE ADDRESSED IN THE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS."
5,Works Like Magic,"It's taken me a few weeks to get used to this trackball, but I love it. I have not had any problems with it, like with other wireless mouses. It moves smoothly and feels like I'm using a regular corded device.Love being able to recline in the chair and be able to use it while holding it against my lap."
2,corded usb transmitter/receiver,"trackman is cordless, but usb adaptor has a corded transmitter/receiver. the cord is about 3ft.long & t/r catches on everything when you move laptop around. I had to reel t/r in every time I moved computer from my lap to table. there is no mention of corded usb adaptor in description. cord (wire) has a substandard connection to t/r.when I called logitech customer service & explained my problem to representative I was informed trackman was not for laptop use & was not warranted for laptop use, desktop only. when I tried to argue my case the rep. disconnected me.on second call I asked for supervisor, explained my experience of first call. the problem was promptly resolved & I received a apology. I am awaiting delivery replacement.this is the fourth logitech wireless that I have purchased. the first 3 are flawless. it was a suprise to find a corded usb adaptor, t/r with the 4th. I realy like working with trackball, the rest is questionable."
2,Not ergodynamic,"I'm starting to have pains in my wrist/forearm from using a mouse. Thought this would make wrist and/or forearm feel better. You have to press the enter button with your thumb with enough pressure that by the end of each day, I'm in significant more pain than before. Just switched back to my old trackball...pain gone. Bummer I liked the features but the pain is a dealbreaker."
4,Good device,"modern and comfortable input station.Riliable... I am happy That I got it.the only thing is, it could have been smaller,It is too big for any person hand.but nothing is perfect. I do recommend it anyway."
1,"Has a GIANT cord with GIANT hockey puck at the end. Not a ""unifying"" compatible mouse.","This ""cordless"" mouse has a gigantic cord, one end of which plugs into your USB port, the other end of which is attached to a hockey puck sized receiver. Other Logitech products use what they call a ""unifying"" receiver, which is this tiny little nub that plugs into your USB port and through which you can connect up to 5 different Logitech devices. This ""cordless"" mouse is NOT compatible with the unifying receiver, so if you have another ""unifying"" compatible product you will still need an extra USB port for this mouse. Want to use a trackball style mouse with a unifying receiver? They are rumored to exist, but I can't find hide nor hair of them on Logitech's website. There is NO trackball style mouse with a non-thumb controlled ball that is compatible with the unifying receiver. You are stuck with the giant cord and hockey puck for your ""cordless"" mouse."
3,"Works with a PC running WIndows or Linux, but not well with a Mac","We purchased this trackball for our Mac laptop, but it worked only intermittently. We actually were given a second on by Logitech, but that also did not work reliably with our Mac.I have an old PC on which I run Windows and Ubuntu Linux, and find it works relatively reliably there.We do prefer trackballs to mice or touchpads, since the mice require more space and can become clogged, while the touchpad being in the middle of the keyboard is not always convenient or easy to use."
2,Not for Me,"Add on Software was a real drag, messed up my laptop touch pad. The many buttons can be set for whatever you want, but again the software that came with it and the lastest from the Website...Terrible. Finially gave the Mouse away. NO PROBLEM WITH THE MOUSE ITSELF, JUST THE SOFTWARE."
5,END OF LIFE for the best wireless trackball EVER.,"I have used this trackball for years. I have tried other wireless trackballs and wired trackballs. But the placement and weight and feel of the trackball on this model is simply the best of any existing trackball. I use it daily.Unfortunately, Logitech discontinued this model. It no longer is on the website.It does come with a very long wired USB receiver that is less convenient than the stub receives that other keyboards use.I hope Logitech will come out with a better upgraded model of this trackball - perhaps with a stub USB receiver. Bluetooth would be OK since Apple's portable trackpad also uses Bluetooth.Otherwise, I will have to make do with the several ones I bought - some in storage as replacements should the three current ones I use fail."
2,Disappointing,"As I have a problem with my wrist, arm and shoulder, I was hoping this would solve my mouse problem. However, because of the awkward placement of the various controls, this did not work for me - it caused more problems than it solved. The height and the shape are comfortable, but I would like to see buttons placed to be used by the index finger rather than my thumb. I found myself trying to turn it to a more comfortable position, but that resulted in wrist and arm strain."
4,Happy with my trackman.,"Excellent mouse that saves both wrist and space. Only difficulty I had was reconnecting it. Disconnected, then reconnected and couldn't get mouse to work. Finally reinstalled batteries and it worked fine."
2,What Am I Missing?,"I got this as a gift and after using it three weeks, I've trashed it. You have to be a hand contortionist to use this. The buttons seem off track --in other words, they're not where you think they should be. I found this very uncomfortable in all respects. Furthermore, after I loaded the software, I couldn't go back to my previous LOGITECH WIRELESS MOUSE -- the conventional kind. Logitech graciously sent me a new mouse and keyboard and software disk and I am now back using the conventional mouse. I must be missing something -- I don't know why anybody would use this trackball mouse."
3,"Cordless is good, but this isn't Logitech's best design","I upgraded to this model after finally having to shelve my Logitech TrackMan Marble FX Trackball.I like this model because it is cordless and has a USB connection. I have larger hands, so the size isn't a concern. However, I can understand how users with smaller hands would find this design unworkable.I don't like Optical Trackman as much as the aforementioned Marble FX because:1. It doesn't stay as clean, so the ball jumps and skips;2. It doesn't have the finger-and-thumb control of the old version, so the movement isn't as precise;3. It isn't durable. I've worn out two models in three years. I'm on my third and I won't buy another when this one breaks.I'll be looking for a new trackball soon. Hopefully, Logitech will return to form."
4,Great,I really like this mouse. Although it is a little big for my hand I am getting used to it. I wish they could make a smaller one just like it then it would be perfect.Char
2,cordless trackman,"Having used trackballs for years, I thought I'd love this wireless model. Wrong!! The thumb click button required way too much pressure to click and made my hand uncomfortable after only a few hour's use. I've gone back to using my wired model."
4,great product,"This is my first trackball mouse. I bought it for comfort as with my long fingers they would sometimes cramp and/or fall asleep using a logitech optical mini mouse. I opted for a trackball as you don't have to move your wrist much to operate it while your fingers are relaxed over it.Pros: - COMFORT, my fingers, hand, and wrist don't get tired- FEATURES, dedicated forward and back buttons are awesome as well as a scroll wheel, glide up and down and a drag locking buttonNeutral: As big as it is, I would like it to be a little bigger for my long fingers, but again, my fingers no longer hurt.Cons: - EASE OF USE, the learning curve is a little while with a trackball, I'm still a little faster with a regular mouse.- EXPENSIVE"
4,cordless trackball,Since MS stopped making their trackball this is the closest trackball out there that has the same functionality. I prefer a thumb ball that MS version had but the ergonomics of logitech's makes it easy to convert.
1,MouseWare and drivers don't play well with others.,"I had high hopes for this trackball so I did everything I could to make it work. But, as soon as I installed the MouseWare software, my security software started to inexplicably turn off. I am using Norton Internet Security 2003 on a Windows XP laptop. I called Norton and verified that it was not a virus (or trojan horse, etc.) They said ""It was something that you just installed."" I tried downloading the latest version of the driver. No change. Logitech was responsive (over email) but said, ""Please contact the manufacturer of your program if you have a specific question regarding using our product in that program."" I removed the trackball drivers and MouseWare software and have not had any problems since."
1,Very uncomfortable,"I purchased this as a replacement for my Logitech M570. It was the 2nd M570 I owned and I loved the first one (it eventually broke), but the replacement that I got was always a little difficult to click. I assume they changed the design slightly, or maybe I just got a bad one. My wrist started bothering me so I wanted to try a different trackball. I got this one and hated it. It was very uncomfortable. I ended up returning it and going back to my difficult clicker :("
2,CORDLESS RECEPTION SUCKS,"I HAVE 2 OF THESE AND THE BOTH HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE WIRELESS RECEPTION. ONE IS IN MY BEDROOM, THE RECEIVER IS APS 4' FROM MOUSE. SOMETIMES IT WORKS AND SOMETIMES IT DOSENT. IV TRIED HANGING IT, PLACING ON MY BED ( WITCH DEFEATS THE PORPOISE OF WILRLESS) ON THE DRESSER. NO WHERE DOES THE SEEM TO GET PROPER RECEPTION. THE OTHER ON IS ON MY WIFES LAPTOP. I ATTACHED THE RECEIVER TO THE LID AND STILL THE MOUSE HAS TO BE IN JUST THE RITE PLACE TO WORK. ALSO THE POINTER IS TO SLOW, IF I PLAY A GAME THAT I NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY THE POINTER DOES NOT RESPOND AS FAST AS IM TRYING TO MOVE. LIKE PLAYING POOL, IT WONT HIT THE BALL AS HARD AS IM TRYING TOO. WHEN IT DOES WORK I LOVE IT BUT IM TIERED OF REPLACING BATTERIES AND MOVING THE RECEIVER. WENT BACK TO MY WIRED MOUSE IV HAD FOR EVER"
2,Not the Mouse I ordered,Sent me a black trackball. It is NOT the same one that is in the picture. The silver and Black mouse has more buttons and operates differently than the all black one that you sent me.Poo poo. I need a mouse so I am stuck. Very dissapointed.
1,Not as hoped,"I bought this after finding it impossible to replace my old Microsoft Explorer trackball. The scroll wheel is in a very awkward spot and I couldn't envision myself being able to use this as smoothly as my Explorer (which still works). I already submitted a request for a refund and will be putting it in the mail tomorrow. On the bright side, Amazon does make it pretty easy to return."
2,"Very frustrating to use, erratic behavior","I really wanted to like this device, but it makes it very hard to do so. It is well designed, I like the size of the ball, but the button placement leaves a lot to be desired, especially the main button (""left""). There are two things Logitech must improve. First, this thing is a battery drain, which is expensive and environmentally unsound. Second, it's interface to the computer (Mac OS X) is strange. Many times the behavior is as if the left button is continuously pressed, it would attempt to drag objects I have no interest in dragging and so on. This device will end in the trash and I will buy a new trackball from another manufacturer. Other, less important irritants are erratic pointer movement and the fact that it does not work well in direct sunlight."
3,Trackman review,This track ball mouse didn't perform as well as I expected. It doesn't respond as well as I hoped when I use it.
2,Poor performance,Logitech has been declining for a couple years in quality. This piece of junk works 60% of the time and is NOT ergonomically safe. As I type this the wheel barely moves the mouse and the buttons work intermittently.
4,great buy if you like wireless,"Love trackball which is why i bought this. can't find in stores anymore. BUT it interferes with the wireless headset for my phone, so have to go back to wired."
3,"Good for ergonomics, not detailed movement","I was hoping this mouse would help me with my photoshop selecting with the flexible movement of the mouse, but I was disappointed. The accuracy is not great, but it works very well for normal mouse movement and a comfortable experience where the user does not like the wrist movement involved with a normal mouse or who has limited mouse space."
5,Wireless Trackball,This is a wonderful product. I have been using a trackball for years but always had to contend with the wire even though my keyboard was wireless. The wireless trackball was easy to install and works like a charm. I can even hold the trackball in my lap and it responds on the screen. May purchase a second device for another computer.
3,Quality is good,"I have been using trackball type mice for as long as I can remember. This one is ok, it's kinda weird using your finger to roll the ball, but you can get used to it. I do like all the extra buttons they give you. I just wish they would add those buttons to a thumb controlled trackball mouse."
1,"ergomonically speaking, very awkward","was having finger numbness when using my old mouse. thought a trackball would do the trick. the design of this trackball, unfortunately, is very awkward. The ""left-click"" button is on the left side of the mouse, such that the act of pressing it causes your hand to move to the right (due to the lack of opposing force). I tried it for a few weeks and could not get the hang of it. In fact, my wrist started to hurt in a different place than before. I got rid of it. If you are considering this design, you should try it out in a store before purchase."
1,"Nice design, really low DPI","This mouse has all the buttons and wheels exactly where I want them. The receiver works perfectly, but the ball is horrible.Out of the box it is off by about 45 degrees, and you have to install the (Windows-only) software to correct it. But nothing can correct the DPI. It's like using one of those really really old bad mice when the rollers got dirty: it jumps from one place to another without ever passing the pixels in between. Maybe I got a lemon?The software replaces the normal mouse settings in the control panel, so if you switch to another mouse you cannot adjust the settings on it. So basically, if you use this track ball, you can never go back. Warning: Make a system restore point before installing the software!"
1,"Cordless, except for the long cord attached to the huge receiver","If you look at the latest generation of cordless mice, particularly those from Logitech, they have *very* small receivers. TheLogitech VX Nano Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks, for example, has a receiver that sticks out of the USB port only about 1/4"". Logitech's website even has an image showing the evolution of cordless receivers, and the Cordless Optical Trackman has a receiver Logitech dates around 2002. I wanted to use the Trackman with my laptop (from my recliner - you get the picture ;-) but the *huge* outdated receiver and long receiver cord means that using it on a laptop has no benefit. This thing's going back."
2,not reliable,"I ordered this trackball to use with my laptop. I did not want to have all those wires etc when off site. I did not realize there is a base unit that needs to be connected, hence still wires etc. So I use on my home computer now. But it has stopped working for no reason, intermittently. I will put it aside and go back to my old mouse. Then, when I try it again, it will work, but for how long?Since I have had it less than a year (and probably was 6 months when I first had trouble) I thought to return it, but cannot find where to do this or how on Amazon...convenient?"
1,Optical Mouse,I've always liked the trackman mouse. This time I tried the cordless version and I have to be honest. I don't care for it at all. What good is a cordless mouse when you can't get more than six inches away and this is with new batteries. As the batteries start to weaken I have to move the receiver even closer. I could have would have saved myself money and purchased one with a cord had I known how poor the performance was going to be.
2,Not a good design,"I have used a trackball for 2 decades, and when my Microsoft trackball died I tried to replace it, only to find that it was no longer available, and old stock models were going for $300 or more. So I tried this thing.Ergonomic placement of auxiliary buttons is not good, and the hand contorts just enough to be annoying.But the worst problem is cursor stability at the moment of the click. If you are doing precision work, don't even think about buying this trackball, because it's hard to perfectly locate the cursor. And to make clicks work properly, one must remove one's thumb from the ball before clicking or the cursor will be pulled off target.Unacceptable."
3,Older is better,"I bought this for a new computer. I wanted a trackball because of limited space. Unfortunately, there are few cordless ones on the market. This one had nice features and in general worked well. However, the button that controls mouse clicks is mounted so that there is sideways pressure when it is pushed. This means the trackball must be held securely or it will move sideways. My old trackball had a button that was pushed down, and it never moved.As a result I reinstalled the old cordless trackball on the new computer and relegated this one to the seldom used back-up computer. I'm sorry I wasted the money."
3,Just average,"Reliable functioning, but overall size and button placement are somewhat awkward. Ball isn't as smooth as it should be."
1,Premature Failure --> Unreliable Tracking,"During the last year I have had 3 to these trackballs. All three of them prematurely failed in operation. The first lasted almost 6 months, but the second lasted all of 2 weeks and the third 32 days before they failed to move the cursor. They first got to the point they would only move the Cursor when in an upside down or on their side position, then they failed completely. Great Ergo dynamics but that is only good if they are reliable."
1,dont buy this,"i would not recommend this thing to anyone,it stops responding very often..it seriously gets on my nerves how often it stops.....unfortunately i threw out the packaging so i cant return it.."
3,"Lots of potential, less performance","I did not keep it long. The ergonomics are great but the button and ball locations were the deal breakers for me. Too many years of using fingers for clicks, the use of the thumb near base of the device to left click just did not seem natural. If this device had the ball on thumb side and traditional finger locations for primary buttons it would be the ticket. Sadly, though, it does not. I will wait, but do so with another device."
2,Soft Plastic Peals Off Black Surface,"Love the mouse and have not had it but a little over a year and the plastic has come off the black, making it look quite old. Would not buy another one, for my last one shorted out on the wireless receiver. Thats two tries and two strikes out. I think I have given it enough of my time and money."
4,So Far So Good,"I've owned track balls before, starting w/Microsoft Trackball. I don't use it for gaming. I have arthritis in my hands and wanted a straight-forward mouse that was comfortable and I could program. I worried about its being wireless, wondered how it would work. The wireless feature works well. I have the sensor resting on my tower and the mouse is on an articulated keyboard about 3 feet away. I have not had any problems with it since I bought it 3 months ago. I especially like how it feels and fits. I am a woman with medium-sized hands and this mouse is not too large. It's not a custom fit, but for a generic mouse it's great. I am very satisfied with this product."
5,Love it,"I had a previous version of the Trackman for my PC years ago where the ball was side mounted for control with the finger tips. This is the updated version. Although slightly different, it is a great device. I find the dexterity of fingertip control much much better than thumb control track balls and much easier and intuitive to use. It is far more comfortable than a mouse (especially the one that comes with a Mac) and for general control as well as specialized application I use in Photography, it is a real time and fatigue saver. I don't know what the complaints are about I see here and there with this device. The ball runs smoothly, button are right where they need to be, fully programmable with my Mac....works great. Highly recommend. Any suggestions for logitech would be the one I do see brought up from time to time....Bluetooth would be great but no big deal."
5,take it or leave it,"i love this thing but i have had a lot of users beg to differ. i am a win sysadmin (hey i do my *nix with style) and the need for a good mouse is essential. I love that it is wireless and can move it about. it is unbelievably durable, trust me i have dropped it several times on hard services. the only issue that muck gets trapped in the optical lenses and needs to be cleaned out regularly. all and all it is a great grab..."
4,comfy!,"Just received the Logitech Trackman yesterday. This may not be the ultimate ergonomic mouse, but it comes pretty darn close. My SO has the Microsoft Trackball Explorer. Both are very similar in terms of comfort, performance, and ease of use. I would say the Logitech trackball has a slight edge in terms of comfort (I find the contour fits my hand more naturally), while the Microsoft trackball has better button layout. Again, the differences are incremental at best. If cost is your main concern, go with Microsoft (about $10 less). If you prefer comfort and supporting the little guy, go with Logitech.A final note: my trackball would not work initially after installation, until my cat (no mouse jokes, please) knocked it to the floor. Then, all of a sudden, it started working. Guess she must have jiggled some connection in place. It does make me wonder whether the fix will last."
1,Lasts for two years. That's it,"Bought 4 of these back in 2010. At this time in 2012 only one keeps working. The same defect in all 3 of these trackballs - the 'left' button, i.e. the main button, which you click with your thumb, does not function any more. All 3 broke within the last couple of months. I suspect the 4th will not last much longer. If you want your mouse (trackball) work more than 2 years, look for something else...A couple of weeks after I wrote the original review, the last Trackman has broke the same way, as expected"
3,Its not a MS Trackball Explorer,"If I could still find a new trackball explorer for the price (or even double the price) of this product I would have bought that.Pros:The control layout is comfortable for those familiar with the TBEBall rolls easily and smoothlyAll button assignments automatically recognized by Ubuntu LinuxCons:Wish the scroll wheel was controlled by my thumb and the fwd/back buttons on the top of the unitThe wireless setup is last generation, wish it operated on the small unified wireless system of the newer products which would improve portabilityThe primary button should be larger and contoured with the thumb rest areaUgh...batteries, wish it could charge off USBNotes:I bought this knowing that it would probably wobble, and it does. Have to stick something on the bottom to even out the four contact points, which is easy to fix. Easy enough though, that I shouldn't have to do it."
4,not perfect but good... try Armorall on ball,"It's amazing that trackballs are not more popular, and that there are relatively few choices. I like LOTS of buttons, and this one has a bunch... but the ones on top don't seem to be easily available to the index finger OR the thumb!? What were they thinking? I use a Trackman Marble for my left hand (no scroll wheel!?) and now the Optical Trackman for my right (in addition to the Wacom tablet... I like lots of input options! Diversity for my hands!) One trick I learned is that a LITTLE bit of Armorall on the track BALL will help it to roll SO smoothly! It's night and day... (they should ship it with a small tube!)"
1,Awkward,"I was hoping to switch around the stressors on my arm having dealt with tendoitis at one point in my wrist, and later in my elbow due to 'mousing' too much, so thought after the thumb operated trackball this would be a good way to switch it up from the standard mouse, but it is awkward to use. I can't get used to left clicking with my thumb. I wish I had kept the box, I would return it."
1,If I had hands like a Gorilla...Maybe,The configuration of this thing is designed in such a way that you can almost feel the decourveins tendon stretching to new heights of pain. IT'S HUGE!! If you don't have hands that can hold five baseballs and a extra two thumbs don't bother.
2,It should work for this kind of money!,"Wow, I have a logitech optical mouse and it works flawlessly. I bought this and quickly noticed that the scroll wheel doesn't always work. Sometimes if you scroll down, even at VERY close range, nothing happens. Then if you scroll back up it'll go down, or if you scroll down again it'll go down twice as far.I sent it back and Amazon's great service sent me a new one. It has the same problem. I count eight buttons on this thing, the software is good, but not great. One unreliable feature ruins it for me though. I'd keep it but the scroll wheel just keeps making me mad; work darnit! No scrollwheel would be better than one that works sometimes or in the opposite direction that you're trying to scroll."
5,AWSOME!,I want every winter wonderland bratz girl doll there is!they are so pretty i give it a five in education because it teaches u how to take care of urself and be pretty
3,Hair care,I am giving this a 3 star cause it's way too expensive for a hair conditioner.I think it works fine BUT the thing is that I have had other conditioners that work just as well or better and I pay less than half the price for them. I dunno if I can mention other brands here but if you're looking for something that costs much less and works just as good I recommend aphogee products.If you don't mind spending the cash then this product is good for you since it makes your hair feel soft and more manageable when you're done.I don't have a problem with this product. I took the risk and paid for it wondering if it'll do more than my regular products.
5,Fabulous Hair,"Hi - I am a hair person, and a woman 50+ with thick textured color-treated hair chin length. I have used every product on the market, and am very pleased with Kerastase which is recommended by all of the high end hair designers and salons that I've worked with over the years. I use Kerastase Bain Chroma Riche shampoo, and alternate the Kerastase Reflection Chroma Reflect and Chroma Riche hair masques (I use the masque once a week and alternate between the two weekly). This gives me repair (riche) and shine (reflection). These are amazing products that make your color treated hair soft, shiny, silky and healthy."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This thing is nothing more than a for the moment hair conditioner. Just like any other hair conditioner that you rinse out. It does what other conditioners do,..makes your hair very soft and it leaves it feeling healthy. For that day. It doesn nothing to repair damaged hair. My hair was the same condition the next day after my shampoo. I did not expect it to be repaired perfectly,..but it was like I never used this product. If Im spending this kind of money on a conditioner,.I expect results."
2,Very Expensive and not as fantastic as I hoped,I did a lot of research before deciding to buy this product and read a lot of reviews by other people.The reviews seemed very 50/50. Either the conditioner worked great for some or worked only as well as any regular conditioner for others. It was my experience that this conditioner had no wonderful results that were above and beyond regular conditioner. It works well as a daily conditioner for my hair but it way to expensive to be used daily.
1,The Kindle/iPad version of this book is a joke!,"The musical examples are simply impossible to read... I don't know if I've been unlucky, but on numerous pages I cannot even see the lines of the musical system!"
3,Almost gave it one star....,"I very nearly gave up on this book about 100 pages into it. This is the first book I've read with Voort as the main character and he's pretty bland. The only thing that saved it for me was Nye. He was even boring at first, but as his backstory came out, the novel really picked up speed and I couldn't put it down. I don't know if I like Voort enough to read the other novels about him, though."
5,Great camcorder -- just watch out for slow start-up times,"This is my first DVD camcorder and I absolutely love it! It's also my first 3-chip video camcorder. The image quality is just really good, like the other guys said. The machine is also apiece of cake to use. I e-mailed ""gadgester"" and he recommended TDK 8.cm dvd-r blanks from amazon, so I bought them and now I just pop one in and go! No formatting needed. Finalization in the camcorder is needed to make the dvd-r compatable with my Sony dvd player at home as well as my Thinkpad.One gotcha to look out for is the slow start-up times, from power off to on. It takes anywhere between 5 and 10 seconds for the camcorder to be ready to record, after you insert yoru dvd-r. If you use dvd-rw, the manual says it might take up to 20 seconds! Other than that, I have no problems with the camcorder. It's high quality, and I just love the conveneince as well as image quality."
5,Better than the Sony 405,"The picture quality is exceptional and it is very easy to use. So much nicer than punching the screen for menus like the Sony 405. Who wants to worry about finger prints and scratches all over the screen with those touch screens? It is also priced better than the Sony 405. We researched these cameras a lot before settling on the Panasonic, with picture quality being our #1 objective. We are more than pleased with our purchase!!"
4,Software Learning Curve,"If one takes a fairly good video that needs no editing, a TV presentation is very simple but limited to about 18 minutes, which is the capacity of one side of the mini DVD-RAM disc (which I prefer to use!).Computer download, editing and ultimate burning to a normal-sized DVD is done with the bundled, two-part Pacman-style software whose manual is large but not very explicit or user friendly.I recommend that one use only re-writable DVDs for the in-camera media as for burning presentation discs unless one is in need of shiny coasters...I teamed up with another user and we help each other with computer-related problems. The quality of the camcorder's video output itself is excellent.This is a five-star device with three-star software."
1,difficult to transfer,"Very difficult to transfer video's to my computer, I've since purchased a much friendlier video camera. Do no recommend to anyone"
2,Expiration,I was dissapointed that this product had less than a year to expire. For such a large quantity and price I will have many left over.
1,1/3 Door Beads,Thought door beads would cover entire doorway for what I paid. Instead it only covered 1/3 of door. Daughter was upset.
4,Nice Cargo Net!,"Just received the cargo net today. Very prompt shipping. However, they did ship me the camo version of the net instead of the one pictured above. Fits my small S-10 truck bed perfect after tightening it up a little. Very good quality cargo net. Hooks seem durable. Only downside to this net would be the larger holes in the netting. I have a very small truck bed so it doesn't create a problem for me, but I could see it possibly becoming a problem with a very large truck bed carrying a lot of small items."
3,Wrong net for me,I didn't unpackage the net as I could see that the netting wasnot small enough for my use. so am not really able to makemuch of a comment. The net was returned...
5,Ray Lives on,This soundtrack reminds us where the true soul and R&B music came from. If you don't here this soundtrack you have truly missed a treat.
3,Songs are good but...,"These are great songs and it matches up well with the movie, however the sound quality is less than stellar. Sounded so much better in the actual movie. I can't understand why the CD producers didn't enhance the sound quality to be the same as the movie itself."
1,Ray! Original Motion Picture Soundtrack - NOT,This is NOT the soundtrack from the motion pictue. This is some tracks that were recorded from his live concerts and some other recordings. The music from the motion picture is NOT on this cd. Very disappointed as I was looking for the music I heard when I watched the movie. a lot of these songs aren't even in the movie.
2,disappointed,"i was very disappointed because i bought the cd for the last track ""georgia on my mind"" which was sung with such passion and improvisation during the credits of the movie. i should have just reordered the dvd from netflix and played the end over and over."
5,A must for discerning music fans,"After seeing the truly inspirational movie and witnessing an incredibly awe-inspiring performance by Jamie Foxx, I felt compelled to purchase the soundtrack. After seeing the movie, each song, with its own unique story behind it that left an indelible impression from the movie, comes alive with the unmistakable passion and vigor that only Ray Charles can evoke. Songs like Marianne, Unchain My Heart, & What'd I Say(live) make the CD worth owning by themselves."
5,Incredible,"This has to be one of my favorite albums ever, and I'm not even a jazz or R and B fan. I listen to Punk Rock and Ska, but this album is right up there, in my opinion some of the best music ever made. I think that this tribute to Ray brings back the sound of his music remarkabley well. Everything is perfect, every track is one of my favorite Ray Charles songs. Among Ray charles, this album is a great way to start, and you should definately try to get it if you are a Ray Charles fan."
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE -Ray","The music from the ""movie"" was great and so buying the Soundtrack with all of the ""best"" makes sense. Totally recommend this one, whether you've seen the movie or not."
4,Something extrange,"I bought this CD, it has not arrived yet.Aparently it costed 12.97 but I am payng for two of this cds.Has anything like this happened to you?There are two cds with all the songs?Or did I make a mistake?Thanks for the answers."
4,Very Good,"If you liked the movie ""Ray"" then you will love the CD. All the songs are on the CD. it is a very heart felt and upbeat yet relaxing CD. I love country music but this is a different insight into the music world. Ray was a great muscian and Jamie Fox did a great job portraying him."
1,amateurish bit of horror claptrap,"This is a senseless, gory film about a serial killer who escapes from prison and continues to slash and kill on his way to find his former girlfriend who turned him into the FBI. She is supposed to be in some sort of witness protection program (witless protection) and joins an AA group to get sober. In the program she meets a charmingly supportive fellow AA member who is an inept sexual partner (premature ejaculation). This serial killer has thousands of ""fans"" and copycat killers (sickos). The story line is predictable and the camera work nauseating. The camera work reminds me of my parents attempts to catch family events on their old 8mm camera and heads are cut off and things go in and out of focus. This is not my idea of entertainment or good film-making. It is an amateurish bit of horror claptrap. If you get the sense that I didn't like this film, you are on the money."
1,A horrible way to die is a horrible way to make a movie.,"The writer, Simon Barrett, wrote a commendable and very interesting story which the director/editor, Adam Windgard, completely butchered with the help of the photgraphers, Chris Hilleke and Mark Shalhorse.The cut from one scene to the next over used black screens of varing lengths which made you feel like they were cutting to a commercial. The POV for many of the takes were ill chosen and lacked the kind of professional continuity expected for a filmm transferred to Blu-Ray.The photographers probably never heard of a Steady-Cam as the screen bobbed continueslly up and down and from side to side. If they think this was a hip technique it was tried years ago and was amateurish then.The acting was for the most part was excellent especially Amy Seimetz and A.J. Bowen both of which were convincing.In summary, I would advise you to save your money as there are many fine examples of this genre out there."
2,CAMERAMAN LOVES LIGHTS AND BLUR,A Horrible Way To Die isn't a terrible movie but easily puts you to sleep with the exceeding amount of film blur and use of spotlights throughout the film. You cannot see images and if this was intended when filmed then I would suggest moving on because this is so distracting it is overly annoying and actually makes one dizzy watching it. It is like the guy shooting the film cannot hold the camera steady.
2,Not as good as The Matrix.,"Yo I'mma keep this short and to the point. This movie was in no way better than The Matrix. Regardless of if anyone's said that it was or not, this movie fails to deliver in a lot of ways. First off, they don't tell you what the horrible way to die is. You have to use your imagination and make up your own mind to figure out what it is. I hate it when directors leave something open for interpretation, and this is another one of those cases. It's like how The Shawshank Redepmtion is a rip off of Escape from Alcatraz but just with more drama thrown in.The graphics in this movie were ok, so i'll give it an extra star. They were almost as good as God of War 3's."
3,good story marred by bad camera work,"This is an unusual story of a serial killer who comes back for his former girlfriend, but not for the reasons you would think. There are some great locations and mood music, as well as a creepy atmosphere. Unfortunately, the director chooses too much movement of the camera, shaking and blurring, which distracts one from the story.Without that, it would have been stronger."
3,"Interesting premise, horrible execution","I will have to chime in with the rest of the Vine reviewers on this one and state the obvious even further: along with an interesting story ruined with a horrible way to make a film (handheld tremors to the maximum) - they made it even worse by filming the documentary the same way!The premise has a dark and film worthy stance on a serial killer having some form of redemption by the end, but the director made some very poor decisions and alienated a large group of potential followers with his poor creative process.There could have been a chance to really describe his intentions in the making-of, but instead I was even more irritated with how he chose to have his behind the scenes maker shoot it in similar fashion. A few stars for the story, none further for the extras or film quality."
2,Horrible,Just Horrible!!!! I spent $8.00 on this and i will not go as low as to sell it.More about hanging in bars aa mettings Dull killing Horrible plot just plain Horrible!Very slow movie get to the killing please.
2,A very mediocre Anchor Bay horror film.,"Anchor Bay really used to be a great company for classic horror titles reissued on DVD, they also used to have great exclusive extras on many of the titles.Now they are in the movie making business, and now the they hardly even do reissues at all, a sad reality.The film I just watched ""A Horrible Way To Die"" was just mediocre IMO, the story, the directing and the acting.Anchor Bay seems to crank out these generic horror titles these days, sadly the old Anchor Bay is no more, and many of the great horror reissues are now OOP, and command high prices.At least AB still has Halloween (1978), Dawn Of The Dead (1978), Evil Dead (1982), and Day Of The Dead (1985) in their catalogue."
3,A Horrible Way To Die,"A Horrible Way to DieI was disappointed in this movie. It is slow moving and pretty boring until the last 10 minutes. I don't know how it stunned festival audiences unless they were stunned into boredom. I have to admit the ending was interesting.The serial killer Garrick Turrell was the most polite serial killer I have ever seen in a movie.I thought the acting was well done. I didn't know if some of the weird scene shots (shaky movement and out of focus shots),were to enhance the movie but all it did was annoy me. There isn't even much dialogue throughout the movie. The scenes are before and after Garrick's arrest and from Garrick and his ex girlfriend Sarah's point of view. The only best part of the movie is the last ten minutes or so. At this point it moves pretty fast and it is a surprise ending. I wouldn't pay to buy this movie and I would only rent it if there isn't anything else. If you want to see horrible, cool ways to die try renting Chain Letter."
2,A good sleeping pill,"Wow. This is one slow movie. Flashbacks, flash forwards, horrible photography, low-key soundtrack, and mostly off-screen violence make for one dull serial killer flick. Actors are actually pretty good, but they are so soft-spoken and almost dazed half the time. This is a very slow ride and will require a lot of patience if you want to make it to the end, which is ridiculous and fairly predictable. Nothing scary here, folks. I would have welcomed an occasional scream, chase or exagerated musical note to wake me from my coma."
2,On What?,"So many of the poems and ""supposed"" doctor stories do not relate to doctoring at all. I found 30% of the book to be worth reading. Its a good book to pick up and read a few poems from but its certainly not a cover to cover read. If you are looking for a book to help you get more insight into being a doctor or a doctor's life this book is not for you. I would not recommend this book to anyone, but its really cheap and there are a few good poems in it so if that is what you are looking for this is the book for you!"
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"I recently heard about ""ionic technology"" as it relates to hair dryers and how it cuts down on drying time dramatically, while producing shinier, smoother locks. I was definitely interested and was surprised to see the number of different models available. I selected the Gold N Hot Professional Turbo Boost Ionic Hair Dryer.I dried my hair as usual and it did not dry any faster with this dryer than with a conventional dryer. My hair was not smoother or softer. Still wanting to believe the hype, I tried it on my two daughters' hair. Faster drying time? Nope. Smoother, shinier hair? Ha ha ha.I gave this product two stars because it IS a nice hair dryer. It is completely covered in some sort of rubber/foam material, which means the end never gets hot to the touch. It is relatively quiet and not too heavy. BUT... that's not why I bought it. I wanted the benefits of ionic technology, which it did not deliver."
1,Not worth the money,I bought this blowdryer and I hadnt used it because I had been going to the hairdresser's to get my hair done. The one day I decide to wash and blow dry my hair-this blow dryers attachments came apart. It is very awkward to use unless you have someone doing your hair. I started blowdrying my hair and pieces of the attachment came apart leaving me to go and purchase another hair dryer.
2,Yawn,"I'm sorry to say that this book almost put me to sleep. I'm not quite sure what the problem was, but something was definitely off. The novel is set in London 1811 with the heroine, Emmaline, trying to support herself and an aging aunt by means of a marriage broker service. Unfourtenely her first paying customer dies near her doorstep under suspicious circumstances. Enter Adrian, the duke of Trent who has been reluctantly recruited to determine if the lovely Emmy had something to do with the death. A love-hate relationship quickly develops between Emmaline and Adrian, and the supporting characters (Emmaline's ex-actress aunt and Adrian's man-of-affairs) do everything they can to throw the couple together.Individually I found all the characters likable (especially the canary) and the plot interesting, but as a whole the book was uninspiring. There was no nail-biting tension, no steamy passion, and no real reason to turn the pages. I sorry to say this was a yawner."
3,Almost...but not quite,"The book's plot had a lot of potential. The main male, Adrian, however, never really developed in the book. He was a very flat, two-dimensional character. Despite the ""tension"" between the two main characters, there wasn't a true spark and it left me feeling uninspired."
3,Good but dense,"This book represents a significant and thought provoking review of the history and social context of Candomble. I recommend it highly to any one who is already rather versed in the subject. It is not, however, written in language that is widely accessible to the average reader. Any college professors out there should think twice or thrice before assigning it to undergraduates, unless you wish to assign a dictionary as well! It is too densely written for the average person, something I consider a real crime in a book that is otherwise very good."
3,"Secrets, Gossip, and Gods Review","Although this book did include some worthy information on the Candomble subject, it entirety contained numerous lengthy definitions of what exactly a secret is, rather explore the subject any deeper. I personally was very disappointed with this author, gilding his lack of information contained in this book with an extensive vocabulary."
5,Field Collecting Gemstones and Minerals,"This is an earlier edition of Field Collecting Gemstones and Minerals. Both are excellent, so if this one is hard to find, it may be simpler to get Field Collecting Gemstones and Minerals (see its review)."
4,Great for traveling!,"I took this hair straightener to Israel with me and it worked great! I have long, thick hair and it did a good job. I gave it 4 stars because it could have gotten a little hotter but my hair is very coarse. Just use the right plug adapter and you can take this anywhere in the world without using a converter. If I wasn't using this for travel I would look for something less expensive."
2,don't bother,"I am an avid LP fan and have used their books in several other countries, but found this one to be incredibly unhelpful. We ended up stranded on a military base, sleeping in our car for a night, and the guidebook had the wrong number for the hotel we were trying to reach. Furthermore, the book seems to breeze over some of the nicer off-the-beaten-path spots, like Mazunte and Zipolite."

1,A sad case of poor scholarship,"Mr. Paul Rout has proffered a highly jounalistic and prosaic account of the life and teaching of Bonaventure and his spiritual father Francis. The book is poorly constructed and offers very little grounded information. Rout is a memenber of the Franciscans yet fails to comprehend the basic tenets and teaching of the men who shaped the order to which he belongs. Perhaps he should have joined then Jesuits who, as anyone will tell you, understand the principles of scholarship and spirituality needed to tackle the profound insights of these two thinkers. From the shoddy presentation, however, it is clear that Rout could not even finish the elementary stages of a Jesuit formation."
1,Could use more research,The author of this slim volume did not do his homework. He does not seem to grasp the differeing natures of these two saints. Perhaps the author is a relative of the publisher because that is the only way he could get in print!
1,Cheap pulp non-fiction.,How the publishing world here in Great Britian can allow such hodge-podge to be distributed is beyond the reckoning of the educated mind. Mr. Rout is irresponsible in his treatment of both of these religious figures and offers a mere journalistic account of their ideas and beliefs. Perhaps Mr. Rout should undertake some elementory class in basic writting skills and in the methods of academic scholarship. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS NON-SENSE!
1,Two Thumbs Down...,This book really was a dull read because it was poorly researched and wriiten. Rout's attempt at explaining the process of Franciscan mysticism in two pages is laughable and any discerning mind can see that he lacks any intellectual or spiritual depth. This is another example of the slim volumes biographies of philosophers which emerged in the 1990's as ameans to appeal to the general population.
1,Very Disappointing Book,Although the author is a noted theologian this work really did not satisfy the criteria for a complete study of the subject. The biographies were shallow and the examination of mystical experience laughable. It reads like a Sunday school book of 'inspiration' for 13 year olds with 'religious feelings'.
1,Saint Francis,"Father Paul Rout's small study of these two seminal figures in Chrisitanity leaves the reader feeling that more is needed. It is a short and fragmented study which may have amounted to something if more time and effort were put into the scholarship.It seems to be an outline for what could be a great study. However, the current work amounts to rehashed lecture notes."
1,Poor Research,"Paul Rout's attempt at capturing the essence of Francis and Bonaventure fails in several key area. The tone of the book is pedantic and misses out at capturing the totality of the mystical process which the two saints in questions went through.It also is somewhat muddled in its expository section. It is obviously a 'feel good' book intended to proffer the deep mystical insights of thinkers to the New Age crowd.If it were more thought out it might have had some redeeming qualities, hiowever, it misses the mark. Poor reasearch plain and simple."
1,Complete non-sense.,In this book Rout - a self proclaimed Gay priest - tries to suggest that both Francis and Bonaventure were gay. How could he much such accusations? Perhaps is is merely projecting his own lifestyle. I have nothing against gay people but Rout's insightsa are unfounded.
5,Work well,What can I say.....batteries and they work. Shipping was in good time. I would buy these again. I use them for blinkers for running at night
5,Superb,"I had listened to the album so many times, some 30 years ago, imagine my delight when it came out on CD! This CD celebrates rumba and more, played by some of the greatest rumberos you will ever hear. You will have to search far and wide to find music played with more skill, heart, and soul."
3,Off Da Hook Hip Hop Instructional Video Review,My 8 and 9yr old daughters like it. The 8 year old dances with it on a daily basis.
5,A Great Read! Don't miss this one.,"I found Secrets That You Keep to be a fast-paced engaging book with very beliveable, well-developed characters.Rachel Martin is a heroine for the thirty-something woman. The author's knowledge of Mexico and missonary life must be from first hand experience. Great job. I only hope there is a sequel in the works!"
1,Get Smart Season 1 and 2,"This product was clearly a bootleg copy. I called customer service and told them how upset I was to get a bootleg copy so they shipped another, and guess what...exact same thing...bootleg! I bought this from Amazon direct, not from a reseller. I emailed Amazon to report it and requested someone call me...no one has done so. I guess I'll call HBO next since it's their licensed product that is being bootlegged and resold and Amazon doesn't seem upset about this."
5,Bought for my teenage son.,"He really likes the physical comedy, gadgets, and old type of comedy ( the bumbling Smart who always get his man or saves the day)."
2,Repetitive and Boring!,"I was excited to find this set of Season 1 & 2 at such a great price. I don't subscribe to cable TV anymore, I watch my DVD's instead. I have many good memories of watching this series but I have a limited budget so I purchased this set. I was very disappointed with the shows. Perhaps it's b/c they are the early shows, I don't know. I agree w/other reviews that say once you've seen one or 2 episodes they all seem the same. Smart's performance seems very mechanical. Perhaps later seasons get more interesting but I didn't keep these, I got rid of them."
5,Smart From the Start,"If yyou love ""Get Smart""yyou simply have to gwt this se3t!Beginning with ""Mister Big-the only episode shot in black and white-you'll see Max meet Agent 99 for the first time.Series creators Mel Brooks and Buck Henryyy have recorded commentary for this episode-so you''' watch it over annd over again!In """"A Spy For A Spy""you'll see Max encounttttter Siegfried for thhe first time!YYYou''ll see all the character's debuts-and laughh until you lose control..Whether yyou love the show,spy satire or hyyyyystericqlly funnyyy humor you'll have a ball!"
2,Very hard to maneuver!,We have one umbrella stroller (Graco) and recently purchased this one for dd. It is SOOOO difficult! It is very hard to stear & is just a pain! And apparently not all that comfortable because my 4 year old asks to sit in the plain one over the Dora one! I am so disopointed because it is so cute! :(
4,Spectacular,"First off, it's closer to a four and a half stars. Anyway, when I bought theBeast Wars DVDs, it was because I thought they would be fun to have due tomy enjoyment of them when I was younger. They are even better now, with astunningly spectacular story and a climactic end that is epic to the end.This season also has Depth Charge, the greatest character of the whole saga.Definitely recommended to any sci-fi action fans."
5,The Season That Ends the War,"My thoughts for this season are the same as for the second season of the Beast Wars: A very in-depth, dramatic, intense, suspenseful plot that really captures transformers fans.I'm glad I bought all the seasons, I certainly recommend getting the previous ones before this one if you are interested.A small warning, however: I bought the DVD's for the show and the show only. I don't care for extra features or how the box looks, as long as it's in good condition. This may upset some people who are interested in the DVD set because extra features may mean a lot. Just as a warning, this season is the only one without special features, so hopefully that doesn't convince you not to get this set because it's awesome."
3,A little dissapointing but still good,"SO much potential after the first two amazing seasons but this one is hindered by cramming far too much in and way too many new characters and beast mode changes, as well as the love story seeming to take over the series. Still mahy strong episodes and superb animation. This story arc (no pun intended) could have run over another season. Good just too crammed in."
4,its gooood,"with the conclusion of the maximal's time on earth, and the final defeat of the predicons, the return of dinobot, the appearance of depth charge and the return of tigertron/air razor combo tigerhawk, it is a killer season. not as fun as the second season, or as new and exciting as the first the third IS a great conclusion of the epic saga of maximals versus predicons. long live the spark."
3,good but....,"This was a good season very cool how they mix in the transformers as well. I had one major problem, and that was the upgrades ever show. I just got stupid after a while. worth getting to complete the set, but do not buy if you are some what interested."
4,Puzzle,"This is a great puzzle. I must have overlooked the dimensions when I ordered it, though. I was shocked when I received a big heavy box, at least for a puzzle. My daughter,4, enjoyed putting it together, and it is very well made, although the dog was attracted to it and decided to chew on it. I purchased 3 of the Melissa and Doug puzzles and am very happy with the purchases, just not the dog, lol."
5,Really fun for my 4 year old and her cousin!,"This puzzle turns out to be so much fun for not only my daughter, but her cousin too. It's big enough for them to work on together and not argue about it! My daughter is four so she's not extra careful when putting together ,or taking apart the pieces. With other puzzles this results in some tearing. Not with this one though. The pieces are nice and thick and sturdy, but they still fit together easily so there is no frustration. We love it!"
1,not good quailty------CHEAP,"I bought 2 of these in differentcolors. They were very prettyand were a great price. I paidunder $25.00. But, they do nothold up well. The lining becomesloose and they become lumpy.I would NOT buy themagain."
2,"Great for ten bux, but it was dirty.",I just received the set. One of the pillow cases has a red spot about 4 inch diameter. If i would have paid more than ten bucks it wouldn't be worth. The color is not blue/gold.... it's more of a black/gold color.
1,The Ugliest Thing I Ever Saw,"I ordered this thinking that I'd save a bundle, and have a really nice comforter set. Not! The product description promised Navy and Sage, but it is Black and Sage. It is the cheapest looking comforter that I have ever seen. I sent mine back yesterday--I just can't let the seller get away with the totally inaccurate description and the deception in claiming that this product was originally $200+ dollars."
1,Not up to the mark,"This item was specified as 55% Polyester and 45% Cotton, but this item is 100% polyester, and the wash care was suppose to be "" Dry Clean only "" intead of "" Machine wash "" as advertised.i think amazon shouldnt have these kind of products on their web site which will ruin their reputation of selling good and genuine products."
1,Don't be fooled by the List Price!,"The set is very light-weighted and the quality is poor. I paid one tenth of the list price, but when I received it, I felt I paid too much. Not worth it!"
3,Check Design Carefully,"Product is good but the design wording was better than the design itself. It comes off as black & gold, not the color scheme I had planned."
2,The style has changed,"I've been using this product for years, but the last shipment I received was different. It is not the same product although the name is the same (used to be Serenity/Tena and is now Tena/Serenity). These have a purplish color to them and are inferior to the previous product. These pads now wrinkle while you're wearing them and do not stay in place as before. They are not as comfortable as before. I am shopping around now for an alternative product."
3,The new version Serenity Tena Ultra thin pads is not as good as the old,"I like the older version of this product much better than the newer version. The new version bunches up and doesn't stay in place as well. I don't think it absorbs as well. The older version is white, not purple. I hope the manufactor will return to the older version of this product."
1,Very poor quality...,"These are not like any Tena or Poise pads you can buy in a store. These are like a wad of toilet paper! They remind me of the ""Kotex"" pads we had back in the early 1960's. AND they bunch up/compress into a tight roll. They are just not any good."
4,The best game on the ps2. bar none.,"This game is undeniably the best shooter on the ps2. it is surprisingly deep with weapon choices and customization and is very entertaining to play. i spent more hours than i am willing to admit playing the massive campaign, and even more on its fun and competitive multiplayer. it it truly a great game. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up."
3,It's okay,"If you're into FPS like Halo, Call of Duty, etc. then this game might not be for you. I figured that I'd like it simply due to the fact that it's a shooter, and I was surprised to find out that it's hardly similar to FPS. However, the game was not horrible, and I did play it for a month or so before getting an xbox 360."
3,I've had better,I don't play video games all that much anymore and I really wanted to find a game that everyone was talking about. I had heard a lot about Socom and so I went all out for the newest one - Combined Assault. The graphics are great and the controls aren't too hard to master. The missions are just a little bit slow - maybe because it is just the middle levels of the game. I can definitely see that this would be a really great game to play against your buddies or online.The ABSOLUTE WORST part of this is that you can't play two player. I really think that would have changed the entire experience for me.
2,Interesting but Flawed,"The concept is fascinating and the scenes are graphic, but two things ruin this game: 1) Teammates get stuck in place. You can order them all you like, but they don't do anything. You'll march into a firefight thinking your team is behind you; wrong, they could be stuck in place behind and you're alone. Two, you cannot switch between players."

4,Wintertime Review,"I got this doll for Christmas and I love her! I gave her 4 stars for fun because I have another Jade that isn't the Wintertime Wonderland, and when I went to put Cloe's clothes on Jade the pants diddn't fit. 3 for educatiional because how much can you learn from her except style? 4 for duribality because there are so many piecesThank you for reading my review"
4,Adorable,I bought this toy for my neice and soon after receiving her got one for my 5 yr old daughter. The pack is full of accessories and can stretch the immagination with being at a ski resort. The snow board is just the cuttest. I beleive that your girls would be delighted to receive this.
3,NOT the best...,"Have you seen any of the Bratz movies? I have...My faveorite character is Yazmin...She is cute, cool, tredy and sweet whilst Cloe just likes fashion and is kinda moody...Sasha is also very cool in personality...Cloe is also not the pretiest...Jade is....Look at Jade"
1,A brilliant marketing scheme!,"Okay so I'm not a sheltering parent by ANY stretch of the imagination, but I don't doubt this toy is the most popular thing to hit the market in years. Why? Becuase highly sexualized toys are always the ""coolest"" and ""hippest"" toys out there, just like the highly sexualized and best dressed girls are always the most popular in school. I just couldn'tgive my daughter a doll that looked like the girls who torture other girls in high school...because that's what this toy is! It's a miniature ""popular girl"" all her own, that will always be the best dressed with the coolest accessories and that will never make fun of her. What a great segue into early sexualization and a life of materialism! And if you think I'm just being alarmist, wait till your baby starts asking for tacky clothes, stretch flare jeans and a cell phone...because face it, they're called ""Bratz"" for a reason..."
2,eww,this cloe is hideous her hair is white her lips are glitter brown what a ugly color and her hair is a wild nightmare and that pink shirt ain't workin' for ya honey it makes her look old her outfits are wonderfull but her face my god its ugly get dana yasmin or sasha they are the best from the whole group or get hollywood cloe she has such a pretty face and her curly hair is to die for i love bratz but not this one its an illgeal alien
5,Lots of Winter Fun!,"The new Wintertime Wonderland Bratz are a wonderful new edition to the growing line of dolls! And the clothes!! After opening and examining the delightful wardrobe, I have to rate the durability high on all everything from Cloe's cool new winter coats to the tiny quilted detailing on her red vest. The cordory pants however, I was disappointed in for the belt loops were not sewn on correctly and most of them could be pulled out easily. Also, Cloe's fashionable fuzzy white sweater could be hard for little hands to manipulate over the doll's fingers. Overall, Cloe definetly provides fuel for young imaginations (combined with all of Winter Wonderland collection)with the snowboard and other accessories and is a great collector's item for the child at heart!"
5,GREAT TOY!,I had gotten Wintertime Wonderland Cloe for a Halloween present and I played with her non-stop. Her clothes are so pretty and she has so many accessories. The only thing was I could not put the jacket back on because the sleeves were too puffy and the arms would not go down to her size. It is only educational because it streches your imagination. But buy this toy it is th best!
2,Metal Finish Looks Very Different in Person than in Photo,"I was very disappointed when I opened the box and saw the metal finish on this headboard. It is much darker than it appears in the photo and has gold-toned stripes than are not apparent from the photo. This has taught me a lesson. Some things are better purchased in person. Now, I have to return a huge box by Fed Ex or UPS at my expense and pay a 20% restocking fee."
2,Not all that...,"Very weak and light, can't seem to make it tight enough for it to not wobble. It does the job of looking good and allowing the pillows to rest on it nicely, but never rest your back on it unless it is pressed tightly against the wall:)"
2,Not all that good,"Tai Chi Master was a lot better than this. I was pretty bored watching this movie. No real good moves, just plain boring. I didn't even watch the last 40ish minutes."
1,Horrible the worst Yuen Woo ping movie,I had read the other reviews and people were saying that itwas the best YuenWoo Ping Movie but trust me it isthe worst Yuen Woo Ping movie i had watched the subtitledversion and it was very difficult to followbecause theSubtitles were burnt on to the print.I would not recommend this movie to anyone especially thedubbed version because i know how bad itis please save your money.
4,Yuen Woo Ping Does It Again,"This movie is an excellent and effective combination of comedy, martial arts mastery, likable characters, and rapid-fire action. Although it lacked a solid story--self-taught Tai Chi fighter helping Chinese revolutionaries dressed in English attire butting heads with traditionally clad Chinese militia in cohorts with opium-smuggling English citizens--the well positioned, amazingly choreographed fight scenes are well worth the purchase. Jacky Wu is a fresh face in the world of Hong Kong martial arts movies of today. With his acting and martial arts talent--highly evident in this movie--he is sure to go far."
4,Excellent film one of the best,"This film has alot of martial arts and a story that is not like the other martial arts film, the story keeps you interested and the jokes and comedy are genuinely funny. Buy this film if you like martial arts."
4,Bloody grrrrrrreat!!!!!,A lot of recognisable Taiji techniques. Quite spoofy in places. It really has a go at the West for oppressing the Chinese and i'm sure break-dancing wasn't really invented back then.......
2,One of the worst Woo-Ping movies,"This is a horrible movie especially dubbed in english,although I haven't seen the sub-titled version which probabley isn't as silly,I doubt it's much better.So what's so bad,hmm,let's see,no plot,un-interesting characters,and some not so funny punch-lines.The fights are ok, but definitley sub-standard for YUEN.I definitley cannot reccomend the dubbed version,but it's possible that the Chinese one sports a better plot."
2,Lackluster Performances,"This is not as good as the other Tai Chi movies. Unpolished, poor gongfu spoils the good parts. The ending is especially weak... the sudden appearance of ""string"" aided stunts makes it laughable in a bad way. The lack of a good villian is sure to kill any decent movie, and the bad guys are really subpar in Tai Chi II.Likewise, I am unimpressed with the storyline... it starts off as a ""girl-meets-boy"" who already has boyfriend plot and tries to become an old vs. new China (opium wars) flick. Additionally, the young kungfu master goes through no personal jouney (training/failure/rivalry) - I guess I just didnt find it too interesting.Pass and buy another one in the TAI CHI series."
5,"Understand My Muslim People, by Abraham Sarker","I appreciate this book immensely. Having done medical work in several Muslim countries, this book helped much in understanding better the variety of experiences I encountered. Dr. Sarker's personal journey certainly illustrates God's faithfulness to all mankind. I especially liked his excellent treatise on the roots of Islam and his comparison of Islam and Christianity, both similarities and differences. It raised further wonderings, questions I'd love to pose to Dr. Sarker. I hope he writes a sequel. I have purchased more copies to share with others. Kenneth K. Magee, MD"
5,Great Information on Muslims,"The author tells the amazing story how he came to know Christ and how it cost him everything. He then give facts about the Muslim faith, which are very informative. It's one of the best books I've read on this topic."
2,What?,"After reading the above review written by K-Tel Records, I thought this album might be South Beach versions of old favorites. But no. It's priced very intelligently. Rated 2 stars for it's twist on the idea that elevators have music."
5,Great for Homeschool Co-op,I used this for homeschool co-op class.There is pre-reading ideas and the book is broke into 5 sections. So you can do projects in reading of every 3-4 chapters. There is quiz and journal topics. And Post reading ideas.
4,Hilarious but caution should be exercised with some adult scenarios,"Very funny movie, but of course most Steve Martin movies are funny. I am watching the Parenthood TV series, and wanted to see if the movie was anything like the series. It was fun to compare the movie's four siblings to the series four siblings. I enoyed the moive a lot. However, I gave it four stars because of some foul language and some inapporpriate sexual content. I loved Cowboy Billy. Martin was really his ""wild and crazy guy"" at his son's birthday parry. I think that scene was the best in the whole movie. I would use caution with young teens. Overall, the family dynamics were fun and loving and even though the family fought over some issues, they forgave each other eventually. The movie was entertaining, believable, fun and left me with a good feeling by the time the credits came around."
5,Ron Howard tells family life as he knows it best!,"Ever since little Ronnie Howard first showed up on TV back in the 1950's we knew there were great things ahead for him! He grew up on the other side of the television screens of most of us and he listened and he learned. He became a director because that's where his heart lies. He knows people and based on his own personal experiences with his family he knows how they interact. The hilarious side of the family unit (as well as pathos and sadness) is here in Parenthood and combined with excellent casting this film is a role model for every family, no matter where they live! Ron Howard is now highly respected as a director and a human being as well! We love you Ronnie!"
2,"Great movie, horrible transfer","I was excited for the blu ray release of this film. The extras looked promising and I was looking forward to a much crisper version than my dvd could provide. The transfer is awful I want to say that my dvd copy looked better, it was very grainy at times and not crisp at all. I realize this is an older film but seriously this transfer was bad. I am not an expert on clarity or quality by any means but if it looks worse than the dvd something is wrong.The extras included a fun little making of feature with cast interviews from while it was being filmed. I love the movie and just expected more from this release. Wait for a better transfer before upgrading from dvd."
