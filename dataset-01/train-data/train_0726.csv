2,Kind of a let down,"I thought this movie would be as good as the Batman and the Redhood movie, but it wasn't even close. This movie could had just been a regular episode of the JLA TV series.This movie failed to keep my attention many times. I just couldn't get into it. It seemed too well scripted to the point, you know the JLA will just find a easy way to fix all the stuff that is hurting them. Then, it happened. Every member of the JLA that had fallen to the Evil bad guy team, came back very easily...too easily.Half way though the movie, I pretty much wanted this movie to end. It was so boring to watch. After the half way point. I already knew that the JLA will just go find the evil team of super villains and take them out with ease. Which was exactly what happened.People should just rent this one. It's worth a rental but not a buy."
2,Great Expectations,"It wasn't all I hoped it would be. This movie could have and should have been a lot better, but so many plot holes and head scratchers leave you well, scratching your head. If you absolutely have to see it, don't or get some sucker to buy it and lend it to you - not worth the money."
3,What If...,"Decent enough movie but it lacked some of the luster of previous JLA themed movies but being a collector of all things Wonder Woman and some DC characters and memorabilia, it is a must have."
4,more more more,"I've already watched this twice. My all time fav super hero is the Bat. Can't have enough of him. He was great in this feature. I suppose, the only reason I didn't give this a 5 star is *SPOILER ALERT* I wish a little more of the background of how the Legion of Doom were able to figure out that Batman had this contingency plan. I suppose, just knowing your enemy, it should be enough, but I wanted more of an explanation.Also, I'm just tired of the old kryptonite, to make the fight against Superman a challenge. Just gets old.Keep on bringing it DC!"
3,Kind of Meh,"My review of this is relative. Not as good as ""Batman/Superman - Apocalypse"" or ""Batman: Under the Red Hood"". Not as good as ""Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths"". Kind of bland and boring in comparison."
5,Fabulous... one of the best!,"A long awaited movie, the last from the esteemed Dwayne McDuffie and a fine example of his work. I highly recommend this movie for any comics fan!"
3,The artwork needs work,"Given the artwork shown on the cover, I was immensely disappointed with the artwork in the film. That said, the story was okay, all-be-it overdone retelling of immobilizing Superman with a kryptonite bullet to the chest. The high point of the film was the cast, all of the voice actors did credit to their roles, most of which have performed these characters in the past. Not bad for a rental but hardly a piece I would invest money to add to my collection of films."
2,PURCHASE JLA (Book 7): Tower of Babel by Mark Waid INSTEAD,"Just finished streaming Justice League: Doom. Trust me on this. Purchase the trade paperback JLA Book 7; read the comics. Rent it or stream it if you are so inclined but don't buy the DVD. The movie is loosely based on Mark Waid's well-received 'Tower of Babel' storyline. It's dramatic, gripping and thought provoking. I don't want to spoil the story because I can not compare the DVD to the comic book without revealing too many details from both. However there are quite a few changes & alterations from the original source material which appear to be done just to coincide with the reboot of DC's Justice League comic book series. For $10 dollars you can purchase the complete Tower of Babel story which this DVD is based on.This is a great read.JLA (Book 7): Tower of BabelJustice League: Doom is a so-so film."
1,sooooo annoyed,been buying Dc animation series and films from the states because the not sold in ireland and this is the first one to actually be protected by a region code :( was really looking forward to watching it
1,avoid ultraviolet digital copies,I have emailed flixster several times since the beginning of the year and no response. I will therefore try to make my voice heard here. Avoid any ultraviolet product like the plague. Difficult to use and terrible customer support.
1,love the movies----hate UV!!,"I have greatly greatly enjoyed the DTV DC movies. However, this UV copy thing is a complete and utter joke!!! As many others have said, you basically don't get a digital copy at all. Most of the time I watch a digital copy of something is on a plane with my laptop or iPAD. I think the term COMBO PACK is extremely misleading. What they mean to say is ""pay extra money and we'll sell you a blu-ray and some swampland in Florida!"" No thanks UV copy."
3,Justice League: Doom summay,"What I seen from the up coming trailer is Vandal Savage is behind a plot to assassinate the Justice League, buy hiring quite a few villains, that include, Bain, Queen from the Royal Flush gang, Cheetah and Star Sapphire, just to name a few. I look forward to purchase this DVD for my collection."
1,Short and Sweet,I've purchased the DVD or Blue-ray combo of nearly every DC animated presentation so far. I won't be buying this because of the Ultraviolet digital copy. I'll be renting instead.
5,One of a Series of Victoria CDs by Hill and the Westminsters,"Over the years, from the mid-1980s, beginning (I believe) with 'O Magnum Misterium' and 'Ascendens Christus in Altum,' David Hill and the Westminster Cathedral Choir have recorded a good number of Victoria's motets and masses. All of the performances I've heard, including this CD of 'O Quam Gloriosum' and 'Ave Maris Stella,' some of Victoria's most beloved music, are stunningly sung and recorded. The Westminster Choir's boy trebles give these performances an ethereal quality that raises these performances above the usual level. This is astonishingly beautiful music in remarkably effective performances by these forces. I would also heartily recommend the others in the series.This is music and these are performances that people who don't ordinarily like classical music, or people who aren't particularly religious, can listen to and enjoy endlessly.Highly recommended.Scott Morrison"
5,Singing as no other,"All Hyperion productions are of the highest level. This one is no exception. Excellent, atmospheric sound with David Hill, a master of post renaissance music, leading the Westminster Cathedral Choir in an great performance of some of Victoria's best known music. The excellence of the production was awarded with a Gramophone award. If you listen to it you will know why."
2,Nothing to Whirl about,"Julian Morris (Cry Wolf, Young Arthur) stars as James a young boy who hires a Whirlygirl (Exotic Dancer) one night to entertain him and a bunch of his friends in a secret little place since it's prohibited on school grounds. Once the Whirlygirl played by Monet Mazur (Torque, 40 Days & 40 Nights) leaves James soon finds out that she has taken a valuable watch from him. So, he asks the head of the school if he can leave to go get the watch and he'll return before curfew. James tracks down the Whirlygirl at her apartment in which he soon starts to fall for her (as usual). Interesting look but there's nothing really here to get excited about. Mazur is beautiful and Morris gives a dull performance. Also starring Daniel Franzese (Bully, Mean Girls) and a surprising appearance by David Garrison (Married With Children, Op Center) as one of Mazur's customers. Well it was surprising to see him but he didnt have that much to do really. This gets a ** out of ****"
5,A must have for any respectible hot rodder,"hey if you've got yourself a nice 50's hot rod, then you need this cd, roll down the windows and blast this, you'll feel so cool at every stoplight1 Great music about cars. Every style from r&b, to rockabilly is here and all the songs are uptempo and purrfect for cruisin' baby!!!"
1,Don't waste your time,"Essentially a picture of a clock pasted to a piece of rigid foam with a cheap mechanism, this clock was not worth paying for. Packaged nicely but the hands were bent and the mechanism didn't work at all. It was back in the box and on it's way to the return desk the same day."
2,A Cheap Imitation,"This clock looks good a distance. However, a closer inspection reveals a very cheaply made imitation. Based on the materials, I would expect to pay about $50 for this clock. That would still leave a nice profit for the manufacturer. If you don't mind getting gouged and you will be hanging the clock out of the range of scrutinizing eyes, the clock is adequate."
3,DOES NOT HAVE ALL PINS AS PICTURES,"This adapter DOES NOT have all the pins in the picture. While it will provide basic DVI-VGA/DSub connection you can forget getting full support from this adapter. seems sturdy enough, good value for the price if your just looking to add an extra monitor or need to use a older dsub/vga monitor on a more modern DVI out graphics card."
3,An OK Album,"As I'm sure you know, Steve Gaines was a member of Lynyrd Skynyrd for a short time. He was killed in the unfortunate plane crash. This CD includes some songs that he made before joining Skynyrd. It's not great, but not bad either. The title song, ""One In The Sun"" and the cover of ""It's Alright"" are pretty good, but the rest are mostly just so and so. This album is hard to find, and usually expensive. I don't think it's really worth the high amounts that some people want for it (someone on ebay wants $150!), but if you want it, you'll have to spend a little extra. I usually see the LP for about $30 and the CD for $70 to $150; get the LP. [Update]: On may 2nd, an import copy of this album is going to be available for only about $17.00! So it's your choice; A: Pay $70-$150 for the CD, B: Pay $20-$30 for the LP, or C: Wait until May 2nd and pay only $17. Not great, but a good effort, Steve. And your contributions to Skynyrd are very noticable on ""Street Survivors"". Fly on, Freebird."
1,can't play game,"This game was for my seven yr old,but it was sent without instructions,so no one knows how to play it."
2,Sorely Disappointing,"This game is, in my opinion, terrible. I found it vaguely amusing for the first...five minutes, but after that it was all downhill. The graphics are decent and the controls are easy to learn, but the game just feels like a task. Jump onto this platform, get the scooby snack there, jump on this monster here and Zoiks! What a monotonous nightmare. The levels are in a linear format that is often frustrating and makes some camera angles awkward. Collecting ""scooby snacks"" gets annoying, and you see the same monsters over and over again. The voiceovers are great, but what good is a voiceover if the game is weak?People who might like this game:~Kids just learning how play play video games~Diehard scooby fansPeople who might not like this game:~Everybody else."
1,Dark and dreary,"I confess I didn't get very far on this game before I quit and put it up for sale, but I intensely dislike games where you have to go back to an area and finish it after you've acquired additional skills somewhere else. And the camera angles are really bad. It's difficult to position Scooby for jumps and you can't see some areas you think you need to. I went to the mansion, the playground, the fishing village, the vault, and some area that might have been a cemetery and apparently the sun never comes out in Scoobyland because each level was dark and dreary. After I earned a warp power, it turned out there was no place I could warp to. Very frustrating. And you don't have much directional control of Scooby when he's supposed to be swinging on something."
2,Ruh-Roh!!!,Ruh-Roh for Scooby-Doo. How can you call that a game the graphics are horrible and the control is terrible.The voice overs are really bad too.It just so bad even Simon Cowell couldn't figure out critisizum for it. It is so bad I can't find the words for it. So I am going to stop writing this report.
4,THE BEST SCOOBY-DOO GAME EVER!!,This is the best Gamecube game so far. It is very fun and challenging. I love it!!!!!
2,Doesn't work on some gamecubes,"With a brand new disc...would have been nice if it worked but it didn't. Apparently some incompatibility exists between certain gamecubes and this game.THQ acknowledges that and asked me to go to Nintendo. Nintendo says to send in this game AND the gamecube. Will take about 4 weeks.Luckily, THQ was nice enough to offer me the xbox version to exchange for."
4,THE BEST SCOOBY-DOO GAME SO FAR!!,This is one of the best Gamecube game so far. it is very fun and challenging!
4,Pretty darn good game,"This game is one of the best i've played for the gamecube so far. It's challenging, has a nice plot, takes a fair amount of time to complete, and has some comical elements as well. Some areas of the game are so challenging they're frustrating, and you'll be so happy when you get through it you'll quickly run to a mystery machine to save the game so you don't have to go through it again. It challenges you to think about how to get some of the monster tokens and some of the scooby snacks. The puzzles aren't super difficult, but they do give a fair amount of difficulty. i really like the cut scenes in the game; they remind me so much of the cartoon and they're cool. The only thing that keeps me from giving the game a perfect 5 stars is that all of the bosses (except for the mastermind) are too easy to defeat. everything else about the game is exceptional. The game is definitely worthy for buying."
5,Great battery operated rotozip,"Bosch 18v blue core tools are great, the batterys last forever and they are durable...highly recomend"
1,Terrible!!,"Humanely, politically, and ethically incorrect. Bedtime stories should not have to followed up with explainations and corrections. Some of these ""treasuries"" gave me chills."
4,Great performance by One of 20th. Century's Best Sitarya,"I very much like Panditji's performance of raag Desh.As one of the few well known sitar playing representatives of the Senia gharana, Pt. Debu Chaudhuri is an important musician. But he is also one of the best sitarists of the 20th. Century, in my opinion (along with Ravi Shankar, Vilayat Khan, Nikhil Banerjee, Budhaditya Mukherjee, Manilal Nag, Rais Khan, and perhaps Shahid Parvez)."
4,Nice Greatest Hits Disc,"John Lennon certainly had a prolific career with many many successful beatles and solo records. The John Lennon Collection offers 19 solid tracks from his solo tenure that spanned from 1969 to 1980. Although I believe John Lennons' Imagine is his best solo work, and probably a must have, this is also a fine cd offering most of his hits from his other albums. My favorite tracks on the disc are Give Peace A Chance, Whatever Gets You Thru The Night, Imagine and Watching The Wheels. If you like the Beatles or John Lennon at all, this will be a rewarding purchase."
5,The only John Lennon CD you'll ever need.,"This CD has all of John's best post-Beatles stuff on it. Dispite the fact that he produced music for a decade (taking about 4 years off) after the demise of the Fab Four and his Untimely Demise, the sad truth is that his best work fits on a single CD. Don't waste your time and money on any of the regular albums (except, perhapse Imagine, and Plastic Ono Band) because you get all (or almost all) of the good stuff here."
1,"5 star music, but this is a one star collection!","OK bear with me. Before you look at the one star, read the review.John Lennon's genius is put to ill use in this collection. There is no attempt at chronology, the liner notes...wait, what liner notes! There is an abysmal idea of sequence, I mean ""Cold Turkey is a phenomenal song, but making it the last cut? Why? Couldn't they find something a bit more uplifting? This is a slapdash effort and probably put together just to cash in. Lennon's legacy deserves better."
3,it's ook,"It's ok not that Great, you get what you pay for. I wish the seat was a little longer though."
2,"Came missing ALL the bolts, washers, and nuts",Pretty freakin' hard to appreciate a product that comes missing all the parts needed for actual assembly. I contacted Amazon and was told to contact the maker. The maker took my call and promised delivery in 7 to 10 days.Sigh.
4,Does the Job!,"This is a great little bench! Setup took about 15 minutes. The instructions were clear and each part easily identified. It feels really sturdy and has a nice decline position. The small problem I had is that it came with some silver stickers reading ""SB410"" that were peeling and flaking which takes away from the looks. Looks didnt really play a big part in my purchase anyway though. I would definitely recommend it. Actually one of my buddies tried to buy it off me already! No my brother, you gots to get your own!"
5,Great bench - but buy it somewhere else,"This is a great bench for working out your Abdominal muscles. It is compact and sturdy, and gives you an option for decline sit-ups. Check our your local Play It Again Sports where it is sold new every day for between $50-60."
4,good workout bench,Great workout bench for the price. Well constructed and easy to build. Also has convenient place for storage of dumbell weights and two positions for crunches. Only wish the board area was a little longer but overall good product.
1,Crunch Board,"Poorly made, some parts were cracked or broken and unit was not level. Needed my husband to drill other holes to get it to work correctly and to add things to balance unit so it would not rock."
4,Great Bench,Great product but had to stretch the floor grips to get them in. Took some work but def worth it
2,Not well made,"It wasn't very expensive. It is getting the job done. But the feet that came in the kit were impossible to get on. I'm a very handy person, but I just couldn't get the feet to slide onto the ends of the legs. Tried lubricant, tried trimming the inside of the foot with a dremil tool. Eventually, with my frustration meter pegged, I just tried to beat one of them on. It broke. Since I'm using the bench on carpet it's not a big deal, but it wouldn't work on a solid surfaced floor, screw heads would get in the way."
3,"Pretty Good ,but could be a lot better","The Good -The machine was purchased specifically for doing sit ups and crunches and it functions pretty well for that . It can be assembled quickly and is sturdy .The Bad - The back support is just too short by about 6"" and padding could be much better .A slightly larger seat and back support board would make this significantly more functional and comfortable."
2,Not the best,Not adjustable and the pads for your legs keep moving in-between use. Hurts my behind because I can't lower it enough.
3,Enchanted Italy,"While a bit dated, these segments on travel in Italy with Rudy Maxa are enjoyable. The selection of sites is a bit limited, although Mr. Maxa does tend to cover a lot of territory in a short time. His visit to the Chique Terre was brief and focused on the villages, so those interested in the beautiful walking trail between the villages will be disappointed. The ""extras"" included are very brief and provide little additional information, so if you are a regular viewer of Rudy Maxa's public television series, you will find nothing new here. His discussion of air travel consolidators is good and, if you are interested in this topic, may be worth the purchase of the DVD."
2,"If you have Rudy's other DVDs, don't bother with this one!",This DVD is a repackaged/remixed version of his other two France travel DVDs. I was disappointed to see the exact episodes that we already have under different titles.
5,nice price,water is clear after 6 months still. Keeps water clean and clear. Great for turtle tanks and works very well.
2,Battery was dead on arrival,"I loved the look of this watch and have been wearing it almost daily since I received it, however- I was very upset that the battery was dead when it arrived. The money I saved from buying online was lost due to the $14.00 cost of a new battery at my local jewelery store. The watch was sold in new condition and sellers need to be sure their product works as advertised before they ship it!!! A ""new"" watch should have a ""new"" battery in it."
1,review on Seiko Women's watch SXGJ75,"I had a very bad experience with this product. When I received the watch, it was not working. I asked the company to exchange this. They sent me another watch and I mailed back the bad watch to them. To my surprise, I found this exchanged watch was also a bad one. It stopped working after 3/4 days. I cannot simply believe this. I have been shopping using Amazon for a long time. Bought many watches in past 5 years. Never received a bad watch (which is supposed to be a brand new Seiko women's watch) for the second time. I would ask for my money back this time. I won't recommend anyone to buy this particular model Seiko watch from MisterOnline."
5,A brave story,This book is a brave story of an ex-cult member who struggles her way out and into her life. It is courages story with lots of adventure.
4,the blunt truth,"What can I say about the Juggalo Show box set? You have to really love ICP to even consider listening to this box set.The first two shows in this set don't even have any of their music. What music is actually on it ICP is commenting on and really disrespecting the music while it is playing. Yes it is funny. And there are other funny parts on these but unless you are really some one who gets their sense of humor it is not for you. The third show in this series has one of their songs at the very end of the second CD. I actually really love the song, so that was great. But the best show in this series was the last one that did not get played on the radio. You would have to get this box set to see what I mean, because I will not give that part away. All that I can say is that it is totally awesome."
2,"Concerns Ballard's novel, not Cronenberg's movie","Sinclair all but ignores David Cronenberg's adaptation of ""Crash,"" focusing instead on Ballard's novels ""Crash"" and ""The Atrocity Exhibition."" Unfortunately, he offers little fresh insight into these seminal works.The BFI series are supposed to be about FILMS, not the novels that inspired them.The RE/Search volume on J. G. Ballard still remains the best introduction to his work, rendering Sinclair's book unnecessary."
4,Hibel,"I am among those who like the work of Edna Hibel, especially her Asian pieces. This book shows work that I have not seen."
1,Not a good option,"Be very, very careful with this software. I installed it, and suddenly Photoshop crashed every time I tried to open it. The Quick Start Guide provides very insufficient information with no warnings or instructions on how to backtrack after making mistakes (and mistakes are likely without better instructions. And hey, the company phone number listed in the user's guide --- it's some poor guy's private phone number. A detail the company overlooked. What other details are they overlooking?"
3,Good starter telescope,"The smaller eyepiece for finding the object you want is easier to use than the larger for detailed viewing, but this is a very nice starter telescope for your kids."
2,Doesnt work at night??,It was an easy assemble process and I have used it during the day and it works just fine but for some reason (manufacture error or my own) at night you cant see a thing weither the sky is totally clear or not. Since the sole purpose of purchasing this product was to look at stars and planets I consider this a waste of money...
1,Horrible beginner telescope,This is a horrible beginner telescope. I guess this is why the price was so cheap. We got it for our 11 year old daughter for Christmas and she was so disappointed with it. We could not even see the moon with it. We followed all the instructions and could not spot a single object. What a disappointment.
1,So bad products,"I am so ungry y sad, because was birhtday gifs to my son; this telescope has very bad focus, is impossible seen the moon, less the planets, more bad impossible.Celestron thanks for nothing"
3,good enough for the money,My husband has been wanting something better than his binoculars to see the moon and stars. He is satisified with this purchase. Not amazing but good enough for basics.
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this telescope with the idea to use to see the moon with it, and maybe do a little bird watching, and things like that. Well, it came with some nice software to track the planets and stars with. The software is far more interesting than the telescope, and it gave me false hope that this telescope was good for seeing some of the larger planets, maybe. It works fine during daylight hours, but at night there is not enough light, even when focused on a street light! The tripod fell apart the second day. I have yet to be contacted by customer support at [...] I do not think the listed price at the store of $200 for this model was accurate. Perhaps it is time to return it and get my money back."
2,great for the moon... horrible for deep space objects,If it gathered more light and the barlow lens worked... it'd be okay.only jupiter is visible.Moon is perfect.dont buy... save $300 more and get a much brighter system F4.5 this is F12 and is dim as hell... nearly useless for all the deep space objects....!!!! Barlow lens claims to triple the power but it messes up the focusing of the whole system and it thus doesnt work!Dodge this product like the Zombie Plague!!!
3,good telescope for kids,Gave this to my daughter for her birthday.She really enjoys it.Good entry level scope for kids that's not too expensive.
5,Great telescope for the price!!,The telescope arrived in a timely manner. My husband and daughter enjoy looking at the stars and the moon. It is a great telescope for the price.
4,Review of The Daily Walk NIV bible,A very easy to navigate bible with wonderful explanations and summaries of chapters. It is one of the best bibles I have every purchased.
5,WOW,I already knew what a wonderful Bible this is. I bought this one for a friend after she had seen mine (which was given to me by a friend). It is the most helpful and understandable edition I have ever seen. Written in every day language with questions and comments made to make you really think. It is set up to be able to read the Bible in one year. The shipping was super fast too. Thanks.
5,Great For Smaller Spaces,"Crystal clear monitor, it takes up hardly any space. I've had this monitor for a year now and never had any problems with it, it's so thin and the picture quality seems perfect to me, I love it!"
5,Nice Picture,If you still are using older hardware and need a monitor that will work with the VGA plug this is a good choice. Of course it has no sound so just realize that when you use VGA you still need external speakers.
3,Re-built monitor,"For $65.00 I got what I paid for. Next time, I'll just pay the difference andget something better than a weak screen."
2,Not So Crisp,"It's a decent monitor. I got as a hand-me-down and it definitely would not be my first pick. I use it as an external display for my 13"" MacBook Pro and the difference in quality between the two is quite noticeable. The laptop's screen is crisp and the colors are vibrant.The Dell's colors are off and it's impossible to calibrate the screen to apple standards, the image is grainy, it's not wide screen and it has the same number of vertical pixels as my laptop."
1,Waste of money,"It was my mistake in thinking that when it said it had a 17"" display, that's what I would get. It was 13"" across, 17"" diagonally. Much too small for me. It was packed very well, but the monitor was not in the ""very good"" shape the seller claimed. The screen was very smeared with streaks and the monitor cord looked like it had been almost completely chewed through by a mouse.I contacted the seller about returning it for a full refund and expected they would pay the shipping, but they never offered. Finding out that the shipping would cost me half the price of the monitor, I decided to keep it."
5,Perfect size!,"These are the perfect size for our little toy poodle. Some are thicker than others and offer variety, but he loves them all. After his breakfast and playtime, he gets one to enjoy so we can enjoy our breakfast without interruptions. He will wait by the cupboard where I keep them when he's had enough play and let me know he is ready to relax a bit. So cute! He doesn't even eat a whole one all day, but will pick it up from time to time for a quick chew. At the end of the day I throw that one away and he gets a fresh one next morning. There seem to be about 15 to 20 in the package so they last several weeks which makes them a good value as well.UPDATE:2-12-2013 I just opened a new pack and I counted 23 not including 3 that I thought were too small for him and threw out. Good deal"
4,GREAT,My husband bought this Ill at EaseMark of Cain around 4 years ago and he loves it and still plays it
3,Foot hits the hitch,"I just got this bike trailer from Craigslist last night and was very impressed with its solid construction and maneuverability. I also liked that it did not need a receiver mounted on the bike like our old Instep bike trailer had, so we could switch between my bike and my wife's easily. We went for our fist ride tonight to try it out and I am not impressed with the way it mounts to my bike. I am not too afraid of it coming off as it seemed fine in that regard, but the big black knob to tighten the clamp is in the way of my heal. I am surprised I haven't read about anyone else having this problem. I had to ride with my tennis shoes because my bike shoes wouldn't let me turn my foot out to avoid contact with the mount. I am thinking about retrofitting it to just have a hex head bolt to tighten it to get rid of the big black knob. Anyone else have an issue with this?"
1,Terrible design,There is no point in purchasing this product. I cant get a block down the subdivision sidewalk before it falls off. I was prepared to purchase a Chariot product for twice as much but when I saw Chariot designed this product I took the bait. I really wish I hadn't. I thought the attachment was a really good idea but it has turned out to be the worst part of the stroller. I basically cant use it until I figure something out.
3,Lots of good stuff and lots of not so good ...,"The collection consists of many wonderful musicals as well as many not so wonderful ones. Review the list of titles and see if you wouldn't be ahead to purchase only those individual features you don't already own and that are of interest to you. Virtually everything in the set is available as an individual title and can be purchased, in many cases, brand new for $5 or less. For those excellent titles in the collection I would give rating of 5 stars for those lesser titles maybe a 1 star - thus resulting in a 3 star for the entire collection. The price would indicate that you are paying for the speciality packaging and the availability of buying all these titles in a single purchase - still not a great value in my opinion."
4,A Comic Chronicle of Failure.,"The book covers 60 notable lemons - from the Pinto to the Trabant to the Tucker. Some of the cars were great sellers, but were complete garbage, others were just complete failures in design and the market.The book is written with a bit of an edge, and there are comic elements. This is a history and business book, however, not a joke book. The author does a fine job of explaining why each of the cars are in the book, and the design, marketing and financial errors that underpin each lemon.Each car has at least one photo, and the narrative on each ranges from 2-3 well written, concise and entertaining pages. If you have interest in the subject, the book is worth picking up."
2,Not what I expected,"A very short book, short little blurbs about his idea of a 'lemon'....there are MANY more cars that come to mind. Obviously British, as most of the cars here we have never seen in the USA. Didn't take long to read and you're done. Not a book you'll look back to, kind of a one-time thing. Expected more pictures, writing. At least I got a used copy, not too much expense."
2,"elegant & nice weight, but will not last","I hate to be the one to write the first bad review, but feel I need to. I purchased this set and received it in January 2011, it is now June 2011 and I have rust and white pit marks on 4 of the pieces.Upon purchase I really liked the set, very elegant and excellent weight, very attractive. I don't use the set very regularly (maybe once a week), but keep it stored in a regular silverware drawer. Having not used the set in about the past month I had a friend set the table last night and as he was pulling everything out he noticed large pit marks and rust on each knife, and small rust spots on a couple of the forks.Again, I want to like this set and do, but am terribly disappointed about the pit marks and rust. While still usable right now I fear I'll need to replace the set in the next couple of months."
2,"This should really be titled ""Sheena Easton: Some Hits""","So many of Sheena's bona-fide hits are omited from this album that people looking forward to a true ""Greatest Hits"" collection from this marvelous artist will be disappointed. The REAL greatest hits album from Sheena Easton is entitled ""The Singles Collection: The World of Sheena Easton"". Check it out."
2,Catchy&average,most of her material is just catchy.strut for instance was better in 85 but is very dated sounding now.Morning train&for your eyes only are solid Adult-COntempary stables.only The Prince Penned Sugar Walls showcases Her Youth and that song hasn't dated well either.but it was catchy just like most of her stuff in the 80's.
5,The Best of Sheena Easton,I really enjoy listening to this CD. It has all the songs she made popular in the 80s.
4,Excellent story. Almost as good as A Fire Upon the Deep,"A very good sci-fi story. Not quite as good as his last novel, but a very good tale all the same."
4,Great Sci-Fi!,"This is my idea of great science fiction- new ideas and thoughts, an epic scale and setting, characters that actually develop and change, and are complex (although the bad guys do have a bit of a Dirk Dastardly tint), and situations that are not always black-and-white. My only complaint is the ending, which is an orgy of good happily triumphing over evil in such an overwhelmingly sappy way it was almost Scooby-Dooian in nature."
1,"Like the OnOff Star, Off mostly","Reading this book filled me with desperation - it was way too long. My guess is that Vinge must have been paid by the word. Also, it is really hard to believe (and, yes, I know this is science fiction!) that any human civilization this homicidal and avaricious would make it to Mars, never mind to another star. That is, this novel gives two and only two motives for interstellar travel: to peddle wares or to conquer and plunder."
2,Getting to the point takes 85% of the book,"The story unfolds slowly, you read through most of it getting a mesh of names, things that happen, and background feel.You arrive to the ""climax"", and start to grasp what is happening, suddenly people make sense and the story unfolds.Both there is little to this story to make it more than an interesting idea.Sorry I didn't have fun reading this book, I kept reading as I like the author, and I was hoping things would change.Too bad it didn't.Hope you enjoy it more than I do."
4,"serious writer, but mabee too serious for the ganre","why to read the book :1. it starts with dedication for paul anderson - it means that the book writing is in a way, a follow up to the late paul anderon books : the trader society concept,the discovery of new species, pham trinily chracter (remind me nicholas van rein).2. the plot is very thrilling and has a good pace, except for the spider scenes.3. the detailed description of the spider world and the emergent and queng-ho habitat.why not to read :1. cause it's too long, about 800 pages.2. cause the spiders are not convincing, and not interesting."
1,Tiresome,"I looked at some other reviews for A DEEPNESS IN THE SKY, and I found that despite the high average rating, a few other readers shared my poor feelings. I found the book troublesome because too much of the prose was vague. Often in the back of my mind, I had questions: ""What does this character do? Where is this? What's going on?"" It was as if the author was too timid to come right out and explain things; as if there was some mystical sophistication in being uncertain and making readers draw their own definitive conclusions.The vocabulary was not above me, nor was the syntax Shakespearean and obscure. I just get fed up with WONDERING, when I wanted to UNDERSTAND."
5,Excelllent world building,"Like Vinge's other books, I found this to be not ideal for light bedtime reading (the way the book is written requires you to pay attention and think about what you're reading to get the full effect), but it was excellent. Multiple plot-lines, the inclusion of many characters that aren't obvious ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"", several complex yet understandable human and non-human cultures, and a good exploration of the murky ethical delimas of advancing technology all combine to create a well-woven web. Highly recommended to anybody looking for a non-formulaic SF tale."
5,Incredible.,"Simply one of the best science fiction books I've ever read. Truly original and filled with, surprise!, emotion. Yes emotion. I was really touched by the plight of the spider civilization and the story was just great."
3,A good read for the beach this summer.,"Thank goodness Vinge isn't one of these annoying authors who has to plaster an epic across THREE five-hundred plus page volumes! A Deepness is a pretty good book, if not exactly taut. Basically this book is Space Opera toned down enough to make it attractive to modern audiences.Nonetheless, despite the a pretty well realized layer-upon-layer-of-betrayal plot and hokey anthromorphization of the aliens (behind which is a subtle betrayal by a human character which I won't give away here), this is a pretty thin gruel in several places.This book won the Hugo, which gives you an idea of the quality of the writing, which is quite good. However, the total lack of characterization for the ""bad guys"", flat characters, two or three extra (pointless) digressions and just endless explication would have made a much better 250 page novel."
4,"A very good read, but wait for the paperback, if you can.","A good long read. A little jumpy, expecially if you read a little each day. One of those stories told from a multiple of persectives where you always want to get back to the other and then when you do you want to get back to the other. Very hard to put down, many a long night and longer days waiting to continue. Sherkaner (spider) and his family were well characterized. I had no problem imagining Anachna (the spider world) and its on/off star (200 years of darkness and cold/50 years of light and warmth). You have the two human sides The Qeng Ho (good) and the Emergents (evil). All in all a great cast of characters vividly portrayed in a suspensful page turning story."
3,"Way too long, but worth reading.","This would have been a great 300 page book. There just isn't enough story here to justify the almost 800 page length of this book. I loved Fire Upon the Deep and I feel that this prequel doesn't measure up. Also, the evil characters are a bit too over-the-top for me. But still, Vernor Vinge is a very good writer, and this book would have been great with more editing!"
2,Don't Read This Book First,"Until I read the reviews here, didn't realize this was the prequel to another book. That would explain my problem with ""Deepness"". Not only was it confusing, I really didn't care about any of the characters. Were parts of the book good? Absolutely. Did it drone on too long. Yes! Except for the spiders, I found myself not caring if everyone else died."
2,Boring,"Long and slow developing. To be fair I gave up on it about 1/3 of the way through. I had very high expectations after reading ""A Fire Upon the Deep"". Wow, what a disappointment!"
2,avid sci fi reader,"I have read sci fi for over fifty years. This book was long and tedious. The characters were boring and the aliens were like something out of a childrens book.There was some good ideas in the book but failed to hold my interest.Save your time and money. If you want really great science fiction, try Jack Vance's Planet of Adventure. My alltime favorite."
1,Plot Development Painfully Slow,"I really wanted to like this novel. I read until page 265 when I finally lost patience with it. I found the characters, civilizations, aliens and general setting to be boringly drab. The plot took forever to play out. Dialogue was dull and predictable. Basically, stay away from this novel. If you want to read good hard sci-fi pick up something by Arthur C. Clarke."
1,Too deep---way too long!,"OK, I suppose this must be a great book, if all of the awards it has received are on the money. Problem is, I thought is was boring as heck. It moves at a snail's pace, and the characters are not all that interesting. The first two hundred pages held my interest, but then the plot became transparent. Even with the switching around from world to ship to world, everything just bogged down. I had to go into skim and scan mode to get by the next few hundred pages and then fast scan and burn to turn got me through the rest of it. NOT recommended unless you are into a long long slow moving read."
2,Unreadable,"This is an overlong book made worse by sloppy writing. The same distant, cold style is used for both technical descriptions and supposedly ardent human interactions. It's like reading one of those pseudo-English user manuals that come with overseas audio equipment. The reader is left clueless as to which characters/ideas are important and which aren't. Everything is painted with the same brush. Combine that with less substance than can sustain a long novel and tedium sets in very soon. I admit I gave up on the book after 300 pages."
2,Big dissappointment,"I was very much looking forward to this book as I had just reread Fire Upon the Deep for the third time. Unfortunately, this book doesn't live up the galaxy-wide richness and imagination of FUTD -- not even close. The characters are hackneyed and the plot is drawn out beyond my tolerance. The spiders are so anthropomorphic as to be embarrassing.Ho Hum. Wait for the paperback if you have to read this."
2,"Great Concept, POOR WRITING!","This book is not even very good, let alone worthy of being a Hugo winner. The concept of first contact is interesting but there is no actual contact with the aliens until nearly the end. The author does tell ""dual stories"" of the humans and aliens, but it's way too easy to get mixed up because he gives the humans and aliens extremely similar names. Pop Quiz, Who Is the Alien? Sherkaner Underhill or Pham Nuwen? You get the feeling that Asians are the only humans to survive into the far future, because almost all the humans have Asian-sounding names ... except for Anne Reynolt, for some inexplicable reason. And you never learn who the Emergents were, where they came from, or why they are so hostile to the Qeng Ho (who sound like aliens but aren't)."
4,"Great book, not so great Kindle formatting","This book is great but the kindle formatting is pretty bad, there are letters out of alignment, the phrase ""it was"" is rendered as ""tas"" nearly all the time, which brings you out of the action to try and figure out what the text is saying. Disappointing from Amazon."
4,Hugo winner for a reason.,"Took a chance on this because it's a Hugo winner. (I had never read Vinge.) With ""Deepness,"" he creates a plausible, cruel space environment, populated with enigmatic, scheming characters.There's nice speculative science/physics in the book. The story is compelling, and the character grudges/motivations are convincing. A few key shocks and surprises keep this 750+ pager fresh througout. Nice plot turns and character development as well as a couple ""light-bulb"" moments, regarding humanity. But mostly a decent action space-epic. ..."
4,First Vinge Book,"Wanting to expand from Bradbury, Asimov, H.G. Wells, Verne, and Clark, all the old guys that I love, I thought I would try Vinge after reading one of his short stories. I had a tough time staying with it. I was probably a hundred pages in, forcing myself to continue, when I finally got hooked enough to finish it. Given that, I have to say his writing style, dialogue and descriptions, and development of plot are tops. Stay with it, and you will be rewarded."
5,Great Science Fiction,"One of my favorite science fiction books. Fantastic concepts, great story, well written. Part of the (now) trilogy which includes ""A Fire Upon the Deep"", and ""The Children of the Sky""."
3,Make your own decision,"It took me a year to read the hardcover. That'll tell you more about me than the book. Read it, because it does pick up the pace in the last third of the book and you won't know what you're missing if you don't. Up to you. You have to remember that Vinge will make you ""See"" his universe. The detail he provides in A Deepness in the Sky paints the background for the setting and character behavior (obviously). Vinge will make you ""think"" like his characters, too. Get to know Pham, Spiderkind, a world of wonder, the progression of progress and what makes a man bid his time until...Well, read the book. Great author. Good story. Took me a year...make your own decision."
5,An All-Time Greatest-of-all-Time,"This is one of the best SF books I have ever read.It's a ""periodic re-read"" - my own highest classification.I wouldn't know where to start to describe the story.Just read it."
4,Very Informative,I found it a little slow and sometimes hard to keep up with. The book was very interesting once you got into it. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Cleopatra.
2,a very basic presentation with insufficient detail.,"Book has a very basic presentation,and is easy to follow. It was advertized as having 160 pages, but only has 146-including index. It will get you started, but does not even mention statistical procedures such as regression analysis and standard deviation, which are the main strengths and useages of the Quattro Pro Program, as far as I am concerned. Most of what is in the book could easily be gleaned from the ""Help"" menu. Much of the instruction is common to ""Windows 95"" methods, so therefore is redundant. This is the first book I will be returning to Amazon for a refund."
4,Pretty Darn Good!,"Even though this projector is designed for kids (kindof) it's great for families who love to watch a lot of movies. I got it for christmas and I use it all the time! The only problem is that it has to pretty dark in order to see the movie you want to watch. The screen is kindof pixely and medium quality, but it's not like it sucks. It actually looks pretty good if you don't pay attention to the pixels. If you bought this for your kids, I'm sure they'd love it, and I love it a lot!"
1,"""Ultra Comact"" is ""Ultra Unreliable""","This unit does not have the FM radio as is described in the title, even though I told Amazon of this when I returned the units. The Audiovox GMRS762CH is the same as the Audiovox GMRS600SCH but without the FM radio.I have owned both models and they both have had failure rates of 50% (broken transmitters, non functional squelch, out-of-spec frequencies, garbled audio, interoperability problems). The batteries are weak and in cold weather don't last more than a few hours.I'm still incredibly impressed by the size, but it was a waste of money and unfortunately it's too late for me to return them. Save yourself the hassle and find a different product from Motorola or Midland, or go high end with Kenwood or Icom."
1,concerned about the Logo? dont - be concerned about quality.,"I was hesitant to buy this umbrella because i had heard in another review of the logo being large and obtrusive. I went ahead and ordered a black one and i'm happy to say the logo is tiny and unobtrusive. Its on one of the velcro wraps that keep it closed.update:Wow, should have listened to the warnings about the open locking mechanism. Yep, 3rd time I used the umbrella it will no longer stay open. Talk about a POS. This is a design flaw. Oh but it has a lifetime warranty .... yeah if i send them $15 bucks! for that much i can continually buy cheap umbrellas. What a ripoff! Learn from my mistake, DO NOT BUY."
4,good but expensive,large enough for my two kids and myself though. I also bought a 48 inch one for myself. This one is an overkill for one person.
5,Great gust-buster,"This is a BIG umbrella but is perfect! Withstands gusts, as promised. And besides it's intended use it's great to power my kayak while I take a break from paddling on the breezy days! :)"
4,Monster umbrella does the job,"I work in the city, and was using one of those super-tiny fold up umbrellas. Unfortunately, the wind gusting between buildings would ""flip"" it out with even a minor gust. It really made the umbrella a mute point. So, I decided to purchase an umbrella that would last me the rest of my career (or, at least as long as I work in town!)PROS: The gust-proof design certainly lives up to the hype. Even with relatively severe winds, the umbrella doesn't ever ""flip"".CONS: Almost embarrassing to carry around because it is so big.OVERALL: Great umbrella. Definitely does what it is intended to do. Could easily cover a couple, and maybe even a kid to boot."
2,Rubber Handle Smells,"The handle has a strong, unpleasant rubber odor that transfers to your hand. I was hoping it would go away but now the coat closet smells! However, having returned two umbrellas to AMZN already (one arrived broken, one broke the first time I used it) I'm too tired to return it a third time. It's a nice, large, sturdy-looking umbrella - pity about the smell. Puzzled that nobody else commented on this. Maybe I just got a dud..?"
4,"Great umbrella, but...","This really is a great umbrella. Lightweight and durable. Note that this is not an automatic umbrella; opening and closing are manually done.My only complaint is that when the product arrived, a small hole caused by rubbing its own internal frame was found on the umbrella. It is fine as I duct-taped it. However, just slightly disappointed."
3,Fast 26 x 1 Tire,"I had mixed results with this tire. It road great and took the pressure fine (100 +), but I had several flats after no trouble the firstmonth. Perhaps the night time riding on unswept bike lanes was the problem."
4,1950's British comedy that was highly influential,"With a style that bordered somewhat on having no style The Goon Show was broadcast on the radio in Britain and elsewhere from the 1950's onwards, being repeated relentlessly. I mean, I remember listening to reruns on the ABC network in Australia in the early 90's and for all I know they may still be playing it.Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe combine to take their parts in four 1/2 hour episodes spread over two CD's here and this is a particularly strong volume of episodes. Under Two Floorboards is quite fun, The Sinking of the Westminster Pier is also a solid episode and The Yehti is really quite a good example of how the troupe could put together a solid half hour of comedy that was anarchic enough to add to the fun but also linear enough to have a viable plot. The collection ends with The Mysterious Punch-up-the-conker episode which is a fine way to round out this slice of now quite vintage, vintage British comedy."
3,why i hate clowns,"This is one creepy CD. The music is good,however the subject matter is flesh-crawling. A prevert clown is the center of the story. we get a tour of the clown's sick sexual life...wow,thanks Residents!I like their early work better,so far.Now,I have another reason to hate clowns!This is sort of John Wayne Gacy's theme music."
2,"Great Concept, Lame Execution","I'm a great admirer of the Residents' output, and enjoy much of their later work just as much as the early stuff. Also, I've come to appreciate that many of their albums (such as The Big Bubble) require a number of listens before they truly grow on me. Tweedles, however, stands apart in that the more I hear it, the more I dislike it. I think the concept (the sexual vampire) is great, and the alleged backstory behind the album's creation is also a wonderful yarn. Unfortunately the songwriting and production suck. The fact is, the sound is way too glossy and slick; trendy instead of trend-setting. Even the passages of music that sound great are completely undermined by the unimaginative spoken word narrative that scars every song. If the content of the disc could have been as witty and subversive as the cover art, this would have been a classic entry in the Rz catalogue."
5,Gospel Truth...it ain't no lie.,"This CD is a real treat for anyone who wants creativity, honesty, thoughtfulness, originality and inspiration for their daily lives presented in tunes you can walk away singing. If thinking things through and living a right life are dear to you, you'll love this one. If you're not self-righteously judgmental and not afraid to look at yourself this CD can only delight you. Auburn Annie"
4,A car ride with susan werner,"When I recieved The Gospel Truth, I threw it on the front seat of my car and went to pick up a friend. He put the album in the CD player and from the very first song we never said a word until the whole CD had played through. We both thought it was a terrific CD and could not stop talking about it. We played the CD 4 times on that trip, every time we heard a cut we would have different comments on the same song. Each time you listened you heard something you had not heard the time before. The varity of songs in different styles made me a Susan Werner fan and looking forward to her next album. The subject matter was rather intrigeing and unusual which added to it's interest."
3,Gospel Truth,"This is generally a good album but thematically the songs repeat themselves. Nevertheless, the two or three truly original songs are worth the purchase price."
2,Mixed Blessing,"Susan Werner has a beautiful voice and the songs are well done. I enjoyed the album very much but it should be noted that the songs in this album are written from a agnostic perspective, not, as a person might guess, from a religious point of view. I order a copy for myself and my very religious sister but after hearing all the songs, I decided some might offend her."
5,Catholic raves about Gospel Truth,"I am Catholic and struggle with doubt. I find my faith strengthened and my hope renewed by this wonderful music. In Ms. Werner's album we have a necessary voice of criticism holding Christians to a higher standard of faith and practice than the self-righteous might approve of. I am glad there was only one truly negative review, from a Catholic. This Catholic has another point of view: the voice of conscience is heard in musical form. Truly prophetic and inspiring. Thank you, Susan Werner, for your honesty and courage."
5,Definitely check this one out!,"Susan Werner and the Gospel Truth is truly a gem. If you know her work already, then this is a no brainer, get it and you will enjoy it. If you are not familiar with her, then you are in for a treat. Susan is a real piece of work, I saw her at the World Cafe Live when she introduced The Gospel Truth and it was a performance to remember. Don't expect to take this one to your church group, but if you have a sense of humor and appreciate the role of religion in our lives go for it!"
1,Didn't like,"When I bought this Book I thought it was a Western, well it wasn't, turned out to be a Detective book, I tried to get into reading it, but couldn't get into it, was sad that I wasted the money on it."
5,The Ultimate Deception,This book gives one something to think about. We are deceiving ourselves. We may have bought into feel good Faith instead of the real thing.
3,Subjective review of modern Evangelism.,"There are interesting points in this book about modern evangelism. The author makes several good correlations and contrasts between modern efforts and those of the giants of Christian ministry such as Spurgeon and Finney.Unfortunately this work is very subjective and bent towards the author's personal preferences of preaching. Which in this case happens to revolve around the Law or Ten Commandments. The mid section of the book is slightly ""preachy"" but not intolerable.The book offers an interesting if not eye opening review of modern Evangelical's efforts and shortfalls in Evangelising the lost. Although I cannot agree with all of the content, it is a good book to read to maintain balance in one's own theological positions."
5,great game,"I play this with my (very bright) 3rd-grader. It is a fun strategy game, easy to learn but fun for the grown-ups too. It is too hard for my 1st grader.Only two can play, but we have set up mini-tournaments to include more people."
2,Predictable...,"My brother and i had this game for about five years, never wanted to play after the first try, and a few years later we decided to give it a try (again) and we found the solution, we found the biggest possible shape to do and we both ended up tied anytime we played, so i guess it is predictable once you understand the highest score-shape!"
3,"An Amazing Game, but...","Davinci's Challenge is an amazing game. Our family owns many games, and DaVinci's Challenge is the top strategy game. It is fun to play, and will take years to even come close to mastering. My wife considers me the top strategist gamer in the house, yet she beats me half the time.One caveat...the board. The board should have been constructed differently. There are so many small pieces that it is easy to accidentally bump/nudge the board and lose track of where dozens upon dozens of tiny pieces were located.The board should have a plastic base, with tiny grooved edges ala Blokus.Gameplay takes at least 30 minutes."
3,Strong Debut,"And after five years of silence, Rob Dickinson makes a Catherine Wheel album without (sort of) Wheels 2-4. The rest of the CW crew help out on a few songs, but the truth is the entire album sounds very much like a continuation of the last CW album, WISHVILLE. And that's a good thing cuz because that album was a very mature and satisfying effort. So is this one. THE NIGHT is a gorgeous bit of work. Actually, the first three tracks are a heckuva 1-2-3 punch. The album loses some momentum in the middle but then finishes in stride. Not gonna turn any new heads here but for any fan of CW this is a nice addition to the canon. Really, the disc is worth it for THE NIGHT alone. Just beautiful."
5,Michael J Mathes,After Catherine Wheels final cd which was a stinker I didn't know what to expect. Well it's a great cd. The cd starts out great and ends great. Not a bad song on the cd. If you liked Catherine Wheel you will like this disc.
4,Fresh wine for the horses,"I hate admitting this but I am new to Rob Dickinson. Awhile back I discovered a clip on youtube for his song ""The End of the World"" and fell in love with the song. I recently bought his solo album Fresh Wine for the Horses in which the song can be found on. I bought the 2008 version which features six acoustic versions of Catherine Wheel songs (Rob's former band). I will admit there were a couple of songs on the album that I didn't care for because I did not like the melodies but for the most part I really enjoy the album. I love Rob's distinctive vocals.I enjoyed the second disc as much. The songs has made me curious about Catherine Wheel's music which I regret not ever checking out when the band was still around."
2,"Great group, should have more music, better sound","I was upset when I bought the LP reissue on the newer 'Liberty' records under EMI. It was ""an abridged album previously issued under the same title"". I wrote Capitol/EMI a scathing letter then. They gave me some BS about royalties, etc. Bunch of crap. Several other labels reissue without cutting songs off. They did this with Johnny Rivers, Don McLean, etc. One would think they would reissue on CD with all the songs from the original album. NOT. Shame on EMI for this. Bring on the full greatest hits album, not a reissue of an abridged LP version. (For some reason EMI re-released Don McLean's American Pie fully on CD, why not the Classics IV?"
4,Great sample of Dennis Yost Classic voice,Really enjoyed those old classics again from the late sixties. Some of their best songs in a very affordable CD
5,Enthralling Summer Read,This book was a quick and interesting read. The twists and turns won't let you put the book down. I highly recommend this book. I loved it so much that I bought several copies as gifts for family members and teachers!
2,Reads like a first effort,"I don't know that I can cite to one specific problem with this book; but overall it just seemed like a first effort that needs more work. The dialogue at times sounded false; the main character's reactions, comments, actions seemed ridiculous. As I read this, I found myself thinking that someone else (Straka, Jonathon King, plenty of others) would have done a much better job."
4,Built very well,"I purchased this product in order to take 2-3 bikes on camping trips or down to the local trails. It works very well. It's construciton is very sturdy and I have had no problems with the actaul hitch. I did run into a major problem when I sold my Explorer and purchased a Volvo SUV. The hitch does not come out far enough from the SUV to be able to attach it for use. If you have a Volvo SUV, look for another hitch. If not, this one's great."
4,bike hitch,"very fast delivery, exactly what it said, used it a couple of times, has been great so far"
4,Great Rack Espceially for the Money,I am very happy with this rack and I am glad that I went with the hitch type rack. My car is a Honda Accord which has a UHAUL installed receiver hitch which you can barely notice.The rack was very easy to assemble and even easier to use. I have had those trunk mounted racks before which allow for way to much contact between the bike and my cars paint. This rack takes about 5 minutes to hook up to my car. The bike goes onto the rack in about 3 minutes. I would recommend getting a trailer hitch pin that locks instead of the one that just comes with a cotter pin. I hoped this review helped.
4,"So far, so good","We were very impressed with the heavy duty materials used to build the frame. It attached very easily to our Dodge Durango with none of the distance problems mentioned by the KIA owner. It's also nice to be able to open the back hatch without having to remove the bike rack. We've only had it for a month, but so far so good."
2,Beware!,"I purchased this bike rack in January to carry bikes on the back of my travel trailer. I had been used 4 times successfully but the 5th time was not a charm. One of the bolts that the arms pivot up and down on broke as I was driving on the highway. I heard tire chirping and got out to see what the noise was, when I came around the back I saw my bicycle, which was on the outside, hanging down to the road and the back tire had been jumping up and down on the road as I was driving. The other two bikes were ok. One bolt had sheared in half and the other held.If you have this rack or are thinking about buying it, you might think about removing these bolts and replacing them with hardened bolts (which these are not).A bolt remover was unsuccessful. Retapping the threads doesn't look like an option. The option looks like buying a new rack.Thanks for reading, I hop this helps someone."
2,False claim about fitting all vans and SUVs,"The rack itself appears sturdy and well made. I purchased it to fit a 2"" receiver for my KIA Sedona Van. (The info online clearly stated specifically for SUV's and Vans.) After putting it together I attached it to my receiver and it knocks against the bumper. You cannot use the release pin because it is too tight up to the bumper. You would cause damage to the bumper. I am currently looking for an extension for the hitch, hoping it wont add alot of play to the rack when loaded. It is too much hassel to try and send it back."
2,Bike Rack Review,"The rack overall is fine. The way it bolts into the hitch is problematic. Even if it is tightened very securely, it becomes loose after about 20 miles of driving and the rack wobbles seriously, side to side."
3,A little shaky,"I got this rack because I couldn't use my trusty trunk rack on my new wagon. Even after tightening everything that could be tightened (3 bolts)there is a rattle from this rack that is a little disconcerting. I don't expect that the rack will ""fall"" but sometimes the noise makes me want to take it off of the car even when I am using it. Also, one of the straps arrived with a cut about half way through it. Since I'm only ever going to transport two bikes and the box is long gone I will live with this rack, but I don't think I would send any of my friends out to purchase one. There are better racks out there for a little more money, and they are probably worth the extra expense."
5,Allen 3 bike receiver hitch carrier,A very good bike carrier for the money. Is much easier to load bikes on this carrier than the one I had before. Tightens down good to the receiver hitch so there is no loose movement.
4,Good.Smells soft and nice.,"Is soft but really like it.I recommended for day,maybe too light for evenings.BUT GOOD PRODUCT AND GOOD PRICE,i recommend it"
4,Infinite Pleasures...,"A very nice product!! I first purchased this fragrance from a small stand while on a shopping trip in NY, but could not find it in any local stores back home. Thanx Amazon!"
3,The five golden PR rules,"This book laid out the facts about Bush, his administration, and the way the media has played into all of his spin and ""misleading"" facts. This book takes an objective look at the tactics used by the administration spinkled with a few anti-bushisms. If you are looking for an angry anti-bush book this is not for you. Even when presenting infuriating facts about the lies and deciet found in the media and our presidency the authors do not present an angry public anywhere in the book. A book everyone should read if they care about their government and it's use of the media to get their own agendas in place."
1,You really have to love how the authors claim to be nonparti,"Basically these authors lick themselves in their claim to debunk spin but they themselves spin and don't tell a complete story, mainly because of their partisan politics."
4,This is the foundation of the entire Drenai saga.,"While not the best of the Drenai saga novels, it still rises above most fantasy novels. The characters are very human and very real. The problems and flaws they possess endear them to the reader on a personal level. I got chills up my spine when the Thirty was founded. The author writes military fantasy better than anyone. After reading this, as well as the other books in the Drenai saga, I am convinced that Gemmel has lived through a seige on a medieval fortress. Read it, and all of the Drenai saga. You won't be sorry."
1,"Horrible quality, high price, misleading photo image","Hat is made of thin cloth, definitely does NOT stay pointed up as in the photo image.Purse is made of thin cloth, unraveled almost instantly.Beware: Beard is NOT included, despite the photo image showing the beard."
4,Ok,"Its unfortunate that it does not come with a beard and a wig but it still looks nice, better than the picture shows actually."
2,yeah.... no,I am pretty sure it is Gandalf the Gray not Gandalf the Purple. It looks pretty cheesey and not very accurate.
2,What?,"So, I don't own it, but it sure does look like my Grandma's lue Dress. I don't recall the ruffles.... The Fabric should be coarser, and NO ruffles...."
4,I was surprised!,"I hated Christina's first song ""Am to PM"". I thought she would be just another female singer who would disappear after her first single. Boy, was I wrong. Her second single comes out, I am hooked.The song has great beats, cool vocals and awesome music. Christina has a brill voice. This song was huge in the UK! A definite hit, and a definite buy. It's catchy, upbeat and has a positive message, which is always good. Christina Milian will go far (She wrote J.Lo's ""Play"" in 10 minutes!)!"
4,"Rock n' Roll from the 80's: It's not a disease, y'know?","I don't get why people are so down on 80's rock, most of it just great! While there's something to be said for ""serious"" rock, most of it is so down that it can't be anything other than just another elaborate ""pose"", otherwise most 90's alterna-rockers would have ALL shot themselves in the head from the unrelentig self- hate their albums display. In any case, this album, like all the Poison albums, is goofy, great, fun rock. In retrospect I recognize that most of it is cheese, but way- back- when this was the soundtrack to my gloriously misspent youth. The only thing that bothers me when I hear this album is the attending wave of nostalgia that washes through me. Does this mean that I'm getting old, or what? Maybe a Poison reunion tour isn't such a great idea, unless they can come up with an equally goofy, great, fun new album."
2,Almost over boys!,"This CD only gets two stars for the song ""Ride the Wind"" which is my favorite Poison song of all time!! Other than that nothing much to save this CD from the other early '90's hair bands that were going down. BTW, ""Ride the Wind"" is on the Best of.. CD which is much better choice!!"
5,Poison's best album ever!,"This album, which by the way came out in 1990, is the best album Poison has every made together. This is not ""80's"" rock. The boys are showing their musical maturity here and every song is just another example of fantastic songwriting and Bret's vocal ability really shines through. I haven't taken this tape out of my car stereo in so long, I can't even remeber! This album to me proves that there is SO MUCH MORE than lipstick and hairspray to these guys. Should have been an award winner. Buy it and whether you know their older songs or not, you will love this!!!"
5,1990 Poison at the Top. Where They Belong!,Another classic. Man I can talk forever about the greatest band of the 80's. By the way Poison has maintained their popularity in the 90's with 1991 Swallow This Live and 1993 blues based album Native Tongue. Many classics including the emotional Something To Believe In. Worth Getting as always. Poison Rules Forever. Nirvana and Grunge NEVER!
5,This is my favorite Poison album,"This is my favorite Poison album because not only did they include songs that had their ""trademark sound"" from previous albums, they expanded in additional musical directions.""When I hear the music- Let it Play!""I have definitely played this album more than any other in my collection.- Michelle"
3,A little off course,"There is a lot of good material here. Published in 1999, Adams should be congratulated for including modern artists such as the Marsalis brothers, Courtney Pine, and Cassandra Wilson. The inclusion of short discographies entitled ""All that Jazz"" should help anyone to find CD's to listen to. There are some great photographs such as Coleman Hawkins playing alongside Miles Davis, or Chick Web at the drums, and perhaps a few poor choices (Diana Ross as Billy Holiday).There are a few annoyances in this book. The small font, particularly on the timeline is hard to read against the peach color background. Sometimes he tries a little too hard, calling the musicians in each era ""Hip-cats"", or emphasizing sex as a root of the music. I'm not sure Sun Ra, would have viewed himself in a comic or vaudeville light either. I would recommend John Fordham's ""Jazz"" before this book."
5,awsome book,"best writen book ive read pure enjoyment kept me captivated through the end. If you aint got it,get it. Keep them coming mr. Lewis Costley"
5,"My favorite all-time song is ""Island""","I discovered Eddy Raven in about '84-'85 and I recorded him from Nashville Now when Ralph Emery apprised the audience of Eddy's ""footwork"" as he sang ""Letter to You"". Bayou Boys is catchy. I followed him anytime I could and when I heard ""Island."" I couldn't imagine someone giving me such a beautiful perfect song! To my amazement, I discovered a video of Island and I still wanted more! He is different, a great performer, & stands out from the crowd. He is superb! The CD is Great!"
4,easiest music in the world to listen to,"good music, though amazon, you need to get the picture of the cd straight on the promo page...this music could not be anycloser to country, yet you have some tejano dude's picture representing what is supposed to be eddy raven"
3,Good TV set,"Apex 20"" color flat tube color TV, has a nice picture, but i have seen better. has a Panasonic 20"" flat CRT inside. Stereo speakers with 3 sound modes has great sound for speakers of that size. Sony and Phillips sure do better as well as Toshiba. But its a great entry level flat tube TV. has a sharp picture, bright, clear, and good color. If you are looking for a TV for a living room go with Sony but this is a GREAT TV SET for the money."
4,"Best value 20"" Flat screen TV under $200","This flat screen TV has value written all over it. The brand name is relatively new so there is a risk for the long term, but at [$$$] on amazon or [$$$] at [another store], this is a winner. Changing channels using the remote takes 1 second, picture quality not as good as Panasonic or Sony. but for price, you can't beat this value."
4,And what about Roman women?,"My name is Valeria Messalina, Emperor Claudius' wife. I like to read modern studies on women in Classical Antiquity. As Latin is my first language, I find it easy to read Italian books... So I suppose you will understand me if I say that my favourite books are _Passato prossimo_ by Eva Cantarella and _Le sgualdrine impenitenti. Femminilità irregolare in Grecia e a Roma_ by Eleonora Cavallini. Please notice that miss Cavallini tells my _true_ story: I was a very very good girl, not a an _Augusta meretrix_ . Don't believe any malicious gossip about me!_Donne e amore da Saffo ai tragici_ is a nice pamphlet, pleasant and reliable....but I don't care about such a boring, moralist woman as Sappho!"
2,"hey, you are not up-to-date!","_Donne e amore da Saffo ai tragici_ is a dated book. Miss Eleonora Cavallini herself rejected it.I wish I could find Miss Cavallini's _Le sgualdrine impenitenti. Femminilità irregolare in Grecia e a Roma_ (Milano, Bompiani 1999). This is really an up-to-date book about women in classical antiquity. Maybe Cavallini and Cantarella are the only Italian authors who wrote reliable and enjoyable essays about this subject.The title, _Le sgualdrine impenitenti_, is a quotation from Cicero. Miss Cavallini shows how common morality could mark with blame some exceptioinal women, such as Aspasia, Lesbia and Massalina. Very interesting!"
5,shoe goo,very usefull item that saved my old and very rare shoes ( air max plus tn)Shoe goo is really effective when you want to bring back some life to your shoes.I am a collector it was a great help...THX
4,Suprised at the bad reviews,"I was suprised about the bad reviews here, I have always loved these speakers, I listen to them all day at work. I just thought I'd look around at what's out there and came across my speakers reviews.I don't know if the other reviews are from audiophiles, but for COMPUTER SPEAKERS in this price range I would say that you get more than your money's worth. Sure it's no Klipsch, run by some Mackintosh amps, but it's also not something you have to take out a second mortgage for.Bottom line - outstanding value.To rebut the other reviewers, - the base is made of metal and it's heavy, so it doesn't fall over easily, but it is tall and thin, so I guess if you are knocking into it it will fall over.As for the balance, use your computer to adjust the balance. Go to microsoft.com if you need that basic of an instruction on your computer."
2,"Good, but...","First of all sorry if I make any mistake, I'm spanish (the former and the latter are strongly interconnected).Those creative speakers are cute and not too expensive, but:1.- The mid range sounds a bit weak compared to the almost annoying enormous bass(i have levelled it near the minimum in order to achieve a precarious balance).2.- non-lineal volume control(an inconvenient attitude).3.- I have them for eight months and, first barely audible but by now an almost imbearable distortion (without regard to volume) has appeared.I suppose that it's only that I'm not lucky and I bought the faulty ones..."
3,"Not good design, the two small speakers cannot stand stable","One year ago, I bought this speaker at gateway for $80. The sound quality is OK. The two small speakers look not bad also, but they fall from time to time, because the footstand is small and the gravity center is high. I think the Creative Inspire T3000 is much better designed."
4,a great deal for a basic product,I needed this for updating my badly-designed Treo 680 and checked out Circuit City near my home and found that a card and adaptor with identical features cost $60 last weekend. So I promptly purchased it here--and it worked great.
4,good bundle,"This was a nice, neat, and easy to use combo. The plastic packaging could be made a little more user friendly."
5,a great little helper,"I wasn't sure about this product when I purchased it, but am sure glad that I did. I use it frequently to transfer pictures when a card reader is not available. It's a fast connection via USB to my computer. I prefer 1000% over the connection cords for both of my cameras (Kodak & Nikon). It is very easy to use and is an excellent value."
3,Experimental metal from Mr.Takasaki,"The man behind Ji-Zo seems to be Akira Takasaki, the excellent guitarist of Loudness.A total of 5 songs on this CD and all the songs have a slow ""lazy"" feeling combined with monotonic sung parts (however the last song is instrumental).Slow mechanic heavy guitar parts, the result is totally different then Loudness and cannot be compared.At first I was dissapointed but after a few times playing the CD I discovered good songs which are in a way hypnotized.While listening to the CD you will discover the songs [knock] the energy out of your body, the light around you gets darker and everything is O.K for almost 21 minutes.I buyed my copy ... during my holiday in Japan, I saw it only once during my 4 weeks stay there.Up to you if you wanna pay the ... import price for this rare Japanese original metal CD."
5,Petmate Dogloo KD dog House,The dog house arrived on the date it was supposed to. It was very easy to assemble and my dog really likes it.
1,JUNK,Very poorly constructed and absolutely does not accomodate the breeds specified. I have an 80 pound dog and he cannot possibly lay down it in. Total waste of money.
1,Save your money,"what a piece of junk. I had read the reviews and thought there was no way it could be as bad as some people were describing. I was wrong as it was just as bad as everyone had said. I pull the pieces out of the box and noticed some of the parts were already broken. I continued to put it together to see if it would still work and was left with large gaps of light shining through the structure, more broken connecting pieces and my hand got cut while putting it together. I read the company's warranty policy - you can return it however you pay for shipping back to them and they will replace it... so what I can get another piece of junk... no thanks!"
4,Igloo Doghouse,"This item was handled efficiently and was received in good order, except for the cap nuts; four were missing and any attempt to request them thru Amazon was a waste of time. They claim ""others have complained of this and didn't get results in having the cap nuts replaced, so you may return the item and get a full refund"". This is extremely inefficient management on the part of the merchant that Amazon received the item from AND from Amazon. M.G.Roe"
1,"Cheap drive, expensive data","I purchased the Iomega 500 GB external hard drive SilverSeries. It worked fine for nearly 3 months, then it failed.Started clunking and no computer could read it.Sent it to Iomega data recovery and was quoted $2700 toget the files off the drive!! My god, unless there was amap in those files to the lost gold of El Dorado, itwould not be worth that price!Buyer beware!!!...... you get what you pay for... cheapdrive, but very short life. They say I can get a replacementdrive.... right, like I would trust my vacation photoson a drive that might just die at any time."
1,you get what you pay for,"Bought the Iomega 500 Gig external drive even after some pretty poor reviews, thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt as I have had several products from Iomega with no issues, low and behold after four months it just stops.Have lost everything that I backed up to it.Apparently this is a common problem.Pretty poor in my view"
5,Ticket to Fun,"Ticket to Ride is simple to learn and lots of fun to play. The game can be as competitive as you want: people can either concentrate solely on their own objectives or play defensively by purposely getting in other players' ways.This version of Ticket to Ride allows for more strategy than the American map because you can choose between longer and shorter objectives. Also, the map and routes are very well done."
4,Ticket to Ride,"This one has more twists as to how you can get from place to place. Seemed a little harder than the original, but still loads of fun! Our favorite thing to do is play Ticket to Ride in the evenings!!"
5,Great Gift,Bought this for a gift several months ago. My friend loved it since it brought back childhood memories and old friends.
1,Coil not the one advertised,"Coil that came did not have any of the same numbers as shown in picture (numbers in picture were identical to the coil I was replacing, so I went with it). Coil needed to be specific for car...failed after 15 minutes..don't buy online..think they slipped in the cheaper version."
1,boring,I didn't finish watching this documentary it was that boring... for me cant say anything good about it..thought it was going to be a great movie if it had been made into a movie I think it would have been worth watching but not in this form .
5,very emotional,very emotional. i hope these men are caught so these families can have closure. the film making and production itself was done in depth and it really makes you feel for these familes.
4,I really liked the way the author,"I really liked the way the author gives an overview and then discusses in detail all the different aspects of incidents. This book is not really for physicians, but I appreciated the practical aspects of the content and think families that have been affected by an incident would benefit from reading it."
5,Great Stuff,"This is a great product, I've purchased several over the past few years and my turtles continue to stay healthy and grow. This is the largest amount of aquatic turtle food that I have found availible and buying in bulk really helps out the wallet. I recommend the pellet shape as opposed to the sticks, because they can be eaten in one bite. When the turtles eat the sticks, they tend to break them in pieces and that gets their water dirtier much quicker."
1,If you feel like cleaning your tank more,"This food dirtied my tank 3x as fast as other kinds of food. I have two 5 year old Red Eared Sliders and they are very good size, but I think the food is a little too big. They can eat it but half of it ends up at the bottom of the tank. Not only did it make my tank dirty but it made it smell very very very bad after one feeding. It is cheap but I will never buy it again."
1,Pellets too big- turtles bite down and breaks apart,Water gets gross fast- even with 7 inch aquatic turtles. I am going to switch back to the smaller pellet size.
5,Turtles love it - good price - quick delivery!,My adult Red-Eared Sliders eat this food as their daily staple. It arrived quickly in perfect condition and exactly as promised at a very good price. We'll get it again and again.
3,Great Brand - But the Size is Too Big,"I've purchased several sizes of turtle food by Zoo Med, which easily produces the best food for aquatic turtles. The problem with the 5/16 inch pells is that they are entirely too large, it's almost like feeding your turtles dog food.If you have hatchlings or young turtles, the pellets are too large to eat. If they get soggy, red-eared sliders and other small turtles can eat them, but it would make a mess.The 1/8 inch pellets by Zoo Med, however, are perfect for both adults and babies. They're small enough for hatchlings, and the adult turtles don't seem to mind gobbling them up like they were Turtle Dippin' Dots. So while I take away two stars for the size, Zoo Med still makes a great product in general. Just give the 1/8 inch pellets for hatchlings a try, instead."
1,turtles didn't like it,The product arrived quickly. Unfortunately my turtles didn't like it. It just floats around till the filter eventually sucks them up. Back to the Reptomin Baby brand which I would actually see my turtles munching on. I wouldn't recomend this product.
3,Good bench if all the parts were right.,"I bought this bench for the bicep curl and the leg developer. It arrived on time, however, there was a slight issue. The back support beams do not align correctly and almost halted the process of assembly. I had to improvise to get the bench fully assembled. This is no fault of [...] though, I contacted them and they gave the contact info of where they got the bench for( as I was requesting just the back supports; I dont want to return this due to the hassle of returning something this big and heavy). I have not had time to pursue the matter, and I am probably going to let it go, as after improvisation, the bench does what it is supposed to.I do have to say that the bench is a little higher then normal gym benches, so some exercises like concentrations feel a little unnatural. Other than that, it is a good comfortable bench."
5,Marcy M440,Have had ~15 workouts on this bench. I weigh 190lbs and have had over 225lbs (415 total) and have had no issues with the stability. Very sturdy. Also enjoy the ability to switch positions easily/quickly. Seat does not adjust when bench is in incline position. Original description said it did. Can get around it but still not happy with incorrect description.
2,Not what I expected,"This video is nothing like I expected. From the previous reviews I thought it would be enjoyable and relaxing. Shiva Rea goes at a fast pace and is constantly talking, but doesn't do a good job of describing the moves. I would look away from the TV for a second to see if I could do the moves by just listening to her, and then when I looked back I was always on the wrong move. I'm not a stupid person and have done yoga many times. I am shocked by all the great reviews and willing to give this video another shot just because I really wanted to love it."
4,As the spirit moves you,"Shiva Rea is amazing but this DVD is not for regular practice. I use it to spice up my daily practices with the moves she offers, but I wouldn't recommend it to a beginner. For one thing, she rarely offers other levels of moves than the one really complicated one she is doing right now. Also, the good old sun (and moon) salutations are somewhat obscured by additional dancing, which can be confusing. It's as if Isadora Duncan was incorporating yoga into her dance. Not a bad thing, but not really what I want to do everyday."
2,"Too fast, too little of too much","The inside of the DVD cover has a disclaimer saying that due to the amount of video she wanted to put on the DVD and the constraints of space, the yoga is much faster than she would teach in a class. For one, it makes it really difficult to move from one asana to the next, plus you don't stay in them once you get into them. I felt like she spent a lot of time on things that were less essential and I didn't find a really good practice amongst all the options. I bought this DVD for the options, and I have been practicing yoga for 15 years, but, while some of the movements are interesting, I do not like this DVD simply bc I do not feel like there is a straight forward succinct practice on it."
3,not progressive,This video is beautifully shot and compiled. But there is no gradual progress. You need to directly go into the deep bend and twist. It is very easy to hurt yourself if you are not an experienced yogi. It would be wise to start the practice in a warm environment.
5,Nice vinyasa flows,"This DVD is well conceived and allows one to choose a sequencing and make your own class with different elements for warm up, standing poses, arm balances, and closing sequence.I originally bought this DVD to learn new types of sequencing and incorporating them in my classes to add newness.I have yet to practice each one!Thanks Shivae Rea for this great DVD."
2,"a ""unique"" style of ""dance movement"" - that incorporates yoga","Unfortunately this foam roller is not the high quality cast foam roller that you see in the gyms. It looks like it is, on the photo. It is made of tiny little Styrofoam pieces, that all look like they are about to fall apart, and can easily be damaged. It does not look like it will last, without getting lots of 'chips', and 'holes' in in very quickly after a few uses... It is nice and long, and very dense, but the construction lacks any durability. i am very disappointed!! I got black thinking it would be somehow more durable than the blue ones.. Boy am I sorry!! The description does not state it is made of tiny styrofoam pieces, not the ""foam"" rollers you see at the gym. This one will soon have so many divots that it will impede the function! I'm going to make some kind of protective cover in the hopes it will last longer! Live and Learn"
3,It's okay but too advanced for me,"This is an amazing dvd....Shiva Rea is so flexible and can contort her body; but it's too advanced for me. I would have been better off with buying one for beginners. It is a great dvd, tho. The quality is good and the location is in my home state...I would recommend this dvd to people who have experience with Vinyasa Flow Yoga and not novices like myself."
3,Not the best,Beautiful mediatative DVD. Not Shiva's best. I would not reccommend this for anything other than an intermdiate yoga practioner and strictly for a meditative purpose.
2,Very Advanced Yoga,I have been practicing Yoga for 15 years and I consider myself advanced. I was looking for a challenge but this video was HARD. It uses a lot of Yoga vocabulary so I had to constantly watch the TV to know what to do because I couldn't tell just from the audio. I consider myself flexible but not particularly graceful like a dancer and I had a difficult time keeping up with the fast pase. This DVD is not bad but just be aware that it is not for beginner to moderate. I would consider it very advanced and you'd better know your vocab.
3,"like it, don't love it","i really like the free flow almost dance-like style of shiva rea's yoga here. it's very liberating and meditative to move my body as she instructs, so for that, i really enjoy this video, as a stress reliever and to open/loosen my body and mind. i haven't tried that much yet, but from the beginner lessons, i found it to be quite challenging.the only thing i don't care for that much is the setting. i'm a water person, not a desert person, so being in a desert with no sight of any body of water makes me feel a bit claustrophobic. just a personal preference. but it is a beautiful setting in white sand with mountains in the background if you enjoy that. oh, and i'm not a huge fan of the music in the background either, although it seems to go well with the desert setting. It's sort of a very soft, soothing Indian style of music. Again, personal preference. I do think some people might really enjoy these things."
2,Not for the yoga beginner,"I have worked with Shiva Rea's yoga shakthi and Radiant Heart and really like her style of teaching. Not sure though what she was thinking with this one. She flays limbs around wildly with quick flow instructions, a beginner or even intermediate yoga person can easily injure body parts by wiggling in this fashion. It is good to be creative in any exercise form but yoga is meant to introduce stillness and stretching, it is not a dance form. Also teachers like Shiva must introduce level of complexity, meant for beginners, intermediate or advanced yoga, not for all. Clearly this is for advanced, and even there for those who can wiggle body parts without risk of injury."
1,Too weird,"I really like yoga, but this is just a bit too weird for me. The motions and her manner of speaking seem like a skit from SNL."
2,Hopeless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Hopeless!!!The programme which is used to set up the dvd is a disaster.There is no possibility to switch from one track to another.
5,It's the best,"I love, love, love this DVD. I've had it for over a month now and I use it every day. I no longer need any of my other Yoga tapes. I can now create my own practice using this absolutely wonderful matrix system she includes with this DVD. You can pick and choose what you want to do on any particular day with this device. I love the way she incorporates the spiritual aspect of Yoga for the true Yoga is all about the spiritual practice. Shiva Rae has thought of everything you can possibly need for your Yoga practice and motivation. The additional bonus DVD where she includes excellent spiritual encouragement from others on this path was so uplifting. If the combination of the physical and spiritual are important to you--you won't be disappointed with this DVD."
4,Inspirational background and energy,"I love the music, background, and energy of this DVD. I liked how Shiva Rea's movements create a wave of motion throughout the body. This style does not seem the best for stiff people, though. Because of the frequent movements and rotations of the body, it's easy to twist a muscle. I would recommend warming up properly.Though the DVD boosts over 200 minutes of footage, most of the segments involve breathing or dancing around ""free form."" I am not interested in the ""dance"" element of yoga, so I was disappointed. I had expected longer flow segments. (I loved the flow elements but wished there were more.)I don't mean to complain too much. Shiva Rea has such a positive energy, and the water allusions are amazing!"
3,"too ""creative"" for me","A lot of these reviews say that dancers will love this yoga video. Well, the only thing I love more than yoga is dancing, but I found the ""creative movement"" in this DVD to be corny. Maybe I'm being closed-minded, but I'd rather do more yoga and less swinging of the arms and undulating of the pelvis."
3,shiva is tedious,"As much as I love yoga, what I really need is a practical approach. This is not to say that there isn't practicality to Shiva's approach, but how to say? I get REALLY bored when she starts yammering on about a bunch of googly muck. I want to hear about how to move, and how to breathe, and what to avoid tensing, and be reminded to relax what tends to get tense but she really takes it to the nth degree. I meditate when I practice yoga, too, but I find her thoughts obnoxious sometime, and actually my flow of concentration and enjoyment and focus feel very interrupted by her constant out loud meditative thoughts."
3,"It's a voiceover, at least have decent cues!","For many of the segments, you are facing away from the screen for a significant portion of the time. She instructs you to let her voice guide you, but the instructions are generally poor or lacking all together. You'll be swaying your arms back and forth and she'll say something like ""flow through and bend the knee"". Umm, HELLO, I can't see you! How about ""Swing both hands overhead, turn to the left, and come into warrior one"" or something?The other thing I didn't like was the speed for some of the transitions. I have been practicing yoga for quite awhile and while I don't mind a fast-paced flow, you need to give people time to at least get their feet aligned in one pose before moving on the the next. My yoga mat was a crumpled mess within 10 minutes from having to slide my feet around to keep up; not to mention the potential for injury due to lack of alignment."
4,Great interactive dvd moves are a little advanced for beginners,"This is a very good interactive dvd which allows you to custom your workout based on skill level, time, and problem areas. Some of the moves are hard to follow as a beginner but it will challenge you."
4,Not as in love as with her Daily Energy DVD...yet,"I would definitely say this is not a beginning yoga DVD. Yet, it is beautiful and different and very expressive, working in yogic poses creatively. Music is tribal and inspiring of free form. I was ready for a change and I found it in Shiva Rea."
3,"GREAT price, okay toy","I dunno, for some reason this toy doesn't seem too popular. A lot of the places which had it are putting it on clearance. This is by far, THE best price yet! That's actually the main reason I even bought it! I do admit, the vehicle itself is kinda bland compared to the others in the line...at least in terms of looks. I would've preferred it to be a little less flat and less mechanical looking. It's just "" all right"" in terms of looks and display value. For playtime, it's reasonable. It has some neat gimmicks like pinching claws and slamming boulder. The bashin' arm (at least on my piece) doesn't work as well as hoped. The lever always pops out of place and the mechanism then screws up. Eh, but at this price, I can't argue much. If you get it, get it cheap. It's not really that bad a toy in my opinion."
4,Alternate Versions of Familiar Tunes,"Rarities VI continues the tradition of offering some unheard tunes, mostly instrumental, and alternate versions and demos of CD tracks. Most of the versions here are the basic tracks without a lot of added production, but are not acoustic or minimal. The time signatures are largely the same, the tunes are recognizable, they are just different versions. I enjoyed hearing these versions.Admittedly, I am a hardcore Big Country fan, one of the very few unfortunately, so this has colored my enjoyment of this disc. The studio versions to these songs are still my favorites, but this CD is worth it for us hardcore BC fans."
4,splitline membrane trimmer line,Couldn't find this product in the local stores altough I purchased the trimmer at Home Depot. The product was exactly what I was looking for. It is a dual membrane or splitline trimmer line. It came when promised for the price specified. It was still cheaper to get online than buy a spool built for a different trimmer and transfer the line to my trimmer.
5,Swings like monkeys on acid!,"The swing scene is just getting started in the U.S. and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy is leading the way! Every song on the CD is worth dancing to, from the slower, more earthy ""Mr. Pinstripe Suit"" to the light, quick ""Go Daddy-O"" to the pounding drum solos in ""Jumpin' Jack."" I can listen to very few CDs straight through without skipping songs, and BBVD is one of them. I just can't say enough about BBVD, but I recommend it to anyone who loves swing, or just anyone who loves to dance to something with a great beat. BBVD is da shabazz!"
5,"energetic, fun, the way music needs to be","I loved this cd. It is full of energy, a great mix of musical instruments. A time travel back to when people were just glad to be alive and free. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone."
4,Execllent swing music updated for the 90s,"This is swing the way Goodman would've played it if he were playing now. Well, okay, Benny would've gotten a more polished vocalist, but for those of us raised on rock 'n roll, this will do. I've been craving Benny Goodman recorded with modern technology and rhythms, and this is the closest I've seen anyone come. It could benefit from better writing and doing a few updated version of old tunes. Rock fans, don't ignore this! This is lively stuff!"
4,Livin in the shadows,"In recommending this album, there are a couple of things I want to say. Firstly, I am a huge fan of jazz, especially jazz you can dance to, and secondly, they just don't make it like they used to. This recording is awesome for the dance floor and enjoyable to listen to, but it just doesn't quite have the originality and genious of the old style swing, which, in my opinion, was a bit better to dance to. But hey, like I said, anything that can get my feet movin' is part of the club, and while this band isn't necessarily the fountain of originality, it sure knows how to jive!"
5,Big Bad Voodoo Daddy is THE best swing artist in the know!,"You won't find a better swing artist EVER(besides cherry poppin daddys!! All of the great swing songs are on this cd. ""Go Daddy O"", ""King of Swing"", and all the other songs on the cd are awesome!! And of course, let's not forget the legendary ""You and me and a bottle makes 3 tonight(Baby)."" Trust me, get this cd and you will be swinging all night long!!!"
5,Terrific album! The best Swing Band I've heard.,BBVD take the Swing style from the 40s and give it a 90's kind of excitement and energy. Definitely not a CD to listen to just before going to bed! I can't wait for their next CD to come out.
4,Very impressive,Having only just discovered this band i am very impressed. I love this type of music and after listening to this album i can't understand why i have only just come across them and I wish i could have found them earlier!The music is classy and classic but still very modern and you can tell how much these guys love playing this stuff and i can only imagine how much fun their live show must be.PLaying together their sound is whole and well belanced and even when they spread out into different sections as well as improvised solos their musical understanding of each other shines through as the band just blends together
5,SWEET!,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE SWING ALBUM. OF THE 12 SONGS ON IT I LIKE 10 OF THEM (I DONT LIKE SLOW SONG'S). IF YOU LIKE FAST PACED SONG'S, THIS IS FOR YOU! IT IS A MUST BUY."
5,"I listen to them every day, still sound fresh!","Discovered this band this summer and they still excite me, get me moving, and put a smile on my face! The best band I am listening to. They're terrific musicians and Scotty can croon with the best of them. Every track is great. . . I dare you not to get up and dance! My only complaint is, I want MORE! Come on guys, we need a new album."
4,These cats are SMOKIN',"Moving with seeming ease from classics like Minnie the Moocher to the incredibly danceable Mambo Swing this release from BBVD marks a high standard in the swing revival. The singer, horns, strings and percussion meld together to evoke images of both the bright lit bandstand and smoky corners I imagine existed in the swing era dance clubs. Located away from meccas of the swing revival I migrated to BBVD after devouring the Squirrel Nut Zippers collection and Zoot Suit Riot from the Cherry Poppin Daddies. While BBVD can't be compared with either of those groups in a strict sense, the musicality and performing strength of this BBVD recording placed it above all others at the top of my CD play list! Grab you voodoo hats and get a cool kitty on your arm because these Daddies are SMOKIN!"
4,Big Bad Voodoo Daddy is Big Fun,"This album swings from beginning to end. This group just sounds like they're having a great time, and that energy passes off to the listener. They start off with a strong opening with Boogie Bumper. Then they tear through great fast-paced, foot-tapping tunes including Mr. Pinstripe Suit, You & Me..., Go Daddy-O, and one of my personal favorites, Mambo Swing.The album is at its weakest when they slow things down (Maddest Kind of Love is nice, but nothing spectacular). But that rarely happens. Plus they even manage to close the album with the perfect closer, So-Long-Farewell-Goodby.This album is a lot of fun and comes highly recommended."
5,a great band!,This cd is one of the best cd's to get if you like to swing. It has fast songs and some slower tempo songs too. We play their songs all the time at our swing club. Write me if you want info from the area. I loved the band since i heard them and when i saw them in concert i loved them even more! The best part is that there is little diffence from hearing them live and listening to the cd. Definately a keeper!
5,"outstanding, it introduced me to swing in a big way","I had never listen to ""swing"" prior to the BBVD CD, but I am a fan now. Finally something different, music that really gets your attention."
2,Swing for those that don't know what swing is...,"Ok I know I am going to get a lot of hate mail for this one... A. This is not jazz. Jazz is not a pop music, jazz is a art. B. There will only be one Cab Calloway and that is the legendary one. C. Not the tradional swing band. Look at the 1930's (and that was when swing was the pop music) Glenn Miller (whom I don't really like) and Benny Goodmen (ditto) and Duke Ellington(who i love) big bands with 18 or people compared to like 10 that is nothing and not like the swing era at all.And there is no soul in the music... My list goes on and on..."
4,Pretty Good,"This CD is pretty good for old fashioned swing, but several songs are pretty similiar to each other."
5,Swing Is King!,BBVD does the fast growing swing sensation right. Every tracks what you could hope for in a fast paced dance swing crazy time. If you missed BBVD at the Superbowl XXXIII halftime show just get a hold of this CD and don't look back cause swing is king!
4,Makes you wanna swing,Big Bad Voodoo Daddies swing harder than Cherry-poppin daddies. They have alot more raw talent than most band around right now. Most songs are very original with just enough covers. They are keeping true to the Swing music with out boring the listener. And most importantly they make you wanna dance.
4,Where did these guys come from?!,"Wow! If you would like a change in pace from hiphop or rock and want to be transported back in time, check out these guys! This group creates a wonderful mix of New Orleans jazz, swing, and modern story lyrics. I only wish we could have some clubs open up in our downtowns with this sound. This group will make you move and you'll be ""swinging"" before you notice what's happening."
3,Rollicking Big Band or Big Bland?,"Top flight muscicians and at times unquestionably superior arangements, but I left off a couple stars for several reasons. At times the mix of music is a bit too frantic, the singing rather pedestrian, it lacks a certian verve and soul that Big Band requires. Perhpas my tastes were formed in the Mississippi mud, overall I believe this band to be a treasure, but a bit too benign for my tastes. Lets have some sexuality, something from the gut! This is the Pat Boone of Big Band and I like my music a bit more blusy a touch more moving. I want this kind of music to grab me and fling me. I dont want to snap my fingers and tap my toes. I want to , well, SWING!Still and all, this is still a wonderful group and good purchase."
5,Wonderful Music,I love Jazz and Swing. I found this album to be excellent. It was very upbeat and toe-tapping. Big Bad Voodoo Daddy is a new favorite!
4,refreshing diversion from rock and all of the grunge.etc etc,"I first heard a tape of this group that was being played by a radio station in Boston. I was blown away by the excitement and energy of the ""concert"" tape. At this point, all i knew was i liked the music alot, but i didn't know the name of the group......all i had caught were the names of a few tracks.......fortunately, my local music store could easily find it........Big Bad Voodoo Daddy......i had never heard of it. But, i absolutely had to have the CD......................got the Cd the next day, unfortunately, the excitement of the live concert version was lacking. The CD was ok to very good.....couldn't give it a 5 star rating since i was spoiled the night before.look for some live versions in the future, the studio version is worth buying.....this is said by a person who likes the music of the 50""s, 60""s and idolized groups like Cream and other british imports........buy it....you'll love it !"
5,I LOVE THE BIG BAND/SWING,I have always been a fan of the Big Band sound and the jazz of Count Basie and the like. This CD is a combination of both. It is really the Katz Pajamas and really COOL sound.
5,It doesn't get any better than this!,This is a great bunch of music by a great band. A lot of fun to listen to. If you love to dance this music is for you!
2,A major disappointment,"I love the new swing bands but this one doesn't do it for me. The vocals are weak and just don't hold their own against the music. There wasn't a single song that I wanted to listen to a second time, much less over and over (unlike Royal Crown Revue's ""The Contender"" and Brian Setzer Orchestra's ""Dirty Boogie"")."
2,want good swing try the 30's and 40's,This cd sucks what are you people talking about I have tried to listen to this whole cd but have found that the only song that interests me is minnie the moocher which was done better by cab calloway I have an idea for this swing band how bout you go back to playing punk rock it probably sucks too. the only real good swing bands i have heard in the 90's are the cigar store indians and cherry poppin' daddies (who actually play great punk). sorry guys nice try
1,The New Swing,"I'm amazed at the response bands like Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and the Cherry Popping Daddies are getting these days. I don't deny that the music is hooky, easy to dance to, and more upbeat than most. But to call it swing, and to say that it has any musical value is preposterous. This album, and all the others like it are as much swing as Kenny G is bop. Swing was not started as a music to accompany the zoot-suit wearing, swing dancing public. That culture came out of it, and for BBVD to profit from that culture, without giving even a nod to the music is awful. Shame on all of you for supporting them. Bands like the Squirrel Nut Zippers and Andrew Bird are the real people writing new swing music: songs influenced by the music (not the culture) of the 20s, 30s, and 40s combined with a modern flair. This is the true New Swing. Don't believe the hype that BBVD would like you to believe."
5,If I could I would give it Ten stars,"If you want to hear a great swing band whose songs are different from each other then Big Bad Voodoo Daddy is for you. You can Swing to the fast paced ""You, Me and the Bottle Makes Three"", or the Latin Swing song ""Mambo Swing"" or a little Hawian style ""Please Baby"" or even the classic ""Minnie the Moocher"". This Band Rocks and if I could I would give them ten stars."
5,Without a doubt the best CD!!!,"I have listened to many CD's, and Big BAd Voodoo Daddy is without a doubt the best swing I've ever heard in my life. The CD ranges from slow swing to fast swing to just plane out of this world swing. BBVD debuted in the hit movie ""Swingers"" and ever since than have skyrocketed upward. Every day i listen to the CD, it's great!!!"
4,"The Real Swing, Baby!","Nobody does it better than the Voodoo Daddy's. From their early beginnings in Central California clubs to today, these guys put forward 100% and stay true to the music. Don't waste your time on the tongue-in-cheek drivel of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies or the sub-par swing-du-jour of Brian Setzer. The Voodoo daddy's get it, and do it right! Buy this album and SEE THEM LIVE!!!"
2,Take it or Leave it...,"In my opinion, it isn't worth paying for this book--all the same information is available, for free, at wedding websites. I bought a ton of wedding books--and never used them becaue I had all I needed online for free. If you aren't a computer-y person, then go for it...but if you know how to browse websites, save your money for the centerpieces, photography, or other wedding detail."
5,Classy Watch,"I bought this watch before Christmas for myself.First, I would like to say that this watch is gorgeous, super sleek and elegant. I had to get it adjusted because I have a small wrist. As for the other comment about the diamonds being small, yes, they are small but I am not into flashy watches. Granted, I wouldn't mind big diamonds on a watch, but I would be spending big money for that.The price is right though... the watch is well made and the face is a sapphire crystal which makes scratching difficult.I am very satisfied with the watch so far and I already have gotten compliments on it. :)"
2,Very disappointed,"I had to return this watch. The Accutron is one of my favorite brands. They usually make very elegant, impressive diamond watches. But this particullar one was somewhat dull, the diamonds were so tiny that you could not even see any blick at all. Plus they were way smaller in diameter than you would think by looking at the picture. I guess, for a price it was a match but I was hoping to get much more for a steal. Did not work out :)"
5,Excellent Book for nature and wildlife lovers,"This book about the Man -Eating leaopard of Rudraprayag is the best book which I have read for more than 100 times and still I read whenever I want to relax and enjoy the nature which is described so beautifully that you will feel that you are really experiencing the thrills and the beauty and ferociusness of the wildlife,without going to the forest.I believe that Jim corbett is the authority for wildlife and the true and great experience of it."
4,Great stories,"I love Jim Corbett, I don't know if any author is better at transporting you back in time & making you feel like you were there. A warning though, once you start reading a Jim Corbett book you will need to find more of his books they are addicting. Also you will be hard pressed to find stories as exciting. This book wasn't as good as Maneater's of Kumaon. If you haven't read any of his books start with that one."
2,not that good,"Only the left speaker works, and the sound quality is not that good. The speaker has a convenient jack for a headphone, but the sound is scratchy and only 1 phone works."
1,"Repetitive, Uninformative, and Uninspiring","Burnt Bread and Chutney is not an inside look at a culture clash. It's a 250 page whine about growing up with parent who have no money. Dellman is the daughter of an Ashkenazi Jew and an Indian Bene Israel Jew, so she's a minority within a minority group. There have been other autobiographies about similar lives, but this is by far the worst. She doesn't focus on any particular incident in her life that would illustrate her struggle. She just moans on and on about not having what other kids have."
5,"Spicy, Authentic, and Delicious","Delman's ""Burnt Bread and Chutney"" was fascinating, and difficult to put down. My interests in Judaism and the culture of India were both piqued and satisfied in this debut work, and I imagine we will be reading much more by Carmi Delman.The American experience, the feeling of being an outsider, dealing with assimilation and yet never quite fitting in - it's all dealt with in this fictionalized account of a girl's growing up as Indian and Jewish in America and Israel. You can almost taste the food and hear the accents, and you certainly feel her angst; don't pass this by."
1,Dull and Uninspiring,I would not recommend this book - it is trite and uninteresting. I did not learning anything new about the jewish indian experience
2,Unusable with two people on the line,"The phone works fine if you are the only one on the line. If anyone else picks up another line, the other parties can't hear you and you can't hear them."
4,"Inexpensive, Clean, Compact Phone","I purchased this as an extra phone so I could access both phone lines on the second floor of my house. Well-built with hold and 3-way conferencing features, sound quality is good and it has selectable ring levels for each line. Powered from the phone line, no external power is used. One drawback: the line indicator doesn't light when the line is being used by other phones in the house."
3,Good basement phone,"Great price for a two line phone, but I don't recommend it for heavy use areas. Cheaply made, very few features. C-"
4,essential,"When all those other phones (cordless, digital answering machines, etc.) that you use that require a power adapter to run them won't work during an electric power outage... phone lines provide their own power ... this phone is essential if you have two lines and you want to be sure the are available."
5,A Girl Needs A Gun Like A Boy Needs A Girl,"Quite possibly one of my favorite albums ever recorded! Being a dyed in the cloth TKK Fan (I See Good Spirits, et al)as well as a fan of Stax Soul, 60's Garage, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls and Rockabilly to name a few, I can say with certainty that this should have been a classic. One of the few that I can listen to over and over without getting sick of.My oly regret is I wish that they would have had better publicity and really tapped into the Sixties dance, Vampyro Lesbos Trip that was happening when this came out instead of trying to force feed this to the Baby Vamps of Yore. They could have easily assumed their rightful position ahead of White Zombie and Marilyn Manson and conquered the Dance Scene as well.A Great Band, A Great Sound. Cheers!"
3,"""Hit & Run"" is different, but fun.","As stated by others, this is not your typical ""Thrill Kill Kult"" release. There's still doses of sex and drugs, but Satan has left the building and gone to the beach. It's really hard to compare this to anything, but that 50's-campy-surf vibe isn't far off, just with a ""TKK"" edge. Not every track here is a winner, but I'll always keep this for the title track, and ""Glamour Is A Rocky Road"" alone. Both are awesome. The rest is decent, and it ends with a nice little instrumental number, which I never thought I'd say of this band. Overall it's a long way from their dark debut, but it's still the ""Hottest Party In Town""."
1,"Hit and Run the CD, Don't Look Back!","This album is horrible! I have loved TKK Since they became a band and this is a terrible album. No matter how many times you listen to this it never gets any better. If you like TKK's dark side don't buy this, this is pop beach techno, what ever that is? This album is a big mess."
1,WHY???,"I would give it less, but I can't...I grew up with TKK and it's hard techno feel like from 13 Above the Night and Confessions of a Knife...I was VERY disappointed to hear this...Hot Blood Risin was OK but the rest was an utter disappointment...I like TKK for the disko techno acid funk, not beach music!!!"
1,How bad is it?.......,"This record is SO bad... that I didn't even go to see them when they toured it. I am a huge fan of TKK from waaay back, and I've seen them each time they've played NY in the past 10 years. Everything they've done before this record is fantastic, but this marks the beginning of the end. Just really horrible music."
2,Not A Typical TKK Album Was Kinda Dissappointing,"I am a die hard TKK fan and have heard and bought every album they ever made. This album along with a later album they released A Crime For All Seasons were dissappointing. The retro 50s 60s acid lounge trip thing and the lyrics got annoying. The only song I enjoyed was ""Portrait Of The Damned"" only because I liked the lyrics and the beat and found it sexy. The rest of the songs and even the album cover are lame. I dont condemn them for trying something new but they shoulda stuck to their regulra sound cuz I feel they did a better job at it and mastered it. And Satan??I couldnt find nothing about Satan on here, just lyrics that made no sense, minus ""Portrait Of The Damned"". The reason it got 2 stars is cuz I dont hate the band and ""Portrait Of The Damned"" sounded tight."
5,Excellent - Two player game!,"My husband and I enjoy board games and discovered this two player game by Reiner Knizia a while ago. (about 5-6 months). We have played this game a good 30+ times. We thoroughly enjoy it and are constantly finding new strategies, new moves. It is ever so interesting. Ofcourse we have also built our little stories around the powerful 'Gandalf' and the stories of the 'flying nazgul'. So if you are into the LOTR the book,movie ...then you would totally love this game.Highly recommended two player game!!"
3,Expected more,"While I was very happy to see the Deaf Man return, I was disappointed with this book. Frankly, not much happens except the Deaf Man sending a stream of notes to the 87th precint. Unlike Eight Black Horses, there wasn't much action. Not McBain's best effort."
2,A rare disappointment,"I have to disagree with most of the other reviews and say I found Hark! a terrible disappointment. I love the 87th precinct novels and have read almost all of them, and this is the first one I haven't read in a day or less. It dragged dreadfully, the stuff about the Shakesperean notes was just plain dull and unconvincing, and a lot of the chat between the detective read just like the conversations in other 87th precinct books. Has McBain run out of steam, or is it me?"
2,Too Vulgar - Too Much Code - No Cell Phones,"Ed McBain has written many fine novels.This is not one of them.If you are really into code or crossword puzzles or vulgar descriptions of mindless sex, you might like it.The most surprising thing about the book is that none of the characters has a cell phone. It is after 9/11. People have PCs. But one of his main characters has to borrow a land line at his mother's & sister's joint wedding.I don't know what all this says about Mr. McBain's personal experiences. But I wouldn't try to reach him on his cell."
1,Absolutely Awful,"Absolute trash. The plot is senseless. The police detectives are complete dolts, ignoring leads and insulting victims and following no standard police procedure. (Did the detectives really leave the victim's purse, i.d., and handgun sitting untouched in plain view at the crime scene for several days after they found the body??). The villain is a cardboard cutout. The dialogue of the African-American characters is exactly what you would expect to be written by an author who was an elderly suburban white guy. The lead detective needs his pre-teen child to explain the internet to him (mind you the book was written in 2004, so the internet wasn't exactly a novelty).It occurred to me part-way through that the whole plot was inspired by the fact that the author was toodling around on the internet one day and stumbled across an anagram-creator and a Shakespeare quote-finder. Once you know that, you know everything you need about this book."
3,45 Minutes of Imrat's Best,"Imrat Khan is the master of flashy and expressive surbahar alap. It can be said that he treats all ragas the same, but he has no equal in flashy and expressive surbahar technique and it makes for beautiful, gorgeous listening. Frankly, I can't stand sitar gat so I may not be qualified to comment on the last 30 minutes (Imrat picks up the sitar, his son (of all people) joins in on the tabla, I turn it off), but the opening 45-minute solo is pure Imratkhani firework surbahar at its best! Long live unaccompanied alap, say I!"
4,bass from the dead,bought this cd a few months ago and just finally opened the cd to listen in my girlfriends car and all i can say is wow my girlfriend only has i ten and a little 200 watt amp and let me tell you this cd pounds not just a few songs all the songs youll know all the movies that they used for this album like nightmare on elm street friday the 13th chuckie so pick up this album if you are a basshead like me or just want to show off your system
5,The oilskin drover is great,Got this for a gift for my son he loved it great for over his suits and just for wearing around campus to stay dry.
4,a great raincoat,"i bought this as a taincoat, and it serves the purpose perfectly. it's water-resistant, comfortable, and overalll a great coat."
4,Great coat,"My wife loves this coat but not as much as her horse! She says it is hard go beleive how warm it is even at 16F. She was supprised how well the extra small fitted her 5'9"" 150lb frame and allowed room for bulky winter sweaters."
4,"high quality, not my style","The quality of the jacket was great. Heavy, durable material, just like I like. I ordered the size small, but an XS would probably have fit better. In any case, though I thought the coat looked great, it wasn't for me. Maybe it was the cape, I'm not really sure, but I returend it. I would definitely recommend the coat, but order a size down, and be sure that it's your style."
4,Hated the handles in base housing,The handles in our base housing unit had those clear plastic round faucets that get sooo nasty--These will replace them in a jiffy--only negative is when installed one turns forward and the other back--but to avoid water running doun the handle onto sink ledge it is a small thing.
5,The hit of eternity!,"If I were to say that this book were the hit if the month, or even the hit if the year I wouldn't be doing it justice. This book is so much more touching than Scott O'Dell's version. I cried almost all of the way through it. Can you imagine being stranded on an island for twenty years all by yourself? The only company that you have being wild dogs? If you read this book you will discover how it feels. So, if you only read one book in your whole lifetime, READ THIS ONE. It is fantastic."
5,Love is the only Prayer,"This album was purchased on the assumption it was a romantic CD.The music is truely beautiful, but upon listening closly to the lyrics, it is a spiritual CD, and the love songs are about angles and God. The lyrics are among the most beautiful I have ever heard, and although I think the packaging of this CD is very misleading, I am very glad I own it. I listen to it constantly and find it very inspiring."
2,Be careful,"Buy the previsouly released albums instead. While some stuff is intersting on here, the sound is too crude, this being a collection of demos mostly. They have done some really great stuff otherwise."
3,a little disappointed,"The book was advertised as having over 450 fossil specimens in it, but most of the fossils were almost the same in each area. I was expecting a larger variety of fossils."
4,Worth a look,"I saw this on the discount table at a bookstore. What caught my eye was the faux worn cover. Te content is what made me buy it.The book, after a lengthy disclaimer, is a collection of very brief descriptions of various lost skills. Things like shoeing a horse, make a barrel, churn butter, milk a cow, weave a basket, make soap, and the like. But there are a few things added which seem to be done for entertainment value: addressing royalty, read Roman numerals, defend a castle, embalm a body and the like.The descriptions are very, very brief and generalized, and often remind me of the Monty Python skit ""How To Do It"" (Playing a flute: ""You blow through this hole and move your fingers down here."").While I wouldn't suggest this as a reference manual, it does make a good starting point on getting a general idea on what skills a less technologically advanced society needs."
5,Folly and Glory/Larry McMurtry,as advertised and fast delivery - will buy from again - hard to find book to finish series - thank you
3,Not his best,As usual Lmc has abundant characters whose backstory is not always clear. How and why so many English women of nobility hooked up with Indians is puzzling.
4,Gripping but sad,"The final title in McMurtry's Berrybender series - this one evokes the same emotions - a pleasant mixture of humor, horror, sadness and interest in what happens next. It's hardly a masterpiece and I don't think that's what McMurtry was striving for, but it is a worthwhile read. The series should be read in order. Loved the characters of the Berrybender sisters, Lord Berry Bender, the Sin Killer, the fat priest, and Little Onion."
5,A Fitting Conclusion,"A fitting end to a great epic story. Larry McMurtry outdoes himself on the last segment of the Berrybender saga and as usual paints the West with his harsh but realistic brush. Even so, I would like to see what happenned to Tasmin and the rest of the clan but that would mean that the author would have to travel to England, a venue he is not as familiar with. However, I will not sell McMurtry short and if he is of mind, I am sure a fifth in the series could be on the shelves next year. I, for one, am hoping."
2,Glory and Folly,"The final piece of the Berrybender Narratives, starts out strong, picking up where the the last three left off. McMurtry does his usual job of excellent story telling in the first half of the book, and mixes in the bizarre, quite consistent with this series.It then seems as he decides he doesn't have the energy to keep going, and he fast forwards to the end. New characters are introduced, but never inspected; hundreds of miles are covered in a page or 2; and the book wraps up very quickly.In my opinion this was the weakest of the series and a disappointment. Not as many laughs, and a race to the finish."
2,A disappointingly cruel tale,"I want to start out by saying Larry McMurty is one of my favorite writers and that I enjoyed the descriptions of the Berrybender travels across the 1830s West. I don't think anyone sets a western scene as well as he does. But I was put off by the abject cruelty of this final book in that nearly all the characters were either outwardly cruel to others or were buffoons. The child killing scene was totally unnecessary and disturbing, and all the native Americas were shown to be fools, wanton murders, or both."
5,A brilliant heart rendering story.,"Mr. Drake has masterfully composed one of the finest romance stories of the year. The captivating novel will take you on a journey that will capture your soul and captivate your mind. The romance, set amongst the backdrop of one of the most serious and disturbing events in American history, is enticing and touching. Mr. Drake's skill as a novelist is evident as the romantic dialogue of the book is coupled with a wit and humor that is vintage. Don't let this book go unread!"
4,ah!---an intelligent romance novel!,"Silent Bell is a wonderfully written tale of lost love and lost hope and how love can return to renew hope. I loved the way the story played out with the characters---Stuart and Melina---in present day considering meeting for the first time in 25 years, and then reliving through flashbacks their young romance on the campus of Kent State University the year The National Guard shootings happened. While a teriffic romance novel, its intelligent for two reasons: 1)the characters are intelligent with more on their minds than just their love connection, and 2)the story has more on its mind that just love too, with politics and philosophy woven into the background (even Jewish angst!). Quite simply, Silent Bell is real good reading."
2,Camp? I wish.,"At first, I thought this was camp. The allusions to George Noory/Coast to Coast and Scientology made me laugh as did the ""experts"" describing the church and the ""physics"" of time travel. The neo-Nazi like church members and their flying car were the funniest of all.Then, to my horror, I realized that the movie was actually taking itself seriously. Think Ghost Hunters on SyFy. Like a friend of mine likes to say: ""It was like a train wreck after that. I couldn't avert my eyes until the bitter end.""I've seen worse movies available on Amazon Instant Video (Pi), so I'll grade on a curve and give this two stars. (As a 200 level film project, I give it a C.)"
2,Lunopolis,"When I read the description I thought, ""This should be fun."" but honestly, the movie was horrible. The acting was so unbelievable, the camera work was terrible. Yes, I understand it was done on amateurish level, but honestly, even my shaky hand could have done better.This movie is just boring. This doesn't stimulate the mind to think further, doesn't do anything for the imagination and well, just isn't good. I can not recommend it at all."
3,"If You Like PRIMER, You'll Like This","This movie is done in a ""found footage"" style documentary, so it's different from PRIMER in that respect. But the kind of confusing but interesting way the story comes together is very much similar to PRIMER.The movie is one part ""Blair Witch"" and one part conspiracy theory, but in a good way. The mix is just about as perfect as you can get for a low budget film of this type, but it's still very well done. It's not the best movie of its kind, but there are definitely worse ones out there. If you're a fan of all kinds of science fiction, you'll enjoy this if for nothing else it's interesting take on some SciFi kinds of stories."
2,What a mess.,"I gave the movie 2 stars for effort and an interesting plot but in the end it can only be described as a mess with bad acting, dialog, and camera work if you can even call it that. Like ""Cloverdale"", a decent plot was wasted by substituting mock amateur footage for a budget which just results in a sub-standard movie. Even so, it might have been better if the entire movie was done that way because the intercut still-camera interviews of ""experts"" were probably the worst part of the movie and a distraction to the plot."
4,Great Movie,"Watched it just recently and I have to say that the acting and the storyline is pretty good. Almost all the questions that pop into your head is answered at one point or the other. Definitely a good watch, quite interesting and very different to the usual Hollywood Blockbusters. I rate it one less star because it did tend to get lengthy during SOME parts but not by much."
2,Interesting scifi concept,"It did have a twist ending. No great special effects or anything, strictly low budget.It is filmed like a documentary, so if you like that style, you will like this one. Kind of like an X-files story. I rented it, and It's worth watching once."
1,Can we let Blair Witch die now???,"I deplore the ""found footage"" genre ---it's just too juvenile and predictable. From the shaky cameras to the pretentious OMG moments---I watched about 1 min of this one and when I realized it was a no budget found footage I had to let it go."
1,Give It Back!,"I cannot for the life of me see why this movie gets ANY positive reviews! Picked it on a whim..the whole 7 day rental thing should have clued me in I guess. Spoiler....ALL the conspiracy theories explained in one go...or smashed together willy nilly more like, and their ALL true. The 3 of us watching it were almost insane with frustration by the last part of the movie, but we were NOT going to give up at the last 15 minutes. Why sit thru that torture just to wimp out in the last round. At the end, we were all screaming.. ""Give it BAAAAAAAAACK! Gimme my neverending hour and a half back!"" Needless to say, we didnt bother with the rest of the 7 day rental, lol! Seriously, I STRONGLY recommned you spend your money on something worthwhile. This is not it."
4,Excellent!,This low budget movie is an excellent production. If you liked the TV series The X-Files you will love this flick even more.
1,found footage drivel,"The way I see it, amateur filmmakers are going for the ""found footage"" genre to hide their lack of skill at making movies. The problem though is that found footage cannot serve as an excuse for everything. This movie is not some sort of undiscovered gem. It is bad, period."
5,Interesting,"I like this movie , I will call it documentary as what you see supposed to be true , someone uploaded a movie on internet exposing the truth about people moving in time using mysterious stone found on the moon , if you like sort of movies like this then it is for you , I found it quiet interesting , very clever made , it is not typical movie , it is something that will make you think , so if you looking for special cgi effects and popcorn look for something different ."
2,Really?,"This doesn't even qualify as dog doo doo. It does not appear to have even had a script. Do yourself a favor, watch anything else."
1,Watch out! Complete and Utter crap!,"If aliens saw this they would destroy humanity as a lost go from the very start. Complete waste of my time and money. Camera work done by a kindergartner, mumbled(bad) dialog, crappiest CGI ANYWHERE. Complete gibberish, a mish mash of a lot of popular ""conspiracy"" theories, with no plot binding, utter shash!"
2,"OK, I Guess","As a sci-fi buff I'm more interested spectacular scenes that transport me away from today's world. This movie is more of a docu-drama for conspiracy buffs / cult religions. If you don't like it in the first five minutes, turn it off."
2,TV Episode would have been better,I was hoping for an interesting take on the subject with this movie. What I got was the Sci-Fi version of the Blair Witch project. This might have been a fun 30 minute TV episode of Twilight Zone or Outer Limits but not as a full length film. Save your time and watch something else.
5,Great seat of the pants sci-fi docudrama!,"Great, ""Blair Witch raw"" quality. Very good choice of subject. The guys with ties reminded me of the two who rang my doorbell, and left a booklet the other day. Creepy... Kept moving, no boring pauses. Clean and cool! Definite 5 star work. I expect a lot from these people in the future. I HOPE! Keep it coming guys! You just got a big fan! I'll be looking for more of your work starting right after I finish typing. You ROCK!!! Here i go, on my mission to find as much of your fine work as I can get my eager senses on. Again, BRAVO!"
1,Congratuations...,You've found it. The absolutely worst movie of all time.Do you remember the movies you made in 6th grade for arts class with the script you wrote in an afternoon and cinematography shot in a single day? Well it was probably better than Lunopolis.The plot is paper-thin. The dialog is tripe. The acting is so bad that you can't for a minute loose yourself in the movie and forget that you're watching a middle-school production.How on earth did this turd end up on Amazon? The positive reviews have to be shills. There is no other possible explanation.
1,What a great spoof of Scientology!,"This is a tongue in cheek mockumentory of Scientology. The comparisons are laughable and full of humor. Scientology becomes Lunology in the movie, ""looney"" of course meaning crazy. The founder Hilliard is of course H.Ron Hubbard. There are former members of the ""cult"" who escape and warn others. The ending is a twist than only a Scientologist/Lunologist could love."
1,No,"No.By that I mean ""No, this movie is not good."" Or: ""No, this movie is not worth watching."" Or: ""No, this movie is not entertaining.""And: ""No, I didn't watch the whole thing; I only made it to the half-way point. And--yes--getting that far was painful."""
2,Slow,"Started out well, but dropped off in the middle. Good story - but it just failed. Maybe I just did not devote 100% to the movie, but it really did loose me."
3,Better Than I Expected,"except for two extended scenes at different Church of Lunology HQ buildings, during which the acting by the church members is absolutely awful and the personalities of the protagonists inexplicably morph into gun-toting Dirty Harry types, the rest of the film is very watchable. the idea of accessing a secret underground base via a run-down houseboat was intriguing and was filmed well, and the David James character was very well acted."
1,Blair Witch meets Ghost Hunters,"If you took the cast of Ghost Hunters but only gave them $10 to work with, you might get this movie. I was grossly misled by the hyper-positive reviews so I kept watching it hoping that I was missing something. This movie is about time travel - it sucked 45 minutes out of my life in what seemed like an eternity. Once I was able to move again, I hit the fast forward to the last two minutes of the movie and barely escaped with my mind mostly intact."
3,unintemtionally funny movie,"I love when the 'scientist' says, ""Time travel comes down this: either we are standing still and time is moving, or time is standing still, and we are moving. Either way ... .""What? Time standing still and we are moving? Hilarious."
4,Slooooooow,"This low budget, I mean no budget film is not that bad if you give it time to develop, then when you think you might get some action it ends. I just wish I could travel back in time and not watch this movie, but then if I did that I wouldn't have been able to write this review and tell future viewers to just watch the film and don't get too bored there really is a storyline."
4,"Great smell, thick lather.",Expensive but worth it. The vanilla soap smells good and has a thick rich lather. The bar is the size of about two Ivory bars.......
3,Shipment was terrible via Amazon,"I usually buy Mistral soaps from shops.When I received my package from Amazon, these soaps came 'bruised' and the plastic wrapper torn away from being shaken inside its box package.The soap itself was functional, so it was okay.I figured if you're paying $7 a bar, you should have an almost perfect bar, asthetically speaking.I'll buy from these from the shops next time, not here."
2,Almond???,"How disappointed we were at the quality of this soap. It really did not smell of almonds, and its scent, which is really indescribable, overwhelmed the bathroom."
3,Nothing Extra,"I purchased the Wild Blackberry soap. It smells nice, but the scent doesn't last. I didn't see where it cleaned or moisturized any better than the soap you purchase at your local discount store. The soap was fine - nothing extra. I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it a 2nd time, nor would I spend the $$$$$ to purchase it again."
2,Not that great.,The lavender scent is too perfumy. Not like real lavender. I received the melon soap as a gift and found the scent hard to take.
1,not as expected,This soap did not live up to my expectations. First the sandalwood smell is barely there and that was a disappointment and the aroma that is left is not pleasant. The bar is new but still it is losing shape. I would not recommend this product and will not buy more.
1,Junk,"I was looking for a wireless security system, because I thought that it would easier tham running wires. I selected this product and even ordered two additional cameras. I installed all per the directions. I was really excitied when I turned them all on. However, the excitement did not last long. The image on the monitor is fuzzy. There are lines goingup & down the screen all the time. When the monitor switches from camera to camera it is noisy. Cameras came to be weather proof, don't believe it. Amazon is and was no help when I tired to return them. Manufacturer is and was no help when I tired to return them. Do not waste your time and money on these poorly designed units that the manufacturer does not even want back. I am a quality professional and I think that this system needs to be back to the design phase."
4,Nice brief history,"basically a condensed version of madelung's superb work although the author does consult other sources like yaqubi, khalifah ibn khayyat etc as well.Author my guess is of shia origin but his objectivity and assesment of the 2 shaikyhs has to be applaudedSome points though i find hard to understand esp. his defence of uthman ...it is common knowledge that it was his incompetence and nepotism that destroyed the ummah, also the pitiful way in which he was killed was largely because except for a few followers all the people abandoned him ...so zayd b thabit's arrogant boast that all ansar were ready to defend him was a hollow one ...infact ansars allied themselves with the killers of uthman with the exception of a few"
1,Most hideous type of metal ever made,"Dubbed ""grindcore"" by many, Nasum's release is a mess of over distorted guitars and out of beat drumming. It's almost like they all went off and played the fastest, pointless song by themselves and then mixed it together. Terrible"
5,Nasum are the Gods of Grind,"Nasum's Human 2.0 is in dead heat with ""Inhale/Exhale""(Their last CD) and Cephalic Carnage's ""Exploiting Dysfunction"" as the best Grindcore album ever. Nasum set out to do early Napalm death style grind, and they succeded spectacularly. All the songs are worth listening to, and ""Shadows"" is argueably the best Nasum song ever(""Inhale/Exhale"" is an awesome song too.)The longest track is just shy of 3 minutes, and the shortest is about 18 seconds. 25 tracks in 45 minutes, that is a lot of Grind! I highly recommend this to fans of extreme music. If you like this, also check out Warhate, Napalm Death, Yattering, Cryptopsy, Blood Duster, and Brutal Truth."
4,groovy!,this is a cool stoner rock split! my favorite are the tracks by beaver(from holland) get high and buy!
2,Not what I expected,The boots were not what I expected. The pictures made the books look different then they actually were. They were exremely wide and the sizing was off.
4,Jacques Levine Women's 86971 Suede/Shearling Boot Slipper,"The boots were very nice, warm and extremely comfortable but not much on looks. Also, I followed the advice of reviewers before me and ordered a size bigger and they are too big. So I would say they must be true to size."
3,Nice boot if it fits right.,"I did order a 2 sizes up as suggested and that was the correct sizing.However, the boot was just too big and wide for my foot. It was very comfortable and I would have kept it if it was narrower.Really cozy."
2,Shoe size is smaller than average,I also bought a pair of boots for my daughter. They run very small - at least 1 to 1 1/2 sizes too small. I had to return at my expense.
4,perfect boot for a great price,I just received my shearling boots and I thought it wasn't going to fit because it looked a little smaller and it is a perfect fit and I hate to take them off.
3,Not a true size 11. Buy larger size than normal.,"I bought these for my daughter who is six feet tall with a size 11 shoe. It seemed to be of good quality, however the size 11 was way too small for her. She does have Uggs, and she can easily fit into their size 11."
1,RUNS 1 TO 1.5 SIZES TO SMALL,Nice boot but is not even close to size. I ordered a size larger than I wear and still too small. I had to return them.
5,My favorite book,I have been reading fantasy books since grade school. I started with Eddings and in high school found Gemmell. He quickly became my favorite author. I've even gone so far as to order his books from Britain. This book however is by far my favorite of all time. The plot is simple and I guessed where it was going before he showed me but he manages to keep up his reputation of twisting things around enough so you are never totally sure. I fell in love with the characters. They develoed into some of my favorite of all time. This book is a must have for any reader of great fiction.
5,Gemmell weaves a grim yet stunning story. One of my faves!,"""Knights"" was a Gemmell book that left me speechless at the end, which meant I could not give enough praise for it. As usual, Gemmell's heroes are flawed individuals who not only battle the evil in the world, but the evil in themselves as well. The author is a master of manipulating drama, and really puts the charactors through hell before wrapping everything up in a satisfying finale. A wonderful fantasy... one that proves not every book needs a happy ending. (not a spoiler, believe me. Read the book!)"
4,"more good gemmell, not the best","This book is a good example of a story that was almost but not quite fully developed. The feel of the world is solid Gemmel but it lacks a little of the character development you expect. The magic system seemed a little cliched, (colors red,black etc..) and the ending, after much buildup seemed much too rushed considering this book seems to lack a little in length. Still if your a Gemmell fand and need a fix between newer installments read this by all means and if you are looking for a simple and very good fantasy book that isnt part of a multi-part series give this a look, but if you havent read anything else by this author I suggest you start with Waylander or the stones of power series."
2,Where fantasy meets garbage,"I wanted to like this book. I really did. I tried hard. I ignored the uneven pace. I bought into the inexplicable, sudden personality shifts of the characters. I forgave the insipid dialog. I played along with the odd shifts in the story line and pretended they were plot twists. But I can't keep up the illusion any more. This book is simply not good."
5,Expertly Carved.,"This is one of his best books, really moving and clever. The characters come alive and you can almost feel them. Excellent."
4,Hitting Birth Review.,"I first heard Drive On when HFS's Now Hear This was notplaying as much punk.I got the CD and it took me awhile to get used to.There are a variety of vocals and music.I like tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 13 the best.The singer can go from a sad tone to a deep nononsense voice.On track 7, the music goes from reggae togoth ! I really liked the bass.Sometimes I did have trouble understanding the wordssince the singer would scream a lot.It's still a good CD."
2,hellllooooooooo!,"Disappointed with this model -- it's been in use for about a year, during which I've found the speakephone to be fritzy and the handset to struggle to pick up my voice lound and clear unless I'm speaking *directly* into the pickup. But, this model fills a niche for home offices ... basic features without too many other bells and whistles."
1,One of the worst phones we've ever owned!,We've had nothing but ongoing problems with this phone. The biggest one was the phantom interefence noises that would eminate from the phone in the middle of the night! They'd go away if you jiggled the cord enough and then suddenly come back a month or two later. The hands-free option no longer works and now it's extremely difficult both hearing and being heard on it. And we've barely owned it a year!
2,problems with non-AT&T headsets,"I've been very pleased with this phone, with one major exception...the headset capability. Although the phone says it works with ""industry-standard"" 2.5mm headsets, I was unable to find one with sufficient volume. When I called support, I was told that I needed an AT&T brand headset. I've ordered one and am hoping that solves my problem - but I am frustrated at the time and money I've wasted trying other brands in the mean time. Alternatives like Plantronics are NOT compatible with this phone."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"I bought two of these phones for my home office. I thought the menu-driven interface was a nice touch, but it cannot overcome the poor sound quality of the handset. The microphone on the handset is hyper-sensitive. My S's hiss and my P's pop so loudly that it almost hurts, and it's distracting to hear myself breathing while listening to the other person. I'm returning this phone for something better."
3,2 line interference.,"The phone works OK, all features are fine, but when you are using 1 line and someone else uses the other line, you can hear them and they can hear your conversation. I thought that this was something in my house wiring but fond out that this is not the case, (and by the way, I am using 2 different phone companies).Well, if you want something with that price, you expect to have some issues.I would give it 3 star rating."
2,I love AT&T products... but this one disappoints,"The AT&T; 972 has some nice features to talk about (nice button arrangement, easy to access incoming/outgoing calls list, programming speed dials, etc.). The big problem is that it falls seriously short in outgoing voice quality from the handset and/or the speakerphone. The incoming side seems to be fine on the handset and speakerphone, that is, you can hear them just fine. The problem is that people I call say that my voice sounds ""tinny"" or is ""clipping"" (cutting off the high frequencies) when I use the handset. Using the speakerphone, no one could understand me unless I spoke with my mouth right next to the speakerphone. Obviously, this will not work for anyone.So, I would not recommend this phone to anyone that needs to conduct a conversation over a speakerphone. It will not work and you will have wasted your money."
3,Broken Button,"We have four of these phones at our business, but the latest one had an issue where one of the buttons pressed in and snapped below the case - after only two weeks in use. It rendered the phone inoperable.The other three work great."
1,Not worth it,"I had problem with this phoen from the beginning: Headset button not working, speaker now just cuts out. I've only had this phone a little over 1 year. I'd like to save you the agony that I endured by telling you to buy something else."
5,Heavenly Dead Sea Salt,"You emerge from your bath feeling transformed, replenished detoxified...awesome !This Dead Sea Salt is so pure and packed with naturally healing minerals (The Dead Sea is filled with minerals including calcium, iodine, saline, potassium, and bromide),and has a great price ! Thank you !Also, I've used it to make a body polish. Body scrub is made to exfoliate, nourish and hydrate skin.I only added some organic Shea butter, coconut oil, jojoba oil and essential oils. Put everything into a food processor for about 1 minute. This makes a heavenly scrub.The Dead Sea Salt is perfect for kids after mud puddles..Kids Bath - Add one small handful into the bath.Soothes skin, relaxes body muscles, and calms nerves..natural disinfectant too.Cleopatra loved the Dead Sea so much, she ordered that cosmetic factories and resorts be built along its shores.Soak- relax- breathe ! Alexandra"
2,"Perhaps good as applies to Eastern Europe, but nowhere else","I felt that the title of this book was misleading, because though the authors gave a little attention to other regions, they focused mostly on Eastern Europe. International adoptions from Eastern Europe are a very different matter from adoptions from Asia, South/Central America, etc. For families adopting from other regions, a different book would better serve them."
3,"I love Hammer, but this isn't that great","""U Can't Touch This"" is a definite rap classic, but Hammer's success relied more on his pop appeal and exuberance than on his actual skill as a rapper. There are many rappers that were easily better than Hammer even when he was around. Nevertheless, there are a number of good songs here: ""Here Comes the Hammer,"" ""Pray,"" ""She's Soft and Wet,"" etc. The only problem is that there are a lot of bad songs: ""Have You Seen Her"" was a huge hit, but it's not very good. ""Help the Children"" is also pretty terrible. Not suggested for the fans of ""real"" rap (that means all of the Dr. Dre/Snoop Dogg/Eminem fans who don't know what rap is in the first place), but for the fans of the old school, you might as well give it a try. After all, this is the first rap album I bought."
1,"Please hammer, don't ever rap again!","A recording of someone farting into a tape recorder would be better than this. U Can't Touch This, Please!!! time to donate the Hammer tape to Goodwill or the Salvation Army."
2,Just like Vanilla Ice!,Years later I can't for the life of me understand what Iever seen in this! How could somebody actually like thisnow? It still works as a coster though!
1,The worst album in hip hop history.,"Yup, and for a long time it was the best selling in history. What a mockery. The beats on here are barely even beats. I don't know how the describe them they're so wack. The worst afrocentric McDonald's commercials have better production. And Hammer could never rap, his skills are non-existant. He could dance though. But dancing really doesn't translate to a CD, so theres absolutely nothing of value here other than a few cheap laughs in a ""WTF were they thinking"" kinda vein. Hammers just lucky he got to sample Super Freak, and he could dance. That pretty much exaplains the phenomena of Hammer. Only get this for free if it has some kinda weird, nostalgic value to you, other wise leave it in the mark down bin and go find some real Hip Hop."
3,"Erm, ok......","Well the hammer is one of those that you listen to love or hate. To listen to the album would be hard as songs only a few are of interest. Bopping to 'here comes the hammer' and 'yo! sweetness' is never hard but some songs are scary. Very. Do not feel bad to listen and think 'well it is close to a beaver but not as good', it will never! ok so there it is and you now feel."
5,All them hits are good now!!!!,"Play this at a medium volume with the mids turned up to make sure that you experiance the complexity of the symphonic music that backs the furious rappin' onslaught of the great Hammermeister. Whenever I go cruising around Sheboygan, I play this album loud enough so that everyone can hear that I am a real playa, but otherwise I try to use it as a tool for seducing women. Unfortuanatly, none of them have come near my car when I play it. I am so sad because no girly, but this album gives me the strength to carry on."
1,Nothing Has Changed,This album was wack back in the day and it's still wack today. Not surprising. Now go ahead and vote that my review was not helpful.
1,Glad I rent it first.,"This has to be the biggest disappointment ever in the game making history. apparently, people in midway want to get into the 3-D mode...but don't have any original ideas. bloody track the flood? try VF4 with sand and snow...fighting style, VF4 and TK serise. changing style in the middle, try TK. weapons, soulcalibur, and talking about the weapons, you don't have a katana sword with length of a man. also, you don't carry a katana sword like a middle age broadsword which weights like 100 pounds. and the game play, it is still mostly linear, well... at least you can dodge the fire balls now...My advice... rent it first... if you still like it...go ahead... but I wish I had spend my 6 bucks rental on something else..."
5,basically the best,if you know about this game then that tells you alot about it. just think thats its for playstation 2 and its like teken a little.
5,MKDA ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!,"I haven't played any other fighting games in this genre but I can't see any other fighting game better than this. The challenges, levels, and combinations will keep you occupied for a year. The graphics are awesome!!! Very addicting, challenging and fun!!!Sonya, Jax, Kenshi and Cyrax rock...they are my elite team! Drahmin is ""Pigpen"" on steroids..he sucks!!!"
4,This Game Kicks A$$!!!!!,"(I'm going to replace all the ""c""s with ""k""s,just for fun!)Mortal Kombat:D.A. is a really good game and all, but the kontrols are absolutley horrible!!But everything else is fantastik! I've beaten it with every kharacter and i've beaten ""Konquest Mode"".I have also unlokked everything in the krypt.You should definitly buy this game,it's wikkidly bloody and kool! This game should only be played by Teens!!Bekause it's way to violent and bloody for the squirts.sinkerly,kenny"
4,Best MK Game Ever!,"Incredible graphics, many characters, and lots of secrets. This game has so much, it'll take you months to find it all!"
5,Yeah It's different..But still a good fighting game!,"I've read all the reviews about this game being a disapointment My take on these reviews is that the only thing disapointing is the name on the box. Everyone has pre-conception of what Mortal Kombat ""should"" be. Just because it don't fit their standards it's a bad game. If it wasn't called ""Mortal Kombat"" it would get higher reviews. It's different but I like the changes..None of those cheap moves and combos. You actually have to fight and use some skill and strategy. For those of you that knocked it on difficulty. What are you playing if you don't want any challenge? If you are looking for a fun and challenging game this fits the bill pretty well!"
5,Mortal Kombat: DA Review,This is the first Mortal Kombat Fighter game relested only on home systems. It is a blast for any Mortal Kombat fan. The crisp Graphics and intencly deep story line all make for one of the best Mortal Kombats ever.
5,Loads of Fun,I recently purchased this game and have found it to be extremely addictive. Each fighter has its own unique fighting style and cool combination of moves which make the game not only fun but challenging. The higher up you go is the more difficult it gets and the quicker and more accurate your skills need to be. You find yourself not wanting to put down the controls so that you can get to the next level. The practice mode is quite useful in figuring out the combinations that best suit each fighter. Playing with friends is even more exciting. Sometimes when I sleep I find myself dreaming about the game. It is a must have!!
2,How did Mortal Kombat get worse on PS2?????,"For the first time since Mortal Kombat 1 do we find ourselves with one finishing move per character (most of which [stunk] more than a weekend with richard simmons). They tried to make a three stance fighting system work with MK and failed, the addition of weapons might have impressed some people but all in all was a let down. Further more the lacking of background fatalities was another let down. The only redeeming factor for this latest installment was the graphics were pretty nice, and the crypt feature was a little cool at first. But all in all you'd be better off if you skipped this one."
5,asume,It was very fun and exiting and I could understand it very clearly. It had a lot of action and awarness.
4,A really great game,"I thought this was a really great game. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that Liu Kang is dead, and the krypt. I mean the krypt has hidden characters, but getting sketches? There's no use. There are 676 coffins, and only about 9 hidden characters. Other than these 2 problems,this is a game that will fill the hunger for the MK crave."
5,Best Fighter Ever!!!,"This is THE BEST fighting game I have ever played. It sports awsome graphics, some of the best I have ever seen. there is also an extreme amount of blood, which makes the game all the more realistic. It has a huge amount of replayibility, giving you more bang for the buck. It can easily keep you interrested for hours on end. You earn Koins by winning battles and by training. With these Koins, you can purchase different things, such as alternate costumes, new characters, or old photos of the game in its early stages. You can also play with a friend and you can bet Koins, allowing for an excellent amount of friendly competition. Overall this game is an A+ title, and it is worth what you pay for it."
4,RIDICULOUSLY GORRY!,"The graphics on this game are good. The combinations are difficult to execute. The fatalities are a little lame, not as good as previous ones. Excessive use of blood and guts for each contact. They do have a feature where you can minimize the amount of gore, but their lowest level (just above completely turning off the gore) is still over done. But overall a pretty good game."
3,Not bad,Not bad in graphics. 3 different fighting styles but don't have many moves. Not dynamic like the old mortal kombat games.
4,Another example of the Chairman's brilliance,"While no individual CD can come even remotely close to covering Sinatra's career, or even his stint with a specific label for that matter, if you are looking for one solid CD by Frank Sinatra, this would be a good one. Though most of the arrangements here are by Nelson Riddle, the best arrangement on this album is by the amazing Billy May with his orchestration of ""South of the Border."" Also, there are some amazing slow ballads in here including ""From Here to Eternity,"" ""Don't worry 'Bout Me,"" and ""Melody of Love"" which was orchestrated by Ray Anthony. Throw in other Sinatra standards such as ""Chicago"" and ""High Hopes"" and you have an excellent collection, although, once again, far from a complete one."
4,FRANK's TEETH,"Okay baby,the cover photo was embellished by a computer,and yesterday you told me you wanted at least a sample of SINATRA's CAPITOL singles because the complete singles collection is too expensive.I have found it for you,this is it.You have signatures songs:I'VE GOT THE WORLD ON A STRING,SOUTH OF THE BORDER,HIGH HOPES;you have singles not available on albums:HEY JEALOUS LOVER,MELODY OF LOVE,DON'T WORRY'BOUT ME;you have a few chat before a few songs;you have excellent liner notes.Now since you are satisfied in every way,can we make love peacefully?Did i tell you that my girlfriend's name was KAY?Now you know."
2,Chairman of the BORED,"If you're into watching paint dry as a hobby, this is the album for you. The only saving grace on this outing is the Nelson Riddle orchestra. I found this album with very few exceptions bland to say the least. And what's with the engineer announcing the takes on 3 of these songs? Should we care? Capital did the same thing on the Nat Cole collection disc. Go get yourself the Tony Bennett 'Ultimate' collection if you want to hear crooning with heart."
5,Real U. S. Steel.,"I purchased a front bearing from a local national auto parts chain. The part appeared to be the same as the one being replaced however upon closer inspection I discovered it was made in China and the bearing had no markings on it. This A C Delco bearing assembly contains a clearly marked ""Timken"" bearing made in the U. S. and should last as long as the original.I have been running this wheel bearing on my 4X4 for several months and it has performed to my complete satisfaction. I highly recommend staying with Delco when and where possible."
5,Banished,"THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL FILM OR DOCUMENTARY, IT DEFINETELY IS AN EYE OPENER. IT CAN BE WATCHED WITH THE FAMILY"
4,Great voice,"Alejandro Fernandez certainly has his father's genes. Powerful and melodious voice, a very good choice for his fans. You will be playing this CD again and again. He is one of the best Latin American singers."
5,A Corazon Abierto,"WOW! This is a beautiful voice. Didn't know about him until recently, but he's got a brand new fan. Love the songs - love everything about this album."
4,His best direction.,"Alejandro has an amazing and versatile carreer singing two types of music. Rancheras and pop. Personally I don't like rancheras but I have to admit that he sings them very good because of how he delivers the songs and because of his voice.""A CORAZON ABIERTO"" (With open heart) is a purely pop album loaded with very good songs including ""ME DEDIQUE A PERDERTE"" which was the first single and had a very big success in a America and Spain. You can find that track in pop and salsa versions. Other great songs on this album are the heartfelt ""QUE VOY A HACER CON MI AMOR"", ""QUE LASTIMA"" and most chilled up ""CANTA CORAZON"".The album was produced by Kike Santander who happends to be one of the best producers in the Latin Market and besides being the procer, he also wrote several songs for the album.You should give it a try and listen this cd because is very good."
2,Alejandro Fernandez - A Corazon Abierto,"This album left me wondering. . . Why did i buy it? I feel he has recorded better material before. seems like he was forced to record another Ballad Album since quite honetly his last Ranchero albums havent really sold that well. if you want great music try listening to Pepe Aguilar's new album ""No soy de Nadie"" Now that is talent!"
5,the best yet,"no one has a better voice to sing these types of ballads than alejandro. i know he's famous for and loves his homeland mariachi-type music, but ballads are where the depth and range of his voice are shown off. every single one of these songs will put you in such a mood! i really can't say one is a favorite because they're all excellent. when a mellow, relaxing and/or romantic mood is what you're after, you could listen to this CD all day long. i could. i've never heard anyone else sing whose voice alone touched me so much that i wished i could meet them. i'd love to know the person who belongs to this voice!"
3,'twas ever thus,"Lupine howling?At a time when MPs pad their expenses and serious questions about the role of NATO remain unresolved?Political correctness gone mad, surely?Sadly, 'twas ever thus I suspect."
3,this shirt & some parachute pants,"i don't own this but one look and i know i could quit my job and start drinking full time. i need some good pants tho' maybe some of those pants, people who looked at this item also looked at these items. i could be the biggest loser without going on tv. i want one but don't make me put it on."
1,Four Cats Lightning Is Better.,"I have the Four Cats Lightning Tee Shirt and have been asked on more dates than when I was wearing The Three Wolves Tee. Most of the women told me they were tired of the guys wearing Three Wolves Tees - it's just like fashion folks. The Three Wolves Tee had a good run but it's on to the next thing.The Four Cats Lightning Tee is washed with real feline urine to ensure the smell is permanent. The urine smell makes the women go crazy. The cats depicted on the shirt are wild stray cats. One is a tabbby, another siamese, and the other two must be their offspring because they are a mix. Did I mention how much more putang I get?"
5,Received Life!!!,"I used this shirt to catch my daughter when she was born out the bed of our truck. There were no doctors and my wife had gone into labor when we were fishin. I panicked and took my shirt off to help with the baby. When the baby was born I used my knife to cut the umbilical cord. Me and my wife both cried at the sight of the baby being held in my shirt. When I had passed her to my wife, I looked out into the distant woods and saw three wolves standing on the other side of the lake with the reflection of the full moon in the water beneath them. I cried more, to this day I haven't washed the shirt but it always smells fresh. It was magical beyond comprehension."
5,Alpha male at the mall.,"My younger brother believed in the shirt so much be bought me it for Christmas. I was well aware of the awesome power that it had but was skeptical that it could help a shy, ginger kid like myself. Upon putting it on I was immediately enveloped by the smoke of the shirt. This being the holiday season and all I knew going to the mall was going to be a trying experience with the crowds and such. Once entering the mall I preceeded to go to several stores hoping a hot chick would see me and try to hook up with me. But the opposite happened not one person spoke to me. It was so weird that all those people and not one salesperson asked me if I needed help. What I finally figured out was that they saw the three wolves and realized that I was the alpha male of the mall which made them be very intimidated. So I say to all those shy kids who need a little confidence go get the shirt and try it for yourself."
1,Don't believe the hype.,I purchased this shirt after reading all these reviews and sadly it does not posses a single power mentioned in any of them. I feel as though I have been tricked into buying this and want a refund.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I have it on good information that this is all just a viral campaign to sell this shirt. The same company is coming out with a four wolf shirt in a month and they need to burn through this soon to be worthless stock. Seriously, if you really feel the pack, wait a bit, you will not be disappointed."
3,Love the Shirts here BUT...,"But! WTF!! All i see is wolves on here?! good lord.. there are so many other animals you can make shirts on, is there any way I can make a shirt by giving you an animal? cause out of the 1500 and a few more shirts you have 1k wolves there abouts.. very pretty, BUT ugh... talk about target marketing.. oyi."
1,Made in China,"It's a nice shirt if you have no originality. If you're a frat boy with self esteem issues, this is the one. Stop sending me advertisements."
1,JUST ANOTHER SCAM... BUT VERY CHEAP,"I just have one advise for people thinking of buying this T-shirt for its majic powers: Run for your life!I am a true believer of the invisible powers in the universe; however, this T-shirt didn't have the power to give me my money back from so many crooks and opportunistics that I had met recently.The only thing I noticed is that when I went back to court - this time with my three-wolves T-shirt, some crooks were losing their cases. I guess this happened because of my T-shirt.The botton line is that it all depends on each individual and his/her faith.Eventhough, I am a true believer of the invisible powers, this time I am very skeptical."
4,Hair of the Wolf,"As the quality fabric of very good value cotton T-shirt touched my well cared for skin, I too noticed an instant transformation. I began to hear things impossibly far away and smell the faintest aromas from popular fast food outlets. With slavering intent, enhanced by the mysterious screen printed lupine artistry; I bounded towards my deep fried quarry with hairy grace, past admiring females, eager for a chance to admire the clarity of the printed washing instructions on the label. With canine dexterity I spilled crimson globs of ketchup on the washable color fast masterpiece. Hoooowwwl could anyone not want to bite, I mean buy this amazing tribute to all that is sacred and poetic? I wish I had two. I wish I was back in 1978."
5,Get Up On This...,"I cannot wait to get this shirt in the mail!I am an average looking gay dude who likes to ""take the dirty road home"" if you know what I mean. And the shirt screams GET UP ON THIS!I think, once I get my T Shirt, Operation Slut 2013 is an order. I am going to turn my duplex from a house to a hot dog cart when I sport this shirt.Bark at the Moon? I think not. Howl at the moon is more like it."
4,Threat to seal acts,"I didn't know a wolf could balance a ball on its nose. No wonder wolves howl at the moon, the one ball they can't reach. I'm waiting for the shirt with wolves biting rows of bicycle horns to play a recognizable tune. I've never seen wolves clap their front paws together, so they're really not a threat to stage seals."
5,Unleash your inner wolf,"We recently bought this wolf shirt for my brother-in-law as a birthday present. I think the term `blown-away' can be over-used but it is an under statement in this case. He told us he had a trip coming up and the wolf shirt would figure prominently in his vacation attire plans. The real challenge, he told us, would be to find just the right time to unleash the power of the wolves on his friends to maximize the impact. It's too early to say but I would not be surprised if the wolf shirt changes his life in some significant ways.Pros: Supremacy, mystery and allusiveness of wolves on a black shirt.Cons: No wolves on the back."
4,Amazing shirt but be warned,"Love d shirt. Problem is , bout a week after I first started wearing it, my damn trailer has been broken into every time I go to the store for smokes and a 6er of Bush. Now it must always be on me back side or tucked in me tighty whiteys like 2 ticks on a hound dog least some fool try to steel me wolve t. I mean gawd dang get ya'lls own."
2,not the intended effect,"I bought this shirt to go along with my ironic mesh cap, and the name-on-breast mechanics jacket I bought at the consignment shop (worth every penny of that [...]). I figured it'd be just the thing to consolidate my faux trailer trash look and attract all the hot pierced hipster ladies.However, apparently I've gone too far, people no longer realize I'm trying to ironically make fun of poor white people, they think I AM trailer trash. The hot indie girls don't come up and talk to me at the bar, they just point and snicker.Maybe I should cut my mullet? Or add a septum piercing?"
1,Bummer,I put this away with my other T-shirts and before you know it it had devoured my Three Sheep T-Shirt.
4,I Am Female,"I am an attractive woman by beer-goggled standards. But because of my course mustache**, prominent mons pubis, and ample back fat, I don't often get approached by men (even when I premiered this shirt on a Friday night at the Denny's bar). After several unsuccessful weekends, I got wise to the ways of the manhunt. I Bedazzled the words ""I AM FEMALE"" on the back. You can't deny the allure of three wolves on the front and the unequivocally feminine rhinestone-studded message on back.I would have given this shirt five stars but am resentful over the $24 I had to pony up for the studding apparatus.**(No; I don't mean a Tuscan Whole Milk mustache. I'm growing the real deal)."
1,May have side effects,The effect that this t-shirt has on women is pretty impressive. Unfortunately its natural healing powers reversed my vasectomy and I impregnated nine women in two weeks before I realized. They all had twin boys. Now I have 18 sons and spend most of my money on child support and condoms.
5,"Look out Starbucks, here I come!!!!","At this years office Holiday party, the Three Wolf Moon T-shirt was one of the gifts. I had to fight people off with my green stick to keep it. I can't wait to wear it to Starbucks!!! Thank you Three Wolf Moon T-shirt, you truly are magic!!!!-- Bachar"
5,Artist reveals background about the wolves!,"According to the artist, the design of this shirt is named ""Majestic Wolf And His Family"", and the wolves all have names: ""The oldest ones name is ""Chancellor"". There's a good chance he's half domesticated. The second is ""Galko"", which is Hebrew for 'kindness'. The pup is unnamed. You can't put a name on the innocence of that face, can you?"""
2,DO NOT WASH!!,"After years of this shirt being on my Amazon wish list, my family finally got it for me for Christmas. The first thing I did, as I do with all new clothes, was wash it. HUGE mistake. This shirt does not like water, apparently, and now I have to rebuild my kitchen and laundry room."
4,The three wolf Moon Shirt saved my life.,"The other day a Meteor hit my families boat, and I was thrown into the ocean. Luckaly I had on my 3 wolf moon shirt, and the ancient indian god of water called down to me and told me what to do. I took off the wet shirt, filled with with air and used it as an inflatable raft. From there I rode it down the gulf stream and landed somewhere in southern Jersey. The shirt did not rip or stretch, and when I took it out of the water, it deflated and dried off on its own. This shirt is amazing!"
1,Lupine Exploitation!,"Don't buy this shirt! I have it on good authority that the Wolves have received no royalties from the ever-growing sales. No wonder they are howling. Wolves, say hello to the Slumdog Millionaire kids."
1,Foiled Plan,"After I heard that Chuck Norris could be stopped by someone wearing the Three Wolf Moon shirt, I immediately bought one specifically to find him and, while wearing this shirt, defeat Chuck Norris. Upon wearing this shirt, it instantly guided me to Chuck Norris' location. On my way to visit him, I was followed by a horde of beautiful women. Once I found him and as I was about to destroy him, I saw that he, too, was wearing the Three Wolf Moon shirt, and was awaiting my arrival. Chuck Norris' powers have increased exponentially upon wearing of the shirt, and quickly disemboweled me. Luckily, due to the Three Wolf Moon's natural healing properties, I escaped certain death and fled. Unfortunately, the swarm of women did not follow me back, but instead had their way with Chuck Norris."
1,THis shirt has ruined my life.,"After getting this shirt... I was approached my so many women that I had to install a ""take a number"" dispenser on the crotch of my jeans. I have released so much of my seed into this world because of this shirt, I now suffer from a permanently low sperm count. I can no longer father children.THANKS for nothin 3 wolf moon t-shirt."
1,Bigtime gyp,"I was told by the seller that the moon was painted with disappearing paint that faded in sunlight and that during the day the moon would disappear and the shirt would be transparent there, thereby giving off the awesome effect that the wolves would be howling at my bare peck and nipple.Needless to say, it was a lie. Neither were the wolves made of squishy material so they didn't even squeak/howl when I pushed on them.Double gyp.Also, they said the the shirt would be slimming on my robust frame, but instead it made the bottom wolf look like it had an enormous neck.Not really a gyp on the last one... but it just looked weird.What might be cool is two wolves mating while the male wolf howls at the moon. I'd buy that."
3,TWO WOLF MOON TSHIRT,"WOW! That's how I describe my reaction on viewing this product - but, then I saw the price! WHOAH! $16.75!? What am I a doctor (NO), a lawyer (NO), Vin Diesel? HA, in my dreams!I'm writing this review to ask The Mountain Men to produce a tshirt for the COMMON MAN. I'm not asking for a price reduction. How about, a two wolf moon shirt???"
4,Shamwow with Wolves,"I liked the design of this Tshirt so much that I ordered two of them. Then the idea came to me that I could use them as seat covers in my Camaro because I'm all about classing up my ride. I stretched the Wolf shirts over the backs of my Camaro seats and it's now the hottest car in the entire trailer park. Unfortunately my T-tops started leaking the other day, and before I could fix them up with some duct tape the Wolf shirts got a little wet. But the Wolf shirts lapped up the water like a ShamWow. A ShamWow with bitchin' wolves on it. Not much hope for the Kraco 8 track player, though. Maybe if the tape player had wolves on it, it would still work too. Long live the Wolf T-shirt."
1,Not for Children,"Although this shirt comes in children sizes it is not intended for them. Children just don't have the mind power to control the mystical powers of this shirt. Myself and my 5 kids wore our 3W&M shirts to a family reunion and after a three legged race did not go Jr's way mayhem erupted. All I can say is that by the time animal control was called a better half of my family was gone and Hut 42 looked like a catchup factory had exploded on it. Nana still isn't talking to me, and pop pop seems to be holding a grudge about his missing leg. On the plus side the shirts arrived on time and blood washes right out of them."
5,I love this shirt!!,"This gal loves wolves! I have a print hanging over my queen size waterbed that looks very similar to the picture on this shirt. I bought four of these shirts to craft into thrown pillows for my bed. They look so good. Every dudeI invite into my boudior has mentioned how rad the wolf theme is. My room is decked out in sexy wolf hotness. If I get serious enough with a stud to keep him around during daytime hours, I'd totally give him this shirt. He'd be rocking the shirt and I'll be all ""stop looking at my man"" to my roommate Kathy. Kathy thinks she was into wolf art before me. She didn't even own any before she moved into my trailer."
1,Diserpoined to sey tha lease.,"I don't read so well, so I reck'n thems were panthers. Not panthers! Not happy!"
5,"Awesome, but.....","Shirt is awesome! However, Kevin Costner keeps following me around wanting to slow dance. Perhaps 3 wolves is too much."
5,What's More Than More?,"I'll tell you what is more than more...this shirt is. I had a 3 cat shirt and a 3 ferret shirt (not the stupid one with the comet, but the one with the sparkly planets), but somehow, someway, people got the wrong idea. Those shirts didn't fully capture my essence. I'm not a softie...I'm a man. A hard-charging, decisive, take no prisoners man. I thought those other shirts were good, by golly, but this shirt is just...more than great. It's me. And I'm a somebody. A wolf-man if you will. Buy this shirt and prepare to have your world rocked."
5,This shirt just got me pregnant,"After years of infertility, I find myself now pregnant - oddly occurring coincidental with the time right around when my husband received this shirt. I believe it's the intense power of this shirt that made me become so."
5,Who needs guns when you have a wolf shirt!,"It is not easy to find a shirt with not one, not two, but three wolves on it. I consider myself truly fortunate to have found this. This wolf shirt has served as protection for me time and time again.Once, an intruder broke into my house. Though normally I would have feared for my life, I suddenly remembered the wolves and all if my fear left me. The intruder saw that they were out numbered (four to one), so he ran and I was left unharmed!Everywhere I go, people think twice about bothering me because they see my wolf protection.I believe that if everyone in our country would wear this shirt, we would not need assault weapons. This shirt would deflect harm and dissuade bad people, but this shirt would not harm innocent children! The true solution for this country is to ensure that all people, especially the children, have this protective wolf shirt."
5,Transformational Powers of Amazement!,"So I had my doubts. After reading every one of these reviews, I decided it would be worth the $$$ to at least try...So when I got my Three Wolf Shirt and I saw those bad boys howlin away like that, I threw on my new shirt and POW! My inner Mick Jagger was released! I coupled my new article with my trustiest pair of butt-shrinking Levi's and I took to the streets.Maybe it was the swagger in my stride, maybe it was the 'call of the wild' shining through my eyes, maybe it was... nah, it was the shirt. I had women crashing their cars as they drove past just to get my attention. I walked down a busy sidewalk and the crowds parted like the waters did for Moses.I don't know if I'll ever find another shirt like it. Ever. Thats why I bought 2.Boo-ya."
4,Realistic: too realistic,"I loved the shirt but, unfortunately, I had to return it. I'm allergic to dogs and the depiction of canis lupus on the shirt is so realistic that I broke out into hives when I wore it. IT'S TRUE! There was also some weird tidal effect going on with my blood and other body fluids; maybe it was the moon. So, if you don't have allergies to the canine family or if you can afford a lifetime supply of Benadryl (I can't), this is one sweet, realistic shirt."
4,Do not believe Amazon,"First of all, the description says the shirt is made of cotton, but this isn't any cotton that I've ever felt. If I have to describe it, I'd say its made of Jessica Alba's hair. Normally, a hair shirt would be quite uncomfortable, but when Jessica Alba sells her hair to make you a shirt, you just wear it.As for the shirt's purported powers, I have found that it has not dramatically enhanced my attractiveness. While there is a great deal of pointing whenever I put it on, this is not limited to just women. So for those of you who are suddenly finding women throwing themselves at you when you wear this shirt, know this: the power doesn't come from the shirt -- the power comes from you. It always has."
4,Triple XXX Threat!!!,"I'm currently scrubbing the cum off of my new wolf shirt. When I opened the package and glanced at the front of the shirt I couldn't help myself.The artist that designed this wonderful shirt did an amazing job, but there are a few items missing that would make this shirt a 5-star item.1) Indian person (feather, not dot)2) Dreamcatcher - also sweet3) Lightning - enough said4) Wolves on back of shirtIf someone can pull this off, I will be the first to purchase it."
5,t-shirts don't get any better,"i like this t-shirt because it has 3 wolves on it. 3 wolves is much better than 1 wolves and also better than two wolves. 4 wolves would be two much. 3 budgies would be rubbish!!! 3 dragons would probably be better than 3 wolves but they probably couldn't fit 3 dragons on 1 t-shirt. the planet mars might be better than the moon, but 3 wolves are unlikely to howl at mars because it's too small.i'm on meds."
5,Thanks 3 Wolf Moon,I bought my boyfriend this tee shirt for his birthday. Once he had it on I became pregnant. We've never had sex. Thanks 3 wolf moon.
1,PLEASE! Three wolf moon t-shirt???,"Who would buy this piece of trash?Because, if you hadn't already noticed, it now comes in SLEEVELESS format.Sleeves are for wimps.Please, do yourself a favor and grow a pair and surf on over to the sleeveless offering now.Because in order to do TRUE collatoral damage, you must have the guns exposed.KAPOW!"
3,Shirt Colors!,"I love this shirt. However, my husband wants them in light-brown/Khaki color so he can wear it under his flight suit. I'm sure plenty of people would buy them."
5,Goes with Everything,"I received this shirt for my birthday. It goes well with everything. Jeans, Shorts, Sweats, a Suit. It makes any outfit better. Can be worn to schools, work, playgrounds, weddings, funerals. Anywhere!"
1,WTH?,"I think I got a defective shirt.When I opened the box it jumped out and bit me (hard)which is not what I was hoping for based the other customer's experiences that I had read.I say it is defective because it isn't shaped like the shirt in the picture, it has four arms and a tail...what am I supposed to do with a tail on a sweet shirt? I figured that I could wash it to get it to stop barking and maybe shrink it up so I can look so good when I'm polishing my Camaro but I'ven been kinda dizy since first layin eyes on it (the town Doc says I got the rabies but i say I got the spirit of the Wolf in me!)I ordered the Tiger shirt so I should be set until my wolf shirt replacement is in stock."
5,DELIGHT,"I was awed when I received my 3 Wolve Tee. With all the reviews I have read was about to become reality.I wore my Tee under my srubs and I could feel the power of the wolve spirits overcoming me. But as soon as I had a ice cold glass of TUSCAN milk, it was all over but the crying. I was able to help the Doc's in OR with Brain and Transplant surgery, I was able to conquer the mighty toe fungus problems, was able to have unwanted facial hair removed and tattoo's removed with ease. All the nurses swooned around me and wanted me to go to lunch with them. Man Oh Man.........The US should send the 3 Wolve Tees to all the troops in EYE-WRECK, when they put the tee on that will be the true ""SHOCK AND AWE"". If I had this tee when I was in VEE-IT-NAM, charlie would spot fighting, Uncle Ho would drop to his knee's and say ""NO MO"" and General Gap would be zapped.Peace to all the wolve wearers."
5,wolves are better in a pack,"I ordered this shirt as a gift to myself. The dark background is shaded and the wolves seem to glow off the light of the moon and little stars. The wolves have nice detail to them as they howl at the moon.This item is more masculine looking. Would make a great gift for any man who loves the ""call of the wild"" thing. Comes in various sizes up to 3XL which is nice for the fuller figure guys out there. Fast shipping too! I like this shirt so much I will order one for my husband."
1,What the Heck?!,"So after a week of anxiously awaiting the arrival of my wolf shirt couldn't wait to try out its magical properties.So after putting on the shirt and admiring myself in the mirror for several hours I decided to head out the streets...or as I like to call it ""Going on the Prowl""After spotting my first target aka a ""Foxy"" Lady, I headed over to her and put this shirt to good use. While attempting put my wolf like moves on her, I got peppered sprayed in the eyes!What's up with that? I give it a one star for awesome shirt. But nothing more. Be warned this shirt has powers beyond my comprehension."
5,The night i became hungry like 3 wolves,"STRADDLE THE LINE, IN DISCORD AND RHYME, IM ON THE HUNT IM AFTER YOU..... MOUTH IS ALIVE WITH JUICES LIKE WINE, AND I'M HUNGRY LIKE THE WOLF...... i saw this shirt and brought me back to 1984, cruisin the streets in my z-cavariccis and peglegged rollup... i remember cruisin around in my t-top camarro on the way to strawberries records store to pick up the new poster of samantha fox.... i was cool, i had it all, the world at my fingertips... i remember throwin my Duran Duran tape into my pullout face bose system on the dash and rockin out.... HUNGRY LIKE A WOLF....... i was strong like 3 wolves then, id like to have those times back... I put on this shirt, and im hungry like a wolf just one more time!!!"
5,Awesome,"Note that once wearing that shirt I gained the ability to lactate ambergris by clenching my buttocks. Not only is it quite tasty on a day-old baguette, but it also resolves the conundrum of forgetting ones SPF-70 Coppertone and feeling the urge to curl the sleeves up to show ones `guns'."
5,YES!,"Before I saw this t-shirt I believed Jesus was a wolf, now I have my proof. After buying this t-shirt I became a monk and went to live in the hills. This t-shirt comes equipped with moon and wolves, essential to any extreme camper!After surviving various panther attacks I returned only to let my faith grow, and to try and spread the magic to as many as I can.I would recommend this godlike vessel to anyone who has ever believed, and even for those who don't, so, one day, you may stare at the moon and whisper, I know...."
3,Confused...,"Are those 3 really big wolves? Or 1 very tiny moon?I think it's 1 very tiny moon, because the bottom wolf is obviously balancing it on his nose."
4,A Strange Combination Of Heavenly Bodies,Most clothing is going to stop at a single theme - maybe a rhinestone apple on jeans; a witty slogan on a T-shirt or the name of a bar...but this shirt has THREE animals AND a celestial body! When I heard that the canines on the shirt enraged Michael Vick - I knew I had to have one.
2,"Ok, but no XXXXXXLG option","I was disappointed that they don't offer this shirt in my size. I was looking forward to howling at the moon with some ladies, but this shirt left me with a mid-drift that failed to help me attract any action at my family reunion. I'm returning this and plan to go back to my Homer dress--so much more comfortable!"
5,"Hey, nice wolf shirt.","I thought I was in trouble when I got caught in a recent race riot but lo and behold, this shirt got me outta that pickle!What a conversation starter!"
3,It Scared My Cats!,"I purchased this fine looking shirt with the highest of hopes but found it's powers lacking. Looking good is one thing but now my cats are scared of me too. In fact, the only thing this shirt attracted was people with similar (if not as attractive) wolf shirts. I was able to scare up a softball team with my new friends but nobody comes to watch. All in all I'd say it improved my life tremendously."
3,versatile,"I got this shirt as a gift and love it's versatility. This shirt came in so handy for my busy day. I had a jammed packed day that started with a Walmart trip and ended with a wedding and tailgate reception. I paired the wolf shirt with my good sweats for my shopping trip and dressed it up for the wedding with a t-shirt clip and good jeans. The best part was all the men at the reception that were approaching me to show me their wolf howling at the moon tattoos. I had the satisfaction of saying, ""HA! my shirt is way better than your tat because my shirt has THREE wolves howling at the moon!"" What a wonderful day that was."
5,The Lone Wolf's Suit of Armor,"The wolves are my friends and advise me what to do in normal, every day situations. I no longer have to use my conscience, which is so awesome! The spirit nature gods of the desert sometimes visit me at night and urge me to discontinue my mundane everyday existence, and to transcend into a Spirit Coyote. One fateful day, I returned this call. The next morning, I woke up and found myself gorged on Slim Jims and Kool Aid in the school supplies section of Walmart. It was the best thing that has ever happened to me. EVAR."
2,Not Keith Moon,"Nuts, I though this was 3 wolfs howling at Keith Moon - sort of an old Who reunion pic, cause Entwistle and Townshend used to look sort of wolfish. Turns out that big round thing isn't a drum - what the heck?"
1,Is it possible to sue?,Yeah so I thought this shirt was going to be so sweet... I bought this shirt and this shirt has nearly been the complete unraveling of my being. Since buying this shirt I have been spending too much time out with the ladies. Ladies cannot get enough of this shirt thankfully I ordered it in quantity of 7 so that I could wear one everyday of the week. The ladies are always tearing at me and tackling me because of the magnetism that this shirt possesses. I cannot sleep I cannot eat I've lost my job due to a lack of sleep ladies leave me along please.
5,Six stars! But one problem...,"First of all, this shirt has cured my blindness. I didn't think that process was reversible, if you know what I mean (and I think you do).So there's that.I'm beyond satisfied, therefore, with the shirt itself. However, I do have a problem. I'm afraid to launder it. What if its power lies not it its awesome iconography but in the actual essence of the three wolves themselves, somehow transubstantiated into T-shirt imprint form?? Is it possible that detergent might somehow vitiate or even mutate their power?? I dare not risk that possibility.So, yeah, I'm wearing this shirt. Forever."
5,A real review,"Pretty funny, everybody. Actually, I love this shirt, no matter what people write. I imagine if I dressed in Armani or Ralph Lauren I might be accepted by the social critics who have left reviews on this item. Frankly, I love wolves, I love the moon, I love black, I love this shirt, and, yes, I love my sister. Perhaps, in an inappropriate manner. But, who's to judge?And, by the way, I don't live in a trailer, not since the eviction. And, I plan to wear my three wolf T-shirt to my upcoming appearance on The Jerry Springer Show. Go ahead and make fun of the show, but they never wrote an opera about Donohue or Oprah.By the way, I've written the company that manufactures this shirt and, while not promising anything, there just may be a dogs-playing-poker shirt someday soon."
5,Third nipple Gone!!!,"OK, so I thought, whatever - wolf shirt with moon - no big deal, but it'll go nice with my blue/grey/black camouflage pants. But lo and behold, my supernumerary nipple disappeared!! Go Wolf shirt!!"
2,Not formal enough,They need to make this shirt with a collar. How can I pop my collar when there is no collar to pop?
5,'Nuff said...,The most common other items viewed by people who buy this shirt are a 2 gallon of whole milk and an American Flag T-Shirt. Seriously. To be the best you need to drink like the best and look like the best. 'Nuff said.-Sam aka Berzerker aka The Wiz
5,I piss excellence!!!,From the Kenny Powers collection...this matches perfectly with any mullet. the key is to either tuck this shirt of pure awesomeness into your blck stone washed jeans or buy it just a little too small so that all of the world can view that gurthy happy trail.
3,"Okay, but I can't get it off",I bought this shirt and it was pretty cool but I got stuck in the rain and then it dried and it shrank so it is stuck on my body. It looks pretty good but I just wish I could get it off.
4,changed my friday,"as soon as i read about this t-shirt, i decided to shut down my computer and go drink a beer. if i get pulled over on the way home, i will blame the t-shirt on my bad luck."
3,Why isn't this on QVC?,"So I just had to get my XXXXL Teee shirt. Now why the sam hell wasn't this on QVC? I talk to the QVC operator Samantha every day, she must miss me today.I had to get my great great grandson Billeh Joe to go on the interaaaaanets to get me this shirt. Such a handsome gifted lil fella, lookin' just like his papy every day at the age of 23. He's best get married fast ya'll! Hes a pappy himself of 18 already.My great niece nellie looked so beautiful in her three wolf tshirt when we had us a girls night out at the Home Town Buffet. We were all wearing our curlers lookin' our best in our house slippers. The men were all giving her winks at our visit to Sam's Club, Walmart and our late night bar hoppin' at applebees.And its best time to get me a new cowboy.. Yeee hawww"
1,Stupid annoying tag in my face,"This shirt has done NOTHING for me! Well, except for a damn tag in my face all day! I have had no women all over my junk. I have not experienced any magical powers of any sort. Kind of tight on the front of my neck, but loose on the back, weird. I tried howling when I was wearing it, but just got looks. None of the good has come with this shirt except for the fits the girth well thing, that one was perfect. I will keep trying this shirt for a couple more weeks to see if my luck changes, but as of now no luck for me. I do sometimes get a quick look, but then it turns to confusion and they look away. Hmm...**UPDATE**- So I have noticed something with this shirt...My back muscles are getting huge! I don't know what it is, but more to come."
5,Tsunami,"It has been confirmed that of all the victims in the Tsunami disaster, none were wearing a 3 wolves shirt."
1,"Quite a Bite, the wolves do have...","First, let me say that our dryer is new (bought two months ago) and has never acted strangely. After the first time washing this shirt, however, I noticed something unusual. All the other shirts and socks that had accompanied the wolves shirt during the drying process came out with mysterious bite markings. One shirt was deemed useless by the damage, and several socks looked more like waded hunks of frayed cotton. The only item left untouched was - well I won't even insult your intelligence; I'm sure you've already guessed it. Anyway, be forewarned, the instructions may say ""use gentle cycle"", but the wolves are quite rough, regardless..."
4,i found my nuggets,after wearing this i found my chicken mcnuggets i been looking for all week my mama had them
3,wolf review,"Very nice depiction of free wolves doing what they do best,howling.However the 2x size really is an xl. My shirt was too small so I gave it to my wife."
5,Love it,"I bought this t-shirt off of the actual website for my boyfriend. It's kickass and looks amazing. It's now one of his favorite shirts. It's great quality and the color is awesome. He loves it and he loves wolves so it all works out ^__^ The shirt size runs a little small though, it says it on their actual website. So if you plan on getting a shirt by them you should always go a size up because it's better to be bigger than smaller."
2,Very Disappointed,"When I received this product and opened the package, I was instantly awed by it's majestic and wolfie awesomeness. I snuggled with it for several nights, unable to even think of possibly unleashing something this fabulous on the general public. A few days later, I broke down and did wear it out of the house while attending bingo. And, nothing. Nada. NOTHING HAPPENED.Come to find out, this shirt only works when paired with the Wolf Urine Lure - 32oz! I ended up having to purchase that seperately adding additonal cost including shipping!That being said, once they are coupled together, the sheer magnificence of this combo truly does stand out. People have fainted, wolves howl, deer run in fear. There wasn't one person at the D&D; convention who didn't comment on how fantastic I looked.So, do yourself a favor and buy the combo right off the bat. You won't be disappointed!"
4,Black?,I love the design BUT the color of the actual tee did not look black it looked more greenish/ blue its an odd color but i still love it.
4,the miracles continue,"The quality of the shirt is OK, the coincidences at the time I order it / received it, well yes, it does seem to be a lucky shirt.Three Wolf Moon The Mountain Tee ShirtAnd I haven't even worn it yet... Good luck to you!"
1,"This shirt changed my life, for the worse!","I must say the shirt is Awesome! Unfortunately i could not harness its power and when i bought it after being lonely for some time, the babes started falling off trees, my penis grew 1 inch magically, and i got a promotion. Everything i touched seem to turn to gold. I was on top of the world. Unfotunately, unlike the wolf, i got greedy. My cup fillith over and i found myself with jealous bitches and genital herpes. The shirt that brought magic and charisma had been my downfall. I lay wondering, how such a magical weapon could lead me to such chaos. If you buy this shirt, please dont abuse the power of the wolf shirt. I beg of you, please dont."
3,Meh.,"Meh.I mean, it was okay, sort-of. Some wolves, okay. The moon, sweet. But overall, mediocre shirt with mediocre powers."
1,consumed by tragedy.,"Since i first donned this shirt, I have been overwhelmed by a desire to urinate in all the corners of my home. And yesterday, I growled at my mom when she told me to stop licking my privates. Come to think of it, i'm thinking of changing my rating to five stars."
1,Effects greatly exaggerated. Disappointing.,"I bought this shirt because who doesn't want to kiss a girl, right? But guess I'll just have to keep on waiting, except for online. I wore this shirt out to a bar and sat there for like four hours and no one even talked to me! I tried to talk to this one girl who was pretty but she just gave me that look my dad used to give me before he left mom, and then wouldn't turn around even after I kept poking her. Then she just got up and left. There is a good chance she didn't get a good look at the shirt, though. But this other girl did. She was like, nice dress, and I mean I did order it in XXL which is really big on me, even bigger than mom's clothes, but how could anyone think this was a dress?? You could see my cargo shorts and even if they were camoflauge LOL. Whatever. Don't expect anything great from this shirt. I put mine on the dog and he loves it. He runs and runs and it looks like a batman cape!"
1,Conspiracy,"I believe this shirt is responsible for the demise of Kennedy, Elvis and Archduke Franz Ferdinand (who has three names.) It's all about threes. As we all know, wolves are evil (remember: Beauty and the Beast and White Fang? Irrefutible evidence) and the evil number 3 combined to make a cataclysmic portrayal of super evil. In one extremely portable evil-projector - a 100% cotton T-Shirt!! DO NOT BE FOOLED by the ""environmentally friendly ink!"" - it's an obvious ploy to get us to trust them! (I'm still working on who ""them"" are.) Anyway, I have some more newspapers to paste to my basement wall, but if I were you I'd also be wary of the fact that it's short-sleeved, if nothing else."
5,A magical moment....,"It was one of those rare moments that one only sees on the Lifetime Channel but it happened to me. I was at the local speedway on a Saturday night, Bud Light in one hand, Twizzlers in the other, when I glanced across the bleachers and saw the most handsome man wearing this shirt. By coincidence I had the female version of it on, the Graceful White Wolves lavender t-shirt, and our eyes met. To make a long story short...one thing led to another and now we are married [...] ..Thanks Amazon."
3,HOOOOOWL!,"Jacob fans, rejoice! Now, you don't have to buy an overpriced official Twilight shirt - just purchase this gorgeous and comfy tee, and show your loyalty to the pack! I bought mine and since then throngs of screaming tweens have been flocking to me asking me where I got it."
1,Complete Bullcrap,"When it arrived in the mail, nothing. No special powers. No hot women were mindlessly attracted to me. Women actually avoided me and said they would call the police if I even made eye contact. I put the shirt on and people starting snickering and calling me racial slurs of all kinds. Not a happy camper, not at all. At work, my boss punched me in the stomach and then said, ""that's what you get!"" I couldn't take the ridicule and starting crying like a 12 year old school girl at Justin Bieber concert. I've had such a horrible time wearing this shirt that I'm about to take it off and...FML! I have it on inside-out."
5,The shirt my bosoms were made for,"I love how this shirt fits and smells. I love the way the wolves cling to my bosoms. This shirt makes me feel so good inside. I wear it every Saturday night when I go out. I get in my car with my wolf shirt, turn on my iPod to ""Angry like a Wolf"" and just start swaying to the music. Why do I need a man when I have my three wolfs shirt? Love it, five stars. Oh Yeah...."
5,Powerful Shirt,"My boyfriend was pretty down in the dumps...He wasn't ready for marriage, lost his job, and was pretty sour all the way around. Then I saw the rave reviews regarding the three wolf t-shirt. My first reaction was to save money for the gas bill and not buy this shirt. After a few glasses of Boone's Farm watermelon, I thought better of this hasty decision. I was waiting with bated breath for my parcel to arrive. The moment I felt the vibration of the package. I knew my life had changed. As my boyfriend shuffled from the sofa to catch a glimpse of the commotion, I handed him his gift. Long story short: The very next day, the lottery ticket (sitting in between his Early Times and can of Skoal) turned out to hold the winning numbers. He ran to collect OUR earnings (in his Wolf shirt). Drove home in OUR brand new Maserati and got down on bended knee. For those disbelievers/naysayers/spendthrifts: take my advice and BUY this amazing THREE WOLF MOON SHIRT. You simply can't go wrong!"
4,Great shirt -- doesn't fit,"I got this shirt as a gift, and, like you, I'm in awe of the rugged, individualistic style all three canis lupus. Why doesn't it get five stars then? Well, It's just an XL. Where are my other two X's???"
1,A Dangerous Hazard,"I bought this shirt a few months ago but had to return it last week due to tragic circumstances.I wore it out and was promptly descended on by myriads of supermodels: so far so good. Later on however I wore it to the local store.A young child was there with his mother and he pulled his mother's arm and yelled out ""Look mummy, a wolf, a wolf, a wolf. Three wolfs [sic]"".I learned later that week that the child had been later savaged by a pack of feral dogs and no one had come to help him."
5,Three Wolves = Man Juice power,"I was skeptic on buying this shirt. Reading the reviews, whether fake or not, kinda put me on the fence about this particular shirt.Then I ordered the shirt. Received it today. Opened the package and a ray of golden light shined in my face in the form of 3 wolves howling at the moon.I instantly cried. I never cry. My dad was struck blind-deaf and stupid after an automobile accident that left him paralyzed, didn't cry when he died.My mom was taken from me when she went out for a pack of smokes in Bronx, didn't cry then either. But this shirt made me cry.The sheer magnitude of this awesome shirt makes me wanna cry.I put on the shirt and almost like a thunderbolt had struck my back, I felt empowered. Thats because the moment i put the shirt on, I was struck by lightening.I'm in the hospital now, the doctors recommend I take off my shirt to perform certain surgeries but I refused. If I go, my shirt goes too."
1,I HATE this shirt and it's stupid wolves!!!,"I bought this supposedly ""great"" shirt for my ex boyfriend back when he wasn't an ex yet. He Lovvvvvvvved it! He wore it to the grocery store to get a loaf of bread. Ha! He got bread alright. He got himself a new girlfriend with the shirt I bought for that low life! Yeah, and she's younger, prettier, blonder, [...], makes more money, drives a nicer car, owns a nicer house and doesn't even have a drug problem! Whatever. Everybody LOVVVES the 3 wolf shirt. But only because you never think about those of us who are really HURT by this terrible Tee! Thanks for nuthin 3 Wolves. I want a refund and a new boyfriend!"
5,Owwwwhhhh owwww owww owwwwhhh,"Simply stated I was born without any limbs and am paralyzed from the neck down, but after I donned the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt I am happy to say I can finally walk and even ride a bike (Awesome!). This shirt is %100 Cotton, but it's also %110 a miracle worker."
1,Buch of crap,"So I bought this shirt expecting all the sweetness of chicks and power of gods and here's what happened:First the box was very difficult to open, who has the strength to open these things?Next I put on the shirt expecting something magnificent, turns out I'm allergic to the dye used and my body blew up twice the size of the shirt and can't get it off, its stuck on.My arm pits wont stop secreting a weird milk smell.The only girls that seem to want to talk to me are very large and hostile.I think I'm just gonna stick with the kitten shirts thank you."
1,My boss is now a bigger tool,"I bought this shirt for my boss for his birthday. I wanted to see if the so-called ""power"" it wielded could turn my boss into an even bigger pompous tool than he already is. Well, suffice to say I no longer just make his coffee, I have to make it & sing Ave Maria as I pour it in his cup at promptly 7:59am every morning. [...] wolf shirt."
1,Get my name right!!!!,"Don't buy this shirt! My name is Eric, but whenever I wear this shirt people call me ""Epic"". So annoying!!!"
5,Suggestive to women!,This shirt is so laced with testosterone that all women will succumb to its power. I wore this shirt when i was with my girlfriend and she was all over me. This shirt def has awesome powers. Every man should have one!
3,Just a basic shirt,"Nothing special. The art is well done, but other than that, just a basic shirt, despite all protestations to the contrary above."
1,hahaha,These reviews are so unbelievably lame. I send my friends here to laugh at you idiots. The shirt is stupid.
5,Wolf Moon Metaphor,"The shirt fits like crap. But what it means to me intellectually more than makes up for the mediocrity of en masse production.When I look at this shirt, I am immediately harkened to Greek Mythological lore. I believe that the wolves represent the 3 oracles that predicted Oedipus would kill his father and partake in private bedroom matters with his mother. Being from Arkansas, you can see why anything related to Oedipus would appeal to me. The man is an icon and a role model for me.So, this shirt is a constant reminder of that for me, so I wear it daily.Oh yeah, chicks dig it too."
4,3 Wolf Moon - To Be Censored?,"Yes, the rumors are true: Wal-Mart has commissioned The Mountain to make them 10,000 3 Wolf Moon Shirts. Unfortunately, these shirts will be cheaply made, and will not rival the quality shirts you can buy from places like Pierce This 2 here on Amazon. You certainly get what you're willing to pay for. Considering Wal-Mart's price, and it's history, I'm sure that any magic inherent in the 3 Wolf Moon T-shirts will be highly censored. Thanks, but no thanks, WM; I'd rather keep my quality shirt than any cheapies available at your store. (Actually, wouldn't it be great if 3WM t-shirt owners could gather as a pack at their local Wal-Mart and howl it up outside?!?)"
2,"Too much moon, too little wolf","The ""Three Wolf Moon Tee-Shirt"" by ""The Mountain"" is terribly lacking in Wolves. The Wolf per Dollar ratio on this shirt is way too low. Save your money on this one my friends. Most people prefer the ""Five Wolves Run Through the Forest Tee-Shirt"" by ""Cool Grafixxx"" or the ""Four Wolves Devour a Dead Stag Sleeveless Tee-Shirt"" by ""Mooncity Madmen Tees"". If you go for the classics, like myself, opt for the ""Six Wolves Playing Poker Hoodie"" by ""Big Yuks Tees & Things"". Remember, nothing says ""classy"" like the classics. ..and also maybe Ninjas. Ninjas are sooooo sweet. How cool would a ""Seven Ninjas Riding Wolves Tee-Shirt"" be? That would score the most. I'm going to make one of those right now. Can I borrow a Sharpie, a glue gun, some sequins and a pack of Slim-Jims?"
5,What about the nebula?,"Like many others, I bought the shirt because of the rave reviews about the three wolves and the moon. Being a professional cosmologist, I couldn't help but also notice the strange stars and cosmic nebula hiding ""in plain sight"" BEHIND the wolves. Well, after purchasing mine, I ran the star and nebula pattern in our cosmological computer models, and lo and behold, I discovered not only the cause of the Big Bang and Cosmic Expansion, but now we know the secret to faster-than-light space travel. The wolves are pointing the way to the stars! The only conclusion possible is that this shirt was brought to mankind by super intelligent three headed canine aliens, who had decided after the original moon landings that we were ready for space travel, and only now after 40 years have silk screen technology and computers caught up so that we could finally unlock the secret."
5,Its all true,So I saw the ABC news story on this and said lookit all the loosers getting sucked in on the hype. Then I felt bad and thought that was harsh so I ordered one off Amazon. I posted that it arrived on my facebook page and for the first time ever a female wrote something to me. Strange coincidence but it made me feel nice. I left the shirt on my car seat at lunch when I went in for some fast food and when I returned two hot girls were looking in the window ...is that a GENUINE 3 wolf moon shirt? the perky one asked yes I said and they both got all excited and bubbly. Nice car too the other one said while I left thinking I should have offered them a ride but I was too nervious. Hopefully when I am wearing it I will get more power. the early report is this shirt is looking good. And 100% cotton too!
2,No verisimilitude,"The image is lovely but, c'mon, it's SO photoshopped. There's no way they could have gotten wolves to pose like that."
1,This was a gift from my friend Jacob.,"I moved to Forks, WA about three years ago. My best friend Jacob is a Native American. He bought me this shirt for my birthday. I don't know what it is, but this shirt really gives you good luck. In fact, one snowy afternoon, a runaway van in the school parking lot skidded on the ice and almost crushed me. Luckily, it was a near miss. Guess what- yep, I was wearing The Shirt. Another time, I was shopping in Gig Harbor and wound up in a dark alley. Some hooligans started following me but some guy pulled up in a Volvo and scared them away. Yep, I was wearing the same shirt. THEN, I took a trip down to Phoenix and went to visit my old dance studio. Some creepy vampire tried to attack me but a really cute vampire showed up and rescued me. Again, I just happened to be wearing The Shirt. Coincidence?"
5,From van to shirt,"I remember the old days, when a man had to airbrush his own 3 wolves and a moon onto his own Chevy van, and cruise up and down the West coast as an itinerant carpenter, lookin for ladies who liked to party down. That was real art.Or maybe a man used to have to hang out at Steppenwolf concerts, making T-shirts in the back of his Chevy van like this when he wasn't carvin' sweet wolf profiles into redwood and sellin em at rest stops on I5 out of Bakersfield.Now you've got it all in one mass-produced shirt.Feel the magic. Feel the soul of the wolf.-Lobo"
2,Beware of extra shipping costs!,"I ordered the XX-Large size Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt and was charged an extra $5.95 for shipping costs for this shirt. When the shirt arrived, it was packaged in an XX-Large size headless corpse. I wasn't sure if this was the XX-Large size headless corpse that I had ordered that just happened to be wearing the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt since, you know, it's so popular. So I ordered another Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt, this time for size 2-4 years. Sure enough, I was once again charged an extra $5.95 for shipping costs when it arrived worn by a headless toddler, age approximately 2-4 years.Buyer beware! If I wanted to order a headless corpse, I can get one for much cheaper than the $5.95 shipping cost! Most free corpses come with free shipping!"
2,A Dissapointment,"I usually buy a lot of stuff on Amazon, but I have to admit, Walmart and the local truck stop sell these for a little cheaper: $5.99 or 4 for $20.I'm also a little dissapointed that I cant find any acid wash, side zip jeans here on Amazon to go with it.Overall, this is a great shirt, but side note: I've seemed to attract a lot of mullet sporting men lately... what's up with that??"
4,An actual review,"I just recieved my shirt in the mail (it took about a week to arrive) and the shirt fits perfectly, so the sizing is correct. The wolves and moon are crystal clear and looks exactly like how it's pictured EXCEPT it has a small logo on the bottom right side; it's not that distracting, but still, I wasn't expecting there to be a logo, it kind of takes away from the art and feeling you get when you look at it. Also, if you order it in black, it's actually a dark dark green, so now you know. All in all, I'm pretty satisfied with my shirt and I can't wait to show it off!"
5,My awesome journey,"I first bought this shirt stupidly thinking ""Will this really give me powers?"" When I first put it on I felt the mystikal power. I was taken away by a group of flying monkeys into a black hole which took me to their lair. I was then just about to be attacked by their pet rabid banana when the 3 wolfs came off my shirt and and ued their rainbow farts to make the banana implode. Then the 3 wolves combined to form Megan Fox who kissed me on me lips which then I was shot out of a canon into my house which then I had a heart attack because of all the awesomeness the shirt gave me. I then came back from the dead to right this review."
5,"Three wolf moon, yes please.",I just purchased this t-shirt and I already feel a surge of magical energy. Anyone who does not own this shirt will never know the power of pure joy. Now everyone will know how much of a Boss I am when they gaze upon the trinity of wolves.
1,Ripoff!,"I ordered a Three Dog Night album.Not funny. It ruined an expensive turntable. Refund, please."
3,Request more than a review,"Can you do this same shirt, but with 3 chinchillas rather than wolves? I'd also like a chest pocket added for cigarettes. Blend the pocket into the moon though. Please let me know if you can do this. Thanks."
3,Warning,"hi, i read some reveiws on this shirt and was imediatly inticed by its supposed power. well i had to see for my self. i am not a great person. i lie, cheat, steal and anything generly uncooth. upon doning this shirt imediatly contracted a case of hemroids."
5,Designed by a Man Raised in a Roundhouse,It was rumored that the original artist for the T-Shirt was none other than the World's Greatest Human...Chuck Norris
1,shirt discriminates,"Why is there no Asian wolf? Clearly there is a Caucasian, African, and Mexican wolf, but 'conveniently' any depiction of the Asian wolf was left out. I discovered this while wearing the shirt and it occurred to me that the Asian wolf may exist on the back of the shirt. I've tried to see my back, but can't reach that far yet. I'll keep trying, but first I need to lick my elbow."
1,The trashy version,"Don't be fooled. This is not the same 3 wolves shirt. After buying numerous original 3 wolves shirts from the other listing, I needed to save some money, so when it came time to reorder, I choose this version instead. Sadly wearing this shirt did not produce the same lady mojo that I got from the originals. It really is the white trash version of the shirt.Don't be fooled, buy the original, not this one.Pros: If I was into chicks who can't even afford a trailer home, this would be awesome. I'm not. I want a roof over my head and wheels hidden by trim under.Cons: Easily mistaken for the original shirts when I wash them all together, can only tell when I hit the DQ and no one looks at me when I wear it. I keep spares in my trunk for this reason."
3,"Epic shirt, but faded after 1 wash","Wore this shirt to work and was immediately complemented on it.3 different occasions I was told ""I love that shirt""Never have I received such feedback from an article of clothing!The black did fade after washing, but people still like it."
5,Wolf Pack!,"Before I got this shirt, I thought of myself as a one man wolf pack. After having received this shirt as a gift (thanks Dave!), I now consider myself a wolf pack of 4. Awesome!"
5,The future will be bright in 2010,My brother has had some bad luck in the past few months and he says doesnt know what to do to make the next year better than the past so I bought him this shirt Im so sure the wolf pack will let him be part of them and the leaders will show him the way.When he opens his present on christmas morning the wolves will jump out and howl. aaaawooooooooooooow He could even be the next tiger woods because women will be pouncing on him.
4,3 wolf moon,The graphics on the shirt are phenomenal! Detail is excellent. You will want to show it to everyone. The fit is perfect. The ONLY negative is that I wish the T-shirt material was of a heavier quality. I will buy another one or two or three......
1,Oy gevalt!,"I got this shirt as a joke gift for Hanukkah. Several nights later I carelessly wore it to bed (I was out of clean pj tees). DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID! I woke up to find my circumcision had been inexplicably reversed and a flaming Viking skeleton warrior battle scene tattoo had been carved onto my chest, shoulders, stomach and back - everywhere that the shirt had been touching my skin. And to top it off, it was the 25th and Santa had visited and left me a crate of chewing tobacco, a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon and 4 lbs. of back bacon... under a Christmas tree. Try explaining that one to the Rabbi! The worst part of all this is now I have to get circumcised again."
3,Head's Up if you decide to create your own 3 Wolf/Moon shirt!!,"I had a friend who wanted the shirt but couldn't afford it. He decided to make his own 3 Wolf/Moon shirt at home. I told him that this was probably not a good idea. There are forces at work in any multiple wolf/moon shirt that we, as humans, know nothing about. He could wind up tearing a whole in space/time, causing Micronesia to be swalled by the ocean or summon the ancient Wolf God and burn in its Living Fire for all eternity.FYI...he didn't listen to me. Now, my friend is missing, there are giant wolf/bear creatures stalking the neighborhood, the sky is blood red and the spot where his house was is now a screaming vortex that leads to a Nightmare dimension. Dumbass.Other than that, this shirt rocks like none other."
5,Baby Machine!,"My wife and I have been trying to get pregnant for years. We've tried everything you can imagine, yet nothing worked. After reading the reviews here I decided to buy the 3 wolf shirt. As soon as I put the shirt on I could feel a tingling sensation - it was almost paralyzing. I quickly grabbed my wife and headed for the bedroom. 2 hours later she was pregnant - with triplets. This shirt has been a miracle.I've since quit my job and make a living donating to the sperm bank - I'm the number one pick!Thanks again three wolf moon shirt!"
5,The Power of The Wolf,"After realizing the alluring and mystical powers this Wolf shirt contains. I had to immediately purchase this shirt. I soon realized that this shirt increased my Chuck Norrisness (Sex Appeal, Karate, Manliness, and all around desire to be befriended by all). I then pondered while spitting my chew in to an old coke bottle. I would like to thank my John Nicholas from the local Jiffy Lube who enlightened me to the power of the wolves."
5,The Coming Apocalypse,"The first incarnation of this shirt, (made of three wolf skins under a full moon while howling,) caused the Tanguska Event of 1908...you have been warned."
4,Choice Garb,"Pros: Comes in Extra Medium sizes, Matches the Winger mirror I won at the Carnival. Ring Toss Y'all!!!Cons: Not available in a Mesh Half Shirt."
5,Awsome,I came to this site looking for a nice two wolf shirt maybe with one black wolf and one white wolf. Then I saw this three wolf shirt and instantly ordered it. Upon receiving it I put it on. Now my bucket seats look sweet. I hope I can afford to buy another one for the passenger seat before they are sold out. A Trans-Am can't have too many Three Wolf Shirts.
1,Humanity is not ready for this shirt,"The people who made this shirt clearly didn't see the danger inherent in what they were doing.The issue is that the existence of successful one and two wolf shirt prototypes meant that this shirt's creators didn't require any discipline to attain this achievement.They didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves, so they don't take any responsibility for it. They stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as they could, and before they even knew what they had, they've patented it, and packaged it, and begun to sell it.I attempted to wear this shirt, and immediately grew six inches, resulting in heinous bone deformities in my legs. I will never walk again.Furthermore, while navigating my school on a wheelchair, a group of women threw themselves at my feet. I was unable to stop my wheelchair in time and all of them were killed in the collision.Humanity is simply not ready for this kind of power."
5,Its all about the packaging,I knew that I was in for a treat when I opened the package and saw that my shirt had been sent to me packed not in styrofoam peanuts but instead padded with wolf hair and deer skins. The exterior of the box was riddled with bullet holes yet upon inspection the shirt was unscathed. I can only attribute this to the shirt's overall badass-ery-ness.
5,Wonderful Wolf,"Just got the shirt in the mail today (almost a week ahead of time) and simply love it. It it looks like it does online,looks like it will fits well, and un-like other one star reviews I have read the colors are bright and viberent. There is also not flaking of the ""paint"" off the shirt. If you like wolf related items or know someone who does I suggest this t-shirt or other wolf t-shirts from this company.So far I can not attest to the magical properties of the shirt have not tried it on yet. Will edit my review if I do get any of the abilities others have claimed."
5,Arrrroooooo!,"I only regret that I have so few stars to give. I'm cunning and agile by nature, so I was immediately drawn to the shirt, and having worn it for a few weeks now, having communed with it, I know I've found my home. I can only hope the company doesn't set about trying to make improvements on it. If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
5,Inside Information,"Most people don't know this but the shirt designers were originally going to put a 4th wolf in the upper right, but decided that perhaps the use of white space (black space) would create a more effective design. But after thinking about it for a solid fortnight, the designers said F the whitespace, which is short for forget the whitespace, and put a moon in its place. True story."
5,Couldn't have asked for better,"Nothing spells rugged good looks more than three wolves howling at the moon. As other reviewers have pointed out, this three wolf edition is a superior model to the two wolf tee. Sometimes people say its not wise to get the latest and greatest, but I say otherwise"
1,Three Wolves Are Not Enough,"Face it, in today's world everyone and their mom has 3 Wolves and a Moon. This t-shirt is for posers only. The natural progression would be 4 Wolves and 2, maybe even 3 Moons, but I suggest buying the t-shirt of a wolf riding a phoenix to the center of the moon, you'll get laid more."
1,There are no LOL Cats on the back!?!,"Our customers [...] frequently buy the product, fully expecting it to do something that the product does not do, and which the product description clearly indicates it doesn't do. Naturally, therefore, I expected this Three Wolf Tee to magically arrive in a Baby Doll cut, with LOL Catz on the back. It was cut for middle aged fat guys, JUST LIKE IN THE PICTURE!!! and there wasn't a single LOL Cat on the back at all! When will you be adding LOL Catz to the back of my T Shirt, and when will you ship an upgrade for my shirt which refactors it into a baby doll cut? IF YOU DON'T PLAN TO DO THIS, LET ME KNOW BECAUSE I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! This t-shirt doesn't even RUN on my iPhone. I can't believe you developers. I'm going to report you to Apple."
3,YOU GUYS ARE LAME! an ok shirt tho,people think this shirt's funny or at least its reviews are. so uhh yeah it's good to attract those kind of people( unfunny people who are unoriginal )an ok shirt though. keeps the flies off my back
1,Unsolicited,This product page uploads automatically into my browser without my having actively done anything. I do have no interests in t-shirts of any kind and especially this one. Very annoying.
2,Too large,"I have ordered a large T-Shirt with the wolves on. I received promptly and I looked at it. A T-Shirt is a T-Shirt is a T-Shirt right? I noticed it was quite large so, I washed it in cold water. It has not shrunk at all. The T-Shirt goes down to my knees or almost. Are American blessed with a bigger/larger constitution than Canadians? It is also hard to stuff are this extra material into my jeans. What can I do? Can I return it? But this is a hasstle which I don't need. If I don't get satisfaction, I will never order any kind of clothing thru Amazon or any other company. Thanks"
1,Verrrrry poor quality!!! :(,"I purchased his shirt thinking the image was printed on a good quality shirt. However, I was very disappointed ti have received a low quality fabric and a poor quality picture print.....Don't recommend this product. On the brgt side, I got it much earlier than expected."
1,Don't buy this shirt,If you think this shirts going to do any thing for your love life you are stupid. I just saw a video on yahoo.com by ABC News that said this is one of the most popular shirts on the internet. The guy who first said it helped his love life said he just said it for no real reason and then the shirt just started selling like crazy. Do your self a favor and go get something nicer unless you really like wolfs.
2,Disapointed,"Ordered T shirt in Black, but appeared to be white tee dyed black. Looked kind of green tint. Expected better for the price."
3,The best shirt to wear in Crossroads Mall,This shirt is awesome I wore this shirt to crossroads mall and the mall ratz were all over me I had to beat them off with a stick. This shirt just screams manly I even walked by the t-shirt hut and I could tell I would be the talk of the t-shirt hut for some time after all it is not everyday you see a wonderful shirt like this one! I have also find this shirt comes in particularly handy at Carnivals. Women simply can't keep there eyes off it.
4,Really long,"This shirt is really good quality and my fiance really likes it. The only shortfall so to speak is its length. It's really long. So if you're 6'7"" it'll be a perfect fit."
4,when dogs howl,It is a great-looking tee on my son. I think it has brought him good luck because nothing but good has come out of wearing it!
2,Great Gift Idea!,Bought this as a `cheer me up' present for my second cousin after we lost the baby. She LOVED IT!!!!
1,Not Invincible.,"Contrary to previous reviews, this Tshirt does not stop a 15-Ton-truck ""dead in it's tracks.""Sent from my iPhone at the ICU"
5,Great compliment to my tattoo.,"Unfortunately I already have this exact picture tattooed on my chest, but the shirt really helps when it is cold outside."
5,803 Amazon Prophets can't be wrong!,"Many historical (and even holy) events have centered around mountains - Mt. Sinai where Moses received the Torah, Mount Tabor, site of the Transfiguration by Jesus, Mount Olympus, home of the Greek gods, ""Holy Mountains"" on System of a Down's Hypnotize, but most importantly, The Mountain's Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt, which I believe was heavily mentioned in the (apocryphal) gospels as ""the sign"" we would be looking for.The issuance of this Holy Trinity-esque garb during these troubled times only reinforces the `raised hair on the back of neck-ness' that has haunted me ever since Sr. Michelle freaked out my first grade class with daily warnings that we were horrible sinners and already had one foot inside the gates of hell.This has GOT to be it everyone! 803 Amazon Prophets can't be wrong! The time has come! Repent and redress yourself in the Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt!"
1,So?,"I don't get all the reviews. I've got mine on right now and it's just a shirt??? Wait a minute, how are these words appearing without me touching the keyboard? Oh my God, I'm typing with my mind."
4,This is the only shirt my son ever wears,"I am a 48 year old mother of two. My youngest son Arthur wears this shirt every day. He refuses to take it off, so I had to buy several more identical shirts. I change him into a new shirt every day while he is sleeping so that it does not consistently smell like B.O. I had to buy the extra large version for Arthur and it stretches easily over his little beer belly. Arthur is 24 and I wish he would move out of the home I share with my second husband, Razor. Since Razor and Arthur do not get along, this shirt has improved our lives tenfold because it keeps Arthur smelling fresh during his 36- hour World of Warcraft marathons and does not show sweat stains or other stains if Arthur happens to spill any of his Full Throttle or Monster Energy drinks. The only complaint I have about this product is that it still shows Cheetos dust and especially lint if exposed to the blacklight we have in the basement. -C.M."
1,hmmm...,"I purchased this shirt because it reminded me of my family. However, I discovered upon my first donning of said garment that a wolf wearing a shirt with wolves on it was just way too postmodern. My packmates just didn't ""get it"". I tried to explain the writings of the post-structuralist philosopher Jacques Derrida to justify my purchase, and they just stared at me blankly. I guess that's what I get for being the only wolf in my pack who went to college.I'm giving it one star, because this shirt made me realize that po-mo is a bunch of malarkey reserved for only pretentious canis lupuseseses."
5,Made my Yellowstone trip amazing,"I bought this shirt for the kitschy Internet joke value, and wore it yesterday to Yellowstone National Park. During my six-hour drive through the northern loop of the park, I saw three herds of buffalo, some mountain goats, a female moose with her calf, several elk, and no less than eight different bears--two black bears, three young grizzlies, and a mother grizzly with two cubs. I am told that seeing that many bears in one day is incredibly unusual, but when you're wearing Three Wolf Moon I guess it's just a regular day.PRODUCT RATING: A+PROS: comfortable, kitschy, apparently attracts bearsCONS: runs a little big size-wise, apparently attracts bears"
3,Wolves decry the crass commicialism of our image,"As I wolf I am incensed at the commercialization of my image. It perpetuates the strong wild virile myth of wolves. I think I can speak for all wolves in the desecration of our sacred lunar ritual of howling at the moon. That someone would wear our faith as an adornment, it just make me want to rip their throats out and gorge myself on their naughty bits."
1,Don't be fooled!,"This shirt is a rip-off. You may be tempted by its promise of three wolves but don't be fooled! they're actually just three big dogs passed off as wolves. I was down at Joad's Bait & Tackle last week when my so-called ""friends"" pointed this out.Now I'm the laughing stock at that bait shop and have to buy all my worms at the Walmart two towns over. I would've returned the shirt, but I dribbled chew all over the front.TOTAL SCAM"
1,Buyer beware,"They SAY it's three wolves, but how do we know it's not the same wolf from three different angles? We cannot assume they'd be above airbrushing or the use of creative lighting just to save on wolves..."
5,Big Mistake,I gave this shirt to my 4 year old nephew - big mistake! He started getting so much action he was kicked out of pre-school. The FDA or someone should crack down on a shirt this powerful.
2,Wolf look better than sound.,Sasquatch know these wolf. These wolf always howl not in tune. Buy shirt with wolf that in tune when howl instead.
4,"Believe it or not, this could be better","Believe it or not, this shirt is not perfect!It could be improved by making it out of kevlar to be projectile and knife resistant. Then the police could wear it under their uniforms and avoid looking so fat all the time.The other improvement would be to have the lyrics of the Klingon Fight Song ( in Klingon of course) on the back of the shirt. Otherwise , this is the perfect shirt.PS offer it in long sleeves also to protect the arms from slashings."
1,Disapointed!,"Mine had 3 cats playing with a ball of yarn on it. It has brought me crippling depression, I got fired and now have diabetes. If I had a girlfriend she'd probably have left me too!I have since burned the shirt, buried the shirt, donated the shirt, ate the shirt and several other tactics to rid my self of this bane only to have it reappear on my persons.I have contacted customer service about my problem and they recommended the sweet release of death."
3,kids shirt is not full size design,"the shirt is nice quality, but it was not a full sized design, i thought the wolves would be larger, they are centered and small in the middle, i ordered the kid's shirt"
1,Be Ye Warned!,"I don't actually own this shirt, but I'm pretty sure the guy who sorts through my recycling looking for returnables does. And his story is a sad one. Well, I don't really know what his story is, but I digress.The other reviewers say this shirt will bring you fame, fortune, and women by the scores. And it will. For a while. But I liken the powers of this shirt to those of winning the lottery; at first you seem to have it all, and everyone wants a piece. And they will get their piece, but soon there will be nothing left. You will be broke. Destitute. Depressed. Alone.You can continue to cruise the WalMarts, the county fairs, the truck stops, looking for some action. But the shirt's powers will have all ready moved on the some other poor, unassuming soul. This shirt will ruin your life. Buyer beware."
2,be careful,"This shirt is so powerful, that by putting it on, I've made it impossible to stop sexing myself up. It's also made chicks who I know are only into dudes come tearing after me, desperate for a piece of my wolf-clad self.Women beware - buying this shirt might have undesirable consequences."
1,Shirt did not last after 1 wash,"Washed the shirt for the first time, the wolves bled thru the back side of the shirt. Disappointed in the fact that the shirt did not even last 1 wash."
1,majorly disappointed,"one star, I WANTED four wolves and a moon, I had to settle on three, and its just not the same (sigh)"
1,disappointed,"I bought this shirt, bc i read all the good things.. Have been wearing it for a week, everyday.... Still nothing.. what am I doing wrong? I see it working for everyone else..."
5,3 Wolf Moon + Wife = Decadad,"I bought my wife this shirt 1 and 1/2 months ago and it made our love ravenous again, much like three wolves under a full moon.In other news, she is also pregnant with dectuplets.There is likely a connection. 5 Stars."
3,Beware - may be used for ill gain,"This product is dangerous in the wrong hands.My hubby and I decided we didn't want to have children, so I got my tubes tied and he got himself snipped over five years ago.My mother-in-law (from hell) was hell-bent (told ya) on having grandchildren, so she bought my hubby and I matching 3W1M t-shirts last week.Well, you read the reviews, I don't have to go into detail, but suffice it to say, I'm already 3 months pregnant...with triplets...all male.Beware mothers-in-law bearing 3W1M gifts."
5,Feel the power,"There is an idea so fragile that to utter it could destroy it. It is a hope and a dream held in the hearts and minds of all men. More precious than gold, we all cherish it at a deep, subconscious level. And yet, for most of the vast span of human history this aspiration has been denied physical existence because of its sheer overwhelming magnitude. Now, in t-shirt form, it has been born."
5,LAME!!,YOU GUYS HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THE HELL YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT!!! MAKING FUN OF WOLVES IS LAME AND DISRESPECTFUL. THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFULEST ANIMAL ON EARTH. GET A LIFE AND GET A REALITY CHECK! WITHOUT WOLVES WE ARE NOTHING!!!
1,Not good quality tshirt,"Color is not even on the textile, its not even black but dark green and quality of color is not evenly applied. Cotton is also low quality"
1,disappointed,"I am so disappointed when open the box. The material is so bad and the shirt is not even black, dye is all over. I don't think I can wear clothes using such a bad material."
1,..Am I doing this thing right?,*Clears throat* Ok...LAIK AMIGAWD WHEN I FIRST PUT ON THIS SHIRT I WON TEH LOTTERY DEN GOT FREE PIZZA FAW LIFE DEN I GOT ALL LIEK SUCSESSFUL WIT TEH WIMMINZ I NEVER TAKE THIS THING OFF LAWLZ CHUCK NORRIS CAME TO MY HAOUS TA CONGRATULATE ME CUZ I BR KEWL NAO JOIN THE PACK IT GOES GREAT WITH WHOLE MILK LAWLZ XD!!!!!!!
1,"This shirt is ugly and stupid, why all the positive reviews?","This shirt is for losers who think they're cool by wearing animals. Honestly, how silly are goths? they're so weird, they like wolves.ooh i'm a werewolf so i'm coooooool; NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTTT!by the way, I'm british, and like most British people, I like to kill jokes. I just killed my own joke, by admitting I'm british."
1,How stupid can people be?,...to believe in nonsense like this? Wow there really must be a lot of truly pathetic fools out there for a market for idiocy like this to exist.Also Amazon needs to improve it's blocking of pay-per-review services............
2,"Beware, Magical Wolves","I wish I could give this shirt a better rating but the wolves are so magical two of them came to life, attached my dog and ran away. Now I only have one wolf left and I was forced to have my shirt destroyed by a local Apache tribe in fear of what may come!"
5,Wolves beat Chuck Norris,"This shirt is so awesome that if I was walking down a dark alley and Chuck Norris was there, he would start running in the opposite direction because he knows that his superpowers are no match for the sacred howling wolf trinity.[...]"
5,Career Glam,"I recently started a new postiton in the hospitality indusrt. The job specifications said business casual as appropriate attire. Since I didn't know anyone there, I felt like this shirt was most appropriate for making new friends and at the same time showcasing my talents and desires. I love my wolf shirt. Whether it's to work at a fortune 500 company, the beach or a casual day of shopping, this shirt is not only suiting but the talk of everyone around. I met my husband while wearing this shirt and have not taken it off since."
5,Three Wolf Moon,"So I was sitting on my porch the other day wearing my brand-new Three Wolf Moon shirt and drinking the gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk that I received in the mail when the strangest thing happened. Eva Mendes and Jessica Biel came running up to my porch in their skimpy bikinis. They were holding a large duffel bag. They opened it to reveal 350 million dollars in straight cash. They then grabbed me and took me upstairs to my room. We all stripped naked (I kept my Three Wolf Moon shirt on though) and well, you can figure out what happened after that.Three Wolf Moon. It works. Take it from me, I have experienced its amazing effects. Ever since I first donned this t-shirt, my life has never been the same.Buy it. Matter fact, buy two or three. You will not be disappointed."
5,Mystic powers,"The effects of this magical tshirt is still arcane yet awesome. I bought this tshirt after reading some amazing reviews. I tracked down my package through UPS as soon as I got up at 11, still in my mattress next to boxes of stale pizzas. After playing WoW for several hours, I heard the UPS truck. At that moment, my spidey senses detected a huge quantity of estrogen. Upon peeking out of the window, I saw throngs of drooling women mindlessly following my Three Wolf tshirt. As soon as I tore open the package and tried the attire on, the effect was phenomenal. The women lost total control of themselves and nearly broke my front door off. They became ravenous, as my Three Wolf tshirt did its job. All women within a 50 mile radius came to my front door as if I became a new black hole.I should definitely wear this when I visit my cousin at Wellesley."
1,Missing one Wolf,"I was so disappointed when I received my T-Shirt and it only had two wolves and a moon. I mean, the description clearly said Three Wolves and a Moon. So where is the third Wolf? Is he out campaigning for the Tea Party or something? Was he the victim of a Rendition for dubious behavior? I do hope he is not facing the water board, oh dear. Anyway, I can't wear this shirt now! Everyone I know has three wolves on their shirt and I only have two, they'll all laugh at me It might as well not have the moon too. You can't have two wolves and a moon; that's just wrong. I mean, C'mon!"
3,Be careful of false advertising,"After reading several reviews, I purchased the tri-lupin t-shirt. I was immediately impressed with the design, which kicks way much ass, but also with the quality of the material and construction.Unfortunately that is where the impressiveness of the shirt stopped.I was unable to garner the attentions of any women when wearing it (no matter how many teeth), even around the dumpsters behind my Wal-Mart.I will say that my son, who was also born without bones, *did* grow a full skeleton (when I put the shirt on him), but the rest of the claims seem exaggerated."
1,Ted Nugent shot me!,"Be careful with this shirt. I decided to wear it to a Ted Nugent concert... You know, looking for a little ""cat scratch fever"" in this studly shirt. Half way through his set during his wild hunter portion that sob shot me with a flamming arrow! He saw those wolves and his 2nd Amendment Rights just took over! Be careful!"
1,Too expensive.. should be cheaper,"I'm just being a hater because at $16.49 it's a bit pricey and not all us folks can afford such expensive threads. But then again, you pay for what you get so I guess it is worth not eating lunch for a week to sport this awesome shirt. I'm trying to sell my burberry scarf and LV wallet just so I can get a few of these bad boys. Can't wait until that day comes so I can finally score with super models!"
1,The locks have been changed,"This shirt ruined my life!I bought it two months ago, not from Amazon, but from a small aged wise Japanese chap who owned a curiosity store in Lower Manhattan.My mother and girlfriend fell in love with the t-shirt immediately. The three of them began to have a special relationship that i am no longer part of.I wait outside restaurants to try and see my (now ex) girlfriend leaving with the wolves, but she and the hairy no good scoundrels blank me.I moved back in with my mother, but she has shunned me. I've been dis-owned, and she changed the locks last night. When i call she laughs and i can hear the howls in the background.I now live in the park."
5,"Dreams can come true for you, too...","(Scott reviewing...) As a performer and musician, I had been disillusioned as to the amount of female anatomy presented to me while on stage. I had assumed that ""being flashed"" was one of the perks of the job. Apparently, my shakras were out of whack, making women enjoy my crooning but not show the goods. My sister, who is an Angel, gifted me this potent talisman of raw power, lining those energy centers right up at maximum harmonic output. The sheer amount of va-jay-jay and boobies I've seen at my shows is staggering since donning this magic apparel.I highly recommend the aquisition of this shirt to anyone..."
4,"AWESOME, but needs more options.","A few months back, I was busted for public intoxication at an outdoor REO Speedwagon concert. Luckily I was wearing this shirt on my court date, and the judge went easy - I got off with community service. I figure this shirt is lucky, and wear it every chance I get. The black color perfectly constrasts the orange reflective vest I have to wear, and I know the increased visibility saves my butt from being run over when picking up road-side trash for my service hours. My only complaint is that the shirt is too hot. The sleeves don't let chicks see my bigass [...] guns and Oklahoma flag tattoo. I wanted to cut the sleeves off, but a man just doesn't do that to his lucky shirt. I'd 100% buy a tank top of this shirt if they made one. It'd be much cooler, and it would proudly expose the manly unshorn chest & back hair I've been blessed with. People would wonder where the wolf ends, and the man starts if I had a tank top!"
1,Is it possible?,"I have ascended. All three wolf moon t-shirt wearers shall bow before me when I appear before you wearing my The Official Three Wolf Moon Pajamas 3 Wolf Moon Footed Pjs with Drop Seat. It could not last, mortals!"
5,Howlingly Handsome!!,"My cousin was recently married, and with the regular hustle and bustle of life I had little time to go out and shop for an outfit. As the day approached and the pressure built my wife suggested I check amazon.com rather than my usual haberdashery. I'd used them in the past and am still very satisfied with the foam dome I purchased last year. So I searched and searched when finally I came across this marvel! They say it's uncouth to out dress the groom at his own wedding, but wearing this it was unavoidable -- even with the holes in my sweatpants!!During the reception I bit into a bratwurst and was horrified as some of the grease squirted out and onto my shirt. Horrified until I saw the way that the grease made the already beautiful moon even more iridescent!! Those wolves really had a reason to howl! And so do I!! For my wolf shirt!!! Thank you, Internet!!!!"
2,Caution - Do not use as sleepwear.,"My 97 year old aunt got me this shirt for Arbor day (she's really tech-savvy and managed to beat Halo 3 on Legendary with one arm!), but seeing that it was an ""aunt gift"" I thought I'd rather not be seen in public with a shirt my aunt got me.So I wore it as a pajama shirt. BIG MISTAKE.Once I fell asleep, my body became a vessel to Urk On'landen, a demon of the Netherwolrds sealed within the threads of the shirt. The Dark Unwashed one used my sleeping form as a host to commit outrageous acts, some of which I do not fully remember. I do know he traveled back in time and fathered PeeWee Herman.My point is, if you wake up and find that someone stole your mailbox or filled in the crossword puzzle in your morning paper, that's probably me. I'm sorry."
5,2 Pounds of awesome,"I can't help but notice that the shipping weight of this single tee shirt is a hefty two pounds. As a result, I have to assume that this item ships with a fiery wolf turd packed neatly into the cardboard frame which, undoubtedly, can scarcely contain the phoenix-like wolf droppings. I've placed mine on order and anxiously await both the tee and the pooed-out remains of an unfortunate wolf enemy."
5,Three Wolf Wardrobe,"After I got my first Three Wolf Moon shirt, I realized that the rest of my wardrobe was frankly unworthy of being in its presence. And so I bought 10 more shirts with the intention of making a matching outfit consisting of the original t-shirt, a vest, a pair of shorts, and a stylish kerchief. Stupidly I prepared my scissors and attempted to cut through the first t-shirt, only to realize that try as I might, I could not rend that glorious fabric. No one can, as no one should. I was foolish to think otherwise, or even to consider the idea. As I write this, my scissors lie in a tangle of twisted metal at my feet.I can only hope that the shamans who created the Three Wolf Moon t-shirt will take my story into account and work their magic once more so that I can possess the matching outfit I so desire."
2,Disappointment in the Wolf Tee-shirt,"I was extremely upset with the wolf tee-shirt. I entered a wet tee-shirt contest, and I wanted both of my nipples to make a statement. I am a B cup, so one of my nips successfully came out of the moon. However, my other nipple--which I was told would come directly out of the wolf's eye--failed miserably. Instead, my nipple--which is noticably lower than my left nipple--came out of his mouth. WTF? False advertising."
5,simply awesome...,"Thanks to this shirt, my penis has grown an extra 2 inches. Now the ladies cant get enough of my 4 inches of man meat. Thanks Three Wolf Moon T-Shirt!"
5,This is the One!,"If you only buy one wolf t-shirt this year, this is the one! Do not buy two of this shirt. No one can handle what may happen."
1,Trick Me,"I from Russia and not read title. I feel rip off. I thought it was 3 Dog, Cheese Pizza shirt. Waste of money. Who want wolve and moon? 3 Dog Cheese Pizza look better."
1,Not so great,"After reading the reviews for the shirt, i knew i had to unlock the powers within me. I chose the 1 day shipping (as i'm not so rich to choose the yesterday shipping option.) As it arrived, it leaped out of the package, bit the delivery guy and attached to me on a molecular level. The powers i've recieved aren't as impressive as i thought. I kill all the women i mate with with the power waves of my hips, (but they do make good post-bone snacks.) Girl scouts won't sell me cookies, lest that another tornado hits and takes their troop away like the last one that tried. I can't even get into my trailer without ripping of my door! I know it instantly mends itself using the golden thread of the Fates and every time i rip it off an evil badger dies, but it is slightly annoying. Sometimes i wonder if it was the right choice to get this. My family is afraid to say anything, but i know exactly what they are thinking. Darn psychic powers."
3,Not Just For Men!!!!,"I saw this shirt hyped on a link through yahoo. My curiousity got the best of me as I clicked on the link and read all these reviews on the shirt. Most from men, I figured I would throw caution to the wind and buy one, as women, should be able to harness the power as well!! The shirt arrived as promised, however a little smaller than I had hoped for it being an XL. However, I can describe it as being ""sexy"" and ""seductive"" to wear. A little tight, it looks more of a babydoll shirt than anything. I have yet to see the ""magical benefits"" that is being touted here on the reviews however, time will tell......."
1,This shirt is gender-bending,"When I bought this shirt, I was a sexy, curvaceous female. I was very feminine, the kind of girl who loved ruffles, pink high heels and collected Precious Moments statues. I thought it would be fun to wear this cute tee. A bad mistake. First, I noticed dark, thick hair sprouting on my chin. I went to my beauty shop but there wasn't enough wax in the world to keep this beard from crawling over my face. My biceps started bulging like miniature mountain wolves themselves. I found I needed to go to the bathroom standing up, rather awkward in the corporate ladies room because I kept leaving the seat up. Then, I awoke one morning from uneasy dreams of wolves howling at the moon and found myself transformed in my bed into a monstrous MAN. But not just any man, a testosterone-drenched sex symbol stalked by hungry, sex-crazed hussies. Since deep in my psyche I'm still a heterosexual female, this sickens me. Take your shirt back! Return my estrogen to me!"
3,These dogs won't leave my mind alone.,"They keep barking at the moon and arguing with me and each other and the two males keep fighting over the one in heat. I think she really wants me, the way she keeps writhing on her back for my benefit. But It benifits me none, I don't do dogs. Well, there was that one time, but she would've looked better if her eyes had been level to one another, instead of one slightly higher and looking to the left. But anyway, I put the shirt on the bottom of the pile in my shirt drawer, but they still keep talking and barking, it's only muffled, that's all. I don't know what I'm going to do, I really need my sleep so I can be freshly rested when Jesus comes."
1,No super powers.,"This shirt is a nice looking short, but it comes with no superpowers. I think mine is broken. Oh well, at least it looks pretty cool."
5,FOUND A THREE WOLF MOON NECKLACE,"AWESOME SHIRT - LOVE THE DESIGN , HAD A THREE WOLF MOON NECKLACE MADE CUSTOM ON EBAY. TOTALLY COOL. CAN'T WAIT TO RECEIVE IT. MAGICAL POWERS OR NOT !!!!"
2,Blood chemistry incompatibility?,"I have a rare blood condition: the oxy-aldone count in my hemoglobin is quadruple that in normal men. Consequently, I tend to be far more masculine and territorial than most. However, every time I wear this shirt, I tell everyone that I look ""fabulous"" and want to ""go shopping"". I'm guessing there is some rare chemical agent in the fabric that neutralizes the aldones."
5,The 3 Wolf Moon T-Shirt,Good quality material and graphics. First of two purchased and both have vibrant color and great detail. Definitely am going to buy more.
1,This shirt gave me diabetes...,"I bought 16 of these shirts expecting to be swarmed by super models and celebrities, but instead I got diabetes...And not just diabetes SUPERdiabetes...These reviews are bloody awful and full of lies! Nobody ever climbed mount everest with this wreteched diabetes shirt!!!!!And on top of that my girlfriend (now ex) went blind apon seeing this evil shirt! She then promptly broke up with me after I tried to explain that the wolves would bring us money and fame...THIS SHIRT IS A LIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Don't believe the hype,"I am very skeptical about this product. There are lots of glowing reviews here on Amazon claiming that it endows the wearer with special powers -- sexual, magical, and otherwise. But I can't tell you how many pills I've bought over the Internet that make the same claim, and have been disappointed in, over and over. Seriously, at best you get a slight itchy feeling from them, at worst ... well, without going into details that I'm legally unable to share due to a court order, let's just say they've put a damper on my romantic activities, solo or otherwise.So while I don't actually own this item, I just wanted to warn other customers who might buy the T-shirt based on these reviews ... beware. Not everything sold on the Internet is what it's claimed to be. I learned this the hard way, many many times.I'll probably buy the T-shirt anyway, just for the rocking picture though. That alone is worth the price."
4,Powers only work when I think happily,"So, when wearing this shirt, I noticed that I immediately received all powers of the planeteers, superspeed, invisibility, flight, and the ability to turn woodchucks into gold.The problem is the powers only occur when I think about happy thoughts. I later found out that Peter Pan made the shirt so it makes a lot of sense. I think that the manufacturer would specify this.-1 star cause it fades easily in the wash."
2,I don't understand.,"I would have to disagree with the previous 270 (or so) reviewers. I bought this shirt, and expedited shipping because of the rave reviews and I had our annual toll-booth operators picnic, but really I don't see what the hub-bub is about. OK, the illustration is nothing short of a masterpiece, but it didn't fit so well, and after 2 washes one of the wolves started to fade. I didn't not pay $30 for a 2 wolf shirt!Perhaps that is some of the magical power that some reviewers have referred to, but I just haven't seen it yet."
5,Thrilling!,"Yes, it's fast. No, the way the alap unfolds is not going to be to everyone's taste. But this recording is astonishing, brilliant, extraordinary. Pure energy from beginning to end."
5,big hit!,"This was a big hit for my 4 yr old! Its the most played with toy he got for christmas. I think its durable and the action figures are a good size for his age, unlike the other castle he got where the figures are quite small. It takes a little bit to get used to how the figures work with the electronic chips but we are all having a great time with it now!"
5,21 yr old Masters Collector,"This toy is wonderful, although nothing could live up to it's slightly older brother. The character recognition is a supreme display of the creativity and imagination that mattel has to offer. To the parents of the children who seem to be having problems with the toy: First of all please look at the age grouping. 2nd, this toy has lasted me and many of my friends messing around with it since summer of '02. It should have lasted your child way more than one day. Maybe that child should learn to respect what he has and not be so careless."
1,"I agree, an expensive disappointment","My son also got this gift from Santa this year and was very excited to see it as he wanted it very badly. However, the thing is very cheaply made. The doors don't open more often than not and the trap door never opens without help. The jail constantly falls apart. My son tried to play with it throughout the day on Christmas and got so frustrated that it just sits in his room now."
2,Below Average,"This book was pretty disappointing. I was hoping for something with a little more meat on it. Its a deceptive 160 odd pages. The book is small, almost like a pocket book, and it reads super fast because there are pictures on almost every other page. It felt like you really only get a taste of what a humanitarian and enviromental disaster ship breaking in Bangladesh and India really are. It reads almost as if it is a ""day in the life"" book, mainly because it focuses on the dismantlement of one particular ship. I think this book is less about ship breaking than it is an obituary for the Asian Tiger oil tanker. Get it from the Library if you're really interested, don't waste your 15 bucks on this."
1,"Batteries dead within 40 hours of use-->Batteries replaced promptly by seller, but also failed very quickly",original post: I typically replace the batteries in my 2 Presario 3000 laptops every 12-18 months when their charged lifetime reaches approximately 15 minutes.The batteries I am discussing per this review only lasted about 40 hours before failing to hold any charge at all.update: The seller provided an RMA and replaced the batteries very promptly but the 2nd set of replacement batteries has failed within 40 hours as well.
2,Only buy if you just need a battery to sell the computer,"Bought in March, by June it's randomly going into discharge. Stays that way until computer shuts down, then starts to charge again. Now it charges only to 91% and the charge light stays on all the time, until it decides to go into discharge again. Save your pennies and buy a decent battery. Given its low quality, I have to wonder if it's going to decide to explode."
2,Not really about apparitions,"This book is really just a rehash of protestant fundamentalist objections to Catholic views of Mary. It is only incidently about apparitions. In fact, Kauffman concedes without discussion that the apparitions are supernatural (!) but assumes they must be demonic since they are reported to say things that sound Catholic. He complains that the apparitions have not been subject to the testing of spirits described in 1 John, but he gives no exegesis of that passage to justify its being applied to situations its author could hardly have had in mind. I wish Kauffman would have given more credit to the Church which has placed apparitions under careful scrutiny and rejected most. I enjoyed Kauffman's personal story of growing up Catholic and having a shallow magical form of Marian devotion. It should serve as a reminder that we need to teach our children well. Otherwise they will be vulnerable to shallow seductive teachings -- including protestant fundamentalism."
5,Chobits The Series,This series was the best one of Clamp I have ever read. It really sent chills down my spine.It really kept you hooked on each and every page.So thats why I went out and bought the whole series.
4,A good quality saw for the money,"This is a good saw for the money. I took the time when I first set it up to carefully level the extension table with the main table and to square the fence with the blade. I made several cuts with it during the process and checked each cut with an engineers square until everything was good. Contrary to what others have written, the laser does work. The switch for the laser has a synthetic removeable cover to keep the dust out. This makes the switch a little tricky to use at first but after using it a few times you learn where to press on it and it works fine."
3,Laser problems,Laser switch didn't always work at first. Better lately. Now the laser line for the right side of the kerf is half as bright as the left laser line. Or less. I tried blowing the sawdust away. No effect. I am a little disappointed. It also seems like the aux fence doesn't want to align properly with the main table.Fudge. I thought Porter-Cable was a good brand. Now I wonder.
3,Shop hard for price,"I found this 3700L (10 inch) in Costco stores last week for $149 to $179. I was really looking for a 12"" saw as my first Miter saw, but for $149, I figured I couldn't lose- so I bought the 3700L- So, check price carefully, and also note that there are lots of RECONDITIONED 3700L units on the market. I trust they are properly labeled. I can't wait to set up and try this saw!"
2,THE LASER DOES NOT WORK,The laser does not work. I bought this miter saw at home depot. The laser would work once in a while and now it is completely dead. This seems to be a common theme. Overall the miter saw itself is solid and the idea behind twin lasers is good but if it does work what is the point. Others who have criticized this product have similar issues. No wonder this item is being discontinued at home depot.
1,A Terrible Text,"This is a required text for Bussiness Analysis and Valuation at the University of Western Australia, so unfortunately I had to read it.This book explains everything in a very long winded, round about way, making simple ideas difficult to comprehend. There are no key points that are highlighted seperate from the main body of witing, making revision tedious. The exercises at the back of this book often miss out vital parts of the question, or have errors, making them impossible to do with out the solutions, that do not come with book.If possible I would highly recommend that you avoid this book."
2,Not a great fit and too hard to adjust,I purchased two of these for my twin girls and they look cheap and fit poorly. They are also hard to adjust. My girls like wearing the helmets but they do not fit properly. I wish I could send them back as I now need to purchase something else.
1,Disappointed,"I bought this software to help clean up my computer and I can't even get it to run half the features. It just locks up, no errors or anything. I don't even have that problem with my other programs."
2,Leigh--ugh!,"Extraordinarily gifted as she is, Jennifer Jason Leigh gives a horribly mannered performance as the lesser half of a sister tandem. She ruins the picture with studied tics. Playing the title role of Georgia, the successful singer in the family, Amy Madigan is so much better than Leigh. Hers is a quiet, intelligent performance which deservedly got an Oscar nomination. Leigh fooled the New York film critics who gave her their top accolade as Best Actress! Yuck!"
1,"Tedious film, Leigh's character is awful","I did not like this movie at all. It was tedious getting through the entire film. I am a fan of Jennifer Jason Leigh, but the character she was portraying was awful. I kept hoping it would get better, that Leigh's character, Sadie, would redeem herself, but she never did. She seems to have no positive attributes. Sadie is an alcoholic drug addict who uses people and has no talent. A curious thing about the film was that with each performance, the entire song was shown/played. This was fine during Georgia's (Mare Winningham) performances as the songs were pleasant, but this was absolutely terrible and unbearable during Sadie's performances. Especially when she does a cover of a Van Morrison song, which must have close to 10 minutes long. This movie does not seem to have a plot, but instead simply shows a part of each of the sister's lives."
1,So bad I turned it off halfway through!,"I tried to watch this poor excuse for a film for about an hour. Who cares about a drunk, would-be singer in a movie with absolutely no plot and not the least bit of suspense. I only rented it because critics had raved about it (I should have known better--many times I've regretted renting a movie for that reason). Would definitely NOT recommend this to anyone."
3,A realistic tale of sorrow,"Very good performances on a story that is quite depressing and will make you wonder about some loose ends. We never get a clear message on why Sadie becomes so obsessed in becoming a singer under the shadow of her famous sister. We never get to know what happens to her husband who supposedly did not walk out on her. I read the critics review, but like many, I do not agree with them. Definitely not a boring movie, but neither entertaining nor educational."
1,"Not Funny, not humorous","Wow, what a waste of time. Humor, of course, is a matter of individual taste but these are NOT funny stories. Most were not, in my opinion, intended as humorous by the authors- off beat, quirky and interesting, perhaps, but NOT humorous. Even the selections from the true humor writers are the least funny, from my experience of their other works. Very sorry that I wasted my time and money on the book."
5,for your pleasure,"Yo tommy boy records your losing money on this! Bring back the usa maxi single version with all the plus mixes. I love the ripe and juicy mix, and the cover."
3,Highs and lows,"This is a ""Best in Show"" kind of mockumentary that suffers from overkill at its worst moments. This is particularly true of interviews with go go boy contestants that go too long (and over the top) in playing up their eccentricity. The contestants work too hard at trying to be odd, particularly the ballet dancer who wants to be a stripper. On the plus side, I thought Hedda Lettuce had some pretty funny lines. You can tell she's spent many a night entertaining a live audience. This is a renter, not a keeper, unless super silly is to your taste."
2,Not good for Spanish students,I bought this to watch in my Spanish class and ended up sending it back. The audio track is not of great quality and the voice is hard to understand. There also seems to be very little rhyme or reason to how the information is presented. I found the Globe Trekker movie to be a much better way of teaching my students about Chile and its culture.
2,I wish I didn't love this book,"Throat Sprockets is the most poorly written book I have ever loved. Lucas has no feel for the English language. It is no wonder that this is his only novel. His over use of film terminology and trivia grates on my nerves even though I studied film myself and am thus familiar with the words.So, why have I read the darn thing twice??"
4,"Indepth look at ""Total Soccer""","What can be said about Rinus Michels that hasn't already been said about the creator of 'Total Soccer'. Having said that I can only give this book four stars due to Mr. Michels' ramblings sometimes. Yes, it is a somewhat difficult book to read. My advice is to get you a notepad and pen to write down the many golden gems found in this book.Half-way through the book I realized that I was reading the thoughts of a genius. Section after section I found the answers to some of my questions I had regarding the tactics, training, and methods of professional teams (some applicable up to the U12 level.) I have no doubts that the reader's coaching methods will be positively affected due to the knowledge that Mr. Michels shares in this book."
1,Still dont know what it was about,This book is way to complicated and doesnt really do anything to get to success. It is all about high levels of soccer and nothing the normal coach can related to.
4,Great for making new doors look old!,"Met my expectations and I loved the price. Used these along with mortise trim plates and tubular latch kits to replace various mismatched doorknobs in our 100 year old home. Very easy to install, the only draw back was the loss of the ability to lock the doors. Overall I like the cleaner look that matches our home's age."
3,Early Bogguss,"I'm a huge fan of all of Suzy's work, but this is mainly slow, almost traditional country style and her weakest release, thus no hits off this one I believe. Even her weakest is very entertaining though. Worth the $2!"
4,A minor classic,"This early Jools Holland album, whilst not as good as his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra albums, is well worth getting. The best known track on this album is ""Bird Cage Walk"" which is the theme to the 'Later..."" TV shows.The genesis of the Rhythm and Blues Orchestra can be heard on the 2nd track ""Newgates Knocker"". Boogie Piano, Hammond Organ, a big brass section and burning guitar from his regular guitarist Mark Flanagan. Indeed ""High Street"" is on the live Rhythm and Blues Orchestra album. Rotton Row Boogie is classic boogie Woogie given Jools distinctive flourishes with Gilson providing a rocking backing.Inside the sleeve notes there is a reference section where Jools lists the many great Pianists that influenced the recording of this album. So once you've bought all of Jools albums you can start buying all of these great artists. As he listed another 43 Pianists this should keep you occupied for the rest of your life!"
1,Not up to this excellent pianist's standard,"If you have listened to ""Sex and Jazz and Rock and Roll"" and ""Lift The Lid"", you'll know what great sounds Jools Holland (and his Rhythm & Blues Orchestra)can make. This album is the exception. It's a case of the A-Z of London cliches meets Chas and Dave. Pity"
5,Not Bad At All!,"The best thing Jools has got going for himself is the singer SAM BROWN who sings on all his albums. Sam Browm has not been heard of in a long time till she dueted with the brilliant FISH on the hit single called JUST GOOD FRIENDS from his album YIN. While she could of capitalised on this publicity she instead decided to hang in the shadow of Jools Holland. This is a great shame as she has a magnificent voice. Perhaps she'll get back with FISH after he finishes promoting RAINGODS WITH ZIPPOS, we'll see."
1,save your money - find something else,The amazon web site indicates this will work with newer versions of Win but it does NOT work with Win 7 - which is all there is now a days. The web site does not indicatre that now - how odd is that. We wasted money because we only havec WIN 7 and now our lkittle child has NOTHING and we have useless software. Do NOT buy this if you have a new laptop or computer.
4,"Great looking bass, lighter than expected.","This bass arrived 2.5 days after i actually ordered it. Super fast delivery and free !I was disappointed by the fact that it is made in China. It looks great but feels like the assembly is a bit weak. The bass feels light like it has no body at all, and lots of buzzing notes (probably needs a tune-up by a pro).Other than that, when you pay 299.00, there really is nothing to complain about seeing that for an extra 50 bucks you can get a made in mexico fender which doesn't come close to this epi in sound breadth.."
3,Not Bad - Just Awkward,"I bought this bass as a backup to my '82 Ibanez Roadstar II. Out of the box, the intonation was perfect and it has a smooth, playable neck. It is much heavier than my Ibanez and has a larger and longer neck that will take getting used to. The neck reminds me of a J-bass neck. My first ever bass was a P-bass in 1975. This Thunderbird is just as heavy if not more so than that was. The bass has great low tone when playing through my GK MB115, and great highs as well. My major problems with it are the unbalanced feel that can probably be fixed by different strap placement, which may void the warranty. Also, the beast has very little sustain - I will need to add an EQ or compressor/enhancer to get the sustain I want - experimentation time, it seems. Maybe I should just get the sound man to stop drowning out my bass with the kick drum in the mains..... I would not recommend this bass, but my preference is Ibanez, anyway."
1,Doesn't Work,"I've bought the two previous versions of this software (going back to when it was called Fix-It Utilities) and never had a problem. But now a new company, V-Com, has taken over the product, and their first revamp, version 5.0, doesn't work. At least, it would not install itself on my Windows XP system - I kept getting error messages saying that the program could not be activated. I had to uninstall it and return to v. 4.0. It's a typical example of a software product that worked fine until someone decided to ""improve"" it by adding so many bells and whistles that it ends up being incompatible with most people's PCs. Stick to v. 4.0 and save yourself money and headaches."
1,Worst customer support in the world.,"If you ever need help from this company, God help you! Because you won't get it from their customer support. They couldn't care less, once they have your money."
3,Good but dated- version 6 is now out,"This was a very good suite when released, but many of the tools are more useful for Windows 98 then XP. Version 6 was just released. From the email from V-Com, it appears more appropriate for XP. However, I'd wait for the reviews."
4,A MUST READ FOR ALL WOMEN & OLDER TEENS,"""The Gentlemen's Club had me laughing and crying, occasionally at the same time. This book made me think about the future of my daughters. There are so many issues in this book that need to be addressed. One is abuse; it is common, it can occur anywhere. The girls of today need to be protected, physically and emotionally. They need to be talked to and heard. We need to keep them on the right path, or too many of them will become a character in this novel. As the author says, women are strong and amazing and we need to support each other. We all need to read 'The Gentlemen's Club."""
4,Women Should Read This Book!,"""The Gentlemen's Club"" is geared towards women and intended to tackle the issue of abuse. It deals with all types of abuse such as molestation, incest, rape, sexual harassment as well as domestic violence. This book is quite raw and blunt in its delivery style. Angie is determined to no longer be a victim and take back control of her life. Overall, I thought this was an inspirational read but was troubled by the religion chapter."
4,A Story of Domestic Abuse and Overcoming It,"The Gentlemen's Club: A Story for All Women tells the story of Angie who tells her story of abuse. As we follow her throughout the book we are able to witness her become a stronger woman who starts to stand up for herself and helps others along the way. This is a great example of how women can help other women become stronger and find their own voices. The do not have to stay and become a statistic they are able to break the cycle and go on to have very accomplished and fulfilling lives on their own. Angie is able to help others get out of situations that are hurting them and realize that some of the places they choose to stay in are not safe and that they can always do better, they just need to stand up and make the decision that they deserve better and are capable of doing it. She becomes a hero for her friends."
4,Great Poetic Lyrics,"The best thing about the Promise Ring is their beautiful poetic lyrics. It is worth the price for the CD liner notes alone that contain them. It is too bad that the vocals are turned down so much, although filling in the ideas on your own and slowly discovering the words I guess can add to the emotional experience of the song. The music on this disc is strangely intense and mellow at the same time. It is the only emo I've purchased that makes good background music. The songs are whatever you want them to be, and open to wide interpretation because of the abstract lyrics. One final note- if you are interested in the emotional side of the Promise Ring, get this CD or The Horse Latitudes. Any of their music produced after this is repetitive pop/punk."
1,very disappointing,"this album is terrible. just useless noise. i also own electric pink and very emergency. if you liked those albums, you will agree that this one is garbage."
2,Promise Ring are way overrated.,"I must say, I heard about the Promise Ring through some emobuddies of mine and they said that they sound cool. They have a big reputation in the community but why? (probably because some of the bandmembers were in a cult band called Cap'N Jazz, who were much better than this) They write mediocre pop songs with embarrasing lyrics, boring music, and a VERY lame voice. He can't sing! They aren't charming either. A few songs are ok but most of them blow. If you're into emopop go for The Get Up Kids or Jimmy Eat World."
1,i felt cheated,"i bought this CD based on more than one recommendation and i have to say that i absolutely hated it. more than the money i wasted on this, i wasted time listening to it and that's time i'll never recover. if good emo is what you're looking for, look elsewhere. if tone deaf bleatings are what you're after, you've come to the right place."
2,more cheese from wisconsin,"doesn't the idea of guys over the age of 19 writing emo music seem ridiculous to anyone else? well it's become more than an idea; now, it's an industry. let's stop this worship of twenty-somethings who constantly remind us how much girls sucked in high school. if you must, buy squirrel bait"
3,I'm so confused,"Dude, can you like emo it up for me? Like, emo emo emo emo. Emo to emo emo the emo. Why can't we just rock? Must we emo still?I'm 2 years old and I listen to this because it's popular. It's like emo-tastic.I'm not emoing it, I'm just saying emo.Emo you! Not emo emo my emo with your emo!"
1,Barely worth one star.,"Worst band to ever come out of the hardcore scene and pretty much the death knell of melodic-hardcore in the 90s. After these soft Weezer wannabe charlatans it was all downhill. It's baffling how Jade Tree went from releasing the Swiz discography to putting out these guys.These guys are only notable for having a split 7"" with the far superior Texas Is The Reason. Buy the self titled Texas Is The Reason ep on Revelation instead and live your life in hapiness knowing you have the one truely great release which came outta that whole sub-scene."
4,Insightful look at roots of drag racing,"If you like drag racing, this book is a ""must have"" for your coffee table. It traces drag racing history from its main origin after WW II, to the first funny cars, and rear-engined dragsters. The only regret I have is that the story doesn't go into the modern-day machines and stars. Nevertheless, if you want to know who drove this exciting sport to the level it is today, and who the icons of the sport were (and still should be), buy this book."
2,doggies? get out.,"Death of a friend, breaking of a seal, final confrontation...here it comes, the final showdown!!!! Dogs? Ninja Dogs? Come on. After all that build up, you give us ninja dogs? It's like listening to a joke you know that's going to be good. You are sitting there waiting for the punchline, and you are ready to clutch your stomach because it's going to be a belly laugh. Then suddenly a clown in a cheap custom jumps out from behind the curtain and starts juggling balls; while the comedian takes a break. By the time he comes back and finish telling the joke, you can't get that cheap clown out of your mind. The joke fizzles, and you felt you got robbed.Am I going too far? Maybe. Masashi Kishimoto did an awesome job of setting up the story in Volumes 2 and 3. Volume 4 was going to be the climax, the punchline that makes you gasp for air. Enters the clown."
4,don't write it off just yet...,"Ok, so maybe this was a bit of an anticlimax following the huge cliff hanger at the end of volume three. However, loads of new characters are introduced in this volume which give rise to a whole new level of story telling and character development. There are currently 22 volumes of naruto waiting to be translated into English and this volume sets the stage for what is to come. It's a really good read, and if you can't wait for the next volume, there are plently that have been scanlated available on the net, so go check it out...it's definately worth it!"
3,book came in okay,great book came in at a alright condition nothing to really complain about definatley worth buying if you need it for part of your collection of naruto manga
1,Not the original RF shampoo,"I have been using this shampoo for years first in Europe, then in the US through Amazon. However, I was very surprised when I got my shampoo a couple of weeks ago from this seller in particular. The shampoo doesn't smell the same, the color of the actual shampoo is darker and the consistency is thinner than the original shampoo. I have no idea where this seller got the product from, however it is not an original RF shampoo. I am very disappointed and will not buy from the same seller again."
5,Fine hair healty boost!!,This shampoo is great for finehair with oilyscalp. It can bu used daily and will not dry hair out or outweight it. I am very happy with this product.
5,Good!!!!,"I Think This is very awesome Item. Because if use this Item that my hair is more smooth, good. so I love it"
5,Heart-breaking nostalgia,"gawd, it's been a decade since this was released. writing a review for this, my first english cassette ever, is like reliving my bitter-sweet growing up years. this album pretty much sums up the entire late-80's techno/dance era. a MUST-HAVE!"
5,CD is great and the music is very hot!,"The music is very hot. if you like techno music, then I recomend this CD. It is the best of the 80s and it make you feel really young.It also make you want to stand up and dance. It's too bad this group did not produce more CDs."
5,A classic..,"I ordered the Kindle version because I wanted to reread this classic book. I think everyone should read it, especially those interested in topics of social injustice, horrendous work conditions and just to read a classic you should have read in high school."
5,K & N Air filters,Absolutely hands down the best air filter out there on the market to my knowledge. These are a must have. Buy a K&N filter for anything you own that requires a filter. Save lots of money. Increase performance. Getcha one!
5,Excellent item,Easy to mount.Can see details from kilometers away - the colors of a small sized flag can be distinguished from 3 kilometers away and the details of an airplane from more than 5 Km.The moon can be seen in great detail - haven't tried other planets (not in the range of my windows).
4,Celestron Spotting Scope,"This is an excellent product for the money. The optics are clear & crisp. I use it for spotting on the rifle range but also use it for general star gazing and for looking at boats around the bay.It is made for table top use and the adjustments on the tripod to move it around are a necessity so as not to lose the focal point.If Celestron made this model that could be fitted to a taller free standing tripod and still retain the azimuthing features, I would rate it over 5 stars!It is very compact and light weight and sets up in minutes."
3,Beautiful Shoes But...,"These shoes are well made, the leather is beautiful, and the color great. I returned them immediately. Unfortunately, they have a mock toe which isn't as clear in the images or description as I would have liked. I have size 11 feet, and these shoes extended another 2"" beyond the end of my foot in the toe box. Very trendy, I guess, but my wife said they looked like clown shoes. I will probably exchange them for another style of Kenneth Cole, since I was generally happy with the shoe."
1,paperthin soles,"have the black and brown pairs. i do walk heavy, however, in little under 2 years, i wore holes through the soles of these shoes - both pairs!!!"
4,14 hits in 9 years isn't too bad.,"The problem with ""greatest hits"" albums is that the desire to include a certain number of ""hits"" means you get the so-so singles along with the big successes. This is a good album when you just want a Duran Duran snack but don't want to think too much. Just fun, popular, and mostly danceable music."
3,missing out,"While including most of their earlier hit singles, this album misses out on what made Duran so good, their artfull, well crafted and poetic album tracks, and even some of their best singles. Pop fizz is here but not the involving depth of songs like the Chauffeur, the Seventh Stranger, New Religion and Sound of Thunder. If you don't have any Duran albums and would like to check them out, start with a proper album like Rio, and don't get the wrong idea about them."
4,A Recommended Greatest Hits,"I've had this compilation ever since it came out several years ago, and think that it's well worth the money spent. Duran Duran created some great music during the '80s. Recommended."
5,LONG LIVE THE ORIGINAL FAB FIVE!,"My best friend gave me the cd as a christmas present and I religiously play it whenever I clean. I hate cleaning so I really need some inspiration! The music brings me back to the simple life of big hair/multiple colored hair, too much makeup, neon clothes, leg warmers, head bands, wearing socks with your shoes, michael jackson's face before his 878th plastic surgery and when mtv had little talk and all music. It's great to feel 14/15 again at least a couple times a month! I really miss the three taylors because they all contributed their own style to the music. I see this cd as a tribute to the REAL DURAN DURAN!"
3,Not what I was looking for.,Had good pictures and interesting text. But it wasn't what I was looking for. I wanted more of a how-to with patterns and such. And so this book did not meet my needs.
2,It's an IDEA book!,"Don't go looking for much in the way of instructions here. However, you will find lots of inspiration to make some Cindy Lauper-like creations (or maybe you'll be expressing your own inner rock-star-image!) by cutting up wool sweaters washed in the hot cycle so that the felted fabric can more easily be cut, sewn and embellished.There is a potential here for some wonderful projects that will absolutely scream ""YOU!"" I love the fact that the models are not... well... models. They are average folk and that adds to the charm of the book.Even though Second-Time Cool: The Art of Chopping Up a Sweater is a very thin book, there are lots of ideas that can be generated if you are the kind of person who can be inspired by visual cues to imagine your own creation."
5,So Much Better Than Described!,"I ordered this book because it looked interesting....well, it is! It is a wonderful idea book. It gives minimal instructions for creating garments out of found clothing (sweaters), but it is jam-packed with the neatest ideas and everything is doable with minimum skills. What is especially nice is that the photographs, writers, models are not from the U.S. It is always nice to really get a look into the style of people from different countries. Excellent book and ""search"" offered by amazon does not highlight the best parts. Do not go by the minimal pages that are offered as a sneak peek."
4,Great design ideas--no projects.,"I agree with all the other reviewers: I was disappointed that there weren't patterns, but I also think the book provides really great design inspiration. The other two books on remaking clothing that I've looked at in the past three days (Generation T and Sew Subversive) were both quite basic and not that inspiring, design-wise... this book is much more design-conscious and exciting. For someone like me who has some confidence about messing around with materials, sewing, knitting, etc., this is a great book to get ideas bouncing around. But you'll have to work out the how-tos yourself, for the most part. Definitely a keeper, and well worth a look."
2,disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book. Part of the problem may be that I didn't realize that the book only applies to felted wool sweaters; none of the ideas presented in the book can be used for another other type of sweater. Additionally, there are very few patterns or specifics in the book; it consists mainly of photographs of projects that others have done."
3,Not exactly what I was expecting.,"A decent book. Very short. But if your looking for details on how to take a sweater apart, that is not what this book is about. This book is about how to use recycled material to make new, but goes into very little detail on how to take apart a sweater.But dont get me wrong. It definetly is good at inspiring you on how to recycle previously used items."
1,Just OK...,"I was disappointed with this book. It contained lots of general info about the ""art"" of chopping up a sweater but did not have enough specific instructions on new projects."
2,Ugh,This book is so boring and so difficult to pay attention to. Long chapters. Not worth making students purchase - no learning occurs.
3,not enough confrontations,good quality documentary dvd but once you have seen eternal enemies (lions and hyenas) this one leaves a lot to be desired.i missed the part where they were at war. no good confrontations between lions and leopards or any predators. i think a leopard was killed by a lion or another leopard by the river bank and a croc ends crawling up on the bank and dragging it into the river. sorry just not enough cat fights for me.
4,Another Goodie!,"This CD is special to me. Most of the songs are from the '80s, when I was a teenager. I've liked the Beach Boys since I was 9, and it was great seeing them make the '80s comeback they did. Both ""Wipeout"" and ""Kokomo"" are wonderful to listen to, and I hear them often. Both were huge hits during my high school days, and it takes me back everytime I hear them. The other songs are fun to listen to also. Of course, the '60s songs add a very nice touch. It was those songs that captured my attention from the start, when I was 9, the '60s hits, but no Beach Boys collection would be complete without this CD. It's one of my favorites."
1,Too Late,"It is sad that it has taken so long to publish this book, it would have been useful about a year and a half ago. By the time this book comes out VC++ 6 will be released and it will be time wasted on the part of the writer and the publisher."
4,Witness on the Quay,"Overall a delightful book to read. Gini Anding very obviously loves Paris and successfully communicates her enthusiasm for the city of light on nearly every page.The plot is excellent and the characters are vivid, the story flows with ease.I did find the ending a little abrupt which left me with a feeling of having missed the dessert cart somewhat.Her descriptions of Ille St. Louis and surrounding areas was very well done and her historical references were illuminating even though I have been walking Paris during constant visits for some 40 years.Also her characterisations of her ""players"" was remeniscent of the wonderfully studied style of Georges Simenon.I look forward to her next Paris based book."
1,"No pace, no tension. Couldn't finish it.","I would usually give any book set in Paris an automatic 3 stars, but not this one - I abandoned it on page 85 simply too bored to continue. Instead of a murder mystery, this book unfolds more like a cheap romance novel. The only purpose of the crime seems to be to have the main characters meet. The helpless American writer and the dashing French inspecter (who, of course, drives a Ferrari). This book has no pace or tension.Try the Aimee Leduc series by Cara Black for an edgier Paris read."
2,Impossible to Assemble,"My husband and his father are both very handy. Together, it took them about 5 hours to assemble this toy. The directions are incorrect, the drawings depicting how to assemble this thing are backwards.I'm giving this toy a low rating because it cost us about (...)and for that price it should have come preassembled.The other thing we didn't like about it was the shape, my children were much happier jumping on a plain round trampoline. We returned this ""fancy"" one to the store, and got the plain round one, for about half the price. My children like it much more, and my husband didn't have to spend half a Sunday putting it together."
4,GREAT TRAMPOLINE!,"WE GOT THIS FOR MY SON WHO WAS 2 1/2. NEEDLESS TO SAY IT WAS A GREAT WAY TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY. HE HAS TONS OF FUN JUMPING AND PUSHING THE BUTTONS AND CHANGING THE MUSIC! ALTHOUGH.. THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT SANTA CLAUSE DIDN'T ENJOY PUTTING IT TOGETHER... IT IS WORTH IT, BUT A PAIN!"
1,Absolutely ridiculous piece of junk,"Tried to follow the poorly illustrated directions (in French, by the way). It was impossible to assemble either alone or with a second adult. The bungie type cable must be manually stretched and hooked with an absurd little metal ring, while applying upwards of 100-150 lbs of tension. Will return for refund."
4,Keeps the kid from jumping on the bed!,"My son's occupational therapist suggested we get a trampoline to help give him some vestibular input and he has loved it. It has games that you jump along too. His favorite is ""Freeze"" where this nice british lady tells you to ""freeze,"" ""sit still"" then start back up.Assembly was tricky, but not that tricky. My wife and I got it together in less than an hour. You will need two people to get string up the actual trampoline part.I would give this 5 stars if the jumping space was a little bigger. My son and his friends don't seem to mind though!"
4,My Triplets Love It!,"I have soon-to-be 3 year-old triplets, one of whom has Autism. Our son's Physical Therapist recommended getting him a trampoline with handlebars, and this one certainly fit the bill. Hubby and I assembled it last night in about 2 hours (note: don't assemble if feeling the slightest bit cranky!). What a hoot! The triplets have been taking turns jumping on the trampoline all day, and love the sound effects. It seems fairly durable and is very colorful. We love the super-padded handlebars and padded bungee-cover. Just a great buy for a child's trampoline with handlebars!"
5,JumpSmart trampoline,"I was hesitant at first because I read other reviews claiming how hard it was to put together. I'll admit that it was a bit of a pain. It definitely takes two people to work on it. BUT... my 4 year old nephew LOVED it! It's fun, it helps him count to 100 which is what he is presently learning in 4 year old class and it gives him a way to get out some energy. My sister says he jumps on it every morning and then he's ready to get ready for school.So, I would definitely suggest it as a great gift! A little hard to put together but my nephew was completely worth it!"
4,Great fun but came with a broken cord.,"We just got this as a gift for my daughter's 2nd birthday. She loves it. Her 3 year old brother loves it as well. They have been jumping at every opportunity.It took my husband and I 1 hour and 20 minutes to assemble. The direction were tough to follow, especially the weaving of the bungee cord.The only real problem we found is that we couldn't get the sensor under the trampoline to work. Turns out our black cord that is threaded through the front frame that connects the music box to the sensor is severed in the middle. We only discovered it after gently pulling on the cord to make sure it was secure in the frame. I really don't want to return the trampoline since this was the last one at our Toys R Us and I'm not eager to have to assemble another one. Right now my kids are young and love jumping to the music. They don't even know that there is supposed to be games."
2,"Good in theory, not in real life.","When I first saw this I thought it was awesome. A way to combine exercise and learning. Only problem is, it takes forever to set up, plus it is more helpful if you have another person helping you with the cord. The sensor/string attached it to fell off and rendered it educationally useless. We had to take it apart when we moved and both my husband and I are dreading putting it back together...not worth the money."
4,Doesn't work and can't reach the company.,"""Santa"" gave this to our girls for Christmas. Both enjoy it and I think it will be a fun toy for them. The problem is we have been unable to get the ""trigger switch"" to work. It should count and play music etc. when they jump, but it does not. It seems the bungee is too tight and the switch is always engaged, so it doesn't do anything. I tried adjusting it for heavier or lighter children (my 3 year old is just over 30 lbs.), but nothing worked. I tried calling the number on the instructions, but that is disconnected, I tried checking their website, and it is not there. I'm hoping we can come up with some way to fix it since we aren't sending it back now that it is together. If anyone has any suggestions, please post a comment! As for putting it together, it did take two people, but was easy enough, thank goodness for college degrees. I gave it 4 stars overall because I do think our kids will have fun with it, even if we have to count for them!"
5,Worth every penny!!,"I bought this for my 2 year old last christmas to save my couch. It has been worth every penny!! I have alot of kids of all ages in and out of my house, and every one loves it. Parents have commented about the safety of it because of the handles for even the smallest of our friends. The ony complaint is the default volume is very loud. It can be turned down, but what kid voluntarily will do that!! We didn't find it that hard to assemble, but it's definitely a two person job. Santa was a winner with this one!!"
5,French Louie an Adirondack Jem,"Let me start this off by saying this is my favorite book of all time.I found it in my great-grandfather's library and i haven't been able to put it down. The story is very re-readable. The book hit home hard with me because I vacation up in Speculator and I have visited Louie's gravesite. Now the book isn't exactly all factual information but more of a colorful story of the area's history intertwined with the life and time's of Louie. Although Louie's slang is difficult to grasp at times, his slang is all a part of the experience. In the book there are about 30 black and white pictures of Louie and the gang. A very good read. But don't take my word for it, buy this book!"
2,Not very helpful,My son and I read this book together shortly after he was diagnosed with ADHD and it wasn't very helpful for either of us. I thought it was a waste of money and time.
4,A wonderful journey into ADD,"""Sparky's Excellent Misadventures"" is a wonderful little ""journal"" by Sparky, who takes us into his life at school and home as he copes with ADD. Sparky's misadventures acquaint us with those events which sometimes get him into trouble. After visiting the doctor, Sparky learns about ADD and discovers how the ""little pills"" help him to do better in school and control his behavior. This ""journal"" will help children and parents understand ADD from a child's point-of-view both before and after treatment. An easy-to-read, humorous approach to appreciating each child's unique qualities."
2,Not what I expected,My son got a pet hampster for his birthday and wanted to take to show his grandparents. When I saw this I thought it would be perfect plus he loved the schoolbus design. It was not what I would have expected. I have purchased many critter trail products in the past and have been very satisfied. Not this time. The first one I ordered was broken. THe plastic clips that locked the door in place were broken. Amazon was wonderful about the return and had a new to me the next day with no extra charge. After I got the new one I noticed how bad it was. The water cap keeps coming off the water bottle. The easy open lid intended for easy cleaning won't stay shut. The handle pops off and the plastic is paper thin. The only good thing is that it can connect to their other cages so you don't have to worry about empty water bottles and hatches that pop open. It does make a nice hideaway for the hampster
3,Hamster Died,"Bought it and before it got to us, the hamster died. Had to buy another hamster to use it. It's nice to have to take the pet with us."
3,Looks good anyhow,"My 4 year old son decided we needed on of theses buses for each of the two hamsters. One is still working great, the other not so much. The internal locking latch for the back window was chewed off in about two days. On the plus side they are very easy to clean inside because of the removable bottom."
4,Good.,"my hamster had to get used to it. it is pretty small, only can be used for mice anad dwarf hamsters, but its pretty good. it had a food bowl and a water bottle. the water bottle it retty hard to used though, i had to put a small peice of peper towel around the blue part before the metal peice to keep the metal on."
1,Gerbils Can Escape,"Like the design and like keeping the food all in a separate pod like this connected with a tube, but after about a month, the gerbils figured out how to unlatch the door from the inside. The latch is unprotected and easy for them to release."
5,A platter to stand the test of time,"While I have not used the platter yet, it is a good size, but not huge so it would be good if you had limited space but needed a platter. I have been using the matching dinnerware for about a month now and so far, I have not had any chips, scratches or issues. Probably the best thing about this platter is that is is made in Portugal, no China, and is freezer and oven safe, in addition to dishwasher and microwave safe. Haven't tried to put it in my micro yet, but not sure if it will fit."
4,Gourmet for Dummies,"I can boil water. I can scramble an egg. But I can't do much else. I needed a book that wouldn't just TEACH me to cook, but would ENCOURAGE me to do so. I found it in ""The Girl Can't Cook.""The book offers a wide range of recipes, from the basic, like ""Beans and Greens,"" to the exotic, like ""Mussels Viniagarette."" There are recipes for game day, holiday, every day. The organization took some getting used to--some by occasion, others by theme, others by culture--but is actually a more practical way to search for recipes.""The Girl Can't Cook"" encouraged me to try recipes (and ingredients) that I'd normally be intimidated by--but most importantly, they tasted GREAT. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that in some instances the recipes did taste simplified--that isn't to say that they were flavorless or didn't taste amazing, just simple."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"A transitional release for the band, ""Pagent"" shows the band's willingness to get commercial..but only in tenative, baby steps.New producer Don Gehman (John Cougar Melloncamp) does all he can to make the band radio friendly and maintain the air of mystery..hence big time 80's bombastic sound combined with Stipes muffled, almost hidden vocals (the Band's M.O. up to the release of ""Document"").For the very first time, the material isn't up to the usual high standard that made the first three releases outright classics, with a quarter of the songs mearly ok but skimpy and the band's first throwaway (""Underneath The Bunker"") making an appearance. The notion that the band may have been short of material is reaffirmed by some of the songs which date from the band's earliest days (""Just A Touch"").All in all, it bridges ""Fables"" and ""Document"" nicely, but it could've been much better if it had been developed more fully."
5,"REM most underrated album, by far!","""Murmur"" and ""Automatic For The People"" get most of the attention from the critics, and deservedly so. They are two great albums that deserve their place in the top lists of 80 and early 90s albums. However, I personally believe this album ranks right up there. You don't hear this album mentioned at all, and yet it has some of REM's finest songs... ""I Believe"" ""Fall On Me"" ""Swan Swan H"" ""Begin the Begin"" ""Cuyohoga"" ""Superman""... heck, every song is a winner. I remember this as the album that first introduced me to REM, and it is still the one that I look for when I want to get my CD case loaded with good music for a road trip. It is beyond my imagination why it has never gotten the respect it deserves."
4,"""Chinese Food""--how apt","Another reviewer called this album ""Chinese Food R.E.M."", and I think that sums it up pretty well. I like when I'm listening to it, but with the notable exceptions of 'Swan Swan H' and 'Hyena', I rarely remember any of it. I think it's a good album, don't get me wrong--but it's the most consistent R.E.M. album, which means that the highs and lows have been smoothed out. It's certainly not my favorite album, R.E.M. or otherwise. I prefer the other hit-or-miss albums, if only because the good ones are really good (and this is the 21st century. You can skip the bad ones.). Of course, 'Hyena' and 'Swan H' are great. I'll even put myself in the minority here and say I love 'Underneath the Bunker'.This one definitely beats 'Green', 'Murmur', 'Out of Time', and I never bothered to listen to anything after 'Monster' (though I liked that one). Overall, if you're new to R.E.M., you'll probably like this one. If not, you'll probably like it anyway."
5,Soundtrack to my early love life,"Sitting in my car in front of her house, 2am on a summer's evening, listening to this album. Sneaking into the backyard and waking her with pebbles against the window pane."
4,Images aren't there in the digital download,I wish the images would have been included in the download. So much of the information in this book would be enhanced and better understood with the original images.
3,The book is good....but the many errors make it hard to read,"I'm working my way through this book as I type this. There have been many errors in the first couple of hundred pages. Some of them so fundamental (such as: he said ""restore"" when ""backup"" was clearly what he meant) that if you aren't reading it carefully, you'll be very confused by his seeming contradictions. I don't believe many of these are the author's fault, and could probably be put down to poor editing and even worse proofing. But readers beware: It'll trip you if you aren't careful!"
3,Half Empty or Half Full,"This book has very good materials on ASP security. Easy reading, occasionally, you will have to turn to previous pages for clarifications. Other than that, it shows an organized way to implement security for ASP. However, when it comes to MTS & ADSI, it is just an introductory at best. If you need to know more about MTS & ADSI, this is not the book for you."
2,A little bit of everything,This book got a little bit of everything. Do not expect that you'll be proficient on any of the subjects discussed
4,Wild East Productions....This is the one to buy!,"On a dark,stormy night,a young boy named Bill witness the murders of his parents and sister at the hands of four vicious thieves.He is saved by a mysterious stranger,fifth intruder and fifteen years later,consummed with hatred,he gets his only clue to the identies of the killers when a stranger guns down two men who might be linked to the murders.Bill and the stranger, Ryan form an uneasy alliance and set out to find the gang,each with his own need for vengence.........after 15 years its to bad you can only kill them once........great movie,one of the better italian westerns,but buy this version only by Wild East Production its a great copy of the movie the rest are not worth your money........get it while it lasts cause it will be sold out!"
3,"Solid Movie, Lousy DVD","I have always liked this obscure Italian western. Lee Van Cleef is outstanding and off sets to some extent, the dull monotone performance of John Phillp Law. Leone stalwarts Luigi Pistilli and Mario Brega also are in the film. The DVD quality is atrocious, the picture is horrible and is in miserable pan and scan to boot. Hopefully one day this film will be restored and given proper DVD treatment. Widescreen folks! Pan and scan just does not make it. That was the big mistake VHS made. If this had nice picture quality and was in widescreen, I would give it 4 stars easily."
1,DID THE OTHER GUYS SEE THE SAME MOVIE I DID?,"This moive has bad video, really bad. Its like those cheap kung fu movies you by for six bucks. The scrip is less than poor. The acting for the most part is bad. Law and Van Cleef's acting was for the money and they just went through the paces. The action was just fake guns going off and not interesting. One of the worst westerns that I have seen. If the rating system had a score of negative I would have given it that."
2,Poor Quality,Lee Van Cleef is awesome as always and carrys the flick. Downer note quality of DVD is poor and seems like a 6th generation VHS copy. Great Movie and Plot but the quality ruins it. 2.5 stars
2,A rerelease your best bet,"If you are a fan of this western, just be warned that the quality of the film is horrible. The print has not been restored at all, and the picture suffers from faded colours, specks and a dirty print. Still, it has Lee Van Cleef and Ennio Morricone doing the score. If the quality of the print doesn't bother you, then the 10 bucks for this DVD isnt that much."
1,Worst playing video I've seen to date.,This review is mainly to warn all of the poor video quality I experenced with the VHS tape by the studio: 'Diamond Entertainment'. The video started out playing so dark I had to set my TV's brightness controls up all the way just to see anything. It also had poor tracing and just overall poor film quality. The DVD version is probably a better bet. I've seen the movie before on 'Mean Guns 20 Movie Pack - DVD' and there the movie looked pretty good. The Movie itself was not bad when seen with a nice quality DVD or maybe another studio's video.
3,better than average spaghetti western.,Death rides a horse has the typical revenge plot however it has a good music score and van cleef and phillip law do a pretty good job at conjuring up mayhem!!Worth a look!
4,westerns,"When I heard about this movie, I wanted to buy it, Lee van cleef is great in this movie,I learned alot about this great actor and his westerns, There is a good story to this movie.I am glad that I bougth this movie.thank you."
2,Very Disappointed!,"I purchased this movie because I have been looking for a good copy, however this was not it. The first half of the movie is very fuzzy and the second half is a little better, but not by much. Unless you like your movies to play like the old VHS tapes, pass this one by."
1,Death Rides a Horse,Unfortunately the disc was not playable. I had to just throw it away!!!I recieved a copy through Netflix and all is well. The new disc I recieved from Amazon was badly scratched. You might want to check with your supplier who shipped you damaged goods. Thank You DJN
2,Poor Quality,"The quality of this transfer is incredibly sub par. I was beyond disappointed, as Lee Van Cleef is one of my all time favorite Spaghetti Western actors, and I had heard amazing things about this film. No qualms with the story or film itself."
3,"Really could be a 4, but John Phillip Law brings it down a notch...","It is easier for me to say what I didnt like about this movie, as it was only one thing....John Phillip Law....HORRIBLE ACTOR..dont know why this guy would be chosen for anything, let alone a role that could have provided some coolness...and his John Wayne impersonation everytime he opened his mouth was horrible....other than that...great Van Cleef..great Morricone..and a good story...so definitely worth watching..."
1,"a 4 star movie,but a no star transfer","i have always liked this movie and i think lee van cleef was a very underated actor so i couldn't wait to watch this one again.i know for this cheep a price that i shouldn't think i'm going to get a great copy but come on,no widescreen,washed out color audio that pops and sometimes drops out completely,and so dark in some scenes that you can't see anything at all!don't waste your money on this badly transfered disc,find a better copy"
3,Similar to For a Few Dollars More,"For fans of the spaghetti western genre, Death Rides a Horse will remind them of For A Few Dollars More, one of Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy starring Clint Eastwood. While very similar the film is still worth watching. Lee Van Cleef is awesome, as usual, with John Phillip Law giving a decent performance albeit without much emotion. Usual cast of supporters in the genre with Luigi Pistilli and Mario Brega and even a small part with Anthony Dawson. Excellent storyline with one of the best endings in the spaghetti genre. However the DVD is of very poor quality with no extras offered whatsoever. Do what I did and wait for Turner Classic Movies to air it in widescreen and tape it. Only reason I give this DVD 3 stars is because of the quality. The movie on its own would probably be closer to five."
3,Heroes Of World Class Wrestling,"It was somewhat interesting, but I had already watched the WWE's version and even though I hate to admit it. I found the WWE's version better."
3,little bit disappointed,"I have to admit I was disappointed after watching this DVD. Maybe I'm too young and had never the chance to see anything of world class when it was around. The point is the minor quality which makes it hard to follow the story. For me as a non native speaker i hardly understand what David von Erich is saying in his interviews, I better understand what the wind is whispering. And a little bit of light can't cost that much. They should spend a little more money for the production.And am I blind, there is not one single match to see as a bonus?"
3,"It is good, just they glossed over the end really fast","This is a cool documentary. I just found that they glossed over Kerry's death so fast at the end and it was strange. It was like they ran out of time and just hurriedly got through it. It's like Kerry Von Erich was the biggest star of World Class and they should have talked about it more. It was good, especially the comments by Marc Lowrance. It's recommended for sure, just wasn't as good as people made it out to be when it first came out."
3,Certainly worth watching if you enjoyed the old wccw days,"If you enjoyed the wrestling back when it was WCCW and the Von Erichs then this is certainly a dvd to add to your collection. Also, If remember correctly, this is the dvd that did provide clips from those days, interviews with Kevin, and also the end shows some big names that have passed along with their ages and what happened. That was interesting as well. I had not realized how many young superstars had passed at such young ages and the way that they had."
2,I slept with the wrong movie!,"This movie, like many of its characters, was not at all what it appeared to be at first look. The plot was intriguing, and I love Matthew Broderick, so I snapped it up at my local video store. Sadly, my enjoyment was ruined by the forehead-slapping lack of credible action by the characters. I had a few laughs at the antics of performance artist Pastel, played by Jean Tripplehorne, and a few of Broderick's blind dates were amusing to watch, but most of the time I was torn between liking the characters (except the ones you're not supposed to like, the movie will make it obvious who they are) and hating their actions. By the time Sciorra wails ""I slept with the wrong guy!"" I was over it."
4,Good job for all 3 of room mate.,"My favorite point is, after Ellen has slept wrong guy Brian in his apartment house, the man who has been misunderstood by Ellen,so Ellen did approach to Brian. Those two of conversation was very funny. Brian tried Ellen calm down, but all of his ward to the contrary. One more good point is, Ellen got a taxi the way her back home, taxi driver's reaction or response make me laugh very much.I could give you one more point, Brian's fiancee gets into the room without knocking door, while Sam(movie star)getting a lucky and she destroyed everything. how poor guy Sam was! and please look at how Sam insult Brian's fiancee just after! Sam has a lot of vocabularies. and music was very nice too. Check it out."
2,millenium filter,this product is hard to find in pet stores for some reason. It seems to get clogged up and need replacing very quickly. It is always a pain to get them in and out of teh filter
4,good quality.. highly recommended,we have a 20 gallon fish tank with about six kois and comets and recently purchased the Marineland Millennium 3000 filter system and i must say we are very pleased with it. Our tank is always so crystal clear. All you need to do is rinse the cartridges every so often and re-use. we have used one for over a month without any problems.
5,LOVE!!!,"These are the Best Bath Salts I have ever used! Very natural, relaxing, don't dry your skin out and smell fantastic."
2,sorry what were we talking about?,"Generally the ideas he present are pretty interesting, but they are presented in a way to often leaves me very confused. Ecology and CAS are subjects I have studied separately and so I understand them both. However, in his writing Levin often goes on tangents, presents unrelated examples, and has a hard time getting his point across."
4,intelligent but alarmist,"Levin has produced a rich, nuanced and detailed account of how complexity theory may further our understanding of ecological processes. He does not shy away from the tough questions: How do ecosystems assemble themselves? What is the relationship between an ecosystem's structure and function? Does evolution increase the resiliency of an ecosystem? In addressing these and other questions, Levin offers both real world examples and sophisticated theory. Regrettably, Levin often fails to distinguish between what he knows as a scientist and what he has decided to take on faith based on the statements of environmentalist advocacy groups. As a result, the book is a strange amalgam of excellent ""popular"" science and overearnest environmental alarmism."
5,great book,"this is the kind of book that will be treasured down through the years.not an investment of money,but rather a feeling of well being"
5,Great series!,"I am a mom of two children (6yr old girl & 3yr old boy), and our whole family loves this series! The kids always pick one of the DVD's in the What's New set to watch in our van, or at home, etc. Great stories - I highly recommend this series."
5,A Mother of 3.,"My kids and I just love Scooby-Doo,we have all there movies,and all the What's new releases,plus alot of the old shows that I grew-up with.I hope they don't stop making Scooby-Doo movies and cartoons,because it would be a shame,I know alot of families that also love this loveable charater.Allthe Scooby-Doo movies,what's new Scooby-Doo vol.'s,and there old stuff isjust great.It comes with alot of fun loving excitiment,and humor,and it is something good,and clean for all ages alike.Please pass this info. along and stop the ending of any and all Scooby-Doo shows,movies,and episodes alike.thanks c. brown"
1,"This bag is too small to hold a basic set of fins, snorkel and mask.",I ABSOLUTLY disagree!!!! OMG this bag pissed me off and I am easy to please. This thing holds Nooooothing. My fins barely fit into it. There is no way to get a snorkel or mask into it also.DO NOT BUY. I am trying to figure out how to send it bad. So ticked.
2,Hit And Miss,"This third volume is just not as appealing as the first two were. The strong hooks aren't there, the pop sensibility isn't either. Too many of these sides are forgettable."
4,A wee bit too empty...,"The stand up itself: Excellent. I laughed the whole way through. The man is funny, what can i say... But the dvd was, how shall i put this?, low on features. You get Craig's speech a Fanuel Hall, which is nice and also a brief interview of him; but that's really it. I mean I know its only a stand up special, but I expected ""A Wee Bit o' Revolution"" to have ""A Wee Bit"" more... All in all, good dvd; worth the money if you like Craig Ferguson (i know i do) and his humor."
2,Rental only,I bought this DVD for my husband (who watches Ferguson on TV nightly) and we watched it together but neither of us found him to be very funny in this format. Alot of the jokes we've heard before. Now that we own it I dought we'll ever watch it again. I would recommend renting it but not for purchase.
3,Not really Revolutionary,There was hardly any political jokes or political satire in it at all. I don't even think Craig poked fun at any of the politicians from the UK. You would think with the cover photo being Craig sitting on an old-fashioned throne there would be a Prince Charles impression thrown in or something. Also I have to admit that when he's not dressed in a suit somehow his gay jokes lose quite a bit of their zing. This stand-up show ended up being a drawn-out crazed ramblings about abusing substances and semi-amusing impressions. I would rather stick to his Late Late Show offerings that seem to be a more well-endowed robust comedy routine. Probably due to the padded support of the mighty CBS corporation.
1,"Trying to laugh, disappointing,not worth it","I had such high hopes for this DVD. I like Craig on T.V. and thought ""wow this was going to be fantastic!"". I wouldn't pay to go to one of his shows.I almost laughed twice."
5,Entertaining reading from a very funny man,No one does more with less than Craig Ferguson; the best and brightest of late night. A great read.
4,Humorous Yet Serious Thought on America,If you want to think and laugh at the same time --- this is the DVD for you! I have now viewed this DVD numerous times with family and friends and have laughed out loud (big thing for me!) every time.
5,Amazing as always,"Just like most DVDs that have Craig Ferguson as the main subject matter... Craig is absolutely fantastic! Hilarious and witty and a bit dirty but gosh you gotta love him. But the DVD features are, as usual, lacking. This has a couple nice extras on it including one of my favorite speeches Craig did in Boston. But really, when you're looking to get this it isn't for DVD features. It's for Craig. If you're a fan you should already have this, simple as that. If you're not a fan you should get it and become a fan!"
4,Ferguson firing on all cylinders.,"Primo fun, high energy, non-stop flashes of wit.Craig hits a grand slam at a cozy theatre in Boston.So good, so good, so good, makes you feel so good.Hope he comes to Portland sometimeso my friends and I can see him in person."
4,Craig fans Unite,"If you like Craig, you will like this! Not as exciting as his nightly show, but, definitively worth owning!I have passed it to all my friends who can't stay up for his show, and, this has made fans of all of them!There are some great moments!"
5,Want to present well? You better see this!,"This DVD is wonderful! I'm an experienced media trainer in Australia who has learnt a whole lot from watching Doug's presentation. His technique for imparting messages is flawless and his key points are simple yet so effective.I highly recommend this video to anyone who wants to perfect the art of presenting. I will watch it time and time again with the hope that each time a little more of Doug Jefferys' comfortable confident, authoritatve style will rub off on me.PS. If you're ever after media training in Australia contact me: sandyk@bigpond.net.au"
2,Killer Presentation,"I am not totally convinced after watching this you will make KILLER PRESENTATIONS. The video is a compilation of many sessions edited (not well) together,in fact at some points it is very distracting.The presenter gives you techniques to follow, and then he doesn't do them himself, which to me is a bit hypocritical.It is not the best video on presentation skills, but there are some valid points. I would not recommend this video as ""the"" video on presentation skills, but take what you can from it."
5,Great video!,"I've attended a couple classes/seminars in the past about how to give a presentation, but this was much better. It covered ideas that I had not seen before, and it was also a great refresher of the ideas that I had seen. The presentation was very well organized, dynamic, and entertaining as well as educational. It also went more in-depth than other presentations I have seen on topics such as making eye contact with one person at a time vs ""spraying"" the audience with the eyes. The presentation was filmed at three live seminars, so it was like gettimg the best of all three, plus a few comments on the side as well."
2,Disappointing,"This DVD was so disappointing. I purchased it based on the recommendation of the reviewers. First, it flips through three different locations, which is annoying. Secondly, it covers just the basics of presenting. Rapport requires far more advanced skills that are suggested by a reviewer. There is no significant content substance from an advanced speaker's prespective. While the presenter is very good in both style and delivery, you can glean this information off any public speaking website. His language skills, humor and pace are excellent, but when you boil down the common knowledge content, you feel a bit ripped off for paying the hefty price of $99.00. Id' give the content a 1 star. His style is deserving of more, but the price really should have been around $59.00 in my opinion. So I'm giving the product only 2 stars. Also, his marketing staff should make it clear this is beginner stuff."
2,Worthless if you're not using Power Point 2007,"I purchased this DVD and have had MAJOR difficulties reproducing the results that are being demo'd on the DVD. I am pretty tech savvy and I am finding myself completely frustrated at the moment. I have watched DVD multiple times and I'm following along step by step, yet it's not working. I have a more recent version of PPT, but that really shouldn't be an issue in my mind. Too bad it's too late for a refund. Give it shot if you own PPT 2007, but I wouldn't bother wasting your money if I were you. It's hardly worth the aggravation for the steep price that you are paying. Sorry to say that I am very dissatisfied. So my recommendation is to not waste your money and look elsewhere."
2,Old Hardware Ver 1.,"Pros: Can print using LPR(this is what I'm using), IPP or SMB. File server works. Software works with XP just fine.Cons: Wireless connection will not work at all with my linksys WRT54G wireless router. Locks up the linksys router. Can't even get them to talk without any security set.The hardware is very OLD. The hardware is version 1. The firmware is old also comes with v1.24. I tried updating to v2.28 but this one is useless too. Went back and installed v1.26.Latest software will not work with Windows 7 64, works fine with XP.Other Thoughts: Luckly, I don't really need this to be wireless. Should have bought a cheaper wired print server from my local Fry_s. Does work and it would cost too much to return, and spent more than enough hours trying to make it work...."
4,Another Belle and Sebastian's Masterpiece,All I can say is this album will make me missing their current tour that much painful. Catchy tunes. One of the best albums of 2006 so far.
2,It's amazing how good these guys could be...,"Why do artists get horrible when they are famous for a while...It happens to everyone. I can't think of a group or artist who still puts out great material like in their prime. This is not a good album. At all. It just sounds wack. In the Cd insert there is a letter from a fan who asks them to stop over producing their albums. To do an album like Beach Boy's Party. They should. Or somehting. They may get a good pitchfork review and fans loving them and magazines saying how awesome they are, but this is a really bad album. Don't buy it. Run away. See em live... They still sound good live. But as far as albums go...this was a real dissapointment. Life is short. Find another band. There is tons of stuff out there like Belle and Sebastian. Granted they had some outstanding albums. They should break up. Just stop. And for everoyne giving this 5 stars...please. You should stop writing reviews becasue you look real dumb."
5,What an unexpectedly great album,"On ""Dear Catastrophe Waitress"" it sounded like Belle & Sebastian showed up at the recording studio & found an actual BAND insisting on joining in. The results were spotty.Wow, have they gotten it together on ""Life Pursuit."" It's the 1st B&S; album where Stuart's vocals haven't been my favorite songs. There are some brilliantly catchy pop tunes on here; I can't quit singing ""The Blues Are Still Blue.""The 70's-sounding hooks and singing are a blast. It's like the group has finally made good on the promise of ""Lazy Line Painter Jane.""P.S.--Fundamental fans who want endless repetition of the first 3 albums, go away. B&S; is evolution in progress."
4,"Smart pop, now with less artery-clogging filler","While not a complete reinvention (although a few tracks beg to differ), TLP came on strongly revitalized in pop assertiveness, managing to rework some of the same old formulas this alternative-folk-rock-pop cult cultivator have been playing with over the years. Here, the effort to give these songs a new sheen pays off, with smart production work amping up material that would otherwise sound stale."
4,"Very Good, Again","Consistency marks this band, with good song after good song, on every CD. Songwriters talents with unique voices that makes listening a pleasure. Again!"
5,Fantastic CD,"This is pure pop bliss. The band has certainly been changing their sound with the last few records, but to my ear it is for the better. In their old incarnation they could, at times, be montonous. Almost every song on this album shines. The song Suki in the Graveyard is one of the best songs I have heard in years. Highly Recommended."
4,I Recommend,"I first came to know Belle & Sebastian when my pal Patrick put ""Lazy Line Painter Jane"" on for me. As I was preparing for a bus trip to Los Angeles, he said the song reminded him of me (you will find a boy tonight/ on the first bus out of town). I bought a few Belle & Sebastian albums since and enjoyed them but it was Dear Catastrophe Waitress which hooked me, and then lo and behold this album came out.The Life Pursuit is just as good as Waitress and then some. Great tracks like ""Sukie In The Grave Yard"" and ""The Blues Are Still Blue"" show what a great and diverse band this is. The music kicks it, the lyrics are completely witty and the songs are actually very catchy. Highly recommended!"
5,AMAZING CD,"This is by far the best CD Belle and Sebastian have put out to date, that being said all of the CDs are 5 stars!"
5,great pop music.,"chosen by mojo magazine as the 25th best album of 2006, this is in my top 10 of the year. their 2nd best album (after ""if you're feeling sinister""), this recording brims with great pop songs. smart lyrics, fresh vibrant music, outstanding melodies: i love the thing from beginning to end. wonderful stuff."
2,This is where they lost me,"Okay, I'm not one of the B&S fans who expect them to be fey and wispy even when age and dignity would dictate otherwise. I followed them on all their weird journeys. I loved ""Dear Catastrophe Waitress"" and shook my head at all the bad things people said about it...but the seeds of this major disappointment were sown in there with the cutesy hooves in ""Roy Walker""...this new album is first of all too long (it's a double on vinyl) and I can't BELIEVE there wasn't 5-6 songs that could be culled from it easily. There's a couple good tunes and melodies but mostly it just seems to be the band delighting in being a band..their playing is certainly at their best, but throwing in everyone's songs, regardless of quality, just to 'rock out' is not helping anyone. Stuart's songs are okay, but barely any muscle or hooks to the melodies. The end of an era, unless they straighten up. Who would of believed it, but the great B&S have worn out their welcome."
3,Losing patience and faith,"I've had this album for a month, or maybe two--anyhow, I've had it since it came out. I had such high hopes, as I did for Dear Catastrophe Waitress. Admittedly, there were some gems on that album, if you can ignore the ridiculous Roy Walker. This album doesn't do anything for me. As another reviewer said, they once had 'it' but that 'it' is sorely lacking here. I love the cover art, I love the album name, but inside it's a vapid mess."
2,The End of an Era,"I was the biggest, hugest, most excited Belle and Sebastian fan, EVER. I even continued to follow them after Fold Your Hands, Child....which was not their best. Then they won me back with Catastrophe, which is one of their best. They made a great comeback. I ignored all the hipsters who were catching on to them too late without knowing what they were getting into. I watched everything get reissued and become less and less of a ""secret"". And all the changes in lineups and spinoffs. Now, I think with this album they've turned into a big crowd-pleasing bore. The songs are lively without life and the lyrics are mundane and cheesy. Maybe it's the production. Maybe it's the pressure. But guys, this ISN'T it. This is not the same band. And if this is your favorite album of theirs, you just don't get it. They need to call it quits and step back for a bit. I'm just disappointed."
2,totally disappointing.,"As a huge Belle & Sebastian fan, I bought this album blindly (never listened before). Not a single catchy song and that's what they do -- make catchy songs. Makes me wistful for the late nineties."
5,B&S are gonna make you move your butts - stop fighting it.,"B&S; just keep getting tighter and tighter. Stuart's lyrics get more and more clever. And the more diverse their sound gets, the better they play. This is the most stripped-down B&S; LP ever, but it's also the most uptempo and immediately satisfying release.C'mon, B&S; fans. It won't kill you to stop shoegazing for 48 minutes and just bounce around with a stupid grin on your face. Tigermilk showed us a decade ago that we could be tortured by angst and still dance our butts off.It IS wicked not to care about this LP."
5,Flawless,"Not much to add to the discourse except to say that this now ranks as my favorite Belle and Sebastian album. Every song is a gem. In fact, the songs on here are so flawless, so memorable, so catchy, so well-composed, that this set of songs could qualify as a ""Greatest Hits"" album all by itself. All the components that fans love about the band remain intact. If you have enjoyed ANY of their previous albums don't miss this one too."
5,They just keep getting better,"I hadn't listened to B&S; in a few years. I had and loved several of their early singles and an album or 2, but somehow lost track of them.There was an ad for the new release on the back of UNCUT the other month and I kept looking at it and saying ""I really ought to see what those guys are up to.""I finally did and boy was I shocked.This has to be the best pop album I've heard in forever. Just hit-single after hit-single. Well, amazing-should-be hit-singles...you know, with a few f-bombs dropped in.Long story short: this is the 1st great album of '06 and I will be shocked to see it topped (not that that would be a bad thing, just really hard to conceive right now) A rock-solid 5/5 stars."
4,Nice.,"This is not If Your Feeling Sinister, and that's OK. It seems that Stuart has channeled Brian Wilson instead of Nick Drake for this one, and I'm really glad he did. The harmonies are amazing, the arrangement fantastic and the production is superb. This might be one of my favorite Belle & Sebastian records (along with Sinister and the Lazy Linepainter Jane EP). Belle & Sebeastian have become a perfect band who seem to play off each other beautifully. I'm glad to see that after all these years they can still make a new album that actually sounds new. If you like the whole Belle & Sebastian catalogue and are not just a Sinister fan then you'll love this."
2,Limited audience,"This book has a very limited audience and I recommend you to have a very good Math background (very above average) to read it. It's almost impossible to find an objective book that goes directly to the point. If you need all the math formulation for the models, this book is for you. If you just need to understand the basic of DEA without any math formulation, just intuitive thinking... forget it.PS: This book contains the DEA SOLVER software limited to 50 variables (DMU's)"
2,poor advertising,This is a pretty good book with the noteable exception that it doesn't actually include the DEA-Solver Software (as advertised on the cover and in the amazon add.
1,Disappointing,"The book does not come with the DEA Solver Software. This is contrary to what is stated on the front cover as well as to numerous references and exercises directing the reader to the software. Without the software, a significant component of the learning experience is missing."
2,Product set,"The outline content of the book is excellent. Nevertheless, it was delivered without the CD-ROM which makes it impossible for interested readers to follow the exercises given."
2,Mathematical techniques of extremely limited usefullness,"The two stars in my rating are not so much a comment on quality (although it has all the glitter of a 1940's graduate math tome), but as a warning that it is likely to be of value to an extremely limited audience. I would strongly suggest looking through a copy to verify its usefullness to what you want to do before investing money in buying it.It sets up the machinery and provides examples of methods to determine distance from a linearly defined boundary of paramaterized point sets. If this is what you need to do, then it will indeed be a useful book.However wider claims of great usefullness in analyzing general performance of businesses, or any other entities characterized by incomplete information and random variation, need to be accepted cautiously. Hence my warning that it will be of very limited usefullness to the majority of analysts, and it would be well to verify that it addresses the problem one needs to solve before buying it."
4,an overlooked gem,"Perry Lentz is a bit of a legend at Kenyon College, the school where he teaches and where he penned this fine novel as an undergrad. History buffs and lovers of fine fiction will find much to praise in this book. There's action, moral dilemma, and great characters, all placed in a detailed (but fascinating) historical cutout of one of the Civil War's least known but most notable battles. Lentz's writing is rich and sonorous, urging me to ask again, ""Why is no one reading this book?"""
2,"How many times can one man use the word ""flesh""?","For a book that started with so much promise, it really fell flat. Dreadfully needed at least one character who was likeable or at least not annoying. But anything good that might have come from the actual writing was ruined with the author's eventual overuse of the word ""flesh"". At least once a page, sometimes once a paragraph, some times more than once a sentence. Who edited this thing, anyway? Give this man a Thesaurus. It distracted me to the point where I couldn't enjoy the story."
5,"It's a wonderful refreshing return to the ""Old REM.""","I bought this album because I had been deprived of the REM music and style that I loved. It's a good album and it has a lot of their best music on it from up to when it was published. I recommend it for people who like REM, but don't want to necessarily buy all of their old albums."
5,"If you like REM's new stuff, see how much better this is","I've been an REM fan for a long time and will always be, but their new music (Up and Hi-Fi) just doesn't compare to their early work. Seeing as how this is an early greatest hits disc, it's a good one to listen to to get familiar with REM's earlier stuff. It's The End of The World alone is reason enough to buy the CD, but the other hits are classic REM that I never tire of hearing. I love this CD."
5,"A Fine Album for People Who ""Get"" Music","This CD, a collection of pre-Warner Bros. REM singles, delivers a great set of poetic rock hits. Some songs are conspicuouly absent to devoted fans, such as the beautiful ""Perfect Circle,"" but newer listeners will be impressed by such winners as ""It's the End of the World as We Know It"" and ""The Finest Worksong."" This album gets two enthusiastic thumbs up."
4,"A classic tale, with great illustrations!","Who hasn't heard of this tale, Little Red Riding Hood? There's Little Red, the grandmother, the woodsman, and, of course, the hungry wolf. In this version [spoiler alert... as if needed], the woodsman sews rocks into the belly of the wolf, and it just falls over, dead!Interestingly, why the rocks? In an unrelated nonfiction book,Vicious: Wolves and Men in America, author Jon T. Coleman discusses why ""we"" are particularly ""vicious"" toward wolves. Thus, in this tale, the wolf isn't simply killed, but it has to be punished. Thanks, Grimm!"
4,Red Vines candy,"Delicious, but have difficulty finding them. If you want more than this you are not getting any review from us at all."
4,Great Live Recording!,"Anyone who's seen SNFU live will appreciate all the little extras here - the jokes, commentary and dialogue with the audience. I generally don't like live recordings, but this one is tight and sounds great. Featuring some of their best material - old and new, including the hard to find 'Womanizer' (origionally found on an 'It Came From Canada' compilation I believe - find that if you can).If you're a fan, you'll also love the Wheat Chiefs - members of SNFU without Chi Pig."
5,Creative Inspire T3000 3-Piece Powered Speaker System,The system works great and freinds can't beleave how good it sounds!!!!!
1,Horrible,"These speakers sound horrible. The highs are non-existant, the mids are muffled and the bass is ""poppy"". I thought for under $40 the price was right, but I wouldn't keep them if they were free. I'll be making my first ever return to Amazon."
2,i gave it 2 stars because i wouldnt know if it sounded good!!!,"I think this product is horrible, because all i got was static from the speakers. The whole thing wouldnt turn on and the a/v power adapter for it was the problem. They must have given me a faulty speaker system, because it took me 2 hours until i got it to make static. I did what it said and nothing worked, oh and by the way the instructions dont have any words on them, just a diagram that tells you how to plug it up to the tv or the computer. The av adapter is able to be lost very easily, and i dont know if it would work."
3,Good At First,I purchased these speakers about 11 months ago. Up until recently they have given me great sound. But the sound now starts to fade in and out. Creative usually makes a great product. Maybe try a different Model.
4,Value for Money...,I wanted to buy a speaker that would be a value for money. I was willing to spend only $20. That is when I saw this product. I didn't mind spending $10 more if I could get a good subwoofer.I had a 4.1 Creative speaker previously and this obviously has a better bass than the 4.1 I had.I recommend this speaker for everyone looking for good quality on a budget!
5,Terrific Value,"Sound which really did pleasantly surprise and impress me particularly for the price I paid. Definitely a great value, and produces top notch volume and quality. Wired remote and headphone jack a plus. A winner."
3,Good for the price,"OK these sound great for $50 speakers, but they're not spectacular. Reviews here had me irrationally expecting fantastic audio pumping out of my PC. They do sound great though for just $50(ish)."
3,"Good look, but poor sound power",The Creative line of products is beauty and estetically presented. But this item in particular offers poor performance. The tweeter sound is imperceptible and the woofer not have enough power. Definitively tha Cambridge Soundworks line is highly superior.
4,Great Speakers,"I have used these speakers for a while now, they work great, just don't put your cell phone next to it or you'll get buzzing sounds whenever a signal goes your cell phone. I like the corded remote control that comes with these speakers because you don't have to reach for the box to turn the volume. There are two sets of outlets for headphones on the corded remote, which is convenient."
5,Quick steps to learn to read music,"If you want to quickly learn to read music and have a clear idea of every kind of musical sign, this book is REALLY helpful."
2,"Not that great, there are better books on that subject","It's quite interesting when people describe this book as groundbreaking in learning sight seeing music. I didn't feel the same way. I understand that there are probably worse books, but this one reminded me my old musical school- I could play accordion but I never learned how to read notes. This book didn't help much as well. It's written in uninteresting manner in kind of boring monotony. I would recommend books of Bruce Arnold on that particular subject, or any musical subject. Quiet unorthodox teaching. This book, on the other hand, just....disappointing. I sent it back."
1,Not for me,"I am an absolute beginner and wanted a self-teaching book. It did not work with me, although I was highly motivated and enthusiastic about it.The reading is indeed boring, as other customer writes, and it failed to hang my interest. I found it hard to go beyond the very first pages, and finally I put it asideI guess it is a very good book, because it covers virtually all the aspects of basic music instruction, but I didn't find it helpful at the stage where I am. I will try now ""You can read music"" by Amy Appleby..let's see...."
5,Linda shaw is a great romantic author!,"This book is wonderful. It's full of hope, love, fear, caring and love that anyone might exprience. I suggest everyone read this book and all of Linda Shaw's books. She can tell a romantic story as well as any of them. I give her and her books 10 stars!!!!"
5,Awesome pads.,"This is great for the skin, it doesn't dry complexion out, makes it more even and pimple free. Also face looks refreshed and younger. Totally love it, so simple and cheap but better than more expensive pads I've tried."
4,Wonderful for skin care,I use thayers witch hazel as a face toner and decided to try the pads. My only complaint is they're very thin and a little rough feeling. I would not recommend it for someone with very sensitive skin.
5,Very Satisfied,"I purchased this to clean my cat's ears- she gets a medication via gel in her ear and regular cleaning is imperative. I tried alcohol, but it was too harsh for her."
5,These are great for cleansing and conditioning your skin,I am hooked on these witch hazel pads! They clean up leftover makeup after regular washing and they leave you skin feeling clean and refreshed. Have been using them for about 4 months now and I have noticed a difference in my skin tone. Very convenient to use also.
4,Beauty is Only Skin Deep,"and I want mine to be as clear as possible. This product is excellent. It's a true value. It cleans, tones and conditions. I will definitely re-order. I am truly satisfied."
3,Not valuable,"This item has a strong alcohol smell, not as good as bottle toners. And I don't what I can do with it."
3,A decent bio,This is a decent bio of the band. It is not a great book and my main ciriticism is that the text often drags and rambles its way thru the book. The editor shoold have structured this a little bit better ad a smoother read.Photos shouls have been more conclusive as well.
4,Some Closure to A Great Singer's End,"I got the paperback edition of this. This is an easy to read book on INXS - it doesn't go into too much depth, but it gives the reader just enough detail of the band's raucous, heady rise to fame. I appreciate the band's honesty about the drugs they took - but most of all, it provides some insight and closure to the mysterious events surrounding Michael Hutchence's decline after the band's meteoric rise. An accident that triggered a change in events that led to Hutchence's instability and emotional downfall. Not a great end to one of rock's greatest frontmen - Hutchence's death will remain a series of What ifs, what could have been, and so on, but this book aims to be a simple memoir and celebration of the life of the band."
2,Not what I expected,"Must admit I was very disapointed with the book. The book does not really say much. There is no inside the INXS camp, just a odd story here and there about the band. They seem to miss all the facts. You would learn more about INXS in a behind the Music one hour special than in this book.Its seems it is more concerend about the scene in the 80s and the local band, tax laws, what they had to dinner yawn, yawn.All we wanted was there side of the story and sadley it missed all these points."
5,Showing Our True Colors,"Mary Miscisin's book was outstanding! It was a fun and easy read, yet full of informative and interesting ideas about people and how and why they act the way they do. Having been an educator for many years, this is THE book I could have used long ago to better interact with my students and their parents. The book's content makes easy what Myers-Briggs tries to do. I would recommend it to anyone who has a desire to deal more effectively with children or adults."
5,Showing Your True Colors,"Fantastic!! Best personality coding book I have ever read!! Easy to understand and reads very quickly! She explains the different personalities using the color coding system of Blue, Green, Gold, Orange, with each color representing a different dominent personality. Easy to understand and to incorporate into everyday life. The example stories she gives in the book are fun to read and put it in the most simple form for relating to each personality. I found myself viewing people differently, in a more positive way, and figuring out just which color they would fall under. I work in a customer service business, and found the information in the book, helped me understand my co-workers as well as my customers much better!! Wonderful and motivational. Great reading for everyone especially if you are in contact with the general public or work in a large office. Highly recommend for everyone!!"
1,Let's restore america by making everyone with an over-inflated sense of entitlement!,"This book provides no detail on realistic customer service. As someone who has actually worked retail in my life, I can tell you... This book only encourages a sense of entitlement among those who read it. It's an instruction manual for those who wish to whine, cry, yell, scream, abuse employees and in general throw a tantrum to get what they want.I've always been taught to treat others how you wish to be treated. From experience, being kind, respectful, and understanding is far more likely to get rules bent for you as well as have staff actually enjoy and look forward to your presence. There's a saying: You're more likely to catch flies with honey than vinegar. This book promotes only vinegar.Personally? If you thrust your hand in a ""c"" at me, I'm calling the cops to have you hauled away for a psych eval."
4,"Don't be a victim, get the service you deserve!","Just a great book on giving and getting quality customer service!""tell them what you want, how you want it and make sure they do it just that way"""
1,Read this book with an open mind,"Glen spends a lot of time in his book promoting the notion that everyone is entitled to have their egos stroked and that they are to be constantly reminded that they are the most important people in the world. This is nonsense, people are not entitled to such vanity. It is typical of the yuppie-me first mentality which permeates society today. Glen fails to take into consideration the low wages of people who provide the services today. He also fails to note that you get what you paid for, and since I bought his book in a clearance rack, I sure got what I paid for."
4,New look,I found this dvd to be entertaining and informative. I like that Nelly and his trainer can give me some more insight as it pertains to my workout. Looking forward to viewing the other celebs in this series - everyone has a fresh approach to the old routines.
4,DVD/CD assisted me,I am a 70 year old man who could never learn much about my camera. I watched this CD/DVD the other day. I am learning more each time I watch it. I am a slow learner when it comes to electronics or reading directions solo.This DVD goes slow enough for me and I pause it when I am holding the camera to lractice my lessons. I am taking pictures of things in the house and outside. The lessons here are making camera use easy for me. It is bacid lessons and the dials on my camera are more familiar to me. They should have this with every camera instead of written instructions.
4,Very refreshing,"That's really the best way I can describe it.I've seen it twice, and I think it is very entertaining. I personally don't find it gut-busting funny, but I didn't really stop laughing much either. It took me up a little bit, and set the cruise control. In that respect, it didn't really slow down at all.Because of that, I feel it was very well written, filmed, and directed. An excellent cast of actors that took to their roles flawlessly. I can't say enough good things about the acting/characters.It's not some extravagant fantasy tale that takes you on a whirlwind. It's a fresh story that is mostly realistic. There are some quirky twists and suspenses that may not leave you on the edge of your seat, but the way things come together is very enjoyable."
5,Very funny film from Pete Schwaba,"I'll keep it simple: this film is funny. If you're in the mood for some solid blue collar comedy, you will thoroughly enjoy this film. GODFATHER packed houses all over the Midwest during its theatrical run and was standing-room-only when we screened it at The Midwest Independent Film Festival. The feature went on to win Best Comedy at our 2005 Best of the Midwest Awards. Well-crafted comedies that keep you laughing from start to finish are hard to come by and GODFATHER is one of them. Enjoy!Mike McNamaraDirector of ProgrammingThe Midwest Independent Film Festival"
3,Cheesehead chatter,"I was born and lived on the West Bank of Green Bay for 26 years.Yes, the people and accents are funny, but where is Green Bay?I like film, it pokes great fun at us, but it does not show you the true beauty of the area."
2,Casting not believable,"Though this little indie has its moments, the flaws are too deep to overlook. The ex-high school teacher, for example, looks about 10 years younger than the former 'students' who supposedly turn up in Green Bay and rediscover her. The godfather character's mullet looks too obviously glued on. And the Mafia bad guy sent to rough up the godfather looks too youthful to be a vicious hatchetman. The script is just ok, and the comedian sequences on-stage have some veritude. Watch if there's nothing else."
3,A solid effort--held my interest,"Jerry B. Jenkins is one of the best known Christian writers out there today, and here he writes a novel with an earthy and real premise of a dying factory town and a dying high school and football team. Having lived at least some of my life in the deep south, most of the characters seemed real, although others, like Coach Schuler, seemed a bit too unrealistic to me, especially in some of the ways he treats his football team. Overall, however, this book was a good effort, teaches good values, had a good lesson, and held my interest throughout."
1,Unbelievably awful,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The plot--town fallen on hard times, star coach comes out of retirement to save school and spirit--is the very definition of cliche, and the entire book is basically an excuse for Jenkins to proselytize about the saving powers of Christianity. I knew it was going to be bad when I saw the blurb (from the highly esteemed literary review Sports Illustrated!) on the back cover: ""Reading this book is like listening to a good country song."" Bleagh. The writing is so bad, the messages so offensive (you're a coward if you don't fight, the three important things in life are God, cattle, and football, etc) that I could barely force myself to keep reading."
3,OK but wrong shape,"I had assumed these would be shaped like rods to enable a baby to easily hold them - they are in fact shaped like regular cookies, two inches in diameter, and our grandson is still unable to grasp them. Their content seems to be fine, but until his fine-motor skills improve they won't be very helpful."
2,Daddy cool is not that cool Moivie,"Daddy Cool 2009 Review :1. It is a remake of the British comedy ""Death at Funeral""2. It is about the mix ups and chaos which happens at the funeral .3. Javed Jaffrey is good but more is expected out of him . Aftab shivdesani was good too. Rajpal Yadav didn't had much room to show his talent .4. the final speech given by Sunil shetty is not that powerful .5. there are some funny moments in the movie which will make you laugh.6. Good thing that the movie doesnt have songs . There are only 2 songs ( one is the opening number and the other at the end of the movie)7. Overall a O.k movie . Not a Second time watch ."
3,No subtitles = major issue,"I love Sunil Shetty in comedies and was happy to see that he was lead actor for a remake of one of my most fave Brit comedies ""Death at a Funeral"". So I was looking forward to this film. Sadly, there is NO subtitling at all on this DVD and I don't speak Hindi. Major, major bummer. It is pretty much a scene-by-scene replay of all 3 previous versions so I was more than able to follow the plot and action. But still, I want to see this film with subtitles in English but until then, I will not buy this DVD."
2,NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES,"As another reviewer mentioned, this is basically a scene by scene remake of the English film 'Death at a Funeral', recently ALSO remade with an all African American cast. However, even though it SAYS it has English subtitles on the box...it DOESN'T...so unless you are fluent in Hindi... it is gonna be a waste of time to try to watch this..."
2,Mixed up track listing,"This CD lists tracks in a wrong order in the booklet and on the cover. Track 4 is not Symphonic Trumpets, but Marche Slave. Being not familiar with every work included on the CD, I could not restore the track listing myself. I've emailed Yedang requesting a correct track listing one week ago, but have not received any reply.Marche Slave included on this CD is a Soviet version. The melody of ""God Save the Tsar"" originally used by Tchaikovsky three times through the march was replaced by the melody of choir ""Glory"" by Glinka in this performance."
5,THE REAL ARTIST,"One can listen and feel the magic of the Filmore East performance Eddie Kramer captured on tape. I've seen video clips and Jimi and his fender are one in the same. Without a doubt, a brilliant and emotional composer and guitar player who let it all hang out and gave it all to us. An album to enjoy and go back to forever. I have the original album, the cd, and the music is as vibrant and relevant now as it was then. A must own. Machine Gun is so far out there it can't be caught - ever."
5,Outstanding!,"I don't have anything to add over the prior reviews, but this is really one of the best albums ever made. If you're thinking of getting it, go ahead. You won't regret it."
4,Roots rock,"Thankfully Hendrix captured his brief stint with a more homegrown blues-rock pair in this 1970 New Year's concert slice. It starts out a little unbalanced, which is to say that the first two songs seem to always dominate the mix, cutting through any fat, right to the purity of an unhinged solo. Despite that, the less jam oriented, though equally funky majority reveals a worthy vocalist in Miles and tight southern rock which unabashedly rocks to a demographic marketing restrictions would have excluded prior."
4,A great work by a legend,This purchase was a great buy for a product that came out when I was a teenager. The CD was in great shape and I am still blasting this music today.
5,"Essential yet, incomplete","No need to further garner praise for the performance here, just a gripe that the domestic version never included the tracks STOP or FOXEY LADY from the perfomance (they were available on the import version)...pity, as they both contibute much to the Hendrix canon and should not be kept from eager ears."
5,air-raid siren chords!,"this album is the best live album ever, and it has the most amazing guitar playing of any album , live or not, ever... including jimi's other albums. This seems to be jimi's underground(it was the last one i heard about)and has a free kind of newness about it. i've never heard anyone cover any of these songs cause no-one can! Ive never heard a guitar sound more primal, organic and expressive.Listening to this album is a similar experience to listening to modern jazz like coltrane and miles davis etc, because 'pop' is out the window for one thing, coltrane etc trancended jazz into their own primal expression, just like hendrix does with popular rock. All the songs last at least 5 minutes with machine gun going up to over 12 minutes of inspired improvisation."
3,Jimi Hendrix without the Experience,"When you are listening to this, you come to the conclusion that :1) Noel Redding was a very underrated bassist.2) as we know, Mitch Mitchell was indipensable to the Jimi Hendrix' music.this new band was not good, Buddy Miles is lousy as drummer and i don't like the liquid bass of Billy Cox ; the rhythm section is important in a band, this is not only the guitarist and the front man who makes the sound ; in short, this record is way inferior to the first three albums."
3,Good but not great,"Jimi has some fantastic playing on this cd, especially on Machine Gun, Power to Love, and Message to Love, but Buddy Miles really has a annoying drumming style and voice. He ruins Who Knows with his horrible vocal solo and tries to ruin all of the other Hendrix tunes. I also feel Buddy's ""Changes"" is a very overrated song, and ""Live Together"" is not very good either. If Buddy Miles was Mitch Mitchell then this would be a classic. Billy Cox and Hendrix are in very good form though. For the bass and guitar it is a good buy."
3,Not his best.......,"I love Hendirx but not this CD, even though I have it, I rarely listen to it. I really dont think he was palying his best music at this time, too much pressure from all the people around him and record companies wanting albums from him, the man was doing heroin too.... his mind was really going in circles trying to please everybody... what a waste of talent to die so young, his best work was behind him I think, he was pushed in the wrong direction... too bad, best guitarest EVER by far...."
5,Hendrix--Naked--No Frills--Just Chills,This is the consumate concert of Jimi Hendrix just playing his quitar live with two 'in the pocket' musicians--Billy Cox and Buddy Miles. There's no overdubs--No studio tricks--It's just live with Jimi at his most coherent and argueably 'in the moment' performance ever captured for your 'Ear Goggles'. The anti-war sentiment in 'Machine Gun' rings true now as it did then and is worth the price of admission alone. Not for when the party is at it's peak but for when the herd thins out and the sun's coming up. Enjoy.
5,ONE OF THE BEST LIVE ALUBUMS EVER,"This cd is a ""must have"". Jimi sounds amazeing, with his band, Band of Gypsys, better than his old band Jimi Hendrix Exsperince. His guitar playing is his best. His voice is deep and soulful. Also singing is the drummer Buddy Miles. Their vocies make this cd come alive. Some good tracks are 1 ""Who Knows"" 2 ""Machine gun"" 4 ""Power to Love"" 6 ""We Gotta Live Together"". The only other artist now adays that sounds a little like the god of guitar is Lenny Kravitz. If you are a Hendrix fan YOU MUST GET THIS CD."
1,Snoooooooooooooooooooooooozzzzzzzzzzzzzzeeeeeeeeeeeee,"Boring - just boring. Funkadelic were already blowing this guy away at this stage. Buy their cds instead, you'll find more going on for sure."
2,Overrated by the other reviewers,"I don't hate this album. But in comparison to songwriting and perfomances of the 3 albums which he put out with the Jimmy Hendrix Experience, this album just doesn't cut it. If one is to buy their first Hendrix album, buy the first album or Axis: Bold as Love. Then if one likes those albums, proceed to the wonderful Electric Ladyland."
2,Hendrix at his worst,Do not get band of gypses. Hendrix must've been stoned out of his brain on this. The whole album sounds like schreeching tyres.
4,Hendrix Gets Funky!,"Completely different band line up than the previous 3 studio albums. WAY funkier! Recorded mostly live so there is some noise, but overall I'd say this is one of my favorite Hendrix albums."
5,pure Hendrix,"groovy,basic hendrix music. check ""Who knows"" out..it's a gem..and good luck try'in to get THIS riff Outta your mind! this record must be played LOUD. Definetely! Take it from me. Stefan"
5,Great Album,This is an awesome live album. Hendrix and Buddy Miles were really good together and Jimi was excellent in this more bluesy than pop musical form.
5,Don't miss this!!!!,"If you like Hendrix or just like classic rock guitar this is a MUST HAVE for any serious collection. Excellent live performance, strong display of why he is still so famous to this day."
5,POWER OF SOUL INDEED!,"A high school buddy turned me on to this when it came out on vinyl and it remains a favorite Hendrix recording of mine. It's funky and it rocks. Sure, Mitch Mitchell might be a better drummer than Miles but Buddy's in the pocket groove is what Jimi needed on this disc and it meshes beautifully with Cox's funky bass playing.The track 'Machine Gun' is a tour de force of guitar playing. Only Jimi could pull off something like this. I love Mitch Mitchell's drumming but Buddy's backbeat really holds things down beautifully. The beginning of 'Power To Love' is pure Hendrix.This is probably my favorite 'air guitar' CD. It is no mistake that some of the best and most well known guitar players continue to cite Jimi as an influence. He was ahead of his time. I can't say this is his best recording but for me it's one of my favorites and will remain so. JIMI FOREVER FOREVER JIMIwww.electriceyes.us"
5,Traveling the speed of the reborn man!,"If you've heard the album/CD, you get the title. This is the closest thing to an excellent recorded jam session that you can find from that era. Hendrix, Miles, and Cox were THE supergroup, LATER for Cream and Little Feat! They play off of each other quite nicely on ""Power of Love,"" ""Message to Love,"" ""Who Knows,"" and of course, ""Machine Gun."" Sad that James Marshall Hendrix died so soon after this. But it's a blessing that he was around long enough to record this rock/soul masterpiece."
5,one of the greatest rock albums of all time,"I first listened to the album a few years ago. It knocked my soxs off. It still does, theere isn't a bad song it. you'll love jimi's solos too. I rate this album as good as KISS ALIVE, it would be better if it were a bit longer. from the first song to the last song not a boring moment. I don't know what else to say. BUY this album if you can. I have it on vinly, but not on cd. Oh yeah, none of these songs are on any studio album, that is another attribute for this accomplishment"
4,A good Live document of Hendrix in action,"This is a New Year's Eve live recording Jimi did with his ad hoc group ""A Band of Gypsys."" The songs are aren't nearly as good as the stuff that you'll find on Jimi's three studio albums, and the rhythm section is nowhere near as good as the Experience was, but it showcases his mighty guitar work and has a couple of gems (""Machine Gun"" is an awesome guitar workout). But although this is worth owning, it is not what I would term a ""must-buy."""
3,Definitely Not His Best Release,"Typically people recommend this album for ""Machine Gun"". From a guitarist's point of view, I think ""Message of Love"" has two of the most consistent and best live guitar solos ever played by Jimi Hendrix. His guitar tone morphs into different sounds without any studio gimmics and his playing is clearly inspired without his usual tuning problems. Buddy Miles is merely a competent drummer, but he ain't no Mitch Mitchell. Billy Cox however, is a different story. His bass playing fits Hendrix's music like a glove."
5,Essential music,"One of the heaviest live recordings ever.Thats not to say it is the heaviest live performance ever.If everything with Jimi had been decently recorded,we might have had ten years more of music to light up our hearts with.Whats produced now in music is so bad it is dangerous,even.Sports gets its share,because it makes people feel that they can cooperate and do what they really want,and maybe get famous,but music is just treated like some product.Everyone is not an athlete,some have other talents."
5,JIMI HENDRIX- Band of Gypsys,"One of the greatest, if not the greatest Hendrix albums! Who Knows and Machine Gun are 2 of his greatest songs. Musically this is his best album. All his live albums are great, but his guitar work on this album, especially Machine Gun is magical! Buddy Miles and Billy Cox are far more better musicians than the Experience. Jimi, Buddy, and Billy just ""click"". Jimi Hendrix is and will always be the greatest guitarist! I highly recommend this album."
4,Jimi Hendrix - 'Band Of Gypsys' (Capitol),"I remember when this lp first came out;my baby-sitter used to play it on the stereo all the time.So nice to hear it mastered on CD.'Band Of Gypsys' is a 6 song/45 minute live performance that was recorded on New Year's Eve 1969-70.It's line-up is not to be missed:Hendrix on guitar&vocals,Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on drums.I specially dug ""Who Knows"",the nicely flowing ""Power Of Love"",and the two Miles compositions ""Changes"" and ""We Gotta Live Together"".If anything,this disc PROVES there'll never be another Hendrix.A really memorable listening experience."
5,30 years of Hendrix making his guitar talk,"Band of Gypsies was one of my first music albums. I was a junior in high school and received it as a gift. It has been one of my favorites ever since. Thirty years later, I am now a 45 year old who is still be amazed that only three guys can put out such incredible jams. My album is worn out, my son long since has destoyed my turntable, my cassette copy of the album is fading so I eagarly await this CD. This recording is timeless!"
5,...this show is a MASTERPIECE!,"Band of Gypsies was Hendrix's last project before his death. With the Gypsies, Jimi was striving for a more straight ahead blues-rock sound, and he found it. Although I love everything that the man recorded, this live show at the Fillmore East is Hendrix at his finest musical hour! Enjoy."
4,Some Mixed Feelings,"This is a tough one for me, as I LOVE what Jimi was doing on here playing-wise, his usual brilliance and bluesiness in full bloom. Yet something wasn't completely right.For me, the fault lay in the rhythm section or at least 1/2 of it, namely Buddy Miles. Between his mediocre vocals and even more mediocre hamfisted and extremely limited drumming, it kept this set from being the masterpiece I think Jimi wanted it to be. If only the fluid and far more talented Mitch Mitchell was on hand for this, it would've rated 5-stars for me no problem.But,, the Buddy Miles problem aside, there is still plenty of brilliance and fireworks to be enjoyed from Jimi as he coaxes all manner of sounds from his Stratocaster and musically lays his heartt out in full view. No matter what, he sang and played with so much heart and adventure."
1,Not quite,"Well, this book doesn't really work too well on homosexual men. In fact, it is quite depressing and makes you feel incredibly invaluable and not human."
3,The original crock pot cookbook,My wife wore the original out- this is the same exact book. There are a few good recipes in it.
3,This isn't everything.....,"I'm the most die-hard Heavy Pettin fan that I know, and the stuff on this box set is top-notch. But most or all of it has been released before. My biggest gripe is the omission of anything from ""Big Bang"", which for many fans was their best, and one of my top 10 cds of all time. The problem is those in and around the band keep referring to that cd as a mistake or that their sound was forced by others in the business and not the direction they wanted to go. Well they went there, and it is a big part of true ""Pettology"" and deserved to be on this box set, especially now that you can't easily get ""Big Bang"" on cd. For those that don't own the first two cds, I would highly suggest to get this set."
2,I judged this book by its cover..,and what I thought would be a fun a collection of nonfiction essays--not much substance to the essays..fell short of my expectations.
5,Very Pleased,"I bought these to finish off the Pinzon hope chest collection for my daughter. They are of excellent quality and make for a great starter set. Solid quality, nice weight to them but not too heavy like a stoneware. You can dress these dishes up according to the occasion or use for everyday."
2,So Disappointing,"So much potential, so disappointing. It's basically elevator music, and a waste of Queen Latifah's wonderful talent."
3,Another Christmas present....,"I bought this album for my Dad for Christmas, I haven't heard it, so I don't know if it's any good."
5,"Beautiful music, Beautiful Lady, Great CD!","Wow, can she sing! I can only imagine how large her catalog would be if she had only sung jazz & standards from the beginning. What a Beautiful voice, a Great beauty!"
4,Enjoyed this Album,"I thought she had a great voice when she sang on ""Living Single"" and waited for her to release her non-rap albums. Both this one and ""The Dana Owens Album' were nominated for a Grammy and are very well deserved."
3,Beautiful Voice,"Queen Latifah has a beautiful voice, and this album showcases it well. she's at her best when she gives pop or jazz songs a new twist, as she did with ""California Dreamin'"" on her previous album. ""Poetry Man"" works here, as does the title song (though she lacks the poignancy of Billie Holiday). A few songs veer into torch ballads that are a little much, but overall those who liked the Dana Owens album will like this, too."
4,Easy listening,"I first heard this at the place I get my hair cut. I really liked the mix of jazz and easy listening, so I ordered it as soon as I got home. It's really great to have it in the background when I'm cooking or reading."
5,Trav'lin Light CD,This CD is very good. I thought I was ordering the audio book under the same name but was surprised when I received the CD. I was going to return it but liked it so much kept it.
3,Not as strong as Dana Owens album,"Some nice tracks here, but mostly a pale comparison of her Dana Owens album. I didn't follow her rap career before this. Favorites: Poetry Man and I'm Gonna Live Till I Die.I bought this album based on the 30-sec preview of I'm Not In Love. Unfortunately, the entire song itself turned out to be a disappointment."
5,The Queen Rules!,"I am a big Queen Latifah fan she is so multi talented and beautiful. Love the selection of tunes, the vocal styling, and the musicians. The arrangements are excellent. Props to the engineers. A sumptuous aural feast."
2,Trav'lin Light,"Queen Latifa has a great voice and I bought this CD mainly for the first song, Poetry Man. That song is a real catcher and done very well. The rest of the CD is very average."
5,TRAV'LIN' LIGHT,ALL HAIL TO THE QUEEN IS ALL I CAN SAY! ME BEING 23 AND NEVER REALLY HEARING MEANING OF THESE SONGS THE QUEEN IS TRULY MAKING ME RESPECT THIS GENRE OF MUSIC HER SOULTRY VOCALS AND CLARITY IS SOMETHING VERY RARE 2DAY IN THE MUSIC WORLD GO GET THE CD ITS A CLASSIC
2,it's ok,"i respect and dig Queen Latifah overall for still keeping her thing going for twenty years. but the singing route to me feels more like a Novelty. she has some good arrangements and Production,but her voice and personality just never ever set anything in motion for me at all. i don't mind her singing a jingle or something,but a whole album is a bit much because while she has some tone as a Singer, she is missing that feeling of expression as a Songstress that leaves a impression.Latifah has always left a strong impression on me for her overall versatilty,but the singing element ain't happening for me on a whole beyond a few songs."
1,Not great!,"So glad that we can listen to the songs somewhat before we buy the cd. I think Queen Latifah is great at many things, but singing jazz is not one of them.Here she takes on a few jazz standards, but she doesn't bring anything new and fresh to them. Each song sounds the same to me. I hate that on any cd especially jazz. Seriously, if you are going to perform jazz standards or things that have been done before you need bring something different to the mix. Otherwise why would I want to listen to something that has been done many many times over, by folks with better voices?"
3,pretty good,"Some of the songs I like and some I didn't like at all, I gave it to a friend. I don't like having to skip songs on a CD. But my friend likes all of them. Queen L's voice is spectacular, I love the jazzy, and blues type songs she does. I just was not fond of all the songs on this CD."
3,Disappointed,The Queen has a great voice but not style. Would I buy another recording? Only if I listened very carefully before making the purchase.This fails in my cateogory of Jazz.
5,poetry man,enjoy this cd. didn't care much about queen latifah as a singer. don't like rap music at all. this cd i believe is the best ever that she had ever sang. if she continues with this kind of music she will go far. I really enjoy this cd.
5,Queen can really sing!,"Queen Latifah is a pleasant surprise on this release, ESPECIALLY the cover of the Pointer Sisters' How Long (Betcha' gotta a chick on the side) simply amazing singing!"
4,Classy!,"I am so proud of Queen Latifah, she has truly grown as an artist. This is an album that you can listen to over and over, in the office, in the car, on a Saturday morning while doing laundry and on a Friday night while making love. Grammy nods to her! Any true music lover will not be disappointed."
5,a voice like silk,"there are many versions of these particular selections out there, but the queen makes them all sound brand new."
2,Her Voice is a beautiful as Ever. Song selection is bland.,"I loved Latifah's last offering. Her future is clearly in song and not hip-hop. That said, This album seems quite bland. While her voice will impress even the most staunch Jazz purists. Her song selection lacked the same ""fire"" The Dana Owens Album had. Perhaps, being 38 not 58 has something to do with my feeling like the song selection is lacking. But, my thought is that most of the people who are listening to Latifah are closer to my age. She preforms so well vocally that she deserves another CD but based on the song selection --I do not see this album doing well enough to warrant her getting another album. That would be a shame.Long live the Queen."
4,Classic album by a classic artist!!,"All hail the Queen! Latifah has scored again with a classic example of greater things to come. If ever a film is shot based on the life of Pearl Bailey, Latifah will be cast. Remember, you read it here first."
1,poor quality and lousy service,"No response after repeated e-mails regarding quality of merchandise and the response about not receiving it in a timely fashion was that they were having trouble getting it from the manufacturer. In other words they were selling an item they didn't even have, and it was of sub-optimal quality. The 25 yard roll was actually several smaller lengths which raised my cost per item for resale, and some of the pieces had large holes and runs in them making them entirely unusable. I will not buy from this company again.....there are far more reputable sellers out there who sell what they advertise and stand behind their product."
4,Healthy,"The plants I received are very healthy, but they are only 6 - 8 inches tall by 6-8 inches wide. These plants are hard to find in SW Alabama; even though they are native. I think they are overpriced after shipping charges are applied."
5,"Pet Shop Boys Perfect, actually","The pet shop boys achieve perfection on their 4th studio effort ""behaviour."" While many fans hold ""Very"" to be the boys best album, it is ""behaviour"" that pulls together every aspect of the duo's irony, wit, and sophistication. The overall mood of the album is somber but in classic PSB fashion the backdrop is still clubland. On the opening (and finest) track ""being boring"" Neil Tennant sings a semi-autobiographical tale about coming of age, the dreams of youth, and how things turn out- all set to a 4/4 disco beat. Other stand-out tracks include the strings & shuffle-beat heavy ""my October Symphony""-a personal favourite of Guns'n'Roses frontman Axel Rose and the inspiration behind their hit ""November Rain"", the dance/pop ""the end of the world"" and the hauntingly quiet ""in the wind."" Behaviour is an ESSENTIAL album to any collection and one which showcases both brilliant songwriting and pop sensabilities. You'll regret passing it up!"
5,"As a fan, I consider this ""Simply the Best""","This album is the best pet shop boys cd, period. Before this album, my favorite was ""Introspective"", but I must say the writing and music on this cd surpass most of their previous and later material. A must have!"
5,the beginning of the end,"Probably the album where the PSBs stopped writing songs about what will happen and started writing songs about what has happened, or what could have happened. The critics will still probably call this the PSB's best album (my fave is still Please). And it has its highpoints. But it can make you feel unhappy. Which is probably what makes it such a great album. I love Being Boring (kind of acid-jazzy) and So Hard (very late-80s club a la Anything Box, Red Flag or Camouflage). The PSB version of Where The Streets Have No Name was also released as part of this album but, like Always On My Mind and Somewhere, is not actually on the album. This album was supported by the PSB's one and only US tour. I saw them in LA and my brother and I snuck up to better seats and sat next to the two worst thirds of Wilson-Phillips."
2,"""Being Boring"" says it all","The Pet Shop Boys tweak their sound a bit here, bringing in an orchestra for a few songs and giving the guitars more prominence. But they don't seem to have had much fun doing it. The end result is an album that's far more impressive than involving. With the exception of ""Being Boring,"" a beautifully understated pop song, the Boys always sound as if they're holding something back. Even ""How Can You Expect To Be Taken Seriously"" sounds timid, despite the introduction of power chords. Superior versions of ""Being Boring"" and ""Jealousy"" can be found on ""Discography,"" so start there."
5,Magnificent pop music.,"Tennant and Lowe, the Rodgers and Hart of modern pop music, made their break from Great Singles Band to Great Album Band with 1990's ""Behavior,"" their most mature, consistent set to date. Ten songs that range from moody, atmospheric ballads (""Jealousy"" and the poignant ""To Face the Truth"") to more upbeat, yet still bittersweet dance-oriented tracks (""How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?"" and ""So Hard""), ""Behavior"" shows one of pop music's finest songwriting partnerships at their creative peak. At its heart, however, ""Behavior"" is a profoundly somber reflection on fame, loneliness, relationships and AIDS. Occasionally optimism shines through the dark, pessimistic soundscapes, but ""Behavior"" remains one of the definitive albums for the lovelorn. Tennant and Lowe played it more lighthearted on 1993's overrated (but still good) ""Very"" and 1996's ""Bilingual"" (perhaps their finest album), but they never again captured the wistful, touching vibe of ""Behavior."""
5,One of the best,"When I bought this CD at first, I didn't pay much attention to it .. but after hearing it over and over, I have grown much appreciation for what this CD brings .. It's one of the best from PSB, I think it's definitely better than Nightlife, not by much though ... The best song of course is ""JEALOUSY"", and It alone justifying buying this CD at $10"
4,nice and cheesy,"Sister Elizabeth Donderdock is unappreciated in her Squeamish township. (So as not to offend the Amish, the Sedarises replaced the ""A"" with ""Squea"". I'm sure no one suspects.) She is the only person who has the secret touch it takes to make the famous Squeamish cheese balls, but the town doesn't realize how important she is until she disappears. Although not David's best work, this play is a lot of fun to read and features a lot of good-natured silliness. On the otherhand, it appears difficult to stage. Make sure you have four good actors who can play male and female roles, Amish as well as alcoholic and can speak Ukranian."
2,not up to the typical sedaris level,"I totally love both Amy and David Sedaris, but I have to say this was very disappointing, I'm not even sure why they published this. It seems like it would be the kind of thing you would put together just for family members who were there, get it and love whatever you do because you are family. I would caution anyone else from purchasing this."
2,Not what I expected,"I should have shopped more carefully - I just want to read everything David Sedaris has written. This is a 50-page play, which is entertaining and would be great, if it was longer and more detailed. It's super-condensed."
3,"Good, but not David.","This book is small, don't be fooled. It is way shorter than I expected, it is ONE short story, that's it. It has some funny moments but does not create the same sparks that David Sedaris creates in his text."
5,Why bother anymore with that cloying elf?,"...and his fatuous harpy of a sister...This guy has pulled eight sheeps of wool over way too many eyes. Let's take him, Eggers, Squeaky Vowell, Frangenides, and all the other ersatz nutz (a phrase which might inspire peals of squeals and subsequent chapters for any of these Supersponges) and write them out of their own self-suckling fables. This is Seinfeld without the neuroses, Pynchon without the mystery, Modernism without the resonance or wit...just a mess of weak minds and quirks masquerading as Personality."
1,Not worth the wait,"I'm an ex-pat currently living in Mexico. After waiting a long time for this product I finally bought it through Amazon while vacationing in the U.S. The case looks good and the camera fits well, but durability is non-existent. One of the seams ripped open, but not before I had finished my vacation and returned home to Mexico. I have owned it for a total of 4 weeks. I'd send it back, but it would probably cost more than the original purchase price."
4,Pretty good,She does a good job of explaining PPD and capturing her experience in print. I thought the last few chapters could have been shortened and the same message would gave gotten across. But overall well done and a quick read.
4,Brooke holds no Shields,"A very honest and open account of not only Post-Partum Depression but also a genuine account of the strong love and bond between mother and child. An easy read, one that will keep your interest and leave you with hope and gratitude. There are details about Brooke's miscarriage and also her valiant efforts to get pregnant as well. I would recommend this book."
4,Very informative--definitely helpful for those suffering,"I am new graduate nurse and am interested in eventually pursuing a career in women's health nursing--after I gain some experience in general medical-surgical nursing. This book opened my eyes to a whole new side of postpartum depression and how all women deal with it in different ways. Brooke Shields makes it okay for women to speak out about their feelings after delivering, even if they're not the typical ""happy new mother"" feelings. I highly recommend this book to any women who are pregnant or soon plan to become pregnant so that you are aware of things to look for and realize that it's okay to ask for help."
1,Seeing the truth,"So many millions of women suffer PPD. In fact depression is a very wide-spread problem in today's competitive society made only worse by the difficult economy we live in. So what makes Brooke Shields so special? Nothing. In fact with all her wealth she can get the therapy and support she needs that MILLIONS of others can never get. It's easy to go tell other people to go get help when you haven't a clue what it's like to not have the money to pay for it. Due to her lack of talent Brooke Shields has struggled greatly to not be just a has-been. She's a former child star who's famous for just being who she is. I felt this book was an attempt to stay famous just like all her constant announcements of her virginity did. When she got too old to continue lying about her virginal status (and there's no question anymore that she did lie about it), she had to find something else. If she didn't she and her horrible movies would have been long forgotten now."
1,Lost,"After reading some of the reviews it is clear to me that many people who ""like the book"" are simply star-struck over Brooke Shields. Post Partum Depression is too important and serious of a subject to be literally exploited to bring publicity back to someone whose career is lost. Brooke's lack of talent and fading of her once incredibly photogeic beauty, has caused her to use her past PPD to up her career. I believe this because of her remark of how she'll forgive Tom Cruise if he comes and sees her in a play in England. The remark was very inappropriate and off the subject. It was made to promote her play and to make it look like her work is in the same category as Cruise's, which of course is rediculous.All this is a shame because the book could have brought a lot of intelligent debate over PPD, cures, causes, treatments, etc. Instead, look at what's going on in the media."
1,This book was not written for the right reasons.,"I heard about this book on TV so when I was at the bookstore I checked it out. I was immediately surprised at the book. The first thing I saw was the cover of the book being completely taken up by Brooke Shields' face. Then I spent some time reading it and the inside was very similar to the cover. If Shields did write this book to help other women like she claims, the cover and the content of the book wouldn't be all about her like it is. Then a couple days ago I saw Shields on TV again promoting her book. This time she was holding up her book for everyone to see all the while walking and posing like a supermodel on a runway. I was digusted. There's no question she wrote this book to bring herself back into the spotlight."
3,Down comes the regret,"It sounds like this disorder may be more about regret about parenthood than depression. If the kid was so wanted why did it cause so much turmoil? I have a feeling that since women are told they want babies many women fall for it, and realize they do not and that reality hits them only after it is too late. So in order to not get crucified by a society who hates a woman who wants the freedom of being without children they invent this syndrome, blame hormones wildly out of conrol, to avoid being burnt at the stake socially rather than admit that a child can be a 100% life mistake for some. The unconscious can be deep and unless you really look at it you can end up like this woman and a lot of others. The women accept the children because what else can they do. As the saying goes ""If you bought into something pricey that you can't refund, you'd better be enthuiastic"" To bad that with all Brooke's money she didn't take the time to sit and figure this one out."
1,ENOUGH!,"How long does Shields plan on banking in on her PPD? I am so sick of hearing about it. Now a book with a different cover and title? Enough! I tired of Brooke Shields years ago when her movies kept getting worse and worse. Yes she is argueably one of the most beautiful women in the world, but she is also inargueably the worst actress ever. I'm amazed that Shields is willing to keep making more and more money from her PPD. Where's her embarrassment? I will believe that she wrote this book (and continues to promote it) simply to help other women, as soon as I hear about her donating all the money she's making to the cause. Til then I am so sick of hearing about Shields and can't wait til the media is tired of her again. Unfortunately her team of publicists will probably keep us suffering."
1,I'd rather smell diapers...,"than read the rest of this book. Despite her Princeton degree (which I think calls into question the caliber of the school), Brooke Shields has all the writing skill of the average 6 year-old. She is out of touch with the real world; she is a privileged, pampered, sniveling wench. Her complaints of powdery CLEAN diaper smell, having to take a crap, and having to be cleaned by a nurse because she was too damn lazy to take care of herself, all smacks of ego and elitism. I wish she had jumped out of the window, or swallowed the bottle of pills than taken taken pen to paper. I want my money back as I couldn't stomach one more chapter of this drivel.I will however keep it on my bookshelf, because whenever I do feel depressed, this book with indeed be the antidote. For THAT, I thank Brooke Shields. What a hilarious, mad-cap adventure it is!"
4,Courageous move by Brooke,"I grew up admiring Brooke Shields. She may not be a very talented actress, but when it comes to beauty she's in a league of her own. But what I really admire about her now is that she uses her fame to bring to light a very serious problem that a lot of people don't understand. While I disagree that PPD is something most people haven't heard about (think Andrea Yates and all the other news stories over the past few years), I do agree that the more light shown on PPD, the better. This book will help a lot of people understand how real PPD is."
5,"Thank you, Brooke!","All I can say is a big Thank You to Brooke! She captures in words what I could only sob through just a few months ago. She brings light to something that I felt to guilty for the first few months of my son's life. Despite a bit of public critisism, this book is just plain REAL. Brooke invites you into her life and reveals her own personal struggles in a real and touching way. I kept thinking, ""but this is BROOKE SHIELDS!"" and realizing that no one is above something like this.Thanks again, Brooke!!"
2,"Nice for most, not for the serious cases","My wife has PPD. Big time. Reading about Brooke's situation was at first a relief. But then she learned about Brooke's brief time on Pacsil and RELATIVELY short weeks with depression. We do not belittle her experience. PPD is a serious illness. But, Brooke's experience is minor league compared to my wife's battle. If your are struggling in a a more significant way, you should instead read ""Sleepless Days"" by Susan Kushner Resnick. True representation of hard core PPD. Again, I never take anything away from the women suffering from post partum. I'm just trying to give direction to those of you with the harder cases. By the way, my wife is doing sooooo much better!"
3,Just OK - not really that much on PPD,"It felt like the PPD was discussed very briefly and most of the book was her telling her story of how she grew up, how she wanted a baby, how hard it was to get there, how she missed her old life, how she then loved her baby, how cute her baby is, how she balanced her career and motherhood, her relationship with her mother, yada yada yada. I certainly wouldn't read this book to learn about PPD. It is just an easy read book if you are interested in looking into the lives of celebrities."
5,GREAT BOOK-THANKS BROOKE!,"I read this book in 1 day and it is by far the best book on the subject of PPD. Brooke Shields should be commended for writing such an honest account of what she had gone through. Having gone through PPD twice, I had all the same experiences and feelings as Brooke did (but could never express it as eloquently as she did in the book). I'm hoping that this book as well as Brooke speaking out more about PPD will open people's eyes more about this awful afflication and just how common it is. I plan to give this book to all my ""mom"" friends (many whom I sure will relate)."
2,A spark that failed to ignite a flame.,"I was diagnosed with PPD/OCD after having my first child and while I'm glad that there is someone out there using the media as a means to shed light on this topic, she lacked to fully articulate what it means to go through this. The whole book was her saying ""why me?? I don't understand, why me??""There are far better outlets on line that give women information and a network to support their efforts in fighting this battle. [...] is a great tool if connecting with women who are going through the same feelings and thoughts that you are, and it helps to realize that you are not alone.If you want to read someone else complain about why they are going through this, read it. However, if you're like me and want to find a book that relates to the real horrors we go through while dealing with this, pass, because this isn't it."
4,Down Came The Rain...,It's nice to hear someone famous be honest and open about Postpartum. My experience was similar in some ways but worse in others. I kept my scary thoughts in for 18 years . I have a new baby and as soon as I felt those old feelings I called my doctor instead of suffering like I did years ago. I bought this book to help me feel like someone that seem to be perfect could have the same feelings that I did. If you are suffering please get help.
2,OK...but...,"I am half way through and am getting a little bored actually. The writing is ok I guess, but I just feel like the same thing is being said over and over. I really do sympathize with Brooke, I really do. It's just that I'm not sure I can get through this book. I have a one yr old and after she was born I felt that I made a huge mistake and was feeling more irritated with her birth than happy. I had visions that I didn't even think I wanted her at all and thoughts of giving her up. I was clearly sleep deprived and depressed and after a short while, those feelings lifted and she became the love of my life. I could not imagine my life without her! So I guess I was expecting more from this book and for me, it just didn't deliver. But this topic is clearly a serious one and if a mom has it, it doesn't mean she's awful, just human!"
1,I'll pass,"Here we go again with Brooke Shields, another media hound looking for attention after she used Michael Jackson for that and realized even going out with him would not help her acting career. Anyway, I do believe women suffer for PPD and maybe some anti-depressants temporarily work for them. However, I think many of Brooke's issues were related to her advanced maternal age."
2,Truly unbelievable,"It should come as no surprise that she is suffering from depression. The root of MOST depressive states is a self-possessed mentality. This is a classic example. Being about ones self is DEPRESSING, and this story only details the story of WHY.Truly sickening, at a time when her baby needed her absolute love, attention, and devotion, Brooke was, as she has ALWAYS been, all about her poor little self. This is a perfect example of why most people should not have children: they lack the emotional maturity to actually CARE for someone.Do the kid a favor, find an adoptive parent that is up to the task of parenting."
1,I never ordered this,I don't know how this became part of my list. Because I never order this book.I never ordered it.
2,skeptical,"I thought the book was well written, but I was skeptical from beginning until end because of what I know about Brooke Shields. Some of you may remember that Brooke Shields claimed to be a virgin well into her adult years. I remember her on the Maury Povich show claiming to still be a virgin at the age of 27. Years later she fessed in an interview that her first time was actually at Princeton when she was 22 years old. Not that anyone really cares, but it was her who volunteered all this information.Then when her child was less that a month old, Brooke did a magazine article with photographs - in the article she claimed that having her daughter was the greatest joy she ever felt. This was when her child was less than a month old - so where was the postpartum depression at this time. Was it already over? It's just hard to know what to believe with this woman."
3,Let's get back on track,"I read this book and I learned more about depression - especially depression related to PPD. However I think this book is getting a lot of publicity based on fame and public arguing. Tom Cruise's statements about Brooke Shields wrongfully using anti-depressants may have been ignorant, but they've brought a lot of publicity to this book in the wrong way. Now Brooke Shields has said that if Tom Cruise comes to see her in Chicago, then she'll see him in War of the Worlds. Well that's like me telling a person who's far more successful than I am, ""If you let me drive your brand new Cadillac, I'll let you drive my Toyota."" Brooke Shields needs to let this book be important for what it is, and not use this opportunity to help her struggling career."
2,- IRRESPONSIBLE-,"Any thought to the child that would one day read that her mother hated her? Words hurt - and in my opinion will someday cause much more devestation for the daughter who reads of her mother's feelings towards her at birth.It is possible to approach post partum depression in a much more professional and less sensationalistic way that does not involve a direct attack against an innocent gift from God. By purchasing this book, I feel that I have somehow contributing to this child's future pain."
5,Thank you Brooke,So comforting knowing another mom's journey through postpartum. I found strength again by reading Brooke's story and other's like us. I would recommend this to any new mom.
4,"intense, but good","i found this book hard to put down. as someone who also suffered from PPD, i found it reassuring. glad i'm not the only one who had those thoughts."
2,Not helpful,"I bought this book to get some insight into a mom I know going through PPD. I had a hard time getting past the selfish, princess parts of her life even though she tried to say many times that she is not this type of person. She is not down to earth or relatable because she has access to help that everyday women do not. I do feel very badly for anyone who has to suffer through this and as a mom, I feel very thankful I didn't have to."
5,I Greatly Enjoyed Seeing Petra And Hearing Noah Hutchings On The Prophecy Regarding Petra,"This DVD made me want to jump in a plane and travel to Petra to see it in person. Fortunately, I have plans to do that and that's why I bought the video. There were some parts that just brought a smile to my face. One of them is when Dr. Noah Hutchings is shown sitting by a young boy out in the desert. The young boy says something to Noah and they both grin. It was real, not rehearsed.The more studious parts of the DVD were well done. I learned more in watching this DVD than I had previously in everything I've read. It also left me wanting to know still more, which is what I want when I study a topic.The video is definitely not a secular travel video, as the title indicates.I loved it!Comment"
2,Shallow,"This isn't what I hoped for or expected. I thought there would be archaeological, geologic and historical information, but virtually everything was how Petra fulfills some cryptic Biblical prophesy. Virtually all that was said about the city was that it was founded by Esau, according to the Bible, and somehow I doubted that he built/carved it all by himself. Who did it? Why go to all that hard work? Who lived there? Do we know any of this?The geology of the site is strange. According to this video, this is a volcanic outcropping, but the stones are sandstone, and sandstone is sedimentary, certainly not volcanic. There was obviously water here once, millions of years ago, to form the sandstone, and water to carve the weird shapes in it.In short, I came away knowing nothing concrete more than I knew before I spent an hour watching this."
3,It is an Okay DVD.,"This is an interesting DVD on Petra. For general use it is fine. However, for definitive use there were a few errors which I detected. The untrained viewer would not even notice them."
5,"Great Amazon Service, Wonderful Product","...The mailbox is very sturdy. We purchased this product because we have mail tampering in our neighborhood and have been paying for private mail service for business mail. We installed on 4x4 pole but 6x6 might work a tad better because the holes to attach were near the edge and we changed the location. It is a very tight fit, as previous review states the door is tight but it works very well and being this close fitting will keep out the weather. I think this mail box is a bargain compared to other security mail boxes. It is strange appearing, very industrial but we are making a wood house to fit over and decorate with older attachments so it fits in with our older house. I strongly recommend this product. At a previous location we had a locking box from supplier, it was nearly $300.00 and not nearly as user friendly. I will post review from our postal guy as well because we wanted feedback from him. Thank you Amazon for free shipping and great service. Nui"
1,The Mailguard Mailbox is Useless,"I installed my Mailguard in July of '03.On September 26, '03 someone used a very small slotted screwdriver to pry the door open & bend the lock arm.This lock arm is so soft as to be a useless deterent.The security of this mail box is all illusion and no substance until the manufacturer uses a better lock with a hardened or stiffer acuator arm."
3,no latch for top door,"The two door mail box I just received has no latch to hold the top door closed,it just falls open. can you send me some kind of latch that I can install to keep the door shut. other wise ok. Lloyd"
1,Poor choice for secure mail.,This item is too flimsy and easily popped open to offer any peace of mind.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MAIL BOX!,This mail box has been nothing but trouble. It is not weather proof. The latest problem is the door to the mail slot is falling off.Too bad I waited too long before trying to return it.
5,best documentary i have seen in a long time,"wow, Norma, you big con artist you, from the outset you will feel for this woman, untill you get 20 mins into the documentary & that's when you want to meet her & shake the truth out of her...did she really have a friend that was killed by her father?? NO SHE DID NOT...writting about an honor killing of her best friend in Jordan by her father.. the truth is about the only thing she doesn't give us....watch this doc it is very good"
5,I got this book by imagination!,"This book has been out of print. I have been looking for it for sometime over the net, and it is usually being sold for around one hundred bucks, sometimes more. So I imagined I was holding a copy of it, and feeling I paid very cheap price for it. Several months passed, I still couldn't see a seller selling for a reasonable price. Then one day out of the blue I decided to check again, and one seller just listed it for fifty dollars, a very good condition copy, and I immediately bought it! Now I'm holding it in my hands. Imagination works!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Three lengthy stories, two concerned with humans gaining new abilities above normal, and finally the artificial rights shorter tale, Jerry Was a Man. Why these particular stories were grouped, not quite sure other than perhaps the general evolution theme. Pure author popularity perhaps, as well?Assignment In Eternity : Gulf - Robert A.

3,I see it Like This 3 stars becuase i havent read it yet,"I see it like this. Any book about Leann Rimes is gonna a great book. Leann Can Sing,Dance,Act and Do anything She Puts her mind into. She Is My Favorite Country singer . God Bless Leann. LeAnn's Fan , LPs.s I will like the book as long as it says nice things about her."
3,Insightful,Very text-heavy (you can almost hear his soothing accent as you read); not many visuals to inspire you; helpful advice on topics ranging from engagement and reception to honeymoon destinations
5,Amazing,"I cannot express how much I enjoyed reading this book. It was instructional and had some very clever ideas I had not seen in the other fifty wedding books I've read in the last few months, however the photographs were even more impressive. I highly recommend this to any bride, although especially to those attempting to plan a semi-formal-formal elegant wedding."
2,"Some good advice, some over-the-top advice","I liked some of Cowie's advice, such as thinking of yourwedding as a way to set the style for your life together -- he got meto think about how we will entertain (instead of going out to an impersonal bar for a quick drink with friends on a weeknight, Cowie suggests:""Why not invite them into your home for a pitcher of icy Cosmopolitans and some wonderful olives, cheeses and crusty bread that you picked up on the way home from work?'' But when he tells me how movie stars and other rich and famous folks put on their weddings, I think, ""Yeah, right'' -- I don't have an unlimited budget! His last chapter also discusses ""Disagreements: how to survive and solve them"" -- I think I'll turn to books by psychologists, not an entertaining guru, for this kind of advice."
1,Fact Book?,"Bette Filley's ""Big Fact Book About Mount Rainier"" is interesting for a couple of reasons. First, she does present the reader with a large amount of history and information about Mt. Rainier, but some of the numbers regarding rockfalls, avalanches, glacial statistics, etc. change from chapter to chapter and this makes all of the statistics in the book suspect. This may seem like a small thing, but it does make the book useless as an accurate research tool.While the book does contain what may be the largest single collection of Mt. Rainier trivia out there and many interesting items of information it soon becomes very tedious trying to sort out what's correct or incorrect. Is it a good read? If you're looking for entertainment, portions of it are good. But if you're looking for hard facts, look elsewhere."
2,"Even if you're interested in Jim Tully, skip this one!","After reading Beggars of Life, I was hellbent on finding more of Jim Tully's work. Jarnegan, despite possibly being the first Hollywood novel in America and a hard-boiled chronicle of Irish ghetto life, is just not the worth the time required to track it down. The novel begins grittily enough, but soon meanders into endless diatribes by the protagonist, Jarnegan, that seem little more than excuse for the author to vent his own thoughts. Some very questionable, dimestore Nietzschean, vaguely anti-Semitic rants occupy these pages. Historically significant, but as far as Hollywood fiction is concerned, Day of the Locust (N. West) and Force Majeure (Bruce Wagner) are vastly superior."
5,Gasket was a perfect fit for 1997 Mustang Cobra,"the ports in this gasket are well oversized compared to the passages for the coolant and oil coming out of the engine block, as such alignment on installation is not a concern. Also the aluminum reinforcement blocks around the bolt holes help prevent over tightening and squishing the gasket."
5,Response to Above Reviewer Regarding .Net vs. VB,"Actually, since Documentum will interface w/ MS Office Suite, many solutions will be implemented in VBA.The above said, yes, some solutions will be implemented in VB and .Net."
1,New book - Obsolete technology,How useful is a book that uses obsolete technology? I am extremely dissapointed that a very recent book isn't focused on development in .NET. No one is going to implement a Documentum solution in Visual Basic. This book is useless.
4,What has not been said...,"... I do not know if I can add anything else to this great compilation of anti-hits with the obvious excpetion of Under the Bridge.Overall all of the musicianship is very solid, everybody loved Flea's wild bass playing and the guitar work is also very proficient.The two polarities in this album are the covers. Higher Ground is a spectacular cover that gives a different but not worse feel to a Stevie Wonder classic. Fire on the other hand adds a worse, unoriginal feel to the Jimi Hendrix classic.Some of the band's best and most fuinky material of their early years is also missing but for all those that own the albums this is no biggie. However the compilation faisl as a good introduction to either The Red Hot Chili Peppers or to their early years. I would not buy any of their compilations, but would instead focus on buying the individual albums."
5,A great complimation of Chili Peppers best earlier songs.,"What Hits is a great album that includes a great mix of the peppers best songs with hits such as Under The Bridge, Show Me Your Soul, Taste The Pain, Fire and more making it a must purchase for any Pepper fans out there!"
3,Eary Red Hot Chilli Peppers,"If you want a cd with really funky red hot chilli peppers then this cds for you, good band this cd is a little on the funky side though...."
4,Nuthin but the funk,"Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik are the only Peppers albums I ever got into, so there's some good memories on this disc for me. True Men Don't Kill Coyotes, Knock Me Down, The Brother's Cup, Taste the Pain, and Johnny Kick a Hole In the Sky are about it though, everything else here I could do without. So if you don't want to get all their early albums this works great."
1,Hahaha WHAT HITS???? ...that name sure was spot on for this CD.,"This CD totally sucks.Don't get me wrong,I love the RHCP,but the songs on this album just blow! The only song on here that I would call a hit,is ""Under The Bridge"".What the hell is a great song like that doing mixed up with all these bullcrap songs anyway??? ""Under The Bridge"" was released on the WB label,and this CD is from EMI. I could never figure that one out. My advice would be to skip this crappy CD and pick up their REAL greatest hits album that ALSO includes ""Under The Bridge"" along with other great songs around it,and don't waste your time or money on this awful album."
5,All Hits!,"Awesome! 18 tracks. HIGHER GROUND(stevie wonder) is awesomely done by anthony and the boyz. SHOW ME YOUR SOUL is weird,addictive, and extremely cool. One of the better songs is also TASTE THE PAIN. what can i say? Once again, the cd is filled with mad rythym, spiced rhymes, and lyrics so good only they can cram that much knowledge and thought and opinion in a single song. Like a fine wine, their songs get better with age, but once you like a song on this cd, you'll never get tired of it. Really. Buy it and find out what I mean."
2,what hits? is right...,"I didn't pay attention when I bought this cd. I just assumed it was greatest hits. It is not, and I don't know most of the songs nor do I like them. Why did they make this album? It kinda sucks!"
3,Not a fan of the early stuff from the RHCP's,"This CD is quite good in length and delivery. 18 tracks spanning the early years of RHCP's and a few new jingles. This CD is primarily aimed at fans of the early more funky style of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. There were a number of songs I did enjoy listening to and they were 'Higher Ground', 'Behind The Sun', Backwoods', 'Hollywood' and 'Under The Bridge'. These became later RHCP hits.The early grunge punk style of Red Hot Chili Peppers didn't suit my tastes and with age the band turned to more of a rock feel and this ended up being the ticket for the band. All in all this CD has it's qualities and its open for different people's tastes."
2,Only for Well informed Chili peppers fanatics,"You know a few days ago I had a chili peppers revelation. I didn't own any of their CDs, however I remembered how catchy the album ""Californiacation"" sounded when I went over to my friends houses and I remember also lovin' ""under the bridge."" I noticed that there was the highly priced greatest hits compilation, and then there as the below 10 dollars ""amazon 5 star"" rated ""What Hits?!"" I bought it with the intent of hearing a lot of songs like under the bridge. That song is on black sugar sex maghik, and not being an avid fan yet, I thought it would be less risky buying the best of collection. I love funk. The peppers are very original (when they aren't giving 5 covers) Most songs are from tyhe 80's and though remotely catchy, I wasn't able to latch on and enjoy it. Avid fans will probably love this - most songs charted. But fans familiar with californiacation and newer stuff will consider this fluff."
5,An Essential For Any Collector,"This is a CD of one of the greatest rock bands' stuff from the 80's. As you may know, this consists of songs from their first four albums, along with ""Under The Bridge"" from ""Blood Sugar Sex Magik"" and ""Show Me Your Soul"" from the Pretty Woman soundtrack. My favorite tracks are ""True Men Don't Kill Coyotes"", ""Jungle Man"", ""Fight Like A Brave"", ""Knock Me Down"" and definitely the famous ""Under The Bridge"". This band still has talent today, but their stuff from the 80's is more of a standout for me. If you only own the band's albums from ""Blood Sugar Sex Magik"" and so forth, you don't know what you're missing."
5,Excellent,Great CD. Classic Chili Peppers. Be sure this CD is only your list if you're starting or continuing your Red Hot Chili Peppers collection. Have fun and Enjoy life!
3,Elfstones of Shannara,"The low score is because of the condition of the book, which was stated in the description before I made my purchase. Other then that I love the store and looking forward to getting the next installment."
1,Lousy writing stolen wholesale from Tolkien,"Another Terry Brooks novel written by stealing the plot and characters from Tolkien. I honestly only made it halfway through this one at the insistance of my flat mate, who consistently lends me trashy fantasy novels of no value. It bothers me how much Brooks steals from Tolkien. Isn't there a law against this kind of brazen theft? And to do it so BADLY! Save your money and read something else."
3,Another War...,"I realllly liked The Sword Of Shannara but this falls short of what I was expecting. Only around half of the book talked about the main characters and what they were doing. It was very well written and kept me on the edge of the seat, but it took me nearly a month to finish it because I was wondering when it was gonna get back to the war or when it was gonna get back to Amberle and company. It also seemed that time was passing at different rates between the war and the quest. This book had a well-told story, but fell short of the standard set by the Sword."
4,"A good book, but not the best","I find it interesting that many found this to be better than the Sword of Shannara but...to each his own. I actually was a bit turned off by the romantic storyline that wound through this book; I found it distracting from what was actually going on. It was also a bit harder for me to become attached to the lead female character. But, it's certainly an entertaining and worthwhile read, and the series will be enjoyed over and over (I'm on my third read of the whole first and second sets).Once again Brooks proves his ability to make scenery jump off a page without the use of illustration. A vivid adventure!"
4,It is a good book with lots of action with in it++++++++,It's a very action filled book with elves and troll the Free corps and demons. With wil and amberle at his side they travel though the hollows and the witch sisters they outsmarted.
3,The Elfstones of Shanara: 2 (Sword of Shanara),Easy light reading. Enjoyable and fun. Also can be read separate from the other books in the series without missing anything.
5,Absolutly the best!!,"An absolutly wonderful book! Ecspecially after the ""Sword of Shannara""!! I couldn't put it down, if your looking for a fantastic read, read this book. I give Terry Brooks a standing ovation for the ""Elfstones of Shannara""!!"
5,Another winner from Brooks!,"I have just finished reading EOS,and like SOS,I just could not put the book down. Wonderfully realized characters,heart pounding encounters and escapes and a storyline that just flows. The book starts off with a bang and never really lets you down. Each chapter ends with you wanting more. I look forward to reading ALL the Shannara books. Can anyone recommend any other series out there besides Jordan's WOT? My e-mail address is ""geocourt@hotmail.com"". By all means get this book and start what appears to be a great series. You won't (hopefully) be dissapointed!"
3,"Nice, but never great","The Elfstones of Shannara gave me the same fealing as the previous one, the Sword of Shannara. It all goes to quick and to easy. The characters don't have the depth you seem to expect when you start reading books from a known writer as Brooks is.It is a good ""holiday"" book though, you can drop it anytime, do somtehing else, pick it up and go on. What I liked the best of this book are the huge battlescene's. Their the best I've ever read. The only downside to these scene's is the fact that the main character's are really invincible. They kill 20+ opponents every next scene. But ok, it is fantasy.One last thing. Allanon makes me very curious. I want to know more about this druid that lives through the ages."
3,Good Fantasy - for young readers,"This is a great book to introduce fantasy to young readers, however as a veteran fantasy reader it is a bit to light for my tastes. It is a very straight forward by the book fantasy novel, but it could not hold my interests. Terry Brooks may be a good author to introduce your kids to after Harry Potter, however you'd do them a greater service by sitting them down with ""The Hobbit"" instead."
5,perfection,"a book of perfection.after having read it 3 times, it still captures my imagination. this book could be the best book Brooks has ever written and deserves every compliment!"
5,the best,"This book is by far terry's best. The character development is just as good as tolkien if not better, and the battle in the end is the best out of them all(all shannara). Yes, the ending was great to."
2,OVER RATED!,"The entire Sword of Shannara series is one of my least favorites. Elfstones of Shannara is deffinately better than the first, but that isnt saying alot. The characters arent developed enough for me, Amberle and Wil were more likeable than most in this series, but the druid Allannon bores me to tears and is the most unlikeable good guy EVER! The plot is good, but the story advances way to fast. The whole world invented here doesnt work for me. How can you live in a land that you can apparently walk across in a matter of days, and have races of people unfamiliar with each other. I mean, if your going to dream up an entire world maybe it should be bigger than Maine. Apparently other people like it, but not worth the time in my eyes. Speaking of eyes, some one stick an icepick in mine so I can never read this book again!"
2,"There is nothign new under the sun,...","I have seen a lot of comparisons to Tolkien, as if Tolkien was interested in competing with other writers in his genre. Tolkien wrote and created a world. Others have come along and attempted to elaborate on that and make it their own - that's this book in a nutshell. If you enjoy Tolkien you may like this, but I think it's like a photocopy of a photocopy or a photocopy - kind of looks like the original, but blurred enough to be something else -- the original being the clearest. Brooks is a mediocre writer at best (as was shown in the writing for the Star Wars books). Come up with a new idea!"
3,"Great, but a clone of The Sword of Shannara!","I enjoyed most of this book, although I think that it has almost an identical plot outline as that of the Sword of Shannara: Allanon comes, and takes an Ohmsford, he hides his secrets from them, he tells them that only they can save the world, they moan and complain, they do it anyway, the quest, big battle scene, all ends well! But, don't mistake me! I enjoyed the book! If you like his other books you should read this one, for sure! My favorite part in the book is the battlescenes with the demons, and how Allanon uses his nagic to help them. What is great about this book is that it is realitstic, with alot of the 'good-guys' dieing also as well as the 'bad-guys'! I was a bit sad for Par Ohmsford, though, what happended to Amberle at the end! I think he really was in love with her.Well, that's just my opinion!"
1,My youth is dead...long live wisdom,"Wow...I remember LOVING these books when I was a kid, so I decided to reread them recently. What a bad choice to make! All I managed to do was ask myself ""what was I thinking?"" and waste precious hours of my life dragging myself through page after page of the same banal, repetetive storys and narration, all set in a world that I could not care less about and that had no depth. Ugh. This is wretch."
1,The Worst In The Series,"This is perhaps the dullest, least believable book Brooks has ever written. The plodding plot unwinds at a mind-alteringly slow pace, with no energy or joy."
3,"Its good, but not great","I read all the Shannara Series up until the scions of shannara, which I could not finish because it was the fourth Shannara that had the exact same plot. The elfstones is in my opinion the only Shannara book worth reading (Except the wishsong solely because of the addition of Garet Jax). The omshfords are called upon again to deal with something that only they can contest. Its basically a Tolkein Rehash."
4,"Good story, but old ideas","This was a 1980's book, so in those days this was good. Today, however, people are inventing new creatures aside from giant eagles, elves, demons and druids, so the Elfstones of Shannara is old material for me. I also notice that long books (500 pags. or so) tend to spend many words on miniscule details, so people would say it can be compressed to 400 or 300 pgs. and not lose its story.I gave this book 4 stars though because of the reading experience. The events are suspenseful, engrossing, and you can feel the characters, their emotions, hopes, dreams, fears and failures. Brooks writes well. I challenge him though and other writers to go out of the usual."
4,The first I've read,this is the first of the Shannara trilogy i've read.(i'm only 13) And now I'm here trying to find more to buy. I'm thinking of getting wishsong and I recommend this book to anyone with the likes of Fantasy.
5,no greater book written.,i could not put htis book down. i felt every emotionthere is possible to feel! WOW!! what great story!Way to go Terry Brooks!
5,Love it,great cleaning product for wood floors. Also great on cabinets and window seals puts a nice coating on the wood
2,Not worth the cheap price,"We purchased this spotting scope a few years ago. The viewing field is surprisingly dim and lacks the vibrance you'd like to see from a product like this. In particular, you see its shortcomings when you compare it to a more expensive pair of binoculars or even a decent handheld scope.We also have an issue with the eyepiece falling out because of the wimpy threads that hold on the locking ring. Getting service has also been difficult, as the local dealer told us we'd have to contact the manufacturer directly, after the manufacturer referred us to the dealer.If this is all you can afford, I'd save your money for another year and buy something better."
3,How to Raise and Train a Rhodesian Ridgeback,"This is an old book but the method of training this particular breed is superb. The author truly understands the Ridgeback and how to get the most from your dog. When I first started raising my Ridgeback puppies, I tried other non-specific breed training books with no success. With the help of this book, I was able to train a loyal, dependable, diciplined dog who became an invaluable family member."
1,"Was not even close to color we expected. It looked BROWN not red, at all.","A real bust. Not what was described at all. I completely wasted my money on this purchase. It was too cheap to justify the postage necessary to return it. Live and learn. I won't buy a belt like this online again. I needed the color we saw in the description, like the photo above, but received brown."
2,"Seller great, but the color is all wrong","No problems with the seller. The package arrived quickly and the price could not be beat.Unfortunately, the Cardinal Red belts I ordered, which should have been a bright vivid red, and which appear on the website as such, are hardly that color at all. The belts are dark, cranberry sauce red, which, unfortunately, doesn't come any where near matching our true Cardinal Red uniforms. Oh well. They will be relegated to practice belts and I will keep searching."
4,Decent for the money.,"My son is wearing this for little league. He is a stocky 12 year old. Fits him good, have had no issues with quality. Recommend."
2,Don't expect it to be yellow,"If you were expecting Gold to be yellow, as in uniform yellow, the base color axiomatic regular old sunflower safety tape yellow- look elsewhere. The belt is orange. I don't know how they sell an orange color that could look more orange than this.Also, if you have dark pants, this belt's inside lining shreds like toilet paper and it will get all over your pants each time you put it on.The buckle is exactly what you'd expect for this price.But, tt holds up my pants and the elastic works just fine. It was cheap and functional. Two stars for that."
3,"Good Belt, Wrong color.","I ordered maroon and was surprised at how brown it actually was. I held it up to a pair of brown pants and it basically matched. It was not a wrong product because they do not offer brown. Other than my complaint about the color, it feels like a pretty nice belt. Seems strong so far and quite durable. Good belt good price, expect a darker color."
5,Amazing book any age,A book you won't mine reading every night. Great story with great drawings...My 4 year old loves it so do I.
5,Stone Soup,This is a story that should be shared with children and adults all over the world. In these troubled times this is a story that teaches everyone the beauty of the human spirit with the lesson that if you just open your heart a little to others amazing things can occur! Jon J.Muth is an excellent writer.
2,Consider other versions of this tale,My daughter thought the monks looked scary and kept asking me to close the book. She didn't feel any connection with the little girl who is supposed to be the main character. If you want to teach your child about giving and sharing I would explore other versions that children may relate to more easily.
5,well done,This is a refreshing version of the classic story set in a different country and featuring three buddhist monks - beautifully written and beautiful illustrations.
4,Good starter book or manual for one time users,"I bought this book and the microsoft ""step by step"" manual. I thought the Microsoft book was a little more in depth. I think this is a good book for people that are going to do one web page and want to ""follow a map"" that will result in their creating a decent if not spectacular web page. I would rate this book as worth the money. You can with nothing but this book make a web page. If you are considering learning web design as a trade then thid book will be to ""lite"""
1,A Disappointment.,"I have read a number of books on FrontPage 2000. This book has to be rated as ""Poor"" if not ""the Poorest."" It is hasty, sketchy, confusing at places, poorly structured and leaves out quite a few important features of FrontPage even for beginners. The examples are narrow. The numerous ""coffee breaks"" are laughable. The CD-ROM included in the book is crude and really of little use. I would not recommend it even for a beginner."
5,Danger makes you Shiver,"I started reading Danger.com last nite at 10:30 P.M. and forced my self to stop reading at 12:00 A.M! I finished this morning! It was sooo good you would not believe it. The way Jordan Cray uses charictorazation and forshadowing is unbelievable! This is the 3rd Danger.com book that i have read, and I think it is the best! I am waiting for the Book Fair to come to the school so i can buy more of these WONDERFUL books. I give this book 5 stars 'cuz it is one of the best i have read! it is thrilling, suspenceful and it makes you think that you are not safe from anyone..."
4,NASCAR Tech Amazingly Poor!,This book was an enjoyable read but what I found to be amazingly obvious from all of the stories that it contains was that NASCAR's tech department was awful for a very long time. How come it took them so long to figure out that they needed to weigh the cars AFTER the race? Could they really have been that stupid? It didn't take any serious effort to get anything past them for ages. How could they not find an oversized engine or fuel cell after the race?Overall it's an entertaining read and worth reading because some of the stories are quite entertaining.
2,Cheating: An Inside Look at the Bad Things Good NASCAR Winst,The book over stated and recounted the same infractions over and over. Always comparing one modification to the one in the previous chapters.It would have been nice if NASCAR would have let the author maybe list a chapter from modification that teams have tried to get pst NASCAR and didnt. Plus the fines.
5,Sesame Street VHS,"Big Bird's Favorite Party Games is a delight!It brought back wonderful childhood memories!This vhs, not available in dvd. It came inperfect, working order, brand new conditon!Very enjoyable~"
2,Not worth the time,"I saw this film on HBO. It was a waste of my time. The ending was weird and I didn't quite get why the girl was so nuts. I wish it would have focused more on what the Jewish people went through in WWII. Trust me, skip this movie!"
2,"Confusing, slow script","I watched this movie very late at night. but I do not think that it affected how confused and bored I was with this movie. It was poorly concieved, not to mention the fact that Claire Danes' perfrmance was weak."
4,Julia Stiles was great. A stunning performance.,I could watch this movie over and over again. julia Stiles brought tears to my eyes with her emotional performance.
2,"not horrible, but not great","(The rating should actually be 2.5 stars.) After reading some of the glowing customer reviews of this movie, I wonder if I don't remember it as clearly as I thought. I watched this with my mom, and both of us thought the script and direction weren't up to par. Both seemed forced--the dialogue didn't flow very well, and didn't sound easy and natural. The music also really bothered me--a lot of the time it was overly emotional and melodramatic, and reminded me of soap opera music. However, there are redeeming aspects--the three leads. Jeanne Moreau, Claire Danes, and Jude Law are all very talented, and all manage to do respectable jobs. Danes has good chemistry with both Moreau and Law, and that shines through the often bumbling lines. So I didn't hate it, and it wasn't unbearable--obviously some people loved it. If you really like any of the main actors, and the story sounds interesting, go ahead and give it a whirl. Just don't expect too much."
3,JUDE LAW..YUMMI...WEIRD STORY,"This was the 1st movie i saw with Jude Law and i fell in love with him right away. I think this story is very sweet at the begining but it is a little bit weird and confusing.. u gotta keep up with Claire Danes's character which is a weirdo girl. I bought this dvd a while ago but what i didnt like is that there is a part that they edited, where they are in the park and they start kissing and he is about to take off her top and she says ""no, just wait..wait for me"" something like that. THEY TOOK THAT OFF! man!"
2,Not what I expected................,Claire Danes played a good role in this movie but the dreams about her crush object (Jude Law) were rather confusing. The movie goes back and forth to the past to the present and it's hard to keep up with. The story was rather choppy as a result and I didn't feel as though the movie ended as it should have. End note......Don't get your hopes up.
3,Not bad.....,"I admit....the only reason I rented this movie at first was to see Jude Law. I must say it was a movie worth watching if you are interested in romance or drama movies or if you are interested in one of the leading cast members (i.e. Jude Law, James Van Der Beek, or Clare Danes). I must admit this movie's plot was a weak one. The Holocaust was really out of place in this plot. I found that it would have been better as a ""coming of age"" story for the main character Daisy. I can relate to her struggles and her triumphs (I've been through and still going through the whole nine yards....except I never dated the man of my dreams). I think this movie could have been better written, but nevertheless it is a decent movie."
5,Breath taking performance and movie,"This is my favorite movie, this is the first movie i ever saw with jude law but since i have seen others and this is one of his best performances. And i think this is Claire Danes best performance very emotional and touching. I recommend this movie especially to teens but also to any age group."
5,Amazing book,"This book is no longer in print because Sela is coming out with a new, updated one, but we recently met her at a meetup and had to get it. Everything she says makes complete sense and I am excited to be taking her class and getting started with these healing rocks."
3,Previous reviews fooled me,"I bought this book after reading the other reviews here on Amazon. Unfortunately, I did not find the book as informative as the reviews promised. I thoroughly appreciated the author's views of and hope for the future, and I agree that the knowledge of the healing energies of crystals is being awakened in many. However, I do not believe this book will be the cure-all, end-all that the other reviews would lead one to believe. If it is available in your local library, I would suggest checking it out first to see if it is for you. I did find Randazzo's story and information entertaining, and I give the book a 3-star rating."
2,"odd, left something to be desired","I have been using crystals now for a few years, and try to read all the books I can for reference and new material. I will say this is new. Totally different than anything I have read. It was not particularly helpful for me in any way. There are no diagrams or illistrations at all, I find these helpful when trying new things. Also the authors personal story while interesting seemed out of place in this book. Many of her ideas are contrary to much that I have read and what I find works for me. That is not to say it is not true, just not for me. I would check the library before buying, its not eveyones cup of tea."
1,Not for Me.,Maybe some people get something out of this book but I found it pretty useless. I got nothing out of it.
5,A childrens Christmas classic,"I had this album as a child on vinyl and loved it, found it when I became a mother myself on cassette tape and played it for my four children who still love it. I was elated to now find it offered digitally so I can keep sharing it with my new stepchildren and grandchildren. It is a Christmas delight for all ages. My children who are now in their twenties still love the songs on this album and Nat King Cole's voice is and always will be timeless. For the young and young at heart who like Christmas, I highly recommend this one."
5,Wonderful!,"I absolutely love this cd!!. Evoking cherished memories of holiday seasons gone by - the brightness of a sun drenched field blanketed in snow, the warmth of a blazing fire in the hearth, the laughter and good wishes, the sparkling, wonder-filled eyes of children awaiting Santa- Nat King Cole's renditions of the many classics on this album thoroughly embody the spirit of Christmas. In addition, the fact that a portion of the proceeds benefits the Children's Defense Fund, a wonderful non-profit organization dedicated to advocating the rights of children across the country, makes it even better. An instant classic!"
5,Xmas 4 kids from 1 to 92,"Mr. Cole's music is profound, especially during the holiday season. While growing up, we listened to a Christmas album that was very similar to this new release-- and the music warmed our hearts, having the same affect on us as viewing the glowing Christmas tree through the frosted, glass window of our home or smelling Grandma's cinnamon apple pies bake in the oven. When listening to his holiday music, the sights and smells of my childhood Christmas rush back to me with great joy. You will admire and love the music of this classic collection. The sounds will never go out of style!"
3,Backwards?,"I go into Call of Duty, and the directions are reversed. I had to put the white in the red and red in the white to fix the problem. Works great other than that."
