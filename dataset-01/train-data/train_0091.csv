1,Are you running out of fake names Timbo?,"Fred B. Who is that Tim? Gee he sure is upset for a neutral third party. Timbo you may suck at being a ""filmmaker"" but your wacked out ranting and delusions make you a laugh riot....By the way I would put War of the Worlds in the pile of dung category except dung has some useful purposes. You need a bettertherapist."
1,Poor Quality Film School Project,"That's what this movie looks like. A poor quality film school project that got a failing grade. The acting is poor and the cinematography is even worse. They seemed to blue screen everything, and poorly at that. Would it have been too hard to find a location to shoot like film school graduates?Don't waste your money on this version. Go buy another like the 1950's version. You'll be much happier. Trust me. However if you need a drink coaster this would do nicely."
1,War of the Fields,"After suffering through this garbage for three hours I thought they should have called The War of the Fields. Why? Because the martians land in a field, the writer's house is in a field, the writer tells his wife and maid to wait in a field while he walks through a field to get a horse and buggy that has no horse,he takes them to her cousin's house which I think was in a field,he goes to return the horse? and buggy and then wanders through a field for a half an hour, the curate finds him in a field, the writer's brother leaves London and encounters a field. I've read the book several times and I don't remember there being so many fields. Maybe Timothy Hines owns a lot of land. These are just a few things that are bad about this movie. It does follow the book but just because the writer does walk a lot doesn't mean we have to see it for half of the movie."
1,Unbelievably bad,"I thought this movie was a put-on for the first few minutes, then I realized it was actually as bad as it seemed. I paid very little for it and it still cost too much. The acting is what you might expect from a fourth-grade class doing their first run-through of the school play. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen."
4,GOOD JOB! Respectable Fair- family fun.,"This is a very faithful adaptation of the book War of the Worlds. It includes some intense gross violence, but it's more psychologically scary, but there's no sex and no bad language. This is suitable for teens and mature 12 year-olds. Younger than that, parents use descretion. We love it and appreciate a faithful telling of this tale.We give it two thumbs up and two kid thumbs up."
1,Just plain terrible,This was the worst video that I have seen. It looked like it was made on someones home computer with the most rudimentary software. It is very jerky. The scenes all look like they were made on a computer. The acting was terrible. All of the acting was over the top. Fake mustaches look very fake. Its only redeeming value is that it followed the book exactly. Might as well listen to the book on tape. I can't believe that this thing was even sent to the market.
3,I enjoyed this movie,"I will not compare this to other versions, as that would be unfair. I think the story was predictable in places, but some of the supporting cast was superb. Everyone did a good job, and the Narrator LOOKED GREAT! :)Anyway, the movie was entertaining and I enjoyed it. The movie sountrack is really good. If you like sweeping strings and classic drums, you should definitely purchase the soundtrack."
2,Storyboard using human actors.,"I did see the big WOW this summer. I knew that this one was trying to get out. If you must have a version more like the book, then I guess that this is it. There is too much walking around, as other have said it seems that nearly every foot of digital film shot was used to get it up to the three hour running time. I would have preferred a more ""Classics Illustrated"" like version of this movie. I did not pay much for it, but I also probably won't watch it again. Just too long for the payoff. It seems more like a storyboard using human actors, instead of drawings. I did want it to get out, however."
1,100 reviews - how many are by the director?,"No-one else could be so stupid to think this garbage is anything like a real movie, let alone a classic. It is funny that all the good reviews all say the same thing. You would think he would at least change the script instead of congratulating himself all the time! But true, no-one else will after seeing this rubbish.No stars for this fakery!"
1,VERY dissapointing,"My mom bought this movie for me for my birthday as well as the newest version with Tom Cruise. This version is so poorly done, we fast forwarded through the whole thing. It's so bad it's funny. To think someone could make this movie and expect people to actually enjoy it. Throughout the whole movie, it's like they're pussyfooting around to get to the good stuff (which there was none). There were quite a few CG effects that looked like they were done by a child. Very dissapointed in it. Do yourself a favor and save your money and use it towards the version with Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning. Seeing Dakota's performance in it was worth the money alone. I saw it twice in theatre and enjoyed every bit of it. It had me talking for months"
3,They do follow the book...,"While 180 minutes long, I can't complain about that. Many of the movies coming out now a days, in trying to be loyal to their source, are getting longer. Also, as for the color, I think a lot of that has to do with the slow appearance of the red weed and also the fact that clouds and smoke reflect red from fires and fighting, as Wells wrote about in his book.Even the tripods and Martians were not that bad looking. But I happen to be a fan of the Thunderchild and its battle against the three war machines in the novel. So I have to take two points away for that - that was plain bad. No way to defend those scenes - Jeff Wayne's video game had better battleships.Only a sci-fi fan, a fan of Wells or a fan of MST3K should watch it. With maybe a few glasses of hard cider to soften the blows."
3,Little Indie Movie of Large Story Makes a Good Evening.,"This is not the big budget Spielberg Cruise version of War of the Worlds. This is an indepedently made film that totally follows the original novel by H. G. Wells. Dialogue is right out of the book. It's settings and scenes are all out of the book, very uniquely presented in an old-fashioned style. There was obviously great care in presenting this material entertainingly and accurately. My family and I had a great time watching it. Made a great weekend night for all and I'd recommend it to your family."
1,Worst film I've EVER seen!,"I like movies. I enjoy movies. This is the ONLY movie I haven't watched all the way through. Less than 10 minutes in to this movie and I was BORED.The effects are shoddy and laughably bad (I could do better in less than 10 minutes).The acting is tedious.The script is weak.The attempt at English accents... well, don't even get me started.Basically this movie was a complete waste of time and money, both to make and to watch.There's no excuse for a movie this bad.Pendragon should stop right now."
2,Faithful but awful acting,"Like other reviewers I have always enjoyed HG Wells' War of the Worlds and was looking forward to seeing an adaptation set in the early 1900s when Wells' story is set. However, the acting in this film is dreadful. The characters are 1 dimensional and simply don't interact. In fact wooden is the only term that comes to mind. I could forgive the awful CGI effects but when combined with a poorly directed, edited and acted film the end result is barely watchable.The reason I have given it two stars is because it is faithful to the book and therefore Wells' story telling manages to come through-just.A hefty re-edit and deletion of some of the worse CGI effects might improve the film, for example, let us imagine the Martians feeding.If you love the book the film might be worth watching but I wouldn't rush to buy it."
4,GREEEEEEAT.,"This is one of the funniest and intriguing films I have seen in years, and it is full of classical scenes from the book for those of us who studied them. The acting is also excellent. Warmly recommended."
1,YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING!,"This is the stinker di tutti stinkeri! The CGI is DOA on this one. How could they have the nerve to release it? OK the acting is better than the Tom Cruise version, but that's like saying gonnorhea is better than herpes. Three hours of amateur film, and is there actually an editor here? The video game quality FX is not laughable, its tear jerkable. If you want to challenge yourself, if you want to see how much stinko film you can tolerate, by all means buy this GARBAGE! Otherwise, get the Gene Barry version, watch the George Pal effects, and consider yourself lucky."
2,None,Not a bad adaptation to the book but let down by its seriously bad acting and extreamly low budget effects.
1,Seeing Is Believing,"This ""movie' is terrible.Before you spend any money on this abomination go to the official Pendragonpictures website and take a look for yourself at some stills from the movie. If you're still not convinced follow the link to the ""StuffoHowStuffWorks"" site to see the offical trailer. Yes - Pendragon's site is so cheap they can't even afford to host a preview for their own movie! Use the link entitled ""CLICK HERE for all trailers"" as the link they've set up to take you to the ""Full Theatrical Trailer"" doesn't even work (both Pendragon and Stuffo messed this one up). Watch the ""final"" theatrical trailer, theatrical trailer, ""Message from the Cast"" and teaser trailer. If watching these don't convince you how awful this thing really is then you must be as out-of-touch with reality as the people who made it.Thanks for letting the fans down, Timbo.It's an authentic period piece of garbage."
4,A dramatic story of love & courage.,"I saw this movie and enjoyed it. It's a dramatic story of love, courage, and how one man faces unsurmountable odds and pulls through.The story follows the 1898 book it is based on almost scene for scene. It begins with the first line of the book and ends with almost the last line. A few things have been changed around but it makes sense.The story is very well told. When a meteor lands near an English country town, the locals have excitment at what might be inside. They get more than they bargain for. The end of the world at the hands of Martian invaders.The main character, the Writer/Narrator transforms from a casual, almost aloof man of leisure to a hardened, kean survivor using all his strength to keep his heart intact. There's crucial comedy relief by John Kaufmann as the Curate. It is an epic scale movie that takes 3 hours to tell. A brave effort."
1,'50s movie is better than tis.,"To Michael Franco who wrote ""IF IT WAS MADE IN THE FIFTIES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MASTERPIECE"", that is definetely not true. In fact I suggest you watch the 1952 movie, which has much more believable special effects than this movie has. The '50s movie is still watchable today and stands miles from this garbage."
3,I'd watch it again.,The special effects are fair. The acting is very good. The Martians are creepy. Some scenes are very cool but nothing blew me away. The plot is good and the emotions of the story are strong. It was very interesting I guess.
4,I will admit to anyone who asks that this is my favorite WOTW movie.,"I love this film. Some of my friends(quite a few in fact) believe this movie to be one of the corniest and sappiest movies ever made, I say to you all, stop, chill out and see this movie for what it is, Scifi cult cinema at it's rip-roaring roller coaster best. This is probably not the movie for you if you must have the latest SPFX technology. For those that want to immerse themselves in an action /adventure movie second to none, totally loyal to original Wells classic book, crank up your home theatre system and let the Narrator, Wife, Curate, Artilleryman, Brother, Elphinstones and the well-known astronomer Ogilvy that is Jack Clay take you on an action packed journey to survive the Martians."
4,A wonderful film.,"A wonderful film.This movie is like a painting hanging in a museum, only it ignites with action and drama. It is deserved of admiration and sufficiently will fill the appetite of all movie goers.I enjoyed it very much and hope you do too."
3,This is a caring book-to-screen transition.,I got my copy of this movie today and it is my day off so I watched it this afternnon.This movie is engagingly acted in a surreal template of an aged photograph. This rendition of The War of the Worlds is one of the most caring book-to-screen transitions ever made. I felt every emotional turn for the characters in peril.There is no other movie quite like this one. It is a lush film despite its lack of budget. And it is well told.
4,I'm glad.,"I am glad to tell you that if this is the best WOTW movie made. It is no blockbuster. Oooooh, if only the heavyweights in show business could give Pendragon the money chest to remake this version with a big big budget. Be it as it is, that will probably never happen in my lifetime. So..."
4,Simple and good.,"While it is a simple story made on small dollars and TV special effects, the movie does an exceptional job developing the plot.The two story lines integrate without ruining the movie for someone who has not seen it or read the book. While the main plot follows the Writer, the second plot follows his Brother in London. I thought the Brother plot was well done. While the Writer plot was long sometimes,the acting and directing in the movie was great at moments, but mostly very good. I did think the editing could have been better, but mostly everyone was incredible in this movie.Personally, due to the Writer searching to find his love mixed with the bizarre Martian visuals, I do think this is a movie I would watch cuddled on the couch with a new date. However, I nonetheless think the plot is excellent and I do highly recommend seeing this movie. I give the movie 4 stars for how the movie integrates the two story lines together and the acting in the movie."
3,Definitely.,"Definitely number one in movies based on Wells' The War of the Worlds. Still not the greatest movie on the planet, but good for a night's amusement and definitely a great deal."
4,Magical ride.,"A magical ride that lets you be a kid again watching dignified society wiped out by lurking drooling Martians, without giving up all the cynicism inherent with being an adult. Fun, fun, fun."
5,Victorious.,"At first, the Martians have more desperation and will than human beings. The narrator who is reporting the suffering tragedy he lived through also is a human being really involved in the invasion and affected by the war. The fear of the unknown Martians and the tension of being totally cut off (like our dear neighbors in New Orleans God bless them), the fear of the unknown, makes this film timeless."
4,Enjoyable movie,We had a good time watching the movie. We especially liked the tripod machines blowing up the towns.
4,This movie is the book,As a life long H. G. Wells fan I am surprised at how accurately they transcribed Well'es book into a movie. This is probably the closest translation the movies of any book ever. And it was done with much reverence for the material. I happily suggest this movie as one to see.
4,A good attempt,"I got this title since I am a fan of the War of the Worlds genre. I have the George Pal version and even after all these years it is still an ejoyable if too short film. I have also seen the Spielberg / Cruise movie and I did not like this. Too many absurdities and not Wells as far as I'm concerned.This title is very long at 3 hours and really does drag on in some sections. However the quality of the Old style worlde it provides is excellent and it is the closest screenplay I've seen to a book.The only reason I have to be negative about this film is that the special effects ruin it. They went for the ""Sky Captain : World of Tomorrow look"" and failed . If this film could be redone with the even the George Pal SFX then it would be a classic.I would only advise you to get this if you can look past the SFX and see the gem in the dirt."
4,This movie is realistic then bizarre and horrifying.,This movie is realistic then bizarre and horrifying.I'm here to say I liked this movie. It's fun and exciting and super cool. It's the only movie version of War of the Worlds to respect H. G. Wells' writings and I admire that. I had a great time watching this movie and expect you will do the same.
1,Buy this film: Tim Hines has a very large family to feed,"Director/writer/bad videographer Timothy Hines obviously has a large family - a lot of sisters and aunts is my guess. They're the ones swamping this board with five-star reviews comparing this worthless trash to some great work of art that should be hanging in a museum. Three hours of inept home movie boredom, don't let anyone con you into thinking this is 'experimental' or a tribute to silent movies or a great epic. It's like something the Simpsons might make if they borrowed Ned Flanders video camera and kept on filming after the batteries went low. A total waste of money, it's not even a real film."
1,Cheap dumb ripoff,"Even if there wasn't a big budget Spielberg Cruise film coming out, this would still be a total ripoff. It's so bad even Channel 5 wouldn't show it at four in the morning. One reviewer said it looked like it had been shot by a chimp, but he's being too generous. A chimp throwing faeces at the camera would be a better filmmaker than these am-dram-hams. It would do a better job of keeping the camera still as well. Everything about this home video is substandard bad. Don't believe the good reviews this is getting here: this belongs in the trash. I am the original six foot Pole, and even I would not touch this!!!"
1,Like watching paint dry,"This movie is the worst and most boring piece of crap I have ever watched. Ok I did not watch it all because it is so bad.Did Timbo take too much Exlax and this film is the result?I understand Timbo now claims he is going to re-release a shorter version. I suspect Timbo will have to sell his new ""improved"" version out of the trunk of his car. (That is if he can even afford a car). Once the interest in War of the Worlds generated by the release of the Spielberg version dies down, no distributor will touch any ""improved"" Hines' piece of crap with a 10 foot pole...."
5,Hilarious,"This is truely brilliant, I laughed all the way through, and thats alot of laughing as it's a mammoth 3 hours long. The acting is rotten, the effects... well what can i say, the director has perfect comic timing, unfortunately i don't believe any of this is intended to be amusing. But If, like me, you enjoy the crude effects of doctor who and more recently the genious, ""Garth Marengi's Dark Place"" spoof tv show, then i recommend you have a butchers at this little beauty.Favourite moments: The first vapourizing scene with the crazy skelletons, look out for the chinaman too. And the tripod crushing a human, oh, and the battle ship scene. There's just to many actually, just watch it."
1,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!,"This movie was truly a piece of crap. My wife picked it up at Sam's Club for about eight bucks, so not much money lost. The acting is crap, the special effects are crap, it's overly long.....It's just crap. I couldn't finish it the first day, seen the other half the second day. However, we'll probably keep the movie since the kids (3, 8 and 10 Y.O.) laughed like crazy!"
3,WE REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE,I didn't know anything about this movie when I bought it. Some girls and I watched it together and we all really liked it. it was a bit long but the soldier was very cute. It was kind of shocking and gory but kind of not always because sometimes the effects didn't look totally real. But we recommend it.
2,"Please stop-motion FX Harryhausen, come back!!","Since the story is the greatest ever writtenI couldn't possibly think that I would consider this was going to be a crapy film but after seeing the special effects I must ask myself, if this is some kind of joke or an unfinished demo version I came across?The worst ever imaginable ""CGI"" you've ever come across on this side of 1985 (just watch the hilarious Thunderchild vs. tripod scene.)And when the first alien emerges from the cylinder all my hopes that this was going to be a great film was pulverized.Hello? Ancient Videogame anyone?!Although quite entertaining to watch with a lot of good laughs!And the acting wasn't much to talk about either.Sorry Timothy, better luck next time."
1,ummm ... okay.,"Holy. Mother. Of crap.If I had a choice of watching this movie again or being be-headed, I'd take the latter in a heart beat.Don't bother. Buy 2 Big Mac Combo's instead."
1,REREAD the novel instead... seriously.,"Yes, I truly wanted THIS version to be worthy of praise (Wells and his book surely deserve a great rendering) but, it is not. Do not waste your time trying to pick out a few positives amidst this hopeless mess of amateurish film making. Earnest efforts and good intentions cannot replace the skills that are required to cause one to suspend disbelief and become immersed in a story."
1,The War of the Worlds,Very bad movie.....the actors...the script ....very poor...I am disappointed. If I can I will return de movie.Tessie Martinez
1,Perhaps a good bad movie!,"""For the first time ever, the true adaptation of the classic novel..."" says the back cover from the DVD.Yes, BUT:Unfortunately, the movie is BAD in every aspect of the word! Bad directing, bad acting, awful editing, an almost constant annoying synthethised music, half rendered (or unfinished?) special effects, etc, etc, etc...Fortunately, because it is so bad, it could become, with time perhaps, one of these cult movies such as Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", and which you could watch again with some B movies geeks just to have a good fun about it."
1,Crikey Tim - what's that smell!?!?!,"Ok, let me first start by saying that i love HG Wells stuff. And i'm still glad i purcahsed this for that reason, but for gods sake - a little editing and about an hour cut out of this movie would have made all the difference!!I didn't mind that terrible acting, bad CGI and poor dialogue....i even found the likeness to gay porn amusing rather than annoying, but alas i still fell asleep!!!All credit to Mr Hines for trying to do it true to era, but it promised so much and delivered so little. pity."
1,"Bland, boring unimaginative cookie cutter exploitation stuff","Bland, boring unimaginative cookie cutter exploitation stuffThomas Haines, MinneapolisI notice several near identical rave reviews claim there is `nothing cookie cutter' about this picture. Even being generous and presuming they're not all shills for this sorry mess, the whole film is the epitome of bad cookie cutter filmmaking. Everything is formula, everything is predictable and the only surprise is how bad, how overlong and how UNfaithful to the soul of Wells book it really is. Dispiriting stuff from rank amateurs."
1,THIS IS AN INSULT!...,"This film is an insult! I haven't seen it in a cinema. The first and only close encounter was the DVD edition.It is a serious candidate to surpass the considered worst film... God Bless ""Plan 9"" . At least it is funny...I'm waiting for the winter to burn it in my chimney.Joao Pereira Bastos Lisbon Portugal"
2,Can you say LAME!,"I could have made a movie much better than this with a camcorder, some friends, a backyard, and the money in my wallet. This was a piece of Horse Crap! Come on! Surely the flames and the battleships (which I swear, Did not travel 100mph across the English Channal in real life!)could be a little more realistic. I felt as if this movie could be seriously improved with a budget that exceeds $10!"
2,Not what I expected,This is not the movie that I thought it was. The one that I was looking for was the one with Gene Barry in it. You can tell that this movie is not up to par.
3,If you like Sci Fi you'll like this.,"It's not a bad film, it's just different. I think it was a good way to tell War Of The Worlds.The thrust of the movie is about martians invading the planet and turning us into the ants beneath their feet. As the Martians deploy their machines mess with the sky and make the sky shift into different lights at different times, casting the world into different colors as time progresses, with a weird all-encompassing red stage that's most memorable. Even if you're not into the action and the martians and the rest of the movie, fans who appreciate unique visuals in cinema have got to see this one."
4,Mostly enjoyable.,"Like many of the other reviewers there were special effects that were not as good as the Spielberg version. However, the film was still the best sci-fi telling of War of the Worlds. If you've seen the previous versions then you should definitely check this one out. I agree that there were not enough battles. However, the dialogue and character interaction was dramatic. As an ordinary film fan this War of the Worlds is mostly enjoyable."
4,Now I know - great movie.,"Now I know why this movie is getting so much attention.I loved this movie, and I do understand why it has garnered so much attention and love from the public. It is very well made, and it kept me 'glued to the screen' from beginning to end. Anthony Piano plays the Narrator very well, and this film takes us through every major event in H. G.' book.Now I plan to re-read the book that this film is based on.This is an innovative, great movie."
4,An achievement in independent cinema.,"Wells' definitive Martian invasion story is portrayed in this independent film with attention to story detail and character development. I have found the Hollywoodized versions of H. G. Wells' masterpiece War of the Worlds quite extravagant and ugly in their execution. This film version, (albeit small in budget compared to the hundreds of millions purportedly spent on the summer blockbuster version), is both insightful and respectful to the author's original intentions and story lines. I absolutely loved it and believe you will find it enjoyable as well."
3,Interesting movie.,I liked this movie. It kept my interest. I dind't even know it was three hours until it was over.
3,Good bargain for a good night's fun.,"Not super great but really good. Fun fighting, destruction and tears. Great bargain. Good night's fun."
1,Not even exorcism could save this film!,"In the old days the only way you could buy films was on Super 8mm. They would be cut down to 10 or 20 minutes, and sometimes mediocre films would be much better with all the padding cut out. Bad films would become fun sometimes. But even on Super 8mm, you couldn't improve this. Why? Because it's all padding. Anything to avoid telling the story in the book. Honestly, there is NOTHING there for 97% of the time, and when it does try to throw in a big scene like the battleship fighting a war machine, it just looks like something a four year old might come up with on his Fisher Price My First Computer. There isn't even 5 minutes of good stuff here. This is so bad nothing can save it."
4,Loved it - true to Wells,"I loved this movie for being the first picture to really be true to Wells, his story and visions. The pit at Horsell Common, the cylinder, the martians, the fighting machines, the collapsed house and the handling machines all fit what Wells described. Touche."
3,Good flick. A good nights entertainment.,"I liked this movie. They did a good job telling the story and making the martians interesting and strange. Like giant brains with gross wormy arms.I'm not much for the whole London thing, but my wife loved that so, good job on pleasing the wife.My favorite guy was the astronomer, he was class. They should have kept him alive longer.I think you'll enjoy this movie. It's no Armegeddon, but I had a lot of fun."
1,"Cynical, heartless slapdash quickie gets everything wrong","This film is bad on every way possible to be bad. It looks like it was shot in five days by people who'd never seen a film before and never read the book. It's obviously just a cheap riopoff designed to steal people's money. Fine. Nothing wrong with that. Plenty of ripoffs can be fun. Trancers was more fun than Blade Runner for me, but I'm not pretending it was better like some people are with this. This is just boring, goes on forever and doesn't care - as long as they've got three hours of something they can call War of the Worlds they can get on to DVD at the same time as the big movie, they don't care.Here's what they give you for your money: No love, no care, no fun. If you want to encourage the kind of people who make this kind of crap, fine, buy it. But they'll be laughing at your gullibility, promise you that."

1,Ick!,"How this film got released is a mystery. I mean, film 101 is about color correction and scene melding, and they failed miserably at both. The acting is wooden and the effects tragic. People burst into flame and burn- but their clothes and hair are unscortched. The other CGI looks like a 1990 PC game... except worse. Look up the director's name, and you'll find ONE other cinematic credit, and it's from Troma (the folks that brought you the Toxic Agenger series). So, no wonder.Stay Away!"
2,Genuine Effort,"This version has one redeeming feature i.e. it is reasonably faithfull to the original story, but that is about it. The attempt to translate early silent techniques to modern day do not work. I have not seen the 2005 edition yet, but it will have to be very good to approach the quality of the Gene Barry version. He is a great actor, look at the movie ""The 27th Day""."
3,H. G. WELLS' TEH WAR OF THE WORLDS REVIEW,I liked this movie. The action bits were exciting. And Anthony Piana. Anthony Piana. Shirtless for half the movie. I could see more movies with eyecandy like him. Is there a fanclub where I can get pictures of him?
3,watch-worthy,"Saw H.G. WELLS THE WAR OF THE WORLDS this weekend. And - dang if it didn't stick as close as a movie can to the book itself. I was mighty impressed.Everyone did a lovely job - although the cgi at times was kind of kooky. Anthony Piana as the narrator was a very engaging leading man and John Kaufmann was astonishing as the curate.And my favorite part was the fighters and martians themselves and the singing lady getting waxed. Oh - and until I read the credits, I didn't even realize Anthony Piana also played the brother. Very good.Anyway ... definitely not a big blockbuster, but still watch-worthy."
4,not great but really good,"okay, this is a low budget movie. this is not star wars. get over it. this is a big long miniseries movie. enjoy it for what it is. the people and the martians are deserving of praise. the actors are believable and committed. the direction is good. the costumes rock. the excitement and tragedy hit the mark. the effects are great then goofy then good again. the story is good from start to finish.for the price nothing beats this movie."
3,A TRUE WAR OF THE WORLDS,"This Pendragon Pictures version of THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is flawed and the effects sometimes show. But it is set in the proper period and almost 100% true to the book. So many people don't realize that THE WAR OF THE WORLDS was written in the last part of the 1800's and that the original invasion story was aliens vs. the Victorians. This version does justice to the original telling of the book. It is not about special effects, though there are many. It is about the human survival of such an attack that speaks to our modern troubles. Well worth seeing. this is not a video game with jolting effects every fifteen seconds to make up for the fact that there is no story. This IS the story. The one that lasted in the hearts of fans for over a hundred years."
1,blaw a milion times,"THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE I EVER SAW. ANTHONI'S ""MUSTACH"" IS NOTISILEY FAKE AND IN CLOSE-UPS CAN BE SEEN SLIPPING DOWN. EVERY SEAN WITH CARIDGES HAS A BACKGROUND THAT NEVE MOVES. THERE IS THE MOST STUPIDEST UN-REASINIBLE SEAN IN WITCH PIANA PUTS A STEACK IN HIS WINE GLASS. THE WRITER AND THE BROTHER ARE PLAYED BY THE SAME PEOLPLE. THE MOVIE CONTAINS THREE HOURS UF RUNNING. TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT ITS BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good telling. Mrs. Elphinstone stands out as best.,"Good telling of the novel. Good characters and stories. Best acting moment goes to Mrs. Elphinstone, a frail petite Victorian woman whose husband breaks from her and never returns. Her sister makes her flee the country. Mrs. Elphinstone is amazing. She is beautiful and strong while also frail and on the verge of collapse. Just breathtaking."
4,A spooky and exciting movie.,I saw this movie last night. It was very exciting and the special effects were very spooky and exciting. I loved the acting and the story flowed by and was very involving. I especially liked the tripod fighting machines.
4,Memorable and Fresh.,"If you go in knowing this movie didn't have the billion dollar budget of Spielberg, even the most hardened skeptics will be pleasantly surprised. It commits fully to text of Wells' classic novel and delivers to the screen all the memorable characters and situations with the fresh look of a classic."
4,not bad,This was and interesting spin and movie for good price i paid. I don't feel ripped off. I am satisfied.
4,I liked this story.,I liked this story. It was worth the money I spent. It is a good scence fiction movie and I am placing it in my collection of DVD's.
5,War of the Worlds-Pendragon,"I was waiting to get this DVD as soon as I found Pendragon's website by accident. I was lured by the previews on the site and the Amazon reviews. Although the Amazon reviews were not too favorable I had to get the DVD regardless. I must say that I am glad I did. The story was very close to the novel and the images chilling. The acting was not Hollywood star billing but it was still good and kept me riveted through the whole presentation. In my own limited insight, the editing could have been crisper and the CGI a lot tighter. Music was great and the main star did a wonderful job as did some of the others. I was very pleased to also see in the credits that this was a joint effort by a lot of people who did more parts and technical jobs to bring this to the screen. It had to be a labor of love. I would recommend this movie to any aficionado of H.G. Wells and The War of The worlds."
3,The Real War Of The Worlds.,"Sick of the hollywood hype and want the non-hack job version of War Of The Worlds? This is it. Check this movie out. It's thouroughly enjoyable. Better than the wasted celluloid Hollywood churned out and called War Of The Worlds. This movie is the real War Of The Worlds. Low budget, yeah, but entertaining. The most entertaining War Of The Worlds out there."
4,Best War of the Worlds out there.,"I like Pendragon's War of the Worlds very much. Next to George Lucas, who makes the best sci fiction movies, I like this one. I like this movie as much as I like The Fantastic Four and The Island. It's low budget, but the movie is the best War of the Worlds movie out there."
2,I really wanted to like it!!,"When I first heard about this film I would visit Pendragon's web site every day in anticipation of the movies release. I was disapointed when the release date was put back, but encouraged when I discovered the delay was in order to improve the special effects. Pendragon was promoting an epic to rival the production of the Lord of the Rings.When the movie was released I had to import a copy from the USA as it's not available in the UK.The movie follows the book very close, but those extra special effects are the worst I've ever seen. They are not just low budget they have been produced with the least effort. Dr Who in the 70's at least attempted to make what you saw believable!The begining of the movie is very detailed and the end of it is thrown together. As the movie goes on the effects get worse. Please read some of the other reviews. I'm afraid the bad ones tell it like it is!"
2,Worst of the worlds,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought, Yes!It's gonna be good. Then I found out that the trailer was thebest part of the film. For nearly 3 hours of torture sittngthere watching this movie, Desprate effects, wooden acting,why did they make this movie?. I could write more about thisreview but it's not worth going on. Avoid at all costs!!(watch out for my copy on ebay) Get your hands on the 1953Classic."
1,MST3K Material (Stinkburger),"I really wanted to like this movie, but it repeatedly denied me that pleasure. Its 180 minute runtime could easily have been shortened to a more tolerable 120 minutes by trimming out all of the pointless dramatic pauses and excess footage of people running, walking, and otherwise milling around (not to mention all of the pointless dialog).Even if you can find your way through all the boring dialog, overlook the main character's fake mustache (it almost stares back at you!), and annoyances induced by the plethora of false backgrounds, amateur effects & film-school-drop-out editing, you'll still find yourself bothered by the jumpy/jittery playback evident in almost every scene as if the movie were playing back on an underpowered computer with a painfully slow hard drive."
1,Cheap endless boring ripoff,"Look carefully before you buy. Trying to pass itself off as the Spielberg version, this is just a bad home movie made by idiots. Save your money."
1,"great script, awful budget","this film could have been exeptional if it weren't for the useless effects and soap opera style acting. the designs for the fighting machine were excellent but lacked convincing movement. the martians looked as scary as the teletubbies. if only mr. hines could have afforded a bigger budget, he would have done a better job (good effort) . the only saving grace of the film is that it stuck to the original diologue.still i must add that my five year old son thought it was great."
1,A miracle!,"A miracle this thing actually got released. You almost have to work at making a movie this bad. Nothing I can say will do it justice. I simply can't decide which aspect is worse between the acting, the effects or the shockingly poor timing and drawn out scenes. I give credit for the concept- to FINALLY make a true-to-the-novel version, but the anticipation of such a thing made watching this one that much more bitter. Absolutely painful experience.Went to my Amazon ""Wish List"" for this but unfortunately, there's no ""Wish I never bought this"" button."
1,Worst Piece of Trash Ever,"This is probably the worst and most boring ""film"" I have ever seen. It is so incredibly bad that it is just bad.It looks like it was shot on a home video camera by a chimpanze.This was clearly put out by the distributor in hopes that people would confuse it with the Spielberg production. I see no other reason for this piece of garbage to have seen the light of day. The people who give this ""film"" high marks must have been watching a different movie or be friends with Tim Hines the director. From what I can tell Hines is such an untalented pretentious hack that it boggles the imagination. Some may think this film is so bad it is good. Do yourself a favor, don't waste your time. Stay home and watch some paint dry instead."
1,10 things I never knew about War of the Worlds,"This is billed as the first really faithful version of Wells classic novel. It's certainly very different and I learned a lot. Namely -1. Wells' novel is not set in Woking, England, but in Washington State2. The narrator is not a writer but a Freddie Mercury impersonator years ahead of his time3. Waterloo Station, London looks just like Seattle4. No-one could talk with a proper English accent in England5. The Martian war machines are not solid, so they are able to float through water without disturbing it6. London was a medieval village7. It's entire population was one woman, but she committed suicide8. Big Ben is lighter than air9. Martians look like blancmange10. Even in the middle of the night, the sun shines very, very brightly"
1,Absolutely Dire! Zero Stars If Possible!!,I normally like sci-fi films and TV and can even enjoy B-movie films and programmes. But believe me this DVD is the worst film you will ever see. It has terrible acting - the actor playing Wells looks like a bandit and sound too weedy and carries no authority in the part. And the CGI is the worst you'll ever see - a 3 yeard old kid and an old PC could produce better. Please save your money or give it to charity - just don't buy this DVD! I've already binned my copy; I wouldn't even give it away as it's that bad.
1,Waste of effort,This is heartbreakingly awful. Done by amateurs with amateurish results. From someone who really wanted this to be worthwhile I can only express my total disappointment. This should be used in film school as a textbook account of how not to make a film.
1,Embarrassing,"I'm sorry, but even with so many people trying so hard to state the positive about this film, it is pants. To my mind, nothing works. The feeble attempt to give a feel of pre-war films with colour & jerkiness just looks like an error with the DVD formatting. There is no acting in this film - I can't believe any actor is so bad, so it must have been intended. Why?!!! I do not believe that the film was edited at all - the irrelevant footage left in all through it is mind numbing - how many times do you see the same people going back and forth in the woods or stumbling up and down the slope of the crater in the first half hour? The special effects are dreadful - even on a low budget, technology today can do better than black lines around the superimposed images and fire looking like it has been drawn on badly afterwards. Too long as well. This film reminded me of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" - except that Plan 9 was more entertaining."
1,Extremely Poor Production Values,"I bought this version after reading that it closely followed the plot of the book, but after watching about 45 minutes, I decided I could take no more. The ""choppy"" quality of the video was quite distracting, and even easy scenes to shoot, like a man walking down a path, appear to have been digitally done, and poorly at that. The special effects are perhaps the worst I've seen since the fifties.All in all I would say this is comparable in quality to a project done by college students using amateur equipment and methods.It is one of the few DVDs I have thrown in the trash after purchasing. It is really THAT bad!"
1,Not even worth $8.42 from Walmart.,"I bought this based on favorable reviews from Amazon users. Boy, was I disappointed. While I did enjoy the fact that it was the most faithful adaptation of the book, the stiff acting, editing (or lack thereof), and dreadful special effects render the film nigh-unwatchable. It is also extremely slow-paced. Honestly, this film looks worse than most college student-produced movies I have seen. The special effiects, and even the actors, resemble cardboard cut-outs on sticks being waved around (absolutely the worst mise-en-scene I have ever seen - below even Ed Wood's standards). Do yourself a favor, and read Well's novel if you are really curious about what a Martian invasion in the late 19th Century would be like. Or check out the Little Book of Horror - War of the Worlds by Steve Niles and Ted McKeever. Otherwise, go see Speilberg's movie, which - although not perfect - succeeds at being both entertaining and even somewhat thought-provoking."
1,"Unbelievable, really.","I watched this with a mixture of sorrow and anger.One almost had sympathy for the ineptness of this effort had it not been for the ludicrous claims of its makers promising everything from ""Matrix-style"" special effects to its being 100% faithful to the book...which it is not.It would seem the only idea here was to make a quick buck off the back of the Spielberg version, which is a dreadful underhanded thing to do. It is the only explanation I can think of.The affrontery of passing this off as a legitimate feature film in the end cancelled any sympathy I had for the lack of talent in every single department. Three hours of self-delusion.If they had admitted openly that they only had a few hundred dollars to make this video, my sympathy might have prevailed.It is so amateurish in every way. But lack of money is no excuse for lack of talent.Do the makers truly and honestly believe this to be worthy of the HG Wells book? Really and truly?"
1,An abomination!,"How anyone could mistake this horrible mess for a proper film is beyond me. Acting, directing, photography - all beneath school play standards. And don't get me started on the `special' effects (specially bad!!!). Just another cheapjack junkyard ripoff of a Hollywood blockbuster, don't be suckered like I was. Absolute trash."
5,At Long Last.,"What can you possibly say in a review of a book like this?Well, I guess that if you haven't seen the three previous volumes, this is an attempt on the publishers part to reprint all 18,000, yes, 18,000 of the 'Peanuts' cartoon scripts. This particular volume contains the strips from the years 1957 and 1958 (I bet you didn't get that out of the title).The best thing that I can say is 'it's about time.' And then ask a few questions. Why hasn't this been done before? What's the next strip for which this should be done?I guess that if you don't know 'Peanuts' like if you've been a time warp or something, you'd want to know that this book is complete with Charlie Brown, Snoopy (the hairy face series), Lucy and Linus (Beetoven is here in strength, along with his blanket) and the rest.My only complaint, publish more than two a year. At my age I don't know that I'll still be around in 2016."
4,Great book,"Got this as a gift for a big peanut fan, he loved it. Will be getting other years in the future."
4,Cometh Snoopy,"Here we find the years in which Snoopy becomes more of his own character, rather than just the dog that pops up in various comics. He becomes his own person, develops a complex personality, and, in a way, becomes a voice for Schulz.I loved this set, but found myself laughing 8.9% less (a guesstimate) than in previous years. But don't let that deter you. It's Peanuts, and there's no arguing of Schulz's brilliant imagination."
2,Good Concept But Not Worth It,"First of all, the inserts are tiny (both in length and width). While its a great idea to have a buddy pad in the platform of your pointe shoe, unfortunately, these inserts don't work that way. The adhesive used to apply the inserts to the shoe is very weak and wears off after one class, leaving you with a thin cushion slipping around your shoe. Also, they quickly lose their form and become misshapen. If you're looking for a less padded insert than the standard gel kind, I recommend just buying the thin cloth toe pouches rather than wasting your money on a product that will last one class."
4,Great for toes,They work great for saving your toes while wearing pointe shoes.Use them regularly and think they work very well.
5,INFO.....,"A 2-pack collection of four classic episodes of THE LUCY SHOW. Includes: ""Lucy the Starmaker,"" ""Lucy Meets Robert Goulet,"" ""Main Street U.S.A.,"" and ""Lucy Meets Sheldon Leonard."""
3,"Rod McKuen--""It's my ball and I make the rules.""","This CD (and all the others of this set) present a fine representation of music from the war era, but whatever mood is created is quickly destroyed by the presence of the vocally annoying Rod McKuen covering songs associated with other singers. The guy was a prepubescent child during the war--he has no business taking his place among the singing stars of the war years. Well . . . I have to correct myself--he does have business--he's the producer, and of course, that means he can do whatever he wants which includes allowing his egotism to take a potentially 5-star set down a couple of notches. The tracks are inconsistently documented, but if you feel like taking the time to rip the tracks to mp3s, rename the files, and remove the McKuen tracks, you will have superior set that is well worth listening to. A project for a rainy day."
5,Code Monkeys,My son loves this show...I've ordered Season 2 as well. I gave them to him for Christmas and he said it was the best gift.
5,Awesome,I absolutely love this show. It's like watching a video game which gives the whole series a very unique and refreshing feel. The extras are awesome as well.
4,Retro fun cartoon,Imagine the irreverence of South Park meeting the 8-bit world of computer gaming and you get Code Monkeys.
3,Mindfulness In Plain English,"The broad term meditation covers several techniques or schools of meditation. The subject of this book is ""breath meditation""-- except that the type discussed in this book is a very specialized type of meditation called ""Vipassana"". It is practiced by Budhist devotees. This type of meditation is used to gain insight. It does not involve the use of a mantra, but the breath alone, both in and out, is the focus of attention. This type is different than the other called ""jhana"", which does involves concentrating upon a mantra.The author is very thorough regarding the details of the subject and the technique. He covers in detail the process as well as some the hurdles in this technique."
5,Practical and potentially life-changing,"I found this book to be a wonderfully practical guide to Vipassana. It opens the door, in a helpful, non-jargon way, to this meditation style in a way that anyone can understand. Highly recommended as a possible life-changer."
4,MINDFULNESS IN PLAIN ENGLISH,"This book is elegant in its simplicity & a wonderful learning tool for the novice. If one has an on-going practice, it will serve as great reinforcement."
5,Perfect Book of Wisdom,This is a Perfect book of wisdom for those people that is interested on embarking the true knowledge and practice of Insight Meditation. Highly Recommended by me for those newbies out there. Read this first before you are going to embark in this complex journey.
5,Excelente,"Livro prático, linguagem simples e objetiva. Apresenta o conteúdo de forma bem didática. E, a experincia proposta é indicada para qualquer pessoa."
3,Only for the hard core,"This is a book for which one can only have a great deal of respect but it is heavy going reading. Not really suitable for wimpy meditators. If you have a serious commitment to meditation, and it is not just a fad for you, or something which you find lamentably difficult, then you will probably find the book fantastic, as it does cover just about everything. The thing about meditation though is that you can't really learn how to do it from a book - you need to ""just do it"" (and have an in-flesh teacher to consult). I found this book dry and slightly tortuous to read, even if I do recognise it as the real deal."
5,Helpful,"Since getting into mindfulness and meditation in the past year, sometimes questions come up or one needs motivation to continue the practice. I found that this book really helped give me some much needed answers and motivated me to continue the practice of mindfulness. It is written quite simply and easy to read. I thought it was so worthwhile that I bought this book for a friend for her birthday."
5,Great book for a begginer,"I love this book, my dad recommended it to me, and even that I have been doing meditation for couple of years, it helped me so much, gave me new tips and understanding. It's a great book for someone who is looking for simple and effective tools and guidelines for their meditation practice, without ideology or religious ideas. I just bought another one for my boyfriend, it's a great book to read of you are just trying to find out what meditation is all about."
5,Probably the best place to start,"Words cannot accurately convey how well this book gets across all of the important ideas about meditation. If you are at all considering meditation or anything close to Eastern philosophy I highly recommend finding a copy.The depth of knowledge Gunaratana possesses is incredible since few have ever managed to capture so much about an action (meditation is ultimately about doing, not conceptualizing) in words. The book is very quiet in tone as opposed to trying to preach any dogma, yet there is much humour here too. Even those with well-worn zafus will enjoy this book; the novice will find the advice invaluable.If you want to have one book about meditation on your shelf, this would be a good choice."
3,One way of meditating,Be aware that this is a Buddhist monk teaching a method of Buddhist meditation. There are many types of meditation and mindfulness which are not covered. Just keep that in mind while reading this book.
2,"Too hard, no fun!","My expectations were very high given the reviews.However, I was quite disappointed by this book.It makes mindfullness and meditation seem too difficult and much like a chore.Especially since its called ""in plain english"", you would think it would be more accessible for beginners.It repeatedly talks about how mindfullness is difficult, hard work, etc...I disagree.If you want a very accessible book about mindfullness, try Eckhart Tolle's book ""The Power of Now"".You might also try ""A New Earth"" by Tolle, or one of Jon Kabat Zinn's books."
5,Amazing.,"Although it's available online for free, I definitely recommend picking up a copy here. Just so convenient and easy on the eyes. Also gives you an opportunity to write notes on each page.The style of this book is super down to earth. The content is solid, incredibly practical and freshly presented with modern language and minimal use of Buddhist jargon. The book also (clearly from the title) goes straight to the heart of the matter, emphasizing a cultivation of mindfulness: an impartial but attentive and consistent observation of ones mind and senses. This is an extremely effective path to balance and greater well being."
4,Easy read,Meditation explained in simple understandable language!Conversational tone with anecdotal tales interwoven throughout.A very good read and a good handbook for the art ofMeditating.
5,Mindfullness In Plain English,This is a fantastic book on Mindfulness. It is clearly written (by an expert) and very easy to read and understand.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about Mindfulness.
3,Useful but repetitive.,"As a novice, I learned quite a bit from this book, but the author was a bit repetitive at times for my tastes. It covers the basic of meditation well, but toward the end I simply got tired of the phrase ""loving friendliness"" because he repeats it so many times redundantly trying to illustrate his thoughts."
5,Clear prose that is easy to digest,"There is a reason that this work is one of the best-selling mindfulness books of all time. The language is clear, the presentation is organized, and the advice is practical in a way that is completely missed by some of the Swami Dingdong volumes that are out there.Mindfulness is about practice, and one can't practice if one isn't given concrete ways to do it. Doesn't that seem really obvious? Yet I can't count the number of books I have scoped out on ""mindfulness"" and ""mindful meditation"" that discuss the nuts and bolts of technique in only peripheral and minimal ways.This is a superior text in that regard. You will not be disappointed."
5,Fantastic book,This is really is a great book that fills the gap that one might need to start meditating. Wish I found this book years ago when I started.
3,interesting,Definetly a book worth reading if you want to know what mindfulness is. Sometimes books use words that do not mean anything for us mortals :). This book will really help you grasp what is mindfulness & meditation and with very helpful and simple excercises.
5,EXCELLENT,I love forensic files show and this DVD cnsists of over 10 different episodes. Excellent quality + very fast shipping.I recommend this DVD to anybody interested in knowing more about forensics.
4,Needs to be Updated,"Well organized, researched, and interesting to read. Keep in mind it was written in the 80s so alot of changes have been made in these areas since."
5,great book!,"This book not only offers training tips, but racing strategies and most important- inspiration. I found the look at the mental side of running to be incredibly motivating, and i couldn't wait to get on my shoes and run out the front door. I re-read parts of it before races, just to keep up my mental fitness as well as my physical. I recommend this to ANY runner."
4,A revised version of better runs,"When I bought this book I thought it would be a book like better runs but with completely new essays. When I got the book, I noticed that it wasn't really much more than a revised version of Better runs. There's absolutely nothing wrong with the content of this book -- it gives you great running advice. But if you've read Better runs, there's not much new to learn from this book. It does contain some new insights, so it still might be worth the purchase if you enjoy reading Henderson's work."
4,Good,"Worth the price. Nothing special. Feels a tad flimsy, but its just a bag holder for a cabinet. Would recommend."
5,SKETCH BOOK,"MY SON WAS VERY PLEASED. THESE BOOKS ARE VERY HELPFUL WITH ART STUDENTS. NOW HE HAS THE BOOK TO SHOW HIM HOW TO DRAW, BUT ALSO HIS ART TEACHER AT SCHOOL."
5,One of the greatest manga books i've seen!!!,This book is fantastique! As soon as I saw it I was hooked! I could not leave it. I just HAD to have it!! As of then I have been using that book whenever I feel like drawing mang! (Wich I do alot!)
3,Don Don Don Dooooooon,"I dunno.This book is more infomative on the fantasy genre then it is on how to draw it. Though, it has some useful info on things you want to think about when U draw these things.Christopher Hart hires other artists to draw the book for him. So if U don't like one drawing style theres always others. On the flipside that means that Harts teaching U a drawing style he can't draw.This isn't a book I would get( I borrowed it from the library). However there are great illo's."
4,Pretty good fantasy book,"It has how to draw quite a few of the characters-like knights, princesess, fairies, fragons, etc. Has some good turn arounds, and great pictures. Would have liked more infomation on how to draw the armor and clothes for people, and how to do medevial villages."
2,Not All Its Said To Be..,"Quiet honestly the one thing that makes Chrisopher Hart's books on Anime and Manga ""less"" than others is the fact that he isn't very good at it. Oh, he makes some good points, especially when comparing American comic drawing with manga style drawing, but there are better books out there.If this is all that is available then you won't be to dissapointed in buying it, but being as they are usually around $20 (at least where I am) then you might want to get your moneys worth and stick around for one of Hikaru Hayashi's many How to Draw Manga books as they are usually more detailed and better drawn."
3,If not for the drawings I'd say it's a little kidish one....,"This books O.K. It tells you how to draw four type sof dragons,faeries, ""gothic creatures"", and some si-fi stuff. He tells you all this stuff, but in doing so I think he might be limiting your imagination by saying ""here's how you draw this and that"". Whatever. I think he would be better off by adding ""here's the basic anatomy of a person(front and back), here's some armor variations, weapon variations, basic clothing folds, dragon skin options, maybe what a medevial town looks like, and all that.He Does tell you how to do turn arounds, and some of the pictures in this book are dang tight!Maybbe I'm picky, but I think those pictures in there should in pencil so he(Christopher Hart) wouldn't be lording over you with his fancy inked-and-colored pictures. This book isn't that bad, though. Drawing these things using his step-by-step instructions will improve your drawing skills."
3,Slow To Arrive,"I waited a long time for this to arrive from the retailer. It arrived in a thin, plastic wrapping that had a slight tear near one of the corners of the book. Luckily, there was no damage to the product. As for the book itself, I actually like it. It has many different things to draw, and explains the differences in styles. It mainly focuses on Medieval and Sci-Fi worlds. It's not my favorite How-To-Draw book, even on these topics, BUT for the price and the variety of projects, it has a welcomed spot on my shelf."
4,A tech-house album including Kevin's signature techniques.,"I purchased this cd after seeing Kevin Saunderson and Derrick May do a 4 turntable tag team in Oakland. Before hand, I have always heard many thing about Kevin and about him pioneering the techno revolution in Detroit. That party blew me away, because I haven't heard good deep techno for quite a while and they both used the fader for muting techniques we all love to hear. I was pleased to hear a well mixed cd and some of Kevin's signature scratching methods. All in all, the cd is worth the price and you might want to check out the Video put out for this soundtrack."
5,My favorite mix since Carl Cox FACT ONE,"I love this CD. Kevin goes deep into tribal funk techno by way of Detroit, and comes out the end with some of his own more banging tracks. Overall, a very satisfying mix. This mix suffers none of the quality issues with some of the DJ Kicks mixes by other Detroit artists, it is well-mixed and well-produced.I bought this disc about five years ago and still listen to it often. I'm a huge fan of Detroit techno, and this is the best mix I have."
4,deeeeeeeeeeeeep spaaaaaaaaace...,"Kevin Saunderson sounds like he's having fun broadcasting this, now defunct, radio show- as a chance to hook it up for those who weren't in Motown for the actual show when it used to air... the mixing, voice-overs, and that heavy bassline... it made some very entertaining listening."
3,Strangely unsatisfying....,"When I first saw the track listing for this mix CD I thought I would be blown away, however Saunderson mixes some fantastic tracks very safely, almost too safely for my liking. The mix threatens to take off all the time but never really hits the heights. I would, however, strongly recommend this mix to the uninitiated as a guide to the funkier side of Detroit."
4,Nice boring bar set,"I have been using this set to bore 1.5"" holes in structural steel with good results. The set is of Chinese manufacture, but it seems to be made well enough. The shanks are precision ground and the brazed carbide tips seem secure. Some of the machine work on the business end of the bars is coarse and obviously done by hand, but these complaints are just cosmetic. The set works just fine."
1,Worst Movie(if you can call it that) Of All Time,"As the title of my review states This is the worst thing put on film that I have ever seen avoid it at all costs!The Acting(haha) Directing,Story,Plot and everything else about this flick.well it SUCKS! It just ain't no damn good!! It Most defenitly does not deserve any stars, but to write a review I had to give it at least one. I too want my money back from the rental place, I could make a better western with my Kids and a Cam-Corder!!STAY AWAY STAY FAR AWAY!!"
1,Deceptive description - quantity is 100 softgels not 300,"The headline says: ""Carlson Laboratories - A & D, 300 softgels"", which I interpreted as quantity = 300.But the package quantity is actually 100.Screenshot: [...]I expect that this is unintentional, but it's nonetheless deceptive.Sad, because the actual price for 300 softgels is quite attractive.Fix the headline, and all will be good."
3,This book is not well organised,"The book is not well organise, and cotains a lot of mistakes. For example, in Chapter 5, the author starts with membrane plate element, switch to 3D solid mechanics, come back to plate bending element again, and finally go on to talk about free vibration problem in rod! Trying to figure out the motivation of each chapter is a pain in the neck."
2,1-2 and 3 but 4......,"I have all 4 season of That Girl. I am a huge fan. To give my rating you have to undrstand how I got there. I have seen seasons 1-3 about 6 times each since I first purchased them.Season 4 I have only seen once. I didnt want to see the episode again. That is highly unusal for me. It is not bad.. It's that I found the episode too silly and not written as good as the other seasons.However, I am a fan always and will purchase any future That Girl dvd's"
1,Dumb,"Not in English, and looks like it was made by high school kids with a digital video camera.Don't rent it. I didn't last 5 minutes. Waste of money."
2,So bad it was funny,"This ""movie"" (spoof) was SO bad it was funny. Unfortunately in my desire to get this for my husband, in my haste I didn't read all the description or comments. It was in another language with subtitles. There was no other choice but that, so reading it was distracting from the ""action"". But my husband liked it. But if anyone wants to buy it from us, please get in touch."
2,Some jokes just don't translate well.,"Translating jokes from English to Finish and then back again, just doesn't work.The CGI is better than average and the actors seem to enjoy their roles, butit is not a good movie."
1,It was boring and really hard to read..,Once you get past his odd way of writing it gets interesting
2,Very elimentary,"I recommend you get a 1 month subscription to live charts. To the reader who said his 3 trades were successful due the book, I have been returning 20% consistently month over month without ever picking up a stock book."
3,Hmmmm...,"I want to say this is an interesting book...but all it taught me was how much time some people have to spend researching stocks to find good moves, thats why i switched to learning how to trade emini futures....and no PDT law either!! bada bing bada boom! For the high price and fairly empty pages...i dunno. Its pretty straightforward with the moves he looks for...just didnt do anything or me. Seems like a book for those who are already cosistent traders and want more ideas....zzzz"
1,Book can be read in 30 minutes,I have read over 30 books on trading and find this to be the least informative. I thought I got a good deal by buying both Coopers books at a bundle price of $160 but I read both books in less than 30 minutes without having to take any notes or stop to think. Its like using a manual type writter in the age of computer automation.
5,"Useless ""Step In Front of Size""","Mr. Cooper highlights ""Step in Front of Size"" as one of his super strategies. It is unknown why he doesn't bother to inform the reader that he needs Nasdaq level II quotes to do this. Otherwise nobody would ever be able to use this strategy. It took me some time to figure this out, no thanks to this guy."
1,Useless as it does not deal with exits and money mgmt,"As reviewer ""Pedro Suarez"" points out, the author does not provide exit strategies! This is just insane. How can one enter a trading position using a mechanical strategy, then just pick the exit (you have to exit the trade at some point, don't you?) ""based on ... instincts"" and ""experience alone"" (chap. 17 of the book)! This shows something is fishy about the guy's entry strategies. Maybe another reviewer is right in saying these are nothing but plain-word descriptions of Japanese candlesticks (of which I know little). Also, there's no money management rules. You can't write a trading book that comes anything close to being useful without talking about exits and money management, period."
3,Good Stuff,"Overall not bad. Huge lettering and uses only half a page(or less) sometimes. Some good setups but, he gives bare-bones descriptions..."
3,Excellent Book!,This is the best book on trading I have ever read. I have utilized the strategies on a daily basis and have consistantly made money. Thank you Jeff for writing the best book ever! I will never return this book or loan it out to anyone. I give you my highest rating of three stars out of three stars.
3,Artificial,"The songs are good, the piano playing is smooth and easy but the artifical accompaniment is at times loud, annoying and too driven. All in all though a good disk to have."
5,Amazing!,"I am a HDTV addict but refuse to buy the ""latest & gratest"". I have 5 HDTV sets from a 32"" to a 120"" projection setup that range from 1080i to 1080p but this set is by far the best picture of the bunch. I purchased this unit to put in a plasma lift cabinet that was designed to hold ""up to"" a 50"" plasma but I prefer the look of LCD over plasma. I was going to put a 47"" LCD in it but when I found this slim 52"" I had to see if it would fit. Not only did it fit - it is now my favorite set in my home."
2,Large and slow are a bad combination.,"I bought this TV and returned it a week later, because it blurred so badly with motion that sports were unwatchable. I ended up buying a smaller Sony XBR4, and I have none of the issues (plus the picture is far, far better).This has nothing to do with 60 vs 120Hz. That is more important for DVDs and Blu-Ray signals that are 24fps (which doesn't divide evenly into 60 but does for 120). The LT52133 has an 8ms response time, which is extremely slow. A decent LCD should be 5 or lower.If you want an LCD, choose speed and quality over size. If you want size and quality but want to spend less, buy a plasma. Don't buy a big, cheap, slow LCD!I gave it 2 stars because I like the interface and remote."
2,Disappointed,"I bought the Mitsubishi LT-52133 52"" LCD a couple of weeks ago thinking I was buying a good leading brand name tv. Not So.I don't know if it is because the refresh rate is only 60hz, but a lot of the time the picture looks smeared. When someone is talking or when there is a close up of someones face, as they move around it looks like their nose and cheeks can't keep up with their movements making the picture look smeared. At times this is really bad and makes it hard to watch the tv at all.I am really disappointed in the picture quality of this tv, and would advise against buying one. I emailed Mitsubishi about this and got no reply."
5,"LATELY ,BY DIVINE IS THE GREATEST.","I WILL PURCHASE THIS SONG FOR ALL OF MY FRIENDS. IT IS THE PERFECT SONG FOR A BROKEN HEART.EVERY- TIME I HEAR IT,IT BRINGS TEARS TO MY EYES.ANYONE WHO IS GOING THROUGH A BAD RELATIONSHIP WILL UNDERSTAND IT'S MEANING."
5,A study of human weakness and group think,"I think some of the readers didn't ""get the point"". The point of this book is that a simple young woman should be allowed to be JUST THAT. Why are the intellectuals here not getting that simple people have a right to their simple existence? That fascist totalitarian governments strip individuals of their basic rights. The point is: thugs took over a world power by brainwashing and manipulating a whole bunch of simpletons. Lots of simpletons went along with hate-mongering politics out of personal greed or fear. This book attempts to show how intellectuals rationalize this manipulation and then turn on each other, which ultimately just feeds more power to those up top. Vast groups of innocents suffer for the gain of few. Sound eerily familiar? This book is a classic, epic, snapshot of government gone bad that every citizen should read. It has far reaching implications regardless of heritage, race, or nationality."
5,Out of this world,"I have enjoyed the Midsommers murders since they have been on t.v. I really like the dectives, they compliment each other and it is fun to watch them work together. The story line is fun and it keeps you interested as you watch the plot unfold and also you get to see their countryside. It also lets you know that we are not the only one who have murders that take place in your own country."
4,OMG!,This specific boxed set has the Episode Judgement Day. In that episode the 22 yr. old Orlando Bloom makes one of his first on screen appearances.
3,Legolas in Midsomer,Orlando Bloom plays the local rogue. Interesting to see him as the bad boy before Lord of the Rings and Pirates of the Caribbean.
5,I found this book useful as an expectant and new Mom,"Being pregnant at the time this book was published, it was very useful. I found this book a great guide to actions I could use daily. The book also gave me confirmation for many things I had already ""gotten away with"" while being pregnant. Humerous and Helpful. I highly recommend for every expecting Mother!"
2,not what i expected,"This book was not helpful. I was expecting insightful information, and was disappointed. I would not recommend this book for a first time mother."
4,"Would be a perfect soundtrack for ""Mutant Message""","Perhaps the most acoustic of all Jon Hassell albums, ""Flash of the Spirit"" unites him with the African rhythm group Farafina, who provide a vivid rhythmic foundation for Hassell's trumpeted meanderings. A single, sustained note starts the proceedings and, one by one, awakens the other intruments, which pulse, rise, fall and return throughout the hour-long album. The second half seems like a more pensive restating of the first half--that is, until ""Blue(Prayer),"" which closes the album. ""Blue"" is twelve minutes of hypnotic dreamtime propelled by a two-note bass line that simulates the deep breathing of a mountain. It's all a vicarious experiencing of indigenous human life; it is surprising not to hear more of Hassell on movie soundtracks. An earthy harbinger of ""City: Works of Fiction,"" ""Flash of the Spirit"" is a hard-to-find jewel in Hassell's amazing body of work."
2,Don't expect to get anywhere with this one...,"I ordered this atlas and then sent it back. The maps have no detail whatsoever, and it doesn't show any streets, just major highways. Maybe it would be good for people who would be traveling a lot on the highways in France. But once you get somewhere you'll be out of luck because it doesn't show the streets of towns."
3,VERY TIME CONSUMING,"It takes too long to cover the grays with this product. You have to keep wetting the stick, and it drips color when you dampen it."
4,Light A Single Candle,"This was a good book, It's about a girl named Cathy who becomes blinde, she is a very pretty girl.She falls in love with a guy,she thinks that the guy won't like her because she is blind.She figures out that he really likes her for who she is.I would recommand this book for someone who likes reading books about the main character trying for something, but don't get it til the end of the book.This book had many different emotions."
5,Fantastic book!,"I read this book when I was in junior high school, and loved it. When I was recently diagnosed with glaucoma, I remembered the book, and re-read it. Even at age 44, I still loved it!"
5,Am now 28 and still enjoy this one!,"I am near sighted and one of my worst fears in this world is going blind. This book, however, showed me that most of our fears are only fed by the society we live in. Cathy's triumph in overcoming this obstacle is a sure way of showing anyone the true meaning of living. Enjoy this book and cherish it...Share it but don't give it away. I bet you'll need it again some day!"
4,An polished jewel of 70's era Soul,"How this title managed to get buried so deep inside of the Stax catalog of classic material I don't know. What I do know that is Ghetto: Misfortune's Wealth easily holds company with some of the better know heavyweights of Stax Records lore (Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes etc).Soulful grooves and thought provoking consciencous lyrics are blended together beatuifully. Your bound to have heard (although without really having much of an idea that it was from this project) a lot of material on this CD sampled by some of hip hop giants including Rakim,Dr. Dre & KRS-One.This is a must have for the collection! Don't Sleep."
1,Angry and Disappointed,"This order was never received. The seller did not respond to several emails and phone calls. Only through Amazon intervention was I able to learn the seller did not have the product in stock. My funds were returned to my account. Happily, I was able to locate the ring from another source. I trust Amazon and will continue to purchase items here. However, I can not recommend this seller and I definitely will never use it again."
5,An absolutely delightful children's mystery!,"This was one of my absolute favorite children's books when I was a child, and one of the reasons I remain a tremendous fan of the work of William Pene du Bois. The book is a wonderfully wry, funny tale of a young boy detective's investigation of a mysterious theft that just happens to take place when the circus is in town, and it's a story that my parents enjoyed as much as I did. The hero is smart and likeable and the secondary characters--from the town's bumbling police patrolman to the many eccentric members of the circus are tremendously entertaining. I'd recommend this book for children seven and up--and for their parents, whom I'm sure will enjoy reading it aloud as much as my father did!"
1,feminist jewish propaganda - dont waste your money!,"full of psychobabble and whining, signifying nothing. everyone suffers but this editor seems to have a penchant for choosing the authors that wallow in their misery. I for one am exhausted by all the pissing and moaning by liberal elites who need to make a career out the tragedies of history. This person, Loolwa Khazzoom, should get an honest job instead of riding her high horse around, crying about injustices that are in the past and are not going to be remedied."
5,Speaking Truth,I bought this book for my synagogue library and sat down and read it myself in the space of two days. The essays are enlightening and disturbing; they tear the heart and encourage the Jewish family to acknowledge all of its members. Blessings on the editor and these essayists for bringing these words to us.
1,Bad Mitsubishi,"Although Mitsubish may be ranked highly, they fail miserably in the customer service dept. Light engine went out on TV. It has been four months and still not repaired yet. Over the last three weeks I have called Mitsubishi Consumer Relations 3-4 times a day to try to get an answer. Sometimes they will transfer your call to 'Level 2' Consumer Relations, at times they refuse. Their response is always 'part will be shipped in 7-10 business days'. Four months later it is still the same excuse.Highly disappointed in Mitsubishi. What really upsets me is that the TV is for my elderly mother who is confined to the house and this wonderful product of theirs has been sitting in the living room inoperable for four months. There was no offer to replace the TV. This is how they treat their customers and the elderly. Will never buy Mitsubishi product again.Also, the menu is not user friendly. Sony is much better."
3,"Great picture, but...","power center failed after one day. I understand this is not an uncommon problem. To Amazon's credit, they offered a full refund and paid for return shipping. I ordered a replacement from another source, as Amazon could not ship another for 4-6 weeks. The replacement WD-73734 just arrived. Again, great picture with no distracting electronic hum as mentioned in other posts. I found the manual hard to follow when attempting to integrate an AVR receiver, and one HDMI ""auto-sense"" port did not ""auto-sense"" the HDMI input. I also noted picture alignment problems resulting in a minor barreling of the image. Not enough to require a service call or return the unit, but enough to question Mitsubishi's quality control. Other posts have mentioned less than optimal experiences with Mitsubishi customer support, so I won't even attempt to call them.If you want a beautiful high definition television, this is it. However, I am keeping my fingers crossed..."
5,My Home Town,"Great description of when I grew up in Chicago (1932-1952), which I left for the Air Force in 1952. Rarely visited after that, but found great changes when I did visit. I enjoyed particulary the maps and pictures of how the city was while I was maturing and going to school. I recommend this book for anyone living there now or in the past."
5,great bit,I use these bits for plug boring on ipe. Best ones I can find. Need six more words bro head.
4,Some Great Stuff,"While some of the tracks on this disc are not as well known as those on the first ""Top of Stax"" CD, it is still a really good collection of songs recorded at the legendary STAX recording studio in Memphis. This collection gives a listener more of the sounds that made STAX such a unique and memorable place to record music."
1,"Packaging sucks, no product",Ordered some acetal rod and some steel rod and there wasn't anything in the tube when I received it. Poor packaging. I won't order again.
4,plastic part came undone,"My son loves his helmet. he is 15 months and always wants to wear it. The only thing i can say bad about it is that we left it outside and the plastic part on top came loose from the ""tape"" wrapped around. it's hard to explain. i wish i would send a picture of what i'm talking about. we still use it and it doesn't get in the way. it just seemed cheaply made. buy at your own risk."
3,Funtional but low quality,"This helmet is super cute and fits my toddler well, however, the first time it was left in our car on a summer day the blue outer layer warped from the heat and we don't even live in a very warm place! It's still usable, just looks funny."
4,Does the job but...,"This does what it's supposed to do which is protect a little head from getting hurt if there were a biking accident. It's really cute. My son wears it, not happily, when we're out biking and he's in his trailer. My biggest complaint is he gets SOOO sweaty wearing it, his hair is soaked, and then it's very difficult to take off. I know helmets aren't that comfortable when it comes to keeping heads cool but it seems the venting could possibly be a little larger."
4,very good,"My Grandson loved the design, makes him happy to put it on. The helmet is of good quality and fits him well."
5,my grandson's first helmet,"My grandson turned 2 this month, and I bought him a bike with the helmet.he loves it!!!!!My daughter called me to say that he refuses to take it off.they live in the west coast so he will have lots of fun with it.I'm very happy with my purchase.Bell Zoomer Toddler Bicycle Helmet (Blue Googley Eyes Spider)."
4,Good Helmet,"My son loves trains, and I love Bell helmets--so this matches both of our preferences! It's a little hard to adjust the straps at first, but overall seems very durable but not heavy for his little head. :)"
2,It's Pink!,"This item is too gendered, the ladybugs are not red like the image, they're pink. The straps are not pictured, they're pink too. If you and your child is into pink, it's perfect. If not, stay away."
5,A fantastic insight into italian-american culture,"A awe-inspiring view of Brooklyn in the 1950's. The storyline was very believable as it displayed the passion and anger of Sicilian society. Marco's honesty and physical strength against the insanity and perverted thoughts of Eddie towards Catherine, was the perfect ending to a intricate struggle of loyalty versus human integrity."
4,Excellent Book,This play is a very intriguing play and I find it very interesting to study. It is my set book for IGCSE examinations which I am writing this year and I definitley enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to anyone.
3,Turn on the subtitles!,"THE HARD WORD (or words, meaning no one gets hurt) is a dandy little Australian film that tells a entertaining tale about three brothers who are periodically let out of prison to do 'jobs' for an outsider (in fact, a lawyer who is sleeping with the girfriend [Rachel Grifiths] of one of the brothers [Guy Pierce]). Each of the three brothers has a distinct personality which is well played by the generally excellent cast: this comraderie of the brothers makes the story clever, very funny at times, and warmly engaging. The film seems like a low budget romp but the cast and director and writer play it to the hilt. The main problem is with the exceedingly heavy Australian outback accents which, when superimposed on a musical score and soundtrack that is far too loud, are nearly undecipherable. Turn on the subtitles option on the DVD and you'll have a much better time enjoying this caper."
1,Mouse Pointer moves erratically. I gave up on it.,"I purchased this mouse. I installed it and noticed the mouse pointer would move suddenly all around the screen. I looked the problem up at the Microsoft sight and they gave me a page of about 35 registry changes which I had to make to try to correct. The changes had to be made after you un-installed the driver, hence you had to work with out a mouse. What a major ordeal. Many other people had the same problem. The fix they gave me did not work. I just bought a logitect laser mouse. Microsoft needs to get their act together on this mouse. I can not recommed it to anyone."
3,Could have been better,I like the feel of this mouse quite a bit but it could be better. First it feels cheap like most Microsoft mice and keyboards. Also the two left buttons are very loose and too easy to press. The scroll button does not croll sideways which is an unusual feature to leave out of this mouse. Why Microsfot is billing it as a gaming mouse is beyond me since its dpi is pretty low. I bought a Logitech G5 instead and it has been near perfect.
5,Good mouse,"I first started using this mouse at work. I liked it so much I had to find it online so I could use it at home, too. It's very comfortable and responsive. I highly recommend this mouse."
5,Three and a half years later...,"I ordered this item in February of 2008 and it's survived a few moves, being thrown in boxes, being used every day, etc. Hardy little guy. The scroll wheel is now getting a bit crunky, but this is still one of the most solid mice I've ever used, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy one again if this one wears out."
2,"good for ~1 year, then stopped working","This mouse was great for about a year, then the left click button wore out, and started to double click every time I clicked once. Searching the web I was surprised to find this was common, as I've never had a mouse wear out before... Overall very disappointed in this mouse's durability, and will stay clear in the future."
2,Lasted 18 months,"Now my primary L click is having issues. This was 20 minutes ago that I replaced it with another mouse that I had laying around. No more L click issues post change. I bought this in March of 2011 hoping for long term, I suppose 18 months is long term, maybe. 200 L clicks a day (estimate average) x 545 days (roughly) = approximately 110000 clicks. Read other reviews saying the same time frame, year and a half before issues."
5,Really Great Mouse,"I've been using Microsoft's Intellimouse products for many years. The one I've been using for the past 10 years finally bit the dust (note: I'm NOT a gamer, but do use my computer a whole lot). I didn't realize this was a gaming mouse until I received it. I'm very pleased with this product. My only ""complaint"" is that I can't find any instructions regarding how to customize the 5 buttons ... or do I not need to know this information if I'm using it just as an ""ordinary"" mouse?"
4,Good mouse,"It feels good in the hand, not too heavy and not too small. I bought mine used so I have a few problems with the side buttons, though they function decently regardless. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good general purpose mouse."
5,Just like my original mouse,I bought an Alienware computer back in 2005 and the included mouse was an Intellimouse 3.0. It started going bad a few months ago so I decided to buy a replacement. This new one is exactly like the old one so there is no learning curve. It performs exactly as my old one did when it was new.
3,Great features . . . But a little clunky,"Was looking for a good ""wired"" mouse for my MacBook Pro that was deadly accurate. Have several wireless versions but grew tired to changing batteries. Did some research on the net and found the Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer 3.0 came very highly recommended for graphic professionals.The Intellimouse is loaded with a host of features you can read about in the product description and those do not disappoint. However personally, I found the mouse to be fairly large and bulky for my size hand. Feels uncomfortably large. The wheel in the center has a rough ""clunk, clunk"" when you rotate and is not smooth at all.Otherwise, the mouse performs as advertised."
4,"Accurate and responsive, poor scroll wheel","I have only owned this mouse for a week and so far so good. It is accurate and responsive. I've been using it for web site design and printshop work where small movements are necessary for accuracey. It fits my hand nicely and is comfortable to use. The optical sensor works perfectly on my desktop so no more mouse pad. I bought this unit knowing it was billed as a gaming mouse with the idea that if it would hold up for gamers banging it around then my use certainly would not strain it. Let us see if that theory holds up. Software downloaded without a hitch using XP. I would have given it 5 stars except for the scrolling wheel. It, for a lack of a better word, feels clunky. It rattles and is noisy. Seems cheap."
3,loud scroll wheel,"The mouse feels pretty good and left and right click are ok. The scroll wheel is way too loud. Everytime you scroll it sounds like you're climbing a big hill on a rollercoaster, click, click, click.It almost feels a bit loose and broken I'll try it for awhile and see if i can get used to it."
1,Very bad 2nd edition of a good mouse,"The original Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer 3.0 was a great mouse I used it for 4 years. The old one deserves without doubt 5 stars. This is a 2nd edition manufactured to much lower standards. The mouse wheel is very loude inprecise and hard to turn. The ""back"" button on the side gives no feedback you never know when you pressed it. Sometimes it does not respond at all.I returned this mouse and got the Logitech MX 518, also a older designe but manufactured today to the same high quality as years ago."
2,Would be great if the left mouse button would stop breaking,"This is the 2nd Intellimouse Explorer 3.0 that I've owned where the left mouse button has stopped working. The first one lasted me about 5 years before breaking. The 2nd one only lasted 30 days!Based on other articles I've found, it seems the most common problem is that the cord coming out of the front of the mouse gets bent and the connections inside break, causing intermittent left mouse button problems. If this common problem didn't exist, I would recommend this mouse over anything else. Unfortunately, all the ergonomic design and precision in the world is worthless when your mouse stops working!"
5,Tried and True,"Have used this mouse with CAD for years, and like the programmability of the buttons. It makes work faster."
5,Great Mouse,"Fits hand perfectly, I put my Logitech G9 and Steel Series Ikari mouse away and use this one. Love it. The case of the unit feels a bit cheap, but what do you expect when paying $20 for a mouse. The tracking ability of this mouse is what makes it so good. It's worth buying."
1,Its Too Noisy!,"the mouse itself works fine but it just has a very cheap feel to it, not like my old microsoft mouse. Just feels and looks like cheap plastics, the scroll button feels like its going to fall off plus its noisy! It squeaks it rattles... Should of read the most recent reviews as this appears to be the 2nd batch of the original... a poorly made batch..."
1,Returned It,"The buttons are far too sensitive, especially the right mouse button. I also had to move my mouse sensitivity all the way up to get it just close to the proper sensitivity. My previous mouse worked fine with the sensitivity set at 1/4. The shape of the mouse is great. I would have been very happy with it if it didn't have these two major flaws."
3,"Great mouse, if it were the original","My original Microsoft Intellimouse lasted more than 6 years before it started acting up. Figuring this would be of similar quality, I replaced it with this particular version (IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0). In just under a year the scroll-wheel broke and six months later the right-click button was double-clicking when it should have been single-clicking. This is not the same IntelliMouse. It's a great mouse only if you don't mind it crapping out on you in a year."
3,Too wide for extended use.,"I'm extremely disappointed with the design quality of this mouse compared to the original IM Explorer.The right side of the mouse flares out instead of being indented, which makes this mouse much wider than the original, even though its not obvious from the photographs.This forces you to try and lay you hand flat and open while pushing the mouse around, which is very bad for the wrist. Its like trying to push a dinner plate around my desktop. After only 15-20 minutes of use my wrist was sore and I can use the regular IM Explorer for 10-12 hours a day with no problems at all.If you can handle a 'plus-sized' mouse, this might be OK for you."
3,new mouse same old problem,just like the original intellimouse explorer 3.0 the mouse wheel is flakey. clicking the left mouse button can sometimes cause the mousewheel to trigger and will totally mess you up (this is especially annoying when gaming). get a logitech this mouse is cheaply made.
2,See/Feel in person before buying,My big con:The scroll detents caused my entire mouse to vibrate each time it passed a 'click' on the wheel.Pros:The mouse is a very comfortable shape and the material used for the foot pads allows it to glide very smoothly.
1,Scroll wheel makes this a horrible mouse,"On every scroll wheel mouse I've ever used, the scroll wheel was smooth, silent and firm. How hard is that to do? The wheel on this mouse, is loud, rough and wobbly. It feels cheap, it sounds cheap and if scrolls in a cheap manner. This mouse replaces an older 3.0 mouse (which was great), and it is garbage. I can't return it because I've opened it, obviously, but this trend of making everything cheaper and cheaper(quality, not cost), has reached the point of diminishing returns. I will not buy another Microsoft mouse. Stay away from this garbage. 3.0 was good, but no more."
5,Mouse Is Anything But Louse,"We needed a new mouse for the Mac we use to power our entire salon operation. This one is a real work horse. Fast, easy to use, very ergonomic. A winner."
2,Rather upset,"I ordered this mouse specifically for the flat black rubbery surface pictured and mentioned in the reviews.But the one I got is silvery plastic.No rubber at all.I do not want another one unless it has the right surface, but who can I ask to make sure this happens ?Who ?To be fair, I understand that everyone likes this mouse but I didn't even try it out since I only ordered it for the rubber buttons and it didn't have them.But I can tell you that it is huge. Because it is not cheap I sent it back unopened for a full refund which Amazon were very good about."
1,Worst scroll wheel ever,"This mouse has some good features: programmable buttons and a comfortable (although almost too large) shape. But it has absolutely the worst scroll wheel I have ever seen. It is loud, very slow (even setting the software at maximum speed), and has a very cheap and wobbly feel to it. It also does not scroll reliably in all types of files. It's actually quite distracting when trying to do any work, so much so that I find it unusable. I liked the Microsoft Notebook Optical Mouse 4000 (liked it a lot in fact!), and thought this would be a similar desktop model, but the Intellimouse Explorer 3.0 is nothing like the notebook model. Am returning it."
2,Uhh,"Well the reviews were accurate, I should have not taken a chance on this one. It simply wasn't designed well enough. The scroll wheel is very loud, and provides too much resistance. The buttons are all pressed too easily for my taste and the side buttons need to be pressed in really far for them to click.The design of this mouse is there but the basic engineering of it seemed like noone ever tested it. I think that I'm going to return this one and get the equivalent logitech mx400 although that doesn't seem perfect either.What's the deal with all these new mouses, they can't even do the simple stuff well anymore."
3,"Comfortable, but sloppy construction","Had this mouse model for over 10 years and the pads finally started wearing out (didn't slide well). Bought the same mouse again, but the new one was put together very poorly. The right mouse button only depressed if your finger tip was in the middle of the button, and the side buttons had more slop than the older one.Since I love the ergonomic comfort of the mouse, I ended up keeping it. But I had to take the mouse apart and add some shims to right mouse button to raise it up a bit. I also snugged up the side buttons by layering some electrical tape to press on the back of the side button assembly when the mouse is closed up.Works great now, but I am very disappointed in the ""Made in China"" quality they shipped out. I suspect this is sloppy manufacturing, not just a defect in my particular mouse. (That is why I chose to fix the mouse rather than bother getting another replacement.)"
3,"A great mouse, until it's not.","I've been using the intellimouse 3 for a few years now, and my experience with it was great initially. Then one day, it started doing something extremely irritating, it started double clicking on single presses, which you can actually set a mouse to do on icons in the control panel, but I had none of those settings active, it just started doing it. I tried cleaning every part of it until I could see my reflection on it, which did nothing.So I bought another one.Fine for a few months, then BAM, same problem. I've read a lot of forum posts about people having a similar problem. I think there are just reliability issues with some of them.Other than that little personal nuisance though, it's a good mouse, comfortable to use, the extra buttons are helpful for games and other things, I'd recommend it, but it's longevity between users seems extremely variable, which can be said for any consumer product, but there you go."
5,Mesmorizing,"This CD is a must for anyone who loves great guitar work and memorable melodies. I'm not generally a fan of live albums, but the atmosphere here adds to the performance. Every cut is worthwhile and some (Keith Don't Go) are exceptional."
3,Good not great,"I think poeple on this list are a little too eager to throw out a five star rating, granted they are all hardcore Lofgren fans so they are a little biased...A good album, a 3.5, not a 5...the lyrics are a little too sappy in most of the songs, which explains why he is relegated to sideman status, his lyrics aren't effective enough...but on the upside, and what makes this album worth purchasing, is the incredible musicianship. There are about 8 beautiful songs on this disc, notably ""Blackbooks"", ""Some Must Dream"" and ""Little On Up""...some of the most amazing acoustic solos I have ever heard...the production is remarkably crisp and at times the music is breathtaking...but five stars is classic and this effort is a little too spotty to be put up there with albums of the stature of Sticky Fingers and the like...still worth buying...but don't be taken in by the unchecked enthusiasm of this crowd, if you do you will be sadly disappointed..."
3,Extremely weak lyrics and vocals,"The musicianship is outstanding. The recording quality demonstrates how excellent a CD can sound. That says a lot with over-produced, highly-compressed CDs being the current norm. Unfortunately the quality of the album ends there. Nils Lofgren does not have a good voice and he should definitely leave the high notes alone. But the worst part of the album is the inane and banal lyrics. It would be kind to call the writing sophomoric since the lyrics are more kindergarten quality and repetitious. It appears that since the songwriter had little to say they felt compelled to say it multiple times.A five star album should have no flaws and this album unfortunately has two very critical flaws that are difficult to ignore---voice and lyrics. Leo Kotke released a CD called ""One Guitar, No Vocals"". Hopefully Nils Lofgren will do the same someday."
5,Nils - Acoustic!,"Amazing acoustic guitar work. Nils is much more than a master of the guitar. The more I listen to this CD, the more I appreciate the artist that he is. Whether you are a fan of Nils Lofgren, a fan of guitar -- especially acoustic -- this is a great album to have in your cache."
5,Best Ever,Hands down this is the best LCD screen is the best I have ever seen. It is totally high definition and is great for dvd's and video games.It has a very vivid and bright picture it looks realy slick and is easy to hang on a wall.
5,It works and the cord is plenty long.,"Before installing this device I had between 1.5 and 4 volts in my tank. After adding it I have none. I know that this is not a ""fix"" for the problem of leaking voltage, but now I can take my time to locate the offending device. I can also sleep easy knowing that future voltage leaks will be stopped by this unit. The cord on this is 10' (TEN FEET) long. I read another review that said 10"" (TEN INCHES) I can confirm that this is not the case as it is in my HOB refugium and the cord easily reaches the floor to plug in on a 90 gallon aquarium with a stand, so it is dropping a good 5 - 5.5 feet with plenty of slack."
1,Too short for anything practical.,"This is a total rip off and amazon has the nerve to charge me for return shipping. The cord must be plugged into a wall outlet, however the cord is 10"" long and it just isn't practical to think my sump is 10"" from an outlet. The package was either cracked from age or because no one wants them and people just send them back. Don't waste time or money on this product. I'm also a prime member that is having to pay for return shipping because they decided this isn't their fault. It's a total rip off. Will definitely reconsider renewing my prime membership this year."
4,Time for alittle something different,"Sometimes it can be hard to put into words your feelings towadrs an album, and this is no exception. The sounds conjured up by Sawhney make you wonder whether musician is the right word for him. Perhaps majician would be more appropriate. All I can say is that if you haven't bought this album yet, then there is a musical genre missing from your collection. That genre is known simplay as Nitin Sawhney..."
4,Compelling but Short,"The first half of this novel was absolutely amazing - as if I was magically transported to another entertaining world filled with great waves, crazy adventures, and sexy encounters with ""professionals"" and other mind-bending characters. Somehow, I think the Editor showed up on Nicholas' door right when the second half got underway because the pace hurried, the details were lost from the first half of the book, and the message and adventure got muddy.I definitely recommend the book - especially if you surf, you'll get charged by it - because of the great character portrayals, the comical situations, and the vivid imagery. Hopefully, though, on the sophomore effort from NC, the Editor will leave him alone for a few extra days..."
4,Overall....pretty good,"This book gives good ideas for toys to make at home and gives some good description of children's play at different stages. The main problem I have is that I have never carved wood and there are no directions on how to actually carve. I would like to make some of the wooden toys, but I will need to do more research beyond this book to actually be able to carve the wooden toys. So, I guess I'm saying, if you have a base knowledge in sewing and carving, this book is very good....if not, you will need to do some other research in addition to this book."
4,Terrific for open-ended play ideas,"While some of the ideas are raw even for my taste (using baskets of cleaned, dried, stone fruit pits for money when playing store, for instance etc.), I have made & implemented a number of others, particularly in the doll-making areas, & designing a play space.Bear in mind that the book lends itself to Waldorf-style play, which encourages open-ended play things & spaces that foster imagination, as well as incorporating nature into as many aspects of children's play as possible. So the toy making entails a lot of wood carving of ambiguous, amorphous figures, dolls and ""blocks.""It also has instructions for making the semi-popular cloth Waldorf doll, which is a nice element of the book."
3,A Redhead's Review,"This is the book that will turn your sex life around. With it's tips on how to please both a man and a woman, I think may couples would find this book very easy to read together and fun too."
3,Richard Simmons foodmover journal,Good home resource -- too large to carry with you during the day but has 30 days worth of menues and grocery lists to correspond with meals. A good additional aid for use with the deal a meal plan.
2,"Look for the ""fine print""","I thought this product was the Richard Simmons ""Deal a Meal"" program from the 80's. It wasn't. The item was ONLY the binder. It DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FOODMOVER! (about $20) I paid more for shipping than the item itself."
2,There's a Major Problem w/ the Journal,"In the journal,Simmons refers to ""cards"" and the ""food mover."" The ""cards"" and the ""food mover"" do not come with the journal, which is the problem. The ""cards"" and the ""food mover,"" apparently are out of print, as one cannot find them anywhere on the net. I'm familiar w/ how the ""cards"" and ""food mover' work, as I used to own the Simmons ""Deal A Meal"" card plan. I gave the plan away as someone needed it more than me. I thought I would be able to purchase another set; however, like the ""cards"" and ""food mover,' the ""Deal A Meal"" is no longer available. I lost weight using the ""Deal a Meal"" plan and believe I'd lose weight w/ the ""cards"" and ""food mover,"" if I had them. Without the ""cards"" and ""food mover,"" the journal is out dated in my opinion, and pretty much useless. Until the two become available again,the suitable place for the journal would be on the dollar table at Barnes and Nobles."
5,slimaway everyday food mover journal,i thought it was a journal too put my food mover in. it was 3x that and that much more. it was a real deal. i would buy it again if i had too. very very happy with it!!!
3,"Great for history and formulas, NOT for beginners...","I bought this book under the assumption and recommendation that it would teach me how to begin developing my own film... Unfortunately, this is NOT the book for that! This book has great historical value in describing the different formulas, their strengths and weaknesses, and contains charts that are probably valuable to those who ALREADY process their own film. This book is NOT for beginners looking into how one goes about processing their own film!"
5,A must!,"This is a book from someone that really knows what he is talking about. Well structured, complete with accurate details, this book should be in every photographer's bookshelf."
2,Disjointed. No pervasive structure.,"This book essentially lists the major (classes of) enzymes, hormones & other important molecules that constitute the human body and provides a short description of each. For a popular science work, it can seem pretty dry. There's no engaging organization to the content. Think of it as a condensed encyclopedia of some of the major molecular systems. There are some interesting tidbits, but I wouldn't recommend this work."
4,David Porter - Victim of the Joke?,"This is a good album, not to the level of ""Gritty Groovy and Gettin' It"" or ""Into A Real Thing"", but if you are a fan of D.P. you need to have this in your collection. I have these two on wax and would love to have them reissued and add to my cd collection.There are a couple or real gems here that I love to listen to."
2,Small budget and poor rendition of India,"I saw the movie on DVD last night. While amusing to some extent, it seemed to me to be rather poorly done. While a movie that has movie making as part of the plot, the scenes that could have been filmed on location to add realism were done on obvious sets, such as waiting in line at an airlines ticket counter.In no way does it hint at the enormous complexity of life in Bombay/Mumbai or the differences between various religious groups or castes, which would have come into play in any real life romance (even based on the producer's real romance with the leading actress).Overall a disappointment."
2,Disappointing,"I've seen my share of both Bollywood movies and Bollywood-inspired movies, and the lead actress was not convincing in the role of a Bollywood star. The movie could have been slightly better if a more suitable actress was cast. The story was executed so poorly that I couldn't finish the movie."
5,Best verson of the story,"This is expanded from a longish short story, and of course was made into that AWFUL movie, but it is a very fun read and really has that early Zelazny sense of a very strange world."
3,More like three and a half stars.,"This is weaker Zelazny, which makes it better than most novels. If you are looking for a book that has action with out sacrificing literary skill this book is for you."
2,unimaginative post-apocalyptic smoking advertisement,"This would have been a decent book if the reading level hadn't have been for 4th graders or if the color scheme used by Zelazny was suitable for 5 year old's. Even the general plot is fairly juvenile, obviously targeted towards teen-aged males. And what better way to sell cigarettes to teenagers than to advertise smoking in a sci-fi novel targeted towards teenaged boys? This book must have been paid for by the tobacco industry, as there is a sheer ridiculous amount of chain smoking involved (nearly on every page).Zelazny didn't put much thought into the post-apocalyptic plot, besides the lame midwestern monsters. There seems to be ample cigarettes in an America in economic collapse, as is there plenty of coffee and other items difficult to obtain (eggs, meat, etc). In my opinion, this book was just one big tobacco advertisement with little or no imagination."
5,The most inovative CD Ive heard in...,"This is the most innovative CD I've heard in years. The album as a whole has many cutting-edge tracks. My favorite cuts are Melo Deez, Red Sun, and Hectic Daze in a Beautiful World. The thing thats best about this album is its versatility and lyrics. I recommend this to anybody looking for that buried tresure in music. Bangin foreal!!"
2,A steep slide downhill after the first track,"What a disappointment! After the iconic, slippery-smooth title song, most of the rest of the CD is just middle-of-the-road elevator music. If you're looking for a great blaxploitation soundtrack, get the 25th anniversary edition of Curtis Mayfield's Superfly, or Across 110th Street, with Bobby Womack's brilliant vocal."
5,Shaft :A Bad Mother Shut Your Mouth!,"Shaft: Music From The Soundtrack (1971 Film)The CD took me back to 1971 ,Daytona Beach ,BCC college @ the time.Went downtown to see the movie .The music still invokes the excitement and feelings of the time.Great CD,Arrived on time,& packaged well."
3,"Not bad, in this post-""Alias"" era","I've become strangely attracted to this indie actioner out of Canada. A ""think-I-can"" combination of TV's ""Alias"" and John Woo gun-opera.Johanna Black is striking as hit woman Hannah, and Billy Dee Williams just has fun as the slimey US Senator.Sure, BDW's toadies need some acting lessons, but they're easy to ignore as director Bascombe continuously slows down Hannah's gun-toting posing for a cool effect."
4,great indie action film,"Fun, action packed little independant film. Johanna is gorgeous and Billy dee is still as charming as ever."
4,"Great book, especially for a young soldier","I first read this book around 1985, when LTC Scott was the BC of the Airborne Training Battalion at FT Benning. I was going through the Airborne course at the time, and the novel really made an impression on me. I have no idea what happened to LTC Scott after June of 1985 or so, but he really helped me understand what being a soldier was all about. It's a great book, by someone who has really been in small unit combat...so grab it and read!"
4,My first book after High School,"This is a great book taking you out of this world and into the jungles of Vietnam. You make great friends and loose them but in the end you look at the world and life in a whole new way. Breathtaking from start to finish.After High School, I joined the U.S. Army and Attended Jump School. LTC Scott was my commander and I bought the book at the Post Exchange, December 1985. I loved it and have the autographed copy still today."
3,not a bad book,"I found this to be a good read. Scott's technical knowledge is on point and his experience shows through in his writing. I found the romance in the book a little trite, but passable. Its a good book for those unfamilliar with army jargon and technical terms--they are all explained."
5,"Gripping, couldn't put it down!",Gripping accurate account of Vietnam action. Scott creates fascinating characters that totally engulf your mind and soul!
4,It was a good story,"I've heard this book isn't very realistic, since I wasn't in the war I don't know better. In fact I wasn't even born yet. None the less I enjoyed the book."
5,All the emotions of Viet Nam in a book.,As a Viet Nam veteran this is the first book on Nam that I have ever finished and I am ordering three more of his books today. I lost track of the number of times I cried when I read this book and that was only one of the many emotions I felt. If you like action or want a realistic idea of what Nam was like you will love this book.
1,ceiling and wall bracket for pls laser,"I order 3 and I receive 3 diferent no one work with pls5, the boxes have the same code number but item were diferent from each other,I have 3 pls5 for my crew so this was a bad invesment. they should say that work for all but pls5."
5,Takes a lickin' and keeps on....,"My two batteries have clearly outperformed my expectations. They've endured extreme southwest heat (100+ degrees), dust and severe abuse for the past three years. My DeWalt driver's battery surrendered after two years of similar treatment. The Ridgids continue to perform although one's charge doesn't last so long now. I'm buying two more to add to my toolbox. My experience with Amazon has been superb. Two other products I ordered in the past were either flawed or not what was ordered. I received replacements within days, one in two days time."
2,Where's the juice?,needs recharging frequently. not getting much work done with this 'new' battery. You need a pair because one is kinda useless.
1,ridgid 12 volt batteries,I thought the shipping price to be excessive as I ordered 4 batteries to which they were placed in one container and shipped.
1,replacement battery,"I bought this replacement battery because the two that came with the original purchase had begun to not hold a charge. The originals lasted about four years. This replacement failed after two uses. Read other reviews about poor quality replacements, and my experience was the same."
3,What we expected,"It was what we expected. It works, but doesn't last as long as the extended life it replaces. Half the price though for 70% of the battery life. On site it hasn't turned out to be a problem since it runs longer than a recharge takes on the other battery."
5,Hours of entertainment,Even adults get into Spongebob. This series is lots of fun and a favorite to take along in the van on long trips.
5,My kids love this!,"Spongebob has become the newest addiction for my kids and this episode is one of their favorites, and mine too! :) We love the Tiki song."
3,kids like it,"My kids really like this show so I decided to buy it. I was frustrated to find out that after you buy it, it takes forever to download each episode. Very time consuming."
4,Great for the kids,"I have sat through many episodes of SpongeBob with my nephew because he is a bit of a fanatic for this show. At first I didn't really think too much about the show but the more I watched Damien enjoying SpongeBob and Patrick's friendship, the more I realized that it's actually a pretty decent show. There have even been times when he's run to his bedroom to start playing and I keep watching to see what happens. Spongebob Squarepants: The Complete Seventh Season is filled with adventure, intrigue and unforgettable episodes. Your kids can enjoy 572 minutes of SpongeBob episodes. This would make a great gift for your little ones this holiday season."
4,Season 7 Spongebob--Better than Season 6,"My family are Spongebob fans, and I've been hooked since ""Jellyfish Jam"". I agree with the other reviewers that the show has gone downhill since the movie. See other reviews for episode list.PROs:9 hours of Spongebob for twenty bucksENTIRE season instead of two purchases of half a season (Studio soaking their fans for cash)MUCH better than Season 6""Earworm"" episode is pretty goodCONs:""My Sister Sam"" episode with Patrick's sister is pretty dumbNot as good as the first 3 SeasonsSeason 7 is a big improvement over 6 (Vikings, really?) but I think this show has seen better days. Overall, I love to turn off my brain after a stressful day at work and watch Plankton try to get the formula or Patrick be an idiot. Recommended."
3,one of the least favorite seasons,"i bought this for my 5, 3, 2 yr olds who love spongebob. i was looking for new dvds since the kids were getting bored with the others. they don't seem to care for this season. it has a lot of different characters and the episodes are just not as funny. they love the more annoying spongebob along with patrick and this was not it."
4,"Acoustic, instrumental gem-","This one's been out for awhile as an import. It has finally been released domestically. This is an all instrumental (except ""Out of the Box"" which includes a ""dramatic reading"" by Michael) all acoustic effort. The playing focuses on melody and atmospere, rather than speed and power. The result is a group a beautifully played and exacuted songs. It is mostly mellow and while at times sounds very much like Al DiMeola (for me not a bad thing) it stays pretty interesting. I would give it 5 stars but that should only be for the greatest CDs of all time. This one is not there, but its very good. However, if you are looking for hard rock stick to the most recent MSG & UFO releases."
1,Oldrocker from N.C.,I was very disappointed.So much that I sent it back the day I recieved it! WAY TOO SLOW
4,Pox Americana,"You think swine flue is bad, think again. Its amazing how much of an impact smallpox had on the Revolution. We came so close to defeat, not by the hands of the British but because of the virus. It showed up at every major event of the war and had a huge impact on the outcome of these events. From the Siege of Boston to Yorktown smallpox was there. It was also only an American disease since in England the virus was endemic (a harmless childhood sickness much like chicken pox). In the colonies it was not endemic so the Patriots, Loyalists, slaves, and natives were very vulnerable, dying en masse.A second epidemic then spread from Mexico City to Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. It eventually made its way to the Pacific Northwest. Explorers described Northwest coast villages as graveyards, with skeletons lying everywhere.A very good book on an important, but relatively unknown, event in American history."
2,Not so great,Really need to be desperate to read this book. Formula plot with super predictable events and outcome. If you buy it you will be sorry.
4,There are sequels!,"Great book. (Four stars is a lot from me.) I see a lot of people looking for a sequel, evidently unaware of the Hawk & Fisher books. Check out ""Swords of Haven"" and ""Guards of Haven"" - the lead characters are obviously Rupert and Julia, even if Mr. Green is being coy about actually saying so. And now there's a soon-to-be published volume ""Beyond the Blue Moon"" where he evidently stops being coy about it - Hawk and Fisher return to the Forest Kingdom. Sounds fun; I can't wait."
2,Not the worst book I've ever read - but close.,"It's because of books like this that people think Fantasy novels are for children and idiots.Limp characterization. Huge plot holes. Purple prose. And dialogue so clunky you wonder if the author ever actually listened to people talk.Oh, and Cliches Cliches Cliches.I'm willing to give it two stars because there were a few mildly interesting plot twists.I might have liked this book if I'd read it when I was 13, but I liked everything when I was 13. Now I know a good book from a bad one, and this, my friends, is a bad one..."
2,Could have used a Good Editing,"I have read read both the Blue Moon's, and Deathstalker as -well as- the Hawk & Fisher Trilogy, and I now regret every one, realizing years later that all of his books are lacking in something.What's that? Human nature. He takes great ideas, seemingly stealing them from other people, puts them down with a lot of flashes, gore, and catch-phrases -- and we the readers are supposed to squeal.Example? When a boy is hit and bruised repeatedly by a girl he's pursuing, he backs off. He doesn't smile and go after her again.This writer knows flash, but he doesn't know people. For better Fantasy, go to a writer who knows how people work, such as LeGuin, or Robert Heinlen, or Elizabeth Kerner. Don't waste time on trash that keeps you excited while reading and later leaves you empty."
5,one word: awesome!,"To be perfectly honest, I'm surprised that Simon R. Green isn't one heck of a lot more popular than he is. His works in general, and Blue Moon Rising in particular, are intensely satisfying works of fiction. No reader will be disappointed with Green's insightful characterization, suspenseful dramas, grand-scale quests, and smooth, flowing writing. A must-read for any fan of fantasy."
5,"Oh, yeah, this is the fantasy book for humorists","If you want to laugh out loud, laugh till you cry, and stay up late, tied to a book, then read this book. Good luck to all readers!!!!! Please do try this!"
5,Absolutely wunderful,"This is one of the most well-written and one of the most satisfying books I have ever read. Have you ever wondered what was really behind all those minstrels tales of vanquishing evil? Exactly how did they do it? Or a more important question, what did they lost along the way? If so, this book is definately for you. It has a refreshing viewpoint, is fast-paced, and has *real* characters. Even Harald has his good qualities and you want to hate him. If you're interested in fantasy or things slightly medievil, I definately urge you to read this book."
2,Very unsatisfying,"I have to say that having just finished this novel I am quite stunned at the level of praise this book has received here. It is a fairly standard story at its heart - the inhabitants of the Forest Kingdom battle (and battle and battle) as they and their land are being engulfed by the Darkwood (your typical light against the dark, good versus evil shtick). The ""light against the dark"" theme is used quite regularly in the fantasy genre and is okay in the hands of a good story-teller who can put a twist of originality on the tale, but I don't think Simon Green achieves that here at all. In fact this story is just overstuffed with an unrelenting and forced melodrama. Also, for all of its gory demon-slaughtering the author chooses an otherwise incongruously light-hearted approach to the story. The dialogue is sappy and syrupy to the point of annoyance. I find it hard to believe that most sci-fantasy veterans would find it very rewarding."
5,Above and Beyond Excellence,"I may be young but I know a good book when I read one. The story grabs you with ease and wraps you up with suspension and anticipation. The villians aren't easily defeated and require the characters to think for once. You even wonder how the story is going to finish. From fighting demons to rescuing a dragon from a princess, this book has the old medevil stories entertwined with a new twist of humor and fun."
3,"A page turning, mind thrilling, heart warming adventure","I found this book in a used book store and bought it the second I read the excerpt on the front page. I have read over and over, never loosing interest. The humor, love, politics, emotions, and real charachters give Blue Moon Rising the feeling that even when you put it down, Rupert, Julia, Dragon, & Breeze are going to come around the corner at any moment and welcome you into thier world of adventure and intrigue. Simon, WHERES THE SEQUEL?????????? I want more = )"
1,Misleading title and dissapointing book,"From the title I assumed this would deal with boat design rather than just being a compilation of photos. While they are pretty neat, even a little pertinent text would have been great. I admit this may have just been a misunderstanding on my part, but I figure I can spare the rest some greif. If you want a book with any substance, this isn't it.Steve"
2,"The story is not good, but the pictures are.","This book is weird. It tries to be a poem in some places, and in other places it doesn't. It's a book that teaches counting, so it's not really about a child afraid of anything. The mom walks around the farm with her son and counts the animals - the end.If you buy it, buy it for the pictures. They are beautifully done and so detailed. I just wish the story had revolved more around the little boy and less around counting random animals."
1,Not Keystone! Not RJ-11!,"This insert is too wide to fit into a Keystone plate; it is more properly called a QuickPort insert. Also, the so-called ""RJ-11/RJ-12"" connector has 8 wires instead of 4 or 6. It looks more like an RJ-45 connector. And, guess what, it does not fit a telephone modular jack (RJ-11).As you might guess, it got returned."
2,Not worth the price for the effort.,"When it works, it works well. What one has to be careful of is that it needs an nVidia graphics card to start with, I think GeForce but it might take others too. To get stereoscopic vision one must use old drivers from a few years ago. nVidia has not and will not update these due to a contract with another company. Then the resolution must be changed to 800x600 and lastly find a game that actually works with it. There are some listed on their site.It's just too expensive for what it delivers which is nothing more than the hardware really. Everything else is up to the consumer and the consumer must be ready to make a few changes to the computer.It was good when I bought it several years ago but today, I'd not do it. I'm looking for modern alternatives now."
1,Pasific Laser Systems and Amazon just cost me money!,"I received my brand new PLS360E on a Thursday for a ceiling job to begin on Friday. After my crew and I finished loading in to the job, we set about to work by first putting fresh batteries in our new laser. Imagine our disappointment when we turned the thing on and the device did nothing but light up it's little green indicator. After calling PLS tech. support, I was told it must have a disconnected wire inside and would have to be returned for service. This on a Friday afternoon at a jobsite at least 30 miles to the nearest rental outlet where I might pay to rent a ""working"" laser. Needless to say, I sent the crew home and broke the news to the homeowner that we would not be starting their job until next week. Maybe PLS will have a working laser to me soon after we finish with the rental one."
5,Nice Toy,"I purchased this item for my kids, because every time we went by him, the would start Awwin. He comes with a bomb/grinade, a gun, and a headpiece (he also comes with a stand) He stands on his own and has several points of articulation. Great toy!"
5,"Warm, beautiful Christmas story","My mother and I each have a copy of this wonderful book and have read it every Christmas for many years. The Substitue Guest brings alive warm images of Christmas, contains a great story and celebrates Christmas' true meaning."
1,Listen to your dishwasher run instead,"I've heard other trax by Timo on compilation mixes that I really liked. When I found this used I picked it up and then played it with great anticipation.It has to be the most boring and monotonous trance CD I've ever listened to. Just the same thing over and over. Why bother with 2 CDs? This all could have been boiled down to just one single track.Please, no maas!"
3,Just Okay,"Well......the real good songs in CD 1 is ""love in traffic"" and """"innoncente"" which is awsome and the last track.....and the others are just okay and some are really boring.Same thing with the second CD.......the 2nd track is kinda good and other tracks like ""island"" and ""sputnik"" but i did'nt really enjoy it!!My point is that there are not real good tracks in the CD except fr a few of them but the ones which are good are real good like the ones mentioned above in CD 1"
5,which one,"I really wanna buy the Andruw jones McFarlane figure, i wanna buy the 6' hitting in the white jersey but this page has a big 12' one in the red jersey , if i knew which one i was gettin i would buy it . (if it was smaller one). i really dont know another way of contacting the person selling this i dont use Amazon.com that often so please if someone selling this item lemme know which one this is ...................Thanks"
2,Omelet pan,When I used this pan I was very disappointed in the way the eggs cooked. It browned the eggs before the inside was done. Would not recommend this item.
1,What a piece of junk,"As others have said, the metal on this pan is so super thin, that it warped on the first try.The metal started to give off a noxious odor, like the non-stick element was separating from the metal. My omelette came out tasting and smelling like chemicals, and this thing went right in the trash.This company ought to be ashamed of themselves for producing such a piece of garbage."
2,omelet pan,Too light weight. Becomes rough inside after a couple of uses even though well buttered before any eggs put in. Want a better pan next. You get what you pay for. Will look for a better pan soon.
1,I threw my money away!,This is the worst pan I have ever purchased. I have tried cooking eggs in this pan twice and each time it was a disaster! The eggs stick to the bottom of the pan even though I sprayed it with cooking spray and added butter. I feel like I just gave this company $12.00 of my money. I threw the pan away because it was not worth the frustration and reminder of what a poor purchase I made!
5,Progressive Omelet Pan,Omelet pan is satisfactory and as advertised. It is plenty large for more than one serving.
1,Progressive Omelet Pan Performance,"On the first use of The Progressive Int. Omelet Pan the non-stick surface failed, causing the omelet to stick and burn and rendering the pan useless for any future use. I would strongly recommend against the purchase of this omelet pan."
3,Somewhat dissappointed,I received my omelet pan and used it the next morning. The pan worked fine and I have enjoyed it. I am however dissappointed in the quality of the pan. I thought it would be made of more substantial materials. The pan looks and feels like a cheap camp pan from a discount or dollar store.
1,Don't do it!!!!,"I found it to be Flumsy, very unpredictable. I regret this purchase. Omelet's burn easily. I am so disappointed. Turn out to be a big waste of money."
1,omlette pan,its cheaply made an the black pain i will call it chipped off with in a week of experimenting with it. dont waist your money
3,Not bad - the price is right on,"We have like this and had no problems so far. My one complaint is the screw for the handle was too small, so we had to find another one that worked. Other than that, for an $11 pan, the quality is what I expected."
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK,"This pan is a total wste of money. I used it once and it's ready for the garbage can. It dosen't even fit properly on the largest of my electriv burners. Don't waste your money, this thing is really cheap quality."
1,Absolute Junk,"I received this pan as a Christmas gift and can't believe what a piece of junk it is. Please don't waste your money or insult anyone with this garbage. Cheaply made, plastic and paper thin teflon coated metal. I can't believe people would even consider buying this garbage. If you want quality cookware, purchase Anolon, Calphalon, All-Clad, etcetra."
1,Please save your money!,"Oh my gosh...when you get the pan it comes disassembled, so you have to screw the handle together. Well, I used it once and the handle came right off while cooking. Now, the screw is stripped and it can't be put back! I used it only once! Well that was the most expensive omelet I ever had. Aside from the handle, overall it is a very cheap pan and it does not look like it will last very long. I'm going to return this item.Please save your money!"
1,The worst piece of junk ever!,"I bought this from my local BBB store thinking that I can finally enjoy my omelets without extra work. Boy was I wrong!First of all, this thing comes disassembled with absolutely no directions of how to put it together.Second, the material it is made from is just pure garbage. I put it on med high stove, closed it for a few minutes so that it will be hot enough, and when I was ready to pour eggs in there, the smoke started to come from the inside. The interior coating was burned and it just peeled off!I'm glad that this actually happened BEFORE I made anything in it, because something that comes off that easily is sure to be in your food.Save your money and buy something else."
1,Poorly designed pan,"First of all, the pan came with a broken handle. When the shipper wouldn't respond I had to contact the manufacturer for a replacement handle which I promptly received. This pan is supposed to have a nonstick surface which it does not and there were no instructions included which would have been nice to have as well as recipes. It is a useless product."
4,TRACK LISTING,1. You're Makin' Me High (Album Version) 4:292. You're Makin' Me High (Classic Mix) 9:433. You're Makin' Me High (Dance Hall Mix) 4:524. You're Makin' Me High (Groove Remix) 4:335. Let It Flow - 4:22
4,High Enough,"Someitmes, there is a song so seductive, it takes your breath away. For Toni Braxton, she absolutely took that message to storm and view. There is a song definitely can bring a message that is so elegant. The song, You're Makin' Me High, the first track from Secrets, Toni Braxton's follow-up to her amazing self-titled debut record, is just a song that absolutely grabs your heart and mind from the soul up. Still, the song does continue to hold up nicely, well after it was released in 1996. Still, the song is great, but also fits nicely, well with so many artists overzealously overexposing their sexual preludes and thensome. This is just one of those songs worth seducing with."
1,not very good,"i am a big nin fan but these songs dont do trent justice at all and i feel he would frown upon this so called ""tribute"".more like a disgrace to nin. DONT BUY!! THE SONGS ARE TERRIBLE!"
5,A classic british television drama whatmore can we ask for?,"I think that this remake of Docotr Zhivargo is i have got to say, better than the original. Of corse the first was a classic with julie and omar but the dialouge was poor at times and showed a brief outline of relationships that the book went through at great length. The remake has dialogue that so much fits the book and makes it easier not to cringe at parts. The actors are amazing, Hans Matherson brings Yury to another dimension and shows him not only as a handsome man but also a man who liek any other seduces woman, kiera at the time was just a mear 16 years of age when she filmed this film, she has portrayed Lara to the best of her ability as a young actress starting out, i give her full marks, a very endeering prefermance that kept me in tears the whole length of the film and the finally better than the original...amazing!"
2,"A good try, but...","Having seen and appreciated the 1965 classic version of this movie, I was curious to compare and contrast the classic with the new. I found the young cast to be exceptionally strong and skilled, especially Sam Neill in his portrayal of ""Kamarovsky""; however, I was very disappointed with important changes: the father's death and funeral scenes completely lacked the impact of the original movie, where the mother's burial view from her coffin, beautifully yet eerily remote from the winter storm above, was riveting; likewise the spring Varykino was not the lovely ice palace of the original film. Overall, a good try, but nothing like the beauty and eloquence of the 1965 version."
5,Beautiful.,"I never thought they could re-make one of the most wonderful love stories of all time and have it be credible, but it was done--I was blown away. I intended just to watch the first hour on TV but ended up staying for all four! Incredibly moving, and i am so glad its on DVD."
5,my review about the mini series dr. zhivago it rocks.,"i really liked watching this flim it totall y touched my heart. and the actors and actresses where really good in this mini series. hans matheson and all the actors gave good performances in this movie.fan , rosiec."
4,Doctor Zhivago,"I have mixed feelings about this edition of Dr. Zhivago. I still am dedicated to the original movie with Omar Sharif as Yuri and Julie Christie as Lara. Ofcourse, it could be my age of 57 years! The new production appeals to the younger crowd. My son, age 30, likes the current production better than the original production. I do think there's a possibility that it is a closer rendition to the book. I am listening to to the book on CD right now for comparision. I do think the new production is well done. Hans Matheson playing Yuri is excellent. Still I favor Sharif. In fact he won the Golden Globe Best Actor for his title role. I also think the first production had a little more class. I like Christie above Keira Knightley. The first production left more to your imagination in the love scenes."
2,So Disappointing,"The directing/editing began bothering me because it began feeling too staged, like short perfectly staged scenes as if a series of snapshots rather than a real flow and continuity. Everything was so clean/perfect makeup. Worse, I felt no deep passion between them like there was in the original film. It was hard to believe there was even love between them. For example, nothing in the hospital scenes gave me any sense of any real emotion/love growing between them. A few scenes of them together and that whole part of the story was over. So much lost in these seemingly quick takes..So disappointing.."
3,Great writing/scenery but questionable acting,"While I never even bought into the original ""love story"", if you did happen to like the original, you will probably like this one and enjoy assessing the differences. Bottom line is I think I did actually like the writing in this better. The scenery is splendid. One does have a better appreciation for the characters. Funny though - Zhivago sounds between American and British, Lara sounds completely British, and Tanya is the ONLY one who speaks English with the appropriate Russian/Eastern European accent. The actress who portrayed Tanya is wonderful and believable - the rest completely Hollywood. This movie would be so much better without the horrid casting of Keira Knightly."
3,More faithful but lacking resonance.,"The story is well known form the passionate film adaptation in the 1960's, starring Omar Shariff and Julie Christie.That film was very of it's time, not entirely faithful to the novel but immensely passionate and engaging.This mini series is slavish to the novel and the historical period, the budget is wisely used to carefully and faithfully set the scenes and give a good impression of the period.Somehow it just doesn't quite work, there is a lack of the sense of passion and longing; the crux of the story really!For me the problem is Knightley, yes she is very pretty but her screen persona is wet and inaffective, I didn't care what happened to her other than to hope she would go away; a far cry from the feelings Christie inspired! Sadly dissapointing."
3,Praising supporting characters,"LA CELESTINA is a good, not great movie, from a great storyline. It involves a witch, a failing romance, a virtuous young woman & a horny knight. The knight has two servants that appear to have different opinions about the witch but turn out to be more alike than intended.The acting is great except for Penelope (female lead) Cruz who both doesn't have enough of a role nor does she do enough. It comes with either English or Spanish language track & English subtitles. The musical soundtrack is classical & I enjoyed it a lot.The witch & her influence on the town are as marvelously done as the music. Throughout the movie it is the servants & witch that power the story & not the lead actors. I can't rate it 3 stars but I can't rate it 4 either. The love story is kind of weakly done in my opinion. I'll give it 3.5 Amazon Stars."
3,Gracias Miguel,Soy profesor en un colegio en NJ y mi clase de español IV está leyendo una versión corta de esta novela. Quería ponerles la versión filmada pero me parece que no vale la pena.
2,Junk,"Provides an ok picture, but it should not be used with laptops.A known bug with this is that the antennas of many laptops are in the top of the display, right where this device clips on.Other devices like logitech - provide some shielding so that the wifi antenna doesn't interfere with the audio from the microphone.This microsoft device, however, picks up a tremendous amount of static because of interference from the laptop antenna.Microsoft offered a full refund immediately and stated that this is a known issue."
4,"Great for a webcam, Cheap, but horrible drivers","So I have used this Camera on vista and Win7, but both I had some major driver issues. It has GREAT picture quality, the frame rate is average, and sound rocks! Unfortunately, it looses a star because in order to use it I must unplug all my jump drives!! I can use the camera when transferring files, it sucks! But other then this, it is great."
3,Disappointing range of focus,"I bought this webcam thinking, like everyone else, that it'd be reliable.It's quite reliable, but I thought that the range of focus was disappointing.When you get close to the webcam, it gets blurry pretty quickly. To be honest, it's a wide problem. I found that to be true with Logitech products as well, which is why I had attempted a switch. The only webcam that has made me happy with macro is the IPEVO PoV, and that's because it's got a manual focus.Why good focus is important: well, I chat a lot. But also, I sell some jewelry on eBay. My little beads aren't diamonds, so I have to be able to show a little tutorial on my bracelets with a webcam that'll get close enough as I'm explaining why I like my bracelets.So verdict: ok for chatting, not too sturdy in my backpack, and focus range is disappointing, especially if you're considering showing objects up close."
5,awesome product.,"I really enjoyed this product and the fact that its simple to use!! It clips nicely onto my laptop or I can take it off, it comes with a little protective case, and the lens slides in to keep it unexposed when you're not using. I really like it and all its features as well."
3,"Nice Picture Quality, but MANY Compatibility Issues","I was pretty disappointed by this webcam. It has relatively good picture quality & it's small & compact, but I spent my whole afternoon trying to install it. First of all, the CD that it came with didn't work for Vista, so I had to find drivers on the Microsoft site. Second, I don't really use MSN, so I had a huge deal of trouble using it with other non-Microsoft programs. I have to leave the camera on with whatever program I'm using; if I exit the application, I have to restart my computer again. I had a simpler Logitech camera before and it did not have this many problems. Unless you're a big fan of Microsoft video applications, I'd go with a different, more versatile webcam from a different company."
3,VIDEO NOT 2.0MP,"Just bought and installed this product, poped the installation CD in and says my product has compatability issues with windows 7.....ok.....downloaded updated software...Turned on the software, here were myresolution options for video320 x 120640 x 480800 x 600Resolution options for pictures2mp8mpThe main reason I bought this over the nx-3000 model was because it was advertised as a 2.0 mp for video. WRONG..it is NOT 2.0 MP for Video! Would have rather purchased the nx 3000 and save $10.Besides the cool case it comes with and attaches to the laptop its not a bad product. But like I said could have gone with the nx-3000...video quality I really saw no difference between this and the generic $8 cam I bought. Frustrates me when you dont get what you expect..."
2,"Not what I expected, should have listened to people's reviews.","This seems like a great idea with an easy to use camera and all that jazz, however... This isn't great. The installation was simple, just pop a disc into the cd player and follow the directions. After you plug the USB cord in it seems so wonderfully easy, until you have to try and fit it onto your lid. My computer is an Alienware and I never really took notice to the curved and deep lid until this Lifecam wouldn't stay on. I finally finangled the dang thing so it would stay, but unless you actually have a squared off, 90 degree angle flat lid, it's not going to stay well.The picure is just a problem. 20% of the time it worked, the rest was colorful snow. Plus the microphone doesn't work unless you are within a foot of it so I would humbly suggest you get a different product. But I must say, having a sliding camera lens to shut it off and turn it on is awesome... the only awesome thing about it."
4,Seems pretty good to me,It's pretty much as it describes. As far as compatibility problems go. I have Windows 7 and it just told me to go online and then started to download the update it needed to do the installation so no real problems there. Granted I've only used it for about a day but the video quality of it seems fine about what I had expected. The only thing about it is with the sound it has some weird humming or pulse kinda sound. I'm going to see if I can't do anything about that maybe the other person doesn't hear it? I'm not sure because all I've done was video record myself. So far though it seems what I paid for.
4,Good enough,"I feel this product is definitely worth it for the price. Only good for laptops though. Picture quality is alright, definitely not as good as they advertise. I found some of the software to not function completely but the camera itself serves its purpose. If you want something for the long term and will use this often, go buy a more expensive camera."
3,"Great Video, not so good audio","The video quality is great, camera mounts perfectly, its quick and simple to setup, although with vista you need to download the new driver from microsoft which is painless. The audio has a lot of static interference. I would recommend this camera with a seperate headset or microphone."
4,Overall Good Buy,"This Cam works great and the small size is very convenient, however the attachment piece does not open large enough to fit on larger monitors. Made for laptop monitors only! Suggest an attachment be offered with the device for use on any monitor width or to sit on top. Attaching to a larger monitor with"" Two Face Tape"" does not cut it!"
4,Great Quality for the price,Picture quality is great for a webcam. I've used it quite successfully in teleconferencing. Note that it's not quite working completely in Vista yet.
3,MS Lifecam nx-6000,"Not having used another webcam, I can offer no comparision. I used the NX-6000 with Yahoo Messenger. The picture was jerky with voice and picture not matching very well. The important thing for me was that it did bring my family members closer to me than voice alone. Many of my family members are on the other side of the country. The NX-6000 was designed for a laptop. If you have a desktop, get another model from Microsoft or Logitech."
2,Don't buy it if you want to use it on a notebook,This won't even fit a Think Pad X61 notebook! I use it on a desktop PC (I had to put velcro on it. What was Microsoft thinking when they designed this? I didn't install the software since I don't use Live. I just plugged it in and it works fine.
2,Nx-6000 WebCam from Microsoft*,I found some minor issues with this WebCam:(1) I cound not mount it to the top screen cover of my laptop (an IBM T series) (2) The video quality is poor using an older USB 1.1 port. Conclusion: Microsoft expects you to use a 2.0 port with this WebCam. No biggie!
1,"Hours to install, hours more to repair damage","The camera worked OK, but installation on my non-Vista one-month-old Dell Inspiron 9400 was very difficult. The software installation failed numerous times. Finally, after about eight attempts, I read on a help website to reinstall Logitech cam drivers as I had previously installed a Logitech webcam. That and a download of the Lifecam v.1.3 software finally did the trick. I used the cam 48 hours before my system started inexplicably crashing with strange error messages. After several hours on the phone with Dell support and allowing them remote access to my computer, they determined the entire Windows O/S had to be reinstalled, and they faulted the cam for all the problems. I cannot recommend strongly enough AGAINST buying this webcam."
1,Bad design / complicated installation,"I needed a webcam pretty much right away so headed down to best possible and got the unit for $100 plus tax. It was probably worth it since I saved myself the shipping for the return.For starters I want to say I am not a Microsoft hater, actually I bought the unit thinking I would get better quality and support. What I found out is that the webcam is pretty useless if you have an IBM Thinkpad since the clip is not adjustable, in fact preventing you from mounting the web cam on your screen display.The install seems complicated, you need to download and install MS Live messenger before proceeding with the actual hardware installation.Based on my findings the NX-6000 is not worth the steep price considering the complex installation and the inability to adjust the clip for a given laptop. However, I am impressed with its posted specifications."
1,Microsoft lijecam nx-6000,"It is a horrible product. I bought and i had a lot of problems just installing it. Finally after installing it, the image resolution was horrible so i had to struggle with the webcam until finally i got a good image. After 2 weeks it just stopped working , i red the manuals, went to the microsoft website and tried everything they tell you to do and i could not fixed it. Off course you can call a technician from microsoft but they will charge you 35 dollars.In summary , this is not a good product. Not for this price. I feel i was robbed"
1,piece of junk,this cam is a piece of junk i have a super thin laptop and the clip is not wide enough
2,not worth the money,"I disagree strongly with the reviews before. My daughter owns a MS Livecam 3000 for much less in price and it beats this one by far. The picture is very smooth yes, BUT the colors are terrible and even manually there is no way to improve it, faces look magenta all over. The two megapixels are for nothing because if you choose anything higher than 800x600 resolution you will get a delay of up to seconds on your screen within the LiveCam program and even with videos captured on your harddisk you can see this effect, so the higher resolution is worth nothing. This is with a brandnew Core2Duo machine 1Gig of mem so it is not the speed of the computer in my view.I would keep the cam if it would be cheaper say in a range of 30 bucks but not for this money."
3,"decent image, not for thinkpad","This camera offers a decent image and a lot of interesting functions. But if you only need video conference online, probably this camera is way too ""good"". $40 one can also offer you same quality. Extra features won't help in online video conference.Another thing is it's not friendly to thinkpad. The hook on the back is a little bit too small. T60 is barely OK, T43 and below model users, forget it."
4,microsoft lifeCam NX600,"This product was easy to install and works fine. The picture quality is good (not great) but for the price, the product preforms well."
4,GOOD!!!,"This is really clear, even though its a old model. I got two other friends to get it because they saw how good it was when I used it with them."
5,Great webcam!,We love the way this fits securely on our HP laptop and the great resolution. Easy install and very portable. Comes with a travel case. We are buying a second one.
5,Great little webcam,"I got this little webcam from my son-in-law and daughter so that we could talk to the grandkids and see them too. I know absolutely nothing about web cameras, software, etc. My son-in-law was able to walk me through the set up and in 10 minutes, we were having a visual conversation. It works great. It does exactly what we need it to do and it is tiny and can mount anywhere you want with the sticky tape - I'm fortunate - I have a USB port on the side of my monitor. The USB cable is short, though, and if your ports are on your hard drive, you'll need an extension cable. Very satisfied with this camera."
1,"Good picture, but doesn't work for websites.","The picture is great, sound is great -- IF YOU WON'T BE USING IT FOR FACEBOOK, MYSPACE, YOUTUBE, ETC ETC.This product would not work on any websites (with a black screen with a multicolored strip of noise on the bottom on the screen), but if I opened it up on the regular screen it would work fine. I called the number they had provided in order to trouble shoot it, but all the guy could tell me is that it should be compatible for other sites and that he does not work for Facebook or Myspace so he doesn't know why this is happening.If you want to use it for webchatting, it works great otherwise I wouldn't really suggest this product. Just stick with a Logitech."
1,Terrible microphone,"Image is good but microphone has a jackhammer noise, rendering it useless. I only installed it after a few months after purchase or else would have returned it immediately."
1,NX-6000 Laptop Webcam,"I have never been able to establish a stable connection with this camera. it works great thru its own program, but is very unstable when using Skype. Must always disconnect and reconnect to the computer to get it to work. Sometimes this does not work either. I am using VISTA which may also be the problem, but I have not been able to find anything confirming this. All troubleshooting information on the Microsoft website leads me to pulling the plug out of the computer and reconnecting it. This is very annoying, and as i said before, doesnt always work. However, when it does work the audio and video are fabulous."
2,Poor image quality,I bough this webcam for my ID badge bussiness and the quality of the images I get is veeery poor.
5,Excellent buy,"This is an amazing webcam... I love it. It has excellent quality of image. No manual adjustments for focusing. The software controls for zoom, tilt, and pan are cool. It is giving excellent quaility in low light also.Make me look good (in the cam ;)) to my freinds and family.The driver software got along with the cam did not work on Vista, but then it was not difficult to get it online.I would defnitly recommend this. It is also good if you are using Business confrencing.It fits on the laptop like a part of it. The clip at the back is adjustable (expands) about 1/2 an inch, but if your minitor is really thin, it may not fit tight. But my guess is that it should be good for 99% of the laptops out there.I would not recommend this for Desktops unless you want to fix (glue) them on top of your monitor."
3,Good Quality Image but short cable,"If you are considering any other usage for the webcam other than on the top of your laptop, this is probably not for you. The attachment on the back is also a fixed width so it does not clip on or adjust to the laptop for a secure connection."
5,Nice webcam...clip too small though,This webcam is the best that I've used. It has a high MP level so the picture is really good. The problem with it is that the clip is pretty small.
4,Great Quality....,"Great quality, this is my second webcam from microsoft and I can't complain much. I just whish the clip worked a little bit better, it bearly fits my laptop."
4,NX-6000 Webcam,"The install was easy and it has been trouble free. Everybody has been complimentary of the video & audio quality.I use it exclusively with Skype and have not installed the Microsoft update. I understand that the update causes problems if you use Skype, so I haven't bothered with it."
2,Microsoft LifeCam NX-6000 Webcam,"This Webcam has great cam hide style that's why I bought that cam and it's Microsoft that's the reason too but I'm very disappointed with this cam because this cam doesn't compatible with SKYPE, FACEBOOK, YAHOO MESSENGER....!This cam is supports Google Plus and Nimbuzz Only....! Camera has great 2MP picture quality but It's not supports all Social Media that's why I'm so Disappointed...!Don't Buy this if you want to run on skype or facebook or yahoo messenger......! This is for Only Google and Nimbuzz."
3,It was okay,"Since the author took the time to collect, record and translate all of these Haitian creole proverbs I give him three stars, but before ordering the book I conducted an Internet search that gave me a good amount (not 999)of Haitian proverbs. Some of those from the Internet are listed in the book. I don't think the proverbs listed in the book were that enlightening, but none the less I will keep it as part of my Haitian library collection."
5,Nice,Excellent price for a piece of hexagon brass bar. I used approximately 14 inches for a shift rod linkage on a custom chopper project. I had enough left over for the next project
3,A NICE BOOK,"This is a nice book, if you have read Little Men, and are familiar with the characters. I found the capter about Dan especially endearing. Nat's chapter is equally touching. One of the chapters about the one who becomes a sailor is exciting and almost melodramatic in essence. In short, I liked this book."
3,It's A Sequel!,"I read through the book, yet found it confusing and hard to understand. Then I realized it was the third book in a series! I am writing this review for a school assignment, so I will tell you what I got out of this book. It is about Jo March, the mother of three boys whom this book portrays. It has good moral values and bits of funny tales. You will find it is full of romance. I don't really understand a whole lot about the characters, but that is because they were probably described in the previous tales. If I were to give you one piece of advise it would be to READ THE OTHER BOOKS FIRST!"
2,It's Ok,"Sure, this book tells the complete ending to Little Women and Little Men, but in most of the book, are boring parts. There's no action, or drama, or anything interesting in it. It just tells about the life at Plumfield, which can get REALLY BORING! If you want to read one of Louisa Alcott's books, I recommend Little Women, that was one of my favorite books that I have ever read. If you read it, watch the movie, it is AWESOME!"
5,good book not as good as the rest,"I loved this book, but I thought that little men and little WOman were better. Perhaps it is the long times span she took writing it. I thought, however, it clever. I was worried that things wouldn't work out in the end, but they did. You really must read this book if you have read the others it is top notch, just not great literature likee the rest."
1,Do not buy this edition,"This edition appears to be from an OCRed text that was not proof-read. Odd spacings, strange characters, missing words. The binding and paper is cheap.Stay away! (It's not even worth one star.)"
3,"Jo's Boys: Not the Best, but Still Good","Well, it certainly can't compare with Little Women or Little Men, but it is still a good read. But it has a lot of morals, even more so than the other 2. There are several slow points. But if you've read Little Men, and want to know what happens to the originlal Little Women, as well as to Demi, Daisy, Nan, Nat and the rest, this is the book you need."
2,"great history lesson, so-so travel book","Running Away to Sea attempts to take the reader on an around the world journey. While I'm sure Douglas Fetherling made the actual trip, he left the reader at home.Mr. Fetherling has done his research on all the places he visits. He knows, and relates, the history and recent political climates of the countries, islands, and areas he passes through on his round the world trip. He spends comparitively little time describing his trip and the people he meets aboard and ashore. When I picked up this book I expected some real escapism. To have my imagination transported to the far away places that I daydream about. Sub-titled, Around the World on a Tramp Steamer, I was ready to relax while I leaned on the starboard rail and watched the world go by. I was ready for adventure and unforgettable characters. Unfortunately I got a history and current events lesson. This is, of course a well written book by a seasoned author. It just wasn't what I expected."
3,Thoroughly Enjoyable,I really enjoyed the film. I did not get bored for a single second in the film.Mithun Chakravarty acted well in the film.This movie is an Indo-BanglaDesh co-production and includes caste and crew from both countries.
2,WHATCHA GONNA DO,"Well, This is pretty standard stuff once again. Will and Lawrence get it on with a drug ring. lots of cars get smashed...they blowup.... girls in thongs... dead bodies.. guns that rip off 6000 bullets without a reload. They catch the bad guy. Some funny stuff... some dull stuff... more cussin than ever and the movie lasts 2 1/2 hours. Thats 2 hours to long. The end"
3,"Good Movie,Just Too Long.",Before you say you hate my review just listen to what I have to say.The movie was good but they could have taken at least twenty minutes off of it and it still would have been good.The movie was too long.But Will Smith and Martin Lawrence reprise their roles as Mike and Marcus the two Miami cops back with their sometimes dumb antics and good jokes.This is a good movie due to the jokes some which are stupid and some which are hilarious.But the movie is about Marcus and Mike trying to bust an ectasy ring when they find out that Marcus's sister and Mike's girlfriend Syd (Gabrielle Union) is undercover in the ring.The chase scenes that are in the movie are awesome and well done and all the while Smith & Lawrence are still cracking jokes.But the drug bustturns out to be much more than just drug transporting and turns out to be murder and everything else.The movie was alright but it begins to drag sometimes in the middle.C- for the movie and B- for the acting.Enjoy!!!
1,Bad Movie,"I really like Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. But this movie was really not worth my time at home watching it. Sure it was about taking down a drug lord. But who gives a care about a stupid swimming pool bursting. And yet we are left to guess whether or not Marcus's daughter made it home safe and sound.I mean sure it did have its moments where it kept me on the edge of my seat, but after a while it just kept dragging on and on. I am comtemplating returning this DVD back to the store where I bought it. I think watching it once is enough for me."
1,"WAY over-the-top. sir, may i have another explosion please!","thank god i got this as an xmas gift from my nephew. i would of been pissed if i spent even a penny on this one. my brother stormed out of the room 30 minutes into the movie on xmas day. well, at least my nephew (his son) liked it! i hung in there for the entire show out of courtesy to my nephew. otherwise, i was right behind my brother. yeah i know...it's an action movie. what did you expect? i guess i am just getting too old for films that have these endless smash, bang, boom, pow, crash scenes. i won't even bother listing any details except to say................save your money."
1,"HORRIBLE MOVIE, AND I LOVED THE FIRST ONE","Bad Boys one was action packed, had a great script and plot (even if unbelievable at times), and was just plain hilarious. Bad boys II does not live up to its predicesor in the least. This movie sucks! Action packed for sure, but the plot is barely present and the script sucks. This movie is all girls, action and swearing. Bad Boys II isnt even funny! I'm truly disapointed in Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. They can do much better than this."
1,Trash,"How can one call this entertainment? Is entertainment watching people have their brains blown out in slow mo or watching people die four times over? If this is considered entertainment then America's culture is in deep trouble. Bad Boy II has an undeniably thin plot in order to justify horrific acts of brutal violence. Bad Boys II is not even a good action film, it is just mindless shooting and explosions. Thank you Michael Bay for making Americans even stupider, your work on Bad Boys II, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Pearl Harbor has contributed much to the American artistic culture LOL. America is truly in a sad state when a film like Bad Boy II grosses over 100 million dollars."
3,Good but not like the first,"This one is over the top and almost funny at the end because it's so unrealistic, compared to the first one which was less unrealistic. But if you like the first, you must see the 2nd. Great cast and the comedic fillers are good. Action packed, gizmo packed and of course Will Smith is tough as a nutshell"
5,action-packed,"I had the privilege, and yes i mean privilege, of watching bad boys II for the first time today. i didnt go to see it in the theater, dismissing it as another sequel that somehow missed the mark. much to my suprise, this movie is better than the first. it is action packed, has a great storyline, and as you would expect from martin lawerence and will smith, it is also hilarious. It also features the best-kept acting secret, jordi molla. he has mainly starred in non-american films, but has recently came into the american market in this movie and with a superb performance in ""blow"" with johnny depp and penelope cruz. bad boys II isnt just another sequel, it is a comedic thrill ride from start to finish that is well worth the price of the DVD. I recommend it to anyone aged 16 up, there is a lot of graphic violence and language, but overall, a great movie."
3,"Impressive Effects, but predictable story","Will Smith and Martin Lawrence still have chemistry and the direction of this movie is better, but this movie has more jokes then a story. the funniest scene in my view is when they check the dead bodies, shows Will Smith and Martin Lawrence and their comedic best, but a little more story and a longer movie could of been done."
2,Their CPAs must have been happy,"Amazingly violent wham-bam, black buddy cop comedy-thriller which is heavy on action and gory shootouts and somewhat light on comedy. But that rather depends on your response to Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.Lawrence is one of the least attractive performers around and his sub-Richard Pryor/Eddie Murphy routine is getting very old. Smith, however, remains reliable and more or less saves the day.The Plot? Oh, it's something to do with designer ecstasy and a major drugs war in downtown Miami in which the two narcotics detectives become more than usually involved when one of them falls for his partner's sister. Their personal relationship stretched to the limit creates danger for them in the face of massive mob action. A Jerry Bruckheimer movie 'Nuff said."
5,The best gun fight and car chasing movie of the year!,"It's quite a long action movie with a very standard story of two hot tempered guys chasing after a cuban ectasy dealer.....That doesnt matter. The gun fights, the car chasing scenes are so fantastic with much improved cinematography than the first episode, certainly attributed to a much higher budget and the pressure on the whole original team including the producer and the director with their current superstar status that could not allow them to disappoint. I am bold enough to say that the amount of ""good stuff"" can actually be spilt into two more average action films. More importantly, some scenes are quite ""new"" or ""creative"", such as dumping cars from a big truck along the highway .....In short, a must rent and watch! If you got a good 5.1 AV system, it's a must buy."
1,"Great Action, Bad Story","It may just be me, but when I watch this movie, it made me hate the cops in the movie and root for the bad guys. These so-called cops violated and broke more laws than the bad guys did! They abuse thier authority so much that it made me want to cause great harm to them. Also, I know that in this politicaly correct world, only white guys are supposed to be ""racist"", but in this movie, Martin Lawrance was the black version of the kkk. His hatred for white folks is very apparent in this movie. I give this one star because of too much racism and abuse of power."
3,"Good action movie, but a little too long.","Everything about Bad boys 2 was action packed, it was fun to see in the theaters when it first came out. The only thing though is it was just a little too long, and the scene where Mike Lowery, and Marcus were caught in the middle of all that gun fire where they caught those drug dealers in the middle of traffic, that scene they could have left out, or it didn't have to go on as long as it did. Another thing I couldn't really understand, is why would they come out with a sequel almost ten years later? As far as the story line was concerened, it was just okay, I just think they went a little too far with all the shooting and blowing up stuff. At the end it seemed more like a movie about a war. Overall it's deffinitely entertaining, and if you're the kind of person who enjoys alot of action then this would be the movie for you."
2,a huge let down,i enjoyed the first bad boys movie but when i saw bad boys 2 the movie was horrible the story plot sucked and for two hours all their was were pointless voilence the reason why i did not give this movie one star is because the highway seen was great sadly that was the only thing
1,Yuck!,"This movie had so much popcorn and reheated cheese, you'll be in danger of choking to death when watching this. Too much action, too many bad jokes, too much over-the-top shocks, and too much Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. After all, who would even pay attention to this movie were it not for the cars being blown up, people being killed in increasingly outlandish ways, dead bodies flying out of a morgue van, and immature sexual references? Martin Lawrence was a pest, Will Smith was average at best, and Michael Bay proves once again that he's a horrible director. There were one or two scenes that were mildly interesting or funny, but overall, you'd have to pay me to sit through this again. Another summer blockbuster/sequel that's not worth a viewing. You can't take anything in here seriously, and you can't really laugh at anything either. As a result, why bother?"
2,Not what I expected,"My husband and I loved the first Bad Boys movie and were looking forward to seeing part two. This movie is definitely an example of how sequals are never quite as good as the original. In this case it was no where near as good. My husband fell asleep halfway through the movie,which is a definite sign that the movie is not that good. The movie did have its funny moments but they were few and far between. The car chases were endless and the story dragged on for almost 2 and a half hours. Unless you just absolutely love any movie that Will Smith is in I wouldn't recommend it."
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE CRAP!!!,This movie is even worse than the original.How could anyone believe that these two comedians are cops?Give me a break.The movie had the same old stereotypical druglord plot to it which is getting very old.The acting was horrible and had some really corny jokes.Will smith stinks as an actor and should stick with being on tv.Way too much mindless rap in the soundtrack.Worst movie of the year.DO NOT BUY THIS DUMB MOVIE!!!
2,Bad Boys 2 has just gone bad!,"I saw Bad Boys 2 over the summer and it was quite a traumatizing expierence. For real, the movie shot at me like a cannon. This sequel to the fun-filled original is loud,long, cramed with endless language and violence and did i mention long? The action sequences do look impressive but there are too many loud car crashes and bloodshed. In one huge scene, the police chase a cartel in the freeway and there's bodies and people dying.The filmmakers are absolute nuts! I'm speaking to u Jerry Buttheimer! Speaking of limbs, the morgue scene with Smith and Laurence picking out the dead's insides is outrageously disgusting.If this is your cup of tea have fun. as for me, im spending my time better in good use"
3,Bad Boys II,"I ordered this for my daughter and when I gave it to her, the movie inside was actually Bad Boys Part I. She did not get part II. So, was a little disappointed in that but she likes Part I too. The movie plays well and is in good condition. So, happy with product other than the fact that it is the wrong movie."
3,"Not as good as the first one, but still entertaining","I'd give this 3.5 stars if I could. Fun movie. Not nearly as good as the first one. It suffered from being too long, and probably mixing two much shockingly gross violence with humor (example, bodies flying out of a mortuary vehicle and the morgue scene). They needed to tone it down a bit."
3,Funny.. but too long,"Narcotics offiers, Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Bennett (Martin Lawrence) head up a task force investigating the flow of ecstasy into Miami. Their search leads to a dangerous Cuban kingpin, Johnny Tapia, whose plan to control the city's drug traffic has touched off an underground war. Mike and Marcus's friendship and working relationship is threatened when Mike begins to develop feelings for Marcus' sister Syd (Gabrielle Union). Unless they can separate the personal from the professional, the bad boys are in danger of blowing the case and endangering Syd's life in the process. This movie was a little more than 2 and a half hours. There were so many scenes that were repeated and unnecessary. The first Bad Boys movie was enjoyable but this one was too ""macho""."
3,Average cop action flick,"This is just a vehicle for Smith and Lawrence, if you find them entertaining, you'll enjoy this flick, it's basically the standard cops and bad guys movie with tons of shooting, violence, and the beautiful co-star in trouble. My teen age son compelled me to watch this with him, and he's definitely the target audience. I didn't find it boring, although it certainly started to get slow in a few spots. Mostly predictable, lot's of one liners and swearing, this is definitely a one time rental movie in my opionion."
2,"Good Action, Bad writing & Homophobic!","I figured the I might as well see what this film has to offer, so I rented it and discovered that -yes Michael Bay does create crazy action stunts - but the writing/dialogue is so poor. Martin Lawrence's character is almost as annoying and Eddie Murphy as the ass in Shrek. I realize that this film is designed for the hyper-macho idiot - but the stupid homophobic dialogue is really unnecessary (even if it is embraced by it's audience). Even thought Will Smith's character is the Homophobe, he does come off as the Action Film Star and continue his success in this genre. The film has a great look to it, as some very nice camera work/ effects."
4,THEY SHOOTIN!!!! MADE YOU LOOK,"Bad Boys 2 is about action, thats it and thats all. It wasnt funny,very well written or politically correct. However that being said this movie is COOL AS HELL. Now we know violence is not good but this is a MOVIE,and so i wont take off of it because it is as gruesome as a Jason flick...But Wow. This movie has the best gunfight scenes i have ever seen. It makes Heat look like The little mermaid. If you are a fan of violent shoot-em ups and explosions, and great villans be sure to cop that disc."
3,Watch just for the action scenes,"The only redeeming quality this movie has is the amazing action sequences. Other than that, its garbage compared to the first Bad Boys. They should have just left that one alone! This one isn't nearly as funny as the first, and the plot is ridiculous. Every five seconds of watching this movie (if you feel you must), you'll find yourself saying,""REALLY?!?"". Shame on you Bad Boys franchise!"
4,bad boys whatch ya gonna do!!!!!!,"Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back. This movie was great ya gotta get it now, if you like action then i know you`ll like it, but if you like plot i`d advise you look elsewhere because this movie doesnt have much of that. The action scenes were terrific, especially at the beginning and the car chases, they were pretty state of the art, this movie also has a lot of sex which i also like, the only question is why 147 minutes long?"
3,Kick ass,"This movie was so cool. Very little plot, but still good. Laugh-out-load funny and action packed. It's basicly one car chase after another, one explotion after another , one shoot out after another, and so forth. Martin Lawence is extrumely funny, especialy when he meets his duaghter's date, Reggie. So, if you are not in the mood for somthing heavy, order a pizza, have some friends over and watch Bad Boys 2."
4,Great entertainment....not so good DVD,"I enjoyed Bad Boys II. I watch movies for entertainment & comedies especially to laugh...& I did. I'm a fan of both Will Smith & Martin Lawrence & I'll watch most anything they're in. This movie was ""sexier"" than the first one [the guys looked hot!] & it surely has lots of male fantasy....things blowing up & shooting everywhere. That got a little old for me, but Smith & Lawerence kept me entertained with their chemistry. I bought the DVD & was disappointed not to find the director commentary. They do give some behind the scenes footage [like MTV making the video] but it's not the same. I love to hear the director talk about the particulars of a scene as I'm watching...it makes for great discussion. I probably wouldn't have purchased the DVD had I known there wasn't any director commentary like the first one. It's still an entertaining movie, but not as much as I hoped."
1,Weak,"This movie sucked. Plain and simple. If you are under the age of 25. This might appeal to you because you are too dense to understand plots. Car chases and shoot em up's are what is mostly on this dumb movie, which again...will appeal to these ""let's lower my 1994 honda civic and pretend it's a race car"" generation of stupid kids. Weak..."
2,Not good by any means.,"Will Smith-if you get paid 20 million dollars a movie, then should at least try and not deliver a project that is a complete pile of crap. This movie pales in comparison to the original. The airplane hangar they blew up in the first movie was constructed by Fred Howland, my granfather rest in peace."
1,2 1/2 hours of gratuitous violence,"Sorry, I usually like this sort of movie, but I found the violence to be tedious and painful to watch at times. It just keeps going and going and going. Should have only been 90 minutes not 142.The car chase on the bridge was awesome though. If you want a brain dead action movie with massive violence then this is it."
3,Almost as good as the first,"This movie has the same problem as the first only it's multiplied 10X. I would have gladly given this movie 5 stars, but it was way to violent & the language was even more out of control than the first including a sceen where Martin drops the N word like 20 times in a minute. On top of this, there were a few other things that would make this movie way inappropriate for kids or anyone really. However, with all this being said, I really enjoyed the comedic dialog between Smith & Lawrence who are two of my all-time favorites. If you like action and comedy mixed together and you don't mind a lot of trash than you'll love this movie. I don't really know if I should reccommend this one, probablly not especially for kids under 18."
2,Miami Vice rolls over in grave,"This would have garnered a one star if not for a bit of Martin Lawrence, the presence of a nice Ferrari, and the marvelously creepy guy from Fargo. Truly awful, derivative Hollywood mega-movie-sequel-itis dreck. I felt like I was watching an intellectual property / storyline rip-off of the superior Miami Vice. From drugs transported in corpses, to the inevitable showdown w/ the drug dealer on his home turf in Cuba, this film was just horrible and made one appreciate the Michael Mann's treatment the first time around in the early-80's. The ubiquitous Will Smith and his trademark smarminess are painful to watch, while sadly, Martin has to handle the straight guy role without much enthusiasm. After seeing grand cinema like the epic Return of the King, this just makes me groan. Why even bother with plot synopses, I've had enough of this."
4,Good product,It had a minor scratch on the dvd but all in all a good buy. The dvd plays fine and have not had any problems.
3,Fine movie,"It was funny and some of it was too gross to laugh however my family enjoyed it so that is all that matterd to me. I didn't care for gabraille' union role, she is too phoney for me."
4,better than i expected,"Amongst the 100's of bad action/comedy films that have been made since Die Hard, I continue watching them in hopes of good quality escapism. BB2 caught me by surprise. I found myself actually laughing out loud (very rare for me). And the special-effect car chase-and-smash scenes were phenomenal.This is not a high-brow intellectual movie by any means. It is simply what a movie should be--entertaining. The chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is great. There are a few cheesy over-the-top moments, but easily forgivable in the total context.If you just wanna have fun watching a DVD, rent this one."
3,Not Very Good,"It is entertaining, but i was asking myself through the movie is all of this necessary? The language is very crude, which is not uncommon these days but i think they went a bit too far, please don't let small kids watch it. What was Jerry thinking? How they spoke to that teenager was just unnecessary and not even funny, and they about shredded a small city during a car chasing scene, looks like they killed tons of people, and i don't think they even mentioned anything about it, they make cops look careless. I would rent this first, before buying it."
3,"Utterly stupid portrait of American cops, but the action is fun","I don't know what to say about this. I bought the DVD because i didn't go to the theater.Cons: this movie is so bad that it makes American cops look like irresponsible, quick on triggers, and dirty-mouth. You call them heros? The real cops are not like that. For the amount of irresponsibilities these two ""badboys"" had done, in reality, they would get whole department fired and jailed.Pros: the action is pretty good. For the fun of watching good guys shooting bad guys etc. It's pretty nice. Just so everybody knows that that is a fantasy."
1,"Bullets, Blood, and Cursing....typical....typical....typical","I'm not a fan of these shoot-em-up movies starting former rappers. Bad Boys 2 is no exception.It's a little ""too typical"" for me. The bad guys are brutally shot to death. The good guys get into wild cars chases which causes damage to public property. And as always, there's that one police captain who is always furious at his rouge cops but never fires them.And of course Will Smith ends up with a good-looking girl on his arm by the end of the movie."
5,Biography of Eugene Debbs,"I read this many years ago and it has remained with me ever since. It is a fascinating recounting of Mr. Debbs' lifelong battle for better treatment of workers, especially with the Pullman company, which was evil in its total disregard for the health and welfare of its workers. He ultimately formed the first union. He also was the first Socialist to run for president. The Adversary of the title was his wife who hated what he did and fought him every step of the way. I couldn't put it down."
2,pretty bad,"If you have seen the first scarecrow movie you will probally know what to expect,well I did'int and I loved the original. First of all the movie acts like the first one did'int even happen, besides that little fact I thought the movie was going to be as fun as the the first....I was WRONG!!. I could live with a diffirent story but I could'int live with really bad actors(If you thought the actors in the first were bad wait till you hear these)spitting out lines from a [bad] script, and to top it all off they put in really chessy computer effects.I would only buy this movie if it were around 5 bucks but if you can't find it that cheap just rent it."
1,P U,"This movie STINKS! The first one was at least acceptable as a B movie. This is just garbage. Seriously, my kids Goosebumps DVD's are of better acting ability, scare and quality. Movies like this belong in the toilet, with all the other....stuff."
1,A real Stinkaroo!,I have seen bad movies in my time but this one just may rank at the top of the list. If you want to see the worst special effects ever done in a movie you have to watch this turkey. I would really be embarassed for life if I was seen in this travesty by people who know me. Horrible acting and the plot is from somewhere out of this world. Also there is not one single scene in this dud that could scare you even if it came to life and jumped out of your tv screen. I certainly wouldn't invite anybody over to watch this unless they needed some sleep which they would be doing in a short while while viewing it.
1,Really really bad!,"I rented this and was shocked at how bad it was. Acting was bad, effects looked like they were done with a $200 video camera, story was laughable. Funniest thing is, Tony Todd was so serious about his role on the ""Behind the scenes"". Warning: Don't even waste money RENTING this. (Unless you just want to see how bad it was and have)"
2,Cheezy and incoherent but fun,"How can a movie with karate fighting scarecrows be all bad? The gore effects are done using video images, which is not at all convincing but still interesting. Some of the scenes are genuinely funny. Many scenes involve people getting in and out of cars.If you are a fan of these type of films, you might want to sit through this once."
1,Oh My God!!!,I can not explain how bad this movie is!I bought both of the scarecrow movies together for $5.50.I read the back and they sounded awseume.I made a huge mistake!This movie has horrible effects and horrible acting.I watched the first movie first and hated it.Then I watched this one and it made the first one look like a masterpiece.Thats how bad it is.I am beating my self up for waisting my money on this piece of crap!!It is so horrible and boring!Dont make the mistake I did.Dont even waist your money on renting this crap!Its awful!!
1,"One of the WORST ""horror"" films in history....Really bad.","This direct-to-video garbage centers around a scarecrow that takes over a college boy's soul and turns him into a killer. This is about as bad as it gets. The actors do their best. The lighting is good. The script is ok. The only person I can blame is the director and producer. As I watched this, I kept thinking ""How could you make a movie this bad? Even accidentally?"". A first year film student with an IQ of 10 could produce something more watchable than this. I love cheesy horror, but this is by far THE worst movie I've seen in 2 years! Give me 500 dollars and a crew that works for free and I could create a film 1,000 times more watchable."
2,save your money for something worth while!,"ok, there is 4 main charchters. the main guy wants to join some stupid ferternity club, so he has to go still a scarecrow. the farmer catches him, goes to shoot at the scarecrow because its coming to life and misses and hits the boy. the boys soul goes into the scarecrow and he becomes this psychotic scarecrow killing everbody except his girlfriend and his guy friend. anyways i got almost to the end but was so bored i turned the dumb show off and went and did something else. the whole scarecrow idea sounded really cool to me but this movie blows! the only reason i gave this pathetic excuse of a movie 2 stars is because it has some really cool/gory killings! this movie isn't cheesy, scary, or funny....just stupid! the only reason its rated R is for Horror (which is a load of bull), violence/gore, and language."
1,What The Hell?,"I reiterate, ""What the hell?"".. This movie appeared to be filmed by a bunch of intoxicated highschool jocks. My friend and I rented this movie for B-movie thrills, but all we found was a bunch of retarded co-eds running from a non-scary antagonist. Speaking of the antagonist, a freaking scarecrow, and to top that, it used to be one of their friends. And the way the guy was 'possessed' by the scarecrow was utterly cheesy, but still funny. It looked like a horrible techno-rave scene by some guy trying to re-create a recent acid trip.I wouldn't recommend renting, or buying this film unless you want to have a brain aneurism. Seriously, it's that bad. I suppose you could rent it just to make fun of it, but even then it's horrible. I could have made a better movie using MSDOS. That is really all I have to say about this pixelated crap-fest."
4,Enjoyable Three Horn 1950's Jazz Combo,"Most fans of cool jazz will find this album quite engaging. Although credited as a Stan Getz date on packaging, it's more like a Gerry Mulligan date - and he was the main arranger.Getz and Oscar Peterson are excellent on all the tunes. Mulligan is terrific except where he has to shoulder the lead on ""Lush Life"" - might should have rehearsed more. I was not expecting to appreciate Harry Edison too much, but overall he was not bad. His always muted trumpet was out of place on ""Woody 'n' You"" however and his solo there showed his shortcomings. Ray Brown is a solid bass man and showed that here. Herb Ellis' fills on ""Chocolate Sundae"" seemed a bit inappropriate at times but his solo there shined. Louie Bellson provided solid rhythm throughout. This is highly recommended for fans of Mulligan, Getz or Peterson."
5,A Wonderful Short Story,"This is a great story that teaches all of us, no matter how young or old we my be, lessons in character, integrity, love, and faith. A friend of mine told me about this story. I got the book to read it for myself. My thoughts were to tell the story in our Christmas eve service at the church that I pastor. I used the story to close my Christmas eve message and it was so well received. This is a great story to read to your family every year at Christmas. Family is important and this is one to be enjoyed with the ones you care about. It's one of those stories that will touch your heart. Be sure you buy some tissue too!"
1,Freedom Force as if programmed by chimps,"I would place more value on free AOL disks.Pros:The plastic CD case is reusableThe cover art is the highlight of the game.The background music seems much nicer than the rest of the game.Cons:Insipid playInadequate controlsLame story lineWeak conceptI bought itI loaded it onto my machineI rebooted my machine to ""play"" this dreck.Playing for a little while, thinking ""this has got to get better soon"", no, no, no it doesn't. Superman on the Atari 2600 was way better.This appears to be more an ambitious school project than a professional game."
2,not up to par,Not near as good as there two prior releases. About 3 decent sons. Ronnie does better with the beal growl not the high pitched squeal. Worth a spin but that is about it.
1,"I'm the most hardore ever, and you can never understand me","I don't like rock or whatever you call this, but as people metal heads (or whatever you like to call yourselves) keep reviewing rap albums, and leaving your moronic opinons on their, i thought i'd do the same.I'm hardcore, check it out.I feel that this album touches the deep reccess of my soul and explains to me the pain and agony of my generation. No one can understand this like me, for i am the only one who can truely comprhend the incomprehinsble vocals, and the loud throbbing noise you call a beat."
5,Does the job,The charger does what it's supposed to do. What more is there to say about such an humble product?
4,Tsarskaya nevesta,"This is better than nothing, I'd say. Much better was Galina Vizhneskaya and Irina Arkhipova's version. A pitty this version does not exist anymore. Less dramatic, less ""true""...As very often Gergiev does...Martin"
4,A must have book!!!,A complet high performance aviation book! Good reference for those who seek knowlege improvement! A must have book! I strongly recommend
1,The Story of my Life,"The book was very boring. Helen Keller had no sense of the facts or of time. She kept refering to ""seeing"" and ""hearing"". Wasn't she blind AND deaf? She would talk about her father dying and then talk about doing something with him. The book did not make any sense at all. I highly recomend not reading this book unless you HAVE to for school. Read a Helen Keller book not written by her or by Anne Sullivan."
5,"Amazing, Wonderful and Inspiring",This book made me see things more clearly through a life of a deaf and blind person and a relationship built on trust behind Helen and Anne grow into a wonderful friendship. How Helen managed to Got to college and graduate like an normal person who can hear and see is wonderful and amazing and then travel the world and a public speaker of all and also write books and the one about her life. As having a hearing problem myself after reading this book I felt better about myself and the see my self a the same as everyone else. I would like to buy it but I seem to be able to get it anywhere. I recommend the book to every one to read
3,"Sightless and unable to hear, but hardly mute.",Helen Keller gives a sweetly innocent rundown of her life in this brief book. It's just enough to get a glimpse into her well publicized transformation into a girl lost in her own inability to communicate to a wonderfully prolific soul; a person who changed the world. She is disarming and self aware and isn't afraid to gloss over a little bit of the struggle to paint a journey of searching that led to many rivers of experience. It's a charming book and if one is curious about Helen Keller it is best to 'hear' the words from the author than another source.
4,Helen Keller-a remarkable person and writer,"In my own personal opinion, Helen wrote a book that not only offered hope for those with disabilites, but one that also shared her MANY talents.Its amazing to read about her childhood in the beginning of her life because, she was struck with her life long disabilities at only 19 months. In her book, The Story Of My Life, she shares all her emotions in such good detail and it really took me back to realize that this woman had to express her self in that way because she couldnt see or much less hear.I just think that her book is so awesome and I love reading it and knowing that people take so much for granted."
4,"Excelent story, but her discriptions of life are sceachy.","I have read 3 books on her and this was the most detailed but had the least amount of the stories that are attributed to her. These sceans are of the fight in the kitchen, and the destruction of her first doll. On the other hand it showed her reactions to her most valued possesions and reactions of others. Over all I thought that this was a fonaminal book."
2,Not the best,I could not get through this book. I do not like the way it was written. Definitely not an easy read if that is what you are looking for.
5,story of my life,The book talks about the author life and her education. Helen Keller became deaf and blind when she was nineteenth month because of the fever that she had. I like this book because there is a theory that says nothing impossible to learn. The author approved that blind and deaf people can do the same as others maybe more. I like how she struggled with learning and how other people around her influence her positively. She is really a successful woman who makes other people proud of what she has done and also not to give up easily.
4,Helen Keller: The Story of My Life,"This book gives a lot of courage and hope to the reader. It emphasizes the same life lesson that we have heard over and over again, ""go for your dreams, and never let anything get in the way,"" yet it some how sticks out this time because it comes from such a remarkable person. It did, however go into way too much detail about her reading hobby and friends. Overall the book gave be more hope and inspiration than anyone else ever has to never give up on any of my dreams in life no matter what barriers and obstacles get in the way."
5,An EXCELLENT BOOK!!,I thought that this book was a very good book because it said a lot how Helen Keller overcame deafness and blindness and was able to talk in many different languages!! It is a truely inspiring book!
1,"Although listed as a Book on CD, when it arrived it was a book on Cassette..",My library is slowly getting rid of their books on cassette and when I got rid of this title I was looking for a CD replacement. Right after it arrived I attempted to contact the seller and ask what we could do--and I have yet (after several weeks) to receive an answer. Basically I've just thrown a bit of my library budget into the trash.
4,How could this fail to be fascinating . .,"Although Helen Keller's style is at times overly idealistic and flowery, her insights into her own peculiar way of seeing the world are absolutely invaluable. She has truly penetrating things to say not only about famous figures of the time who she was able to meet (including Alexander Graham Bell), but also about spirituality, literature, and countless other realms of experience."
3,Boring,"The Story of my Life, by Helen Keller, had a lot of information but it was boring. I never wanted to pick it up. The book is mostly letters she sent to her family and trust me...you will get tired of reading letters!"
5,From the most talented musical family in rock!,"Comes this exceptional CD. Oklahoma, Get What You Got Comin, At Least I'm Free are great rockers. Heart of An Angel and Alive are just beautifully put together. No this is not Second Helping or Special Forces, but so what. This shows the depth of these brothers writing abilities. These songs do fit with Skynyrd and Special in that they tell a story and have such a positive energy. My wife is a country music fan and when she saw the band in Atlanta fell in love with the music and bought additional copies for her and my son. As you can tell I just love this music and these guys. They did themselves proud!"
3,Face Masks,Product provides the protection my husband requires as a Double Lung Transplant. Easy to use and carry with us as we are out and about.
5,Wow! what a trompeter!!,"Never had a more positive surprise listening to music. Mr. Smith is absolutely amazing. Having Cannonball on his side obviously improves the quality of the album. But the main attraction is Louis Smith who cseems to be inspired by Clifford but where others fail to play ""up there"", Louis manages and at the same time has his own distinct sounds and phrases. What a joy!"
5,Mr Brewster has the wrong recording,"The reason for Mr Brewster's confusion is that he is referring to another recording, from which, going by titles, this may have been extracted. The recording referred to is ""Al Jolson Live: Radio Prime Time Performances"" - or something very close to that, and it is also listed by Amazon. That recording features a ""different"" Al Jolson. But for about 3 tracks, gone is the backface performer, and a sensitive interpreter of some older and very beautiful songs emerges. See my review for that particular recording, it is a gem not to be missed, and with its 28 excellent tracks is a purchase of better value."
5,simply the best,"The best book there is in English on the game. Organized as follows:Part One: The Official Game.1. The Mah Jong Set2. Preliminaries3. Playing4. ScoringPart Two: Alternatives, Variations and Additions.1. The Mah Jong Set2. Preliminaries3. Playing4. Scoring5. American ScoringPart Three: Strategy.1. Luck and Skill2. Offensive Strategy3. Defensive Strategy"
2,Not any good for concealment,"Ordered this product for off-duty carry of my cuffs and spare mag. I liked the paddle option as my current case requires a take my belt off to disarm. However, when I received the case, I realized just how overly massive this it is. There's at least a quarter inch, probably closer to three-eights between the paddle and case itself (I know my pants aren't that thick), plus no curvature at all to keep it close to my hip. Secondly, I ordered a size 4 for my HK USP magazines, and there is an excessive amount of play in the mag pouch, so much that if you're running, your mag is gonna come out. The cuff pouch is also larger than needs to be, does not fit S&W; 100 cuffs securely, but gives them plenty of room to make some noise.I give it two stars for quality leather, but it's not gonna work for my needs."
2,The Midnight Lion: Gustav Adolf - The Greatest Lutheran Layman,"I have read books that were written in a much clearer style (to say the least.) The subject was of interest to me, but the author wasn't able to keep me reading."
5,worth every penny!,"a bit pricey, but worth every penny. great directions; great hold on mirror -- and the tilt mirror -- magnifying on one side, regular on the other works very well. telescoping arm is firm, but can be manipulated so that it stays put. good value, good product."
2,Okay - but very pricey for what I got,"The mirror is excellent - almost too much magnification - but the apparatus that extends and holds the mirror is stiff, not great in the adjustment department, and it is very expensive for what I got, in my opinion. I will be surprised if it will last and work very well for more than a year - used not for travel but in my home."
4,"A wacky mixture, but it works","It makes sense if you have seen the show (the first show I know of to be based on prerecorded music), but if you haven't this is a wacky mixture of classical, jazz, and rock/pop dance numbers, and if you have eclectic tastes it is certainly entertaining listening. The version of Beyond the Sea is pretty weak, with Bobby Darin's version being about a thousand times better, but other than that it is hard to quarrel with any of the music."
2,A hodgepodge...and a TONY WINNER?????,"Where have they gone wrong? A Tony winner for pre-recorded music? What a mistake -- how it beat out the competition is behind me! Structured like ""Fantasia"" with disparate styles and music, it works better on stage. The CD comes off like a hodgepodge with no cohisive basis or connection to the other segments. Better to see it in the theatre -- or maybe on video, if there is to be one. The Lady in Yellow is so dynamic in person that I missed her listening to the music. And where is Van Morrison's ""Moon Dance""? Overall, a disappointment."
2,Hodge-podge ain't the half of it,"Love Stro (especially her work in The Producers), but who did she have to sleep with to get a Tony for this dreck??? It's so jarring to have classical one minute and rock the next. The real stunner -- on stage at least -- is The Girl in the Yellow Dress segment. What proceeds it is so ho-hum and unmemorable. As a CD this is Strictly Resistible.My copy of this CD went to Goodwill after one spin. At five bucks it'll be worth it, but not a penny more."
1,Hodge podge of music from an overrated show,"All the music here is pleasant enough, but it also shows how absolutely insignificant the show is. Critics raved about how Contact was the savior of musical theatre. Is this the emperor's new clothes? Obviously, those critics didn't pay ... a ticket for what was basically a mildly entertaining set of dance pieces that you might see on a television variety special. This album with no original music (save Boyd Gaines' version of the song) is a slap in the face to all original cast albums."
3,"Not as good as ""Dress..."" but worth a listen.","Calvin Krime have three different kinds of albums they wanted to make here. They wanted to make a great follow up to their blistering debut album ""Dress For The Future,"" and they do so in the songs ""Die Beautiful,"" ""Fantabuloso,"" and ""Hunt The Wumpus."" Then they decide to jump on the emo and electronica bandwangons and everything falls apart. ""411 N. 6th St."" has a massive chorus with crushing guitars and bass and a beautiful melody, but the rest of the song tries too hard to be a maudlin pop ballad. ""Sea Lions Trained to Hug"" is a good song with cool guitar synth interactions, but feels out of place with the rest of the album. and on and on. Calvin Krime are only batting .500 on this album, and it's a shame, because ""Dress For The Future"" showed up how could they could have been. Note: Calvin Krime broke up four months after this album was released."
3,Butterflies Permanent Birthday Calendar,"The size of the overall calendar is great, however, the lines in which to write people's names are rather narrow. Also the quality of the paper used is not as good as I expected. It's a little flimzy."
1,small and cheap,"Keep in mind when purchasing this item that you get what you pay for. I was hoping for a larger calendar with room to put in dates of many family members. I received a small, aprox 4x6 tablet with 10-12 lines under each month for names and dates. Not what I hoped for so naurally I was dissapointed."
4,Nice Artwork,"It is just what it's supposed to be. Perfect for keeping track of birthdays. The only downfall that I can see is that if there is more than one birthday on the same date, then you might have a problem."
2,Say It In Russian,"Its OK. I was surprised that it doesn't teach you to count or the alphabet. It's more geared towards vocabulary than conversation, so if you want to say, ""This is my window"" in Russian, than this is the one for you."
5,"This Is What I Call ""Danceable Movie Funk"".....Ya Dig?","just got my copy in the mail today.right now i'm playing ""Joe Bell"" after like playing 5 times already!..this set is what i call ""Danceable Movie Funk"" meaning that you can get on the dancefloor and groove to this music as well...and ""A House Full Of Girls?"".....THAT SONG IS OWNING ME..it's sensual.it's 70's( and that's not a bad thing either given that i was born a year before this came out:)....if you're a fan of the 70's soundtracks-especially of the african-american genre, RUN..DON'T WALK to buy your copy of this set. you won't be disappointed. i'm not.Love, Peace And Hair grease ya'll!"
5,Nursing 2006 Drug Handbook,"I have used this product for years in my nursing practice. I depend upon the ""Nursing Considerations"" section to assist me with patient teaching and care planning."
3,DRUG HANDBOOK,"HAVE BEEN USING THIS BOOK FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS-GENERALLY GOOD, HAVE NOTICED SOME DRUGS MISSING OR DIFFICULT TO CROSS REFERENCE...ALSO LACKING IN ""ACTION OF MEDICATION""INFORMATION."
2,Not at all what I was expecting!,I have watched the first series that came out on television. The first Christy was amazing to watch and share in the lives with the characters on screen or in the book. But after they found a new Christy to play the part in the continuing stories on dvd it all went down hill. It does not have a clear picture and the people that play in it are not relaxed or do well in their parts.
3,Disappointed,"After watching the whole 2 seasons of TV episodes, we eagerly watched the PAX movies. (sigh) I guess our expectations were too high. Just NOT the same. Neil the doctor and a few of the residents are the only actors you'll recognize. The Miss Alice character is milk toast. The reverend has no passion for Christy. None of the set is even in the same geographical place. The structures are all of an era 50 yrs later. Everyones clothes are 20 to 30 yrs later and NO ONE IS DIRTY. I guess if all you watch are the 3 PAX movies, you'll be ok."
4,MOVIE,FIRST IN A SET OF THREE MOVIES THAT I LOVE WITH THIS CAST. I would recommend this film to anyone wanting to see a good wholesome movie set in Appilachia
2,Disappointed!!,I loved the TV show and was disappointed when Pax stopped showing it and I was very happy when I heard that they were making new movies but unfortunately I have to say I was disappointed and couldn't get interested in this movie.
1,A tad disappointed,"The 1 star is for the cast who returned from the CBS series, especially Steward Finlay-McClennan's Dr. MacNeil! Having loved the series & the book, I was a bit disappointed with Lauren Lee Smith, Tyne Daly & Sam W. portrayals of key characters. The original series' cast (Kellie Martin, Tyne Daly & Randall Batinkoff) were much more realistic & believable (the movies sometimes had over-acting... ah, what could have been!). All in all, perhaps 'newbies' could start with the series before seeing the movies. For Christy fans who have a hard time swallowing Smith's performance over Kellie Martin's (or Miss Alice & David), I'd think twice before buying the movies."
1,Christy - A Change of Seasons,"As I had watched the original series, the differences were very apparent in the change of actors, location and characters and even the theme of the story. It would have been nicer to have had the ending of the original series as the flow wasn't good. I was very disappointed with their new take on the original series."
5,Mummy Review,This is the absoulute best movie ever. My dad bought it for me. It's the only thing that my brother and I can watch with out killing each other. I love Rath and Nefer-Tina. I have their pictures in my locker at school. Before a test I always say with the strengh of ra. I've gotten a's and b's ever sence. Now all I need to do is buy all the action figures.
5,"MUMMIES! Man, how I have missed this show!",this was one of my favorite shows as a child and Scott Mcneil is the best!!! I can't wait to buy this!!
5,Staple Singers-City in the Sky,I have owned the vinyl copy of this since it was released and has been a top album for me. The CD version is just outstanding with 2 added songs that I love also.
5,Excellent Reading Tool,This was a recommended product. It is worth all that was originally shared with me. While strengthening my daughters reading skills her comprehension skills have also improved.
5,"Out of Print? Say it ain't so, Joe!","One of my all time favorites, and absolutely one of the best albums of the '80s. It's hard to believe a CD this great would go out of print, but search around and you can find it. It will be time well spent.Joe Jackson and his band make some great '80s pop music here, while touching on a diverse collection of musical styles. And, they still manage to be witty and sophisticated (lyrically and musically.) All of this - without synthesizers, drum machines, or synth drums. Maybe that's why the music doesn't sound nearly as dated as much of the music from that time.I won't go into individual highlights, because this ones all highlights!! I will add this is one of the finest sounding live albums you'll ever hear. There's a crisply recorded natural live sound without a lot of audience noise. I put this right up there with Gabriel's Secret World Live and GD Live Dead as one of my favorite live albums.Shawn"
3,Many questions - possible answers,"Thomas, who was brought up Christian, is now being confronted by different views from with in and with out the church. He is given an opportunity to witness to some Buddhists and at that moment realizes he does not know what to believe. How will he resolve this dilemma?I am not sure whom this book is trying to address. John Cobb gets to play both sides of the fence in asking genuinely interesting questions and giving fairly decent answers. However in the process he leads both sides to his conclusion. There is much to make you think and there is even a section (Discussion Questions) that clearly state the questions that arise in the book."
1,The Last Time I Saw Paris,I enjoy the movie or else I wouldn't have ordered it. However the quality of the film was very poor. It was grainy and the sound was not good quality. I was disappointed.
1,poor quality picture,"I recently purchased a copy of the movie ""The Last Time I Saw Paris"". It is one of my favorite films. As I watched the picture I noticed that the quality was very poor. White spots and reel scratches were prevelent throughout the film. It was evident that no work had been done to clean it up. I think it is terrible to treat such a great picture in this manner.It should not be sold to the public until work has been done to restore the picture to it's original condition.a"
5,TAYLOR SHINES,"I don`t know how 2 say it. I saw Cleopatra, Who`s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Ivanhoe, Giant, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, A Date With Judy, the Lassie films, National Velvet, Butterfield 8, Suddenly Last Summer A N D it turned out to BE THIS FILM that really made me an Elizabeth Taylor fan. She is playing a wonderfully off-beat character and she is sooooooo natural. She is a delight, as are Van Johnson. Eh, poor Donna Reed. This is a poor performance from the then-recent Academy Award Winner for Best Supporting Actress - Alma in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY. Her Alma in that film was a performance with nuances. Just for the record: It was EVA n o t ZSA ZSA who had a supporting role in this film."
2,How Original--A Frustrated Writer!,"Uh-oh, here we go again with the ""if only I could write the novel that's in me"" character, this time played by Van Johnson, who can't really seem to make a go of his marriage to free-spirited Elizabeth Taylor. He drinks, she's a little too free-spirited. Had a hard time believing he would start to mess around with that Gabor woman when there's a Liz in his life. Walter Pidgeon shambles about as Liz's dad, Donna Reed looks pained and pinched as Liz's sister who sort of lost Van to Liz. Cloying child actress as the daughter of Van and Liz annoying. There's also something about the quality of the film they've been showing on NYC's Channel 13/PBS that makes me wonder whether it was recovered from a safe on the Andrea Doria.I hope this was ""The Last Time I Saw"" this movie."
2,I enjoyed the paris backdrops not much else,"Cute and funny when it needs to be. Too drippy and inane when it tries to be sentimental.Van Johnson is a WW2 correspondent who manages to fall in love with Elizabeth Taylor, in a more amazing move Elizabeth Taylor falls in love with Van Johnson! Walter Pigeon appears as the eccentric father of the bride and Donna Reed is the older sister who tries to run the family with good sense and is often rebuffed.When everyone is poor and struggling things hold together but when the family falls into money then everything crashes down. The journalist proves he doesn't have the great American novel (or great Paris novel wither in him). Each struggles with problems and they slowly drift apart. He to the bottle and she to another man.Then things turn sappy and sentimental and whatever charm this movie has evaporates rapidly. All the characters are so self centered I thought at first I was watching a ""Thirty-Something"" flashback set in the 40s."
2,Premise is Old and Tired,"I did not find the premise for this movie to hold up. Van Johson is a frustrated writer with a drinking problem. Elizabeth Taylor is tolerable like most WWII Wives, but starts to play the field herself after a while. She gets ill and dies because of his ""malice"" towards her while he is drunk. All this is fine and could be pieced together to make a lovely, if sentimental, drama, but Van Johnson acts poorly, and even Elizabeth Taylors Fine Performance can not make the script any more exciting than it is. All in All, Even Though I am a huge Elizabeth Taylor Fan, this Movie is Dull. Rent A Place In The Sun, Butterfield 8, Giant or Cleopatra."
2,Liz Taylor,"A reporter falls in love and marries a woman. He has a job and writes novels. He gives up writing. The marriage falters. With the NR rating, I was expecting at least one nude scene, but no go. I thought it was a kind of sappy romance. I wouldn't want to see it again."
2,ONE OF THE WORSE ROAN GROUP RELEASES!,"The Roan Group usually represents an exceptional product that one will buy on name alone, regardless of the DVD title. Past releases have offered versions of public domain titles that far outshined the other companies by somehow obtaining original nitrite or archival quality prints. But with the purchase of their version of ""The Last Time I Saw Paris"", I have come to realize that even Roan Group is capable of a bum product.Do yourself a favor, and pass on this one. Even Alpha offers a better print than this!UPDATE - 2012The Warner Archive has now released a beautiful print of this film which presents it in its correct aspect ratio of 1.75:1, and the techicolor is GORGEOUS! Look for copies here on Amazon, alot cheaper than the Warner Archive website."
1,Poor Quality,Bought this movie as a gift. Excellent movie however the quality of the movie is very very poor. Would not recommend buying. Appears to be a copy of another. Would of returned it but there is a no return unless unopened (that makes no sense).
5,Elizabeth Taylor Really Can Act! Great Romance Video!,"This movie is one the greatest romance movies! It would have made a great Valentine's Day present, but Mother's Day would still be a good time to give it as a gift. I was surprised of Ms. Taylor's acting ability! A TRUE Classic."
5,This film is one of the best---EVER!,"I can't believe I actually bought this movie and LOVED it. I always seem to get the bad ones, but this one was simply the best. Taylor and Gabor shines in this movie!"
3,Thanks for the memories,The movie stopped mid-way through. I think we have corrected the problem. Thanks for the quick delivery on our order. Elizabeth Taylor was just about the last of the old great movie Stars. We still have Lauren Bacall.
2,Missing episodes...?,My husband and I are avid fans of the office and I bought him these DVDs for Christmas. Unfortunately it appears that we are missing one of the episodes from season 7.
5,Timothy Olyphant is terrific.,I rented this episode to see Timothy Olyphant who aced it with this veteran ensemble. Great episodes. I love the name Broccoli Rob.
3,"Great, but for a few damaged areas my computer skipped.","The product was delivered in a timely matter in great condition. Upon watching, however, my computer struggled with at least 2 damaged areas on 2 separate discs. The damaged areas would not play through, and I was not able to view certain small segments of The Office season 7."
5,Great transaction,I bought this dvd for my kids and it shipped on time and was in condition advertised. Thanks for a great transaction!
1,The download came up scrambled and I spent an hour trying to figure out how to get a refund.,"Amazon seems to have no way to refund a poor download. I downloaded to TIVO......My TIVO works fine, all other downloads that day worked fine. Amazon needs to make it just a little apparent of how to deal with this. I gave up trying to figure it out and will purchase future downloads somewhere that has an apparent customer service department for these things."
3,Funny episode,This episode is ok and it is a little different in that we get introduced to a new salesman joining the team. The actor playing this new salesman is not particularly funny but the casts reaction to him is. Good idea for mixing up a somewhat static group. Much needed addition if the series is going to go for another season.
5,Slammin!!!!!,"This a slammin episode. As if the other ones weren't. They also have something new and so fuuuuuunnnnnnyyyyy!!! I laugh so hard sometimes that I forget that I have back pain. I hope they continue for years to come but if they don't thank God, for series dvds. I just can't get enough of these crazzzyyyy people! I love them!!!!"
3,DVD,"Was a Christmas present, all dvds were there, don't really know to much , fast shipping. great price, don't know if they have been veiwed yet"
5,A Must-Have,"Although we will all lament Steve Carell's leaving the show (which puts a slight damper on what's to come), Season 7 is brilliant. The writers and directors really outdid themselves to make this season funnier than ever. A must-have for anyone who wants to see the employees of Dunder Mifflin at their finest! Because I'm pre-ordering it I hope that they include some good extras on the DVD. I expect there to be some sort of ""Good-bye Steve"" montage on the last disk. Hope I'm right- he deserves it!"
5,Awesome,"I believe the series speaks for itself, if you've never seen it then obviously you're not going to buy this season first. Love the office and definitely recommend it to anyone!"
4,"Cute shoes, hard sole",These shoes are adorible. They are very hard though. Not a lot of give. They are definitly worth the price. I would recommend!
2,Pretty Bad,"This movie is really really a stinker. All the action is poorly done, and comes off even cheasier then it should. Most of the acting is horrible, and the story is bland. Nothing in this movie does what it should (hello it can't even keep its religions straight). I would say that it was because of a low budget, but the movie had $12,000,000. They could at least have made some of the fights look good, but sadly no. If you are in need of a good horror movie rent ""Kolobos"" or ""Bloody Murder"" (the latter is super cheesy and low budget but is way better then this movie). Try something else because this is a pretty lame movie. Although it is still better then ""End Of Days""."
2,A glorious high school production,"This production of Aida should, unlike small children, be heard but not seen. One imagines that, having paid for Mr. Pavorotti, La Scala had insufficient funds for sets and costumes. The triumphal march was a travesty. Glorious singing indeed, but I already have a wonderful CD; I was hoping for a fine, or at least good performance. Not here."
2,Pavarotti and Chiara in CONCERT!,"This is an incredible Aida for Luciano Pavarotti. I have never heard him in such a good voice for a dramatic tenor role. But please cut off the video and just hear him otherwise you will be extremely disappointed by this DVD. The acting is so so bad (by everyone). Pavarotti having his knee problem never moved on stage. Chiara's acting is even worse. Dimitrova has an ugly voice. The best amneris I ever heard was Ghorr in the Solti, Vickers , Price recording.OVerall....NOT recommended...the MET production with Domingo, millo is excellent!"
2,wish it was a CD...,"Lots was written and I will keep mine short:Good: Superb cast [stronger on the male side] with many of them at their pick. Good singing.Not good: all the rest!Visually disturbing production: Incredibly busy set [looks like Arizona not Egypt, by the way], less than pleasing costumes and set design.Horrible Ballet scenes and even worse acting by some of the main characters [with trophy for worse actor divided between Pavarotti and Dimitrova].Technically the recording is poor, uneven with even the smallest of background noises heard. One of the reviewers mentioned it is noticeable using his high-end headphones - I will argue it is true to listening on regular speakers [my DVD is connected to surround].Last [and this is a question of personal taste]: I am totally unconvinced by Lorin Maazel's musical interpretation - it sounds to me as a pale, colorless Aida.Two stars [instead of one] because of the cast - but it is not something I would keep in my library."
3,Where's Price when you need her....,good production--radames was too big--maria was a o.k. aida-- she did too many hand movements--it was distracting---the costumes were awful--as a black man i was offend by the makeup job---it was horrible--nobody black ever looked like that... to see a true aida--watch Leontyne Price final performane in 1985 .. you will see the true AIDA----
3,Very good!!,"This performance of ""Aida"", despite from other reviews say, has a great production, The scenario is Wonderfull.Chiara is a great performer of Aida, with that dark powerfull voice of dramatic soprano, her acting isn't great but is better than Pavarotti's or (most of all) Dirmitrova. I never seen a woman moove so little on stage. But the worst of all is the ballet in the triunfal march ¡¡there isn't any ballet!!.Vocally I find this performance great, but in matters of acting isn't that good.The Orchestra is perefctly displayed here, Maazel does a great job.I would rate with 5 stars If I would be thinking in the voices and the orchestra but If I had to rate acting I would put 2 stars. I keep with 3 stars"
1,Aida Amateur Night!,"If you want a good Aida video, get The Met version with Domingo and Millo, Zajick, Milnes and a fantastic production from begininng to end. This La Scala version is almost funny it's so bad. The singers just stand like statues staring at the conductor - not even an attempt to act the roles or relate to each other. The sets are comical and the costumes off someone's old rack. Unless you are a real fan of the cast members (Pav is in good voice doing his concert schitchk, arms outstreched, eyes closed & the usual ""don't you just love me grin"" on his face; Dimitrova stiffly swoops and screams her way through, eyes glued to the conductor; Chiara has poses and so-so voice with -0- emotion). Too bad The Met isn't available on DVD. I have tape and LD. Even on tape, it's better than this version. Boring is the word for this performance. Verdi would not approve!! PASS ON IT!"
4,Pavarotti's Acting!!!!,I love this DVD for the fact that Pavarotti's singing is marvelous. AIDA was overacting the whole time but the Amneris was great. My biggest issue was the triumphal scene where I think the direcor over did it. That scene seemed to be overcrowded and a lot of confusing moving rocks behind the scenery. The conductor Lorin Maazel did a great job in conducting this marvelous piece. The Scala Chorus and Orchestra were also marvelous as always. One more thing....I always expect to see beautiful dancing during the ballet sessions of the opera but in this production there is no ballet at all. In one scene there were a whole bunch of kids jumping and running during Amneris longing for Radames whom she loves. During the triumphal scene the ballet was coreographed with slaves begging for food (whom they looked like hungry birds picking up breads)there was a soldier tossing breads at the slaves.....unbelievable!!!I didn't like this part. I thought it was confusing and out of context.
5,"so far, so good","Seems to be a real solid product. As long as it protects my equipment as advertised, I'll be happy. So far, so good.Wanted to mention that part of the reason I got this, was to be able to truly kill the power to all the things I have connected to it with just a flip of a switch. Electronics continue to use power even when they are supposedly turned off,and run up your power bill for nothing. Since I have been using this, my power bill has gone down noticeably. Good for me and good for the environment."
5,Great Value,"I bought this on recommendation from a friend of mine who owns one. I bought a 42"" plasma screen a couple of years ago and with it I bought a monster surge protector with the clean power filter built in. The monster unit burnt out recently which prompted me to look elsewhere since the monster unit smelled like it would have caught fire had I not been home to find it was broke. I've only had this for a couple of days but so far so good, and I've noticed an improved picture over the monster unit even. This unit is very heavy duty where the monster unit was lightweight and made of all plastic. Best of all is that this was way less expensive than the products I looked at locally and this seems to be top of the quality as far as how it's built. I don't think I'll be having to buy a new one in the next 5 years so I'm happy."
3,Way too close outlets,"Bought this for my home office.The pictures are a bit deceptive. The outlets are very closely spaced, some of the ""power brick"" connectors that have unusual positioning doesn't fit in here without taking up 2-3 outlets. Instead of 10, I could only use about 6. Unless the plugs are standard 3 prongs, be prepared to give up several outlets.I don't know if it's a technical limitation or not, but if Tripp Lite could make the outlets rotate or even better, rotate and be placed a further apart, I'd rate it as a 5. Also, most homes have only 1 or 2 coax cables (cable and over-the-air). 3rd is redundant and could have been removed for more space for plugs.For the price, I think they could have added more (current usage display (Watts), surge records, etc.) After all, 30-40 more dollars and this could be a UPS.I have not had any power events since I bought this, so I can't tell about the surge protection."
4,re labeling,I know it is very good product and that's why I bought itthe only one thing to me is the socket labeling are bad becausewhen you work on dim lighting conditon and you need flashlight to shine on this unit then you will get the reflectionsnd you would not be able to see the lable letter any moreesppecially they using gold color letters!
2,the mount should be on the outside,"Ok it came in the mail real nice & then, the mount should be on the outside not the inside. The cords sometimes come out too. U should mount it out of the way. I've had better things than this thing. Get real and get a battery backup. This is a silly device and not worth the price."
5,Item as described.,So far so good. I just hope that this item wont break down just like the other surge protector item I bought.
4,I Mostly Like It,"I like feeling that my myriad ""units"" are well protected. This product seems solid and well made. My only complaint is that I wish the coax receptacles were further apart, so I could tighten/loosen them more easily."
5,This Is Amazing! HDTV Has Been Saved From a Bad Storms,"So far... we feel safer using our Tripp Lite surge protector! Before we bought this Tripp Lite HT10DBS and hooked it up, our 42"" HDTV had been disabled twice by nearby lightening. Our HDMI inputs stopped working (""No Signal""). So, after we hooked up the Tripp Lite HT10DBS, our HDTV has been working. We live in FL which is known to have severe lightening storms in the summer. Another good thing about this protector is that the picture in our HDTV has become really crisp and clear. I'm very pleased!"
5,Great Do-It-All Surge Protector,"My header pretty much says it. I have been able to now protect my telephone, coaxial TV Antenna, CAT5 router, and all my power bricks all with one device. After losing several thousand $$ from a nearby lightning strike that crept in on my phone line, I looked for the best protector I could find and I feel this is it. I ended up buying two additional smaller Tripp Lite protectors because I liked everything this one offered."
1,Stay away from Tripp Lite,"All products seem to have good features at a reasonable price, but their customer service is the worst!!! I had 5 different units in my house for computer and home audio use, but I had such a bad experience with filing a claim due to a surge that I threw away all of the units. I replaced them with APS units. So far, no problems. By the way, Tripp Lite customer service does not even have a toll-free phone line. That was my first hint that I was in for a bad experience."
5,Reba is Great,Reba is great. Never thought she could pull off a comedy like this. Highly recommend Reba.
4,DVDs Worth Watching,"Seeing Reba McEntire on ""Reba"" is definitely something different. She laughs, cries and yells alot but that's Reba Hart's character. A family who loves each other but at times it's difficult to get along and they also have tough times. Then there's the big blonde dingy one who married Reba's ex-husband, Brock...Barbra Jean. Brock, Barbra Jean, Van & Cheyenne, Kira, Jake and Elizabeth..they all make ""Reba"" work."
1,HOW COULD I HAVE BELIEVED THESE 5 STAR REVIEWS?,"This moronic program, starring the insufferable Reba McEntire is one of the worst programs in the history of television. The glowing 5 star reviews here are obviously from people who like to see trash (ala Roseanne) and seem to find it funny. This type of program is what is wrong with television and America today and the wasteland it has become. McEntire is a hippocrite with a gargantuan ego to boost!! I wouldn't make her any richer than she already is by buying into this mishmash of stupidity. She ought to be ashamed of herself, but of course she'll do anything to make a buck and keep her name in front of the public. Goodness knows she can't do it with her singing anymore. But let me tell you, she can't act worth a hoot either."
1,Sorely Disappointed,"I have watched a couple of Reba's episodes and I found them to be merely o.k. Not offensive, merely innocuous. So I decided to buy this DVD set (as I am a collector of TV series). To say that I am sorely disappointed is an understatement. McEntire knows how to milk an audience but her timing is drastically off which throws the rest of the cast playing off of her. The episodes are merely innocuous and harmless but definitely not the stuff that classics are made of."
1,STUPID SHOW WITH EGOMANIAC REBA AT THE HELM,"There was only one redhead comedienne who could stop the show....Lucille Ball. Reba needs to stop thinking she can top her. Never in my life have I seen anyone who can overact so much!! She doesn't want anyone to top her. But that is typical, envious, competetive Reba. This program is a stupid program about the functionalism of dysfunctionalism. It is a waste of time and money. But that's what people like. No wonder our country is in the sad shape its in. The DVD is top notch. Too bad the series is one grade below low class."
1,Show should have been cancelled right there and now.....,"First season of this piece of trash was just one follow up of unfunny jokes after another. In one episode, Reba gets to sing, and that's reason enough to turn off the TV set and sell your copy on E-Bay."
5,Reba season one,What can I say ... It is Reba ... She is great in everything she does ... Super lady ... All her shows are great
5,I love Reba!,Love the series! Bought it as gift and she also loved it! Loooking forward to buying the rest of the seasons.
2,Well...,"Reba is one of my moms all time favoret shows so i found the first season on line of course im going to buy it for her. but when i got it, i was a little dissapointed. i mean yeah mom still loved it but it look like something from Movie Galery and they couldnt sell it after the store went under. the cases were in really bad shape and the discs wernt much better. i had to pay to get them resurfesed and all together i spent more than i should have."
2,Rattling DVD,"It is a Christmas gift. It has not been opened. But, I can hear a rattling in it like something is broken. I tried to find a place at amazon.com to send an email about the product with no luck at all. I am afraid that the disk may be broken inside. But I did not want to open it, because it was a gift. I cannot rate it because I am not sure. But since you insisted that I do, I gave it 2 stars."
5,Funny stuff,"If you like comedy with a little bit of seriousness, this item is for you. My daughter and I watch a couple of episodes once or twice a week for our time together. She's 14 and I'm a 52 in age. So the show is for anyone of any age. Would recommend."
2,Aoh-oh - another series about a divorcee...But there is a good Arena Football 1 connection to this series in one episode...,Look for Van Montgomery as the H.Coach ofArizona and the ArenaBowl XVI pennant.Good exposure in the popular culturefor America's best (new) sport!
5,Reba Season 1,"I compare this show to the likes of Lucy! Funny, entertaining and a joy to watch. It will bring laughter into your home. The writers of this series are phenomenal! All characters blend together to make this one of the best comedies in TV history!"
5,Reba Season 1,Reba's show is the best. It always makes you laugh and the characters are loveable despite their flaws...ie: stealing their now bestfriends husband. If you have not watched the show check your local listing and give it a try...you will not be disapointed!
1,REBA? What's Next...Shania? Faith? Martina???,They don't have to create a sitcom to make me laugh at country music divas over acting all over the place. The episode where Cheyenne (Reba's daughter) tells Reba that she's pregnant and Reba registers shock (for all of 20 seconds) then says...oh well...then the pregnancy becomes the joke of the entire season?? What kind of sitcom and message are we trying to impart here? All the show seems to do is tease the girl about being pregnant? And don't get me started on the ex-husband and his girlfriend with Reba trying to play go betweeen. How stupid is this??? This show is typical of today's society and its lax morals and standards.
5,Reba,"I love this DVD, Reba is an amazing tv show, great for the whole family. It is defenitly worth the money. Its packed with great bonus features, interviews...commentary."
3,"Entertaining, but nothing special.","I enjoy watching this show. It is a fun show to watch and it is great for the family. I'm just going to cut to the chase...It has good characters and fun story. But REBA does have its shortcomings. There's nothing on REBA that you can't get from another TV show. It's a good show, but not great."
1,SHOWS LIKE THIS ARE WHY I WATCH TVLAND!!,"A show like Reba is why I watch TVLAND or buy DVD sets of true ""Classic"" television like ""I Love Lucy"" or the newly released ""Doris Day Show"". Reba should watch these sitcoms...she might learn something!! Mainly, how not to overact which she miserably does!"
1,THIS SHOW IS NOT FOR ME!,"All things aside, this DVD is great quality with a lot of extras. But it is strictly for McEntire fans. I purchased this collection at a ""yard sale"" for $5.00. I am appalled at what America has come to. Aren't there normal families anywhere anymore? To me this show is not one bit funny. It hurts me to see the wasteland that television has become because of sitcoms that reflect the downward trend society has taken. Sure, it may be about being able to cope in such a society, but how is this society going to change its attitudes and morals if shows like this are telling you its o.k. to live a life of upheaval. Its inspiring to survive in the midst of chaos, but we deal with enough of this in reality. We don't need it thrown in our face on television. It is better to have programs with functional families depicting truth and right in this life, not contention."
1,"SILLY PROGRAM, SILLY PLOTS, BAD ACTING!","This program is silly, vapid and completely nonsensical! I won't let my kids watch it. I don't want them growing up thinking that all families are like this. As for the slapstick moments, Reba needs to stop acting like Lucille Ball. She can't pull it off!"
1,"STAY WITH ""LEAVE IT TO BEAVER""","Give me ""Leave It to Beaver"" any day. ""Reba"" is simply a show to showcase ""McEntire"". The DVD set is handsomely produced but the show itself is quite depressing for me to watch. I prefer not to have ""real life dysfunction"" thrown in my face, not matter how well it is portrayed. Society is thinking that this is the norm....divorce, adultery, teen pregnancy. The previous reviewer wrote this is not ""The Cleavers"". Indeed. But at least when I watch ""The Cleavers"" I get good values and good moral lessons from an era when families were functional. We could have that again were it not for programs like ""Reba"" glamorizing dysfunction in a way that fits the standards of today's society. Needless to say, I didn't buy this DVD set. I rented it because I thought I would get good wholesome comedy. It has its moments but they are few. Reba McEntire needs to quit while she's ahead. Bottom line: this series is not for me. I'll stop now and go watch ""Leave it to Beaver"" reruns!"
5,Reba is Awesome,"This is another of Rebas tv seasons, it is great, so nice to watch her whenever we want to and not just when the show is on tv! Reba Rules!"
5,Definetly the best show The WB has to offer!,This show is totally the BEST show that's ever aired on The WB!
5,Reba Season One,My family and I love this show. We missed a good part of the first season. We love watching it over and over. Can not wait for second season to come out on DVD. Hurry...
1,DON'T THROW IT IN MY FACE!!,"For some incoherent reason I bought this DVD set thinking I would see Reba McEntire in a comedy portraying a decent, moral life. While she may portray a decent, moral person the people around her do not!! I am a child of divorce and I do not relate to this comedy. I find it offensive and appalling. We need television shows out there that will commit to showing us there are still good families out there, functional families with good fathers and mothers (married) teaching their children good morals and values. I am sorry I bought this DVD set. Reba McEntire herself is as arrogant as they get and this excuse is just another attempt to promote herself."
1,REBA SCARES ME!! A Cheesy Program for Cheesy People!,The thought of Reba acting in a sitcom is quite frightening!! Whats worse is the episode after the baby is born and she's holding the baby and the lights dim to focus solely on her and she begins to lip synch (very badly I might add.....its true...watch it and see...) to a song. How cheesy can you get? A cheesy program for cheesy people!!
1,I AM APPALLED!,"I am appalled. Because of the influence of this show, which I allowed my pre-adolescent daughter to buy, she now thinks there is nothing wrong with premarital sex and teenage pregnancy. I had to sit down with her and tell her that its not as cut and dry as it is in this lame sitcom. Not everyone is going to react the way Reba does....inviting the boyfriend to move in with the daughter and make it all fine and dandy with a bow on top. This is the type of impression that this program has made...a bad one."
1,IF YOU FIND DYSFUNCTIONALISM ENDORSED AND APPLAUDED...,"Then this is the program for you. If you want a program that promotes healthy family values then forget this mess, for that is what it is...a dysfunctional mess....like most families today. To me this is not funny. It is sad. And for Miss McEntire to condone this kind of thing just to make herself more known than she is already and richer than she is already is a testament to her true hippocritcal colors!"
1,SHAMEFUL,"I DO NOT OWN THIS DVD BUT I DID WATCH ALL OF SEASON ONE AND PART OF SEASON TWO. THIS SHOW DISGUSTS ME. I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF REBA FOR YEARS (HER MUSIC) BUT THIS SHOW MADE ME ALMOST HATE HER. SHE HAS A TEEN SON, I DOUBT SHE WOULD WANT TO FIND HIM IN THE SITUATION THAT HER TV DAUGHTER AND SON IN LAW FOUND THEMSELVES IN. IT GLAMORIZES TEEN SEX, PREGNANCY, AND MARRIAGE. WHY WAS ADOPTION NEVER MENTIONED AS AN OPTION FOR THESE TWO CHILDREN? AND THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE CHILDREN! THIS SHOW MAKES TEEN PREGNANCY AND MARRIAGE LOOK LIKE A GOOD IDEA INSTEAD OF SHOWING TEENS AND THEIR PARENTS THAT THEIR BEST OPTION IN THIS SITUATION IS ADOPTION, NOT TEEN MARRIAGE AND LIVING WITH MAMA WHILE YOU FINISH HIGHSCHOOL, GO INTO LABOR DURING GRADUATION, AND THEN ATTEND COLLEGE WHILE YOUR INFANT IS STUCK IN DAY CARE ALL DAY. REBA AND ITS CREATORS OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED. I CANNOT FATHOM WHY THIS SHOW HAS LASTED SO LONG."
3,An adequate protection for your dig,"My dog is jet black. Walking her at night she is completely invisible. For safety I wanted something that would lite her up enough to be seen from a distance. The light does a good, but unfortunately the pricey battery doesn't last as log as I'd prefer."
4,Baroque and underappreciated classic,"Odessy and Oracle is as baroque an album your going to find from the 1960's. When it was released in late 68, it was passed over for not being pyschedelic enough. With bands of such fuzzed out mayhem, (Jefferson Airplane, Cream, etc.), ruling the charts, this album fell through the proverbial crack. Rod Argent and Chris White wrote almost as if they were listening through a glass at the door to Lennon and McCartney talking about song ideas. (The above statement could be factual since the album was recorded at Abbey Road.) My personal favorites on this great album are ""Beechwood Park"" and ""Brief Candles"", two very Beatle-esque tunes. The rest of this gem is very lavish and adorned with multiple vocals and tape effects. ""Time of The Season"", their greatest achievement, is also on this album. If this album got the attention it deserved, the Zombies would be among the living."
5,Wonderful pop songs written by your favorite forgotten band!,"This is the best non-beatles 60s album. Everyone has heard ""Time of the Season"", and it,no doubt, is a great classic song but many have not heard this album and their lives are lacking because of it. When I 1st heard ""Care of Cell 44"" it blew me away. It may be just a simple pop song but something about took me by suprise and made it one of those rare music moments one can only hope for once or twice in a lifetime. And from that moment on this album does not disappoint with stunning songs like ""After he's Gone"" and ""Beechwood Park"". This album evokes a psychadelic mood but not a druggy haze like many albums in its day.Its pop finesse allows you to relax and take you on a beautiful pop 'odessey'. I suggest that anyone who considers himself a fan of well written pop-rock pick up this album and discover the forgotten treasure that it is."
3,Odessey & Oracle Falls Short,"I was expecting much more, only a couple of good songs. Maybe a ""best hits"" would be better."
3,"A few good songs, most just OK","I agree with the previous reviewer. This album is really not on the ""lost classic"" scale, in my book. There are a few worthwhile songs: Time Of The Season, of course, is a truly great classic. A couple of other songs are interesting, but nowhere near essential. The rest of the songs...well, yes...they are very wimpy. Imagine The Royal Guardsmen if they decided to sing songs about things other than Snoopy."
2,Not what I hoped for,"Some good music here, but not enough to justify buying this CD. I bought this under the misconception that ""Time of the Season"" and ""She's Not There"" were representative of the rest of the music of The Zombies, but they are not. Unless you're a tried and true Zombies fan I suggest going with a less expensive, concise compilation such as Absolutely The Best. ...ASIN/B00000JMX0..."
3,Overrated. Buy a compilation instead,"With so many people calling this the most underrated album of the 60s it is actually becoming the most overrated album of the 60s.Worth purchasing? Maybe. A decent sized collection of 60s album should contain a zombies song or two.A masterpiece? hardly; It's mostly lightweight filler. (this will annoy the die-hard fans, but it's the truth, so deal with it.)It does contain some nice tunes: ""Hung up on a Dream"", ""Time of the Season"" and ""A Rose for Emily"", but the rest are quite bad, especially ""This will be our year"". And we don't rate an album on 3 songs out of 12, do we?I find myself skipping _every_ song between tracks 6 (Hung up on a Dream) and 12 (Time of the Season). Not a good sign :o)"
3,Uneven brilliance,"3 1/2Undoubtedly good, and insanely influential, the album nevertheless begins to loose steam after an amazing early streak. Although these harmony-driven, intelligently catchy songs do not hold up to the pop brilliance found in a very small minority, O&O; is still well worth it for any fans of late 60's pop-rock."
3,"Not bad, but unfortunately doesn't live up to the hype","While this is a competent album of 3 minute psych pop, when considering all the other greats and unknowns from the era, it seems to me rather overrated. The production is good for the era and the vocal harmonies are impressive, but it's nothing earth-shattering. It's certainly not at the level of the 60s classics from the same period we all know and love, and I can think of plenty of music from relative unknowns from the same year like Andwella's Dream, Aphrodite's Child, Tuesday's Children, Mirage, July, Blossom Toes which I'd take over this. I write this review neither to irritate fans of the album nor to collect brownie points, but rather to warn any prospective buyers not to be swayed by all the positive reviews into automatically thinking this album is a must-have."
4,Better than the Beatles? No Way! Underrated? Way!,"The Zombies were a unique band. Their three hits (She's Not There, Tell Her No, and Time of the Season) were really all of one sort: sad, fierce, keyboard driven, rock anthemns. But Odyssey and Oracle shows a more complex, lyric side that should remind a lot of people of the Beatles and Beach Boys. Definitely worth owning for anyone who values pop music."
5,Immediately their favorite CD,"The first time I played this CD, my three-year-old asked ""can I hear that song again?"" for several tracks. The next time we got in the car, both boys asked for this CD. The next time we were at the library, my six-year-old found the librarian and asked her to help him find other CDs by this band. If you've got a kid that loves going to the aquarium, they will love the CD. The littlest kids (whether they like aquariums or not) will really enjoy ""Butts Up"", a song about how ducks eat."
5,Excellent says it all,"Navy Seals was an excellent action movie, well thought up and directed! This movie also makes a great comedy if you and you best friend watch it drunk!"
4,A favorite of mine !,"Well some people posted that this is a ridiculous movie because it doesn't show the real side of US Armed Forces, i fully disagree with them, this is an action movie, it is intended to entertain the viwers, in my opinion does that and more! When i saw this movie for the first time i didn't even know anything about the Navy Seals. After watching this movie i considered the Navy Seals the n1 Special Force arround the world.For about 120min you will see some awsome action, and you will see a bit of each aspects of a Navy Seal (Sea / Air / Land).Conclusion:If you want an exact documentary about the Navy Seals, try and grab a National Geographic DVD, maby you will find something there of value...Otherwise if you want a very very good entertaining action movie this is it !DVD downsides:It could have a little bit more of extras... No extras at all!If it wasn't for that i would give it a full 5 star score!"
2,Top Gun With Flippers,"Good set dressing, locations and effects, but if you think you've seen this movie before, you have. It was called Top Gun. Lots of explosions and characters running here and there, but little else. I gave it two stars instead of just one since the camera did stay in focus throughout."
4,Navy Seals,In my opinion not the best Navy Seal DVD out there but still a very good set of DVDs about the Seals. Good explanation about some of the weapons and vehicles used by the seals today and lots of actions of seals in training. Well worth it.
5,Navy Seals (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray,Lots of action thats has on this movie Navy Seals (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-rayVery good! Good movie of charlee sheen!
3,Navy Seals,Purchased for 7.1 surround sound rating but did not notice any special surround sound features. Average movie....typical Charlie Sheen.
5,navy seals better than it came out in 1991,"this film is one of my best action movies out there since i saw the release of blu-ray 5.1 dts sound.sine i saw windtalkers, blackhawk down, the kingdom home town of binladen, september 8 tapes, the traitor, mission accomplished, on blu-ray 5 stars more of the sounds, better quality and picture and uncut, than the original on regular dvd, by 2pac"
1,Absurd in the light of reality,"Sixteen years after this was made, it is sort of amusing to see what ""someone in Hollywood"" thought would be a great morale booster in terms of displaying our military capabilities. Now that we know the reality of the situation of dealing with terrorists abroad, the flimsy premises of this tawdry little film seem even more ridiculous. But - at its core - it was an idiotic film then, and an even more idiotic film now."
1,It's an insult - if it wasn't so darn ridiculous,"The movie is so dumb, I can't help but wonder how many Navy Seals felt insulted after seeing it. Maybe it is a cool thing for 12 year olds, I am sure they too want to be able to ""sense"" a door being locked or having a terrorist behind it just by placing your fingertips on it (did Sheen come up with that one himself??). At no point in the movie did they even look as the professionals they ought to be. At no point did the movie make any sense, or did the story entail any real intrigue or purpose. Perhaps the Beirut scenes make up for some of the idiotic and lame ""acting"" Sheen throws at you, but overal, I cannot help but feeling that this movie does more harm than good to the image and prestige of the US Navy's finest. Waste of money - waste of time."
1,"I'm no Charlie Sheen fan, but he deserved better than this","1990 wasn't a good year for Charlie Sheen. As if ""Navy Seals"" wasn't bad enough, he followed it with ""The Rookie"", another brainless action flick that both he and director/co-star Clint Eastwood would like to forget. But of the two, I'd have to say that ""Navy Seals"" is worse. Overflowing with cornball dialogue, stupid action scenes and MTV filler (remember that golf-cart chase set to music?), this movie was made for a twelve-year-old. Watch ""Black Hawk Down"" and see how a real modern war film sould be made."
1,An insult to the real Navy Seals,"With its comic book plot and cardboard characters this movie does an injustice to the men it takes as its inspiration. Any real world Seal acting as irresponsibly as the Sheen character would not long survive the wrath of his teammates. Yes, its just a movie, but what a shame that the image of real world heros is portrayed by idiot Rambos with swim fins."
4,misinformed viewers,"I have read many reviews that have been compared to the ""real"" SEALs.I would agree, there are some parts about the film that seem unbelievable. However, if you are going to do enough research into the SEAL teams to ""know"" this movie is unrealistic, here is an idea for you. Research a navy SEAL team called Red Cell. After reading about it, you will agree that this movie is almost exactly to a tee on how that team operated. Keep that in mind next time you watch the film."
1,Military Channel documentary DVD,"Although assured by the Military Channel and Discovery Channel that this DVD was the program I was looking to purchase (program aired on Military Channel as ""Secrets of the Navy Seals""), this was not the correct program and a complete waste of my money."
2,Good for the hard of hearing.,"I have had these for years. I put one next to me at my hearing level. Thus my husband can listen to TV more quietly. For me it is mostly for TV, some music, and occasional movies. It does cut out on some of the old movies -- in the quiet places. There may be better ones out there, but these work for me. Another thing I like is putting them in the kitchen and listening to the news while I am making dinner or doing dishes. It is much clearer then the TV speakers..."
4,You people are crazy.,"This album is great. I do think that the self titled is a little better, but this is great none the less. Billy's vocals are so fitting for the style, I couldn't picture anyone else singing these songs. Listen to the song ""JANE DOE"". NOWGreg xxx"
1,Black Halos are Horrible,"This CD is very bad. I didn't find any of the songs unique or enthralling. I gave it a few listens, but the Vocals are annoying and harsh and the music is very repetitive. A smart move would be to find a new singer. I suppose this band is influenced by the New York Dolls and Stiv Bators, but Johnny and Stiv would not be impressed. Don't quit your day jobs Black Halos!"
2,compilation disappointing and little interesting,"I believed that this dvd was seen rare video, but I found instead many no famous artists and all ugly video.the quality of this video is poor and the music is with many ustles"
5,Solid,This bench is very sturdy and built well. My old bench was a rickety death trap and this replacement was worth every penny.
4,More fun not pay to play,Have played the Guild Wars series aince it started 5 years ago.I own them all and have given many as gifts to others who in turn have brought more new players into a game series where once you buy the game; there is no more cost to play. No monthly fees and lot's of new content being added as the games get older. Now I wait for the new Guild Wars 2 to come out and will play it along with my older favorites in this series.Try them; I am sure you will like them all.Amazon has always been great in getting me all my purchases promptly and they have dealers who go far above the normal call of duty to get them where they belong; when they belong there.
1,Guild wars game,i was not to happy with this i got installed it and it ask for a serial code with did not come with it i was so mad. i wrote the people who made the game to give the serial code but they didn't they were pissing me off by sending me stupid e-mails like we need more informing and gave them all i had. so do u this is is good?
5,sublime,"I've read my fair share of biographies about writers- everyone from Theodore Dreiser to Jean Rhys to the Brontes and Edith Wharton to Hans Christian Anderson- just to name a few. From the obscure to the iconic. This of course is a bio of an iconic writer, but it is not for that reason that it tops my list. I don't know what exactly the magic of this bio is- the author's exhaustive, encyclopedic knowledge of Fitzgerald, his obvious love for his subject, or the magic of Fitzgerald himself. A mixture of all three, probably. If you have any interest in F. Scott, this is the book for you. A page turner that will break your heart."
3,exhaustive bio,"Bruccoli definitely knows his stuff. But his writing reminds me of a grad school teacher I had who was too close to his obsession to teach the material in a very interesting way at all. If you're looking for a bio that has all the minutia of FSF's life, this is it. If you're looking for a compelling and selective narrative, not so much. I found myself skipping through the 500+ pages to get to what I wanted/needed."
5,some sort of epic ;life of f.scott fitzgerald,"very good ,yes,i would recommend the book ! It is a storyabout f.scott fitzgerald . Very interesting indeed !"
3,Average,This book is useful for very basic knowledge but even in my introductory proposal writing class I needed to go elsewhere to find more or more detailed information.
4,A short but sweet country workout,"If you get past the silly costumes, you will find a solid 35 min. step workout that includes a brief warm-up, cardio, and cool down. Ruth explains all moves well in the beginning of the tape. Her instructions throughout the tape are also clear. As an in-shape person who is new at step, I enjoy this workout. The soundtract is also very good and consists of upbeat country favorites. The only thing I really don't like is that the workout only lasts 35 min. But I guess for some people that is a perfect time. All in all, this is a good buy."
4,very nice,"this book has every song off of weezer's self-titled album.it has every guitar partwritten out in tab and standard notation,along with the lyrics,even the backing vocals.the only way this book could've been better would be if the basslines were included.however,since matt basically follows the rhythym guitar,which is listed,you can follow that and figure it out,which is a good opportunity to practice your ear training.all in all,this was a very good book.i would like to see one for their second album,pinkerton."
4,One problem that might bug some people,The only thing that bugged me about this was that the tabs were not a half-step down which is the traditional Weezer tuning I was used to from blue and pink. Now if I have to tune up if I want to play along with the album but otherwise its all good.
4,Weezer is the tightest band ever!,Weezer music is fun to play and sing to and this book shows you how! Get the book and your cool distortion and your set. =w=w=w=w=w=
3,ITS GUITAR MUSIC,"Okay I got caught up in the change that it might be a fan book, or something information wise about the band. Its just the music for the blue album and some pictures. I don't play guitar, but its kind of fun to try it out on piano. If you want guitar music, its good, if you didn't, then don't buy it. I don't really regret it, cause it is true, if you are a real weezer fan you'll have this."
5,Be Inspired,"I came across George Dyer singing on an FM station about 3yrs ago singing 'All Creatures of Our God & King. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. His renditions on this CD of some really well known religeous songs/hymns is wonderful and he has quite a very fresh approach to these songs. Two of my favourites on this CD are, I Walked Today Where Jesus Walked and All Creatures of Our God & King. They are both treated with the reverence & respect we have come to expect from this wonderful artist. This is a very thought provoking album."
3,disappointing,"This was somewhat disappointing. I love all of Lynn's novels, but this one was missing some of the heart-felt romance. I am not sure why. It was good, just not as good as her other books. Still worth buying though."
5,Much Ado in the Moonlight,This is a series of books on the extended family of her stories. Each book can stand alone but I collect them all so I can read them as each one happens. Wonderful books.
4,Not Bad,"I know David Quinn may have been dissapointed by this one, but you can only do so much before the movie is rated X I can't wait to see what they do with Faust 2."
3,More icky fun from the producer of RE-ANIMATOR,"Uneven but entertaining update of the Faustian legend based on the comic book is like a horrific hybrid of SPAWN and THE CROW. After his girlfriend is murderered John Jaspers (Mark Frost) strikes up a bargain with a cult leader named M (Andrew Divoff from WISHMASTER) who offers him the opportunity to exact vengeance in exhange for his soul. Jaspers returns as a devil-like creature to raise hell on the creeps who killed his soulmate.FAUST is full of the gooey FX you'd expect from a Brian Yuzna film (The melting woman is a special highlight among other things). Features the memorable line from Jaspers' alter ego: ""Help me? Help you ya mean! I'm the pornography that gets you hot!"". The full title onscreen is FAUST: LOVE OF THE DAMNED."
2,flop,"The movie Faust tries to follow in the foot steps of Spawn? Save your money! If you must see it, be warned: the acting is lousy. However, it does have its great action moments."
1,"Please, Just shoooooooooot me","i am so disgusted with this movie, that i was almost in tears after i saw it. it includes Horrible sex and nudity scenes(including child molestation/rape), pervasive blood/gore and violence, language, and disturbing images.overall i would pay money just to rewind life and not watch this.WARNING- if you so choose to watch this, nightmares and disturbing thoughts are almost insured."
1,"Yes, it's bad...but the comic book is MUCH better!","Yes, it's true: this movie is terribly made. And like most everyone else here is saying, I agree that it's not worth watching or renting. Even reading the comic book before seeing this movie doesn't help, because it's so far removed from the book that it's insulting.I can understand that in an hour and a half film it's not possible to capture the entire comic book (it would really take a mini-series to do it properly or at least a 2-hour epic with a Frank Miller (""Sin City"", ""300"") budget), but they did things that weren't even in the comic book; things that make the comic book so great.I definitely wouldn't use this movie to judge the comic book. Everyone who was disappointed with the film should search out the collected trade paperbacks of the Faust comic book series to see how great Faust: Love of the Damned truely is."
4,"after all, it's a Yuzna!","don't be fooled: this little masterpiece from the guy who brought you ""Bride of Re-Animator"" is one of the best comic movies. forget ""Spawn""!"
3,could do with more blood,this is not a bad film it could have just done with alittle more action and blood.the box does not give any rating info but from the look of things i would say its unrated?the main faust character looks a bit cheesy in his red costume and to be honest looks better in his in-between stages.brian has done a pretty good job with this film considering its low budget.if you enjoy a bit ofdark blood thirsty comic style vilence then buy this
3,Faust: Love of the Damned,"I wanted this movie to be so much more than it was. Having read the comic series from Quinn & Vigil for Rebel Graphics, which was incredibly graphic (violence, gore, sex) bordering on pornographic, I was actually stunned to see a movie adaptation, and only R-rated!!! Tim Vigil did write the screen play so I can at least give props for the storyline, however, true to form, the comic books are so much better than the movie. But it is a thoroughly enjoyable romp, plenty of sex, dismemberment and mayhem (even a little BDSM). If your easily shocked or squeamish, DON'T WATCH THIS. If you haven't read the comics and like a little kink with your shock, you'll love this adaptation. But to really enjoy Faust...get the comic books."
1,Damned bad.,"This flick fails in every aspect. The plot is jibberish. The acting non-existant. The special effects laughable. The action still-lifed. Ranks up there with CAPTAIN AMERICA for worst comic book movie of all time. DAREDEVIL was better than this mess, and that's saying a lot. If you enjoy good comic book films (even the smaller, independant type), avoid this tripe at all costs. If you like the darker, more violent heroes watch the excellent BLADE again and revell in the fact that good, bloody horror/action films still need writitng and acting to entertain. FAUST: LOVE OF THE DAMNED is so damned bad it qualifies as anti-entertainment."
1,waste of time,"the other reviewers who saw this as a flop are right. Brian Yuzna cannot come close to his earlier efforts(Ew-Animator and Bride of RA). Horror movies have gone to the dogs, and it's sad that there is no more ceativity in this genre. This movie has bad acting, pails of gore, and an anti super hero that looks like something dug up from Inframan. Combs is wasted. His role adds nothing to the stupid plot. I wasted my money."
2,Faust:Love Of The Damned,"Faust was not that good of a horror/gore movie.Lots of gore but man there is some bad acting in this by the lead actor Mark Frost.I believe they should have gave the lead to Jeffrey Combs.The suit for the Hero looked like a power ranger villain's costume.If you are a die hard fan of the Faust comic book's see it,this movie is based on the first few comic book's they made but if you are a horror fan looking for a scare you will find yourself snoozing."
1,What a Joke,"Altho Re-Animator and a few others were good, this is a horrorible what-should-have-been a late 80's low to no budget UP! All Night!! late night showtime aw-trocity. Screaming Mad George is THEE worst FX guy on the planet. Stan Winston wouldn't wipe his a$$ with this tard. Brian Yuzna the new Ed Wood or Roger Corman has ruined multiple projects in his way-too-long to have a career by now get over Return of the Living Dead 3 wish we could have afforded CGI then you loser. Yeah maybe if this were a 1986 production a la Night of the Creeps but jeez this is so boring stiff and miscast even Jeffrey Combs couldn't begin to save it.Overall I suffered more watching this than when my (ex)girlfriend made me watch Blue Crush.I can't even give this a A for effort--Just like the Spider-Man movies-did you actually read the comics before you assumed command???"
1,Faust: Love of the Sellout,"First, this movie gets one star ONLY because I can't seem to rate it zero stars. Second, let's correct all the self-righteous fools in some of the other reviews...Quinn and Vigil created the Faust comic series LONG before Todd McSellout created Spawn. That being said, the character's appearance is clearly a rip-off of Marvel's Wolverine (created in the 70s). Now for the film...well, there is nothing to really say...it sucks. It very well could be the worst film ever made. Nope, no exaggeration, it could be THE WORST. It is a TRUE SHAME that this schlock will be forever paired with what was one of the best, most brutal comic book series' ever produced (however, it too even went through a couple different distributors before the series was completed YEARS behind schedule). Oh, sorry, back to the film...it SUCKS. Don't waste your money...PLEASE...don't waste your time."
1,"Don't buy it, don't hire it, don't watch it !","I didn't read the comic that inspired this stuff(Sorry can't call this A MOVIE !) but I am a truly fan of the Old Horror genre. Reanimator rules ! ;) Regarding FAUST, you get the worst acting, the direction, the worst production.The bad guy is ridiculous and it's even not funny ! I guess the Comic is better than this mediocrity, anyway can't be worst.So do not be influenced by the label on the cover saying ""From the producer of Re-Animator"" You will be disappointed. Even if you can watch it for free, don't waste your time !"
1,Absolute Junk,"Absolute junk. once you get the drive installed (for which there are no instructions - the instruction booklet only tells you how to install the drivers for various operating systems that no one has anymore), it is VERY difficult to get the computer to recognize it subsequent times. I had to reboot several times each time I want to see my data."
1,Cheap Quality,Plug separated from the cable during first installation. Item went straight to the trash.
1,Wrong title AX32T is the IAT Sensor (Intake Air Temp),Wrong title AX32T is the IAT Sensor (Intake Air Temp)Wrong title AX32T is the IAT Sensor (Intake Air Temp)
2,Don't be confused by the title of this book,Don't be confused by the title of this book; because this book was NOT Too Hot To Handle. This book seemed to focus wayyy too much on the women scorned and very little on the relationship between Jenny and Jared. I do not think the relationship was given time to develop. I have read the first three books in this series and I think the best one was the very first one. The rest I wish I could get my money back for.
4,Great book on domestic violence,"Although this book is somewhat dated and things are better now than they were in the 1970s, it is still a great source about domestic violence in the US. Martin has done a great job with a sensitive subject and her writing is very powerful."
3,An actionless romantic western,"If you're willing to suspend your disbelief and believe that Amish women are smoldering with lust and ready to throw aside their beliefs and go at it like Pam Anderson, then you might like this film. The box makes it look like it's gonna be one wild action western. Unfortunately, it was based on a romance novel and you can tell. There are maybe five minutes of action in the film. A cattle baron is trying to run folks off his land with a group of men. However, when the final showdown occurs, only 3 men show up to face Tim Daly. As you might expect this doesn't make for a very action-packed piece. If you're more into character-driven stories though, you will probably like it. Yes, it's nice to see Daly's character change from the killer to the father-figure. It's just hard to picture Naomi Watts as a lusty Amish woman. She does a great job acting, but it seems hard to believe she'd throw away all she believed in just for a few minutes of passion."
2,Skip it.,Just watch Shane if you want a Western or Witness if you want a movie about the Amish. There are too many better movies to waste your time on this mediocre one.
4,Great story line,"We enjoyed this movie; the story line is very good, acting is well done.Recommend it highly."
4,I watched it last night and I loved it.,"I read the book ""The Outsider"" by Penelope Williamson about a year ago. I loved it, but didn't realize a Showtime movie had been made until I got info from Amazon. I ordered the movie, but was afraid it wouldn't be any good. I wasn't sure that Tim Daly could pull off the leading role (having known him from the show ""Wings,"" where he was hilarious, but not necessarily someone who could be a convincing gunslinger). Well he proved me wrong. The movie was GREAT... the scenery was breathtaking and the chemistry between the two main characters (Daly and Naomi Watts) was palpable... I would recommend this highly, especially for those who read and liked the book."
5,The Outsider,Excellent video. The acting and setting are superior and the story moves quickly while maintaining the viewer's interest.
4,The Outsider,"Really enjoyed this updated version of John Wayne's old movie, The Angel and the Bad Man.' Tim Daly is awesome. Some great, almost haunting music."
5,divine,This movie is divine. I challenge everyone to buy it if you love westerns!It is historically correct in every way. I want hollywood or whoever to make more like it! I love Tim Daly and Naomi Watts. I have always loved the Carridine men. I grew up watching them and their father John Carridine. The characters were great and the stars were perfect for the parts! Enjoy the movie! Melissa Frix
5,great on so many levels - so much to savor,"I just had to own this movie. So many beautiful, touching moments. Great acting by the two leads. I LOVED Tim Daly in this, and Naomi Watts was so likeable and luminous. Beautiful setting, and breathtaking music that added to my favorite scenes. I loved the way the chemistry between Tim and Naomi was palpable. I know I'm only repeating what others have said, so won't list my favorite scenes, but let me add that attention to small details, long looks, facial expressions, meaningful dialog, made this movie wonderful. Those who've seen the movie will know what I'm talking about. I could go on and on. I just can't get enough of it. Very high on the list of my favorite movies."
3,Not as good as the book (3 1/2 stars),"I read ""the Outsider"" a while ago. The movie was surprisingly good, but not as richly detailed or as well developed as the book... but then thats usually the case with a book turned movie. I enjoyed Naomi Watts in her role as Rebecca(Rachel in the book) and I would have probably have rated it higher than 3 1/2 stars if I had not read it first. All in all, this was a movie worth seeing."
3,Not for television audiences,I saw this on TV and thought it was a very well written love story where an Amish woman falls for a gunslinger that gets shot. She doctors him back to health and her kind ways transform his life. The biggest problem with this movie other than the premarital sex is that if you order it in DVD it has nudity. It shows her breasts. It was so long ago when I saw it on TV that I don't remember much about the violence though I don't think there is a lot and Of course it had no language I'm not sure but I don't think there's any on the DVD either.
2,not what I expected,"I started watching this movie on TV and thought I'd like to see all of it, but wasn't able to see all of it. I love westerns, but to me the sex was a little over the top. I could see the passion building between the two of them so for me there really wasn't a need to be smacked in the face with the sex scene. Too bad, it kind of spoiled the film for me."
5,Outsider,"In a made for t.v Western this movies is very well done. I first saw it on the Hallmark Channel. When I found it on DVD I bought it because it was a must. If you like stories about life and religious freedom, this ones for you."
5,great movie,"The Outsider is a very good movie.. action, romance, and Tim Daly is extremly hot in this movie!"
4,The Amity Affliction,"The first time i heard The Amity Affliction was at a parkway drive, and everytime i die tour, they opened and were kickass, the intstruments were crisp and the screamin was awsome. This album i reccomend if you are a fan of ParkwayDrive, I killed the promqueen or any Aussie hardcore band.Stay (sic)"
3,All around good book,"How to Stop Time is a compeling collection of personal experience with the drug heroin. It is a collection of experience mostly as a buyer, but also as a dealer, for the short time that she was one. The first half of the book is slightly controversial in that it portrays the drug as a good thing. She also loses some credability by contradicting herself in a few instances, but usually remains true to her word. In the end however, she redeems herself a turns to focus more on the drugs true problems and looks at the facts. It is a book worth reading."
1,"Initially gripping, but interest wanes....a tad pretentious","Some interesting characters, though I'm afraid she's not one of them. Way too much meandering into her past, her upbringing, her yawn-inducing armchair self-analysis... and as it turns out she never even used a needle, and was more of an occasional trust-fund-endowed snorter.... not that that should disqualify her from writing a book, but I don't think she's quite the authority she tries to pass herself off as. Heroin from A to C, perhaps."
3,Anticlimatic...unenlightening,"Ann Marlowe is a cleaver writer who has *constructed*, rather than written a not so cleaver book on addiction. Or has she even done that? We see her addiction to the cool, more-hip-than-thou scene of the East Village, certainly a taste for the drug and descriptions of those whose lives were truly ruled by it, but little of her own heart. It may have been more fulfilling if she could have demonstrated how she lost it due to her own disconection, isolation and selfishness of her use, but I suspect she didn't have it in her to begin with.Users can - and do! - recover. One doesn't even need to subscribe to the NA model of addiction to see that. She hints at the end that her realization that life was going on without her, and that desire to be a part of it lead her to stop heroin. While her take on personal responsibility for her use is admirable, her denial of any grip on her life past her use is questionable."
2,A Dilettante's Guide to Snorting Heroin,"I wholeheartedly support anyone's right to share her experience with heroin. But to act as if your experience with heroin is somehow definitive is quite arrogant and dangerous. Luckily for Marlowe, she managed a fairly recreational heroin habit. Problematically, she judges those who have much more serious habits. Hmmm...Perhaps others are more prone to addiction? She grew up economically priveleged. Should she really be so judgemental?Surprisingly, the book hasn't aged so well -- the prose style is not that compelling, although there are moments of lucidity and intelligence. Yet it is not highly readable."
3,how to stop time,"How to stop time is a pretty good addition to the annals of addiction lit. Ms. Marlowe conveys a lot of the bright side of narcotics abuse, and doesn't resort to the gritty documentary-verite style so common to the genre. She works in a format (the A-Z list) that makes this a good read, even if you just crack the book open to random pages, and her acute social commentary mostly hits it's mark. Fans of the more gritty heroin journals might be better off seeking the work of Susan Lydon, Scott Frank, or Luke Davies, but for an entertaining read, How To Stop Time is commendable."
2,s-see spare me!,"This book started off by promising an interesting slightly psychoanalytical approach to addiction. But by the middle (h-see home) you could predicate that she would end up (u-see underground), `discussing, me, me, me, and how now-a-days the underground scene is not really underground and TV is boring pop culture for those who refuse to take themselves too seriously (t-try it!). Well I'm also around 40 and was cool in my day but really what do we 40 yr olds know about the 'real' underground scene today. I remember the few 40 yr olds that hung around the scene when I was cool and now I know just how boring it would be to be 40 in an underground scene. Girl grow up! Finish your therapy (p-see psychoanalysis) and go back to Wall Street. If you want to deconstruct heroin addiction at least read Derrida or something, you can't just make it up based on your dad's incest problem and Parkinson disease, they were his issues!"
4,Trainspotting in Wallstreet,"Going in alphabetical format, Anne Marlow, a Jewish Harvard grad, then Wall Street Analyst, recounts her encounter with heroin weaving little narratives into cool, copping, drug...etc. So why is it good? Cause it's about drugs and shows that with some smarts and income you can hide a habit quite nicely; also Anne is very candid about her experience; which is probably why it's not so good, she comes across as somewhat affected, uber kool, and intelligent, but not particularly pleasant, and you'd image that if you sat next to her at a party, you come away exhausted with Anne having had a sharper point / opinion on everything, which is probably why she took heroin, the hardest drug of the all, you can't beat that. Either way, I did enjoy this book, and for those among you that love reading about junkies, prostitutes, after hours clubs, this is one for the collection."
1,Untrue,"It may seem incredible, but this book actually gave me the encouragement needed to experiment with the drug. Heck, I didn't know you can sniff it. And, according to the author, it's not very dangerous. Quitting entails little more than the equivalent of a really bad case of the flu.I tried it. It's not as she describes. Not at all. It's been a while since I read it, and I must admit, I remember very little about it. Which speaks more to its content than to my memory. Very little humanity, heart, all the good stuff we're looking for in books, art, and life. I actually do feel sorry for the author. In any event, readers she be aware that her portrayal of heroine use is quite inaccurate and misleading. I speak from experience."
1,A Joke Of A Book! Heroin Kills!,"Ann Marlowe does some serious damage with this kind of ""Heroin Chic"" Writing. Come to find out she never stuck a needle in her arm. For every one Ann Marlowe there is A thousand heroin addicts who will lead lives of dispare, torture and ultimately death. Opiates are hugely addicting and Her writing reminds me of Vincent Vega (John Travolta's Pulp Fiction Role). We see Vega Shooting up heroin and then cruising down the street with a huge smile on his face. Makes it look quite cool. I cannot tell you the countless lives I have seen ruined by this vicious drug. ANY writing that sheds a positive (Or in Marlowes case, A manageable) light on Heroin use is sad. Simply sad. I pity her."
4,ann marlowes heroin book,"ive read this book, but more importantly lived this craziness and will attest to the accuracy of her observations. as i read some of the passages i could actually taste the taste and started to sniffle,my nose began to run. it scared the hell out of me. i wish i could say that life style was behind me,but anyone who has done heroin will admit you never stop wanting it,that you sometimes still dream about it,and know intimately the situations you put yourself in. Jim Michaels"
2,Not the Best,"I'm sorry but I'm dissappointed with this video. The album Come On Over is played out. It's been two years since she released it and its about time we heard something new from her. The video has all her videos you can pretty much see on CMT anytime you like. There are also two videos (Come on Over & Honey I'm Home) which only show her in concent. A complete waste of time. If you want to watch quality made videos, do not buy this tape, instead watch Faith Hill on CMT!"
3,"you're a phony, shania twain","When are people going to realize that while Shania may look good and sing fairly well, she does not possess the writing talent, intelligence, and skills she herself claims to possess. Her reclusive and modest husband is the talent behind Shania's success. He's happy enough to put her in the limelight, and she's thankful that she can use him to fool the public. You'll notice that on her first CD, Beginnings, produced in 1989, she had to hire a songwriter because she had NO GOOD SONGS (not that the songs they used were necessarily good.) A real songwriting talent would have a catalog of good material just bursting to be heard. While in Nashville she found it difficult to partake in the traditional songwriting sessions. Hmmm...could it be that she didn't measure up?"
4,ANYTHING HER IS GREAT.,"This talented performer from up north keeps getting better and better. She's in touch with us as her delivery is salted with both a sly humor, and a dignified zeal. Twain fends away iconoclasm as she limits public guest appearences to a minimum, and has never editorialized in her recordings. For all that is said of her beauty, the ridiculous rumors, and her navel, she is a clear vocal talent who can sing at my next wedding ANYTIME!"
5,Excellent Shania movie video ~ Great Gift Idea!,"Love this video ~ (probably not as much as my husband does) ;/ However, it is well worth watching over and over again.. very entertaining, and nice excerpts. Fast shipping, great price and gift idea."
4,Go get this album!!,"I was very pleased with this album. This is definitely a booty-shaker!Love it, Love it! Do your thing kay gee!"
4,Hot CD!,Where in the world is Koffee Brown?? This album has been slept on by many and I am guilty for that myself. This album is tight as I dont know what. Very talented couple. Did they end their career of artists early? Get dropped from their record label? Where is Koffee Brown??
3,Party Central,"Good uplifting party tracks. Nothing to differentiate this album from any other of 1000 R&B releases, just solid delivery and decent beats. Reminds me a lot of the feeling you get when listening to the old Zhane. Nothing special, just background music on the way to the club. I'm sure you can get 500,000 sales from a formulaic release these days, just look at all the boy/girl bands out there with no talent. This is the same thing, but in an R&B shell. If you want music, listen to an artist (Angie Stone, Alicia Keys, Brian McKnight, Maxwell). If you want pop, here you go."
5,Da Bomb,This CD is the bomb. Koffee Brown CD is off the hook. I can't stop listening to it. I hope they continue to make music like this in the near future. They are keeping it real. Keep doing your thing.. NY one luv.
4,Wake Up And Smell The Koffee,"This has to be one of the best rnb albums of 2001 yet. The songs, the skits, and both artists can sing. This album is by far better than the male/female trio City Highs debute self titled album. With guest appearances with up and coming rapper Midwikid on the duo's second single ""Weekend Thing"" which is a hot summer anthem and Lady Luck blazes on the song ""BlackOut"" where she puts Destiny's Child lead vocalist Beyonce' in her place. Also you hear a solo from Vee on the song"" All Those Fancy Things"". The album also features the first blazin single ""After Party"" and closes with the beautiful ""Do U See"". This album is a must have for true rnb fans."
4,"The best ""Koffee"" I had in a while.","I just picked up the new Koffee Brown after listening to most of the cuts on the best internet station on the net... I have to say, this CD is on point. ""Afterparty"" is not the only hit off of this CD! You should be hearing this CD throughout the year. From party grooves such as ""Weekend Thing"" and the current single to straight up ghetto hymms such as ""Fingerpointing"" and ""hater's disease,"" this CD is a keeper. A very promising debut. It makes me wonder how an Alexander'O Neal/Cherelle CD would have sounded. hmmm."
5,GREAT BOOK,"I won't even attempt to sound as smart as the other reviewers. After reading this book, I feel like I know the Prophet. I am thankful for his courage and for his bringing about the Church of Jesus Christ and everything that goes with it. As for those who don't find this book inspiring...maybe we didn't read the same book. I found it completely inspirational and satisfying. A question I have for the scholar who disapproves of the book: Is this an error filled book? It seemed pretty well sourced. I am no scholar, but what I do know is this: It's good to know that such a magnificent work was brought about by a regular person, albeit a person chosen of god. What's wrong with admitting faults and weaknesses? We all have them; the key is knowing who you are, striving to do what's right, and having faith in the Saviour to make up the difference."
5,The best biography on Joseph Smith I have read,"I am not going to attempt an in-depth review of this excellent book. Suffice to say that I feel this work to be the most informative and insightful biography on Joseph Smith and the founding of Mormonism that I have read: and I have read well over half a dozen major works on Joseph Smith, including all of his published writings. Bushman has covered the lot: the nature of revelations claimed by Joseph Smith; his growing vision as a religion maker; his weaknesses and mistakes; and his final moves that resulted in his death. The focus on the cultural setting is invaluable, in my opinion, in placing Joseph Smith in his world. Mormons back then were not very much like Mormons today in many fundamental ways. The successful emergence of Mormonism was as much a matter of timing and location as it was the work of Joseph Smith."
2,Good history; Poor biography,"Historian Richard Bushman has written a detailed, objective account of Joseph Smith and his times. But to what end? Can any history of a person claiming direct communication with the Divine be ""objective""? Indeed, should it? The revelatory experiences Joseph Smith claimed to have had either happened or they did not. If Joseph's accounts were true, of what relevance is it that other individuals in his age also claimed revelations? If God actually instructed Joseph Smith to engage in polygamy, of what relevance is it other charismatic leaders were preaching free love? If Joseph Smith or his associates somehow concocted volumes of fake scripture, it is of no more importance to me than Mark Hoffman's works -- interesting, but worthless.Richard Bushman tells an interesting -- perhaps even excellent -- history of the man Joseph Smith and his times. Unfortunately, his is not an especially useful approach for understanding the character and calling of a prophet of God."
4,Very informative,"A very informative, enlightening book on Mormon history and it's founder. Really gives you a new perspective of Joseph Smith. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a better understanding of a ""more real"" Mormon history than the somewhat watered down version that most are aware of."
5,Fascinating read,"I'm only about 1/4 through it, but I'm already prepared to call this one of my favorite LDS books. The unique perspective it offers on the most critical figure in my faith (outside of Christ of course) is so refreshing. Considered with all of his warts, Joseph becomes so much more real, and so much more accessible. I'm almost convinced that all the curious aspects of Joseph that I've had a hard time understanding can be clarified by looking more closely at events and circumstances that have been glossed over in other histories. There's humor, richness of detail, and insights on practically every page."
4,Rough Stone Rolling,An honest review of Joseph Smith's life and the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.
1,Leaves out important issues in order to protect Smith's reputation.,"This biography is not much more than a well-written hagiography which does its best to present Joseph Smith in an imperfect but good-looking light trying to protect his reputation. It ignores significant events that would be of interest to readers. He leaves the Kinderhook Plates out of his chronology, his misdemeanor conviction of 'glass-looking,' his affair with Fanny Alger, his marriage to Lucinda Harris, etc."
5,Shows both sides of this religious leader,"Excellent book. I have read it in its entirety. It tells the story of a human being, with all the foibles and weaknesses that entails, who was learning to lead people in religion.The wise reader will be able to tell this is a far more even-handed and objective study of Smith's background than books such as F. Brodie's ""No man knows my history"" and those books with sensational titles that were written more just to get us to buy them than to to present research as objectively as possible.If you want to know the good and negative to Smith's background in tremendous detail (the book is thick), this is the book to read. If you want to read something that supports what you have already concluded, positive or negative, you'll want to choose some other book."
5,Great book about the mormon prophet,"This a wonderfully informative book about the character of the Mormon ProphetJoseph Smith. If you have ever wondered who this Joe Smith is, this book help greatly increase you knowledge of him."
2,Left me wanting answers.,"This book did not answer the questions I have about the criminal convictions against Joseph Smith that occurred before the Book of Mormon, etc. The book was a good review of the polygamy evidence, the Missouri and Nauvoo history and the Smith family. However, I did not have remaining questions concerning those topics. Does someone know of a book written by an LDS (not former LDS) that addresses the convictions going back to New York?"
4,"Terrific Historial Background, but not for a new/weak Member","This book is likely the most comprehensive biography produced about the life of Joseph Smith. Bushman was able to appropriately balance the references to both criticism and praise. He added insights to the topic of polygamy that I've not found anywhere - actually helping me to understand why. However, the blunt description of events and teachings makes me feel that this is not a book to be read by someone trying to stregthen their testimony of the prophet. I would not want to share this with a new member or someone investigating.He all but calls Joseph Sr. a drunk who early on gave up his role as provider for the family. He also spends a lot of time describing Joseph's treasure-seeking days, which, while true, doesn't help to strengthen the weak of heart.For the firmly established member of the church with a deep understanding of LDS history, this is a fascinating read that will endear you to Joseph Smith."
3,"Sounded Great, but Not Working Now","I installed this in my trunk with a Kicker Amp on April 10th and it sounded great, May 10th it isn't working and now and I can't return it (10days after the Return Policy), so if you have trouble with yours, good luck..."
5,"Wow, what a difference!","When I restored my 1967 Camaro, I installed an Alpine MRP-F300 four channel amplifier along with Infinity Kappa 692.9i speakers in the rear package tray and Infinity Kappa 462.9cfp speakers in the kick panels. The sound was 1000% better than it had ever been in the 45 year old car. But it wasn’t really good enough. So I recently pulled the amplifier and replaced it with an Alpine MRX-V70 amplifier that also has a subwoofer channel. I was struggling with how to install a fixed subwoofer in the Camaro and finally decided to simply place an 8” Bazooka BT8014 tube in the floor space of the backseat area (no one ever rides in the back seat anyway!).The sound difference is amazing and rivals the high-end factory JBL system in my wife’s Toyota Highlander! I couldn’t be more pleased with the results."
4,tony in texas,"Upon purchase and recieving item, i was pleased arrived quickly with no probs, ive owned bazooka tubes before like in the 90,s this one seems to be made with similar quality, im sure i will be pleased after hooking it up, wich i havnt done yet. i bought the rockford fosgate r 250 prime series amplifier to power this tube, i hope it isnt over powered im sure it will be tested completly using this power source. so will see if bazooka has made any improvements soon enough. i LIKE BAZOOKA TUBES THEY HAVE GOOD SOUND QUALITY, and easy to mount and hook up, you only need one per vehicle."
3,good book for reading japanese but with prerequisites,"In the introduction of RJ, the authors mention the fact that RJ is synchronized with Basic Japanese volume 1 (lessons 1-20) and volume 2 (lessons 21-35), e.g., ""RJ presumes control of BJ 18, RJ 24 of BJ 34 etc."".So one should read BJ lessons 1-10 before starting to study RJ.The romaji notation used by the authors in BJ and RJ is not the Hepburn one, and can be a source of errors for a true beginner, The Hepburn system seems more familiar.There is a total absence of furigana characters to assist in Kanji reading. Those characters are helpful in the beginning. Their absence pushes one to double check the pronunciation of the Kanjis.It is not exactly a self teaching guide, no keys to the exercices.About the progressive introduction of Kanjis and their easy and permanent memorization, i am not far enough in the book to tell."
1,Do not buy this book!,"When I went to order this book all of the reviews except one gave it 5 stars. So I ordered the book, ignoring the only one star review. I am an American living in Tokyo. I took this book to my Japanese language teacher who confirmed that this book uses OLD KANJI. Please do not waste your money on this book there are many better options out there to buy."
2,Beware! No Answer key,"It has a lot of explanation but the actual reading practice, quite a lot, has absolutely NO Answer key, NO English translation."
2,I really want to like this book,"When I first got this book I loved it. It has tons of practice exercised, it uses the kanji you already know, it has a great formula for learning kanji, blah blah blah. But I could never get over the pronunciations, they are so frustrating. I can't tell you how aggravating it is to try and figure out the pronunciation of a kanji when you have to decode the authors pronunciation. And it's not just the ""ti""s being ""chi"", it's the ""tsu""s being ""tu""s, and the ""ji""s being ""zi""s, and the lines over the letters and all of this would have been fine if they just gave the kana next to the pronunciation garble. Not to mention the book is 34 years old. I don't want to say this is a bad book because it has a lot of good parts in it but I can't in good conscience give this book a good rating. There are plenty of books out there that do the same thing that are more up to date and a lot less confusing."

4,I call this my little baby thumper,"Bazooka makes a great product. I bought this for $75, added a little 80watt Fosgate amp and sold it two days later to a friend. Nice little woofer that fills the car with thump. It will not destroy your ears but you can definately hear it."
3,Uncle Karl's Strong Medicine,"If you are going to law school and you want to practice law, Iam afraid you are going to have to buy this book. But, ... does Karl really need the money?If its not required reading skip this book for now. Buy it when you get a job. Then read the book, and give it to a poor law student.This text is required reading at the University of Miami School of Law. I read it once and tossed it aside. Actually, if you read The Bramble Bush do so aloud, or at least take notes. Otherwise, good luck staying awake."
3,does not work well with SLD detector,"The SLD Detector mount from PLS does not fit on the bottom section (largest) of the PLS grade rod (without prying off the rubber feet, which makes it slide easier on the aluminum rod, which is undesireable). Poor design.... the SLD Detector mount should fit the PLS grade rod (both made by PLS). When I contacted PLS, they basically said there is no fix and have a nice day. Annoying. Note based on the prior review: My grade rod does have inches on one side and tenths on the other side."
4,Pretty good reference,I liked this book and will use it as a reference. Would definitely consider reading more books by Nancy Kress.
5,Excellent and easy to follow,"the book is written in a style that was easily understood, making it more applicable and worth every penny. There's a lot to learn to become proficient in our craft, and this book helps tremendously.I highly recommend the entire series!"
5,Extremely well delivered advice,"As a beginning writer working on my first novel I'm constantly searching for ""the book"" on a particular facet of writing. As a general book for beginners, Gotham Writer's Workshop is great. However, this book takes its subject topics and provides insights that can be immediately applied to one's writing. Her chapters on point of view (POV) provide explanations that I have not found in other books. The chapters on character emotion are also very well written.Buy this book, read it once through without doing the exercises. Then read it again, doing the exercises. You won't regret it."
3,Maleficent costume,A fun costume to wear. The headdress could be a little bit more sturdy. It wanted to droop when wearing it.
3,always wanted to be Malificent,"I ordered this for Halloween in July because the price was right. I always thought malificent was the coolest villian. I splurged and ordered the horns separately. I am SO glad I did. The horns that come with this costume are junk. I actually thought they were packing material. No way would those ever have worked.The costume was comfortable, and lasted all night- more than I can say for most Halloween Costumes. The collar is also very flimsy and will not stay up. I may reinforce it with some stiff fabric if I wear it again. If you order this, make sure you find some proper horns, or you will be disappointed."
3,Not the only agency astray!,"Does the federal government have a vested interest in crime? Escort services,massage parlors,etc. have an SIC code which is tracked and easily accessible to government officials. Having an SIC code legtimizes prostitution with the full knowledge of the government. And in bankruptcy court you can discharge credit card and other bank debt but you cannot wipe out gambling debts.So we see the legitimization of gambling and prostitution.This partnership between the government and criminal activity is scary to say the least. Informants for the govt are heavily manipulated,with their home phones continuously tapped. These informants operate by befriending people and encouraging that trust which is essential in human relationships.The tactics used and discussed about in this book should frighten anyone."
3,"Bulger,Flemmi & Mass. politics","First of all, Bulger and Flemmi reported to organized crime based out of New York, as the New England Mafia was supposed to. George Cashman(i believe) was listed in the news as beign a potential supporter of Agent Connolly. Cashman heads up Teamsters local 25 in Charlestown, which has recently come up in a federal investigation of using questionable tactics against Hollywood producers and directors. Whitey's brother Billy was one of the most powerful men in Massachusetts, being in the Senate."
2,Too long and drawn out,"I have read many books and of all the books I have read I have only left 1 unfinished. This will be my 2nd. I am 200 pages in and will not waste my time finishing it. The last one hundred pages have been the same as the first one hundred, with the authors reiterating what they already stated. The book was boring and drawn out."
2,Lacks unbiased reporting,"I read it cover to cover and back through again to find out why it was that I didn't like it. It's simple. The authors rely so heavily on the word of Flemmi, a mob ""rat,"" who felt abandoned by his FBI handlers after he was indicted, that I have a hard time lending any credence to what he says. For that matter, the authors hold such deep contempt for John Connolly that their reporting of ""true"" incidents seems terribly biased. I don't doubt that after all the court cases have made it through the system, they will right yet another book. I doubt they'll provide any further insight into this Boston scandal then they do in this book."
1,dont bother. what a bore,"This book could have been shortened to 50 pages. It was so redundant. The authors attempted (rather weakly) to create all this hype. I can summarize the book in a few sentences-- Mobsters and FBI agents conspire to commit crimes and cover up those crimes using the power of the FBI office. They get cocky, they get busted. Wow, end of story. And oh- paratroopers dont ""storm the beaches"" they ""parachute"" usually behind enemy lines to create shock and awe and disrupt the enemies supply lines. And what is a white shoe person anyway? If your'e going to write a crime novel, write a Donnie Brasco type novel, where the guy is really hanging with nads out there."
3,Disturbing,"This book was a good read but it was very disturbing. I live in the Boston area and I have family that knows some of the players involved. I think that fact made it even more chilling to me as I wasn't aware of some of the details surrounding different events. I am glad I read it, but I don't need to revisit it anytime soon."
3,Wanne be a millionaire?,"There are many questions this book raises: 1) Were these informants drafted into service using obscure Selective Service regulations?, 2)Were these informants,agents,and their families constantly manipulated in their personal associations by govt agents from other branches posing as friends and allies?,3)Was some of the money raised in these operations funneled into corporations or political campaigns? 4) Did some of the parties involved in this case have children raised in Massachusetts child care and who were used as leverage against the informants? 5) What if Flemmi and Bulger did not do all these things but are being used as scapegoats by the govt and/or organized crime?"
2,Rehash of old News Stories,"If you have read the news accounts over the last few years don't bother purchasing. The book appears to be all of the past Globe newspaper stories dressed up a little. The authors have obviously added detail of the FBI/ mobster relationships from the thousand of pages of court transcripts. However, there is little added that allows the reader to get a feel for the characters and the lives they led."
2,Good book-missing it's jacket,"This was a very interesting book, however I was disappointed that it came without the book jacket. Although I purchased it used, I planned to have it autographed by the author, so it was frustrating to not have it come with the jacket."
1,Work of Fiction,"Although this book is an interesting read, keep in mind that there are two sides to every story. This one happens to be fiction. Being from the area and knowing how the 'world' works, please don't make up your mind about Agent Connoly based on this interpretation of some facts, some fiction."
4,Scary!,"Did the FBI or some agenc(ies) have a child Bulger might have had raised in close proximity to families with government agency ties and then assert government security to cover sanitization of records and the identity of the child?In 1963 the Defense Investigative Service is said to have been formed and in the 1980s NSA opened its recruiting office in Boston,Mass. where McIntyre was allegedly killed being affiliated with the precursor to NSA. Any relationship here?If Bulger having a child sounds far-fetched, consider how such a child might be raised given all the connections identified in this case."
5,a boston vet in the know,"a must...this book is incredible..a page turner...the alliance between two (2) mobsters, one a serial killer, is compelling...the loyalty of the agents is challenged and the bad guys profer..what is great is that none of the names are changed..its all there...some may hide..but this cosiness between two killers and fbi agents will raise some eyebrows...a must!"
4,Footnote,One of the reviews has mentioned someone being harassed since this case blossomed in 1995-96. One thing to note is that attempts may be being made even now to make it look like that person for example is not really looking for work as opposed to being blackballed. This can be done easy by calling on a recorded line and carefully wording the conversation such that it appears the target is saying what you want them to say when in fact it is wrong. Or by making such terrible offers that person is unlikely to take a position then using spin to make it sound like they simply didn't give the job consideration. It sounds like someone might want that person out of work and financially broken and is covering themselves in the process.
5,Epilogue,This case is also a study on the nature of relationships within the government-/quasi-government framework. In this case we see people who had close working relationships turn on each other or be persuaded to turn on each other with promises of leniency. We see Whitey at large while one by one individuals that are said to have been close to him go down. This is also a study in tactics and ethics....
3,"The real life ""Sopranos""","""Black Mass"" is the story of a big time Irish gangster, James ""Whitey"" Bulger, and how he turned informant for the FBI. Unlike other instances where this has occurred, however, Bulger managed to corrupt his FBI handlers as they aided and abetted his twenty year crime spree. Authors Lehr and O'Neill know this story well, having covered it for many years with the local Boston newspapers. It is a good lesson in what can happen to anyone, especially a law enforcement officer, when little indescretions lead to major breaches in ethics. What the book does not have enough of, unfortunately, are first hand descriptions of the mobsters plying their trade. There is some of it in the book, but most of the stories are second hand. Unlike other notable recent mob stories, like ""Wise Guy"" and ""Underboss,"" the focus is not on mob life itself. Overall, I found the book to be about a hundred pages or so too long, though still an interesting read for anyone who like real life crime stories."
3,"Great topic, but left me a little flat","I read this book with great expectations, but it didn't fully deliver. Despite the fascinating subject matter, and some gripping passages, it reads like a ""rush job"" and collage of old newspaper stories. Still, fans of the ""true crime"" genre should find it worth their while. Also take a look at George V Higgins's last novel, ""At End of Day"", which treats the same topic."
3,Premature judgement?,"The bulk of the information available for this book and the case in general comes from newspaper accounts, but sometimes false information is released to conceal the investigation. Is this the case here? If so we may not want to rush to judgement.A civil case involving a number of agents and the informants is in the works with Judge Wolf allegedly presiding.Agent Rico is unable to be charged due to insufficient evidence. Connolly, trained by Rico, continues to be a major target. Frank Salemme, for years targeted to be an informant and allegedly harassed as such, is said to be cooperating now. Caught in the middle are the families and friends of the agents and informants involved.There seem to be few avenues of getting potentially relevant information to the FBI. Likewise, we don't know how objectively any leads are treated."
4,License to kill....,"This book is a good intro but leaves out any detail about the agents involved or the prosecutors.It does not address early concerns in the case,such as how the FBI is alleged to be involved with such things as pornography as well.It also treats this case as an anomaly, but as Congressman James Trafficante of Ohio noted on the news show ""Nightline"", FBI agents have been alleged to have a similar arrangement there in Ohio. It seems as if the real 'Mafia' is actually a conglomeration of gangsters and govt employees from many branches of govt ,and not just the FBI.Once into this network, you have the protection of being the police while the underground connections for cleverly concealing your activities."
4,A good read if you're interested in the subject matter,"Interesting journalistic account of the Bulger Mob and its connections to the government. Good insight into how Bulger used those connections to destroy the Italian Mob in New England. A bit of a turn around for an Irish gang in the 20th Centuary.J.R. Locke Author of Possible Twenty, a Gangster Tale."
4,Unbelievable!,"A very disturbing look into organized crime and it's associations with the Boston branch of the FBI. Boston politicos, Mafia informants and low-life criminals turn Beantown into a playground for greed, murder and a fast track to power. Amazingly, it took more than sixteen years to finally track down and capture Whitey Bolger. Complicity with law enforcement, shoddy police work or was Whitey just too clever? I can't wait for another installment of this dark and complicated saga."
4,Legendary Boston mobster tied to the FBI.,"Great book about the Irish mob in Boston and their leader ""Whitey"" Bugler's mix-up with the FBI. Being Irish and growing up in the same neighbourhood built a stronger bond that what side on the law they were working for. The FBI detective John Connolly and the people around him managed to include the fearsome leader as an informant to get information on the Italian mob, and in return keep him informed and sheltered from the police/authorities. The authors (Boston Globe reporters) managed to uncover this unbelievable and compelling story. The book is well written and keeps up the excitment from start to finish."
2,Disappointed...,It was not what I believed it to be. My mistake. I will have to look more closely when I am ordering something that has been suggested to me but not seen.
5,Beautiful photography,"This is a lovely book. I bought it for adults and not children. If you love deer, you will love this."
5,Magical..so sweet..,"My 6 year old daughter is a great reader.. and she loves this story.I almost tear up everytime she reads it to me. Her sweet little voice telling the story is magical..Our whole family loves this one. I recently bought ""Stranger in the Woods"" and that is our new favorite!The photography is absolutely stunning in these books, and you are truely made to feel like you are there with the warmth of the animals in the forest.."
5,great book!,This book has amazing pictures and opens up the world of animals to all readers in a new way. It has a very creative storyline to go along with the pictures taken in the woods. I started reading his book alone and by the time I was finished I had children sitting with me engrossed in the story. It's a book for all ages. If you love nature photography this is a great book for you!
5,Best Of Two Worlds/The Soul Children=Best Two Albums By The Soul Children,"Stax records in Memphis had more than a handfull of doo wop groups. The Soul Children were the best of the bunch. They were unique because any of the group members could sing lead as well as backgound. The combination of Isaac Hayes compositions and musical arrangements and vocal performances of Blackfoot and company was a winning sonic proposition. These two albums represent the early to mid lifespan of the Soul Children at Stax combining exceptionally soulful tracks recorded in Memphis and in Detroit. These are the two greatest albums by this group, two of the best albums Stax Records ever put out."
4,Music for the Soul,The CD for the group Soul Children is excellent. Music that really sing about Love and Pain. Recommend it to anyone who knows the ups and downs of love.
3,Picture did not represent product,"The picture given for the item did not represent the product not even slightly which is somewhat deceiving. Other than that inconvenience, the equipment works fine."
1,Not what's pictured,"What is pictured is not what you get. Pictured is a DVT 1st stage, with a non-swivel 2nd stage Delta 4 (and exactly what I wanted as I'm trying to get away from swivels and the proprietary hoses that go with them). What I received, and what LeisurePro said is the only option for this Amazon listing, is a Non-DVT 1st stage with a swivel 2nd stage. Completely opposite of what I wanted."
4,Increased my understanding and appreciation of God's love,"Heschel's treatise on Old Testament prophets and prophecy greatly increased, even changed, my appreciation and understanding of God. God is a loving Father whose judgment and punishment are intended to turn men back to their Creator and Savior. He is patient, quick to forgive and even quicker to relent--sparing those who turn to Him--from the judgment He proclaimed.The 2 volumes are not ""easy reading"" even for those who are familiar with the Scriptures. I had to read it through twice in order to feel I grasped Heschel's insights and commentary. But the time and effort are amply rewarded when we can say, in awe, ""My God, How Great Thou Art."""
5,A Modern Prophet,"Before reading The Prophets by Abraham Heschel, I had thought of the writings of the Prophets as angry diatribes against the people they were intended for, but Heschel sees these men, on the one hand, as passionate lovers of God who must relate to their people the wrath of God and the consequences of their behavior, and on the other hand, vulnurable human beings themselves whose compassion for these same people moves them to beg God for mercy, for one more chance.One is also able to see, through Heschel's eyes, the tremendous love of God for these same people and even though they bring their troubles on themselves, God is always compassionate, forgiving, and eternally loving.Abraham Heschel's writings are not only profound and moving but also written in a flowing prose style that attracts the modern reader.I heartily recommend this book to fans of Heschel as well as to those who might see the Old Testament as a book of judgment and condemnation. Heschel will cure you of that."
5,Truly a classic,"I return to this book year after year. Very holistic, spiritual, and intellectual. The best I've read on the subject. Truly a classic."
1,Great Topic - Very Poorly Written,"The book covers an amazing subject matter and I was excited to get it and dive into but. But after slogging through the first 100 pages, I had to see what other reviewers may have said on Amazon. I see that a few agree with me. The topic is one of the most amazing of our time, but the writing is horribly academic, boring, and poor. Gregg Herken's writing style (if one can even call it that) is similar to a law review article, where facts are piled up high, references are many, but any style and creativity is buried. In this book, it's does not exist. I would not recommend this to other to read."
4,A matter of enjoyment,I specifically enjoy the ability of this author to make the reader to feel part of the story..The characters introduced are people we have had an experience with in our lives.
2,Passe,"Have you ever come across a movie that you loved in your youth and watched it again, only to find out that what you had enjoyed so much had become trite? This is what I thought of this book, so much so that I put it down (which I have done less than 10 times in my life. The narrative is stilted and maybe it is an American vs Brit thing but I also felt it was amateurish.Don't get me wrong, I have read may Archer novels and loved ""As the Crow Flies"" which I read several times and recommended to family. But I kept thinking about the believably and boneheadedness of the dialogue and realized I just didn't care. At All."
4,A Matter of Honor,"A Matter of Honor is the first book I have read by this author. The beginning was slow, but once the story began to have alot of action, I could not put this book down. This is truly a great story. I will be reading more stories from this author."
4,A matter of honor,"Easy reading as, with most of Archers works. I found the book entertaining and a nice way to spend some spare time!"
3,A typical tale,It had all the suspense and the right amount of twists to be a Archer's tale. nothing new to ask for.
4,Archer at his best,A Matter Of Honor is another Jeffrey Archer tour de force. It is a typical Archer book in the manner that it weaves the story togeather through character development. The characters are all very interesting and it is quite a good tale that Archer tells. The best part for me is that the ending was a little bit different from what I was expecting.
2,Unnecessarily Long,"This was the first book I've read by Jeffrey Archer and I don't know if I will read another - I at least won't PAY to read another in any case. While the story was interesting enough for me to want to finish it to see exactly how it ended, I was often frustrated while reading it and came away feeling that it was unnecessarily long. There were several sections that felt to me that they did not contribute much to the story or were lengthened considerably for no real reason at all except if the author were being paid by the page. I also felt Archer tried to make the story super-complicated, almost as if taunting the reader to try to keep up with him. The only real praise I can give this work is that he enticed me to want to finish it, rather than reaching the 50 page threshold and deciding to not waste my time."
1,boring and confusing,"I found this to be slow moving, confusing and boring. The characters were uninteresting and the book just didn't grab me. For these reasons, I didn't finish reading it. So perhaps I'm not the best person to write a review. Nevertheless, that's my opinion.Ron W"
1,This was possibly the most dull and unsightful book.,"This was possibly the most dull, and uninsightful book that I have ever read. The way Jeffery Archer's book is set up, creats a long begining and the reader compleatly looses interest with in the first two chapters. I definetly don't recomen this book to any one who doesn't have the time or interest to read a dull, and limited intrest book."
3,a matter of honor,Overall I thouhgt the book was pretty interesting. The plot was intriguing and it keep moving along at a good pace. It got a bit confusing at the end as the author tried to summerize to give you some clarity. Worth the read.
2,A matter of Honor,Usually I like Jeffery Archer's books. But this one must have been one of his first and it shows. Am forcing myself to finish it.
1,Found it awful,Unsure why people rated this high. I couldn't finish the book; it was that bad.Major problem is that the main character is a complete fool.
4,A good old fashioned page turner,This would have earned a five star rating had the Kindle version not been awash in typographical errors. Lots of cold war action and unexpected turns. As a new Kindle owner I can only hope that all the books don't look as if they were the pre-proof reader copy.
5,An excellent thriller,"Archer's A Matter of Honor is, I think, one of the best thrillers out there, and one of my most riveting reads. I has almost everything that makes a thriller a book not to put down -- from a rich plot full of intrigues, timely revelations and breath-taking suspense; to characters that are colorful, rugged, vicious, smart and daring; to a setting that is far-reaching, complex and fascinating. The encompassing nature of this story brings to mind the story of Gavin in Triple Agent Double Cross. If you are looking for a full thriller, one that has adventure, murder, integrity, values and love, A Matter of Honor is the book to read."
3,Good escape reading,"Earlier Archer and Cold War related as in mid 80's time frame. Tightly plotted, a bit overdone at times, but still a good escape story."
2,A Matter of Honor,"I usually like Jeffrey Archer books but this one was just too far out to connect to. After struggling with it for 100 pages, I gave up."
2,Editing...please.,"I will give this book two stars only for the storyline. It was clever, but such a laborious chore to read and try to edit at the same time. Errors included switching main characters names so that it changed the authors meaning. So unprofessional. The author should not have allowed this unedited version to be published digitally."
3,A Matter Of Honor,"Jeffrey Archer is good, but I'm not sure I'll be purchasing another of his works in the near future. I find him a little hard to follow and at times it's a chore to get through a chapter.TWM"
5,Jeffrey Archer - Author,"I love all of Archer's books...A Matter of Honor; Not a Penny Less or More, etc. He has a wonderful way of getting you intimately involved with each character and when reading his books, you become involved in the plot as well. Great books!"
4,Interesting to me,"Nice read!! For collectors and those with military experience or background, its good. Plenty of action for those who crave a bit of excitement>"
1,"Very ""broken"" read, sometimes hard to follow and still didn't seem to come to a complete end","Did not care for the book. I like the concept of all the different people/background/nations looking for the same item and much of the chase was interesting (not very realistic, but interesting), but the book never ""all came together"" at the end. You were left with unanswered questions and it left you frustrated after trying so hard to keep it all straight throughout the book."
1,Very thin material!! Not as described,"I was expecting a thick, heavier material but instead got the same exact cheap material that I had purchased at walmart for $5. Its so thin that you cannot keep it on the table when you wipe it- it moves around because it is not heavy enough to stay put. And there was no tissue paper that some of the other reviewers mentioned. Whats going on?? Did they change the product to a cheaper one and not update the description? Very very dissapointed."
2,'ts ok i guess,"Whell, I was hoping for a thick, plastic tablecloth that stays in one place and protects my table from my disturbingly messy kids. Well one out of three aint' baaaad! Actually, it is a bit sucky, because it is thin and slides around a lot...think of those paper tablecloths from birthday parties, but not quite as bad. Hey, it IS better than nothing though. I s'pose it's worth the twelve bucks to protect my table long enough to order a better tablecloth. Eh, whaddya gonna do?"
1,Wrong size,"Company was out of the size that I ordered. Rather than notify me, they sent a different size and when I contacted them they suggested I just cut it. That defeats the purpose of ordering a specific size with trim around the edge! Was not worth the shipping to return so they refunded cost."
5,Perfect,"Having young children it can often be a challenge to decorate around the holidays and keep it looking nice. This clear table cover is the perfect addition to your holiday table. The quality material and durability makes it a regular use item as well. My twins spilled and made messes but the holiday table cloth and other decorative items never had to experience it. We simply wiped up the spills. If you have children or pets and want to keep your table clean but beautiful, this is the item to buy. Don't settle for the inferior quality found at local stores. This is what you are really looking for."
4,Fits perfect and thick enough to last a good while.,The tablecloth protector is durable and heavy enough to protect a beautiful crocheted tablecloth made by my deceased mother-in-law. I am very comfortable using this tablecloth protector to protect a family treasure.
2,Not that great,This plastic is just so difficult to unwrinkle! I do like the trim stitching but that is all I liked. I think if you can't find one cheaper at walmart or ?? this may suit your needs. But for me it just didn't work. Maybe for kids and art it won't matter but.....
4,As advertised,"This clear vinyl tablecloth is well made. However, I use it on a glass tabletop and vinyl emits a film after time. Eventually if the sun is shining on it just right, it looks messy. I do remove it and clean both sides, but I wish they could come up with a ""clear"" covering that actually stays clear. If you put this over a tablecloth, there is no problem and it would be great."
4,gunner,"this toy is really fun. it comes with a grass stand a pistol, a standerd blaster, a removable helmet, and a cover that makes it so it can be a clone, a gunner, or a commander, the sholders and elbpws dont move the best and some times the bottom half of the arm will fall of. this is a really fun figure. for a great price to."
4,get your tissues ready,great book. the saddest ending i have ever read. i must have cried for the last 100 pages. at least...
4,Read Pride of Lions first,I read Blood of Roses not knowing it was the sequel to Pride of Lions. I think I would have understood the storyline better if I had known about and read Pride first. This is the continuation of that story as it is about the same two characters. I enjoyed the story fine but I think they focused a little too much on the fighting and not on the love story. So much blood shed and death. Not a favorite of mine but enjoyable nonetheless.
4,Hot Scot!,"I love all things Scottish and this novel utterly satisfied me. I know there are lots of Scottish-themed romance novels out there, but this one was different. I can only think of one other (Willing Captive by Leah Brown) that thrilled me as much. I would recommend this novel to anyone just starting out in romance novels or those that have read them for years."
5,Rivals Outlander!,"In 1991, author Diana Gabaldon wroteOutlander, a book that is hauntingly vivid and beautiful in its depiction of Scotland, the Highlands, the people and the heartache of the battle of Culloden. I read Outlander and its impact on me has been tremendous. Since then, I have read many Highlander books in search of another book that can capture Scotland and its beauty in the same manner. The Blood of Roses is as good as Outlander. Buy it, read it, savor it. Its brutal, beautiful and captivating. I'm in love with Scotland all over again."
5,History Can Be Heartbreaking.,"I can't possibly say it better than ""gigibookworm."" She expressed my feelings exactly. I cried my heart out through this book, particularly the last half. I knew what I was heading into in THE BLOOD OF ROSES after finishing the first book in the series, THE PRIDE OF LIONS. Historically savvy, I knew what was going to happen, but Marsha Canham explicitly describes what the history books leave out.I am now reading the third novel about Colonel Anne and am expecting to cry throughout it as well. It is so hard to accept that these things really happened to the Scottish people. I don't like to cry my heart out because it makes my eyes hurt so badly, so I'm not sure that I can say that I really ""enjoyed"" reading this series. All I can say is that it broke my heart.The love stories woven into this historical series are wonderful and make the series well worth reading if you don't mind a good cry."
3,the blood of roses,"The first book in the pair was very good, but I must say this one was very heavy on history and light on romance content. It was well written and historically correct, but I was not drawn into the story and the characters lives as I was in the first novel. The ending was more like frayed threads rather than a tightly woven finish."
3,not his best,"OK. I admit I like Jerry Rivera because he has an awesome voice. But also becaue he loks so fine!! Let's face it. The guy epitomizes the hot bodied latino hunk.now that that's out of the way... I really wanted to like this album.... I mean..... cuz he's hot and I like some of his other stuff. But the ballads are really ""Backstreet Boys rejected songs that wound up on someone else's album"" They really have almost nothing going for them EXCEPT(!!!) Rivera's voice.The songs are pleasant as background music. Pleasant beat. beautiful voice..... But if you're wanting to actively listen.... they are sort of disappointing. I'm not sad I bought it. There's a hot pull out with fotos of Rivera looking mighty mighty hunky. and like I said... it's not terrible. But Luis Miguel ""Romances"" albums are a better example of how to do an album like this."
4,"Decent, but could be improved","Great concept for easily getting firewood the same length. However, the plastic rods break FAR too easily. Even a brief shock will snap them. They should be made from a stiff but FLEXIBLE plastic. I cut to 16"" so when after two trips my 16"" rod broke I cut the 18"" rod to fit and used that. Then when that one broke I was out of luck.I'll go to Lowes and buy a stainless steel, threaded rod to fit in the nut. The nut is the best part of this kit! They should sell extra rods, in any particular length you want, in a 12 pack or something like that. You're going to need them."
4,It's all about image!,"That is what John Rebus finds when he is dealing with an MP who has been caught in a house of ill repute. John keeps going back to Gregor Jack trying to help him fix the damage to his career, but while this is going on Jack's wife is missing. Rebus has many bad feelings, and when her body turns ups, Rebus and his faithful Sergeant Holmes trail a killer. The investigation throws them up against some of the so-called ""cream"" of society, and John has to pussyfoot around in order not to upset feelings. These Rebus books are really good. I enjoy Rankin's eccentric and spare writing style. I also enjoy the look at Scotland that the books give. And most of all I enjoy Rebus. He is a real character! The mysteries are always quite complex. Lots of fun."
5,strip jack by ian rankin,excellent i am hooked will buy more have nt guessed the murderer yet. love the relaxed style but its hearty
3,An early thriller,In Strip Jack Rankin is still finding his voice. The story involves many characters and they easily confuse the reader though the plot itself is interesting and highly engaging. This particular paperback edition has a major problem in its very dense spacing; the lines are very close to each other and there is little white space. Overall a good though early thriller.
3,"Rebus, Politics, and Murder",This is a very good Rebus novel -- the intersection of murder and politics make it better than some of the others.
2,A slight addition to an excellent series.,"STRIP JACK is not one of the stronger books in the ""Rebus"" series. In this one, Rebus becomes interested in the trials and tribulations of an MP who is caught during a raid on a brothel. This leads to a couple of murders that may or may not be related and Rebus getting involved just out of curiosity. Rankin just seems to be going through the motions on this one, the mysteries are not very interesting and relatively straight forward, Rebus's usual emotional response seems distant and he seems to be in a state of befuddlement about life, career, and even the politics involved in the case. STRIP JACK lacks the laser-like focus of Rankin's other episodes and while I don't think Rankin has written a bad Rebus novel, this one is just a filler."
5,My favorite Ian Rankin thus far,"This is the 4th book in Ian Rankin's series about Detective Inspector John Rebus, set in Edinburgh and is the best so far.I read series in order, so character development makes sense: book 1 is Knots and Crosses, 2 is Hide and Seek and 3 is Tooth and Nail.This book inspired me to keep on reading late at night, which is high praise from me.Rebus solves complicated crimes and debates about where his relationship with Dr. Patience Aitken is going.Stolen rare books, Gregor Jack who is a respected MP caught in a brothel, two murdered women and an intriguing group of childhood friends all grown up who are still friends and enjoy wild secret parties together.These elements combine to create a book I highly recommend."
4,best ever Rebus?,"Having grown up in Scotland I've read quite a few of these out of pure nostalgia for the olde country......this one is perhaps the best I've read so far as Rankin ditches the faux working class realism of junkies and serial killers and moves into perhaps his own (and therefore most comfortable) world, that of the Range Rover driving middle classes. At heart Rebus, with his flat and his girlfriends and hi-fi, is still a middle class hero, and I can picture him having a couple of pints with Inspector Morse, even if Rankin would perhaps shudder at that thought........"
2,"doesnt suck, but it doesnt rock either","sad story short, this CD is entirely in japanese. i'm a filthy american and i cant do jack squat with it (i own a PC and it didnt work in my stereo either). so unless you're a computer hacking genius and you know how to work this stuff out, buy it. but if you thought you could just pop it in your computer and import it into itunes, you might want to reconsider."
5,This is the best Hindi-English dictionary imaginable,"My only regret is that there is no English-Hindi counterpart. This book includes all common usages of words in conjunction with verbs, as well as variations and related words. Also very helpful is the origin of each word, and its spelling in its language of origin. If you are student of Hindi, I could not recommend a better book. Mr. McGregor is my hero."
2,The Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary,This is a clear and well presented dictionary but provides no transliterated roman version of the hindi words. You need to be able to read sanskrit to understand it.
2,NOT FOR BEGINNERS!,"I have no prior experience with devanagri or with the Hindi alphabet, I was HOPING to use this to translate some words in songs or movies I saw, but it is nearly impossible to use as an effective reference in this way without the background knowledge I mentioned."
5,Wish we could afford several copies.,"This is the best go-to dictionary if you are a native English speaker trying to look up a word you are reading in Hindi. I bought this for reading theocratic literature in the Hindi language and most usually the word that I need a definition for is in this book! It has a very easy-to-follow pronunciation guide, too. I wish they had an app! Google translate would do in a pinch, but not if I have this book around. I would carry it with my in my bag and try to learn a few words a day."
1,Christmas Music,Disliked this CD. Majority of songs were played and sung very slow - sounded like amateurs rather than professionals. Definitely not worth the price. Should be sold at a dollar store.
5,Hot C.D. but just a cheap way to cash in.,"Honestly Alex Gargolas really didnt have anything else to do with his franchise. Regardless, this album is a very excellent album encorporating what his franchise felt were the best hits to date out of all the Gargolas album. I give it 5 stars for the thought of throwing this album out for those who really havent bought the gargolas albums. This will surely be ear candy for those who are getting into gargolas.For me, on the other hand, this is just a cheap way to get my money which worked unfornately. I've heard every song here before so this is nothing new"
4,Another great movie by Uwe Boll,It's sad that so many people fail to give Uwe Boll movies a chance. Postal is another great movie right up there with Bloodrayne as one of my favorite Boll films. The comedy and laughs from this film are genuine and the fact it's out on Blu-ray is just phenomenal. Buy it now!
4,political sociosatire doesnt get any better!,"being off put simply by the name uwe boll, is a terrible reason to not see this movie...from the opening scene to the ending credits the laughter and unadulterated shock never stop. boll takes shots and punches (literally in one scene) at everything 'hollywood' is afraid to even speak of. the balls to parody 9/11 is great, dave foley nearly steals the show, and god save me i loved osama bin laden in this film!its so over the top, out of control, and wrong on so many levels that it worked to near perfection. the blu-ray quality is actually surprisingly good (side the extras that are all standard def and low quality.).this movie is a well deserved 4.5/5 and highly recommended.~J~"
4,Pretty funny,"Pretty funny movie. Sort of loosely based on the game Postal--storyline maybe not so much but character and thematically pretty similar.If you liked the game, you will like the movie."
3,"Uwe Boll's masterwork, but it's still not very good","""Postal"" is a plotless mess of a movie. I've never seen so much random stuff tossed into a film. Much of it is unfunny, tasteless and stupid. But the upside of a movie that throws so much stuff at the wall is that some of it sticks. There are some genuinely funny bits and ideas in ""Postal,"" executed with remarkably workmanlike ability. The whole opening sequence (except for the last few seconds, which don't make any sense in the context of the scene and are there for deliberate tastelessness) is pretty funny. The rest of ""Postal"" manages to deliver on about that level.I don't know how Boll managed to land Zack Ward and Dave Foley for this movie, but their performances are what make this watchable. (With the exception of Foley's full frontal nudity. I respect that he's willing to do that, I guess, but no one wants to see that.) There's no reason to buy this, but it might be worth a rent if you're in the mood for a comedy and are not easily offended."
1,Bad Movie - Uwe Boll worst Director Ever,"Sorry but this movie is unintelligable like most of his other work.avoid this movie, like everything else Uwe Boll does. This time the German director attempts Satire, but it just in not funny, nor good action. or anything worth watching. I am stupified at how he puts good actors in a movie, but then has the worst script ever, then the worst directing job ever.avoid at all costs."
1,Crap,This movie was not funny at all. okay it had some funny parts but uit was one of the stupidest movies i've since. it up there with borat and bruno.
2,Juggling the english language,"I bought this book just to see what is being published by the far right wing. If you you twist your mind around enough, you can see how this can make sense to some people looking for an explanation of why the world is like it is. Not really an enjoyable read, it made me angry more than it made me think, but it did have some creepy flashes of insight."
4,Good for giving ideas,"This book is not a step-by-step guide. Moore never says it would be. It allows you to see what others have built and get ideas for your own observatory - what is a better/different way to do what I want. An added bonus is that his first book (Small Astronomical Observatories) is included as a CD in the back (I had been looking for it for a while with no luck).Most observatories are going to be of simple construction. If you can drive a nail and cut a piece of wood, you are well on your way. A bit of cement work and you are 99% there. I used information from 4 units to design my own. Yes, some of the designs are on the internet and he gives web addresses where they exists.It meets my needs for information and I would not hesitate to suggest this book to anyone thinking about building a small observatory."
1,more small astronomical observatories,"This book is as if you had a... tour through a garden of private observatories. There is very little technical content to be gleamed if you were wanting to make your own observatory and how to control it. Most of the material that is there, can be easily found in minutes on the internet. If I could give a lower rating I would. It was a waste of my money"
3,it takes a while,It took me half the movie to recognize we weren't dealing with absolutely serious stuff here! Then I realized how silly some of the lines and scenes were and had a rather good laugh. Weller and Hopper are perfect for the tongue in cheek approach. Weller in that little train shot may have been a waste of talent but it was a riot.I don't know what the intentions of this film were but it's worth a watch and a chuckle.
3,Larger than expected Item,"To clarify, I have given 3 stars NOT because of quality and function; this is an excellent product if you need BIG, heavy-duty stay rollers. It was just not the size I was looking for. Be aware that these are very large stay-rollers and not for the application I was looking for (holding rolling doors in place in a residential home). No doubt if you need industrial this is the product for you."
2,"It might be convenient, but it is a waste.",There are enough ipod charges and wall outlets that I have never been in desperate need for a quick charge. I don't like carrying an extra battery that will get thrown away when I could just bring my power cord that I can reuse as many times as I want for no extra cost.
1,Out of date,"This was brand new, but probably 15 years old. Technology has made major leaps since the day this was manufactured. For instance it has a 24 pin connector to interface with a computer. How many years has that connection been unavailable?"
2,Mostly outdated designs,"There were a couple of somewhat interesting bathrooms featured, but most of the designs looked a little dated. Many of the ""high end"" bathrooms shown had features that I am trying to replace in my own bathroom. If you are looking for things such as blue toilets and tile countertops, than this is the book for you."
1,not hot enough,"It did not straighten my hair type 3 hair enough for me, even at the hottest setting."
2,Not Hot Enough,Not the best pressing comb I have had. It does not get hot enough for my liking. I can still straighten my hair with it but the one I owned before was way better.
5,I love musicals,This movie are great I can watch them over and over againI have also just seeing this Show on the Stage and is wondeful
5,South Pacific is a must own VHS for all collectors,No collection will be complete without South Pacific in it. A rare classic.
4,An all-time classic,"I bought this DVD for my mother for Mother's Day and although she's watched it only once, she loved every minute of it. The graphics, as you might expect, are not on the same level as movies of today, but the singing, acting, and scenes are superb! Definitely a quality movie for family viewing, a date, or party. Americans today have forgotten about the great classics and this is definitely one of them."
3,soundtrack troubles,it sounds like there are different audio tracks- when 2 or more are talking some sound very mute others normal
2,Movie Pundits right,"Movie pundits are right. While I enjoyed the movie this was rather lack lustre. I would have liked Mary Martin and Ezio Pinza, from Broadway, to have starred in the movie, but then maybe the less than glowing movie was a reult of director's work."
2,a disappointment,"Two stars for the music....they didn't hurt the music. Minus 3 stars for messing with the color, bigtime...whose idea was it to add the colored-lens-look on and off thoroughout the movie? Wish I hadn't bought this one."
2,Excellent moral buried under a ton of discolored ham,"The long-running classic Broadway musical about romance in the Pacific theater of WWII took awhile to make it to film, and it just does not hold up over time. The dubbed-in operatic baritone by an Italian actor playing a Frenchman with an Italian accent both when he speaks and when he sings (?) sounds ludicrous to the 21st-century ear, the dialogue is frequently laughable, and the bizarre directorial decision to film some scenes through color filters that just look nasty, combine to make this an exceptionally overrated piece of nostalgic cheese. Plenty of ham to go with it, too. Bleah. The only reason there's more than one star in my rating is that the film does very well in making its point against racism, a socially redeeming factor that was very much germaine in the late '50s. But that's no reason anyone should be subjected to this snoozer at this late date."
1,Joshua Logan has no business behind the movie camera,"South Pacific on film should have been the finest of all R&H musicals but was ruined by Joshua Logan. The direction is dreadful. Everyone is miscast except Juanita Hall and she was dubbed, yet she did the show on broadway. Where was the choreography? It didn't exist. The ""Nothin Like a Dame"" number is embarrassing to watch. Enough has been said about the disgusting use of color filters, but that is the least of this travesty's problems. A great work of the American Muscial Theatre bastardized by the useless Josh Logan. He also ruined Camelot and Paint Your Wagon on the screen."
1,Wait for a better edition,This widescreen movie is NOT anamorphic. Save yer money! Widescreen and NOT anamorphic? What's the point!!!!
1,Poor film.,Poor direction and a plodding pace ruin this film. Hollywood took a wonderful Broadway musical and destroyed it. The only good thing about it is the music. The cd of the soundtrack is absolutely glorious. But the film itself is perfectly dreadful. And what was with the different lens colors for the different songs? I found that totally unnecessary and positively ANNOYING!
1,dissapointed,"I was dissapointed with quality of the color. It was like looking at old phots that faded with time. They could have done a better job at cleaning up the color. The night sceans were almost purple and the day sceans by the ocean were washed out. For the price of the dvd they could have digitly remastered the entire movie and had a better quality.It wasn't worth the $21,99 paid."
5,One Great Story,I watched this movies when I was a young teenager. I will always love this movies till I am 90 years old or older
4,"Good reissue, but technically not the best","The 1950-something motion picture version of South Pacific was reissued in 1998. The musical is of course wonderful, and I'm glad I bought it, but they waited a little too long to do the technical improvement -- the colors shift a bit while you are watching a single scene. Overall, a worthwhile buy (until the Lincoln Center version finally gets released; get it when it is!)"
1,Not For Me,Have never seen this before so after seeing the stage show thought I shoud give it another go. Unfortunately still not a lover!
3,So-so at best,"Beautiful scenery. Beautiful people. Wonderful story. Unfortunately Mitzi Gaynor, as beautiful as she is, is only a second rate Nellie. She is unbelievable as an innocent small-town girl. If you want to see and hear Nellie as she SHOULD be, get South Pacific in Concert with Reba as Nellie. Plus... Reba can sing!"
3,ONLY ADEQUATE ADAPTATION,"Well let's be realistic this musical comedy is the least interesting of all the adaptations of RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN's classic shows.The fact that JOSHUA LOGAN had directed the original show makes you wonder if the guy knew how great the show was in 1949.If you remember, SOUTH PACIFIC had great singers to sing the songs.Where are the singers in the movie?What's the use of making a movie musical if anyone but one character gets dubbed;a complete aberration?RAY WALSTON fortunally manages to get you a few laughs as LUTHER.I suppose the film can be tolerable if you've never seen the musical on stage.It would be a great mistake to judge this wonderful show only by this movie.Young folks be warned and please buy the original cast album with MARY MARTIN and ENZIO PENZA"
5,pleased to deal with,"The item arrived quickly, and the box was in excellent condition. Movie was not rewound, which irked me a little ;) but I'm very happy to have it."
3,bad product management,I canceled one copy of south pacific because it was going to be sent to the wrong address. I got notification that the cancellation was recorded and it would not be sent and I would not be charged. It was sent and I was charged. Not worth sending back -- but if you check you will find notice of cancellation approved.
3,Roadshow Version not HD,"Warning! Be aware that the extended roadshow version of South Pacific found on disk #2 is in standard definition! Nowhere in the product description or packaging is this mentioned. Also the extra 14 or so minutes of extra content found on the roadshow version are composed mainly of inferior, degraded, unrestored footage.The theatrical release version on disk #1 is of outstanding quality for a film of this vintage."
4,"Real ""feel good"" ,Movie","I have always loved this movie and its companion music. It brings back memories of a softer, more gentle time. Boy, do we need that now!"
5,Excellent entertainment and social commentary.,"""South Pacific"" is an excellent musical and this film does it justice.It actually tells the stories behind many wars, yet is very personal. The music is hypnotic and the lyrics profound. In this production, the performers do an excellent job as is the cinematography. It's a classic that will be a treasured addition to anyone's film collection."
5,Beautiful Musical,This is one of the great musicals of all time. The Blu-ray technology captures the beautiful mood colorings of certain of the backgrounds. I would recommend this to anyone who loves films from the greatest musical team of the 20th century.
5,Rogers and Hammerstein do it again; Mitzi Gaynor is...fabulous!,"One of my fav's. The photography of the area is awesome. The storyline shows how some people's predjudices were formed in their early years, and they don't know why they feel like they do. This is a great adaptation of James Michener's 'Tales of the South Pacific' and due to filming, the storyline varies a bit from the original stage play. What doesn't change is the awesome music, the great songs, like Bali Hai, Nothing like a Dame, and the wonderful 'Some Enchanted Evening'. Mitzi Gaynor is fantastic in acting and singing and co-star Rosanno Brazzi is great (though his songs were sung by the great Giorgio Tozzi.)There are a lot of great supporting stars like Ray Walston, and the Bloody Mary character which was also taken from Michener's book.The love stories (there are two), the fun songs, the wonderful times, the sadder times and the background of WWII action make this a movie to keep in your video library, and watch occasionally."
5,Great Movie Classic!,VHS tape was in perfect condition. No problems. It was great to see this movie to compare with my grandson playing in the play.
3,Interesting racial themes,"The Collectors Edition DVD set contains all that anyone interested in this movie could want.I became familiar with all the South Pacific songs as a child but didn't actually watch the movie until middle-age. I found it unexpectedly strange but interesting - particularly the racist aspects of the story. Despite the soul searching, ""you have to be taught to hate"", etc it is still a product of its time. The brown wife of the white French planter is conveniently dead and the young American ""Lieutenann"" is also killed to avoid the embarrassment of miscegenation."
5,Collectors Editions Rock,I am very happy with this classic musical. Great picture quality. A favorite extra of mine is the Karaoke songs only option. So much fun!
3,WARNING: Great film - BUT NOT ANAMORPHIC!,This DVD has THX and DOLBY. I just figured it would be anamorphic... NOPE. IT SHOULD SAY LETTERBOX.. but it doesn't.I hate being tricked!This has nothing to do with film.. it is awesome!
1,Terrible! Gaynor gives her worst performance ever as Nellie!,"The show was wonderful, but the movie was plain old bad. It was good in some ways, but bad in most. You'll be dissapointed if you watch this movie."
2,Disappointing Treatment of a Classic Show,"I saw this film about 2 years ago, and was not impressed. I tried to watch it again last night and was thoroughly disappointed. What is a great and moving show on stage becomes one big thudding dud of a film. One of Rogers & Hammerstein's best scores is lost amid this wan cast. Mitzy Gaynor is far too earnest and perky, though she can sing. Rosanno Brazzi is pretty right-on casting - sensual and sexy; one can understand why a younger woman would fall for him; I echo the sentiments about John Kerr - not exactly the type one envisions as the great lover. Ray Walston is an embarassment as the ""comic"" lead. The use of the color filters is distracting beyond tolerance. Apparently, Logan wanted to elminate them, but there wasn't time or money.I look forward to seeing this classic on stage to do justice to how wonderful it can be with the right elements."
1,This musical did not age well. I'm very disappointed.,"This musical did not age well at all. I'm crushed and disappointed. Purchased for my granddaughter based on my memory of the film, but the acting was weak and stilted, with the exception of the old Polynesian dame, who was WONDERFUL. Still, not worth the money or experience of seeing it again."
4,South Pacific Movie,"It's a classic who wouldn't love it. It was a gift for my mother and she loves it. She has enjoyed it over the years and was excited to see it again. I am so glad that I was able to purchase it from Amazon. Thanks, Amazon for making it so easy."
5,"Les's take on ""South Pacific""","Best musical ever put on film, best ""South Pacific"" you will ever see, even more magnificent in Blu-Ray format. Brings back many good memories of my time on Guam."
3,South Pacific,Better than expected. This is a Hollywood musical but even so it's a cut above most in that classification. It touches on the underlying problem of racial bigotry well enough for a musical.
5,great music and great actors,"i have seen this movie too many times to know. one of my favorite all-time movies. then there is the music. what can i say. to me it is perfection. i had a record of the soundtrack to this movie, for years. now i can no longer play lp's so the dvd is for me. i think this movie and the music are far superior to the music they are producing these days. if i were young i undoubtedly would see it different but i'm not. this is truly one of the great movies of our time. its the music that makes it so great. as you can see, i recommend it very highly."
5,Entertaing film adaptation of the classic broadway musical,"A triumphant transfer of the hugely successful Rodgers and Hammerstein broadway musical to the cinema screen. This was probably the best film version of a broadway musical until ""The Sound Of Music"" came along several years later. After all these years, it continues to entertain all who see it."
5,STILL A MAGNIFICIENT FILM!,"I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AT THE EXCELLENT COLOR, GORGEOUS OUTDOOR SCENES AND A TERRIFIC CAST ... ESPECIALLY MITZI GAYNOR WHO, IN MY ESTIMATION, IS FAR BETTER THAN MARY MARTIN. I'VE READ THAT SOME CRITICS DID NOT AGREE BUT I FOUND MITZI SIMPLY DELIGHTFUL. I ALSO READ IN ANOTHER REVIEW HERE THAT ELIZABETH TAYLOR WAS CONSIDERED FOR THE PART OF NELLIE. OH MY GOD, I CANNOT CONCEIVE HER IN THIS PART ... WOULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS! THIS FILM IS WELL WORTH YOUR TIME AND, OF COURSE, THE MUSIC THRILLING. TOO BAD THAT HOLLYWOOD IS NO LONGER CAPABLE OF MAKING FILMS LIKE SOUTH PACIFIC. THE STUFF NOW COMING OUT OF HOLLYWOOD IS NOT IN MY TASTE WHATSOEVER."
4,"It's sad, but excellently played by the actors and actresses",It's a sad film.But a good plot line. It climbs the climax dazzingly. It's a romantic film. A great movie to watch at night with your family.
3,read the book even if you don't like the movie,"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYEvidentally, Michener did not like the film version of his book. Who can blame him? In this movie, WWII is reduced to a bunch of horny, drunken sailors singing, dancing, carousing, black marketing, drinking, and talking their way into oblivion. The written version captures the day to day realities of WW II in the Pacific. Read the book.Tales of the south Pacific"
1,South Pacific with two disc's number one in it,"I received the South Pacific dvd for christmas gift and it had two disc's in it but they were both disc number one, so I did not want to tell the person I got it from about it, so I ordered another one from amazon, it came today and we set down to watch disc number two and was disc number one. you are sending out south pacific with both disc's the number one I would like to have South pacific with both one and two in it. It is marked number two but it isn't. Please send me the right one with both disc number one and two in it, but they are marked one and two. maybe others have had this problem. thank you"
5,Great old movie!,"Just saw a stage production of South Pacific, so had to see the movie again - was not disappointed. Thanks for speedy delivery."
3,Be aware of degraded version on DVD,"We enjoyed watching this DVD. However, we watched the ""Extended..."" version which had sections in which the color was degraded as if it were made from an old film version that was faded. There is another version on the DVD that appeared to have the color either restored or otherwise produced with good color (we just reviewed sections that were poor on the other version, but were good in this version). We have not watched all the information on the DVD, e.g., Music Only. At least one of the songs ""This Nearly was Mine,"" does not have the complete words that are included in some sheet music or onstage productions such as that by Paulo Szot as shown on YouTube."
3,Outh Pacific-Gone through a heat,"This should have been a really wonderful experience seeing this movie after such a long time but anyone could see the quality of the DVD is terrible;it skipped,the music dragged and generally the quality of this movie was terrible. It appears to have gone through a temperature extreme- heat or something. I cannot send it back without paying some fee and it is not fully viewable. South Pacific is a wonderful work of art but you cannot tell from this DVD. Furtheremore, I did not know it was done in widescreen-it did not say this in the description."
2,OK movie marred by inferior video quality,"Joshua Logan's ""South Pacific"" is moderately entertaining and a reasonably accurate rendition of the stage version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's hit musical. The movie is hardly energetic, but does try to remain faithful to the original, including some awful dialogue, but also including the courageous theme of interracial love and marriage. Mitzi Gaynor and Rossano Brazzi are adequate but lackluster in the principal parts. The use of color filters to underscore the musical numbers gradually becomes annoying, and doesn't add anything to the presentation. This is still a great movie to have, especially if you're a musical buff. The biggest disappointment (for the DVD version) was the second-rate video quality that seems to be present on all of Fox's classic R&H musicals, like ""The King & I"" and ""Oklahoma"". It's just too soft and poorly focussed. (They're probably using an inferior source for the digital transfer.)"
2,ALL THIS AND WORLD WAR II,"I'm gonna wash this film right out of my mind. It is long and it is dull. Deadly so. There is a scene in the beginning that introduces the character of Bloody Mary that defies all logic of reshooting. Mitzi Gaynor in the lead is a pixie in search of a Gidget movie although her sexy ""Wonderful Guy"" bit on the beach is one of the film's few redeeming moments. But it just never clicks, like a tired wave lapping against a shore, it goes on and on. When it ended, I felt like I passed an endurance test."
2,I don't like the songs.,"This may be a classic musical but I don't like watching it and I like the songs even less. I do like Sound of Music but the visuals, the actors and the music of South Pacific turn me off. They should remake this storyline about the US Navy in the South Pacific during WW2 because it IS a good idea. But I have never liked hearing the songs. This movie just makes me want to see Operation Petticoat and Mr. Roberts (which always makes me cry.)"
1,Painful to watch,"We purchased this movie because our teenage son was singing a song from the movie for a competition. We found it too painful to watch the whole movie. It's cheesy and terribly dated. We love musicals and have a list of many that we are happy to watch over and over again, but this one will not be added to that list!"
2,A little too preachy for me,"I found the book to be a little too preachy about vegetarianism; I think the author is quite proud of being a vegetarian, and he hits on that point quite a bit.I really didn't feel that inspired about what animals can teach us about tolerance or friendship, either.I grew up on a farm, and have seen firsthand how ""tolerant"" and ""friendly"" animals can be towards each other. I guess that I am just a little too realistic to believe in a beautiful co-existence with nature; I feel that nature is nature, and will do its best to exist, no matter whose expense is taken."
2,Not Exactly Dorothy Parker!,"This book contains some interesting feng shui advice that you won't find anywhere else. However, the author's annoyingly cutesy style makes for very tough going. What can you say about chapter sections entitled ""Ch'i Wiz!"" and ""Just a Spent Fuel Rod in the Toxic Waste Dump of Love?""? At times I felt like groaning out loud."
4,Straightforward and fun!,"This book introduced me to the feng shui philosophy -- and now I'm obsessed with it (in a good way). This book is very well organized and caters to the person new to practicing feng shui. The writer seems a little cooky at times (saying putting a bowl of water in the moonlight for 3 hours and then putting it under your bed will make you more fertile) but for the most part, the ideas and suggestions put forth in the book are completely practical, and can make the process of de-cluttering your home seem like a lot of fun!"
4,Not bad!,"This book really could use some photos! Several things the author writes doesn't seem to fit with the standard Feng Shui theory, like using the color purple for increasing wealth. Most books say to use the colors red and gold with green and purple accents.However, some of what she says really seems to work, it's a bit strange how that works."
5,Fabulous!,"This book was the most helpful one I've read so far. The nine week one, mentioned above, is a bit intense(chanting and so forth)""Feng Shui for Dummies"" is ,ok,but nothing to write home about. By far this is the most usable."
1,The worst book on Feng Shui ever written,"For most serious Feng Shui learners, students and Consultants, this book represent the summary of all false folk beliefs related to Feng Shui. Its author comes from Black Hat Sect, a New Age Feng Shui School born in 70's last Century. It is not Traditional Chinese Feng Shui at all.The book is full of wierd advises, written in such manner that may lead readers to believe Feng Shui is some kind of Spiritual Decoration, mixed with chinese superstition and New Age beliefs.Don`t waste your money on this book.There are a lot of serious books on Feng Shui. See Eva Wong, David Twicken, Larry Sang, Kartar Diamond`s books."
5,Great Book...Easy to Follow,Loved this book. I enjoyed Karen's humor and ease of suggestions. I have added purple drawer liners in my prosperity corner and my finances have recently eased. I need to review the romance section as my romance life has begun to clutter. Great book with easy to follow instructions/suggestions.
2,Not the best for a begginer,"I won't say this book is bad, it just is not for someone just learning about Feng Shui. It is very technical and honestly if you do not know much about Feng Shui, you won't want to after reading this book. The author suggest placement of weird object in all sorts of crazy places. If do not already have anxiety about bad mojo, you will after read this book.I think some of the things in this book have merit, however I would recommend ""Clearing your Clutter, with Feng Shui before I would recommend this book. After reading all of the reviews I did not think I would be only rating it two stars."
5,Rave Reviews for this book,"I LOVED this book, and I am having so much fun with this, I have completely redecorated my home, using mostly stuff I already had, and all my friends are commenting ""What have you done?"" ""It feels different in here"" and ""Everything seems to flow better"". I hung a cutglass windchime in my missing ""family"" space to energize the space as recommended, and within minutes my youngest daughter called me. Amazing! And so much FUN! Now I am waiting for my romance energy to imporove!"
3,"Good for what it is, but not fung shui.","i have to say, i really did enjoy this book. It's fun to read and Karen Rauch Carter has a chatty, welcoming style of writing. However, real fung shui is an antient, precise and mathmatical science that involes a lot more then these...well...fluffy new-agie type fung shui books offer. As a book about changing the energy in your house and in your life, i think it's fine--great, even...but as for real fun shui...well, it's not. i guess it all depends on what you are really looking for."
1,It makes a mockery of feng shui!,Not the real feng shui -----could do a lot more harm than good. Don't waste your money! Use the compass method instead---it makes a lot more sense than this mumbo jumbo.
4,Very easy to read,Haven't had the time to finish it but so far very good and easy to read and understand. Can't wait to finish it!
4,Tie a red ribbon around that ole drain pipe!,"I picked up this book on vacation, read it on the plane and feng shuied my entire house within a day and a half of getting home. Three weeks later I got a $7000 raise. Of course, a lot of hard work went into getting that raise, but that large sum at one time is virtually unheard of in my company. I have to think those red ribbons aound my plumbing had something to do with it! (And the fact that I have a purple ""Prosperity"" bathroom)!Loved this book. Quick read, easy to understand and very easy to incorporate into my lifestyle. This book is my new ""housewarming"" gift for my friends and family. Worth the money!"
5,Fun and easy to use feng shui,"I've read lots of feng shui books and articles and Move Your Stuff is one of the best of the lot. The information is very solid and accurate; it's easy to access solutions and ideas. I discovered some new ""cures"" and learned that I was using an incorrect approach in one area that I will correct this weekend!I also love her tongue-in-cheek style of writing and ability to present information in a humorous fashion at the same time as taking her subject seriously. The only feng shui practicioner I've read who can see the humor is this art.I am a practicing Christian and there is nothing in this book that offends my spiritual or religious sensibilities.Only criticism - I'd like a list of references.A must for any amatuer practioners of feng shui or anyone who wants to make some real life changes in the millennium! I just bought a second copy to give to my brother."
1,Not what I expected,"This book was written for mass media, not for people serious about Feng Shui. The tone of the book is childish with corny jokes thrown in frequently. Feng Shui is about the ancient art of placement to become more in tune with the universe. The author of this book treats Feng Shui almost as a magic act to get what you want. In addition to being written in a disrespectful manner, many important aspects of Feng Shui were omitted from the text. Many other reviews of this book are from people stating this is the first book on Feng Shui they understand. Perhaps this is because so many aspects of Feng Shui were not even mentioned in this book. My advice is - try another book on Feng Shui. It may be a little harder to understand, just study harder or hire a Feng Shui consultant to help you."
5,Easy to understand,"This is very easy to understand and very entertaining. I tried the techniques and after I worked on my prosperity corner I received an unexpected but welcome check. There are many types of Feng Shui and many don't acknowledge Black Hat, but for me this is the most reasonable. Most of the other forms are just not feasible in the way we live today. This book is well worth the money."
4,Feng Shui Newby,"I really liked this book. I thought it was entertaining as well as educational. It read like a novel while teaching me how to balance my stuff. I really liked the part about affirmation in the back. I believe the affirmations should probably be read before you start moving your stuff around, that way when you place stuff and say your affirmations at the same time, it makes the placement that more meaningful for you and your intentions."
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought this book thinking, from the reviews I read here, that this book would be an easy approach to Feng Shui BUT I was disappointed. This is Black Hat Feng Shui. If you want to believe that the far left corner of your home is the WEALTH corner then you are in for some major disappointments. I think that 1500 years of Compass and Form Feng Shui makes more sense. Each direction of the house represents an element. This book has it all backwards."
3,Preliminary review,"I have only read about the some of the changes that one should perform in order to better your life, so I can only give a short review...seems like the author's ideas will work, so I will keep trying and expect good things to happen."
3,Move your stuff,"The stuff that you wrote are interesting vut are contradictory to the the writings of other authors especially the Chinese authors. The directions in the bagua particularly is totally opposite the directions givrn by Webster and Too. As I understand your orientation begins with the door entrance and as you look forward will always be the North side. In Webster boo, he mentioned the as you enter the front door, the opposit side to the door is the Li area and it is the South Side. It confused me to no end and even if I was interested in following your suggestions; I tried to slow down until I really get the right information. It posted a question in my mind- if its better to follow an authentic chinese method thru a chinese author."
2,It's all the same,"I was incredibly disappointed with this album. Every song sounds the same and Anders' song craft feels underdeveloped and amateurish. I am always on the look out for new female voices, and was excited to hear PJ Harvey had produced this album. It does not deserve the hype it is getting. If you like atmospheric Mazzy Star before they knew how to write songs, this album is for you. Otherwise, there are plenty of artists out there who are better--save your money."
3,"personally, i LIKE this album","it's nothing new. it's nothing terribly original. but it's enjoyable.your fairly stereotypical folk female musician, but backed by producer (and multi-instrumentalist) PJ Harvey. Peej plays instruments on all of the tracks and does back up vocals on a couple as well.Tiffany's voice is unique. and it's not something everyone's going to like, but if female folk musicians are something you enjoy, then i recommend this CD."
1,Dying cats,"Perhaps I need to listent o it for a 5th time, perhaps I need to get my ears checked, or perhaps, to me this CD sounded like someone was torturing cats to mellow background music. Her voice sounded like draging rusty nails down a blackboard. This is my opinion however."
4,"great listening, great cause","I really enjoyed this cd set. I had purchased it for my sister-in-law who is from Burma, however someone else had already bought it for her. It's a great mix of music."
5,Top CD,This cd is a must have if you are a Temprees Fan! Transaction was excellent and will gladly purchase from seller again!
3,It's okay,"The title song is almost worth the purchase, but their ""3"" album is the best, and of course it's not released on cd yet."
1,Boring.,"This author managed to get a grade-school type exercise in creative writing published. I am a cat lover, but this is just to the extreme. My young cat loving niece wants to be a chef, and I can't imagine this holding her attention for more than the first few pages."
3,"Not bad, but it would have been better played straight","Scarecrow a number of things to like in it. The colorful lighting and cinematography pay a reverential nod to Dario Argento, and scream queen Tiffany Shepis is always nice to see, but the film would have been better if the scenes with the Scarecrow had been played straighter and not been so jokey with the kills. That said, Scarecrow is a competent little B-flick with a few fine performances, most notably from the aforementioned Shepis and Richard Elfman, in a dual role as Sheriff Patterson and the redneck named Hewitt."
2,Too cheap to be good but not too bad,The movie was grade Z budget. They used that junky digital camera stuff to make it. I rented it because it had a cool cover but when I saw the first few seconds and saw how cheap it was I almost shut it off. But I didn't and was strangely entertained by it. The last half hour was dumb but if they had a budget and a little more talent this movie might have been pretty good. The Scarecrow looked cool though.
2,"Good idea, poor execution","I really wanted to be able to enjoy this flick, but alas, no such joy. The concept generally includes the outcast kid who is obviously picked on by everyone, dies, and somehow inhabits the body of a scarecrow, and thereby wreak havoc on all who wronged him. Fun idea. Sadly, though, the execution was very week. Its obviously low budget, which is not bad per se, but with the low budget comes poor directing - lots of very empty filler camera shots that go nowhere. But then the scarecrow goes very ninja - weird. Worth a rental, but that's it."
1,Don't Blame Tiffany Shepis...,"Alright, this entire movie is indeed a disaster. The ""kid"" Lester, is awful, as is the rest of the cast. That is, except for Tiffany Shepis. She is not only beautiful, but quite good and believable in her role as Lester's only hope of ever having a friend. Unfortunately, the rest of this movie is tedious and dull to the extreme! You'd think that a vengeful, acrobatic, wise-cracking scarecrow would at least be good for some laughs. Alas, he's just as bad as the rest of this torturous pile of dog brownies! Oh well, don't say I didn't warn you..."
2,another scarecrow flick,"don't think i've ever been real impressed by any of the scarecrow films even though there's only like 4 or 5 of em. they must be hard to make. this movie tried wayy to hard, the scarecrow tried to have a personality like freddie krueger but was more ridiculous than anything. was fairly entertaining and had a few cool death scenes but other than that i can't say i highly recommend this movie."
1,"yea, its pretty bad","This reminded me of the toxic avenger, however, it wasnt even that good! beyond B movie! bad qaulity, bad editing, bad acting, bad FX, really really bad lines (although what is really sad was some of the lines where the best part of the movie)note: to the guy that said all horror movies are bad, and compare them to this one: your nutz! this is way down near the bottom of the barrel for horror movies. Try hellraiser 1 or 2, Friday 13th parts 1-3, nightmare on elm st 1-3 (I could keep going, but you all get the point)"
3,Bad but good in a way,"Okay, there's not much that I can say that every other reviewer has said thus far. True it's badly acted and written but on the other hand the story is good, or at least the concept anyways. They spent some time on the scarecrow costume so the finished product looks great. Anyways, if you are a fan of cheesy horror movies (and who isn't?) at least watch it once, or add it to your collection like I did. It's good for a laugh and/or a cheap thrill, (not to mention your own Mystery Science Theatre impersonation)."
2,Behind the scenes!,"Look at the cover of the movie, does this actually look like a good movie? Well I was going to give it a one but the behind the sceens is the most funniest thing I have ever seen! When that french dude is talking he just says the funniest things. Why couldn't they make a movie about this dude? That would be something to see. The best part is in the end where he is all like ""sometimes life is like a b**** and then other times is f***ing rips!"" What? ha ha ha ha ha ha"
2,not to bad,"this movie isnt all that bad i would recommend just renting it and saving a little money instead of buying to watch one time, then hide it so you dont get mad at yourself for spending 15 bucks on it.ill say one thing about the movie, if you're wanting to buy a SCARY movie then dont buy this one!!"
3,Reprint of a Useful but Dated Work,"This is a reissue of a book that I first read in the late sixties and it was old then. There have been many weighty works on the life and times of Villa produced since. The main advantage of this one is that when it was written the author was able to interview a lot of old timers who had known Villa. The only contempories of his still living were children then. Since the book is rather popular in character and not a scholarly work, it can be read with pleasure but only the completist and the specialist collector need it. I would recommend John S.D. Eisenhower and others that I have reviewed here as much more historically sound. On the other hand the Recent Book by Fredrich Katz is more than the average curious reader will want to read. Even as a specialist I found it more useful as a reference than as a straight through read."
2,Ultimate boredom,What we hear again is the same western-like melodies performed in an oriental way and sang by a bad voice.Mikis Theodorakis is a rather good composer of folk melodies but his attempt to make classical music or sing famous poets are a complete failure.What a pity for the popular composer of Zorbas and so many other tourist songs!
3,Just something!,"This was just a dvd that I thought I just see, no big deal, just a movie to catch because of the actors."
3,Not as much hold as I remember,This mousse provides a moderate amount of hold with movement by early afternoon all the hold is gone. The smell is okay but not particularly pleasing. I think I'll try something else next time.
2,I was disappointed. Most of the ideas were impractical.,"I was disappointed with this book. Yes, it does have lots of reward ideas (I tried counting them but only got to around half of the advertised 1001 ideas). What really disappointed me, however, was that most of them required a fairly large expenditure. I work for a small company (under 100 employees) and in a tight economic environment, we just don't have the funds to be sending people to Hawaii or some of the other *big* rewards in this book. I needed something that recommended inexpensive reward options. This book was not it. (I did find another one listed on Amazon that advertises it has ""101 ways to reward team members for $20 or less"" -- I think that might suit me better. I'm going to buy that one next and see if it suits my situation any better.)"
5,The Benchmark In Understanding Rewards,"Bob Nelson and Ken Blanchard have established the benchmark in reference works for understanding the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards and how to use them. This is a 'must have' resource for managers charged with optimizing employee performance. And, if you're inclination, whenever there's a problem, is to throw money at it, think again. You're probably wasting resources and missing the mark. This work will get you to realize there are other ways to recognize employees who are achieving desired outcomes and more ways to incent those who are needing encouragement."
4,A definite read for Managers/Supervisors on a budget,"This book is full of great ideas to show appreciation without spending a lot of money. Some very simple ways to say ""thank you""."
3,Employee Motivator...OK,I've enjoyed getting ideas on how to reward/motivate my team...time will tell if they work...I'm striving for continued success!
3,1001 Ways to Reward,"Hi there,The above mentioned book is a good deal for anyone who is just beginning to get into the subject matter of rewarding employees. There are oodles of good tips that a wide variety of HR Managers, Managers in general, supervisors but also top management and every employee can get something out of."
5,1001 Ways to Reward Employees,"User friendly, Great examples, works well in group discussions. If you want to examine your organization's recognition and rewards program this is an excellent source."
3,Oaky book if you need to new ideas,"I read this book because it was recommended to me by an instructor. I thought it was okay. Many of the ideas and recommendations are common sense, however. If you lack creativity, purchase the book. But if you have a good management team, you can generate just as many useful methods for rewarding your employees as this book does."
3,"Good ""idea"" book, but does not address corporate cultures.","I bought this book and its companion, ""1001...Energise Employees"". The ideas in them are creative and fun, but in the wrong corporate culture would get chewed to pieces. These are good reference materials, but I would not characterize them as a panacea for all companies."
3,Lots of Ideas,Very good book with lots of ideas. Some ideas are not feasible but suggests many ideas to use to reward and motivate employees.
4,Great litte ideas to do,"Cute book to read and compare what other organizations do. Unfortunately, most are not very practical or do not seem as effective as they can be, so the majority of their ideas are useless. Still, you can find some gems in certain sections."
3,Decent ideas,This book has a lot of ideas on how to reward employees. Most of them only seem possible at larger companies or with the right type of people. Still worth reading for ideas.
3,"Not original, but good if you're looking for a lot of ideas in one place.","This book is a detailed listing of great ideas for rewarding and recognizing employees for a variety of reasons. If you're looking for esoteric and insightful discussions, look elsewhere. But a good book when you want to find a different reward."
1,This is a book for morons,very sad book attempting to manipulate employees with the most pathetic ploys.
4,Some fine piano playing,Interesting collection of tunes to keep your toes tapping. Fun to listen to and daydream about where you might be when he plays.
3,"good enough, was hoping for clearer readings","You can figure out your pH with this product but sometimes the color is splotchy and in between the numbers. It does the job well enough to know my salivas pH which is what I wanted. I liked that you could rip off what you needed instead of having pre-cut strips, but it doesn't rip that easily. I might buy this again but I am going to try another one and compare before purchasing this brand again."
4,super tiny,The picture is very deceiving on this product only because there isnt anything to compare its size to. the container that holds the roll is about the size of a fifty cent piece. you can use a smaller piece of the tape then it recommends but if you are doing the urine test i recommend wearing gloves since the tape is like tissue paper and the urine travels quickly!
3,"Works, but Overpriced.","The product works as advertised, but come on [...] (cost+shipping) for a roll of PH test strips that probably cost about [...] to make. Yes I purchased it, for health reasons as I was unable to find it locally in the time frame that I needed.Would I purchase it again for [...], forget it... There has to be a cheaper option."
1,Accuracy in doubt,"The Dispenser Ph Test Strips tested my Saliva at 6.4 PH and the same 6.4 for my Urine, and also tested 6.4 for Deer Park bottled water, my NC tap (deep well) water, and the tap water at my 2nd residence in KY. I also purchased pHion Diagnostic pH Test Strips which measured my Saliva PH as 7.5, Deer Park bottled water 6.0, and my NC tap water 7.0. I believe the pHion strips are much more accurate than the Ph Test Strips Dispenser."
4,Good,"My only misgiving towards this product is that it isn't idiot-proof. I find it difficult, due to 'user interface error'. Works though."
3,Valuable product for testing purposes.,"Haven't used this product yet, but glad to find it here, since drug stores either didn't know what I was talking about or didn't carry it."
4,"Nice, but much larger than expected","This robe hook is nicely finished and attractive, and it has a quality look, but it is much larger than what I expected. The outside measurement between the two prongs is 3 and 3/4 Inches, and the hook extends nearly 4 inches from the door. It's a big thing. Still, I am happy with the purchase."
3,"Looks great, but loose","Followed directions and put up this hook. It fits tightly to the door I put it on, but the two hooks were hard to get tight. Tried and tried to make it not wiggle. Why does it have to come in 3-4 parts? It would have been so much easier to put up if it were less parts. Still moves a little even after I modified it a bit."
5,Attractive Delta Robe Hook in Bronze,"Delta Faucet 75035-RB Victoria, Robe Hook in Bronze. When we purchased a new kitchen faucet 6 years ago, it came with this free robe hook, which we installed on the cabinet next to the kitchen sink, on which to hang our kitchen towels. I actually sewed loops (of bias tape) in the center of each of my towels, so they would not slide off the hook. When I decided we could use a towel (robe) hook on the cabinet on the other side of the sink, I search Amazon. I didn't really want to pay $23.63 for it, but heck the first one was free, and I had enough items to get FREE SHIPPING!The bronze towel hooks do their job and are a nice compliment to the bronze kitchen faucet. I highly recommend this for hanging a towel or robe with a loop on it."
4,Much better than given credit for.,"I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by how good this movie was. The characters had just enough quirk to make them interesting, especially Vincent Ventresca as Marshal, who stole the show during his on-screen time.My only problem with this movie was that there were times were things were progressing way too fast. This is most prevalent in the begining of the movie. But as soon as the introductions are over, the flow begins to fall into place nicely.I recomend this movie for those looking for an interesting indepenent film starring some great, up and coming actors."
2,Criminally Stupid,"Stupid criminals hook up with stupid record exec who thinks he can use them to further his evil plans to create a mall&#65533;er &#65533;entertainment center&#65533; by ousting a nice old guy from his variety store. Due to a bribe sting, some very stupid FBI agents instigate a shoot out in a crowed club, causing the death of untold innocent bystanders. I&#65533;ve learned one thing from all of this: The FBI REALLY HATES SHOPPING MALLS.The true break out in this film is Vincent Ventresca. He has the ability to take any role make it fascinating. He&#65533;s intelligent thought in motion. I&#65533;d watch this guy read the phone book. Five Stars for Ventresca!"
1,Terrible!,"My freind was a fan of Carmine Giovinazzo, and although he's good, the direction and storyline of this movie just seemed impossible to work with... I understand that Eric Schwab is a begining director / writer , but gosh... I mean, you'd think other people would watch the dailys and recomend a few things! Perhaps a plot would help! I'm just upset that my freind actually bought this DVD from Amazon...."
2,A nice film with fresh faces,"Eric Schwab, the finest up and coming director in Hollywood, puts out an ok film on a relatively low budget. The actors are some of the newest in Hollywood (You can tell). The film didn't get many viewers in theaters because it came out the week of 9/11 but the professional reviews at that time were mostly unfavorable. I can see why."
4,Make a wish and make your birthday magical!,"Abby's Lucky Thirteen is an okay book. It's about when Abby turns thirteen and in her religion's belief, turning into a young woman. Abby wants to show everyone that she can take responsibility. When a test comes up in school, Abby buys a study guide from a boy, which later on, she discovers is the cheating sheet with all the answers on it. Abby doesn't know what to do, so she copies off of it. But when five people get the exact same answer, the teacher wants an answer. Abby doesn't want to say anything and neither does anyone else. So the teacher suspends them from school! Abby doesn't want her family and friends to know that, so she lies to her friends and won't even tell her own mother! This birthday is turning into a disaster. Can she fix it? Join in, in this exciting book, and find out!"
4,better than I thought it would be,"This book was better than I thought it would be. It dragged on in some parts, and it isn't a book that I would read over and over again, but all in all, it was pretty good."
4,"She is like an arvage 13 year old, but worse!",I really liked this book because for me it was like reading about my life only it was worse. While her and her twin sister are preparing for their Jewish entro into adult life Abby gets suspended for cheating on her math test!
1,Don't waste your time & money on this book!!!!!,"I HATED this book. As many of the Baby-Sitters' Club books, the author has tried to portray a real-life problem, and distorted it so extensively that I was appalled that she would want teenage girls to be influenced by it. I'm sure many minds have been warped by Baby-sitters' Club books, and I find it to be horrible that an author would choose to stereotype teenage girls as she does.Shame!"
4,a very serious pianist,"except for ron carter replacing bob cranshaw on bass, the personnel here is the same as on david henderson's inner urge. what seemed like a quiet conspiracy between tyner and jones on inner urge becomes a ruling empire by the two on the real mccoy.all the selections were written by tyner. his playing is no less than brilliant. he plays with focus and such virtuosity that on passion dance it sounds like two pianos are playing at the same time.jones' drumming dominates behind the piano. joe henderson seems to have been invited just for the ride. he gets a chance to stretch on four by five where he explores different registers. this isn't henderson's best recording. but not his fault, tyner doesn't write well for sax players."
2,Disappointing DVD transfer,"This movie is one of my favorites. That is why I was very disappointed with the DVD transfer. I wonder if any one else has noticed the distracting and discernible changes in the color in the scene where Maria first meets Captain Von Trapp, which detracted from my enjoyment of the movie. Was this present in the original film? I expected better from a DVD which is THX certified."
5,Fox Home Video hits the jackpot with the Blu-Ray Sound of Music,"I've seen a lot of great Blu-Ray discs, but the Sound Of Music tops them all! The picture quality and sound are so fantastic, it's like seeing it as a brand new 2011 film in the movie theater. It's hard to believe this film was made in 1964! It's that good!On top of that, there are literally hours of bonus features to keep you busy for a long, long time!Fox Home Video should be exremely proud of the work they have done here. Blu-Ray was made for movies like this!"
5,A great film that has stood the test of time,This is one of my all-time favorite films. There are a lot of people out there who would agree. These are people of both genders and all ages. The DVD is very clear and the extra bonus material just makes the experience of the whole thing richer. I love it and highly reccomend. It is also a great value.
5,"One of MY ""Favorite Things""","Forget the schnitzel with noodles and wild geese...Buy this DVD!!! Julie has never looked or sounded better. Anyone who's ever loved the movie before will love it even more in Blu-ray. Sing with the nuns, dance in a gazebo in the rain, wear some old curtains (hey, it worked for Scarlett!)Remember and ENJOY."
5,necessity,I had to get this dvd to replace another. I've always enjoyed the movie. Fast service and dvd is quality. I'm satisfied Thanks.
5,Ottimo cofanetto,"Non si prende questo cofanetto per vedersi solo il film (tra l'altro manca la lingua italiana), ma per collezionare uno dei più bei film di tutti i tempi...Ottimo cofanetto, non manca niente, bluray, dvd, cd colonna sonora, card, certificato, carillon...Ottimo acquisto, soprattotto se lo trovate in offerta... ;) ;) ;)"
5,Sound of Music DVD,"THis was a Christmas gift, so I don't know the quality of DVD. Was sent in a timely manner and purchase of DVD was flawless. Thanks"
3,Sound Musical,"The Sound Of Music is both loved and reviled by critics and fans alike. Those who hate it find the film cloying, overly sappy and contrived and those who love it find it a joyous celebration of love, triumph and wholesomeness. I think that movie falls someone in between. The film can be annoyingly sweet, but it is also that sweetness that gives the movie a nave charm. Julie Andrews is perfectly cast as Maria and Christopher Plummer is charming as the patriarch of the von Trapp family of whom Maria becomes the matron. The film is a tad long, but the film is perfect for family entertainment where kids will enjoy and most parents will also like it as well. The film has become something of an institution still earning screenings in the theater in most major cities. The film was, of course, a bog office bonanza in it original release and it faired quite well at the 1965 Academy Awards winning five Oscars including Best Picture and a second Best Director award for Robert Wise."
2,Incomplete Product Description!!!!,"I ordered this package since I am traveling to Salzburg this year and will see all of these sites. The extra features were intriguing to me.BEWARE - only a very few of them are on the DVD!!!!! Most, including commentaries, making of, real VonTrapp family are on the Blu-ray ONLY. I called SONY and they said ""sorry, read the box"", which I did AFTER it arrived. When I called Amazon, they agreed that the product description did not convey the differences, but stated that I should have known by the number of Blu-rays and DVDs pictured that I would not get all of the special features on DVD.VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
2,The Spanish Audio is horrible :(,"This is one of my favorite movies, I love the plot, the music, and the beautiful places. However, if you want to watch in Spanish like do DON'T BUY IT. I had the regular DVD for years and the Spanish version in that one is great, but in this blue ray the Spanish Audio is just awful. The audio doesn't go with the lips of people talking, the songs are cut off in many parts, it is horrible. I do like however the commentaries and all the extra information about behind the scenes and the real Maria."
5,one of my ' favorite things',"do-re-me-far-so-la-te-do. can't stop singing praises for this remasted copy of one of my favorite movies.need i say more, this blu ray is really fantastic.made me wish i was Austrian by the time the movie was done.get it now!!!"
4,all time classic must have video,"This is a truly great movie . The music, the scenery as well as the story are top notch. A MUST for all movie collections."
4,smile,Had to wait for a while for product due to it being out of stock but it eventually came. Was very happy with it.
3,Sub par for large screen,"After reading other reviews that said you could see individual blades of grass on the Blu-ray version, I decided to purchase this. I have a 55 inch Sony HD TV that has an excellent picture. Playing this in a Sony Blu-ray player, connected by HDMI, I expected to have a crisp picture also. Sadly disappointed. Maybe it would be all right on a 42"" screen but on a 55"" screen the picture is very grainy."
5,Love this movie!!!,Great classic...I watched this all the time as a kid and this version has awesome color and sound. Highly recommend.
5,Perfect Family Movie for a Wide Screen TV!!!,"Since wide screen television sets were introduced for use in homes, I have looked for the perfect family movie for a wide screen TV. The blue ray version of The Sound of Music is the perfect family film for a wide screen television set. From the outstanding panorama shot of the Alps at the beginning of the movie to the end, this blue ray transfer shines. This 3 disc present station includes a wealth of extras.Enjoy !"
2,the hills are alive with the sound of vomit,"when i was a child my mom forced me to watch this movie. I hated it then and i hate it now. the only thing that is watchable is the beautiful scenery, but i can catch that on the discovery channel. if the producers had required julie to sing with a sock in her mouth, or had the music of spinal tap inm the background, the movie would have been first rate entertainment. seeing this movie has drstically ;degressed the quality of my life"
1,"Open, old copy that will not play.","The children and I were very excited to finally receive this in the mail. Unfortunately, upon opening the mail sleeve, we discovered that the Blu-ray packaging had been previously opened.1). This was a returned Blu-ray movie sold as new at full price.The kids did not care as they really wanted to see the movie. Then we discovered why it was returned:2). It will not play(even with updated firmware and another Blu-ray player).Hopefully, when one orders new movies from Amazon, one will receive the new movies that were purchased in good faith - not previously purchased, malfunctioning ones.Shame on Amazon for selling previously owned movies that will not play - as ones that are new.Addendum: NorAm International Partners, Inc. sold this for Amazon. Be wary of purchasing from this group."
1,Scratched Disk,I ordered a used CD of the Sound of Music. What I got was a copied disk that was unuseable. Notified the seller but got no response. Not too happy
5,An exellent for people of all ages!,This movie is excellent. It was very well written and held my attention all the way through. I've seen it many times adn I still enjoy watching it. I think it shows that it's not always easy to find God's will for your life. It also shows that sometimes you have to do things that you may not like doing to find out if that is what God wants for your life or not.
3,"Good product, bad package","I got this as a gift for my mother on Mother's Day, and while the product itself was great. (She loved all of the various extras it came with - books, music box, music soundtrack, etc.) the actual blue velvet box it came in was badly damaged upon arrival. Since I had ordered this just over a month ago and didn't open it (since it was a gift for someone else), the return window had already closed, and Amazon will not let me exchange the item for an undamaged one. It's not amazon's fault that the box was damaged as their shipping box was in good condition, but the damaged interior product made for a lackluster presentation of a gift to my mom on Mother's Day. So just be careful when ordering this product. (Otherwise it's a great gift for anyone who is a fan of The Sound of Music.)"
5,For use in Czech Republic,This was purchased for a gift to someone in Prague and we find out that their system will not permit them to play the DVD. Is there an other way to get this to play European style?
5,A wonderful experience,"The DVD package was great-six hours of Sound of Music! Excellent reproduction of the original film, interview with the cast today was the most interesting,"
5,One of the best film in history,"The Sound Of Music is one of the best musical dramas ever. Julie Andrews as Maria is an extremely lovable character. The story is perfect and the musics are memorable(not to mention the characters). And even though it has aged considerably, it has never loose it's impact and still manage to be warm and touching. There was never a single dull moment in the film. It truly deserves the Academy Award for Best Picture. The picture quality on DVD is so effectively remastered, you can be fooled into thinking it was filmed last year. As for the sound, the Dolby Digital soundtrack is incredible especially for a film of this age. The making of documentary covers the subject of the film and the real-life Maria with perfect detail. And thanks to the isolated score i dont even need to get the soundtrack at all. If you browse the disc carefully, you will find a lot of rare materials inside. What more can i say? A near-perfect film on a near-perfect DVD. A MUST-HAVE!"
1,"DON'T DUMP YOUR OLD DISC-THIS IS NO BETTER, MAYBE WORSE!","I was able to find a copy of this ""new remastered"" version of SOUND OF MUSIC yesterday, along with OKLAHOMA. The latter is a downright disaster, while SOUND OF MUSIC, remarketed and milked for the umpteenth time is not a disaster, but a definite disappointment.High quality extras from the previous DVD were not carried over.The new extras are ""nice"", but ultimately boringThe transfer itself seems somehow fuzzier and less sharp than my old disc. I returned the new disc to the store where I bought it as ""defective"". It certainly is.AVOID THIS DISC and WAIT FOR A TRUE RESTORATION and REMASTERING!"
4,The hills are alive!!,"Love this movie and while the blu-ray is best enjoyed with current flicks and digital technology, it still looks much better than I had expected. Worthy purchase."
4,A CLASSICAL NOSTALGIA,"The remembering of this ""classical film"" 40 years after really touched me, specially when I saw a neat interest in my 10 year old girl: not only the story but the musical experience."
5,"Classical movie, full of life and sounds of good music!",This movie is classical and wonderful. It's funny and it's... I can't find the right words for this. This is wonderful. Music is something you can't forger and Julie Andrews' beautyness and great voice could move mountains. The ending is so sad!
5,Music at its Best!,"The first time i saw this film, I was delighted by the music and it's haunting lyrics escpecially of 'The Sound of Music'. It was my eldest sister who introduced me to this magically made movie and perhaps one of the best musical movie genres ever made. I recommend for those people who wanted to see this movie in DVD version because of the superb sound quality of orchestration and wonderful scenery of the film. One could easily fall in love with the music and lyrics of Rodgers and Hammerstein! and easily to get into your mind all the songs and become an instant favorite!It was indeed, Julie Andrew's trademark as Maria and she could truly be remembered as wonderful Froilan Maria (aside from her role as Mary Poppins) for seven children of the Baron Von Trapp. Christopher Plummer is dashing and handsome in this film and possessed a cool and calm voice.This is a must-have entertainment collection for the whole family for a truly 100% family entertainment. I recommend this to everyone!"
5,A CLASSIC,"This is a classic. It's hard to believe it's forty-six years old. I don't purchase many movies, but this one you'll watch again and again."
1,Sappy and Sugary,"Is it possible to contract diabetes from watching a movie? The Sound of Music comes pretty darn close! Overly sentimental pablum with unremarkable songs. Too cutesy, too long, too boring."
1,sound of music blue ray,i have 3 sound of music dvds and i purchased a new blue ray dvd i think they did a terrible job not much different than the old ones the only difference is the faces are sharper but the scenery and the beautiful mountains and back ground is no different than a vhs or the old dvd its sad such a great movie and they could t do any better
1,I'd watch Mallrats before I'd watch this again,"This movie is really borring. Don't get me wrong I like Juile Andrews, but I find her more attractive now. I could watch Princess Diaries over and over and never get bored with her. But in this movie she looked more like Sandy Dunncen, the women from Hogen Family. She was the woman that replaced Valerie Harper after there was a problem with production. I did like Valerie better then Sandy, but I find Sandy more attactive then Valerie, but I like Julie Andrews more then both of them, but I especially like the modern Julie Andrews more now then in this movie. The only person that did a good job was James Cann. He was able to provide substance to an otherwise slow moving movie. You might remember James Cann from Roolerball and the comedy Godfather. He was good as the comic relief in that movie. I hope that he can put this movie behind him and get to more productive movies like his part in Back to the Future or Alien Nation."
4,"Good Set, but Music Box sounds horrible","The title says most of what needs to be said. I loved the set. The BD/DVD is perfect. All the pictures are nice. Good quality book with a bit of interesting history. The certificate was slightly bent, but that didn't bother me. However, the music box was very, very tin-like. I was very disappointed in it. I expected it to be have a cheap snow globe-like sound to it, but it really sounded bad. The speed of the song sounded quite off as well, much faster than the movie, and the pauses were slightly off."
5,Sound of Music is Music to My Ears,"Since I was a small child, I have loved the Sound of Music. It is a delightful and entertaining movie. It is unquestionably my favorite movie. The subplots are outstanding. The music stays with you and uplifts your spirits. The children are adorable. The love story between the Captain and Maria is breath-taking. The dance scene always makes my heart beat faster. Determination and the human spirit are the forces behind this movie. The movie is time-consuming but worth it. I still wait for the movie to be released on DVD. You haven't lived a complete life without seeing ""The Sound of Music."""
5,The best movie! Why not on DVD?!,I'm very disappointed to know that this one of the greatese movie has not been released on DVD!
5,AAA,"Loved it!Don't like the requirements for commenting. Guess I won't do any more reviews. 5 more words required, enough"
5,Great Movie!,"I remember when this movie first came out. Though I didn't see it until it had been out for quite a few years, it is truly a classic."
5,Exceeds expectations,"This is what a collector's edition should be about. From the music box to the postcards, I''ll treasure this set."
3,DVD,It never said that it was a wide screen format. I was looking for one that was not and so was surprised when I got it. I think it should note all details in the front. I did not want the trouble to send it back and so did not. I feel I was tricked.
5,Good musical movie,"I've watched ""The Sound of the Music"" few times before on a laser disc, and enjoyed it vey much. This is my first time I bought it in a DVD, so I don't know how much improvement in this 40th special edition from previous versions. The picture and sound qualities are fine, and I like the sub-title feature. This helps me to understand every words that they speak. Juliet Andews' commentary is at the beginning of Disc 1, and I have to press the ""next"" key on the remote to skip to the menu screen to start the movie, I find that's quite annoying. This movie is in a wide screen, so there are black bars on both sides, top and bottom of my TV. If I enlarge it, the picture become blurry slightly. So, I watch it in a normal mode which makes my 52"" HDTV like a 46"" tv. It's still ok."
5,The Sound of Music Classic,It was fantastic to see this 60's award winning classic in such clarity and crisp sound and sight! We look forward to watching the other Blue Ray movies we have purchased.
4,"Great movie, great price!",I finally own this movie and I got it for an amazing price from amazon! I'm very happy customer. I Highly recommend this movie and amazon.
4,Is it still a classic if it looks brand new!,"Wow who knew I was missing so much of one of my favorite movies since childhood. The Blu-ray version is like seeing it for the first time, seriously. I watched both versions to see if the DVD was missing footage it's such a huge difference. I'm not switching to all Blu-ray I have too big a DVD collection but I'm totally convinced on this movie that it's better! If you love it, you need to see it at it's best. If you haven't seen it watch it on Blu-ray, it'll make you sing along."
5,WOW !,After having seen this movie too many times to count both in the theater and at home I never expected this to be such a revelatory experience. I sat through the entire film with my mouth hanging open at the clarity of the picture and sound. It was literally like I had never seen it before. I'm sure even just the DVD is far superior to the last release of this film. For anyone who is a fan this is a must. The thrill of that mountain top opening and the wedding scene brought back chills I hadn't experienced in years. The hills are alive...again !
5,My favorite Movie,What can you say about the Sound of Music that hasn't already been said? I saw it when I was six and dreamed of being Leisl - and enjoyed watching my six year old enjoy the movie. Just beautiful.
5,Something really wrong below!,"This release has been given the warmest response, particularly as to the Blu-ray remaster, the world over.Might I respectfully suggest to those who are having trouble with the reproduction, as the one below comparing the new release to VHS, that they seriously have a professional agent visit their home and explain what is wrong with their equipment!"
1,"Great Movie, but PLEASE don't watch on DVD--it's awful","I was so excited to get the 5 star collection of ""The Sound of Music"". When I did, I popped it in expecting that warm feeling but instead I found it cold and vaguely creepy. In the opening scenes, showing the Austrian hills, the scenes look so fake and cartoonish...like a video game. These scenes were actually filmed on location to get the true feeling of being there. Now, they look computer generated--in fact, I can tell some differences that have been thrown in to make everything look even more glistening. It isn't higher resolution, it's fake stuff. The warm feeling of film is gone and is replaced with harsh sound and even the faces of the characters look plastic, like robots. This is a movie best seen on VHS in Widescreen format. If they digitalized it anymore, it would look like ""The Matrix""...it almost does. I love the DVD format for most movies but this one overdoes it bigtime. It looks like a cartoon or video game."
3,I wish i could exchange in my video library,I love this movie but being in a rush I clicked on the sing-a-long version instead of the regular version for automatic streaming. Being that i bought this movie unlike an hardcopy you cannot return it. I strongly advise that you be careful before purchase. Words run across the screen and I can't do anything about it.
3,Works half the time,"I was very excited to watch the SOM in blu ray. Unfortunately the blu ray disc only works on our Sony player which is on our tv. The Panasonic connected to our theater projector couldn't play it. I have tried updating firmware but the SOM blu ray says it needs a memory card added to the player?!? Not sure what that means yet. I will be trying the recommended website soon. Hopefully that can resolve the playback problem. Otherwise it is striking and beautiful on a 46"" screen. Yes, I realize we can move the Sony but I'd rather fix the Panasonic to see it at 100+""."
3,How DO you solve a problem like Maria?,"I watched this about once a year when I was a kid, and I liked it for all the normal reasons: good tunes, a fun family, majestic scenery. But a few weeks ago I watched it with my roommate (we're both 23-year-old men) and although we were actually quite giddy initially - the ""Hills are alive"" shot is still a sugary jolt - we got pretty tired with it and could barely make it to the intermission. Is any family remotely that cute? Would the baroness stand a chance against Maria in a zillion years? Just how many teen ingenues did they have to turn down before they settled on the lifeless actress who played Liesl? She's 16 going on 17 pains in my neck. Still, it is a story you can root for, and Julie Andrews is a dear. As in doe... ou know the rest."
5,My favorite movie,"I've waited every Christmas for this movie, this Christmas my daughter saw it for the first time and loved it. It was time to own it, she watches it so much it might not be my favorite movie in a litle while. Great movie."
4,Sound of Music,Everything went well with purchase and delivery. Only one problem was the dvd had some skips in it in some of the extra content. The actual movie was all right.
5,WONDERFUL!,This is the BEST MOVIE EVER MADE! And that's the truth! I love anything with Julie Andrews in it!
2,Disappointing,"Though the DVD has some really nice extras (interviews, etc.), the restoration leaves a lot to be desired. Much clarity is lost from the original. Almost blurry, like multiple images that don't properly align (the actors all have ""zombie eyes""). Not really watchable. Now shopping for the unrestored version."
3,broken hopes,this video arrived in a broken case and has been very difficult store away...poor design quality. Too much crammed into bubble-wrapped envelope.
5,The Sound of Music,"The Splendid family movie , I have watched since I was 10 till Present, its greatest is still the same whenever I watche it."
5,This is one of MY FAVORITE THINGS.,I have loved this movie ever since I saw it in 1965. When I saw this as a Gold Box Deal I went for it and so very happy I did. I was blown away when I opened the box at the quality of the set. It looks like it should cost over a hundred dollars. The music box is the very same color and print of the drapes in Maria's room that she makes the children's play clothes from. I am enjoying the books and learning more about the real Von Trapp Family.Now for the Blu-ray oh my goodness. It is like being right there. It is full HD viewing pleasure. I already had the DVD which was really good but when you look at one then the other there is a BIG difference for sure. The sound is amazing also. This set is so worth the investment if this is a favorite of yours. I also have the Wizzard of Oz set my other favorite of all time.Highly Recommend it is worth the few extra dollars if you want a beautiful keepsake.
4,Wonderful To Watch And Listen (4.5 Stars),"I've heard about ""The Sound of Music"" most of my life, but I never really took the time to watch it until recently. Even though it's a long movie, almost 3 hours, I found it very entertaining. When Maria and Captain Von Trapp got married, I thought that was the end. But to my surprise the movie continued on with a darker note when the family escapes from the Nazis. So what started out as lighthearted and fantastical ended as scary and realistic. Even though Christopher Plummer is a very handsome man and a fine actor, I found him to be a very dull singer, but other than that ""The Sound of Music"" is a great movie"
3,Sound of Music - Online Library,"This is the first and possibly last video I will buy from Amazon for online viewing. I have tried a couple of times to view it over my broadband network and it gets hung up with Amazon trying to reconnect. Move is great, but Amazon gets a D for providing it to us."
5,The Sound of Music 45th Anniversary Blu-ray,I like see this movie. It's amazing see old movie with new transfer digital and a lot of bonus in this edition. Specially if you buy cheap. Transfer video it's excellent with perfect audio. so why you so wait .. grap it and place order for this edition
5,Fantastic - Best Movie Ever Made!,"Words cannot do justice to this movie. I have watched it on VHS, but the DVD is so much superior. We also enjoyed the 2nd disk with the background info about the actors, actresses, production, etc. This DVD is easily worth every penny. You'll be glad you own it."
5,Simply the best!,"I positively love musicals and this is the VERY BEST. Classic Rogers and Hammerstein and a PERFECT cast wrapped around a fastinating story in one of the most beautiful areas of the world, at the most interesting (if not the most distructive) time in the 20th century. What more could you ask for? I've seen all the modern musicals and they will be very hard pressed to ever top the pure, unabashed feeling this draws out of people who grew up in the time, appreciated the music and cherished the performances. It will always be my favorite."
3,dvd version problemmatic?,"While the transfer of this fine film to DVD has been long awaited, I found the DVD very disappointing due to significant skips, stalls, image distortions, and lip sink problems occuring in major scenes and songs (played on an RCA DVD player which up until now has not ever been problemmatic with DCD playbacks). Problemmatic sequences included ""Maria"", ""The Office of the Mother Abbess"", ""So Long, Farwell Reprise"". I hope this is an individual problem, would appreciate hearing if I got a bad disk or whether these are known technical flaws. Have not played this on my powerbook yet."
5,The Sound Of Music,The whole presentation is wonderful ! The picture images are so clear.The special features disc was enjoyable also.We were surprised to recieve the extra disc that can be used on regular T V along with the blue ray disc.Thanks for offering this beautiful classic.
5,the sound of music,"i always love this movie the singing and the drama of what was happing back then, and strong performence by julie andrews and christoef plummer bring it to the front. i got to see the live play past summer, incrediable performence by lady who played the mother superior. and also lady who played mother supieror in the movie singing to julie andrews,"
5,A Great DVD Package!,"Of course this is one of the best movies of all time. This is a musical that makes sense, 'cause music is so much a part of the story.The DVD version of the movie is great. I especially like getting the featurette about making the movie and the short feature about Salzburg that came with it. (Plus there are other extras). It was really interesting hearing about making the movie and about the actual Von Trappe family, which the movie is based on."
3,THE SOUND OF MUSIC /ART,"Just seen the Sound Off Music on DVD and i was expecting to see a far better picture and sound than VHS but alas i can only rate it 25%better than VHS i put the blame with fox .Its no good saying it is an old film take a look at the Ten Commandments/Gone Withe The WIND/ and Phantom of the Opera,much older films but very good transfers to DVD so i do think sound of Music desereved better and i do hope fox will treat their transfers with the art that some studios use.but i am still pleased i have a copy."
5,The Sound of Music,"What a classic! Still one of my favorite movies. How can anyone get tired of hearing Julie Andrews sing ""The Hills Are Alive"". About ten years ago I went to Salzburg, Austria. We went to all the spots from the movie. The moment I walked into the gazebo I wanted sing and dance."
2,Wide screen - hardly seen,"The Wide Screen format ruins the movie - makes it hard to see unless you have a HUGE television. For the price of the DVD, it should allow you the option of full screen if you prefer that over the wide screen format. I started watching it, and gave up. Rather see the VHS version without having to use binnoculars."
3,Sound of Music?,"This movie is pretty good for the first half. But I normally don't watch the second. I prefer it when Andrews is the nanny and becomes engaged. Other than that, I could do without the movie."
4,The Sound of Music,My son was very happy that I bought him this as a gift. The only problem I had was that the collectible box that came with it was broken. I'm sure I could have sent it in for a replacement but the videos were good and I'm really busy so going to the post office just wasn't in my schedule.
5,Sound of Music (Limited Edition Collector's Set) Blu-ray/DVD Combo,This is a real treat! I got this so fast after ordering. This seller is wonderful and I would definitely purchase from him again.
5,Julie Andrews`2nd Miracle Film,THE SOUND OF MUSIC is simply the greatest musical of the 20th century. It can be enjoyed by most people - repeatedly.... A delight.
5,Like seeing it for the first time,"I can't tell the number of times I have seen this movie. I own the 40th anniversary DVD edition and I was sure nothing could top it. Well, something has. This transfer to Blu ray is so beautiful it makes me want to cry! I'm truly seeing it for the first time! I've discovered things i didn't even know were there. Every mark etched on the walls and floors of the abby, every thread on the costumes fabric, the leaves on the trees, I could go on. People responsible for this transfer: Thank you! You've given me a new movie to enjoy and share for years to come!"
5,The sound of BD,"The sound of music on Blue-Ray disc is an excellent product, with lots of information. I bought the product expecting it to come with subtitles in Portuguese. The product description on the amazon website mentions only about English and Spanish subtitles. There are several others including portuguese to my happiness."
5,Great BluRay,"An ageless wonder with hours of extras. Just in time for Xmas. Thanks Amazon for great price, both for movie and shipping(free)."
5,Do-Re-Mi,"I have not seen the movie but my dad told me about the song ""Do-Re-Mi"" and I love it! I love the ""Doe"" a deer part!"
3,Great film but disappointing DVD transfer,"I'm talking about this 40th anniversary edition. First of, I love the film very much, and I have seen it both in the theatre and on video a million times. This DVD edition has wonderful special features on disc two which I enjoy watching immensely. But, I'm quite disappointed with the new video transfer on disc 1 of this edition. While it looks much better that the previous DVD edition released four years ago, it's not perfect. The color timing is quite wrong and they make everything looks so pastel and too blue. It looks like the whole film was shot at the exactly same time everyday, no sense of time or whatsoever. The original prints has a very atmospheric, warm and rich color balance. Where is that on this DVD. It's gone! The only good thing about it is a proper widescreen aspect ratio that allows you to enjoy the whole 70MM frame that the film originated, without panning and scanning that they did years back on VHS releases."
3,"Good musical, BUT...","I have to admit, my girlfriend likes it better than I. The scenery is breathtaking, but the musical itself is only good... NOT excellent. A far, far better musical is ""My Fair Lady"" just for sheer entertainment value. The dialogue is better, the plot is more interesting and well developed, and the lyrics are far more mature. But I do like the ""Sound of Music"" and all should have it for a wonderful family experience. ""My Fair Lady"" is better appreciated among adults..."
2,"5-star movie, 2-star blu ray for less than high resolution","The limited edition 45th anniversary collector's set purchased is disappointing. Stopped after viewing the blu ray for the first 10 minutes. Regret to have purchased this collection's set.The blu ray is less than high resolution. Most of the screens of landscape show many flickering points which are rare in blu ray. Horizontal lines all over the screen are obvious which are common only on VCDs and not normally found on DVDs, and the first time seen in blu ray.The music CD is contained in a plain paper CD holder without the track listing anywhere.The music box sounds less than 8 seconds even with a full wind and can hardly be heard if the cover was not removed."
3,"If you already own this, don't buy another","The Blu Ray is good, but if you have a good upcoverting bluray player and own this on DVD, save your money. The Blu Ray version is not so much better that you need to buy this version too. It's a great movie and one of my all time favorites. I gave it three stars because it is way over-hyped special edition that tries to get you to feel you must own this new Blu Ray version. However the difference between the DVD and Blu Ray is small. The hype is too high. If you don't own Sound of Music, then buy the Blu Ray. You'll be getting the best available version possible. If you own this on VHS tape, you may want to upgrade too. But if you own a DVD, think twice. It is really not worth the extra money."
3,could of been better,"the produvt dvd;s themselve was sealed A plus on that, howevr the music box had a corner broken off and it was glass and the chip was in the box there was some over all genral scratches in the genral case but that was a issue the issues was the chiped glass music box as far i knew it the condition was "" LIKE NEW when it should have been marked "" FAIR OR GOOD"" just beacuse the dvds was sealed it still takes away from the product over all ness if a item is damaged........................it was okay and i was satified with the product so the seller should not discredited for that in fact the seller is fine but the product marking should of been a lil more careful good is not like new!!! one thumb down.."
5,Sound of Music,I received this movie earlier than expected and it was in perfect condition. I give 5 stars to Amazon. I really appreciate the service that is given when I order through Amazon.
4,Good Digita Reproductionl,"Nice digital reproduction of this all time favorite. The colors are satisfactory. I am not sure if there were ending credits in the original, but it seems that they were omitted on this DVD."
5,Awesome!,I'm such a huge fan of The Sound of Music and Julie Andrews in particular. This is a great compilation and the mastering is awesome!
4,Sound of Music,"What a great movie. My 4 year old neice loves it and knows it word for word, song for song. I also ordered the soundtrack. Timeless."
5,Just amazing,I ordered this box set when it was on sale on Black Friday and I wasnt disappointed. The quality of the visuals are amazing and worth the price alone. The postcards and extra stuff in the box set made it really cool
4,One of My Favorite Movies,The movie quality is really good. I was able to download it and view it instantly. I will definitely use this option again.
5,Best Family Movie Ever,"It is encouraging, exciting and brings joy to the family when watching. My 7-year-old says, ""It's so amazing because the children don't know how to sing, but then they do thanks to Maria!"""
5,Timeless classic,I did not watch this movie myself but it was given as a gift and she did absolutely love it.
5,Much better than I remember!,Some of my earliest tv memories include the once per year showing of The Sound of Music around Christmas time. I might have been too young to really get into it but I remember it being so incredibly long and not all that interesting. Many years later I watched it again and fell in love with this movie.Depending on your point of view Julie Andrews is most popular for The Sound of Music or Mary Poppins. Both are wonderful movies and seem to get better with age.In The Sound of Music Julie Andrews plays a Nanny sent to watch over a former military man's large household with his many kids. The house is run the only way the kid's father knows: militarily. With the power of her smile and singing she wins over not only the kids but their father as well. This story line has been done and redone since and before but The Sound of Music sticks out as a leader of the pack.There are very few movies I would say to purchase immediately but this is one of them.
4,Sound of Music,Was extremely happy to see this item on Amazon with a special price. Though I was not interested in Blue Ray but loved a DVD and I can't wait to show just two songs from this priceless movie (Do Re and These are the few of my favorite things) to my grand daughter when she visits from UK. The quality is very good.
5,This is one of my favorite things!,"I absolutly loved this video! The music, cast, and backdrop were perfect, and the script so realistic. I've always loved this video, but when I saw my friend preform in a play exactly like the video, it has encouraged me to sing more and develop my acting talents so maybe I'll be able to play Maria some day.""The hills are alive, with the sound of music. With songs they have sung for a thousand years, the hills fill my heart with the sound of music, my heart wants to sing every song it hears."""
3,Sound of Music,"This is a classic. A movie I've seen a few times over. To watch it in Blu-ray was icing on the cake. Amazon.com made the transition smooth in getting this movie from their place to mine. No complaints.....At all! Thanks again, Amazon!"
5,The Sound Of Julie Andrews,"I didn't care for Julie Andrews performance. Only joking!How can anybody fault it. her voice is the best i have ever heard any woman come out with, and the acting us oscar worthy. That year she lost out to Julie Christe in Darling, HOW! I have viewed both actresses performances and Julie trounced Julie Christies a mile of.THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SUPERCALIFRAGALISTICEXPIALIDOUCIOUS SOUND OF DAME JULIE ANDREWS"
5,Sound of music DVD,"My DVD arrived in 4 days, which was very fast. It was in good shape. What can you say about this classic movie? It will always be a favorite. I enjoy it so much and can watch it over and over."
5,The Sound of Music,"I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in the 1960's, My 3 1/2 yr.old granddaughter loves musicals and my daughter-in-law thought she would like this one. She was unable to find a copy so I went to Amazon and was able to order it and have it sent drectly to my granddaughter. She loves it and even sits through the whole movie."
5,The Sound of Music,"Shot in pristine color on location near Salzburg--and featuring that dizzying opening shot of Maria belting out the title tune from a verdant hilltop--""Music"" fully deserves its reputation as one of the most popular films of all time. The daisy-fresh Andrews is simply terrific, whether she's acting or singing, and the songs--""Do Re Mi,"" ""Climb Every Mountain,"" and ""My Favorite Things""--have become part of our cultural heritage. Adapted from the Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway play, the film might be a bit schmaltzy at moments, but in all, it remains utterly irresistible. The hills are still alive--and your singing pipes will be too--with the wondrous ""Sound of Music."""
5,Still great after 45 years.,"Go back to your childhoood. The sound and the picture are outstanding. If you are a fan, you MUST own this blu ray set."
5,One of the greats,"Everyone knows this film is one of the greats of cinema, and this BluRay presents it in the best transfer I have ever seen. Reminds me of the quality of restoration work done on the Bond films. Fantastic!"
5,Great Movie,"Have watched this movie every year on TV, decided it was time I owned it. My purchase went without any problems"
4,GOOD BLUE RAY.,"I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO WATCH ALL OF THE SOUND OF MUSIC YET, BUT WHAT I HAVE, I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED."
5,Sound of Music,It was excellent one of the best musicals ever made I highly recommend it to anyone who likes family type movies.
5,Beautiful,"I bought this as a gift for my partner, because he loves the movie (and so do I), and i think it happened to be one of the best purchases I've ever made. The set is beautifully put together, and the extras are really well made - which is good because sometimes we pay a lot of money for cheaply-built things. The music box is lovely (though it plays just a few second of favorite things, it could play a bit more) and Its being used to store some favorite things indeed.If you like this classic you will do well to buy this edition."
5,My Favorite Movie,"This movie has been my favorite since I first saw it - about 16 years ago, in kindergarten! I LOVE it!"
4,The hills will always be alive with the Sound of Music,"I love this film and it's one that is timeless and enjoyable each time I see it. Julie Andrews is one of my favorite actresses and she shines in this film. The cinematography in this film is absolutely breathtaking. The music is also memorable and brilliantly arranged. The dance sequences are excellent and the children often steal the show. The story is wonderful and although the film is long, it never seems dull and slow. I feel it's a must-own for any musical lover."
5,THE SOUND OF MUSIC ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF ALL TIME,The Movie is excellent. The only badpart is they cut out 2 songs from the BRoadway musical. They make up with it by the new songs Something good and I have confidense. When the new broadway play came out they had every song. The movie is in beautiful scenery and it is someting I have watched about 21 times.
5,sound of music,The reviews by:Dennis A. Amith (kndy); Richard Leafgreen (poiseidonboy)and Tate are all spot-on. this is a 5 star plus blu-ray movie. Still an exellent story - nostalgia from my secodary school years.Why can't all dvd's / blu-rays of this quality. Quality DTS sound should be STANDARDIZED to ALL dvd's / blu-rays. We won't mind paying a couple of bugs extra for quality. Those with the gear to utiluze DTS etc. could then still select the other sound options in the set-up menu.a must buy for all customers of all age groups.enjoy.andre
5,christmas gift,"i was surfing amzon for gifts for christmas for my kids and a friend. i decided on this dvd. i got it on time and im very happy. i would recommend amzon, thank ou so much."
5,The Hills are still alive with the sound of music!,"I purchased this as a family film to watch with my kids. My wife and I really enjoyed this movie growing up. Now my 8 yr old daughter is a fan. Certainly a time piece based on its setting, but it still delivers good wholesome fun. I highly recommend this version and 3-disc collection. Since I don't own a Blue-ray player it comes in handy in case I do purchase one someday. You can't go wrong with this."
1,Our world can do better without annoying sounds,"This movie was made in the sixties, we live in the 21st century, GET OVER IT!"
1,Confused,"This is very confusing. Is this a Blu-Ray offering, DVD, or both?It seems to be both because there's a slash / between the two formats, but much of the verbiage is about Blu-Ray. I don't give a fig about BR. It will be a distant memory in a few years. Can I play this on my generic DVD player?"
5,It be so def I can't hardly explain it.,"Now, y'all know them two be knockin' boots when dem kids be sleep. But they don't show nothing. Still, it were very fat.That chick all the time be singing. She no rapper, though. She sound like she be whining a lot. Come to think, maybe she ain't getting nothing."
3,classic musical,"This movie is okay, but don't ask any teens to watch it. I have to admit, it is a rather charming musical. Older people (I say that with the highest amount of respect)will probably enjoy along with young kids and Julie Andrews fans."
1,Sound of Music DVD,"After a long wait for the greatest movie of all time to appear on DVD, I was disappointed to see that the sound is out of sync with the picture. You'd think THX certification would mean something."
1,Warning to DVD-Rom viewers,"This DVD requires access to the internet if you are attempting to view the movie on a computer with a DVD-Rom drive. Presumably this is to download something from the internet to make the experience ""more enjoyable""?!? I have attempted to contact Fox about this problem and was told it isn't a problem to them. Consider yourselfwarned."
1,WARNING: If your player is not new it might not play this Blu-Ray version.,"One Star Release for a FIVE star movie. Not all Blu-Ray is the same. This disk will not play the movie in my Blu-Ray player. The menus work but the movie just locks up. I have to unplug the player to get it to reset. I bought this and have to watch the DVD version. I watch other Blu-Ray movies on the same player, but not this one. Looks like I have to stop buying Blu-Ray movies until the Blu-Ray specification stops changing then buy a new player. Very Disappointed!"
2,"Seven stars the movie, minus five stars the release","I was waiting for years the Blu-ray release. Of course I preordered this item.But what a disappointment! Sometimes picture is grainy, sometimes picture is out of focus, sometimes picture is not sharp. Ladies and Gentlemen this movie was made in the 60's not in the 20's. This movie deserves the better transfer possible in these days. The sound is pretty good, but I would like (and I hope I not alone) much much better instead DTS MA two channels stereo LPCM 192Khz/24bits to enjoy the full splendor of the music.I already have 2 DVD releases and this Blu-ray release. For whom may concern I won't buy more."
5,Classic Musical,"Great classic musical! this is something the whole family will enjoy! From grand children to grandparents, there is something for everyone. Very entertaining! Brings back alot of memories of being young."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was so excited at the prospect of this item, which includes a rubber ball that you put a solid ball of detergent into. It promises that the detergent ball will last 25+ loads. Um, no. Try maybe 5 before it is shrunken to the size it tells you is too small. It worked fine for those 5 loads in terms of getting the laundry clean, but that's a little pricy for me."
4,Good product,"This is a wonderful product. I live in an apartment, and dragging all of the wash supplies to the laundramat was a chore in and of itself. I throw in the ball and it cleans the clothes without any problem. You may not get 25 washes from one refill, but if you don't use hot water you will get close to that number. I am sold 100%."
5,Great Idea,I have been using these for over a year and they are amazing. They leave your clothes clean and fresh. I don't need to use fabric softener and the clothes (including towels) come out of the dryer soft. Great deal!!
1,Don't work!!!,"I tried the ball a couple times, did not clean at all, clothes came out smelling and looking dirty, Waste of my money!!! In the other hand it could be this cleaner is not intended for High Efficiency washers, Who knows, could not find any information in the package."
4,Clinton from his side,A contrast to the far right literature and nature of coverage of the Clinton administration. Essential to a complete understanding of the history of that period in time.
5,Measured and insightful response to the right wing wackos,"Sidney Blumenthal explores his Clinton years in a profoundly well written book that resolves many questions a caring reader has about that time.I chuckle when I read how a reviewer was ""a Clinton voter"" and then proceeds to take both Sidney and President Clinton apart. Only a school boy couldn't see through this childish ploy which is to justify the ill founded opinions of those writing the review.Take it from a life long Republican who was forced to leave his party due to the low lifes that now occupy it. This is a great book and the beginning of the more accurate look at just what the Clinton years were all about."
