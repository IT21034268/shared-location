2,Cute film ruined by awful camera work,"Keep the camera still please. Please, take your finger off the zoom button. The acting is good. The story is OK. But an enjoyable enough film is ruined by the jerky-cam. Dear directors. Dear cinematagraphers. Please buy a tripod or rent a steadicam. Stop it with the jerky-cam. It went out of style about a week after The Blair Witch Project went to the $1 theaters over ten years ago. Now, this ruins your film. It was unwatchable. It doesn't create uneasiness. It didn't add realism. It only made me unable to pay attention to what is happening. Every single shot of the entire film I felt the directors wanted to remind me ""you're watching an indie film"". Keep the camera still. Tape the zoom button down so you cannot accidentally press it. Stop it. Just please, stop."
2,Jeff Who Lives at Home [HD],I have nothing nice to say about this film that would help it in anyway I didn't like it but that is my opinion if someone eles does go for it but I say don't waste your money.
3,Interesting movie,"I would say it's a decent movie, but the storyline is a little weird. The cast is excellent and they do a decent job, but I think because of the way the script was written, it made the characters seem unreal."
3,Acting was good,"The story was not all that interesting in my opinion, but I liked the acting. Very interesting to see Susan Sarandon and Rae Dawn Chong in a movie like this."
3,It's OK,"Rented this via Roku, it's an OK movie. Not Segel's best effort, but a nice short movie to watch. Susan Sarandon is once again great."
3,Jeff Who Lives at Home,"Just ok. Not worth buying, thats for sure. I wasn't really entertained the entire movie. I actually got up a few times and did other things and then came back. It wasn't nearly as funny as I thought it would be. It's more of a thought provoking/inspirational, not comedy."
2,Jeff should just stay at home...,"If you're one of those people who still looks forward to new episodes of ""The Office"" after all these years, you'll probably like this film. If not, don't waste your time. I turned it off after 30 minutes. So this is what passes for a ""smart, well written comedy"" these days? Seriously? How sad. The plot and characters were stale, contrived, and over-the-top stupid. Like when Jeff's brother crashed his new Porshe into a big tree, while supposedly trying to impress or scare the pants off him. I couldn't take it anymore after that."
1,couldn't finish it,"Cast looked good so I thought i'd give it a try. Found myself wandering away and finally just stopped watching. Painful! So Jeff is a painful loser, his brother - a painful loser, the plot....was there one?...i was at least hoping for a bit of humor. nope. don't bother with this one."
3,WTF- not a comedy!,"This movie was pretty good, but I would NOT label it a comedy - certainly not an ""offbeat comedy"". It is a drama with some comedic elements. The main actors are solid and it was enjoyable, but rather depressing until the end. Not trying to spoil, but DOES have a ""happy ending""...."
3,If you liked What About Schmidt,This off beat comedy has some funny moments and Jaso Segal does a good job trying to carry it off.
4,Living at home can not always be a bad thing,This movie was much nicer then I thought it would be. I wouldn't call it a drama or a comedy but something in the middle. Hard to explain but was a very wonderful movie to watch.
3,just OK,GOOD RENT FOR FREE GLAD i DINT PAY. ITS JUST OK AM GETTING A B IT SICK OF JASON sEGEL BEING EVERYWHERE OPLAYING THE SAME CHARACTER.
3,Fairly funny and different from what I expected.,I thought it was going to be a straight comedy about how big of a loser Jason Segel's character was but instead it was more of an adventure that two brothers have. It was not a waste of time but not really memorable either. If you like these guys you'll probably think the same as me after watching it.
3,A little slow....,Well acted and had a good story line but got a little slow in places. The ending had a great message but was not realistic.
3,Decent,"It had some good actors, but it lacked anything that was too exciting. Decent watch, but not worth watching again."
3,Trailer comes off as a comedy but it's pretty much all over the place,"Title of the review says it all, the movie is just okay. The thing with the mother was kind of wtf, not sure why that was necessary. I could have passed on this movie and been just fine with it."
1,Terrible,Didn't even finish the movie. Waste of money considering all the other movies we could have watched instead. Jason segel is usually so good too
1,SUCKED,"ABSOLUTELY UNWATCHABLE CRAP WAITED TWENTY MINUTES FOR IT TO STOP BEING MIND NUMBING, PAINFUL, HORRIBLE DRIVEL BUT IT JUST WOULD NOT END. A COLONOSCOPY IS EASIER TO ENDURE THAN THIS"
3,jeff who lives at home,"It is a good movie, not great. Glad I rented it. Still a big jason segel fan. Strong acting but an ok script."
1,Piece of junk.,Followed the instructions to the letter and it still leaks. Buyer beware. Buy it at your own risk. I've had many different types of filters over the years and this is one of the worst I've ever had.
5,28 World Famous Waltzes,"Beautiful music which possible listen once again and once again. Seaborne ills and violences in the world at present, given disk fills our shower by thoughts about good, beautiful. Not so simply find seaborne ìóèíó, but I have found it in world Internet on Amazon.com."
4,keeps on ticking,"really impressed with this product! I bought it on sale from toys r us for $5 over 7 years ago. I expected a few months of usage, but I've used it about every day for 7 years and it just finally died. It took several falls from 6 ft, lived in the wet shower, and even out lasted a couple corroded battery sets. really efficient on power usage too (>500hrs on 3xAA's?). sounds like a cheap radio, but gets heaps of stations and volume is plenty adequate. I have much respect for Craig radios now, and am looking to get another one now. good work on this one guys!"
3,too much crowd noice,"A great selection of songs, and the band sounds great. One problem. Too much crowd noise. It got so annoying I could not finish listening to the CD. Too bad. Some crowd noise on a live CD is quite appropriate. This was too much, too loud. It interfered with the music."
5,Unexpected delight,"Not sure what I was expecting, but this is a very refreshing collection. Hypnotic and robust at the same time. Two thumbs up -- 'at's all I got."
5,Incredible,"I picked this up because I am interested in the Black Madonnas of Southern Europe and Medieval history in general. I also like ""early music."" This CD was an incredible surprise. The quality of the singing and musicianship is amazing. The Islamic influences in early European music are really brought out here. I can't recommend this more highly although it is probably not for the casual listener. But if you are curious, you can't beat the price!"
5,Love it!,We used to live in a neighborhood that had a large Jewish population so the local grocery stores carried many kosher items. My husband and I always love trying different foods from other cultures so we grabbed a bag of these one day to share. Since then we were addicted to these. They have a great crunch to them and come in a variety of great flavors. Since moving we have not found these in any stores nearby. I am glad them come in individual bags or these would never last in our house.
2,Best for cake,It runs out of power for any serious cutting in the kitchen. I was looking for a cordless replacement for the kitchen electric knife. This thing is quite bulky and suited more for slicing birthday cake than meat.
4,.hack infection (Part 1) Official Strategy Guide Review,"Being new to the .Hack series, I have found the guide extremly helpful in pointing out few tips and pointers to help you with the game.Anyone wanting to know Monster Stats, Item, Weapon and Trading Lists will not be disappointed, plus the excellent Grunty raising guide which provides you with High Level Weapons and Items very early on in the game!.Overall a very satisfying guide!Thank you, Doug Walsh."
4,A Huge Tome But Full of Good Information,I bought this as a general Irish genealogy resource book for my library. It is chock full of information re where I can find what in terms of Irish genealogy research. It will serve as a wonderful resource.
4,Excellent Show!,"This is a fantastic show! I got hooked on it last year and rented the previous seasons. I bought season 4 and will have to purchase the rest too. I agree, the music is a little annoying...I too want to hear what they do. The other thing I didn't like is the case the DVD's come in. They are kind of hard to pop out being stacked together. It's not a normal DVD case. Love the show though. Can't wait to see more. :0"
5,investigators at their best,"I love this series and have bought every DVD offered so far. The TAPS team is very proffessional. They do not tell someone a place is haunted just because that's what the person wants to hear. They always have to have evidence to back it up. While not every case is a edge of your seater, the TAPS team does come across some pretty amazing things. If you're interested in the paranormal and want to see investigations done right, then you need this series."
1,Never will do business with again.,First off I just want to say I will never buy from this seller again. I purchased this item and waited a month for it to come and it never came. The e-mail communication was horrible took the seller 4 days to answer a simple question. Then I had to contact Amazon to get a refund. Do not buy from this seller!
1,Problem downloading video - resolved,"** Update: it took from Friday afternoon until Tuesday night to resolve the problem, but it has been resolved. If you cannot start the download, ask if they have resolved the issue with the ""incorrect character in the title of the show"" and it should put them on the right track. The episode is fun - if you enjoy the series, you will enjoy this one. **I bought this several days ago and cannot download it. I have called customer service thinking something was wrong with my PC. I was told there was a problem with this specific episode, but it would be fixed shortly. I am past the deadline they gave me for fixing the problem, but the video still will not download. The episode itself may be wonderful, I love this series, but be warned that you may not be able to watch it."
1,This show has gotten really boring,"All the team members remind me of dry toast, boring with no personalities at all. They all seem to be going through the motions these days. I won't waste my money on any more of these sets."
1,Fake wanna be Ghost Hunters/Plumbers,This guys are totally fake. I can't believe people believe these two guys. So fake. There are way more professional ghost hunters out there.
5,Compact size - great content,"I have the two other editions of the Blue Note album covers (the ones that are the size of an album) and I love to look at them. The only problem is that they are a little too big to sit and flip through. The size of this book- ""Blue Note: Album Cover Art"" is perfect for flipping through. It looks small but packs a wonderful punch. I couldn't believe how many album covers were in this book. This book fits nicely on a coffee table or end table. If you are like me, you'll find yourself looking at it daily - in amazement of the style and class that embodies the Blue Note image."
3,what's beef? beef is when your mom aint safe in the streets,"Go cop this joint. It's hot. But I feel sorry for Pridigy cuz his career's gonna end when jigga comes out with his new joint BLUEPRINT, what was prodigy thinkin' goin around dissin Jay-Z (WHAT ARE YOU THINKIN DAWG ?)Maybe he should sit down and have a talk with Canibus and ask how his sales are after LL Cool J messed him up real good. Prodigy, Jadakiss , Jayo Felony,Charli Baltimore, ya'll betta stop dissin Jay-z cuz you are gonna regret it. TRUST ME"
2,Dissapointing,"I was dissapointed with this album. There's only about 4 or 5 songs that I liked, Keep It Thoro and HNIC were the highlights. Many of the tracks were not Mobb Deep's style at all. Songs like YBE sound like bad 80's tracks. Being a fan of Mobb Deep, I was expecting a much better album then this. This CD won't be getting many spins in my cd player."
5,strait classic,this album right here is one of the best that you will ever here again so if you aint' heard it then you sleepin' on this kid the intro is bangin' wit bars&hooks the 'Genesis'to me is the tightest song on whole album but this is one of those albums you can let play all the way through sick lyrics and the beats is bangin' most of the productions are from havoc who is the hottest producers out there but yo if you aint' got this you aint' got nothin.HOLLA!!!
5,Classic. Nothing more nothing less.,"Album is Classic, vivid rhymes and priceless flows. Lyrically prodigy is one of the originaters. 6 out of 5 stars lol"
5,Prodigy is always coming raw.....,"I love this album, he brings it solo on this joint, some of the songs could have used more Havoc or Alchemist, but I won't complain since P kept it thoro throughout, go cop this joint now! this album will hold me over, peace."
5,Can I Give This CD 10 Stars??,This Cd by far is the best Hip-Hop album of the year!! The beats mixed with P's lyrics are an awesome combination. In my opinion this Cd is an instant classic!!
4,P. did his job,"Prodigy did his work on his 1st solo effort ""H.N.I.C"". Heads were demanding an entirely solo album by P. and he didn't disapoint. The album is dope, altough there r a few misteps like ""Y.B.E"" with that wack B.G...Prodigy isn't the HNIC right now but he's outta there putting decent works for all of mobb fans."
5,H.N.I.C- I'm feelin' it,"P's much anticipated solo joint is a scorcher. I always thought he'd shine solo one day and he did. But Mobb Deep fans beware- most of this does not sound like the Mobb's dark beats. Havoc appears on two songs here and he produced only those two, so the rest of the album has a different sound to their earlier releases. P pulls it off well and his voice projects well through every track. P chose to pull in half of Q.B in guest appearences on this one, along with regulars Noyd, Chinky and of course Havoc and they dont dissapoint. My best were 'What U Rep' 'Keep It Thoro' 'Rock Dat Sh**' 'Wanna Be Thugs' 'H.N.I.C' 'Do It' and Gun Play'. Mobb fans get this, its hot and probably the best rap album of the year. Peace."
2,O.K.,THIS C.D. IS JUST THAT O.K. I GUESS HE HAS TO MAKE A SOLO C.D. TO PAY FOR HIS INSULIN SHOTS. I THINK THAT HE SHOULD HAVE JUST STAYED AS A GROUP THING BECAUSE HE IS NOT REALLY THAT STRONG OF MC TO LAY DOWN HIS OWN C.D. OVERALL HE DIDN'T MAKE IT IN MAKE WACK LIST BUT HE WAS KINDA CLOSE.
3,~Prodigy~ Of Mobb Deep (H.N.I.C.),"This cd is off the chain. It have major beats and the lyrics are so real. My fav. songs are 4,6,9,12,13,18,and 21. Number 21 and 13 is the deepest song on the album. Now 18 that's my top fav. because B.G., threw that off the roof I mean he just shut it down. But the whole cd is tight the deaf. All I can say is gone head and grip that cd. IT'S WORTH THE MONEY TRUST ME!"
3,"Good, but Havoc is missed.","Prodigy steps up to bat and damn near knocks one out of the park, but comes up short and hits the fence. P rips the mic up with some great lyrics on HNIC, but its just not the same as his past work with partner Havoc. You'll liek it, but you wont love it."
1,CRAP!,"This was the worst piece for furn. I have ever purchused, Buyer beware, none of the bolt holes match up, table top is partical board and the 50's style retro ring was bent, had very sharp edges and the screws furnished to hold the ring on were to long and drove though the top of the eating surface! I'm debating on whether or not to even put the stools together...."
2,Eh.,"There are other, better books on the small garden out there. This book is filled with obvious statements e.g. ""choose plants and containers that suit the style of your window space."" Duh. The words and the design solution aren't the reason I bought the book. I bought it because first of all, there are a lot of pretty pictures. It's nice to page through if I'm bored or need a break. It's something to page through in 5 minutes. The second reason I bought the book is that I was really impressed with John Brookes years ago, before I had any training in design. I loved his gardens. So I wanted this book to see what he was up to. Nostalgia, really. Take it for what it's worth as part of a library. Other books to check out: David Stevens' Small Space Gardens, Joan Clifton's Courtyard & Terrace Gardens, James Grayson Trulove's Pocket Gardens, Katsuhiko Mizuno's Landscapes for Small Spaces: Japanese Courtyard Gardens, and Jamie Durie's The Outdoor Room, to name just a few."
4,Inspirational,Don't go buy this book if you are looking for instructions on how to do what. It's a wonderful book as inspiration. There are many photos of wonderful gardens that will make you get ideas for your own. That is really all I have to say about the book.
3,DOGGIES DON'T LIKE THEM,"I don't know why but my dogs are not interested in these treats. They love chewing on other brands of bully sticks but not this one. I guess they all have their favorites like people do. They don't compare to bully sticks which are meatier and tastier looking. But who knows, your dog(s) may like them?"
4,Well written history of the NBA,"The 90-minutes-video shows some of the nicest footage of NBA classic plays from the last 50 years. Denzel Washington leading through the show, makes a nice job of introducing players and styles. The Video shows the must-sees of every great player in the history of the game, only in the case of Michael Jordan the editors found some not so often seen footage which makes a nice surprise. All in all the video is well worth the money, one star deducted just for the fact that it concentrates on offensive highlight almost exclusively."
2,No captions or extra features.,Close-captioning doesn't work and there are no extra features to speak of. You would be better off just buying the VHS for less. The documentary itself is very good.
5,Every Kid Needs This.....,"Working in radio for 10 years, I never experience the joy of music until this cd came along!!! As a Christian mother, I always check my child's music before I allow him or her to listen it. This is a great way to get the old classic's redone in a NEW and FRESH ""hip"" kind of way! Way to go to the makers of this album! YOU TRULY ROCK!"
4,Best Value for Global Figures,"This is the best value for having global figures handy, and is one tenth the cost of the other great reference work, the Fitzroy Dearborn Book of World Rankings. Perhaps even more to the point, this book has something the other one does not: country by country data (although one could always go to the CIA World Factbook online for similar data as well as biographic listings). Having said that, it does not have the full range of detail that is offered by the other, such as domestic water shortages and energy consumption. This book has Internet and music charts--but none of the charts are comprehensive, generally listing top and bottom countries, not all countries. Bottom line: this is the best value for a portable book about global figures relevant to political economy."
2,Not enough help for beginners,"While the rhythm variations are plentiful in this book, there is scarcely little helpful instruction describing technique. For a book that purports to introduce bongo playing, one would expect more than three pages of striking instruction and technique description. Photographs of individual techniques are limited to one page of vague, grainy, black and white photos. No illustrations or step-by-step technique descriptions are provided. The CD is nice, but without better description of the individual techniques, it proves but a frame for guesswork."
3,Not so good if you don't know the basics already,"I thought it was a book for beginners starting from scratch. Unfortunately, I got it, and to my surprise, it didn't say much about the very basics of bongo playing in a way that was understandable. It jumped right into the music. It would help to know how to read notes and probably some basic hand positioning before getting this one. However, looking through it, I think it's probably better for someone with intermediate knowledge of playing"
5,the Best bongo book!,"Really a great book with a lot of martillo variations and many different fills. The audio CD makes it easy to figure out how it must sound, and there is an interesting section on non-traditionnal rhythms. I recommend it even for advanced players!"
3,Application is necessary here,"This is a good primer for Bongo's, understand that this is a afro-latin, Hispanic instrument and the applied rules are steeped deeply in those roots. And, this instruction delves the musician in exactly those techniques at the root level. It will require study and lots of time to incorporate the presented material into ones muscial psyche. The CD has become a staple of instruction material as of late, and that is the GOOD news. A great teaching aid and one (perhaps the only one for Bongo) which should not be ignored. The tools are here. Like all musical studies just add diligence and practice time and you won't be disappointed."
3,Poor Packaging,"This item was a decently price but it was poorly packaged, when I recieved it one end where the light attaches was bent in due to the bulk outlet plug sliding around in the box, but we were able to straighten it out and get the product to work prperly."
5,MAMBO,This is a great CD. Mambo es uno de los mejores grupos de merengue bomba. The best songs are Ella Tiene and Mambo Kandela. Ella tiene was written by Elvis Crespo! Tun Tun tambien trabajo como corista en este CD.
2,Warning nudity in these cards,"I own over a dozen oracle card decks. The picture on the box is beautiful which is the card of abundance inside. The cards should come with a warning that many of the angel cards are all nude.The fact that it says Angels, Gods & Goddesses I expected them clothed regally. I would not have bought them if I had known that. I would not buy any more decks from this author.I have card decks from Doreen Virtue and Diana Cooper that are beautiful.Not sure that I want to use them, would rather resell them to someone else."
5,Worth the read,"If you love Mr. Rogers, this book is worth your read. Through his letters he reminds us once again how to be a good ""friend"" and respect the feelings of all the people in our neighborhood."
5,For Grad Students of Finance who want every advantage!,"This is the supplemental Student CD-ROM for use with Principles of Corporate Finance 7th Ed. Brealey/Myers. Very helpful material. Can be used with Powerweb: Corporate Finance, ISBN=0-07-245816-X and Standard & Poor's website, ISBN=0-07-246745-2. Hope this helps one lucky student!SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (written on CD):PC - pentium based processor, windows 98/2000, Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 as default browser."
1,How bad can it get?,"I gave this movie about 20 minutes and I'm sorry I did.The Blu-Ray disc didn't have anything on it except ""play movie,"" not even a menu for extras or set-up.When I saw the makeup on the guy who was supposed to have been beaten within an inch of his life, I laughed. His face was covered in rough and he looked like a drag queen.This movie is a complete waste of anyone's time."
4,Awesome Independent Film,"More independents should turn out like this western. If you watch it to be critical, you'll lose out. The story line ran smooth, The clothing, firearms and gun leather was authentic. The Mark Redfield, Mike Hagan and Jennifer Rouse will be seen again, I'm sure. The extras did a great job. Hard to believe this was shot in Maryland. It really looked like Missouri. I hope Wayne Shipley is planning another ."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"This movie is horrible. The acting is laughable, literally. And the writing doesn't give the actors much of an opportunity, so they never had a chance."
1,I love westerns,"I have to have my occasional fix of the western genre. I love a good one, the last being 3:10 to Yuma. This movie however is just bad. The acting is terrible, the daughter is like a valley girl, the sheriff is awful, the indian girl? The costumes are weird and the music dosent make any sense. There are so many technical things, cameras in the background, wristwatch lines it is laughable. I am sorry-do not buy this movie."
4,Fine for crafts - not as thick as the real thing,"As I was using this tape for Christmas crafts, I didn't need quite the indestructibility of the standard silver version of duct tape. I was surprised at the variation between colors and thicknesses. From the same brand (Duck) I had several colors with three different thicknesses and different amounts of mesh or fibers in the tape. My craft project was so simple that it made no difference - I was going for team color combos - but had I been doing a more complicated or exacting project, I would have been concerned by these thickness variations.Anyway, by buying multiple rolls, I got free shipping and ended up paying about $2.50 less per roll than in my local discount retailer. I was happy with the product and deal overall."
4,Great color for marking purposes,"While the many uses of duck tape are well known, brightly colored versions are excellent for identifying electrical cables within the home entertainment center rats' nest. In fact, Duck Brand tape has been better for this purpose than multi-colored electrical tape. It actually seems to be more rugged in situations where the tape is being repeatedly grabbed.An example of a simple system using such color coding like in the automotive or aerospace industry is as follows:color category1 pink should never be unplugged: video2 red critical communications3 yellow video4 green cooking/blending/toasting5 white light6 blue cooling/heating7 silver battery powered but critical (laptop)8 orange tools9 purple printing/peripherals"
2,Lousy,"I purchased this thinking I was getting duct tape but to me it's more like electrical tape. I tried to get it to wrap around a pair of rubber sandals that were tearing apart at the strap that goes across the top of your feet. It was hard to get it to stick, hard to get it off the roll and keep straight, hard to cut. I want regular good old fashioned gray duct tape, ""...the hard stuff, 100 proof, takes your roots out."""
2,mediocre,"Well, my first impression is--somebody might like this cd--but it ain't me. Just average riffs, beats, with a lot of wordy songs that arn't memorable. I guess if you got this for free it would be an alright listen, otherwise only get this if it is cheap and you really like trashy sounding metal."
5,Sure to be a Bestseller!,"From the moment I opened the book and read the first paragraph I knew that this book was going to be the best thing I have ever read! Darby's ability to write in such a descriptive way so that you can picture the way that Toni looked as a child, the way her father looked as a young man in Harlem...The pain she felt at the hands of her mother and her male friends...I ran a mix of emotions from crying to laughter to total elation when she at last found true love. I didn't put it down until I was finished reading it. This is truly the best book out there right now. Absolutely!"
3,Rather disappointing,"Sad to say, I expected a lot more from this much-renowned book. Yes, Verne's lenghty and detailed descriptions of marine life are amazing, and one can truly appreciate his brilliant imagination in having conjured up all those underwater scenes. However, it gets really redundant and dull after the first 30 pages of above said descriptions, and the plot just fails to really take off. I was torn between times when I was deeply curious as to why Captain Nemo was the way he was, and at other times, I just really didn't care. I still think this work is good considering it was written over a hundred years ago; however, for a better read and appreciation of Verne's work, check out his Journey to the Centre of the Earth."
5,just as advertised,"The item I received was in perfect condition, and just as it had been described. It certainly was a good buy."
5,A Student's Grammar of the English Language,I find this book is very helpful for learning English as a Second Language people.
3,Ho-hum...,"Although there are some standouts (Torture [1629], Banshee, Fear), this album is boring. It's a good listen every-now-and-then, but it just does not do much for me. The music is not as well writ as the classics `Don't Break the Oath` and `Melissa.`If you are a die hard, I recommend this. If not, you won't be missing much if you just pass this by (and go, RIGHT NOW, buy Melissa or Don't Break the Oath!)"
5,THIS CD IS INCREDIBLE,excellent mercyful fate material the title track dead again is so awesome mind blowing then banshee and mandrake also excellent songs this album is not one that one can easily say no to for meer measly bucks its well worth the money and one thats needed in the die hard metal or mercyful fate/king diamond fan..this is excellent material i give it 10 stars not five..its that good..
2,The worst from the best,"King Diamond and Mercyful Fate are my favorite bands. However, i just got done listening to 'Dead Again' again. And once again I'm disappointed with it. I've had it since it's release year and it still hasn't grown on me.The best part of the album is the cover. The worst part is the title track that just keeps going and going(even King admits this in the song).The good news is, EVERYTHING else he has done is GREAT!!"
1,REALLY DEAD !,"THis was a deception after they return with ""IN THE SHADOWS"". The band completely lost its way, the guitars are weak and without inspiration, the CD is strange."
5,Top Ten,This is in my top ten of all children's books! It's a gem. The kids love it and it has a wonderful message!
5,Wonderful lesson,This book was used as a counseling lesson for elementary school age children. The story wove feelings of anger and jealousy with a surprising end. I also liked that a dad was the one who made the pie and helped his son turn his anger into surprised friendship. I am also planning on using this story as a children's story in church.
5,Enemy Pie,"Enemy Pie is a delightfully written book on a not often covered subject. The build up in thle plot is so well done, developing the story at just the right pace. The little boy's feelings are easy to identify with.I really enjoyed the way this book is illustrated, capturing the mood of the story.I will be donating a copy of ""Enemy Pie"" to my grandchildren's school library.Thank you Derek Munson and Tara Calahan King for such a great contribution to childrens literature."
5,ENEMY PIE,"Enemy Pie was sensational, the best children's book I have read in years. It is well written and has a great moral. Everyone should own this book."
5,Enemy Pie,Enemy Pie is a book about how to make enemies your friend.One summer a kid named Jeremy Ross moved into the neighborhood. One personal kid had Jeremy on his first and only enemy list. The reasons were that when the kid struck out in baseball Jeremy would laugh at him. When Jeremy had a party on his trampoline the kid was not invited but his best friend was. One day the kids dad heard about Jermy Ross. So he brought out an old recipe called ENEMY PIE. The adventure goes on with the kid and Jeremy and then something good happens.I really do recommend this book because it has great illustrations and it also tells you what to do with your enemies. This book is a picture fiction book.
5,a MUST-have!!!,"What's the best way to get rid of an enemy? Make him your friend! I've read this to all ages. Even the older ones don't see it coming! Genius way to handle bullies, in fictional stories AND in life! =)"
3,"A Review About ""Enemy Pie""","A Review About ""Enemy Pie""It wasn't the best book I've read, but it was a good book.The only things I didn't really approve of this book is because they didn't tell you the boys name who had an enemy.(The boy who had dark brown hair.) And the other thing I disliked about this book is the drawlings. It wasn't the worst drawlings I've seen, but it wasn't the best. Now, the things I did approve about this book,is that I liked what the lesson was. Also, the idea of the pie. I liked how they became close to best friends at the end of the book. The dude that didn't have a name didn't want Jeremy want to eat the enemy pie, because he thought there was something in the pie that was bad. So that was a sign that he liked Jeremy now. I think this book would help a kid who has an enemy at school."
3,"A Review of ""Enemy Pie""","Book Review for ""Enemy Pie""dislikes:.They didn't tell the boys name.(The one that had dark brown hair).Their drawlings weren't the best I've seenlikes:.I liked what the lesson was.Also, the idea of the pie.Their friendship at the end.The dude that didn't have a name didn't want his enemy eat the pie, because he thought there was something in that pie was bad.(He didn't want his enemy to eat the pie because he had to be nice to him all day and it eneded up to be fun)"
4,Neuropsychological Assessment,This book is an excellent comprehensive source of neuropsychological information that is not only good for graduate students learning about neuropsychology but is also a valuable resource for practitioners and instructors.
5,Neuropsychological Assessment by Muriel Deutsch Lezak,I have two other editions. I'm a psychologist and use this and the other editions frequently. It is a very valuable asset.
1,It says pack of 2 but only 1 was shipped... beware!!,I have contacted them about this - slow to respond - if I get proper response I will update this accordingly. Otherwise BEWARE of this FALSE product!
1,pathetic scam,"never one to write reviews, I felt it only right to save others their money. not only a waset of money but completely useless and all of two pages with one theme thats bogus. the first page sets the ""tip"" the rest is copies of irs winning forms, which ""prove"" nothing other than a win , I have gotten more of those in a day then the author in a year. means nothing. proves nothing. save your money...."
2,Boring!,"Beautiful writing style, but found I was so bored/tired of hearing about this failed relationship between father and son, I couldn't bear it any longer....flipped to the last few pages in the book just to see how it ended. Think the author's talents were wasted writing this particular book, but perhaps it was healing for him to do so."
4,the bill from my father,"i would recommend it! excellent insight and sharing into the life of a lonely man who is a hoarder with the onsetting of dementia, and how his son tries to deal with it."
2,The story of a total a--hole,"While Cooper is a perceptive and fluent writer, I HATED this book. The father was narcissistic, selfish, completely oblivious to the feelings or needs of others. I found nothing humorous in his quips. The man was a monster (OK I suppose that is too strong a word, but the ones that occur to mind are unprintable), and Cooper's retelling left me flabbergasted that the dutiful son was still concerned about the opinion of someone who wrote off everyone else and should have been written off himself instead of written about."
3,"Good, Not Great","Although it's beautifully written , I didn't enjoy this ode to his father near as much as 'Truth Serum'. There are some lovely keen observations about life and parents in general, yet not enough that made me feel it was truly special."
1,only a little bit of this book is worth reading,I read the whole thing--but only little bits of the book were worth the time it to read it.
3,Vector Calculus,"The proofs presented by the authors are a bit difficult to understand, although they are very completed."
1,I recommend the study guide (to the fourth edition),"The study guide to the fourth edition contains summaries of what one should learn from each chapter. I found these helpful in clarifying what the textbook was trying to present, and wished I had started using the study guide earlier in the semester than I did. I do not see a study guide to the fifth edition, so I suppose that one may not exist, but the summaries in the study guide to the fourth edition are still quite usable in conjunction with the fifth edition because the fifth edition of Vector Calculus is quite similar to the fourth edition."
2,not as good as described.,"good condition?? the binding is whack, it feels flimsy and can break apart at any moment. all of the corners are damaged and torn. there are stains of some sort and pencil markings on the pages. whoever evaluated this book and marked it as 'good' needs to evaluate themselves first."
2,Description Didn't Fit Book,"The book I received had pages that weren't attached to the spine. This isn't a huge deal, but I would have liked to have known this before I bought the book."
1,Not a Good Text,"This book is not helpful at all as a first multivariable calculus text. If you have not seen the notation used or read the mathematical language used in previous texts, you will not understand much of the book without significant help. The problems are more theoretical than computational which the examples only help with so much. There are other much more useful texts out there that would be considerably more helpful than this book."
4,good textbook; easy to follow,"I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews. To me this is a very good textbook. As my first textbook in multi-variable calculus, it is exceedingly easy to understand. Basically I just need to read the highlighted texts and do some worked examples, and all concepts and techniques become as clear as crystal. I remember using Apostol's calculus as my one-variable calculus textbook. That book is also by a Caltech author, but much harder to follow than this one. Actually I don't quite believe that this book was by a Caltech author. The book reads like a historical review of the development of calculus. I am pretty confident that even community college students can understand the texts effortlessly.In addition, I recommend Serge Lang's ""Calculus of Several Variable"" as a complementary text. I personally find learning multi-variable calculus most effortless when reading both books."
1,horrible horrible horrible,"This book is horrible. The example problems don't match with the practice problems, and the way they were written was simply hard to understand.It might be a good book for those who have plenty of experience in vector calc, but not for people, such as myself, who are relatively new to this field."
1,Worse math book!,"This book doesn't have any good examples at all. The problems in the sections are so different compared to the examples. Even my upper division professor said this book is trash, and they burned this book at the end of the school year. We have to use this book because the author of this book is the chairman of mathematics in our school. How sad! I heard a new edition is going to come out soon, so I hope it will be better for the future students that are taking this class. This book is just so bad!"
5,Tuscany Fireplace Fire Screen,"This is a beautiful fire screen, more than I expected ~ we get loads of compliments on it. It has added a rich focal point to our family room. There was an extra shipping charge on this item, which brought the price to twice (49 + 49) that of the item; which we feel was still a great price."
3,CD,Good for relaxation or meditation but is somewhat slow in tempo to play constantly. Great spa music when one needs to unwind!
5,Sacred River,Very relaxing. Just let your mind wander off. WhenI heard it on TV I knew I had to get it for me music collection. I listen to it at least once a day.
2,Not what I expected,"This doesn't have much of a world music influence, which I expected from the album title. It is better characterized as ""easy listening."""
1,not received cd Sacred River,I am not satisfied with the purchaseI have not received the productPlease contact the customer for a verification of the consignment
3,Sacred River has nice flow,"This CD is nice, easy to listen to. Not quite the level of Hillary Stagg but definitely worth purchasing."
1,"Scary Music, Scarily Misrepresented","""Scary Music"" is not scary at all. In fact, it labors under a false title--it should be described as vacuous pop music for equally vacuous films. With the exceptions of the Carlos music and one short piece and the (poorly formatted transfer to CD) theme music for ""Silence of the Lambs,"" this CD is awash in banality. Bad investment. Don't buy."
4,Tough Stuff,I purchased this book for my landlord who grew up in New York and he thoroughly enjoyed it. The book brought back many good memories. I received the book in a timely manner and in good condition.
2,"Popped out of the ""M.A.P."" system off my Urban Backpack","Attached it to the M.A.P. system of my large Sealline Urban Backpack where it's meant to be. Boarded the train to the Jersey Shore this weekend & put it on the luggage bin (not overhead). It popped off the backpack without me knowing. Thankfully a good Samaritan on the train noticed it & handed it to me. For something that expensive you would think it would stay put. It's not exactly a cheap product. Good thing I didn't have anything in it at the time. Had I have something important or of value & it got lost, I would be even more disappointed in the product. Now I'm hesitating to put anything on these outer attachments since I've lost confidence in it staying put to the backpack."
4,I'm glad I found this ring,"I needed to replace my lost wedding band and I found this ring. My original wedding band was this exact ring. The only difference was the one on Amazon was about half the cost of what local retailers wanted for a 10k version (Amazon 14k!) of the same style ring.I was a little bit hesitant after reading one or two of the other reviews, but now that I have this ring, I thought I had to contribute some positive reviews. I have no regrets as of yet for having purchased this ring. It has not faded or turned my finger green or any of that mess. Just a good ring for a great price. Thanks."
4,"Saw it first, then bought it","It isn't full of action, but it is a sweet story. Great Christian message. I bought it so I could share it with others."
2,Just not very good,"It's movies like this that give Christian movies a bad name. The story is not very interesting or well-written, the acting is wooden, and the direction is disjointed. I laughed and rolled my eyes a lot and didn't get much else out of the film. In all honesty, I did not even finish watching the whole thing. I quit around the half-way point. In searching a little more, I think I found out why this movie is so bad. Everything in this film was originally from a movie called ""Rescued"" put out by the Church of Latter Day Saints (aka Mormons). Someone apparently felt that the movie could be adapted for evangelicals by merely changing some dialogue and scenes. Some might think it's that easy to interchange LDS and Christianity, but it's not. Just avoid this film."
2,oh my...,"the script was a 3; the acting a 1; the island photography a 7...the message? Well, it was based on the faith we have in God and was very simple. Good for the beginning Christian, but there are plenty of other movies out there to give a much better Word without the poor, poor acting."
3,Island of Grace,The movie was okay in the acting category but I liked the story. It had the usual two guys competing over the same girl. One guy was just using her while the other truly wanted a long term relationship with her. In the end the right guy ends with her but not without alot of moments of rejection and disappointment.
2,ok but slow,Not a well writen story. Kind of slow. The end gets a little better. Would not watch it again. Actors eere good but the story was boring.
3,Fairly good movie,"I think the movie producers should've spent more resources on dialog and content and less on locations. The story is good but it lacked in quality writing. Though, I appreciate the effort very much."
1,Nah...,Has some good applications but overall boring and poor representation of true faith with annoying and unrealistic relationships between the characters. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
3,Ok movie,Pretty good movie I enjoyed it. Pretty good movie I enjoyed it. Pretty good movie I enjoyed it. q q
1,Not worth it,"This is perhaps the worst guide Prima has ever put out in my opinion. There are no maps and the level narrative is a joke and next to useless. It would have taken no more than a few hours to write the guides, and days to write the information about spells, armour etc, obviously to ""pad"" up the book. Get your help off the net and save your money."
4,Helping Understand Grandpa and Grandma,"This edition was purchased for a univeristy senior, studying SWEDISH and seeking a graduate program in his future in Gotenburg. The broad subjects within the handbook allow for a better understanding of his grandfather and great grandparents that emigrated from Sweden to USA."
5,Living Sacrifice: The Hammering Process,"I picked up this album the day it came out and I just want to say that it is the best Living Sacrifice album yet. The Hammering Process is definitely more melodic than their previous releases, but it still has that metalcore feel to it. It's impossible to listen to without moving to the beat. The guitars on this album are amazing and the new percussionist that the band signed on adds some unique sounds that really boost the quality of the album. It's been four years in the making and I must say it was well worth the wait. If you are a fan of hardcore or metal, this album is definitely worth your time and money."
5,mmmm Crunchy,"this is the second 2 last LS cd. There is a lot of stacato-ness in the songs (crunchy) which gives it a very percussive and pummeling sound (hence the name ""hammering process). Think of it as a transition from CIF and reborn. it has more chanting (non growled vocals than any of their other cds. this an very original cd from a very original band. i do not like this cd quite as much as CIF or reborn but it is extrememly good and worthwhile to buy"
3,"Pretty, but boring","THis is a short film that is a typical school movie from the 1960's in style. Basically, it just shows the pond and uses a few quotes from the book."
2,He could do better!,This is a very interesting book about the Japanese Ninja but it is also not a very good book. The photos are blurry at the best of times making instruction hard to follow. Also some of the topics covered are scantly reviewed. But the good point is that there is a lot of interesting reading here and for traditional ninjutsu fans it would be a good buy. Everybody else avoid it. This was one of the first books that I ever bought at a very tender age of 10. At the time I was going through Ninja madness. A martial artist of Charles Daniel's ability and knowledge can do better.
1,Damaged old edition of trauma textbook.,"I thought it is the seventh edition it turn out to be the sixth edition ,furthermore the book is damaged in many places,it took long time to be sent .overall it is not worth 43 dollars plus shipping.I am very diappointed with the purchase."
3,Medium,"Although it is a reference book for trauma surgeons and must be part of their collection, it is a boring book, with long tiring chapters an sometimes inconclusive."
3,"Great game, but a note of caution...","It is a great game. Everything is so real and challenging. However, I played this game for one day, and now there is nothing left to do. I'm not sure if it was worth the price for such a short playing time."
3,Just OK,"This game sounded so great for my daughter that loves animals, but she has not used it very much over the last 2 years. I have played it and it is a little discouraging as you must get each case right to progress. THis is OK if you have zillions of free minutes to play. I think I played it 3-4 times and then I lost interest. Graphics are a bit dated."
3,Mediocre,"I agree with the first reviewer--not a very useful text. More academic than anything else. I pretty much walked away with nothing from this book. Is choppy and just a compilation of various topics written by a variety of authors--it is like reading different research papers. None of the book is integrated. As the first reviewer said, a better book would have been a text written by one author with an integration of ideas."
5,"Open the door to better understanding the ""fakes!""","Dr. Rogers certainly knows his ""stuff!"" Take it from one of those guy's who has ""been there and done that."" His arrows hit the mark! Deception and malingering, these are not just mere words to echo in the wind. The author walks along side of the reader, while all the while supporting his professional perspectives with documented and keenly researched facts.Expertise is constantly evident, with solid exploration being given to 1). Where we've been; 2). Where we're at; 3). And, where we're going regarding better detecting the ""fakes"" and how to best utilize the available wealth of information contained within these pages.The true magnitude and complexity surrounding this element of psychopathology, etc., to the qualified and perceptive researcher, is crystal clear, indeed.This book ought to be readily available to all professionals claiming to be experts in this potentially deadly arena of forensics!"
5,Echoes of a Horror,"These are original recordings that those who fought in the war would hear, so expect scratchy and low grade audio quality, but they are the true pieces of music. You can feel the exhilaration, optimism and, eventually, weariness of the home front. You can feel the despair of the soldiers. It is an eery CD to hear because there are also original recordings directly from the battlefield and from reports of returning combatants.This is a musical (and eyewitness) documentary of World War I."
5,This has started a great tradition.,"My husband, a huge Packers fan, has made the tradition of watching this DVD every Thanksgiving weekend. It is a wonderful DVD, rich in history, that makes football enjoyable to even the the least of football fans."
5,FUN!,Bought this as a gift for the Packer fan in my life. She absolutely loved it! It arrived in great condition.
5,GB Packers-complete history dvd,Anyone interested in NFL football history would enjoy this dvd. A great documentary about the GB Packers and the famous Ice Bowl. Worth watching.
5,"Great game, epic battle,","Great game in terrible conditions, and watching this over and over confirms. JERRY KRAMER WAS OFFSIDES!!!!"
4,"Next best thing to the ""lost"" CBS broadcast","Not much can be added to the other online reviews listed here. Two things that amaze me to this day are: 1. CBS Sports either never bothered to videotape the entire game, or else they erased and lost the broadcast videotape. 2. The fact the NFL Films 16mm camera equipment did not completely freeze up from the cold during the game. Good thing their cameras functioned and recorded the action."
3,Works OK,This dimmer has an distinct on/off switch and the further you slide it in the up direction the brighter the lights become. Not a typical 3 way.
2,Good flyer Not very durable in the rain,I Got This Toy on a windy day so the next day i flyed it and it flys very Good but it started to rain which makes the plane very sentive then one day it split apart i you guys that have a young child like 4 or 6 they will like it but if you are a teen you wont like it then you better get a real RC Airplane Or heli
3,A GLARING omission but otherwise cool,"This is a nice collection but I don't understand how the Hell in the Cell match with Mankind can be left off of this set! To me it's like leaving out the Hogan v Andre match in a Hogan set or the Ricky Steamboat v Randy Savage match in their DVDs.Not to bemoan the subject but this is not just a classic WWF/E match but one of the all-time great matches. I've read posts that said because Taker wasn't acting as the ""Deadman"" that match doesn't fit. But I'm sure there are ways to creatively edit the motorcycle entrance, because once the match gets going I don't think anyone can tell the difference between the American Badass's wrestling style and that of the Deadman."
5,Great Collection,"I don't know how people are able to write a review for a DVD that hasn't come out yet. Sure they know the match listings, but they don't have a clue how the DVD is produced.With that said, I watched the DVD last night and it is awesome. Before each match, there is the promo leading up to said match (if that makes sense). There's alot of crazy stuff going on this DVD, great entertainment."
4,GREAT FOR TAKER FANS!!,"This is a good dvd for undertaker fans and if your looking fo hardcore you should watch mick foleys greatest hits and misses it is also a great dvd this contains alot of older superstars from the attitude ara, wich I think thats better than the newer superstars... The bottom line is I think it is worth it. One of the matches i reccomend is Undertaker vs Mankind Boiler Broom Brawl."
5,Great Item,"I purchased this for my boyfriend who really wanted it and he loves it, this dvd is great for any wrestling fan."
4,Interesting set,This is an interesting set but how many of these undertaker dvds are out there. I mean some of these matches are on other sets. But I'll prob get it for the boiler room brawl match and the more recent ones since I don't watch pay per view or wrestling on tv anymore.
4,"Good DVD, but could have been better","The Undertaker is one of my favorite wrestlers in the history of the WWE, so I could not wait to get my hands on this DVD. How ever there are some of his matches that I liked, and wanted on this DVD that are not on it.If you are looking for Undertaker Vs. Steve Austin from Sumerslam 98, or the first Hell in a cell match, or for that matter his Hell in a Cell match with Mankind from King of the ring 98, look elewhere.There are some matches I could have done without, but there are also a lot of good ones (some great) on this sett. Highlights of this set are both the Mankind matches, both the Hell in a cell matches and the Last Ride match with Mr. Kennedy. I am ranking this 4 stars because of how many matches are on it that I keep re-watching."
5,All-Clad Copper Core 3 Quart Casserole,"My son ask for another piece of All-Clad Copper Core for his kitchen. It arrived on time, packaged very well, and in perfect condition. The best is that my son was very happy with this product."
4,Yummy!,"I am a year-round pumpkin lover and these pumpkin spice cookies really fit the bill. It's hard for a gluten intolerant person to find much to say ""yummy"" about, but these cookies definitely are!"
5,You will love this one- horse person or not!,"This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. It really covers ground. It is educational, very well researched and written with such knowledge and passion that even the chapters that from the title seemed like ""the same old stuff"" , were interesting. I could not put it down!!I bought extra ones to give as holiday gifts for my friends and they too loved it, whether they were interested in horses or not.This book is an interesting and refreshing new point of view, that will help people to understand the prey/ predator relationship between horse and a human seeing it though the horses eyes. It is a journey through the history of the horse and a human as partners which offers hope for horses today, but more so makes the reader realise how much hope the horse today offers people all over the world.A book you can go back to and read over and over, each time getting more out of it."
1,invisible cactus plants,"the planters are miniscule, and none of the seeds sprouted in either of our planters... should be called a cactus graveyard..."
4,"Great DVD's, but lacking a bit.",I'll try to be quick.You get the first 10 years. They go through the entire year with a recap of the teams which I did like.They then show the Super Bowl highlights. I wish they did show the entire game but they don't. They just show certain key plays which is cool but just not enough for me. That's what you get. Don't expect the whole game. Expect what ESPN shows every year during Super Bowl time.
2,What a waste . . . again,"I will not give the NFL a single red cent until they crawl out of their hole and release the complete unedited broadcasts of the entire games. They are wasting a great opportunity. How great it would be to watch every play, with all those great players of the past, to actually relive those great games. Who wants another edited rehash with some overpaid talking head pontificating about things every football fan already knows. Please do not buy this garbage. Make them do the right thing!"
2,only highlights,"I heard that the NFL was releasing the past superbowls on dvd, I was excited to say the least. Then I found out these are only highlight films. A real dissappointment to say the least. The films are available in their entirety; why not release them? I was willing to pay well over one hundred dollars for each box of ten super bowls, as were several of the people that I was at a super bowl party with this year. Too bad the NFL fell short again."
2,Not the whole games. Just highlights....,"These contain highlights of the Superbowls, pretty much what NFL shows every year on cable. I'm disappointed because I'd like to see the actual game being played and not just highlights. If you don't mind then get it, its good but if your like me and excpected the full games then skip it or buy it used."
3,Whats the deal,Why cant they have a full GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. The NFL cant ever let us enjoy the game in its full. The dvd is good if you dont want to watch every single game for 3 hours but to me it would be alot better.
3,Super Bowl Collections,"On the positive side I liked that the video included color footage. I am very disappointed that the DVD's were not complete games. Why is it so hard to understand that some of us would like whole games!!!!!....not just highlights. My search goes on. I seek whole games of old superbowls, Michael Jordan games etc. If anyone knows of such products....please help me. Thanks in advance. achtioc@computerstodayinc.com"
4,Great discs but for Super Bowl III.....,"This set is a terrific dvd of the first 10 super bowls and the extra side feature of coaches & players. However, I gave it 4 stars because Warners Bros did not include the digitalized version the SB III I have the version in vhs (looks 10 times better in tape THAN dvd!!!). Maybe its due to re-issue rights. The replica super bowl ticket along is worth the price of the set."
5,Get the book!,"Get this book because it is a real guide. I checked it out at the library first to see if it was something that I really wanted. I would advise the same thing to you as well. I know for sure the Los Angeles County Library System has the book. I would assume all library systems in CA have at least 3 copies of the book circulating around. You are going to want to buy it so you can make lots of notes and to go back to use as reference, especially for the legal parts."
2,"A milestone, in a way, but...","The movie has a complicated plot, true, leading to some amusing moments. But there are also disturbing, gratuitous plot elements. First cousins discover that they know each other already - because they had had an affair years earlier. Most people would be horrified to discover that they had had relations with their own cousin, but not here. Other cousins - one a nymphomaniac, the other very repressed - predictably link up, even knowing that they are first cousins. In any case, it is decidedly NOT for the whole family, as another reviewer suggested.Its best moments come from the East German family's ""Kosher for Dummies""-level cramming to keep up Jewish appearances. Because of this the movie has some minor significance in being the first postwar film in which the directors and the German audience were comfortable with Jewish humor. But if the film were set in France or Chicago instead of Berlin, I doubt we'd be paying much attention to it."
3,Yawn!,"Not a bad film; has some real perspectives on life in general if you can stick with it. My wife is into foreign films so I ordered it for her for her birthday at her request and then she made me watch it with her. To me it was ""mildly interesting"" but I'm sure my wife thought it was great."
2,Handel's Alcina (with audience),"Musically and vocally this recording is good. What is rather disruptive are the stage sounds - thumps, bumps and knocks, probably due to the poor placement of the microphones where they pickup extra stage as well as audience noise. Technology when recording live performances has improved greatly, this however should not detract from the overall excellence of the singers and the musical direction of this recording."
2,"Why are you ruining Handel, Sutherland?","Sutherland muttering to herself in some indecipherable human tongue is not fun to listen to. Also, her huge voice ruins Handel's light orchestration. Also, Sutherland's coloratura technique is all wrong for Baroque coloratura. To hear true Baroque coloratura virtuosity, listen to Sills' renditions of ""Non disperar; chi sa"" and ""Da tempeste in legno infranto"" from ""Giulio Cesare"". Sills' embellishments are so difficult that, if Sutherland were to use them, she would collapse!"
4,A good book,"This is a good book. If you are interested in reading a book about reicarnation; the author did a good job in my opinion. Except for some amazing theories about how and why souls do reincarnate ( the author seems to have a Christian background; so, I found a few theories of his about reincarnation a bit outrageous... ) the experiences shared ( if true and not inflated ) are of the maximun interest. I really suggest people they should read this book as a ""light"" approach to this matter. So far, this is the best book I have read upon this subject."
5,Wonderful,I adore this book. It was so fascinating and so enlightening I was truly impressed. If you ever wondered if you had a past life or wondered why you do some of the things you do now ... maybe it's the secrets lie closer than you realize.
5,This book is logical!! It makes sense for the skeptics,"In a sentance: this book answers ALL questions that even the most intelligent questioner of such ""far out"" stuff like past-lives will have."
3,My personal review....,"This book wasn't bad - it started out great but lost steam towards the end. It was ok, but not what I'd hope for."
2,Not So Many Collected Works of Gustav Flaubert,"How do you put together the collected works of Flaubert and leave out his best novel, Sentimental Education? Who compiled this collection?"
2,Weak Production,"In my late middle age, I'm rediscovering the music of my early years and Janis Joplin is one of my favorites. Her soul searing style always gets to me.There were only 4 songs out of the 10 that I enjoyed: Try, Cry Baby, Ball and Chain and Move Over. Unfortunately, this is not the DVD I should have bought. There is no digital enhancement of the sound or film used in the production. I was expecting a higher quality production."
2,"SyQuest Sparq Drive: Delivers, temporarily.","Pros:Inexpensive, heavy storageCons:Poor design, poor companyOf course, the future of the Syquest company is hanging in the balance with the recent buyout from competition Iomega. However, shortly before this merger they released a 1 Gigabyte removable storage drive called the Sparq. On paper, the Sparq is an amazing bargain. Under $200 price tag for 1 Gig storage, and the cartridges, compared to Zip disks, are very inexpensive. However, the technology is flimsy, I personally have gone through 4 of the drives in about a year, and Syquests tech support (or lack thereof) is a major frustration. So in this day and age where you have many more removable media choices (such as CDR) Syquest Sparq is not worth the headaches.(Originally Written: Oct 01 '99)"
3,"A very extreme novel, for the most hard core of s&M'rs.","This book is definately for extreme readers only. The scenes are graphic and not for those with weak stomachs. I really liked the first 3rd of the book, but as the novel progressed, it lost a story line and just jumped from scene to scene. The acts became more and more vile with consumption of EVERY body excretion appearing as the only connection between the scenes. I was rather disgusted as i am not into brown and yellow sex, but those who are would like this book. The author is very descriptive, but her obvious nihilistic beliefs penetrate every orfice of this novel and the reader is left with only despair and a turned stomach. The submissive parts were rather good though, and the scenereos, though unbelieveable were exciting at times."
1,Just plain bad writing.,"I was not offended but, it was just so bad the story was hard to follow. It made hardly any sense it was just plain bad!"
3,"Cool idea, but nor much to do.","This is an excellent idea by Ubisoft, don't get me wrong, but it is horribly implemented. The songs that are included in this ""game"" are more like sheet music, and after you play them there is nothing left to do.Jam Sessions, isn't as much a game as it is a pocket guitar, and I would say that it is worth about half as much as retail (15$)."
4,Pretty Cool Game,This game was pretty cool. Its easy game more for leisure not for competitive play. It shipped fast and is a great addition to my games (:
4,Great for what it is,"Don't expect Guitar Hero out of this software. It is not a ""game"" It is a guitar software piece. The D-pad acts as a chord selector and your strum to play that chord. It is open ended and you can play any song you can think of that uses straight chords, sorry no picking individual strings. I would love to see someone take full advantage of the software by hooking their DS up to an amp and playing a little show with it."
3,JAM SESSIONS IS OKAYY...,I BOUGHT JAM SESSIONS LAST WEEK AND I WAS SO EXITED BECAUSE IVE BEEN WANTING TO PLAY GUITAR!!! SO I RUSHED TO TARGET AFTER READING AMAZON REVIEWS AND I WAS FUN FOR ABOUT A DAY. AFTER THAT IT REALLY DOESNT DO ANYTHING FOR YOU UNLESS YOU JUST WANT TO SING ALONG TO GUITAR CHORDS. YOU CAN GET COOL CHORDS ONLINE AND PLAY ALONG! BUT THATS ABOUT IT. SO ITS SO SO FOR ME..BUT NOT BAD ILL HAVE A GUITAR HANDY FROM NOW ON. OH YEA AND IF CONECTED TO A SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM IT SOUNDS REEEALLY GOOD!
2,Good idea gone wrong,This game had a great concept but its like you hit the same repetitive notes over and over it gets old really fast and the song selection is awful stick with guitar hero
5,Great product,My grandson was very happy with the game and it was a great price. Shipping didn't take long at all.
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I am really disappointed in this game. I saw it like a month ago before it came out and I couldn't wait to get it. I thought it was gonna be like a little guitar hero but this game is nowhere near the fun of guitar hero. it doesn't even play along with you when you play the songs. all you hear is when you strum on the guitar, so if you have no idea how the song goes you'll be sitting there just playing notes in order. you dont even have to be in time to complete the song. don't make the same mistake I did though. I bought it the week it came out and I sold it to gamestop about 2 weeks later and only got 12 dollars for it. DONT GET IT!!! unless you enjoy playing songs out of rythym and stuff."
1,Geosafari Geography,"I ordered geosafari geography and got geosafari science. I don't know what to do to get the correct cd. It is very frustrating to receive something you did not order. I have needed this cd for school for I am a school teacher. Now that it is a month later, I still do not have the cd I needed and the money I spent was wasted. If anyone can help me I would greatly appreciate it.Kathi Daniel"
2,Inexpensive and very light weight clog,"This clog was inexpensive compared to crocs, but I found it did not fit my foot very well. It is, however, very light weight and would otherwise be comfortable. It is also not very attractive. I would not wear this one anywhere but my own yard for gardening, etc."
3,A Little Snug,"Great price when compared to the outdoor catalogs, but I'm not as sure about the quality, since I haven't seen the higher priced items. The size I ordered was supposed to fit 8 to 9 (I wear 8.5) but my toes are pushed against the front, so ORDER UP!"
5,Great pan,"Love this pan. My mom gave it to me and I use it all the time and I get many compliments. Others have told me they have pans like this and can't get them out of the pan or the detail is not very good, they did not have this brand of pan either. The cakes turn out beautifully. I use Baker's Joy in my pans and there is never any sticking. I wash mine by hand and you do have to get down in all the indentations but it is worth it when you are getting all the compliments."
5,Simply grogeous,"This pan produces the prettiest bundt cake I've ever made. I love to make persimmon bundt cake and steamed persimmon pudding and the resulting dessert is almost too pretty to eat, especially if the Cathedral is dusted with ""snow"" (powdered sugar or white icing)! I love the fact that it is so heavy-weight. I have given several of these as gifts along with a bundt cake recipe book. Nice way to spend a cold winter day during this recession, making a beautiful bundt cake!"
5,Nordic Ware is the best there is,I have several Nordic Ware pans and I love them all. The cakes always come out clean and beautiful and the pans wash great in the dishwasher.
4,Grease it REALLY well,"This pan needs to be heavily greased in order for it to release cakes from its intricate details. I gave four stars as my last bundt would not release, even with a thorough greasing, and the cake center fell out, leaving the crust in the pan. This hasn't happened before, but I'm concerned that the crevices are gathering a residue that is beginning to stick to my cakes. Because of this, I used an old toothbrush to clean the pan meticulously. I'd rather not have to do that again.Otherwise, it is solid and sturdy. We do place a small sheet under the pan in the oven to keep it from tipping."
5,Very Pleased,"Im very pleased with Nordic ware. This cathedral bundt pan makes a beautiful cake. I made a lemon pound cake for a friend of mine for Christmas, she, her children and guests were in awe. I used Pam spay for baking on the interior surface. No problems. Take care of your Nordic Ware and it will serve you well."
5,deep research and important recovery work,"For anyone interested in the sadly neglected British author Sarah Grand, or the phenomenon she named -- the new woman -- this book is a must. The research is incredible and the writing is unusually clear and even moving for a work of criticism. I've only read one novel by Grand -- The Heavenly Twins -- but this book made me want to read more. I read a library copy of Magnum's book, but I wish it would come out in paperback so I can get my own, since as a teacher and reader I will want to consult it in the future."
5,bring back Sarah Grand,"There are a few discussions of the greatly neglected Sarah Grand in other books, but this is THE BOOK on this important WOMAN WRITER. I thought that this was a biography at first, but it's not. It really gets into the Victorian period, and I learned a lot. I have only read one Sarah Grand book, but I want to read them all now! Are they in print?"
4,Very good item,The knife block is everything it was advertised to be! I am proud to own this item. It is a high quality cutlery knife block and sharpner!
3,not great,"My son loves Nemo more then anything his room is nemo, his last 2 birthdays were nemo. So you can imagine how excited he was to recieve this game. We do not like it at all I find the graphics to be horrible and its def harder then alot of the other games. He will play it for a few minutes and then he goes right back to toy story"
1,"Bad Graphics, Bad Game",My 3 and 4 year olds will not play this game. The graphics are really bad and the learning adventure is more of a video game than an educational game. It is not very intuitive and my children are bright. Buy Blues Clues instead!!
4,good overview,"gives season by season tips on things that need to be done to keep your house in good condition. If you follow the prentitive maintenance suggested, you'll have fewer household emergencies down the line."
5,Awesome drawing book for all ages,"I have given this book to myself, to my friends, to the children of my friends on at least 4 or 5 different occasions, everyone loves it! a wonderful passing time activity for couples, adults, on rainy, snow storm days. The drawings inside are simple and creative, you don't have to be an expert to produce something great, they are good for children of all developmental stages. I plan on giving it next to a toddler with down syndrome. wonderful book illustrative of cute japanese designs. it is best colored with crayons or color pencils. pastels work if you do it gently..."
1,Seriously Inappropriate,"I have a major issue with this coloring book. When I was flipping through it during December (looking for presents for the little ones in my life), I was shocked to find a page with body parts and the directions to ""Draw a dead person""."
5,great activity book for the young and not so young ones,My daughter and I both can have hours of fun with this book!! I would really recommend to any creative kid and parent
1,"Great book, but watch out for inappropriate things.","This is a really cool book, and I've given it to three children in my family, all who have loved it. HOWEVER, this Christmas I gave it to my nephew who found a page in which the project is to ""Color the things you like."" The page shows various items, some of which are a whiskey bottle and shot glass, beer cans, and a syringe and spoon. If the publisher reads this, please consider removing those items as I'm sure it is mainly children who receive this book, even though the age range says ""up to 99"". (Note: This is really a 5-star book, but I rated it as 1-star with the hopes that the publisher is more likely to notice poor ratings.)"
5,"Like doodles, very creative & appealing","Like doodles, was a much appreciated birthday gift given by me; I now keep copies in stock!"
4,Nice drawing/coloring book,"I bought this for a little girl who just turned 4. She liked the book, but I think she is a little too young for it since she can't really draw yet, just colors. In any case, soon she'll get a bit older and will definitely enjoy it more."
5,Waiting for DVD with extras,"I also noticed Mary Martin at the curtain call at the end of the show (you can't actually see her face - I just deduced it from the white hair). Why was her performance removed and no credit was given? Whether it was her peak performance or not should not be an issue. Nevertheless, this video is a gem. It really is a historical glimpse at musical theater. The fact that theater only lives for the moment and is seldom preserved - is one of the most frustrating aspects of the theater. Luckily we have a few videos like this one to help us remember. WE NEED THIS VIDEO IN DVD FORMAT WITH EXTRAS - AND MARY MARTIN'S PERFORMANCE SHOULD BE INCLUDED - PLUS OUTTAKES AND BACKSTAGE BRAWLS - WE WANT IT ALL."
1,Not Worth Your Money!,"If you want to hear Ashanti's ""Foolish"" just turn on a radio; do not spend more than a cent on a song that is played 10,000 times a day. Ashanti's singing is bearable compared to the wonders (wonder as to how they nabbed a recording contract) on the radio today, but it is not outstanding. Her light, straightforward lyrics sound like her diary entries or poems teens scribble in notebooks while daydreaming about their crush. Her music is manufactured, radio-friendly R&B but she holds promise considering that she at least writes her songs.Everyone has been saying that she sampled Biggie's ""One More Chance"" but Biggie's song, which was produced by famous sampler Puffy, got its score from Debarge's ""Stay With Me"". ""Foolish"" sampled a sample! Enough said."
2,The Only Thing Foolish Was Not To Include Any Extras.,"The 10-week-straight #1 smash on the US Billboard charts is now going all around the world, I see, though the USA gets first dibs on all the singles. After tying with the Beatles for most top ten singles at one time, and debuting at #1 with her solo effort, we get this.It's Foolish. Not just the song, but the CD too.Radio edit and album version on one CD? I never could notice the difference, but it's filler material, and that's pretty much essential in today's modern R&B Discs.The great thing here is the instrumental version, which most of us would probably like, you and one million other wanna-be Ashanti's. She's the next big thing and there's no escaping it, but where's the bonus tracks we need from people like her? Maybe a remix? An unreleased track? Forget this, go get the album, which is also a 3-star CD.GRADE: C-BOTTOM LINE: All the things that we accept, be the things that we regret...that's a lyric. That's the truth."
1,Foolish? No Doubt!,"I was listening to this jam at some trendy hip hop club a few months back. It threw me off balance, because I thought it was Biggie Small's ""One More Chance."" I was like, ""when do we hear Biggie, and who's that girl singing?"" Turns out that it wasn't a Biggie song at all, but rather a single by Ashanti, who has come off the hype machine with a very sucessful album and single. Unfortunately, while Ashanti can sorta sing, ""Foolish"" is a bust because it practically borrows (steals?) the entire track ""One More Chance."" That's originality? I don't mind sampling, but c'mon! Give me an edge. And don't get me started about the lyrics. R&B has taken such a downward spiral these days. But I don't blame Ashanti; I blame the diabolical hype machine that keeps churning out garbage like this."
5,AwEsOmE,"Yeah, there are people thinking Ashanti isn't that good, well maybe if you were a girl and actually listened to her lyrics they would mean so much to you. I think she has a great voice and i can't wait for her new Cd to come out this Spring!"
1,BORING!!,"All in all I think Ashanti is ok, but this song is just soo annoying.I don't know how it became such a big hit.her voice is pleasant, but the song is boring,repetitive and sooo cliche."
1,Just Foolish,"For Ashanti, I felt very dissapointed with her very frist single, Foolish. Although she brings a little taste of soul into Murder Inc. and everything else, it feels like a remake in the middle. The song samples One More Chance by the late Notorious B.I.G. Although it seemed like a strong debut for a new singer, it falls flat on deaf ears, as a Mariah Carey wannabe. Hopefully, when her next record comes out, she'll probably show a little bit of music to call her own."
4,Its OK........,"Ashanti's 1st single ""Foolish"" is nothing at all out of the ordinary, special, unique, creative, or profound. The beat has been sampled numerous times, the story line is cliche and her voice may be smooth and sweet but it's nothing surprising. However, this single does have something in it. The beat (although DeBarge's....sampled by Biggie...) is catchy and rather haunting. The lyrics are overused but relateable. Her voice flows with the song and it's overall pretty enjoyable. This single also includes the video which is always a plus. If your wondering if this cd inclued the remix intitled ""Unfoolish"" it doesn't. But that's no matter. ""Foolish"" is much better and the remix is almost the same but with a nasty & vulgar rap by Biggie (needless to say, also sampled)."
2,Forgettable. Time for something NEW!,"Quick shots of the normal crash-bang you see at most games. Short on player comments and experience. I expected more in depth commentary from the players to balance out the presentation fluff which amounted to a lot of flash shots of guys snapping at other guys who may or may not be playing in the same game (the uniforms didn't match up). Don't try and get a full sense of what the players are doing or saying in the locker room; you'll be disappointed. This movie proves the need for a better, more in-depth, and dare I say, hard-core film on the behind-the-scenes exchanges in hockey on and off the ice."
3,Behind the scenes look at NHL,"Ok video - not too long or indepth - but pretty interesting look at behind the scenes NHL day to day player info.If you have seen the ""mic'd up"" segment on regular hockey tv where they mic up a player - I think it is like that. You get a bit of the players commentary on things but not too much."
4,ITS AWSOME BABY!!!!!!!,I SAW CLIPS OF IT AND I MUST SAY IF YOU LOVE HOCKEY THIS IS A MUST GET TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION.
3,GOOD BOOK,"This book is one of those mainstay type books. Fisch is not as succient with his effort as I would like, but I suppose that is a personal preference."
5,A wonderful look at US values,Nelson-Pallmayer paints an accurate picture of the state of affairs of the American family and offers ideas for improving our Nation for the good of all families.
3,Sherilyn Fenn loses guy to mousy blonde,Bonnie is 14 years old in the 1950s and learns to dress to enhance her brown eyes and fine blonde hair. She joins a band as a singer with her husky but of course good natured girlfriend a la The Lemon Sisters and gets to sing at a New Year's party thrown by snotty rich Italian girl who looks like a tiny perfect brunette doll and is hysterically enraged by Bonnie's wiles. Her below the radar attractiveness nets her the big man on campus (junior high school) and that's it. Toni the pretty brunette smacks Bonnie.
4,"If you liked Miss America, then you'll probably like this.","This is a soundtrack to a movie and as such had different requirements than just producing a set of songs that all fit as a coherent whole. But if you like the vocal stylings of Ms. O'Hara then get this CD. There are quite a few outstanding songs that equal the best found on Miss America. I bought the movie as well and didn't expect much of it. I was surprised, the movie is pretty funny and worth a rental. Problem is renting is out of the question unless you live in Toronto. It has practically no distribution that I could find outside of one DVD/CD store in Toronto."
1,Not complete season 2,"I faithfully watched every episode of season one and two and most of three and was very excited when these were released.That is until I bought them and reliazed they are not complete programs.Entire skits are missing and so are most of the dance routines.The one big skit is the Jim Carrey, ""White, White, Baby"", which is incredible but missing from this supposed season 2 DVD.Boycott practices like this and maybe the companies will release what we want rather than edited, censored versions that they dupe us with until after they are viewed."
4,In Living Color Season 2,"I have not watched all of it. I laughed at most of what I did watch. They refer to some TV characters of the same time period. Unless you know them, the humor is lost. Our 12 and 14 year olds don't get some of it. Of course, we skip through some skits that may be inappropriate. Overall, we love this series."
3,NO Jim Carrey / VANILLA ICE Parody!!! >:( !!!,"I only bought the second season because (I saw somewhere on line that) the Jim Carrey / Vanilla Ice skit was going to be on it. And I only bought the first season because I was buying the second season. I don't really care as much about alot of other stuff that was edited, but I am SOOOO Mad that that Vanilla Iceskit is not on there. That is like the most classic skit ever!!!"
1,Did They Think We Wouldn't Notice?,"This release should be titled, ""In Living Color: Season 2 (Edited and Modified for Your Viewing Displeasure)"". The cheapos at FOX apparently didn't want to pay for certain music rights involved in the skits so they either replaced the music or cut the skit all together (as is the case with The Jim Carrey Vanilla Ice skit). What an underhanded move by Fox. I consider this false advertising. It's not Season 2. It's MOST of Season 2, MODIFIED. I LOVE ""IN LIVING COLOR"". This review is based on this DVD RELEASE ONLY. I am very disappointed and would advise others to avoid purchasing. Maybe FOX will get the message and do a re-release, but don't hold your breath. I've really lost respect for Fox and its Home Entertainment Division. They could have, at the very least, acknowledged the modifications on the DVD packaging."
5,Hilarious DVD Set,"Very funny, I was laughing to the point of tears. Since this season ended with cliffhangers in the last episode you can be sure the Season 3 DVD is coming soon"
5,YES THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR,I can not wait for ILC SEASON 2 TO COME OUT BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN WAITING TO SAY THIS FOR A WHILE BUT SEASON 2 IS WAY BETTER THAN SEASON 1 AND PROBABLY THE BEST SEASON I CAN NOT WAIT
2,Great Plot; Poor Execution,"Ok - picture this: Reform minded big city police commissioner selects a trusted policy wonk to aid him in cleaning up the force. Wonk, the ""Man With A Gun,"" dives in with both feet, and finds himself immersed in the jealousy, intrigue, and bureacracy that is a force filled with career officers. Wonk screws up by forgetting that he is not a cop, and it takes more than a badge and a gun to become one. Suspicious career officers don't help him, and set him up for failure instead. Add a streetwise police sargent as advisor, a hot and experienced mistress, and some political intrigue, and you've got yourself the makings of a great book. Someone besides Daly should have written it. I picked this up on the strength of the excellent movie Prince of the City (starring Treat Williams), which was based on a Daley novel. Well, one movie doesn't mean that the other book is so hot. Great plot and ideas - just embarrassingly stupid storytelling in places. Skip it."
4,Good Stuff,I love the music. I wish David Wilke would find someone else to sing the vocals he sings - his voice just does not fit with the rest of the music.
4,Cantonese?,Is this newly released DVD really in Cantonese? The original movie was made in Taiwan in Mandarin with some Taiwanese. The coastal scenery of Taiwan was spectacular. I want to buy the DVD because I liked the movie but not if it doesn't have Mandarin.
4,Not quite Hair of the Dog,"If you're a die-hard Hair of the Dog fan, you'll probably be a little disappointed with Rick's solo disc. It's a lot more country than Irish. But don't despair, there are some HOTD favorites here, including a few songs from the ""Let it Flow"" live recording concerts. Crank up ""I used to work in Chicago"", pour yourself a Guinness, and you almost think you're in the audience at the Parting Glass. Well, maybe it'll take 2 Guinnesses, hahaha."
5,I highly recommend this book !,"Here is a book written by a very believable grandmother of two Oklahoma City Bombing victims. Kathy has done a stalwart job of researching the OKC bombing and she presents several unanswered and very credible questions about the U.S. government's inept investigation of this case. After Oklahoma City is a culmination of Ms. Sanders becoming stronger, wiser and more passionate for the truth surrounding the death of her two grandsons; whom she dearly loved. Kathy's journey over the past ten years has strengthened her and her family in many ways unimaginable at the time of the bombing.This book will help you learn that there is much more to the OKC bombing case than what we have been told during the past ten years. The woefully incorrect information offered by the U.S. Government is simply unacceptable.We need more people like Kathy Sanders to take a stand for the truth. I highly recommend reading this book."
5,Safety covers - Adult proof,"I had to purchase these according to State code for me to watch my grand kids. I don't know why they think these as child protections of the electrical outlets...Little kids can pry this out in a second, whereas adults can't. But as I am required to have them in, they are, and when I need to use an outlet...yah, my grand kids have to help Grandma pull the cover off."
4,Security wallet,"This wallet will do the job, but is a bit stiff on first use. With time I am hoping it become more flexible. The combination credit card slots are a nice touch."
3,Wish it came with a wiring diagram,"Bought this to replace a ceiling fan switch that I broke. The old switch had 5 wires, and the fan has 3 speeds and an off position as well. (4 position switch)This switch was described as having 3 speeds and an of position, just like the old one, but it has only 3 wires?There was no wiring diagram, included with the item, and a web search yielded a very vague diagram from the manufacturer.Don't buy unless you know exactly what you're doing.I managed to install but I only have 2 speeds now, and two unused wires."
2,Low level recording,"Giovanni Martinelli was supposed to have been the best Manrico. The samples on this Cd support this conclusion. Unfortunately, this Cd is filled with many wholes where the music just fades away for seconds. The overall result is anger with Pearl not to have fixed this problem or at least warned about. Reiner Kollrack"
4,Only cable that worked perfectly,"Minus 1 star for the price. I picked this cable up for $130, cheapest I could find. I have several 25'-50' DMI cables that I paid between $18-$50 each. They all deliver perfect signals to LCDs 42"" and under. I recently added two 52"" Samsung LCDs in 2 different conference rooms...unfortunately the same generic HDMI cables I already purchased caused random flickering and inconsistent screen redraws...also tested with multiple video cards with same results.Long story short I reluctantly paid triple the cash for this Monster Cable HDMI400 50' cable and the signal came in perfectly when testing on both 52"" Samsung LCD monitors...I just purchased a second one for $179. Hate the price but love the results."
3,"boring, boring, boring","A most boring recital, Sutherland in droopy voice in all slow arias, and I mean sloooow. Don't know what she was trying to do here. Her voice is golden but shere boredom here."
2,Uneven,"As with many ""various artists"" CDs, this one is a mixed bag. Seven different artists perform a total of 26 tracks. The performances by The Steve Meisner Band and by Karl and the Country Dutchmen (such as Karl's Bad Schottische -- get it?) are superb, and those by Vatra and by the Clete Bellin Orchestra are acceptable. The others either have a whiney sound or are lacking in the bass department. In the polka field, it is better to stick with single-artist CDs by the better performers. Recordings by Frankie Yankovic, Joey Miskulin, Eddie Blazonczyk, Walter Ostanek, Fred Ziwich, and Jimmy Sturr will provide a much better foundation for your polka collection than this CD."
2,not very good...,i've read close to 100 outlines on bible prophecy. 'watcher's a sincere but sadly poor guide. the information's winded. sorry marilyn hickey.
1,Best cure for Insomnia,"The writer attempts to explain if his brother's life was worth living because he ended it so badly. He never answers some basic questions such as ""Why did his brother only live with his grandmother"" and ""what made him so distant to his family"". Why the writer chooses to go into such length about the history of the thermometer and the cosmos is beyond me. This book was chosen for my bookclub because of the previous comments and star rating. It should have been a hint to me how bad the book was when no library carried it, and I tried 2 major bookstores plus 3 department store and could only get this book by ordering it. Buy this book if you have trouble sleeping because out of 5 members of my club I was the only one who finished it and it took me forever!"
4,3 Rows Pyramid Stud Punk Spike Gothic Leather Belt Black,I bought the Med size and it took 4 days to get here...fits good im a size 29-30 so the med fit pretty good. the buckle is non-removable but that doesnt matter to me. anyways im satisfied ~ 4/5
1,UNLESS you can persuade me to the contrary...,"You will find this book really boring and rambling. I can't figure out what the other reviewers rave about. UNLESS ""gets to the point"" (you are asking for it to get to ANY POINT throughout the book) near the very end of the book. ""It"" all comes together at that point. This is not a moving or profound read, in my opinion. A much better book is ""The Glass Castle."""
1,Useless,"Aweful! I can't force myself to finish reading it! Completely self indulgent, a writer writing about being a writer.....BORING! The story line of the daughter living on a street corner is interesting, but 1/3 of the way through this book and really nothing is said about the daughter! I loved Stone Diaries. I hate Unless!"
2,Boring Book---I Expected Better,"I thought a Pulitzer Prize winning novel would bring me something new and insightful, but frankly, this was one of the most boring books I've ever read. I didn't care about the characters, the end was predictable, and there was way too much filler."
3,Not impressed,"I really wanted to like this book, but I could never really get into it.I don't believe that the characters were well developed. I didn't have any emotional connections to Reta, Tom, or even her kids.I will try other books of the author, but to me, this book did not compell me to keep reading."
2,Relaxation and Breathing,"I was excited to get this cassette, but after listening to it twice, I was a little disappointed. This audiobook mainly focuses on breathing, stretching and relaxing exercises. I wanted to hear more about the issues of Co-Dependency and that is covered briefly on the first side, but then it is more about loving yourself, relaxing, breathing, stretching, etc. I got more out of Melodie Beattie's book - ""Co-Dependency No More""."
5,For when your step ladder Bottoms rip,The rubber bottoms on my perfectly good step stool ripped and the unprotected legs were damaging my wooden floors and the marble in my kitchen. I used these to place over the old ones (which I couldn't get off) and it worked out lovely.
2,Required reading,"Why did my eyes fill with tears the first time I read this book? Every one of us has parts of ourselves we are cut off from, parts we sometime even try to be rid of. This wonderful story, so charmingly illustrated, simply reminds us to embrace ourselves, even those troublesome parts that can sometimes redeem us."
2,I hope you like green,"I bought this because it had Ann Dvorak,but it is BAD,dull,I made it about halfway and gave up,plus its mostly tinted green for God knows why!"
1,AUDIO GARBAGE...PRIDELESS TRASH,"Don't bother. Worst audio quality since the 78 record. Says MADE IN CANADA. Great, lousy music from Canada AND they (and France!) want us to fight all their wars. Hey Canada, your beer sucks TOO!"
5,Excellent storytelling with good Regency flair,"I read so many regency's lately and they all seem to be classifiable. This one is not. While losing none of the flavour of a regency without prosing on and on about carriages or la belle assemble patterns, Ms. Roberts brings just enough colour from the regency period, enhancing the story at the right moments and at the right places.The characters are wonderful. Sedge is dreamy and without a doubt believable. Georgiana is maybe a little too flighty once and awhile, but the writing is done so cleverly, I found myself forgiving her for this.Ms. Roberts has a wonderful way with words and I will definitely be seeking out more of her books!"
2,Like Nails on a Blackboard,"The first listen may have fooled me, but after careful consideration I know that there's no talent here."
5,Awesome sounds!,"If you're looking for some high quality independent music, look no further than Living Soul and the Pearl Divers! Don Middlebrook is a great talent out of Michigan, and having had the opportunity to see him live numerous times, this band is one of my favorites. Pick up this CD and you won't be able to put it down!"
4,"Spare, lean sparkles of poetry","Milad has a unique voice that breathes through the poetry of this first collection. Many of the poems have been carefully polished to sparkle with poetic insight. Milad's verse isn't difficult to absorb, and slightly more than half of the poems reward close reading. The other half are plain, but not prosaic or pointless. I look forward to a second collection, when the verbal rawness matures, and Milad serves up more music for the heart."
4,Wonderful performance,"Despite its being explicitly recycled material, and Verdi's having reached that point where one sometimes thinks he only has a few basic tunes that he uses over and over again, this recording is a delight. Carreras is at his silvery best, showing that he could be a superlative Verdi tenor and Ricciarelli gives a most memorable performance. Until near the end the live audience is kept well out of it, though towards the end the clapping does interfere with the music. The lack of a libretto is highly regrettable, especially as one is not likely to have any other versions."
5,My 3 month old loves it!!!,"I know that the product states this is for children 6m+ but I put my 3 month old in it and he LOVES it. He can't sit up in it yet, but it is soft and he leans against the back. He can't turn the key but I'm there to do it for him. He grabs the steering wheel and is fascinated by the lights and sounds from the dash board. He kicks his feet with excitement. I think this toy is great, and so does my son!"
2,Glad I got it for free,"Don't get me wrong. It is a nice place to set DS down, and it does keep him entertained for a while; however it wasn't until I read some other posts about it that I learned the 'ignition' plays music. I've had it for over 6 montsh and all this time I thought it only honked, and even that was a challenge to get it to work! I had to feel around in the 'ignition' to discover there was a tiny button there. The activation buttons are so small and unresponsive it's a wonder they ever worked. I still can't get the music going using the 'key.' I'm glad it was given to me 'cause it's not worth the money. It's a shame because this could have been a great product!"
2,Cute toy but doesn't do much,We got this for our daughter when she was about 6 months old. It never held her interest and she didn't even care to sit in it. 6 months later and she still doesn't like it. It's very floppy and the key is nearly impossible to turn without force. My 3 year old can't even turn the key. I wouldn't buy it again.
2,"My kids like it, I don't.","We received this as a baby gift a few years ago. It is still in regular use. It's adorable, but I hate that my kids have such a hard time turning it on. The music and lights are activated by these tiny buttons hidden under a felt layer. The felt moves around occasionally, so the button is hard to find. Forget using the ignition key to turn on the music. It took two years for us to realize that the horn actually makes noise. Our son managed to hit the button by mistake. It is virtually impossible to press the button through the stuffed bear on the steering wheel. I would really like this car if I wasn't obligated to sit down and press the button for my kids every fifteen seconds when they want to play with it. In my opinion, if I have to own an electronic noisy toy, it had better occupy my kids while I am in another room where I don't have to listen to it.It does work well as a support for a soon-to-be sitting child, but I personally prefer a boppy pillow."
1,COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY & BIG PIECE OF UGLY JUNK,"This shouldn't even be called a toy. It is just a big waste of space ( not to mention a lot of money). There's nothing baby can do with it! I hardly ever write reviews, but I just had to save someone from making the same mistake I made."
2,not happy,"I bought it for my 8 month old grandson, thinking it would be ideal for him, to sit up and watch what was going on, but it offers no back support at all, we put him in it and he just fell backwards, so was a lot of money spent and he can.t use it"
4,Works well w/ my Olympus SP-570UZ,"Olympus SP-570UZ 10MP Digital Camera with 20x Optical Dual Image Stabilized ZoomNice snug fit, and compact for easy carry. Room in top zippered compartment for extra batteries. Room in back zippered compartment for USB cable.Only negative, plastic carry strap clips and plastic loops on carry case. Nervous about plastic potentially breaking and camera falls to pavement. Does come with one of those metal mountain climber clips, so I took carry strap from my old case w/ it's metal clips and did it that way so all metal."
3,Tight Fit!,Nice bag but a little too small for my camera even though it specified use with my model.
3,A little on the small side,The bag is a tight fit for my SP-570 that this bag was supposedly designed for.
2,Not very big!!!!,"Olympus 202132 nylon camera bag.It's not very big, can't put much but a camera in there.great speed in getting product delivered!!!!! usps is so much faster than ups"
4,Review Olympus case,It met my expectations. I wasn't looking for a large bag just one to protect the camera and it does
4,Blowing the whistle on government denial of UFOs,"FASTWALKERS provides well researched documentation exposing the base motives of those responsible for the mass propaganda that has kept us misinformed as to the true nature of our relationship to the intergalactic beings becoming more and more visible in our skies. This movie is a good step toward uncovering the lies that have us enslaved to polluting energy sources and fear-based aggression that only serve our so called leaders. Great information, very heartening, in spite of the annoying and distracting sound track."
1,So. Terribly. Bad.,"This was so awful. I can't spend my time elaborating, so don't waste yours. I am acutually a very forgiving viewer, and I almost never share an opinion via the internet. This was so bad, I'm really speechless."
2,very boring,this movie is not what i expected and the whole movie is only entertaining for a specific range of people.
1,Production quality made me laugh - not ponder life from out there.,"Ok, I know you are starting with a concept that has been around for 50 years and is very popular with the viewing public. But, please pick these types of pseudo-documentaries with a little care. This one is really bad. The X Files (fiction) did it better. Better still forget trying to find the ""truth"" and continue to provide some great fictional stories about aliens like ""Falling Skies"". By the way, thank you Prime for showing Falling Skies."
2,Couldn't get past the first 5 minutes,This seems to need a little help and wasn't anything that looked worth suffering through more than the intro. Sorry guys - better luck next time!
3,U.F.O.s rule!,"This is a good documentary. Fastwalkers looks at some provocative footage and eye witness accounts. They are here, believe that!"
3,More UFO discussion,"Nothing new here, more talk of how Uncle Sam is hiding the obvious from us.Still I did enjoy the story's of a few people interviewed. Listening to some old guy telling you he sat next to an alien during a meeting in 1967 that was wearing a white lab coat is something almost believable.I was hoping for a little more video and interviews about these craft but it was mostly about the government hiding the facts.If you can buy this DVD cheap then it's worth watching."
2,More like Semi-Remarkable Battles,"This title is ok to borrow from your local public library, but do not pay $25 for this. This is a 50 minute episode of the History Channel series The Most. While many of the battles and military commanders recounted here are intersting, apporximatley 1/3 are not and really do not belong with the others. Segments such as Carrier Pidgeons, the U.S. Camel Cavalry Corp and Roman Collesium Naval Contests are not even in the same league as the segments on The Jutland, Battle for Berlin and Alexander the Great and thus detract from the overall DVD."
1,avoid if you're a fan of the original,"While the original appealed to adults and kids, this series seems more directed at kids and younger adults with a younger central cast, but with lazy insipid story lines that don't really integrate the Ultraman character as a person and superhero and loses the charm of the earlier science patrol actors. And though the special effects are marginally better (there was no CGI possible back in the 60s obviously), the effects are inferior and cheap looking by today's standards. As a result, the wacky over the top fun of the monster fights is gone."
1,Why didn't they include the english dub as an option?,"How sad for the smaller kids that the powers that be chose not to include an english dubbing! A FoxBox version DVD would be the best version for the kids, but alas, not available- WHY???"
5,great humor as always,"As usual, Martha Bolton offers humor and fun with a message! Either I was smiling, laughing out loud or nodding in agreement about her humorous take on getting older. Her words encouraged me to know I'm not alone and to grow older with grace and joy!"
3,Cooking with Hot Flashes,A light read. Humor mixed with the truth of getting older and all that women must deal with in the process.
4,A rare and telling glimpse inside Chechen culture,"""Immortal Fortress"" is a rare look into a culture completely closed from foreigners. In light of the current conflict exploding in Chechnya, this film is an important story of a culture, its struggles, and its attitudes towards war told from the people themselves. While viewers leave the film with an increased understanding and sympathy for the Chechen's desire for independence, as well as a sense of awe for their David-and-Goliath-type victory, Mr. Billingsley manages to maintain an objective balance. Though the only voices heard are those of the Chechens, it is their own brutality and hatred that condemns them-- speaking of the inhumanity of the Russians on one hand, then jovially describing their own brutal acts with pride. The danger faced by the filmmaker in entering Chechnya is a worthy story in itself, bested only by the journalistic importance of the story he came out with."
2,Disappointing...,"I was hoping for two things when I bought this video...one, to be emotionally moved and two, to attain decent quality archival footage. I received neither. Although there is a lot of footage, the editing is a bit fast and chaotic with an addition of cheesy (and overdone) video effects to ""heighten"" the intensity. I found the film to be both patronizing and pretty pretentious. Its a pity...there's quite an opportunity for a real heartwrenching, ""war is bad"" theme but instead I saw something that felt like propaganda."
3,"""Chechen Tactic, No Tactic""","Great movie, I only say this because it's just about the only documentary I have ever seen on this war. Theres maybe all together 3 minutes of actual combat footage in this film. I was really impressed that this film maker did make it out of there with his head still attached to his body. Chechens are notorious for kidnapping.I was dissapointed in the fact that they rarely discussed tactics, the only one I recall is about street fighting, and how the Chechens would find two Russian squads at both ends of a street and one of them would run through the middle and fire in both directions and the Russians would end up shooting at each other for 30 minutes...they only realized they were fighting there comrades when they called in for artillery fire. I thought that was amazing."
2,Disappointing,"Simplistic bit of propaganda. The journalist who put this together was clearly won over by the Chechen cause, but the result is not particularly insightful or informative. Perhaps a good introduction for those who know nothing about the conflict, but not much good for anything more."
1,A Waste of Wood Pulp,"This book is another example of ""scholars"" cashing in on popular culture. The back of the book calls the authors ""all well-respected scholars,"" yet many of them are graduate students who have never published before! The book is also full of obivous factual errors that any serious student of the X-Files will recognize immediately. As an X-Files fan and an academic, I am both disappointed and offended by the poor quality of this book. The one part of the book worth reading is the intriguing Lacanian analysis in the last article, but that alone does not begin to justify the publication of the book. The X-Files deserves a serious scholarly examination--this is not it"
1,"Superficial, Pseudo-Scholarly, Skippable","I was hoping for a deep and detailed analysis of some of the themes that run through the X-Files. I did not find it in this book. I found an ill-assorted set of disjoined essays on various aspects of the show, lacking even the depth of insight of a moderately erudite fan. Definitely skip this book."
1,"NewGenInc is a ""bait and switch"" seller","Ordered the Verbatim cartridge advertised and they sent a generic white box unbranded replacement cartridge that I could probably buy elsewhere for $25. Paid a premium for the Verbatim because none has ever failed in my office. I posted a photo above of the item NewGeninc sent. First time I've been ""baited and switched"" in Amazon.com. Email from Newgeninc essentially said it was a suitable replacement. No deal."
4,It Prints!,Works fine. Ships quick. Overall 4 to 5 stars. Not sure what more I can say about a black and white printer cartridge.
2,Not True to Size,"I normally wear large or extra large, so I ordered extra large to make sure I would have enough room. It's too tight. It may look good on Christen, but not on me. Otherise, it's just another sweater. I don't know why anyone would love, love, love it, but to each his (or her) own."
5,Nice Sweater!,"I bought this for my husband very late for an ""on time"" Christmas delivery, but it arrived the day before. :) It is a very nice sweater and perfect for my husbands needs. He wears it to work over many of his shirts. He could not be happier!"
3,Its okay,"Not very great quality, lacks warmth. The price was fair but if you are looking for thickness and body warming pay a little more."
3,it's not a bad show but its not great either,"I've watched both seasons of noahs arc. And during the time that I have watched the show and the movie. The one thing that I did gather from it was how over the top and over dramatic some of the characters were. The show seemed like it should be on the WB. And seemed like it was written for teenagers. I personally think if the writers would have gone a little bit more in-depth with the story line, and made it a little less over dramatic, the show may still be on today. It sucks that it was taken off the air to early,cause all in all it's not a bad show it just needed a little bit more work."
5,Can't get enough!,I didn't know anthing about this series until I saw an advertisement on a website. Started watching the second season on LOGO and knew I had to see it from the beginning. Love Noah and his friends! Watched all the DVDs in one day and will watch it over and over again!
3,Not edgy enough,"It's fun, but with more stereotypes than I expected. The pilot (included in one of the discs) is much better. It's a shame they didn't continue the same edge in the other chapters. I'm glad I bought it, and I will probably buy the coming seasons but not as enthusiastically as I did with QAF."
2,Noah's ARC is racist and stereotypical farce,"First of allAfter the first few episodes you began to realize that Noah and his friends are freakish looking, stereotypes which hold no basis in reality."
2,"very, very....hypnotic...car wreck hypnotic","i try to support black film and tv ventures (because i'm black)but sometimes i want to slit my wrists...noah's arc is a brave attempt to bring black men in love and gay black men into the realm of a white world. i'm not sure if it's the writing or the acting or both that make this show a guilty pleasure. queer as folk had its moments of schlock and cheesy perfomances but noah's is very melodramatic and much like an after-school special or worse, some tv-movie on lifetime. i look forward to seeing growth in season two and hopefully, they get rid of the term ""boo-gina""...ick!!!"
2,Noah's rejects,"Bad acting, poor story line- and the worst of it all it's the [bad] actors are not even good looking. What gives!!!"
4,great show because but,"great show because its something that men of color can relate to and enjoy, i rated it a 4 and not a 5 because theres still a lot of improvement and kinks that should be taken care of"
5,great TV show,First saw it when I was livin in Boston back in 2005. Pity it was cancelled after the second season!
4,Didn't think it was possible,"After watching and loving every minute of Queer as folk, I was not sure that a ""funny"" show who is suppose to depict gay life would live up to the standards that i have been use too. But from the first time I sat down and watched Noah's arc I was hooked it was a great mix of comedy with real sense of who the characters are. There are times when the acting could be better but that's with everything. I would tell you to run out and buy this season."
3,kinda torn between...,"I purchased this set the other day and I pretty much got through it in a day (since the season is so short) and I have mixed feelings about whether I like it or not (hence the 3 stars).On one hand, it's fun, campy and has lots of sexy men flaunting themselves. There are times that it's funny and it does help bring out the fact that there are gay black men out there who are just as fabulous as everyone else.On the other hand, there can be a lot of criticism about the show. The acting is kinda average and tedious at times. It's a bit wooden and the script has needs a bit of work to make it feel more 'real'. The characters were predictable and it's hard to compare it to Queer as Folk or Sex and the City because it really tries to be those two moulded together but doesn't quite get there.Nonetheless, I did enjoy many moments and hope they improve on what's lacking in the next season."
3,Why did Logo cancel its only black program?,"Noah's Arc tried to do so many things too fast, probably knowing its time was limited!I don't think Patric ian-Polk realized this mish-mash of Sex and the City, All My Children, and whatever made-for-television storylines were culled from, would make such a splash in the black gay community, it did, but I thought the acting was so overblown, the characterizations paper thin, the plots so been there, done that, and plots were seemingly dropped...Despite all the buzz from film festivals, I purchased this item with such high expectations!if anything, purchase this for the novelty that it is and move on. To its credit, Noah's Arc is soooo much better than The Closet, any edition!"
5,Gay Life at Its Best,Noah's Arc is definitely a bigg thriller when it comes to gay life.There's a lot of insight on what didn't make it on LOGO as well making it even more of a thriller.
1,Bad sprayer,"Twice I have purchased this sprayer (from retail stores), and in both cases it didn't even last long enough to finish a one gallon can of WD40.On the first sprayer, the pump stuck in and wouldn't return when the lever was released. On the second sprayer, the check valves inside stuck open so it wouldn't pump/spray anything out. It's pretty sad that the WD40 sprayers didn't last more than a couple of months of use with WD40 lubricant."
2,WD-40 Spray Applicator is not reusable,I have purchased these bottles before and I needed a couple more. I prefer using them to a pressure can. But these new bottle tops screw on a a way that you can't unscrew them. That means I can use the bottle once and then must throw it away.
4,A girl and her bear,"It appears that ""The Bear Seeds"" is this author's only book; but it is fun and imaginative children will enjoy it, I think. Mary really wants a bear, and one day at church, the minister is replaced by a clown and trained bear. She is apparently only one of two people who can see it; the other is a woman who is just visiting, and gives Mary three bear seeds. Only one seed grows, but Mary soon has a bear, Custer. They spend time together during the summer and he follows her to school and eventually beats up a bully for her. Her mother and father eventually seem to see and accept the bear. Custer gets lonely after Mary reads to him about Teddy Roosevelt's bears. Mary takes him to a visiting circus, where he meets his clown, and he goes off to see the world. Plot room was left for a second book, but I haven't heard of one."
2,Better left untold stories for your kitschy heart,"I've tried to read Solnit over the years but her disjointed view of the ecological and other problems facing the US-- and past critiques of how to solve them-- just hang there, like a phantom in the dark, as I read.In past works she's vehemently against WALMART, but for the 'latinoization' of the US' as a way of reinjecting political serum into the body politic. Rebecca, where do you think a lot of latinos--legal land illegal--work and shop to help break U.S. consumer consumption records?She's against the 'racists' in the Sierra Club who want stricter immigration control, yet she's silent on the 'no-longer a white elephant' population issue that's helping to destroy her beloved West.If you can get over the twice-chewed romantic stories of 'hope' in this one, you may find possibilities in this book. I found a yawner."
1,Utter Disappointment,"This book is a complete disappointment from preface to index.If you're a math-geek who's intent is to design a network analyzer, this book may be for you. However, if your intent is to design-in an OpAmp and make it work, buy any other text out there.If you're used to the ol' -Rf/Ri (inverting) or 1+Rf/Ri (non-inverting) formulas for amplifier designs, you'll be as dumbfounded as I was when you see how the author spins the formulas around into expressions that are completely unusable for quick estimation. The author assumes we (as engineers) don't have access to network analyzers or software circuit simulators, and still keep slide-rules in our top-drawer.Additionally, the author's sections on PCB layout is esoteric and not much help beyond the obvious.Get yourself a decent OpAmp ""cookbook"", you'll learn far more from a ""this is how they did it"" approach than this author's methodology."
1,Not so good,"I purchased this material to use as a sun blocker on the top portion of motorcycle helmet visors. The material would not stay attached to the inside of the visor -- it's rather stiff, not especially clingy. Would not recommend it for this application."
1,DO NOT BUY! FALSE ADVERTISING. NOT STATIC CLING,I bought this product because it was reusable and removable. However they sent normal tint. They apologized and sent a replacement and it was again the same product and wrong item. I am extremely disappointed that Amazon is indeed falsely advertising Static Cling tint and sending normal tint twice!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
2,UK enthusiasts regurgitate old news,"The book is poorly organized and makes itself a boring read through instead of a reference guide. Usually these bonsai books bring some new things to the table: pictures, new techniques. This book is fluff. I thought I was going to get a specialized view of deciduous and coniferous tress and what you actually get is ""I recommend reading this fine book ""so and so"" on air layering."" What a let down. Buy it used and cheap as there are some specimens worth looking at. Otherwise just another brick on the wall."
2,More German Economics than Goering Bio,"While this book may be considered a biography it deals more with German economics and Luftwaffe related events than with the actual life of Hermann Goering.If you are expecting a bio along the lines of Padfield's exhaustive ""Himmler"" or Kershaw's masterful ""Hitler: Hubris"" or ""Hitler: Nemesis"" forget it, this isn't for you. There are other Goering Bios that do a much better job of fleshing out the life of their subject than this relatively short book.This book does do a passable job of covering Goering's war years and his influence on ,and failure of, the Third Reich."
5,Beautiful and classic,I love these plates. The are beautiful and lightweight. My old dinnerware was stoneware and I hated how bulky and heavy they were. If you are debating on this pattern on the french countryside get this one....much lighter and more durable than stoneware.
3,third row,"My last review for Weathertech mats. 1st of all this third row fits fine. For the price one has to cough up, i think the quality could be better. The rubber seems equal to the ones you can get at any auto parts store for a third less. I know they have to pay for the molds and the 20 page ads in the magazines, but for what you get, the price does not match. Lets see what they're like in a few years with the kids and their stuff."
4,Beautiful music,"This CD is beautiful...however, what I was looking for was more of the pure pipe music, and less of other instruments. I was also hoping for more quiet, reflective pieces, and found that much of the music was quite perky. But, absolutely wonderful...can't really complain. I would, however, like to purchase one of his cd's that has more restful tunes."
3,Sleepy Music,"Celtic influenced new age, a bit boring really, but may be OK for fans of bands life Wolfstone."
3,The Babysitters,Was a movie for a rainy day. Acting was good liked Kathrine Waterson one small nude scene.
4,titillating morality play...,"I saw this on Shotime and bought a copy for my wife, who has yet to see it. John Leguizamo is a fun actor to watch. We saw him in an off-broadway play something like seventeen years ago. It's a wild movie."
1,Not so interesting.,Some take on middle aged white male fantasies. Not too much dept or development of any characters other than stereotypical cliche. A very trite and moralistic fantasy portrayal with nothing new or moving. I can not recommend.
2,Ehhhh,"OK premise, if somewhat cliched. Unfortunately, the acting left a lot to be desired. Horrible waste of John Leguizamos' talents. Can't say that I'd recommend this movie to anybody (that I liked anyway)!"
2,average movie,"this movie certainly had a lot to offer but came out short. if you're going to make a adult-themed movie, then go for it. having sex scenes with everyone fully clothed does nothing for the movie. it's not my main complaint or major concern, but it is more distracting than anything. i doubt if teenagers are that organized or can keep a secret especially with all the business, money and backstabbing that was going on. their business would of collapsed long before it did. and it would not only be the kids that noticed high buck jewerly and clothes on them. i really don't think the leguizamo character would really have the caring and feelings he did. i didn't think much of the acting or characters played. and yes, common sense giving teenagers drugs and alcohol will come back to haunt you. nothing really happened, which i'm sure is a relief to the characters. if this movie would have been made in any other nonpolitically correct decade, it might have been done differently."
4,both painful and good at the same time,"This deals with teen prostitution, manages to do so without being overly exploitive or sugarcoating the topic-- a rare successful entry into the area of being truthful without veering too far off on either side. The actors are great, manage to stay in character and on topic, the photography and sound are acceptable, and it's worth the time and effort to buy it, watch it, think about it, and watch it again.Then it's time to pass it on, but only to thinking adults, not to idiots who are only interested in ""getting off their rocks."""
1,Didn't finish watching it.....terrible,Bad PlotTerrible ActingJust not watchable.It's a shame as I like most of the known actors in this movie.
3,movie,i was hoping it would be better than itwasd iwould not buy the movie at all thanks for letting me watch
3,Trashy But Amusing,"Comparisons with ""Risky Business"" are valid. These young people are just sort of drifting into wild behavior without much thought to where it all may lead. There could have at least been an STD, a pregnancy, or a violent injury somewhere along the line, as these would be a given in real life. Luckily it's handled as more of a ""what if"" than ""based on real events."""
4,Worth a watch,"This movie was pretty realistic to me but a little over dramatized. We all know prostitution is not very common in the US and definitley not socially accepted like it is in many countries. But this movie shows how American girls could easily get into sex for money and how the middle-aged men of the area would go crazy for it. Realistic in premise but a little exaggerated. It's funny how the nice innocent girl turned into a psycho controlling pimp. And it was pretty wild to see who was the man who came out of the vehile at the end. I dont think this movie answers any moral questions, it just is what it is. Fairly entertaining. This movie could be off-putting to conservative viewers, mothers of teen girls or wives to middle aged men!"
5,I liked it.,"Both the guy and girl are taught a good lesson. Wasn't boring and keep my attention all throughout the movie. Sex, sex, sex."
5,Amazing!!,"Maybe a more detailed review to come later, but I'm excited so this is a quick little review filled with my euphoria. Songwriter Leslie Satcher totally delivers. The highlight tracks include ""Love Letters From Old Mexico,"" (backed by the lighter than air harmonies of Alison Krauss and Emmylou Harris), ""Burn me Down,"" ""Every Time It Rains,"" ""Texarkana,"" and her excellent cover of ""Ode to Billie Joe."" She breaks the streak of songwriters putting out subpar versions of their own music, and this should be a sweet breath of fresh air for Nashville. Proof that songwriters can sing their own music, and quite well. You probably haven't heard of Leslie Winn Satcher, but you will soon---get this and be a trendsetter!"
4,Saw her live,"At the Grand Ole Opry and she really stood out. High energy, tight harmony, star power. I didn't know who she was but asked for the CD when it came out. Always like to see people interpret their own music, over covers.Do see her live if you can. Good production values on the CD BTW."
4,great comp. from these forgotten death metal kings with a excellent slayer cover to boot!,these guys were allways were one of my favorite old school death metal bands reminding me alot of slayer in some ways.this comp. is a great intro for people to get a taste of the early legendary years of malevolent creations first 3 cds most consider the only one that matter but to take it a step further M.C. pull out the big guns and cover slayers raining blood masterfully second only to slayer themselves brutal!
1,Napkin Holder,"This is just the one I wanted, it is easy to fill for the busy mother. Handy size too, cooler goes with every kitchen"
1,Cheaply made and noisy,"I read and looked so many napkin holder before I chose this. I was disappointed with only having three feet at the bottom instead of four because it wobbles. Also, the bar in the middle makes a lot of noise by hitting the sides of the bar holder when you walk the wooden floor (I keep this on the eating table). If I bought this in the store near me, I would return this."
4,An elegant design - with a poorly fitting lid,"I had a white version of this mug for a long time, so there were no surprises with this one, except that I especially like the cobalt blue color. This product is an elegant alternative to paper, plastic, styrofoam, or metal travel mugs. And it fits well in every cup holder I've tried it in.When I broke my original one, I immediately looked for a replacement. I was a little taken aback by the price, but I didn't really hesitate. After using this mug, I had to downgrade my assessment (from 5 stars) because the lid fits poorly, which was not a problem with my original mug."
4,Another good one in my bag of tricks!,I am a good amateur baker and had great fun with this handy tool that helped me make fancy lines around my red velvet cake. Easy to use though you must be carefully due to the sharp edges.
2,Not great quality,"Icing comb had minor defects/damage which causes a slight ripple on the smooth side. Other than that, it seems like a good tool."
3,super small,"I was a little disappointed in the size of this item, I guess the picture is a bit deceiving. Anyway, there is not much space in between the grooves so Im not exactly sure how this is going to look when I use it on my cakes, but I haven't tried it yet. Just expected it to be a bit bigger."
5,So easy to use,"Cleans easily in the dishwasher.For those of us who have a problem with decorating, this is wonderful and makes the cakes look a little more professionally done."
3,icing comb,it was ok. not as nice as i would have liked it to be. but still it will get the job done
3,Not what I expected,I was expecting a much larger tool - I am happy with the steel part of this tool but I was expecting it to be longer. Over all will use this but I am still on a quest to find a longer one for my higher cakes.
3,Average,"Irena did something good however, I wanted to know how the hidden children are doing and did they return back to their original religion and it never stated how well the nuns treated them. Having been taught by nuns in grade school, they were scary and mean."
4,chain saw sharpener,I an very please with the chain saw sharpener. The only problem that I have with it is the instructions are quite hard to understand. If they were cleared I would have given it 5 stars.
4,Oregon 511A,"Other than poor assembly instructions,that everyone else has pointed out, it is a great tool. My only suggestion to improve it would be to make the angle settings ratcket so you could be assured that you have it exactly on the degree mark you desire."
4,WHAT I THINK,"THE GRINDER WORKS VERY GOOD. I AM IMPRESSED WITH HOW FAST I CAN SHARPEN A CHAIN. IT TOOK A LITTLE THINKING AND COMMON SENSE TO FIGURE IT OUT, THE INSTRUCTION ARE USELESS. THE ONLY THING I DONT LIKE ABOUT THIS GRINDER IS IT DOESNT HAVE A BLADE LOK, SO YOU CAN HOLD THE SHAFT AND CHANGE THE BLADE. YOU HAVE TO TAKE ALL THE SAFTY SHEILDS OFF AND HOLD THE SHAFT WITH A PAIR OF PLIERS. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU NEED THE SAME BLADE ALL THE TIME, BUT I HAVE 2 HUSKY SAWS AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT SIZE. OVER ALL THIS IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE. I SPENT TWICE THIS AMOUNT IN THE PAST 5 YEARS HAVING THEM SHARPENED AT A LOCAL LAWNMOWER SHOP."
3,Oregon 511AX saw chain bench grinder,"Well built unit, however overlly complicated. Instructions are terrible. If you use any chain other than the ""oregon"" brand you will need to either call the manufacture or chainsaw dealer for angle settings. If you know a commercial timber faller better yet."
4,instruction manual for 511ax sharpener,"I just bought a oregon 511ax sharpener from Amazon. I bought the oregon because of the name and known quality. I have read many reviews complaining about the manual. I will agree with these complaints, however I really believe the mistake is that the instruction and operating manual was not included with the grinder. The manual that comes with the grinder is not an operating manual but just a general manual that is about useless. I went on line to ""Instruction Manual- Oregon"" and printed a PDF assembly and operating manual that is most helpful and very detailed. I do not know why Oregon did not include this manual with the sharpener."
5,Very Good,"If you have the space for it, not that it's overly large, this is a fine whistle. Plenty loud, sturdy, light weight and visible.Along with a flashlight, a knife and a weapon, this is an everyday carry item for me. I keep it on a key-chain.My dog had been hurt while on a walk and my wife had gotten word back to me that she was at a certain location yet when I went there I couldn't find her. I wound up having to holler for her and it still took quite a while before I found her. A whistle would have been handy and, unlike a phone, there are no batteries that can go dead.# Whistles Meaning1 Where are you?2 Come to me!3 Emergency!"
5,"""Glow"" glows in the dark","Although the Mini, at up to 115 db, isn't as loud as the Micro/Rescue Howler, at up to 122 db, nor as compact to carry, it is easier to blow.What I especially like about the Mini is that ""Glow"" is luminous."
4,"Good whistle, high in pitch","I use this everyday in all weather conditions. Definitely gets the job done. I got the red, which is easy to find in my bag. The mini whistle definately has a higher pitch, which I don't like quite as much as the normal Fox 40. I don't regret the purchase though"
3,I'd like it more if it were louder,"It's an ""okay"" whistle. I like the cushioning, but it's not as loud as I would have liked.It's probably okay for a kid's sport coach. I use mine as an emergency whistle as I walk around DC, but will likely replace it with something louder.I do love the purple color!"
5,great whistle,I use my fox40 mini when I am working with my dog. He responds very well to it. It's the only whistle that I choose to use.
1,Kicks after 1 GB,"I bought two of these 4 GB drives from different vendors and about a year apart, yet I have had the same problem with both of them. At just over 1 gig of photos it starts giving me 'corrupt image' notices, and I have gotten to where I can tell when it's going to happen, because when it does, the camera's display stays on too long after I have taken a shot and then all of my manual settings are reset. I am trying to find research on why it does this, because the reason I bought 4 gigs was so that I did not have to worry about backups while traveling. Now I have to take my laptop or a secondary backup device with me on long trips, which can be cumbersome when travelling internationally, because when these errors begin to happen I have to backup the drive immediately and re-format the card or I can't even continue taking photographs. I have a Canon Eos that's only 3 years old, so the camera should not be the problem."
2,Card crashed after less than a year.,"If I had written this review two weeks ago I would be leaving five stars.I've had this card for less than a year, and use it with my Nikon D70s. I always take great care when handling it, never pressing on the front and back, dropping, or severely jostling it.I took a few photos and went directly inside to transfer them to my computer, but when the drive mounted everything was garbled and all of my data was gone. I popped it back in my camera to confirm the loss of my photos, and the error read ""Card Not Formatted."" I then attempted to format the card via my camera, but it would not format. When trying to format it from a computer it just crashed the entire system (multiple machines.) The card is now utterly useless!I had read of this happening but assumed it was user negligence in some way and bought it anyway. Don't take a chance! Stick with a non-moving CF card instead."
2,There goes my last set of pictures.....,"Used it with my Rebel XT for several days while moving into our new house. Verified that both my Macbook Pro and my PC would read the card (they both did). Took about 700+ pictures, transfered the card to a Lexar Firewire CF Card reader and...wait...where did all my data go? The drive blew its partition out. The Rebel wouldn't even write to it anymore.Had to use a data extraction utility called Drive Scavenger to get my photos back, about half of photos were recoverable, the rest are suffering from green splotches or are gone forever. Maybe I got a bum card, but I do live at high altitude (6600ft).I'm pretty wary now of the whole ""tiny CF hard drive"" thing. I'll leave that to my iPod. Instead, I returned the 4Gb Hitachi CF Card, I purchased two 2GB Lexar cards."
3,Slow in read and write speeds but good card,"I have this Microdrive for over a year now with no problems with it. I just would not buy another one because of the slow speed. I own a D300 and it takes 8sec to write 1 TIFF file to the card, but with SanDisk Extreme III it takes 1sec... I have used it many times when my other cards are full and it has not let me down when storing the images. 1 or 2 time if messed up 1 photo but was quickly noticed and erased and retaken with no problems. I do take care of it and do not subject it to freezing cold or dropping it on the ground. Again I have heard good and bad about this card but I say it is Good."
5,Great text and pictures.,"At first I was sceptic towards this book. Most books on the subject of Death and Afterlife fail to keep an objective point of view and are coloured by the author's religious beliefs. However, this book pleasantly surprised me. It starts with a discussion around the definition of death and then goes through all forms of Death (violent, suicide, euthanasia etc) to what lies beyond. I enjoyed that book, although I think that some people may find some photos disturbing. But, in the long run, Death was never meant to be a pleasant subject."
4,cute game!,"I bought this game for two of my children, ages 7 and 9, but my 14 year old daughter enjoyed it also! It's very cute and they played it until they finished it. They enjoyed picking out which breed of dog they will be in the game and they enjoyed completing all the tasks that they were required to accomplish within the game. It was a lot of fun for them. I'd recommend The Dog Island."
3,Certainly not for young kids; 8 or older might like it!,"In this game, you play a really cute dog (choose from a range of different breeds) and your objeactive is to go on a quest to obtain cure for your dying (yes! not good for young kids) sibling. You come across some scary adventures on the way and you can pass out. Some kids (e.g. 5 yr olds) get really scared of their cute puppy getting passed out / dying. The dogs in the game are very very cute though!I wondered whoever developed this game had no sense of kid psyche. How in the world did this game get an 'E' rating? It should have been 10+ in my opinion."
1,Some disappointed kiddies!!,"My girls (8 and 6) are the ultimate dog lovers! When they saw that we'd bought this game they begged me to let them play it. They loved Nintendogs and played that game for months, so to see something similar on the big screen was very exciting for them. I read previous comments about all the reading that was required for the game, but didn't worry because my girls love to read. They literally played this game for 20 minutes before asking for the other game we bought. There was really no sound except some pleasant elevator music and there was a lot of conversation between the dogs, but it ALL had to be read! There was constant, and I mean CONSTANT, reading. My 8 year old, who reads for about 3 hours a night before going to sleep, was bored. Extremely disappointed, but this game is going back."
1,Worst Game Ever!,"My daughter loves the adventure action and the story. However, the creators did not include any type of easy ""save game"" feature. Whenever you want to save the game, it might take up to 5, 10, 15 minutes or longer. If you can't find it, you lose your progress. Let the tears begin..."
1,a real dog,Bought this game for my granddaughter. Wow was it boring! It took exactly 3 minutes for her to ask to play the bowling game. Don't waste your time with The DOG Island.
1,Not what I expected from this seasoned pro at all!,"I was looking forward to reading Ms. Ross' OUT OF THE MIST. Especially after being disappointed by her last few efforts. I am so disappointed I can't begiin to tell you how upset I am becoming with this writer. I don't know what's happened to Ms. Ross but her last few books (including this one), has left a lot to be desired. Maybe it's time for me to move on to someone new to provide me with a decent story. Perhaps, I'll go back to Linda Howard or Linda Foster. I got the same way with books of JD Robb/Nora Roberts for a while. That was the reason I began reading Ms. Ross' books to begin with. Maybe I should find someone new altogether. Who knows. What I do know however is that I have had it with this writer."
1,A big time dissapointment,"I bought this because well...I read ""Out of the Blue"" the second book in this series and I thought it was good, so I went ahead and bought the first one to the series. And it turned out to be a big dissapointment. The story is boring. She overdone it with the historical facts. The characters are unreal. When someone is telling you that they accuse you of stealing their family heirloom and they're wanting it back. I expected the character to be hurt. But the most unreasonable thing ever! THey have sex! This is a HUGE disgrace toward Ross's name. If you like her writing as I do, please don't buy this installment and go right to the next two. They are much better."
2,Not quite as bad as...,Not quite as bad as 'JR's' last book but still boring and old news. What happened to the 'JR' that I once new? I will give this writer one final time to get it right after that I'm finished with her! Very disappointed!
2,Major Bummer !!,No more ROSS books for me! The plots are becoming so repeative and boring. Chow Baby!
1,From bad to worse !,"I don't know, maybe it's me, but this writer seems to keep going from bad to worse with her stories. No doubt, it's time to change up! Back to the drawing board. With some of the standard writers of this genre lately it is almost as though I have to close my eyes, give it the ennie, meanie, miney, mo teck to see what to read next. (By the way that teck is not working!)"
5,excellent,"Gloria Fraser Giffords does an excellent job in researching an often ignored corner of art history, Mexican folk art. She provides insight into how these images were made, but also helps the reader understand the devotional context in which these images were used by people in the nineteenth century (and are still used by people today). A must for a student in this area, especially as there is not yet abundant information in this field. The images are compelling and beautifully reproduced and the book is easy and interesting to read. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
3,rather academic,"I was seeking a book with great images of retablos. This booknot for the person (me) seeking images, because the ones in this bookare small and not of high quality; this is the reason for my rating."
5,Great taste!,Good price and great taste! Comfort size and package. Five great shapes and 3 yummy flavors! My daughter love it!
1,grex 5/8 staples,I am used to using Senco staples but I thought I would give Grex a try since Amazon does not sell Senco staples in the same size. The Grex staples are made of much softer metal and they will bend even when shot in soft woods.
4,"Good, but difficult. Not for the faint of heart.","There are many, many great things to do with this set. It is difficult for my son to work his way through, and is much better if I read the experiment first, then explain it to him as to what the goal is, and all the steps and ingredients. It's more like a teacher's manual. That said, I believe we will learn a LOT about chemistry!"
4,"Looking for REAL Birth Control? Substitute for ""The Pill""","This Book is great! And it works (When you follow the instuctions)!! My husband and I have been married for almost 2 years and we haven't gotten pregnant, but we have sex alot! It's nice to understand your body's schedule."
4,Well worth it!,"The ovulation book was great. The book was a good price, it was packed full of information and came with a chart and pleanty of stickers to get you and your spouse started on the wonderful journey of natural family planning."
2,Could be Better,"I was hoping that the book went into better detail. It did not help me. However, it was informative and an easy read."
2,Not the best book on natural family planning,"This book is targeted towards Catholics and is based on research from the 1950's. It does not include the basal temperature method, one of the most important methods for tracking fertility patterns. Unless you are Catholic, I recommend getting another book on this topic, such as ""Taking Charge of Your Fertility"" by Toni Weschler."
1,a complete disaster,"To start the company sent me the wrong costume, I had to return it and wait for the right one, again the second time they sent me a similar one but not the one I asked for. They sent me a costume that has a pump that gives (fake) blood to the chest, instead the one I asked gave blood to the head. It was too late to return it again.After that my son wore it and the pump pierced so there was red food coloring everywhere, in his clothes, hands.I do not recommend to buy costumes from that store. Sorry."
1,Leaked everywhere!,"A soon as our son headed out to trick or treat, the costume started leaking. He wasn't playing rough or running around, just walking from house to house. I read the other comments, but he wanted this costume SO bad...I bought it anyway hoping it wouldn't leak as other mentioned. Well, it leaked EVERYWHERE."
3,DMMM... when girls are around,"Just pretend you're playing Oblivion, but just the main quest. I only went through as the wizard, but I got the idea. I never got a stealth kill, I never sniped a dude with an arrow, and I never took on five guys in hand to hand combat, but by the time I was done with the game... I was done. If any of those things that I missed out on sound cool to you, Pick your warrior accordingly. Otherwise be the wiz. He's soft at first, but about an hour in, his magic rocks. The game has stuff hidden everywhere, and that alone kept me looking till world seven... then I sped through the rest. I paid about ten bucks after shipping, and I would say it was worth it. Don't pay any more unless you a hardcore into these games (might and magic). But I'll warn anyone who's not. Oblivion is better in almost every way. Fighting is flashier in DMMM, but the weapons are fewer and almost all the same. That sums up every aspect of the game. Fun for a little while."
4,"Fun Game, Give it a Try","This game got fairly poor reviews but I decided to give it a shot. I was looking for something to occupy my time after Bioshock. The game has some really nice graphics and fun gameplay. It's no Bioshock but I didn't think it was nearly as ""poor"" as the reviews. It's not a great RPG but I am having fun with it and think it's worth playing. Is some of the voice acting cheesy? Yes, but it's not bothersome and seems to fit the genre well. I am not good player and this game generally lets you poke around slowly with a few spots where the actions gets intense. I like it and give 4 of 5 for fun factor"
1,Not a RPG,"This is not a true RPG game. It is a scripted Adventure game with scripted leveling up. If my expectations were set properly, I would give it a higher rating.As an adventure game, it is fun. Most of the monsters are slow moving, so you can take your time to knock them out.Every level has a goal, if you fail, you start over from the beginning, just like ""Grand Theft Auto"" missions."
2,sucks,"Well first things first this is the same game as for the pc, but they donw graded so much its terrible, you cant kck people down stair cases, and that was the best part of the game, kicking people down stair cases lol"
3,Unusually rigid but a decent Theif spinoff,"Dark Messiah of Might and Magic Elements is surprisingly rigid, particularly in the level design. It was advertised as sort of a sandbox game where you explore dungeons and set off traps and shoot ice spells at the floor to make enemies slide off ledges. Yeah that's all there, but the game is absolutely nothing but encapsulated rooms/hallways where it is obvious over and over that you can crush the entire room of enemies by setting off an obviously placed trap. However, the combat is so easy, even on hard, that often it isn't worth bothering trying to be clever.The redeeming features to this game are the rope bow for climbing, the hidden treasures and equipment that you can spend hours finding, creepy spiders, and kicking unsuspecting people or orcs off of cliffs. The value increases if you particularly love the Thief series. Recommended on PC over console."
3,Good for the Aquabats Fan,"""Myths"" is a good Aquabats album, don't get me wrong, but only for those already initiated to their superhero/high school themed antics. More specifically, those initiated into their ""new"" sound, found on the album ""The Aquabats vs. the Floating Eye of Death"". ""Myths"" is essentially outtakes and rare compilation only tracks recorded around the time ""Floating Eye"" was recorded, so it has the same ""feel"".As for the band and music itself, the Aquabats have reached a new plateau in their abilities, shedding most of their ""3rd Wave Ska"" styles, and replacing them with a more Devo-ish sound.All in all, ""Myths"" is a good album, but not for those unfamliar with the band."
4,Aquabats,this cd is awesome. its not ska as i was expecting. its third wave. but as far as third wave goes this is an awesomely awesome band. they are so cool. i saw them live in lawrence and they were absolutely crazy. i love their stuff and look forward to getting their other cd's.
1,What The @#$@ Is THIS,"I'm probably going to get flamed by every devotee of this ""band"", but I have to express MY opinion about this ""music"". This has to be some of the worst sounds I've heard in my entire life. This ""group"" is just pure crap, what can I say. These guys might have talent, but why waste it making this garbage? To set the record straight, I didnt just look up some obscure band I've never heard of to trash. I discovered this ""music"" through a friend. Maybe I dont like it because Im just not fan and I dont ""understand"".Oh, and dont tell me this music is about having ""fun"", because I love to have fun, but not ""fun"" for 2 yr olds."
2,Ben gay cream,"i found this painj relieving item to be effective, however was unable to apply if I had to leave my home unexpectedly because of strong odor."
5,"Effective, Temporary Itch Relief Too","A product that is 4% Camphor, 10% Menthol and 30% Methyl Salicylate produces a burning/cooling sensation that also relieves itches. It doesn't treat the itch, of course, but if you need immediate relief that will last about an hour or so, this product can help."
2,Completely Transparent,"These blinds are nothing like the ones shown in the picture. They are nice as a decorative touch, but do absolutely nothing in terms of providing privacy. There is a lot of space between the strands of bamboo and you can see right through it."
5,Love these blinds,"I am concerned about others who love bamboo and the lighting effects it has on a room, to be diminished because of a previous reviewer. These blinds are not expected to provide privacy. They are warmth, beauty, and comfort to a room. These are an exceptional value; color, quality."
2,This Book is a Mess,"I very much enjoy Ira Levin's work. Do not read this book, though, if you expect his usual performance. This book is a mess. It's nowhere near as good as ROSEMARY'S BABY although it tries to be. If you must read it to find out ""what happened,"" as I did, you'll find that what happened is that Ira Levin went a bit nutso. Don't say I didn't warn you."
2,Cliche much?,"Sad to say, but what a disappointment! I could not believe what the author pulled on the last few pages."
3,Twist and turns,"I really liked the story, the build up. The twist and turns but not to crazy on the leaving hanging ending. But it didn't leave you hanging. I guess that I didn't care for the ending."
2,Son of Rosemary is not good.,"I was very excited to read the sequel to Rosemary's Baby as it is one of my favorites. Unfortunately, I was seriously disappointed. Son of Rosemary is bad. It's dull, at times confusing and kind of gross. Andy makes romantic passes at Rosemary and all Rosemary says its 'oh, my angel' or 'darling'. She never really discourages him. Uhm...ick. Nothing really happens until the last few pages of the book.I almost wish I didn't read it in the way I wish I never watched The Godfather, Part 3.It's that awful."
2,Not quite what I wanted.,"The picture of this lamp looked great. However, when we received it , it was quite flimsy. It was hard to stabilize the base. Very disappointing."
1,What?,"Okay, first of all, I like seahorses. And I wan't to learn more about them, but this toy seahorse is not of much use to a thirteen-year-old hopeful writer.... Zachary B., 7th grade"
2,Great beginning but falls flat after that,"I found this book at my local library and it caught my eye. I started on it and I was completely engrossed for about halfway through it, but then it fell completely apart. It seemed like the writer just ran out of ideas which is sad because this could have been a 5 star book.The concept is original and the story starts off fast, but after about page 150 it just gets very boring. The ending is completely dumb and every character is cold and shallow to a point were you really don't care who lives or dies.I still have to give it 2 stars though because the concept was cool and the beginning was great."
4,Very good basic reference,I just received the book a few days ago. I was quite surprised. This is the biggest book I've seen. Covers a lot of detail. No prior knowledge required.
1,Numerous mistakes throughout text,"When using this text, I found many mistakes in the text, especially the figures. If you are interested in Chapter 14, beware. There are several errors in the explanation of second-order responses."
2,Too generic!,"I bought this book looking for information on how to best use our controllers here at the plant, and this book just didn't help me out much at all. I wouldn't trust all of those good reviews if you're looking for specific information."
1,Not too helpful,"I spent the last two weeks looking at this book trying to figure out just what it's going to teach me. Unfortunately, the material covered in this book isn't for someone who already knows something about PLCs. I bought this book thinking that it would be handy as a reference guide, for the little things I forget sometimes. But this book is so basic. It's defintely a beginners book"
4,beautifully done applique and fun simple verses,The applique in this book is wonderful! My 2-year-old really liked the simple verses and pretty pictures.
1,no comply,i never recieved it to my knowledge i canceled the order ? can you please let me know if this is the case.
2,What was this designed for?,"If you use this in a standard wall double outlet, then this should be rotated 90% otherwise one plug is useless because it conflicts with th other wall outlet. This is only good for a one socket system, or a cord with sockets side by side, not vertical"
2,Meh...,"Immolation are a highly overrated Death Metal band. Sure, Death Metal really does appeal to me but this one doesn't seem to spark my interest.This album is ALL about anti-religion. Actually, I found out that all of their albums are about anti-religion. They just can't find any consistency in the songwriting department. I dig most lyrical themes about Death, Gore, Science, and some stuff like that but this one keeps plodding along song after song persistently crying out hatred towards religion. Immolation is also a second-rate clone to Suffocation, an even better Death Metal band that helped define what technicality in Death Metal is all about.I say pass this band. Immolation are overrated and inconsistent as hell. And to that junkhead guy, first of all, Immolation are not from Florida. They hail from New York. Second, you hate Floridian Death Metal? You, sir, have no taste in music whatsoever.39/100"
2,so fu**in empty,look i like some death metal but most of it is devoid of emotion.anyone witha twisted mind and a good imagination can write and singdeath metal. but a lot of it seems so empty to me. it doesnt convince me these guys actually have emotions im not talkin about love or anything but these guys dont hate everything like the pretend they do. if u want death metal with some feeling that will actually inspire emotion when you listen to it try some sweedish death metal or any black metal. that stuff actually sends shivers down your spine. dissection rule f**k this florida death metal s*it
2,Great while it worked,"This machine worked for just about 14 months before the volume adjustment wouldn't work. It's now stuck at such a quiet setting that it is useless. Until then, it was great. I did contact the company, but I'm not expecting much since it is just out of warranty. I did have a different Marpac machine (Dohm - 2 speed) that broke within the first four months and the company replaced it. The replacement has been working well for over a year."
5,a gift,My wife loves this unit. Her sleep is easily disturbed. This unit offers several different sounds to mask outside noise.
4,Easy to use,"The Marsona DS-600A Sound Conditioner has served us well thus far. For our medical office, it provides the white noise for privacy. It is easy to use and has GREAT volume control. Lightweight and simple in design. We've got 2 in our office and are happy with them. A little pricy but the battery option was vital for our needs."
5,Love it!!! couldn't sleep without it!,"i've had this for over a year now and love it! i also own the regular sound screen/sleep mates by marpac (4 of them-one for each bedroom) but bought this for the babies room b.c. i needed a louder version. this works great! it will even mask out the fire egine sirens that blast down our street. (we live next to a fire station)when we travel i only take this one b.c. it works the best and you can control the volume. the other traditional sleep mates are fine too, but am glad they made this. well worth the money."
5,Saved my life!,"I am 50 years old and have never submitted a review for any product in the past. I have used TV static to sleep for the last 20+ years and loved it because it could be turned up as loud as I needed it. The last TV we had with audible sound just completely died and I couldn't sleep. I purchased a Dohm round sound machine, and it worked somewhat, but wasn't loud enough to block out all sounds. This machine is WONDERFUL & VERY LOUD!!!! It's loud with the volume turned all the way up. If you prefer less sound, the lower volume levels approximate the Dohm machine. I can finally sleep like I did before the TV broke!! It literally saved my life giving me my typical sleep back!"
2,missing part,should come with two electric cables -for 110v/and for 220vthe 220v cable is missing which means it can't be used/
1,Broke after one hour of use,"What a piece of junk. My gf bought this 2 years ago and did not use it (she has another one) and let me use it. I turned it on and liked the sounds and looked forward to a good night's sleep, due to my somewhat loud neighbors. Unfortunately, after an hour of use, I shut the machine off, and then tried to turn it back on at night, and it didn't work. I tried everything--batteries only, different outlets, I even took it apart and looked inside. How cheaply made it was! I was about to discard it, but the next day I plugged it in and it worked. I then tried again to use it to go to sleep, and the machine wouldn't turn on. Made in USA it says. Any warranty it had expired. I will never buy a Marpac product."
4,Does help sleep around noise,"This product is certainly very helpful in creating an atmosphere to wipe out disturbing outside noises, like whizzing traffic, which interfere with sleep. Of the sounds offered, we have found the ""surf"" sound the most conducive to sleep. However, we wish the quality of the sound was a little better and less like the ""tin-can"" variety, which is the only fault we would note. However, given the machine is so small, it is to be expected that sound quality will be somewhat compromised. The good news is that it certainly works in helping white out other noises."
1,USELSS! Broke almost instantly!,"This machine briefly worked for me (month or two) and then the volume switch broke! It is a slide switch, and it either comes on top volume (way too loud) or barely at all (way too quiet - as in there's no point in turning it on it's so quiet). I cannot adjust it, even when sliding the volume switch as gently as possible.The sounds are just okay - not worth the money for the sound quality.The machine in general (even if the volume worked) is NOT worth the money. I have two other Marpac sound machines, both different models than this one, and like them. Then again, they were much cheaper models....and then again they did not break!"
4,If It Is Too Quiet...,"I am very happy with my new DS-600 sound machine. I recently moved to a new neighborhood. It is a very quiet neighborhood. Too quiet. I found it difficult to sleep with all that silence going on around me. So, I did a little checking on-line and decided to give this product a try.Now, I find that I have just enough ""noise"" to get to sleep. I prefer the surf sound. The rain is also good. The waterfall sound is a little too monotone for my tastes and I am not all that excited over the crickets and frogs. But, overall I am sleeping better with the sound machine.The machine itself is very easy to operate and produces good, but not great, sound. The sounds are not quite true to life, but they serve their purpose.If it is just a little too quiet for you and you need a little noise to get some sleep, I would recommend this machine."
5,Marsona Sleep Machine,This is one of the best products of its kind I've ever used. The sounds are much more realistic than other brands I've tried. They really sound like what they're supposed to. I give this an A+ I highly recommend it to those who need sleep machines.
1,Loved it while it (briefly) worked,"I bought this product for my niece who just purchased a condo unit with thin walls. I was familiar with the older (basic) versions of Marpac white-noise machines and thought I would give the ""new and improved"" digital version as a gift. The 6 options of soothing sounds were VERY nice, so I ordered it at a hefty price, I might add, for my sleep-challenged niece's pleasure. She LOVED it until after approximately 4 weeks (!) of use the unit starting making annoying clicking noises instead of soothing environmental sounds. She is in the process of repacking the unit and sending it back to the manufacturer for replacement/reconditioning. Sometimes fancier (digital in this case) is not necessarily better."
1,Makes clicking sound,"I have owned several Marpac/Marsona sound machines during the years. They have all been great except for this one. It makes a clicking sound every few seconds, so I am unable to sleep. I lie awake waiting for the next clicking sound."
2,Not for longer wear,"They worked fine for short term. Wore them to an IPSC match and after a couple hours the band started hurting the sides of my ear . The shaft from the band to the plug should be longer so the band does not impact the outer part of your ear. I am going to switch to the Howard Leight Earbands, where have the longer shaft and keep the band off of your ear."
2,Too painful for long time use,"The plastic band cannot be adjusted, and the pressure forces the ear plugs deep into your ear canal. I can only wear these for about 30 minutes then I have to pull them out, and I can only wear them for about an hour a day. They do seal tightly and block noise.I got these for yard mowing because my outside-the-ear ""earmuff"" hearing protectors became hot and wet with sweat. I have an older pair of ear plug protectors that have an adjustable stainless steel band and a blunt type of oil filled ear plug, and they are more comfortable. It would help if a blunt type of ear plug was offered.These would be good for short time noise exposure. The most comfortable hearing protection I have found are the cheap foam ear plugs that you compress by rolling between your fingers and then press into your ear canal."
2,Hurts my ears after 10 minutes,These plugs do reduce the noise from shooting but I can't stand the pain after ten minutes.
1,"Way too tight, in pain after about 5 minutes!","These just plain hurt my ears. If I could endure the pain they might loosen up, or maybe pulling them apart to stretch them out might help. I gave up and went back to regular plugs and I am shopping for some of those cool over the ear filtering ear protectors....."
4,Good for the price,I got these for when I'm on my motorcycle to cut down highway noise.they cut the noise down by about 60%. They fit fine and I wear them for hours at a time. I also shot my .357 and 9mm while wearing these and they did fine.crazy as it seems I think they are better for shooting than riding.
1,the secret garden,I received the wrong VHS tape. I specifically requested the movie starring Margaret O'Brien. The one I got were actors I never heard of. Also the tape arrived needing to be rewound. This was to be a present for my 83 year old mother therefore not only was I disappointed by she was as well.I no longer have the receipt for this purchase. The only record of me having purchased it is the Amazon records. Do you have any advice as to how I can return this item for a refund?
2,"Highly campy and hysterical, but rather good.","The 1949 film version of ""The Secret Garden"" has its good points and its bad points. The good is that it's well-made by MGM, and its shifts from black-and-white to color are awesome. Now, the bad. Actually, it's not bad, just a few words of friendly warning. The child actors in this film seem to ham up their roles so much that the viewer starts to either gag or laugh with derision. Margaret O'Brien [Mary Lennox] is the most obvious example, with Dean Stockwell [Colin Craven] following her path. Their tantrum scenes are hysterical beyond comprehension! Also, the word ""hate"" is used to the nth degree, so much so that it becomes extremely laughable. No other movie I've seen uses this word so much. You could almost see this film as a part of MST3K, where you can have or make fun of it, but in a good way."
5,BEAUTIFUL CLASSIC FOR ALL AGES !!!,"This is a PERFECT movie for movie lovers of ALL AGES......Beautifuly told story......Margaret O'Brien the brilliant childactress from the 1940's is EXCELLENT in the role of 'Mary'....Also SUPERB in the roles of 'Colin' & 'Dicken' are Dean Stockwell and Brian Roper....Since having read the book as a kid, and viewing theBBC and last remake, In my opinion: THIS version is still THEBEST !!!!Beautiful Color for 1949 which is enchanting as it switchesback and forth from color to black and white......They just DON'T make movies like this no more.......This movie must DEFINITLY BE ON DVD !!!!And i agree with other reviewers on ""NOT"" (Re-mastering it) !!!Just put on DVD with some old vintage EXTRAS !!!It's a RARE find on VHS and Expensive.....If you don't mind forking out some extra bucks it's worth owning a copy.....NEW & USED copies can be found here from time to time...ALSO ONEBAY !!! If not you can occasionaly catch it on AMC or TCM...."
2,"Not an Interview, Just a Recap","This interview is nothing more than a recap of the book. Marcus Buckingham's answers to the questions often use the very same wording as the book. Further, this interview isn't even useful as a judge of the book's contents. Though it recaps the same stuff, you really must read the book to understand his points. I think that if I had just read this interview, I would leave saying ""well that doesn't seem particularly insightful"" and probably wouldn't read the book. In other words, save yourself the 6 bucks."
1,Is not Recommended,I bouth two times and lamps dide after few mounts. The out put was so low that I was not sur my head light is on. I will not buy it and I don't recommend this product at all.
2,Good light very short life.,I love these light bulbs . Too bad one burned out in less than one month..Now I have to buy two new one to be a match.
2,Not worth it.,"Bulb isn't worth it. It's actually dimmer than the original 55w bulb that it replaced. However, it is white, almost as factory HID."
4,Affordable bright lights!,"for the cost of a sylvania at the auto parts store, you get two of these. Bright and almost white light! love them!"
3,Thought they would be brighter,I had 55 watts installed and thought that 100 watts would be much brighter than mine. They're about the same thing. Expected more.
1,Blown globes,Was very disappointed as first globe blew out after 2 weeks. Took out the good one to see how it was fairing and it had a large bulge on the glass and was obviously about to burst. Obviously got too hot.
4,Dinosaur Train,My daughter loves dinosaur train and so she loves this movie. Would recommend for any child fan of the show.
5,Prepare To Be Impressed,"I actually received this book free and, as a result, had very low expectations. Well, cliches are not always true... The artwork is stunning and the whole presentation captures you from the minute you open the cover. The text appears to be very accurate and follows closely with my NIV. I would recommend this as a gift for anyone you know who is resistant to reading the Bible for the first time. (This definitely includes adults.) I intend to read it cover to cover--something I haven't ever done with my full text Bible. Very impressive."
4,A beautiful work from graphic novel artist Jeff Anderson,"Jeff Anderson may be best known for his work on Judge Dredd but his work on ""The Graphic Bible"" is an important step in the globalization of graphic novels. Anderson with Mike Maddox and Steve Harrison has moved the stories of the Bible from history to the full glory of myth. Myth in the fullest definition of the word - telling the deepest truths of humanity.Some under-teens may like this book but I would not call it a children's book. It is more likely to appeal to fans of graphic novels who are used to following stories set out in this manner."
3,Great Illustrations But Not Completely Accurate,"Although this is a beautiful presentation of familiar stories, it is not completely faithful in its re-telling of the scriptures."
5,great,I ordered this because we had a net but it was flimsy this one is stronger and made with thicker plastic and it also helped remove smaller debri along with the larger debri
5,What a treat!,Always lovely watching these parodies. Fabulous photography and a glimpse into a world that sort-of was. We've been watching the entire series from front to back while we sometimes dress up a bit and watch from my computer while at dinner. Great fun!!
3,could of been much better,"in all honesty, you are better off buying ""mellisa"" and ""don't break the oath"" as seprate albums then buying this because there are alot of MF songs that they left out that i feel are some of the bands best songs like ""at the sound of the deamon bell"" ""nightmare"" ""night of the unborn"" ect. i also feel that you have to listen to a whole album in its entirty to fully experinec the songs on them, i really don't like best of albums, but this gets 3 stars anyway because its mercyful fate."
2,Metallica does MF better than they do themselves,Just listen to the Mercyful Fate medley on the Garage Inc. album. It's better than these original versions.
4,Great Product!,I have been using Dermalogica for a long time. Great overall product. Keeps your face moisturized. all the products are worth the money!
4,Heavy cream - good for winter,"This cream is a good face cream for winter or the fall to winter transition. I wouldn't recommend it for oily skin. But if you travel or live in a dry climate, it's pretty great."
4,Ok,"A little greasy for my liking, but it does work well. I do prefer the Active Moist though, less greasy. No smell, if that is what you like."
4,Very gentle and good for your skin,"This product is a little expencive, but I like quality of this moisturizer. I will purchase again, but look other places on Internet for a little better deals, even thought I love Amazon."
2,validity,My box did not have the derma seal sticker which makes me very uncomfortable in the validity of this item...
3,Not the best!,"My skin has changed over the years to a dry, sensitive condition and I tho't a more expensive moisturizer would solve the issue. This product does not and it also clogs the pores."
4,Excellent Moisturerizer,There are very few moisturizing products available for men. I chose this product because I have been unable to find anything that would work effectively on my chronic dry skin. This product provides twenty-four hour moisture for the face and maintains the facial moisture all day without heaviness or excess shine.
1,poor quality,"Its size and type was what I want, but it was broken after being used only several days. I returned it."

3,I am dreaming of another dimension...,"...where something less mundane happens. Don't get me wrong... great setup in book one, characters, possible plot, etc., but I found this story a bit boring.I find it difficult to relate to a 14 year that thinks like an adult; a super-mom who is a bit unbelieveable; and I could care less about a teenage witch using her powers to woo a potential boyfriend (I can get the drivel from the tube).That said, the back drop is interesting and the underlying plot has potential... worth a read if you have got anything else around... Personally I would go with George Martin, Donaldson, Orson Scott Card, J.V. Jones, Fiest (some), etc."
5,Great Christmas CD!,"Andy Griffith not only sings songs on this CD, but tells a few stories, all with a Christmas theme. The stories are told in a very engaging, expressive way, even though Andy doesn't sound exactly the same as he did in the late 50s and 60s telling his country stories, but that's to be expected. This CD is very well put together, with a nice booklet and pictures. He sings all selections on this album very well, very similar to the ""I Love to Tell the Story"" and ""Just As I Am"" albums a few years before. I also like this CD because it has a Christmas theme, which Andy Griffith hasn't done before."
5,Answer to the Bach Question,"I highly recommend the Bach Cello suites performed by Edgar Meyer. The album is called Bach: Unaccompanied Cello Suites, Nos. 1, 2, and 5, and on it, Edgar Meyer transcribes the Cello pieces for the double bass. It is a stunning achievement (and if you're looking for the sound from You Can Count on Me--I think this is the album for you)."
4,Not Yo-Yo or Rostropovich...,"It's actually Jacqueline du Pre. I obtained copies of all three versions (Yo-Yo, Rostropovich, and du Pre), and du Pre's version was the one that best resembled the rendition of Bach's Cello Suite #1 in the movie. I have not yet heard Edgar Meyer's rendition, so I don't know whether his is perhaps the correct version, but I really do believe the version used in the film is du Pre's. It comes from her album ""Jacqueline du Pre: The Early BBC Recordings"" by EMI Classics - #73377. Hope that helps!"
4,Which Bach cantata by the grave?,"Near the end of the movie, when Terry (the brother) is sitting by his parents' grave stones, there is a short and sudden choral background. I think it's from a Bach cantata. It's a lament emphsizing the word schmerz (pain in German). Can someone tell me what cantata it's from? I want to hear it again. I think it's in one of the dozens of Bach cantata CDs I have, but I'm ashamed to say I don't know which one."
3,Where is the music of composer Lesley Barber?,"All of the songs are fine. But a real bummer was the exclusion of film's music composer, Lesley Barber. Barber's music was very simple but austere and it would've made a nice bookender for this soundtrack."
3,It's not Rostropovich,"I can't find the exact version of 'Suite #1 in G Major' either, everyone plays it much faster than in the movie. I have the 2 cd set of Rostropovich playing the Bach Suites 1-6 (EMI 1995) but it doesn't contain the version that's used in the movie.It's a shame that they don't mention this anywhere that I can find, I'll have to keep digging around in the movie details."
3,"Yes, the cello is missing","The cello piece is the prelude from Bach's Cello Suite No. 1 in G-major. EMI has a great recording of all 6 suites played by Mstislav Rostropovich. He titles the first suite ""Lightness"". It's wonderful."
3,Likely Yo Yo Ma,"The Bach Piece is Suite 1, S 1007 in G major, the prelude -- also likely the same version used in ""Master and Commander"". ""You can count on Me"" is one of my favorite movies. Both Mark Ruffalo and Laura Linney are two of America's best actors. Laura Linney is prettier."
3,"I wish, I wish","The cellist who played the Bach in the movie, is Roman Borys, a top Canadian cellist. His interpretation of the 1st Suite is so gentle and melancholy that I rated this recording down because it isn't included on the CD. What a shame!"
3,incomplete soundtrack,"Apparently the complete soundtrack from the movie is missing several key songs, including 3 vocals by the incomparable Loretta Lynn, and this Bach:""Aus Liebe will Meine Heiland sterben!"" from St. Matthew Passion; Performed by Reinische Kantorei Das Kleine Kozart; Deutsche Grammaphon Gesellschaft GmbH., Hamburg"
4,Great but missing a critical piece...,"The movie is excellent and the music on the soundtrack is a nice complement to a touching and funny story, but where is the beautiful score with the haunting cello?? It is a shame that it was left out."
3,Unfortunately,"Very good looking print design.Unfortunately it is not a button-down collar shirt.With a button-down collar it would be a 5 stars shirt, and I`ll will buy it without hesitation."
4,Adventure in evolution of new relationship in Europe,"How do people come to understand each other in a new relationship and overcome the obstacles that are largely their own creation? One of the two knows something and is trying to help the other go beyond his limitations so they can be together on the terms she is compelled to follow. Their struggle and the beautiful European countryside settings made this an engrossing and rewarding experience for me. I also enjoyed the feel of the ""culture of Europe."" Also, I don't believe I saw anyone shot. or a gun at all."
2,Not as good as Remarque's novel,"A great novel by Erich Maria Remaarque, Heaven Has No Favorites, is badly mistreated here. While the novel is set in much earlier in the 20TH Century, the movie was set in the 70's. The result was the loss some of the post-war dynamic found in the novel. The dying woman/love interest so common in Remarque's work seemed almost psychotic in the flick, and somewhat annoying. The heroine in the novel was nothing like that, much more subtle and sophisticated."
5,return to life!!,"one of the best and misunderstood movie by Sydney PollackIt is not ""just a trivial story about love"" as lot of people said, but a very subtle and original tale about what beeing alive means! The races of Bobby (played by an amazing and uncommon Al Pacino ) are useless until he learns, at least, what Compation is opening his own heart to Beauty, to Love, and to Death too, of course. his breaf and intense encounter with a dying woman (Marthe Keller) is going to be a success by giving birth to a new man who could go back among alive people... A really good movie we could absolutaly ask for a DVD release!"
1,Not worth the money!,I was really disappointed when this item arrived. The concept is great and with improvement could be a wonderful learning tool.It cannot be used by a child just wanting to hear letters or play by ones self. The product is used more like a game.The person sounding out the phonics sounds like a robot and is very hard to understand....definately not teaching phonic sounds.
2,Just get a chalkboard!,"The computer is hard to understand and she is wrong sometimes, which is very frustrating to my five year old. The only use is he can pretend to be a teacher with the games off. The quality is a little bit shabby. i am not sure how long it will hold up."
5,Very cute,This is a very well made toy. My 3 and 5 year old girls love this. Chalk board wipes clean with baby wipe with no sign of previous writing on it. Very pleased .
1,mini frog,"When i received it ,i was suprised it was so small.It didnt last very long.About 2 weeks maybe"
1,"When they say small, they mean tiny to non-existent!","ok, I should have heeded the warnings, but really this has got to be the tiniest dog toy I have ever seen. careful, they could swallow the darn thing. I would not even let our dog play with it, right in the waste bin it went :-) we have purchased lots of other Kong products, particularly the plastic/rubber ones, and they have all been quite nice but for this one."
5,Reordering!,"This little frog is the favorite toy of both my toy poodles. One is always sad when the other one has it, so I am forced to buy another one."
5,Perfect for my teacup,I have a teacup yorkie-poo and he LOVES these toys. He's about 2lbs and has trouble being able to play with most toys. But these toys are great! They fit in his mouth and he can squeak them no problem.I wouldn't recommend this toy for any dog over 5lbs. It is extremely small.
2,Both squeakers destroyed in less than 5 minutes.,"My 4-lb yorkie puppy loved the extra small frog. However, he destroyed the squeaker in less than 5 minutes. He did the same with the extra squeaker. Most of his squeakers in his other toys have survived so perhaps the lack of padding in this one makes it easier to destroy the squeaker. He still plays with the frog sans the squeaker but it's not as exciting for him."
1,"Kong Frog Dog Toy, extra small","OK, I love Kong toys and I did want small BUT this toy was too small for our little Yorkie. It was his favorite toy from his stocking but it was too small. I'm trying to figure out what dog it would be small enough for ... maybe a puppy yorkie."
2,Lasted 20 min,"This toy is extra tiny, my 10 lb dog could swallow it. He had it about 15 min before pulling the Velcro off the back which leaves it wide open with the squeeker sticking out. I had to throw it away less than 20 min after opening it. Waste of money."
5,My teacup poodles LOVE this toy!,"This is the perfect size for very small dogs. I have three teacup poodles and they all try to grab this one and run! The best part is when two of them fight over it, each grabbing it and growling at the other to let go! This toy will bring out the FEROCIOUS in your tiny pup! WOOF! :)"
3,"Ok, but not great.","Our dog really enjoys playing with these, but he's a 13 lb Shih Tzu and isn't too rough of things (before we rescued him, he had a rough life and is missing several teeth). This is very small, even for him, so I wouldn't expect it to work for a dog any larger or one that had all his teeth :D"
3,"perfect size, not durable","This would be the perfect toy as far as size for my chihuahua. However, she is very smart and has it opened from the Velcro and squeaker and stuffing out. I need a tiny toy that does something (squeak, vibrate, contain a treat) that is durable but not rubber. This is too flimsy."
3,"Good, Fun Video -- only covers the basics","All the Standart Deviant videos are fun to watch. They have a Saturday-Night-Live format with different people and skits.The material covered was good, and it is a great intro to those who haven't any trig background.The video series downfall is the material not covered or covered in enough depth: trig identities, vectors, polar and rectangular conversions, imaginary number plane with radical and exponential equations. I found the material not covered to be the toughest concepts in trig. It helps to be ahead of the instructor, but the videos were no help in these tough areas.Some of the other Standard Deviant titles are better done, but this video is still a great intro to the easier 2/3 of the material you will encounter."
4,want some real advice...get the whole math pack,I used to have nightmares about being chased by giant triangles.Not any more! the tapes make the unclear...clear thats bottom line. no they arent perfect and nope not enough problems... but overall if your struggling this is the way to go..period
1,Hated it,"Worst thing ever, threw it away as soon as I opened it.Very small and cheap. Choking hazard even for small dogs"
3,Very tiny!,"I'll admit it, I didn't really read the reviews before purchasing. This is very cute and tiny!! I bought for my 9 pound Chi mix and there is no way I can give to him. He could choke. If you have tiny dog, then this is for you. Super cute, just not for my dog."
5,Love this!,My dog absolutely loves this toy and it's the perfect size for her! She's a 7lb mini doxie.
2,Just Duckie Duck,"The duckie was well made, but it lasted about 5 minutes. No longer than any other squeak toy I have purchased for my dog. So what will I do with the extra squeaker? And it indead was smaller than listed."
1,short lived,i bought this toy for my 6 pound shih tzu puppy because the size was perfect. the sqeakers lasted for only a few hours of play each. disappointing!
1,Good duck but significantly smaller than dimensions in description,"The duck I received was 1.5""x1""x3"", not the 3""x2""x5"" listed in product description. I suspect product description size included the cardboard that duckie was attached to. Four stars for toy quality minus three stars for deceptive advertising - would not have purchased if I knew actual size and not worth the postage to return."
2,Too Small for a dog!,"This toy is so small that it would be dangerous for even the tiniest of dogs. It is not that well-made and is not worth the money. For a safe toy and one that can not be easily swallowed by your pet, I recommend the AKC plush dog toys. This Kong duckie is just too tiny and a dangerous side for most ogs. Do not buy this toy, it is a waste of money. Try something larger and safer, this toy is not worth the risk to your pets."
2,Gone in 60 Seconds....(not just a movie title),"My 12 lb. Cockapoo had this Easter gift shredded in just under a minute. It did seem smaller than portrayed in the description, (as other reviewers have said) and maybe my dog thought this one was possessed or something and HAD to be destroyed. I gave it two stars as opposed to one because she REALLY enjoyed chomping on her Duckie until I picked up all of the pieces of it scattered around my carpet."
5,Fantastic little toy!!,I have a 6 month yorkie and 4 year old husky. I bought a huge elephant toy for my yorkie and he chewed off the leg and that became his favorite toy. A 2 in elephant leg.. lol so i thought i'd look for tiny toys and see if he would like them and sure enough he loves this duck!! Him and the husky fight over it. Its too cute watching my husky run around with this tiny duck toy in her mouth!!I bought the beaver too and he just loves it!! These are great!!
4,Tiny,"My 5lb dog prefers the small size vs the x-small. It is teeny tiny, but he still plays with it."
5,My boy loves Chicken!,Our 5 lbs chihuahua loves this toy. It even went to the vet with him. He has over 40 toys but this is his 'go to' and is played with daily. Holds up well too.
2,Beware of size!,"Teeny tiny toy. My dogs are rat terriers and this toy is smaller than their noses. I an afraid to let them play with it in fear they can swallow it.I knew this would be small, but I underestimated how small, beware before buying.The toy itself is ok but it doesn't seem well made. There were already strings hanging down before they even touched it.It is cute though and looks like the picture."
5,tiny but tough!,My puppy loves this little duckie. He's a one year old mini dachshund and he pretty well tore up all his puppy toys from when he was younger. But some of them endured because they were made sturdy. This is one of them.
3,good for people doing one semester of biology,"this book is great for those people who want to take the first semester of biology. its thinner, more portable, less expensive and much easier to work from in general. it the first 20 chapters of the hardback book and filled with just as much information"
1,Too small !!!,Too small for me. The picture made them seem bigger. Very disappointed. Quality is great. The width is equivalent to a thin slice of bread.
2,Boring,Did not enjoy this book I thought she was trying too hard and there was no flow to it. Just jumped from one subject to the next.
5,back cover,Marth Bolton's take on being middle ages will leave readers laughing out loud and will help you face the day with a smile. this veteran comedy writer adds occasional touching and poignant stories and remind readers what life is all about. . .
2,Great Voice,"What a great voice for a singer, but if I had known there was only one song on the CD -- buy a full CD somewhere else!"
5,ILLUMINATING!,"When President Nixon submitted for our collective approval his resignation speech on that hot August night in 1974, did you know that he actually had TWO Buchanan-penned speeches on his desk? One being the Resignation speech, and the other a ""I Must Fight On!"" speech. Until he began reading, absolutely no one, perhaps not even the President, knew which one he was going to read! Now that's a mercurial man! This chronicle is full of odd tid-bits that were unknown by the public at the time. I still think Rosemary Woods was Deep Throat. Who else would have unfettered access to his desk (where he kept his ""Enemies List""?). Well?"
4,A great read for those wanting to understand a bit better...,"This book is amazingly detailed, and after the first 100 pages or so becomes an enjoyable read. The earlier sections are pretty hard to get through, feeling very disjointed and unconnected (perhaps it was easier to read 25 years ago!). I doubt understanding Nixon is really possible, but this book gives detailed insight into what likely was going on during his last days as president."
5,The final days of the Nixon adminstration,Although I am still reading this I am enjoying it immensely. It is very well written and brings me back to a very terrible and embarrassing part of our past. I had read All the President's Men when first released and wish that I still had a copy handy to read it again.I have to keep reminding myself that this is NOT a novel. It is full of intrigue and disception. One wonders how our country survived the reign of Richard Milhouse Nixon
1,Are you kidding me??,"Look, as a recent graduated History Major, I obviously have no real full time job. As a pet project, suggested to me by one of my professors, I have researched and re-read most, if not all of the Nixon era material. At first read, this is a gripping account, almost impossible to put down. Only later, when I went back and looked a little deeper, did I discover just what gross exagerations and outright falsehoods this account holds. There is not the room here, but time after time I have found cited sources that have said, on the record, that they were either mis-quoted or flat out rewritten. Entire episodes that are supposedly 'first hand' experiences turn out in some cases to be nothing more that 3rd hand falsehoods. Re-read in this light, the book takes on the color and feel of a smear job."
1,Disturbed Authors,"Woodward and Bernstein are out of touch with reality. Their obvious bias is reflected to the point of absurdity.There is more accuracy in Japanese re-writes of history than in ""Final Days"". It's unfortunate journalists like these 2 have been given so much press."
5,Review of Flywheel & Facing the Giants.,"Both were surprisingly entertaining films, especially Flywheel considering it was the first of these - made with a minimal budget.If you like inspiring stories of success out of integrity and love, these are well worth watching. They're tear jerkers sometimes, yet funny also.2 thumbs up!!"
4,Very pleased.,I was very pleased with these products and the purchase price from Amazon. These movies were very uplifting and they really help you put life and all it's challenges into perspective.
5,Very Happy to have this book in my hands,I was looking for the best dreams books in the world and I got this. I am so happy to have this.
4,Pfft,"Alright, I bought the game expecting it to be better then it actually was. I'm satisfied for buying it at the price I did (Being under 10 bucks) and feel I would've paid a little bit more if this was on the shelf at my local game store.Game isn't hard to pick up, so it's worth the buy."
2,U get what you paid for!,"I got this game based on the price of $9.99. This game is really bad, I like Anime but this game lacks everything in the Xbox 360 Dept. Bad gameplay, music, and graphics. This title will work well for kids 5 yrs old and younger. Buyer beware!"
1,Skip this game.,"If you haven't played this game, don't bother. It's a waste. It's irritating to use, and it's worse than watching a bad cartoon. This game shouldn't have left the Japanese island."
3,Much bigger than I thought.,I ordered this thinking I could use it as a serving bowl. It is really pretty but it is very large and very heavy. At holiday meals I need serving bowls for enough mashed potatoes for 15-20 people. It will be so heavy I don't know if we will be able to pass it around the table! I am thinking about using it as a centerpiece with some flowers in it. It seems very durable like the rest of the colletion. I just wish it wasn't so heavy.
4,"Very large, but lovely","This bowl is very large, and I find when I'm not using for other things, it makes a lovely fruit bowl. It's unusual to find a set of dishes for which you can get a bowl of this size, which will hold a lot of spaghetti, or other pasta. It's pretty large to go in my cupboard, so it stays on my counter with fruit, and then easily emptied to hold hot foods, when needed."
2,It gets you through...,"Oh, I wish I had the time and the ability to play through Thief without help. I don't, so I bought this guide to save me the hours I would have spent reloading after I died or failed.In this respect, this book works for just that purpose. When I felt I had the time, I explored the levels and often found much better ways to play. When I didn't, I skimmed the chapter and found a servicable way through the level.As other reviewers stated, it's not what it advertises. (Can I sue Prima for false advertising?) It won't show you all the loot, and the strategy part isn't much better than the manual that came with the game.IMHO, it's worth searching for online walkthroughs first."
2,This book is incomplete and that pissed me off!,"I bought Thief: The Dark Project the other day, and after playing it for a week, decided a strategy guide would be helpful; after all, there's no way I had the time explore every inch of every level, and would like to go back and replay the old levels, finding all the treasure and easter eggs.When I saw Prima's strategy guide, it said on the cover ""find all the loot."" I thought good: now I can find all the loot. I took the book home, and by the time I read the first actual mission-related chapter, I realized the book was hopelessly incomplete. I found more treasure on the first level just playing than they did making the strategy guide.There are no new maps in this book. The information on levels is incomplete. There are a few secrets I didn't find, and there are general descriptions of how to beat each level, but these are really superfluous given the easy play of Thief.In short, I was disappointed."
1,Save Your Money!!!,"Although the book claims to be a comprehensive strategy guide, it is nothing more than an expanded instruction booklet. The walk-thrus are week, and incomplete at best. For example, in the expert level of the Sword you are required to find incriminating evidence. The book fails to tell the reader where find it. The maps are nothing more than screen shots of maps included in the game, not in depth maps that show complete layouts. The strategy portion of the book is material that can be known by reading the read me file on the actual game disk. For these reasons, I think it would be best to not purchase this book and save your money."
2,Waste of Cash,"Well, the book isn't what it advertises as many have already stated. I claims (on the cover) to show you the locations of all the loot and such. Inside, however, the author starts off by saying that the book *does not* show all locations! So, if you want to find all the loot, this is not the book to get. It basically shows the quickest (and most boring) way through each level. I'd suggest you look for online guides before you buy this book."
1,What a waste of money!!,"This is one of the absolute worst guides that I have ever purchased. The cover promises that it contains 'Locations For All The Loot'. To me, that means that it will tell you where every item in the game can be found. It doesn't. The book mainly consists of very limited walkthroughs. It only tells you where about 5% of the hidden treasures really are. You have to find the other 95% by yourself. Do yourself a favor and don't buy the book. It's really not worth it."
1,Not worth it.,"If you're a goalie and want to strengthen yourself for the game, don't bother purchasing this product. Just get in the weight-room and do exercises for toning your muscles (low weight, high repetition). Although, weight training is not necessary for goaltending in any expert opinion. This DVD is not put together by anyone who'd really know much about the game, and philosophy of a goaltender."
3,watch for free on Frontline website,"Unless you must have a copy of the DVD for your personal collection, this documentary can be seen for free on Frontline's website. (Along with a number of other good documentaries produced by Frontline.)"
2,Diesel Green,There is a reason this is marked down incredibly from its retail price. It is a very green(no-pun intended) synthetic mess. Very small projection cloud and weak longevity. Scent is a either like it or hate it. Definately one of the worst from this house (aside from zero plus). Cheap plastic top and aweful sprayer make this more of a decorative piece in my collection then anything. If you are looking for a pleasing green scent try lacoste essential or 212 for men.
2,Horrible Sprayer,"I need to get the colonge out and do not caare how ridiculous the sprayer is...Looks like a handgrenade, works like sh..!"
2,Bug Spray Bottle and Bug Spray Scent,I love diesel cologne. Fuel for life and plus plus are on my top list. This one does not smell right on me. I dont even like the smell of it on paper. a catastrophe of nonsense is the best way to describe it. The bottle looks awesome but the spray nozzle is poorly designed. it shoots out like a windex nozzle. If Fuel for life and Plus Plus smell good on you then stay away from this.
3,NOT BAD!,I never had this cologne before this recent purchase so I did not know what to expect. I like the fragrance but it is not for everyone. It has a very woody smell and should be used sparingly.
5,"Great Cologne, Perfect Price, My New Favorite","Smells AMAZING and cannot beat the price anywhere else other than AMAZON. I purchased this and the Diesel Red Cologne to try. I was dissapointed in the smell of the Red Cologne, it smelled too powdery and almost feminine, but I was happy that the Green Cologne smelled just right. It's a masculine smell - woodsy and citric. Not too overpowering either. If this is a limited or special edition, I should go ahead and buy a few more, because I will miss this one if it ever becomes extinct."
2,"It's zany, it's wacky, it's NOT FUNNY!","This movie is the perfect example of writers and/or producers trying TOO HARD to be funny. The casting is extensive; overly so, as the only worthwhile parts of this film are those involving the beautiful women cast as vampire & prey. They are, in fact, the ONLY redeeming ingredient in this video, but you'll have to wade thru all the lame attempts at comedy to get there!"
3,"Tina Krause needs a new manager (or a manager, period)","This video is worth seeing, but only for the beautiful Tina Krause. For this reason alone, I'm giving the video 3 stars, and kudos to its makers. The rest of the movie, though, is pretty lame; I'd have to side with the Apollo Leisure Guide reviewer who says that ""the sound is awful, the script mindless and the rest is simply boring"" (although this is a little too generous. Sometimes you can tell when these Internet reviewers know a film's producer or director, and are going easy on a film because it was made by a friend.)"
1,Very low budget--save your money--not what I was expecting..,"In the tradition of Mel Brooks and the movie Airplane, hardly! Not even in the same category. Very, very dissapointed. A cheap t and a movie that does nothing more than rip off the Titanic name and all of its memories. Save your money. They probably made back what they paid to make this movie when I made the mistake of buying it."
4,Moon Rocks -- a view of what the scientists thought and did when examining lunar rocks for the first time.,"Henry S.F. Cooper takes you to the Lunar Recieving Station and reports what the scientists did with the rocks and how thier discoveries either upheld or overturned competing theories. Being a journalist, Henry not only gives you the scientific facts about the rocks, but also the human drama that unfolded when scientists with competing theories met and discussed why they were right (and the other guy was wrong). A well written account of what happened as the rocks were being examined."
4,"This was purchased as a present for me, and I am enjoying it.","I'm enjoying this album, it can be a bit chaotic for basic background music, but overall I like to listen to it when not much else is going on around me."
5,Awesume!!!!!!!!!,"if i had a lady who sang too me like this, i would just sit and stare at her all day, but i dont, so i gotta keep what i got. go out and Cop this cd (thats slang for buy it)."
1,Average,"That's about the best one can say about this collection of songs...average or less. On second thought, it is highly overrated."
2,"Great Expecations, Sad Reality","I ordered these in hopes of saving space on my desk, which they accomplished. I was replacing some really old computer speakers from the late 90s that we probably got for less than $5. To my dismay, these ViewSonics couldn't even compete with the sound quality --what I thought was horrible quality-- of my old speakers. The sound was absolute garabage, from games to iTunes to Comcast's Internet TV, it was horrible sound quality so I temporarily reverted back to my old $5 speakers. I get better sound quality from my iPod's iTalk mono speaker attachment. ViewSonic should keep to what they do best, nice overpriced monitors. People, don't waste your money, there are better options here on Amazon (in the 50-70 range unfortunately) from other brands."
3,This system is not what is shown in the picture!,It seems that the system does not include the subwoofer and control as right now. I have ordered and returned the item to Amazon to get the complete system but still no luck.
3,Wrong Item!!!,They sent me the wrong speakers 2 times without the subwoofers and I ask for money back the last time. Amazon did a horrible job putting the wrong title and picture on this. Don't buy this product from amazon because you are porbably going to get the wrong item like me and other customers.
5,Fit the bill!,With my prime account it was shipped quickly and does a great job holding my bananas while looking great in my kitchen!
4,useful product,it is exactly as described but somewhat overpriced. the last banana can be attached horizontally. therefore it is a well designed product.
4,Cheater Chopsticks,"I bought these for my 3 year old son after going to a Japanese rest. for dinner. He loves eating with them but does have some difficulty but I believe that is due to his age, he is three. I think when he is a little older he will do even better with them but he has eaten several meals with them already and enjoys eating with them."
2,Format Deception,"Sounds all right, but this is NOT a hybrid SACD, despite how it is listed on Amazon."
5,Beautiful and exciting music,I love this music. One of my favorite movies is The Four Seasons and Vivaldi was a major part of its appeal.
5,One of the BEST,"I have read a number of books on this topic, and needless to say, this was the best one, of all. Chuck's humble approach, and real-life illustrations, helped me to APPLY what I read, immediately!Thank you, Chuck Swindoll, and thank You, God, for loving us so much that You are patient with our feeble attempts to understand You!"
3,"A ""Me' Centered Approach to God's Will","The book is somewhat helpful in comforting those who find God's will and ways mysterious and perplexing. However, this volume, despite its instruction to think theologically, falls into a man-centered--me-centered--approach to God's will, exhibiting greater concern about ""God's will for my life"" than about God's will for God Himself, and ignoring crucial biblical portions regarding God's will in relation to God's purpose and heart's desire. Revelation 4:11 and Ephesians 1, for example, are not given due consideration. As a result, this book, with a subtitle pointing to ""me"" and ""my,"" as is so common today, is only a slightly above average approach to the will of God, which has less to do with ""me"" and more about the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:1-5)."
5,This Is A Must Read!,This book has help me so much. I have also given it as a gift to more people than ever before in my life. Life Changing!
3,IT'S GOOD,"THIS ALBUM IS PRETTY TIGHT, IT HAS SOME OF THE BEST SONGS PUT OUT BY SICK WID IT RECORDS, ""SPRINKLE ME"" I'M SURE EVERY 1 HEARD THAT ONE FROM E-40'S ""IN A MAJOR WAY"", I LIKE THAT SONG, ""IT'S GOING DOWN"" FROM CELLY CEL IS JUST A CLASSIC....THIS ALBUM HAS ALOT OF TIGHT SONGS I'M SURE ALOT OF U ARE FAMILIAR WITH, BUT IF U DONT HAVE ANY OTHER SICK WID IT ALBUMS, COP THIS ONE IT HAS THE BEST OF ALL ALBUMS, ALSO U PEOPLE SHOULD CHECK OUT ALL 4 OF CELLY CEL'S ALBUMS, THE FIRST ONE HE RELEASED WAS ""HEAT 4 YO AZZ"" ON SICK WID IT, 2ND WAS ""KILLA KALI"", WHICH I THINK IS HIS GREATEST WORK TO DATE, BUT ALL HIS ALBUMS ARE TIGHT, THIRDS WAS ""THE G FILES"", ALSO ON SICK WID IT, THAT ALBUM HAS THE IT'S GOING DOWN REMIX, WHICH IS THE PHATTEST ! THEN HE LEFT SICK WID IT AND RELEASED ""DEEP CONVERSATION"" COP THAT 1 TOO, OH YAH HE'S MAKING A GROUP NAMED ""CRIMINALZ"" WHICH INCLUDES CELLY CEL, SPICE 1, AND JAYO FELONY, NOW U KNOW THAT GROUP IS GONNA BE TIGHT ! SO COP ALL HIS ALBUMS, PEACE...."
4,lots of fun,"Claudia is a new college freshman, and newly single, having recently broken up with her high-school-long boyfriend. She meets a cute guy within hours of coming to campus, and is horrified to find herself tongue-tied. Her new roommate suggests that she might need flirting practice after being with one guy for so long. Her proposition: meet and talk to one new guy a day for the month of September, just to get practice. Claudia gamely agrees. After all, what could it hurt? At the very least, she'll meet new people and improve her skills. At most? Well, out of thirty guys, who's to say one of them won't be Mr. Right? After all, Claudia knows that Mr. Right never has a girlfriend, so she may as well keep looking. This story goes deeper than it's flirting lessons. It's also about friendship, true love, and making life want you want it to be. The characters are clever and relatable, and it's an overall fun read."
1,Alot better out there.......Try and find it...,"Unlike other reviewers I am trying to forget I bought this CD. I am a rock fan. LOVE ROCK MUSIC. I thought there was a winner here with tons of artists I recognized but most of the songs absolutely... Great artists but their worst work. MTV2's new album, Handpicked, does a great job with alternative rock music as there are tons of great songs on it......LOADED with at least 8 but this one... in comparison as there were 1-2 songs I really liked.I was personally VERY suprised how few good songs there were on this one..........There are alot of artists you know but not their best work, let alone good work.Spend your money on better albums folks. Do another...search for rock compilations and, most importantly, listen to the album first. I wished I did. I wish I had some other great compilations to provide but they are few and far between. Hopefully MTV will quit harming their brand image by putting out... like this."
3,MtV's Rock,"MTV's latest offering of The Return of Rock is far superior to the previous sampling of new metal. It displays plenty of new talent, as well as some older more established talent. It spits up some violent pounding agression on Soulfly, Marilyn Manson, and the Deftones, as well as slapping in a couple more up and comers, like Disturbed and UPO. All in all I would say that the cd is good, especially considering that it is put out by the same company that carries that the thong song and britney spears as its standards of ""Talent."""
2,Another Coaster From MTV,"If you're a real rock fan, then you pretty much own this CD. I gave it one star more than its predecessor because it's got more exclusive and rare tracks, such as Papa Roach's ""Legacy,"" acoustic Deftones, two decent live cuts from Limp Bizkit and Marilyn Manson, and Orgy's ""The Spectrum,"" which was included in the first shipment of Vapor Transmission, and then removed. It also contains Disturbed's ""God of the Mind,"" but this band is pretty pathetic so it doesn't make it worth it. Same goes for the P.O.D remix: lame band.Like Volume 1, the rest of the music is pretty impressive, but it's all been previously released. But also like it's predecessor, it's a good sampler for anyone just getting into harder music. You're better off purchasing this then the upcoming Valentine soundtrack, which looks to be completely devoid of new or rare material."
5,LOS EXITOS DEL GRAN SERGIO VARGAS!,"""Grandes Exitos"" es lo que podras encontrar en este CD. Una excelente recopilacion de los mejores exitos del gran interprete dominicano Sergio Vargas. ""La Ventanita"", ""Ni Tu Ni Yo"", 'Aquello Que Me Distes"" y ""Dolorcito"" son alguno de los temas que encontraras en este disco. Con un solo disco no basta para tener todos los exitos de Sergio Vargas que desde su lanzamiento solo ha tenido un exito tras otro. Si te gusta Sergio Vargas te gustaran los siguientes: ""Pasional"" de Jessica Cristina, ""Que Hable La Musica"" de Marco Hernandez, ""Con Uñas Y Dientes"" de Irisneyda y ""Grandes Exitos"" de Juan Luis Guerra."
1,Don't buy this book,I don't know how you stumbled upon finding this book but don't buy it. I stole it from a library and it was so bad I snuck it back in and gave it back.
2,not what I was expecting,"I bought this for my niece when she stays with me for a weekend. I was looking to get some music that would be calming and familiar but there are only 4 songs out of 20 that I know. Also I was expecting an instrumental cd, I'll use this cd but will be getting another one to use more often."
3,It is ok!,The selection is alright. I also bought another lullaby CD along with this one and my baby seems to like the other one much much better. I rarely play this one.
4,Great for Sleep,Great for helping kids to fall aSleep. As well as learn to appreciate music. Would recommends to others. Good price
2,Do not like this at all,I do not know why it says Disney because it is actually not from Disney. The songs are old fashinoned and I thought it was just something esle
3,Not for kids,"This stove is made to fold flat, and that's what it does best. The 'hook' to keep it upright is shallow and unseats itself with just a puff of breeze, plus the hinges are very loose. Ours collapsed while we were cooking a small pan of soup. Someone lightly bumped the picnic table and the stove promptly folded, sending soup all over the tabletop. In my opinion it isn't stable enough to be used by kids and precarious to use even by adults.Having said that, if you taped the hinges in place and didn't worry about refolding it, it is handy. It's bigger than the Esbit and could handle larger, heavier pots. We used Esbit fuel in it and Sterno could be used as well. It would also work for warming or a fondue pot, but again, I would recommend stabilizing it in some way."
5,Emergency Stove,"I haven't yet used the stove, but it is perfect for in an emergency kit. It folds small, uses cheap compact fuel, and is quite durable and sturdy. It's a great priced option for those who don't want to spend a lot of money, but have a reliable product when needed"
4,Works as I Had Hoped,"I got this little folding stove so we could have something hot when the power went out. Tried boiling water and it worked very well. Bought a few more and gave away as Holiday ""stocking stuffers"" to coworkers and family.It was strong enough to hold a regular sized pot or a small frying pan. If you're looking for a short term emergency stove or something for picnicking or camping, I'd recommend it."
3,Too Much Magic?,"I thought this was one of the best written books of this nature I've read in a long time. The author made it an easy, fun read and easy to understand. She wrote as if she was actually trying to convey a story to us, instead of impress us with her vocabulary, scientific knowledge, etc. as so many current S/F-Fantasy writers seem to try to do nowdays. However, my two criticisms would be that she gets a little carried away with the magic part of the story, and it gets a little overblown for me. And I discovered that this was a continuing-sequel book. This is probably fine with most readers, but not with me, and the book did not give any hint from the cover, etc. that there was a sequel in the works. I simply don't generally read sequel books, so I'll pass on future offerings from her."
3,Fantasy? Mystery? History?,"Sky Knife's story line was a little too dependent on magic and a little light on practicality for my taste. The characters were interesting, but the book was a little tol rushed and they did not get a chance to develop as well as they could have been."
5,SHAME SHE ONLY WROTE 5 BOOKS,Wonderful page turner!! I really didn't know who did it until the last few pages!! Bowers would be as famous as Christie had she lived longer. Highly recommended Golden Age mystery!
2,Box not as advertised,The ad blurb stated the game came in a box that was 7x5x2-what I rc'vd was in a cheesy cd sleeve-not in a box.
2,Don't waste your money!,"I'd like to give this game five stars. It's fun, fast, and and entertaining and I really enjoy playing it. Unfortunately they designed a couple of the levels too hard. Level 5-4, for example. It's nearly impossible to get through this level. If you do, they have an even harder version of it later in the game. Do a search for Luxor 5-4 or 8-4 and you'll see tons of comments about people stuck on these levels.I feel like it wasted my money, because I can't play the whole game. And these troublesome levels do not show up in the one hour trial version."
2,Very disappointed!,"I made it to the 9th stage and enjoyed it along the way BUT it is virtually impossible to get past the second segment of the 9th stage. If you enjoy stress and anxiety then you will love this game. Personally, I consider it to be worth maybe half of what I paid for it."
3,Doesn't work with Vista 64,"Although I enjoyed this game, I did not like it nearly as much as Zuma as I found it much more difficult and found it hard to get past the higher levels. Another frustrating feature is that you can not return to the level you missed but have to return to an earlier level to play through to the challenged level. This prevents you from practising on a difficult level.The true problem came when I installed Vista, in my case 64-bit Vista, and it stopped working completely. Notice that it shows in the description that it is only compatible with XP."
3,Good Entertainment,"I found this book to be very entertaining. Red is an interesting villain with almost supernatural abilities. I began to wonder if he was going to be like Jason and not be able to be killed. The interaction of Bill and Claire is good, especially when he watches her after she has been kidnapped by Red. The book has a little bit of everything, romance, sex, violence."
1,Don't go in This woods......,"Stay away... go watch the USA network movie of the week instead. This bomb of an adventure novel starts low (stalked women) and sinks lower (blowing away the bad guys private parts). How creative! Come on, I've read some really bow wow books in my time but this doesn't even attempt to be the least bit creative in its narrative. I've read more involving writings in the classified sections of travel magazines. Stay away, spen your money on the Everest non-fiction adventure ""IN THIN AIR"" instead. Compared to this ""Survival Games"" truth IS Stranger Than Fiction......"
2,Overpriced and Underdelivered,"This pillow is ok, but its not worth 100 bucks. This is more like a 30 or 40 dollar item. It doesnt deliver all the alignment of the spine as it promises, and is often too constrictive to sleep with thru out the night. Get a straight pillow, one that is body length. That will deliver all that this does, at a fraction of the cost."
1,Not as comfy as i thought it would be for the money :(,"I bought this because my back & belly need some support while sleeping...but this pillow doesn't help. It's WAY TOOOO BIG..for my queen size bed..It divides me & my boyfriens up completely..i always have to sleep with two pillows under my head, so this pillow doesn't allow me to because it's so bulky..I have now switched this pillow around & reversed it so the Head Part of the Pillow is now at my feet & I use it as a foot elavation pillow. NOT worth the $$$ I would just buy the Tummy Wedge by Boppy for Belly Support :) Cheaper & does the job! Hope this helps any new mommy's out there...I wonder if i could send it back?? It's been a little over 3 weeks?? Hummmm??"
2,They changed the filling,"I had the first version of this in 2006 when I was pregnant. It was filled with tiny pellets, something like a beanbag, which made it easier to redistribute to get a really comfortable fit with your body, no matter what position you slept in. It lasted me three years.After a year of not sleeping as comfortably, I bought the same pillow again rather than buy the cheap one-sided body pillows at a store. Unfortunately, since my first pillow they've changed the pillow and now it's more of a standard batting that you'd find with a regular pillow. It does not conform, it does not mold, and it is not as remotely comfortable as the first Comfort-U pillow I owned.I could have gone with two regular old body pillows from Target and had the same (not quite comfortable) experience at a much cheaper price. Truthfully, sometimes I find it more comfortable to sleep without it."
4,Great for Tall people,"I love this pillow! Have used since 12 weeks pregnant and it has been great. As other comments have stated, the u-shape is rather tight, so I would suggest using another pillow on top of it (which helps to prop you up if you have heartburn related to prenancy). However, being 5'8"" I actually found it most useful with the U at the bottom and using my normal pillows. This gave support for my entire hip/leg and the back part kept me from rolling on my side. Also works well during the day, fold up the sides add another pillow and it makes a great cozy chair pillow. I think it will also work well for breastfeeding when the time comes. Needs to be fluffed from time to time, and I purchased a seperate pillowcase, the one that comes with is a little rough if you are using as your head pillow, but fine for a body pillow."
5,not an easy exchange procedure compared to working directly with amazon.,"sizing descriptions on web site are poor, so needed to exchange for another size. Costly to do so. not an easy procedure like working with Amazon directly. I wish you handled the customer servcie for your off shoot companies. I buy through amazon and expect amazon service."
5,Great value from Amazon!,We bought these for our son-in-law who is a lineman for an electric company in a very cold climate. This was a great value from Amazon on a great product that keeps him warm and is durable.
1,Carhartt Arctic Bib Overall,"This product is NOT an Arctic bib. When we received it, there is no extra lining, much less any type of quilt lining. Very misleading."
3,Not as good as the 2006 World Series Film,"This film was ""ok"" but not as well done as the 2006 World Series film. I'm still glad I purchased it but the 2006 film was much better."
5,Just what I expected!,"In a word, Epic! Started with the pre season drama of Pujols moving into free agency and Wainright being out for the year with an elbow injury, dealt with the drama of slumping players at the start of the regular season, to the post All Star break and our wild race to the post season with the Cardinal's win and the Brave's loss. Then detailed reviews of every post season experience, especially detailed with each of the 7 games of the world series. This movie showed the comeback spirit and the never give up spirit of the Cardinal's baseball organization. A must have for any real fan!"
5,Ideal present.,"This item was purchased for the most important person in my life: my husband. That was a nice surprise for him the day he got this present. He has watched the video over and over. It means, a good product."
3,Great Picture Quality - wish Game 6 was included,Great blu ray picture on this. I'm not sure why game 6 of the world series was not included in its entirety. Instead Game 5 of Philadelphia Series is there. That game is great but no runs are scored the last 8 innings so it doesn't quite have the appeal for repeated viewings. I guess they kept game 6 for the more expensive Collectors edition.
5,Very good bluray worth the money,"A very good and well compiled bluray with tons of unexpected extras. Extras include a prime 9 list of Tony La Russa moments, complete NLCS Game 5, the World Series parade and more. All in one disc is 4+ hours of footage. If you can, purchase the bluray version of this awesome product."
5,Go Cards!,The dvd was exactly what I ordered and it came in the mail very fast. I had no problems with this buyer.
4,Always a Good Deal!,I have purchased every WS video since 1996 and am rarely disappointed. The 2011 World Series ranks up with the most exciting I ever saw and Game 6 was the most exciting game I have ever watched in all the years I have been watching baseball! The video itself has a new narrator that is not as good as in years past (hence I didn't give it the full five stars) but some of the extras are novel. There is a second DVD included with the National League clinching game. The bonus fearures have David Frees' walkoff 6th game homerun repeated 5 times with different announcers including international announcers. The postgame interview with Lance Berkman and Frees was priceless. Frees talks about growing up and watching a walk-off homerun in St. Louis' 2004 playoffs not realizing that Berkman played in the game for the Astros. This drew a nice chuckle.
5,Cards 2011 Champs,This is the best DVD in our set of Sport's DVD's. I recommend this to anyone who loves baseball and Game 6 of the WS was the best ever. Go Cards in 2012!
5,Must buy for any Cardinal fan!,A lot of looks at what most fans didn't see during the broadcasts. A must buy for any Cardinal fan!
4,Shakespeare's Ghost,"Anthony Burgess's biography of Shakespeare makes for riveting reading. However, the reader arguably learns more about Queen Elizabeth and the Earl of Essex than about the elusive Mr. Shakespeare.In fact, Shakespeare makes only occasional and shadowy appearances in this bio as if he were the ghost of Hamlet's father (which he is, in a sense). Burgess doesn't hesitate to put his own stylish and imaginative spin on what little we know about Shakespeare, though if he were to shed any more light the shadow would disappear.Nevertheless, by coupling his considerable breadth of learning with documentary evidence, Burgess manages to accomplish what I think he sets out to accomplish in writing this book - that upon completion the reader will say with certainty, ""Shakespeare did exist."""
1,Citronella Geranium Died,"My plant arrived in what appeared to be decent shape, it had a few wilty leaves, which I would expect since it was shipped over half way across the country, but even though I followed the instructions the condition of the plant just got worse and worse and I think it's now dead. It's unfortunate, because it smelled good and I was looking forward to having such a unique plant on my back porch."
5,Naughty By Nature!!,"This plant was delivered to me in record time! I just love it! The fragrant was so lovely and the plan was packed well. This is the fall season and I wish that I would have had it at the beginning of the summer. This will make a beautiful landscaping plant to help with the demise of the insect population; around my home. Such a wonderful way to keep the bugs away. I can't wait to see if it works.Otherwise it is such a pretty plan that I will enjoy it as well. Get this plant, so that you can have it by next summer!!"
4,Nice toolset,A very nice toolset from x-acto that comes in a neat wooden box. The only negative thing I noticed is the grip on #2 blade. It was not as I expected... Blade makes an insignificant tilt on your first cut backwards. This is as I mentioned insignificant but I would expect perfect quality from x-acto
4,Christmas in P.R. is like no other,"One of our stand-out singers in Puerto Rico, although without much international fame, explodes with impressive talent. Revealing some of our most classic songs and sung with feeling as would no other is Danny Rivera. Accompanied by EL CORO DE NINOS DE SAN JUAN, your christmas spirit will surely lighten up. Some of the songs might not click at first but when heard memories will appear in your mind evoking feelings of joy, happiness and maybe sorrow in memories of those who have left us behind. Celebrate this Jesus's birthday with one of the most outstanding Christmas albums ever recorded. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!"
5,Steele yourself,"Another Barbra Steele gem. She was so very much the perfect female for creepy evil horror stories that no one takes 2nd place. If you see her name you rent or buy to watch the virgin queen/ harlot sorcerer of flawless skin & innocent / ravenously voiced fame.The Castle of Blood is an old tale of the family that is cursed. There is black evil in its past that lives & re-lives even to the current day. It is the writer, director, lighting & camera man that have learned how to play against Barbara's talents that makes this the enjoyable movie that it is. Understand, this is not Oscar award winning anything but there's no category for what Barbara Steele does better than anyone in the world. Be sure to see ""Mask of Satan"" the European cut & she's in ""Shivers"" by David Cronenberg. Enjoy! 5 Steeles or Stars!"
3,Deep Dish Gothic Extravagance,"The simple fact is that this kind of film is a specialized taste. Imagine an old Universal horror film with the budget ramped way down and the Gothicism ramped way, way up.It's like an extravagantly rich cheesecake, not everybody appreciates a flavor so strong and cloying. You have to love thick gothic atmosphere, stagey black & white cinematography lingering long on a dark castle full of dust, suits of armor, strange sounds and...something else. Much of the film's first half hour is devoted to the protagonist simply & silently exploring the castle by torchlight. There are other things here to enjoy, a ripely macabre plot and the eerie beauty of Barbara Steele, but this film is for those who relish lush Gothicism for its own sake. And you know who you are."
4,EA's Opinion,"I remember watching this as a young child, and wanted it for my collection....retro horror"
3,Gothic Steele,"Not the best horror film Barbara Steele did, but worth a watch if you like this type of thing. Man makes a bet about staying overnight in a haunted castle, etc. The gothic style makes the film a little dark."
1,One star is too much!,"In this movie there is a scene where they cut off the head of a live garter snake! It was disgusting, especially when they pan in on it's dead wriggling body. Make beleive blood and guts is one thing but actual cruelty in a movie is a big no no for me."
1,Animal cruelty ruined the movie.,"I usually love this kind of movie, and would have given it 3 stars, four if it had not been for the poor quality print. Unfortunately it was ruined for me with a rather gratuitious and sickening scene where they actually cut off the head of a live garter snake and then pannned in on it's wriggling head and body. It was truly disgusting! Now I can't even sell my copy in good conscience. Actual cruelty to any living creature is intolerable."
2,Castle of Blood,Quick delivery - but what a snore fest. It was better 20 some-odd years ago when I first saw it. Not so scary any more.
3,The Devil made me Do it!,Setting stage for the Adversary cycle. I came to like Jim Stevens and was sad to see him die. He seemed like a goodperson and husband. I wish it could of played out a little different as their child would be like Damien. Some unanswered questions for me about the Evil Vessel all the years before Carol got pregnant.
4,A Need to Read,"Wilson's writing and plotting may not be as top-notch here as they were in his previous books in the Adversary Cycle, but this book provides the link between the earlier ones and the final two novels.The story isn't anything great, but the writing moves things along and there are some exciting scenes, though none are likely to make you lose any sleep.Enjoy this, and move on to complete the cycle."
4,Lovely tribute to Cassie,"This is a touching tribute to the life and legacy of Cassie Bernall.While some Non-Christian listeners might find the Christian format and theme of the CD alienating,I think it is very appropriate considering Cassie's beliefs and how important those beliefs were in her life.The design of the CD cover and booklet is very attractive and striking and somehow seems perfectly suited for a project about Cassie.I also appriecated that inside the booklet there were explanations of what every song is about ,including the two songs on the CD that are about/directly relate to Cassie.A voice clip of Cassie speaking about her beliefs is included at the end of one of the songs and the poem that she wrote that inspired the ""Whatever it takes"" song is reproduced in the CD booklet.Overall its a well done memorial tribute and I hope that people still continue to try to find it and listen to it, even though its out of print now."
4,Hard hitting. Made me understand the environment Punk Rock came from.,"The previous reviewer has done an excellent job of describing the milieu in which the episodes take place. I say ""episodes"" because it's more like a video catching bits and pieces of the life. There's very little narrative interruption or comment.Considering that Dunn had a background in journalism I approached the meaning of the episodes by considering the details and images she used. In each episode and in sum total they provide alot to consider and draw meaning from.It's a very bleak view. But it really stayed with me. As a fan of Punk Music this book made me better understand what the Clash were singing about in 1977 or thereabouts when they had hits with ""City of the Dead"", ""White Riot"", and ""White man at the Hammersmith Palais."""
5,Cool!,"This is a Christmas present for my father-in-law! He is a book worm and has a huge ""library"" Perfect for him!!"
5,I love this thing,"I use it before every chopping task, works great and it's sturdy. Would definitely buy again for the price - except this one will probably last forever."
5,Awesome,King Diamond was a necessity in the '80s. Glad to have him back in my life! No body hits the notes as well as him. Great digital quality.
2,Rushed overview of King Diamond's Roadrunner days,"Like the CD package says, these are the roots of Roadrunner Records. Mercyful Fate frontman King Diamond's solo career was just as influential and underrated and well revered as his band's, and this ""Best Of"" compilation is just as rushed and as much a cash in attempt as the Mercyful Fate ""Best Of"". The tracks you'd expect to be on here are here, including ""Abigail"", and ""Mansion in Darkness"", but with the way CD's are being released these days, you'd figure that a few bonuses would be included like some unreleased tracks, rare demos, or live cuts, but there are none of those here. Not to mention that King Diamond's albums have always told a story, and hearing them all in no real particular order makes this come off as a puzzle without the pieces. This may be worth picking up if your a new fan to King Diamond, but you'd be better off checking out ""Abigail"" first and then the rest of his releases."
2,Ridiculous,"Yeah, I know, King Diamond has a great voice, but he is a little goofy, don't you think? This is more like a 2.5 album, because some of the songs are actually quite good. But most of the song lyrics are a little too goofily evil. And that stupid makeup! KISS did a much better job. This is okay if you like this kind of music, but in my eyes it's kind of dumb."
2,Beatle Attempts Dance (BAD),"OK, I bought it because it was McCartney and that is in fact it's only saving grace: an oddity. This isn't even good dance music for 1993, and god knows dance has come a long way. Boring ""thud thud"" beats. There's nothing trancey about any of the tracks despite the titles like ""trans lunar rising,"" and ""pure trance."" Just a basic tribal beat with occasional chanting and organ whooshes. The king of hooks didn't give us a single one: just monotony. The Manchester Dance scene produced much better music than this. Wouldn't it have been amazing if McCartney did a house/trip-hop record with the poise, grace and melody of ETBG ""Walking Wounded."" That would be something!"
4,Actually bought To use on cats,This is a very mild and safe product. I bought it to put in my cats eyes when cleaning. I've also used it on myself. It's not very viscious so for human use for dry eyes doesn't really do much.
3,A Great Premise And Beginning Lead Down A Road To Nowhere,"I absolutely LOVED the idea and set-up to ""Uniform,"" a film with great potential that failed to really go anywhere with it. Telling the story of a sad sack tailor who has the opportunity to reinvent his life when a police officer leaves his uniform behind, the tale could go in many different directions. Soon, he is conducting traffic shake downs and using his newfound confidence to woo a new lady friend. I enjoyed the quiet build and transformation in the first half of the film--it is subtle and successful. But I soon felt like the picture had nowhere to go after establishing its premise.The slacker appeal of the main character is really effective in creating an early mood, but eventually his lack of momentum takes over the film. Appealing actors and a nice beginning had me thinking I would make this a big recommendation. But not fulfilling the earlier promise left me somewhat apathetic to the end result. KGHarris, 5/11."
2,Not a good book for 2 year olds,"I got this book for my two year old and she did like the book, for two minutes. The stickers were too hard for her to get off the paper and she was very frustrated, and by the time we manage to get the stickers off, they would stick to each other. Just alot of frustration. Not worth the money. She played with it for 20 minutes at the most."
2,Low quality,"I bought this and one of the Roger Priddy sticker books for my 2 year old daugher. Although she liked this book and it was more appropriate for her age, it was very poor quality compared to the other book (of course it also cost less). The stickers were hard to peel off the backing and stuck together or ripped. A lot of the stickers are little tiny squares or circles, and many of ours didn't end up looking like squares or circles by the time we got them peeled off the backing because they weren't punched out enough at the factory. I would really recommend one of the Priddy books, although they do require more adult assistance in finding where the stickers go, etc."
1,This book is a stinker!!,"I struggled to read this diatribe on Mr. Krallinger's years of M&A experience. The author tries to layout the M&A process to the average business person. He provides an appendix full of checklists, a timeline, and some very common sense do's and don't's. The rest of the book is filled with the author's unsubstantiated assertions, poor economic thinking, and xenophobic biases.I brought the book to better understand the M&A process from a gritty, in-the-trenches prospective, but walked away feeling that I wasted my time filtering out the author's failings to find a few good nuggets.Don't waste your time and money on this one."
1,Merge This Book with a Trash Can,"I had hoped to use this book as a training tool for my staff - - it's promoted as a guide to the process. However, after evaluating a copy, I believe the better course of action is to have them watch my six year old trade Pokemon cards. There is more logic and strategy behind his activity than in this entire book."
1,Let us be serious!,"This book insults the intelligence of any reader who owns at least one neurone. It also insults other true books concerning mergers and acquisitions. The advices the book contains are like this: ""Warning! Don't pay twice for a company. You pay once when you buy it, and you could pay twice if you need to restructure it"". Please, pick your brains!"
1,"Choose another Spanish book, if you can.","As a Spanish teacher and native speaker I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst student. I had the ""pleasure"" to teach this book for 3 years (formerly named ""Bienvenidos"", ""A bordo"" and ""Buen Viaje"")and I didn't like it the least. The publishers came up with a new format this year but although it looks more attractive you can still find many of the SAME old activities and many of the old pictures. The vocabulary section at the end of each chapter don't have the English translation what makes it quite difficult for the student when reviewing vocabulary. They have improved the culture sections,though; but still it is not good enough. If you learn Spanish using this book, please THANK your teacher, he/she has a lot of work to do when using this book. Buena suerte!"
5,The greatest male voice around is back!,"Having been a huge fan is Russ Taff's for 15 years now, I eagerly await any new album. His music always seems so personal, like the songs really mean something to him. His voice is a good as ever. The songs are typical Taff. The only misstep is one called 'Things Will Be Different' which lyrically is out of place here, but a decent song. The final song, 'Shadow of the Cross' is in three 'movements', and is like nothing on any of his other albums. Very dramatic, very passionate, and very well done. This guy is awesome. Thanks, Russ Taff, for finally coming back. May you sell enough albums to continue recording, but not enough to ruin you. God bless you."
1,Great Voice matched with Substandard Songs,"I love Russ Taff. Praise God for him and his talent, but this CD disappointed me greatly. With spectacular CDs in the past which matched his great vocals with spectacular, annointed songs (eg. Under Their Influence - a cd of covers - sadly the songwriters are not credited, and The Way Home), this one struck me as relatively void of the same calibre of material."
5,A Must for Tufts Vet Students,This book was very helpful in passing Dr. Engelking's Physiology course. I would STRONGLY recommend it for any Tufts vet students.
4,Making the Civil Rights Movement Relevant to College Sudents,"Debbie Louis brings the youth and experiences of the civil rights movement back to life and relevant to young students. Too often what is salient to professors and the people who lived the movement means nothing but ""old history"" to young people needing to learn the lessons of the past for the future. This book helps make that journey back real, useful and exciting. Also...a book with a broader perspective of the players and the stakes than more typical narrow accounts!"
4,"serious, satisfying music from one of the greats","Like all of his best work, this album will take a few hard listens before you can fully assimilate it. But it's well worth it. With seasoned personnel in place, this outing takes more risks and provides better opportunities for Bernie Worrel and Vernon Reid to really take off. The Cream re-makes here are not nearly as objectionable or as jarring as the previous album. We're Going Wrong and I Feel Free are terrific although I'm not sure if the world really needs yet another version of Politician. The new compositions are mature and intricate and most of the material realy soars - with the band being well meshed, and very intense. Bruce's wildly eclectic taste may frustrate some, in the form of a cabaret number here or a vaguely post-Jobim do-dad there - but overall, this is a really solid, dense, thoughtful effort worth one's attention."
4,"""jamming jack"" in top form","The new Jack Bruce cd updates 3 Cream songs and 11 new Bruce tracks. One listen won't sell you on this set, but listen closer and this is Jack Bruce at 60 years old and still sounding fine. 41/2 stars total. Best tracks ""Kelly's Blues"",""I feel free"", ""Cold Island"" and ""Politician"". Best work since How's Tricks back in 1977. If you like good music i recommened this disc. Stay away Linkin Park and Limp [Bizkit] fans. Oh i mean, you know what i mean!"
4,It really helps with the unplugging routine,Since installing the powered port hub I can rest easier. I don't have to constantly plug and unplug accessories. The one problem with the unit it that when you boot up you get unwanted items on the screen. Other than that all seems fine.
4,"Great size, functional","I just bought this because my previous USB hub was not working properly. As soon as I installed it all my peripherals worked perfectly. I have not had it long, so I hope it keeps working well. I will update if I have any problems."
1,High Pitch Ringing Noise,"The hub works fine, the only problem is a very high pitch ringing noise coming from the unit constantly!!! I can't use the hub due to the mind numbing noise. Very disappointed because the design was very appealing and it works well."
3,looks nice but it requires external power,"This is a nice USB hub, it works well and looks of decent quality. The only problem is that it requires external power, so you will need to plug the power brick that comes with it. I wish this was explained on the product description but they conveniently leave that out."
1,Only worked for about 2 months,This is the second Belkin USB hub that I've had problems with. This one died after about 2 months of light use. Steer clear of them.
1,Another piece of sub-par consumer digital connection equipment -- UHHG!,"The Belkin F5U237 Rev. 3 hub worked decently for a bit and then stopped being recognized and dropping devices.Unfortunately, this is true of most consumer-ish digital connection equipment (USB hubs, Ethernet switches & routers, etc). I with someone would come out with the Cisco (NOT Linksys) equivalent of a USB hub. And to the people at Belkin who so poorly built this -- to last only a few months -- it's not even the 50 bucks I lost with this device that bothers me, it's the time I had to take to figure out what was going wrong and re-saving, re-printing and locked up computers this caused. You people should really be ashamed of yourselves. One star is a gift, Belkin."
1,Not worth it,"I purchased this item Jan 2006. It has already quit recognizing any of the items plugged into it. My USB printer went beserk when I plugged it in - never could get a page to print, so I direct connected into my laptop and all was fine. Now my camera dock and PDA are not recognized. I have contacted the warranty people via email - told me to call. Contacted Belkin and they gave me an RMA # to return the item."
1,Prevented the computer from booting,The hub prevents the computer from booting. Search on the web found that numerous others had the same problem. Belkin was unable to provide any support and it seems the only solution is to purchase a different hub. The hub is nicely designed and works fine once the computer is booted and the unit is plugged in.
1,Junk!,"I've owned two of these hubs, neither work any longer. After about 8 months, the power supplies start to fail and the hubs become intermittant (some ports don't work), then they die completely. I won't be buying any more Belkin products."
1,really poor product,"i've tried numerous USB hubs and this was one of the many poor ones. it functions as a USB hub, but the charing capability broke after two weeks.seemingly no one makes high quality USB hubs. Avoid this product"
2,Worked for two years then failed suddenly,"This hub was brilliant while it worked - after just over 2 years, it suddenly failed - blech - goodness, this is not something one expects to 'wear out' - it has no moving parts!"
2,Does not handle unpowered devices like iPods.,"Overall does what a hub should do. Works 100% with powered devices like printers and scanners. But it doesn't like iPods: the connection will be lost (not a good idea to disconnect an iPod without ""ejecting"" it), or no connection will be made at all, or the port on the computer where the hub is connected will lock up.Also, the build quality is poor. The silver finish is uneven, even worn off (out of the box) in a few spots. And the clear cover over the LED indicators is falling off.Perhaps Belkin's new ""Plus"" hubs are better, but I'm not willing to find out.Belkin USB 2.0 Plus Hub (7 Port) F5U307-BRN"
2,failed after 2 years,"Nice design and it worked well for 2 years, then failed. Not what I would expect for a belkin product. Shopping for another maker next time."
3,polar express elf cart,"Toy cart is cute, but too small and not enough weight to make it operate smoothly. Would need a magnifying glass to see the ""elves""."
1,Terrible little Elves,"I am a long time Lionel user and buyer. I received the Polar Express Elf Car for Christmas and found it to be much less than expected. The car is much smaller than expected for such a high price. The elves hang on to the hand operator of the car but unfortunately, jam the motion because they swing too far. When they jam the motion, the car comes to a complete stop. One way to fix the car would be to glue the elves so they don't rotate. Not sure I want to do this. I have had this thing around the track twice and it is awful."
2,Not a good Polar Express Accessory,"We got this hand car along with the Polar Express train set. Like the others have said, the motion is jerky at best and the worst problem for me is that it travels at a different rate than the Polar Express engine. You can't run this on the same track as the Polar Express train because it will run into the back of that train. If you try to slow it down it won't move and the Polar Express train will hit it. I hope someone doesn't read all of these reviews and buys it from me off of Ebay!"
4,Magic furt,For afficionados only (as a second version)- Recording = *- Singers = *****- Music = ******12 stars / 3 = 4 starsFurt is Magic. I like this one very much. However the best i got is the Kemplerer's one (Lucia POPP is THE ULTIMATE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT according to my wife...).
5,A Beautiful Tenor Voice and Wonderful Songs,"Donald Kaasch has a voice that is one of the most mature and fearless on the market today. He is truly talented and is even more wonderful live in an opera or concert. These art songs are a wonderful showcase for a gentle side of this operatic star who tends to play masculine heros on stage. What a joy to listen to! Be sure to have plenty of tissue stocked, because this is full of emotion and beautiful poetry."
1,"How is ""Adolph"" a best baby name for a Jewish child??","I was considering purchasing this book for a friend as a baby shower gift. Luckily, Amazon.com has the wonderful ""look inside"" feature. When I did look inside, I was astonished to find ""Adolph"" on the list of masculine names. At that point this book has lost all credibility for me. I do not know of a single Jewish parent who would dare to name their child Adolph."
5,dubin does it again,awesome comp everyone. Mike dubin has managed to use his rockin list of friends and put together a very rocking cd. Props to mike and the fadeaway boys for putting out an awesome comp. I can only hope to come close on mine..www.closetonothing.com
4,Finally!!,"I've been waiting for Bob & Margaret to come out on DVD forever. Now that Season 1 is available, I guess we will just have to wait a few more years for the other seasons. What a shame? Love this show!!"
3,Bob and Margaret,"I don't think this is the complete first season like is advertised. I think the show had 13 episodes the first season, but this DVD only had 8 episodes..."
5,Gato Barbieri. a sax legend!!!,"This edition of two cs of the great legend of the ' 60s, the Argentinian Gato Barbieri saxophone, are formidable. Great remastering and especially hot interpretations of jazz fusion. Barbieri plays melodies with great passion and their sound and unmistakable style. Tremendous cd. Excellent delivery."
1,boo!,This album sucks major balls!! herm needs to stick to making compilations because his rapping sounds worse Than two guys fornicating!
4,Milwaukee 0824 Hammer Drill,"Very good performer. More torque than most jobs need. With Lithium cells battery never seems to run out of energy. Love the fact that you can use older ni-cads or newer Lithiums. Also reversable battery position gives you a nice choice for compact vs. balance. A little heavier than my older 12v, but handle helps with that."
5,Milwaukee 08-20 Lithium- Ion 1/2 inch Hammer Drill,This drill is a typical Milwaukee so far. If the job is easy it punches holes out quickly. Doesn't balk with more difficult jobs either. Anyone who purchases this drill motor will be most likely very happy with ainexpensive yet terrifically good tool. I would speak more highly but I need to use it more than I already have.
1,Arizona VHS movie,The worst copy I have ever seen. The movie was of very poor qualify; I stopped the movie after trying to watch it (it caused my eyes to strain) and threw it in the garbage.Ben Butler
1,A Book By Committee,"This book reminds me of a ransom note put together by cutting letters out of a magazine and gluing them on a piece of paper. It's a jumble and even the FBI would have difficulty discerning on whom to pin the blame.All the authors are supposedly pros and like professionals they hit all the correct buttons (plot, characters and action), and this book could have been a good action/thriller, but it missed on nearly all levels. A few years back a few computer programers were claiming that they could program a computer to write a novel, just enter the characters, plot, genre and voila, a novel. I'm sure it would have turned out a lot like this one.I would have simply chalked up the experience to wasting time on a mediocre, albeit readable, novel but the ending was so utterly inconclusive and limp that I put the book down feeling inexcusably cheated. Thence the single star."
1,art is lacked,"This is terrible. Unconvincing characters who speak only in cliches. Forced and boring action. Themeless and unstimulating. It's actually kinda funny, if you like bad writing - I laughed out loud a few times - but truly not worth your time."
1,What a disappointment,I had to search for this book after hearing about it and reading a glowing review. I couldn't wait to start it. But it was not worth my efforts. The characters are shallow and uninteresting. Their idea of a daredevil stunt is to swim from a ship to a dock with the possibility of a shark nearby. Big deal. And the artifact only appeared in a few pages at the beginning and end and had all the powers of a radish. What were the authors thinking?
4,Pulpy Goodness,"There are certain things I demand of my summer reading. I want it to take me places I haven't been before, introduce me to characters whose adventures I want to hear more of, and, last but not least, blow stuff up real good.Artifact does all this, and then some. Written by four excellent authors, it has the distinct feel of something that they all enjoyed writing. It's that kind of fast-paced fun, complete with a tough heroine, exotic locales, and an impromptu course in what to do if you get too close to a shark while scuba diving for pieces of an alien gizmo. (Hey, you never know)Artifact doesn't have a traditional slam-bang ending, which might confuse folks who are looking for something a little more Spielbergian, but the ending it does have satisfies and makes more character sense than any special effects extravaganza would have. That being said, there's still plenty of room for a sequel, and I definitely wouldn't mind learning what the Daredevil's Club does next."
5,Worked great,I purchased this for my father's truck and he had a very simple install with this kit! He was more than happy with it.
1,"Clear, solid textbook","This is a well informed and well written textbook presentation of standard metaphysical and epistemological problems from the standpoint of analytic philosophy. Its arguments are carefully spelled out and very clear, but Hume's writings are far more exciting than this book suggests."
3,Not for kids that can't read.,Only had it for a few days. The game is cute but would have been better if the dogs had voices.
3,Alot of reading,"My 6 year old likes this game, but there is one problem...there is too much reading. He cannot play this without someone to read the storyline and instructions to him. It wouldn't be so bad if it was just the story line that needed to be read, but without being able to read, he does not know what he is to do. This goes on throughout the entire game, not just at the beginning. Even for someone who can read, I think that there is entirely too much reading for a video game. It takes away from the game. The game is fun, but it's a game, it should have more playing time and less reading time. I bought a game, not a book."
4,great piece to add to your collection!,"The wok is very good for heat distribution which is really the whole reason to purchase a wok, so thumbs up for that. One thing I agree on from all the comments is that it is heavy so tossing vegetables is a challenge. It cleans up very nicely with the help of a little BAR KEEPERS FRIENDBar Keepers Friend Cookware Cleanser & Polish: 12 OZ. All in all a great piece to add to your collection!"
2,Not practical,"This pan is heavy and badly balanced, and the handle is extremely uncomfortable. With a pan this heavy you need a good handle; this one is narrow (ruins the balance) and has sharp edges that are unpleasant to grasp. The pan is far too heavy to let the cook manipulate and flip and toss food the way one should for a stir fry or saute. I also find the surface very hard to clean -- the slightest fond sticks more to the pan than the food. Mine has been soaking in my sink for 48 hours now after cooking a very basic stir fry and I still don't think I'm going to be able to get it looking clean again. This is my first piece of All-Clad and it's very disappointing."
1,Villeroy & Boch Home Elements Teapot Warmer,"The item was so poorly packaged, it arrived in a thousand pieces. Too bad. I returned the item and hope I receive my refund."
1,"fussy, verbose, unclear.","This book tries hard to be clear, exact, neat, unfortunately it fails badly.Tensors are ill-defined, theorems are ill-stated and their proofs are long, boring and tedious, if not simply wrong. For vector analysis one should stick to ""Vector Calculus""(J. Marsden and A. Tromba); for tensor analysis, let's read ""Tensor Analysis on Manifolds""(Bishop and Goldberg) or Spivak's ""A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry"", first volume."
3,Good for only one season,"I bought this decoy-koi in April or May, and by September it had faded noticeably. These are also quite fragile, and the fins will break off if dropped accidently in the kitchen sink during unpackaging (I speak from experience). The break was fairly clean, and superglue kept the broken appendage in place through the season. It needs to be cleaned of algae very regularly, and the surface is porous enough that the algae will always return once it is established. I have thrown it away, as I think it is not going to fool anybody anymore, as it did for the first month or so I had it."
4,"Sibelius from the ""Velvet Gloved Fingers of Steel""","Although dated in sound, these performances clearly reveal the Boston Symphony and their legendary conductor, Serge Koussevitsky, in stellar form. The interpretation of the Sibelius Second has few rivals, and the Fifth is also an eye opener. Likewise, the Seventh with the BBC Symphony is stunning in it's depth and intensity. Yes, there is some surface noise, and the sound is not the best. But for all it's dated recording flaws, the interpretations are among the very finest available anywhere. The other Sibelius ""bon-bon's"" on this recording only add to it's enjoyment. If you want to hear revalatory Sibelius, this set is well worth having. (The ""velvet gloved fingers of steel"" is a reference to the Koussevitsky/BSO's string section, quoted from Harry Elis Dickson's book on Koussevitsky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra entitled, ""Gentlemen, More Dolce, Please!"")"
1,Can't Finish What Was Started...,"In all fairness and in looking past the poor writing style, the book brought forth several good points, but failed to 'tie the knot' in bringing its readers to a sure conclusion that spirituality can be achieved by anyone. It was ""preachy"" yet informative. And like his other writing entitled, ""The End of the Age: A Prophetic View of Our Times"" the author took the opportunity to market his other books by by insisting his readers purchase them -- there could have been alternate methods to employ this without being so mandatory."
3,It's ok,"I can only listen to a couple of songs on this album. Not that it's a bad one, it's just that it's not my style of music."
3,What was all the fuss about?,I heard this album was supposed to be one of the best albums of the year. I just don't see it. I didn't like any of the songs except for Paper Planes.
2,Please enter a title for your review:,"People talk about M.I.A. being political but it's virtually impossible to make out a word she talk-sings. Most of her vocals are repetitive looped chants with a ridiculous level of reverb that drains all humanity out of her voice, and all these sparse percussive mid-tempo barely-songs sound the same. If you've heard half a song you've heard them all. I don't understand how anyone could endure the monotony of this record, let alone find anything to enjoy in it. It is somewhat original, but mostly for the fact that it sounds like someone let their kid loose in the recording studio."
5,disque,Parfait!!! neuf et pas chére envoie rapide livré en 8jours dans un trés bon emballage excellent je recommande ce vendeur .
2,Mostly Not Like Their Popular Song,"I remembered their most popular song (Paper Plates) from this album, found the whole album on sale as a download, and bought the whole thing. Aside from one other song (Jimmy), the album was mostly noise and chanting. Which some people may like, but now I understand the sale price. If you do want to try this album, sample the songs first."
5,Unique artist,"Mia is a very unique music aritst She experments with so many syles of music its awsome. I love this whole album, bamboo banga is a fun song, She is defintally not afraid to speak her mind And thats how we should all be .I love Mango Pickle Down River, ITs awsome beats, If i had to pic a song I love 20 Dollar I could listen to her every day everynight, all night long! Awsome"
4,Man who Knew?,"Mia's beats are good reminiscent of the 1980's and early 1990's is diffidently apart of the ""Look at Me"" generation thank goodness she has something worth listening to."
1,Big disappointment,"As a HUGE fan of Arular (it was probably my favorite recording of the last five years) I was really looking forward to Kala's release.Arular was a big, beautiful recording. It sounded like some demented Indian carnival. It held together perfectly.But Kala is like what happens after the carnival ends - all that's left is the racket of the roadies disassembling the tents. It's tuneless, hookless. Not one of the songs is better than any of the songs on Arular.My favorite song by far is the one produced by Timbaland, and although I like his production, I wish he didn't rap on it.MIA is a great artist, but she needs help production-wise."
1,m.i.a.,"i dont think there are any or enough drugs that could make me enjoy this disc. ""paper planes"" of course is a hit, but even that gets played out."
2,A lame sophomore album,"M.I.A.'s first album,Arular, was excellent. The beats on Kala are just as good as the last album, but M.I.A.'s lyrics are boring and uninspired."
2,Paper planes makes this CD buyable.,"Other then the song""Paper Planes"" I found nothing else on this CD that captured my listening ability. I found the rest of it a mish- mosh of noise and at times it got annoying."
1,It doesn't get much worse than this.,"Don't do it! Don't even think about it. The ""freshness"" wears off this CD in a matter of seconds. MIA's ""new sound"" comes across like a dying giraffe (on speed). There is a reason this thing is sold for under $6, because it is an absolute waste of your time to listen to it, and mine to even write about it! Please disappear into mediocrity, Ms. MIA, your 15 minutes are up. BTW, they made me give this album one star. When it doesn't even deserve that. Overrated. Over hyped. Over reviewed."
1,is this supposed to be good music? NO,"It's always great to find a great ""experimental"", ""ground breaking"", ""inspiring"" and ""imaginative"" album that stands out of the common and top 40 music. Examples of this kind of music they are many (thank God), but this album is NOT. It is dull, childish, REPETITIVE, PREDICTABLE, no hooks, no melody, no great beats. Don't believe the hype, this is not COOL MUSIC to show your friends, you will end with a headache. Save your money and look elsewhere."
2,eh... Too many inert ingredients. Clip seven track to make a decent EP...,"Overall, this is seriously bland. This album has few bright spots- the brightest of which, ""Paper Planes"", leaves all other tracks in the dust.This could've easily been a fairly solid EP of 5 tracks, but as a 12-track album, this is desperately lacking substance. Desperately. It appears as though she rushed this release to take advantage of the hype brought by her debut.Disappointing."
2,Deeply Saddened,"After all of the hype, rave reviews, and recommendations I heard about M.I.A., I figured I had to buy the album. I am definitely open to new and clever mixes, beats and the like but this album just did not do it for me. I have to say this was probably one of the most disappointing albums I have purchased in a while now. While I can definitely appreciate the attempt to incorporate sounds and beats that are not usually heard, I think the attempt turned into overkill. You know when you are reading an essay and the person who wrote the essay chops sentences up into fragments, misspells and leaves out punctuation? It's hard to read the essay without feeling like you're hitting a dip each time you come across an error. Same thing each time I heard a sound that clashed with another. The repetitiveness can drive you almost mad (e.g. Track 1). I am giving this CD two stars for two reasons: 1) Attempting to drive at something new, and 2) Track 2 (Jimmy). That's all I got."
2,"good, but overrated","This could be a fun upbeat lounge music in a club. It is not bad music after all. But after listening to this album several times, I am becoming more disappointed as it does not show a strong album personality, just a nice beat; so it appears bland after all. I am not trying to bias her fans but, at least, this could balance the rave reviews that, to me, was overrated."
3,"It's okay, BUT -","if you like this type of music then I think that you might like Crystal Castles better. I think the beats are much better, the vocals are more interesting and the creativity is just, overall, stronger.ALSO - CC is on a non-RIAA label. If that matters to you. It does to me."
2,Great only by terrible relativity,"2 1/2Sounds a little too tryingly innovative via exploiting various cultural elements. For mainstream club music it certainly is deserving, but as sheer music Kala is lacking, where these promising elements rarely come together to form a compelling whole, as evidenced by a select choice examples."
1,"yeah, no.","loved Arular, listened to it a hundred times easily. full of hooks and attitude, lots of energy, very original to my ears. This album feels like outtakes, or an imitator. I guess she believed the hype and lost her scruffiness. Don't believe me, listen to the samples here. The Timbaland track is ok, but I'm not going to play it again. the rest of it, totally forgettable."
4,Out of This World,"I love M.I.A. She experiments with music like a scientist does with lab rats. Crazy beats, untouchable energy I love it."
4,MIA's more creative side,"I really like Kala, and the more I listen to it, the more it grows on me. I feel each song has a unique, different flavor to it. It doesn't seem as forced as Arular. I enjoyed M.I.A.'s first album with it's poppy hits, but after a while it felt forced fed. With Kala, there's a smoother, more orchestrated effort by M.I.A. and guest vocalists. The beats are more soulful and hypnotic in their rhythms. And this album will make you move. Can't wait to hear the remixes on the dance floor, especially for 20 Dollar, XR2 and Hussel. Kala really showcases Maya as a creative artist rather than an overproduced number."
1,Works well if you can get the company to give you the product you ordered...,"Ordered two of these adapters and when my package arrived there was only one in the box. Since there is nothing in the item's options menu to handle this situation I had to spend time hunting down Amazon's customer service number. Then once I got hold of a representative I was told that they wouldn't be able to send me my other adapter so I'd be getting a refund. Waste of my time, should have just gone to the store for this."
4,The Second Version...,"Robin Gibb and Alistair Griffin's duet is a nice compliment to the Bee Gees version originally released in 1997. Other than being a distinctly different vocal sparring than Robin and Barry, the single does not enhance the mood of the original song all that much. It simply gives it more attention it deserves, as it is a well-crafted song. The history behind the recording being done without Barry's knowledge is worth the purchase alone. It was a questionable and pivotal point in Robin Gibbs recording career."
1,The Copied Country,Reading this Paul Twitchell book first written in 1970 and finding out that most of the work was copied from a book I read called Path of the Masters written in 1935 by Julian Johnson. I couldn't believe my own eyes. Paul Twitchell copied word for word from another book and started Eckankar and a group of his masters. Some time back I read the works of David Lane and Ford Johnson on this same subject on how Paul Twitchell copied books and started Eckankar from other writers.
4,"if you loved hart to hart, you'll love this","this movie has all the witty remarks and good scripting that made all of us love hart to hart. not to mention the ability to look at rj!! and lesley-anne plays this to a t. I fell in love with this movie when it was released and now I own a copy. I am very pleased and have watched it over, and over, and over."
4,"Too much drama, not enough comedy this go round","I'm a huge fan of Boston Legal. It's about the only show I really enjoy. This season was good, but it lacked a lot of the humor that was found in the other seasons, humor that balances the show out and just barely keeps it from being a ""drama"".Good, but not *as* good."
3,one season too far,"This season was not as captivating as the prior seasons, Running out of steamsomethings aren't funny...this is it, dark"
3,This season was so-so...,"I own all 3 DVD sets of this show. It's my favorite. However, the production effort of season 4 has noticeably declined. There are still some strong, funny moments, but they're fewer and farther between than in the 3rd season, and there isn't much in there to fill some gaps (Less music, maybe?). Comedic timing seems to be off a bit, camera angles less interesting, and makep makes everyone look too pale most of the time. The lack of Brad and Denise is very apparent, although the new people are interesting, but not particularly funny.There's still some magic left, but it's obvious they're spending less on the show to produce, leaving me, the die-hard BL fan to long for the good old days.....Buy it if you're still hooked, but I'd start with an earlier season if you've never seen the show."
4,Great show,I really like this show.If they had not made William Shatner to be such a moron I would love this show.He was great in the first season.
2,Boston Legal Season Last...?,Looks like the writers are about out of ideas...I'd guess one more season and this series loses viewer interest...the biting panache of the first season or two has dwindled down into the mindless drivel of a daytime soap opera...with a very slightly legal overtone.
1,Fools' Lib Agenda,Could have been acceptable w/o the Liberal Agenda Hype.Give me a break. Give everybody a break!I will not watch any more of this trash.
2,Missing a disc,"We love the series but the ""new"" dvd set I purchased is missing disc #1. Not sure what I can do about that."
2,It's getting old and tired,"I have bought the first 3 seasons and I have really enjoyed them although I have tended to ignore the silly liberal rants because they didn't seem so bad, plus the acting, stories trumped over the rants. But holy cow this season, maybe because of the same old tired liberal dribble by our low life politicians, I just can't seem to get into the episodes. I even have to mute the long-winded speeches by Alan now, I use to love the guy. This time though, there are blatant lies by the characters which reflect the lies we are being told by our liberal friends. I highly recommend this product to those liberals who don't like America, you will love this, it will satisfy your inner hate."
1,Unwatchable smug preaching,"I really enjoyed the first three seasons of Boston Legal. But season four is a great disappointment. Instead of humor we are subjected to constant left-wing preaching in a heavy-handed almost Stalinist format. The humor is almost non-existent as the story line has Alan Shore doing nothing attacking anything having to do with traditional values...and it is always the fault of the evil republicans. The only funny show was the one dealing with Denny's arrest for soliciting for male sex... There might be more funny shows but I stopped watching it after the tenth show in which they bash the National Guard. Members of the National Guard not only risk their lives for us, but have also made enormous personal and financial sacrifices."
5,Great fun!,"I have yet to watch an episode of Boston Legal that I did not thoroughly enjoy, and this season is no exception!"
5,love this show,"boston legal is one of the funniest, yet serious, shows out there -- each season just gets better -- wish we had a real law firm like this near our hometown!!!"
5,Denny Crain - Need I say more?,"The adventures of Denny Crain and Alan Shore, along with a changing support cast make for interesting viewing while employing the David E. Kelly skewering of modern life."
5,Love this series,"My husband and I are both addicted to the antics of James Spader, William Shatner and the rest of this kooky cast."
5,How did we miss these?,"""Boston Legal' came and went from its original broadcasts without our knowing about it. We just happened to catch a few re-runs and have become addicted. This is a great series, and though I wish it was still being produced, it may have run just long enough that it didn't become boring, predictable and missable. James Spader and William Shatner are fantastic...other actors are cropping up in other programs now and continue to seem like old friends."
1,very disappointed,"i purchased boston legal season 4 initially as a set of four (seasons 1 thru 4). i watched seasons 1 thru 3 each set of discs were fine. when i inserted season 4 i received error nessage saying ""disc not formatted for my region."" long story short back and forth with 3 replacement discs for season 4 each time amazon customer service told me they had problem solved. they never solved problem iust kept sending me ""disc not formatted for my region."" i finally sent every disc back and had them give me a credit. then they tried to stick me for a restocking fee which i argued over and they eventually returned to me. not my fault their disc didn't work. i liked doing business with amazon but found out when there is a problem they just can't get it straightened out. it seems they have a lack of communication within their organazation."
4,Basic But Fair Introduction to Hop Gar Lama Gung Fu,"First of a two-volume series by Michael Staples on Northern Chinese Gung Fu. This is one of the rare Tibetan Lama styles of boxing contained in Hop Gar system. This book contains a lot of history and explains many of the popular legends of Kung fu, including the Legend of the Eighteen Buddhas (Arhants). Numerous pictures and drawings throughout.Northern boxing tends to have bigger movements, not as compact as say, Wing Chun. There is good reason to believe this is related to the inclusion of Chin-na, or seizing and grappling techniques contained in the forms.Instruction on footwork and stepping, Chinese Medicine, Chi, and a Tibeten Kung Fu form in Chapter 5 demonstrating the Lama Horse riding stance set. At the back of the book is a Glossary and an appendix explaining the ranking system in chinese kung fu. This book is followed by a second volume called Hop-Gar Kung Fu, by the same author."
4,Anything But Agony,"I'd heard of New York's Life Of Agony, but hadn't actaully heard their soul crunching music until recently. Turns out, I was missing a very potent blend of heavy riffs and heartfelt vocals that gets better every listen. These guys were and probably still are a huge underground band. Songs like the chugging and aptly titled ""Underground"" and the ripping ""Bad Seed"" show not only early C.O.C. and Anthrax type riffs, but adding melodicism to go with it. In no way do Keith Kaputo's mellow contributions ""My Mind...."" and ""Angry Tree"" sound any less important than the groove of ""Here I Am."" In short, a great CD from start to finish. Don't be left out."
4,kick ass band,"i got this cd after seeing the band live, which i must say took me by surprise after not even really listenin to these guys...they put on one of the best shows i ever saw...if u like heavy guitar then this band is for you, the vocals are unique and they carry that heavy metal sound that i love...much respect for the live show and i hope to see them again...one of the best metal cd's ever..."
4,why we need this,"OK - leprechaun40 from rahway, nj USA states that ""Best of/ Greatest hits albums are never endorsed by the band."" Alan robert (bass - songwriter) did this Best Of cover. ""Generally these albums are used to fulfill a contract and the band sees no royalties from any greatest hits or best of albums."" Yes, bands sometimes need to fullfil contractual obligations with a GH album but they most certainly see royalties on these releases. Look at your local record store ... if these stores stocked all of LOA's titles you wouldn't need this Best Of. But because they don't - LOA need this record out there. And this is a good one!"
1,Not Sponsored By LOA,"do NOT buy this,This CD was not endorsed by the band members. They are no longer on this record company. This is just an example of Corporate america trying to ca$h in. Wait for the RRAgain (this is directly sponsored by the band)"
3,Half decent overview of an underrated band,"While Life of Agony managed to find some success with their Roadrunner Records debut ""River Runs Red"" in 1993, nothing the band ever came up with since could hold a candle to their great debut. ""The Best of Life of Agony"", much like Roadrunner's other ""Best Of"" compilations, is a solid introduction to the band for new listeners, but offers completely nothing new to veteran fans. Just about everything a Life of Agony fan would expect to be on a ""Best Of"" is here, including ""This Time"", ""River Runs Red"", ""Underground"", ""Bad Seed"", ""Through and Through"", ""Lost at 22"", and ""My Mind is Dangerous"", along with some solo work by frontman Keith Caputo. All in all, while this is a solid introduction for new listeners, they may be better off checking out ""River Runs Red"" first, and for the rest of us, this is better left on the shelf."
5,A Royal Treasure,This is a treasure for any royal enthusiast. There are plenty of photos of not just Queen Victoria as well as various members of her extended family and descendants. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in European royal history.
4,100 years of royal photographs,"The key to this book is actually in it's subtitle : 100 years of royal photography. It is heavy in photographs of Queen Victoria's family and her descendants. It deals not only with her children, but their children and grandchildren.The pictures in this book are all of good quality, and some are not commonly seen on books on English royalty. Each photograph has a little story attched giving you some information on the person in the picture and something about what path their life took. There is some intersting information and suprises in these little stories.The photos are divided into both private and public, so you get a mixture of family photos and some of royalty dressed to the hilt in jewels to die for.An interesting, but slightly dissapointing book, as I would have loved to see more 19th century photos and maybe a greater range of formal pictures."
2,Ph booster drops are minimal help,"Being a water specialist, Drops only help with stomach PH. Understand that you need to have the majority of your diet in the 8ph - 9PH range. Look into water ionizers and see they offer high PH, restructured water and high antioxidant ( -ORP ) benefits. Look at [...] for info or questions."
2,dated book about adoption,"I got this book to share with my children, but having read it I won't be doing so. Though our family is Christian, this book is far too fundamentalist. That in itself could be fine for some families, but I find some of the language about adoption dated, offensive, and potentially difficult for children who have been adopted. The term ""natural"" parents is unfortunately used. There are also lines such as ""I try to show Jesus how happy I am for giving me my mom and dad by obeying them,"" and (in a prayer) ""Help me to show my parents how much I love them for wanting me."" My concern is that reading those to my children would send them a message that they should be grateful for us having adopted them. I do not consider this a suitable book about adoption."
1,Quite possibly the worst children's adoption book EVER,Please do your children (or future children) a favor and do NOT buy this book. I doubt the author ever even knew an adoptee.
1,Adopted and Loved Forever,"As a student of world religions and having adopted interracially, I will not use this book about adoption with our child. The Christian overtone is strong, without discussion on acceptance of different families let alone religions. As a parent who would like to pass on the acceptance of all peoples, cultures and religions as different, not right or wrong, I would not recommend this book. A good alternative would be ""Families are Different""."
3,Not as helpful as I'd wished,"It's good for what it DOES--business and social manners in the countries that it covers. But the two countries I had wished to investigate--the Dominican Republic and Honduras--are not covered at all. Quite a disappointment. I suppose because these are the two most impoverished countries in the hemisphere, one might think that Americans aren't that interested in traveling there. Quite the contrary. Many American churches send mission groups there, and we need desperately to be aware and sensitive to the customs and manners of the other Christians we desire to fellowship with and serve. It would have been very nice to have a resource that included these two countries. I guess we'll have to look elsewhere."
5,simple prolonged exposure will yield pleasurable results,"it's sort of the theme the Walkmen themselves use when constructing their riffs - take a chord play it for many measures - but noodle with it a bit - add sixths or 11ths or whatever - and then while the pounding is just getting hypnotic switch to a relative minor.OR something -But, it sounds great!I'm not sure about the Lost In Boston song - and all in all, I think this is the weakest of their powerful records (but perhaps more accessible for the first time listener).funny story, they were touring with Mazarin last year - and just as Mazarin was wrapping up and I was wondering if I was listening to the Walkmen already (I never check band sites to get an idea of what the members look like, if I had I'd have known quickly) - they left stage and the walkmen came out and I felt pretty silly.ON this record they COVER a Mazarin tune just to keep the confusion flowing!Great stuff - that threatens to infuse into TOO MANY bands."
2,A Hundred Keys Off,"Oh man is this CD annoying. This dude's voice is absolutely unbearable. If Bob Dylan dies and returns as a ghost, this is what he will sound like when he's haunting your house. I guess musically it could be worse but it's still pretty unlistenable as long as you're a fan of music that is pleasant to the ears in even the slightest way."
3,"Yes, this is a departure","This album is very different from the band's first two. Pianos and organs still linger here and there, but they are not as prominently featured in these songs which are basically guitar-driven rock songs. Hamilton Leithauser's once incredible voice has morphed into a shirll screech lacking enunciation for many of the tracks. It's a pleasant break when he explores his lower range on ""Brandy Alexander"". I've heard Dylan comparisons, but maybe it's closer to Faces-era Rod Stewart. ""Lousiana"" ""All Hands and the Cook"" ""Brandy Alexander"" and especially ""Another One Goes By"" are excellent. A couple more tracks like these and this album could have been great. Overall, it's not as good as ""Bows + Arrows"" or ""Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me is Gone"" but not as bad as some critics have claimed. I'd give it a B (I'm a teacher)."
1,"Confused, directionless and fabricated","The book is a list of lists. Basically whatever the author had lying around was thrown in.Some of the ""ancient stories"" which the author are uses are largely fabricated. The Liu Bang/Xiang Yu story in particular bears no relation to actual historical events beyond the names of the participants. A fictional story in support of the author's points masquerading as actual history.Author has a bad tendency to wax lyrical.The claim on the cover of ""International Bestseller"" is probably wishful thinking. Amazon sales rank is a better indicator of popularity than dubious unverifiable claims from publishers."
2,"Not sure if this is art, or simply artistic tourment","A true example of musical fragmentation. You may find this interesting, if you can keep the headphones on. It's constantly on the edge of structure, but just never, ever quite arrives--ever. You find yourself seeking it and craving it after just a few tracks. It is utterly menacing and tormenting, and even more so when you recognize one of the sampled clips and are familiar with the structure in it. On the other hand, if you're looking for menace and torment, then this is the disc for you."
4,The Art of Noise,"This production by Terre Thaemlitz is either an outstanding work of avant-garde art or a romp into the theatre of the absurd, with the joke on the listener. There seems to be a mix of both extremes in the 31 tracks that rumble in at nearly 57 minutes.In short bursts, the sounds of silence, drones, music from a variety of genres, the blather of TV talk show hosts and some disturbing conversations are sped up, slowed down, turned around and sometimes played back normally. The volume flows from being minimally heard to bursting out, seemingly poised to engulf anything in its way.In the quest to seemingly ""honor"" the art of daily (mindless) noise in the soundtrack of life, Thaemlitz ultimately stuffs pop culture into a barrel and tosses it down the Horseshoe Falls at Niagara Falls......and walks away, not looking back."
2,its a good cd if you like bay area Rap,I personally didnt like the cd cause it only had one 2Pac song on it and i dont like too much bay are Rap so i sold it. if you like bay area Rap then pick the cd up but if you a eastcoast head then leave it on the shelf to collect dust cause its st8 wack
2,"He has much, much better","I love his stuff, new and old. But this work went off on tangents. Stories shared I didn't find spiritually relevent or enlightening. This author is great but get his other titles."
2,"Love Dr. Dyer - This Audio Book, Not So Much","I've read a couple of Dr. Dyer's books and loved them! They helped me SO much! I also downloaded from Itunes a couple of his podcasts...for only .95 cents. This $18.00 CD repeats a lot of what those .95 cent podcasts have on them. Given that money is tight for me right now since I'm not working, I was disappointed that this CD was pretty much a more expensive version of what I'd already heard. However, toward the end of the CD, when he gets more to the whole point, the ""pathways"", there are some helpful insights. I was expecting much more from this CD set and I am somewhat disappointed by the content. I'm still a big fan of his though!"
4,"if you love cars, you will love this movie","i love this movie, i could watch it every day, its not all that funny, but if you love cars, chicks, and car chases, this is what you are looking for"
2,"No better than Who's Harry Crumb, Candy's last movie. The Smothers Bros. really are awful!","Good roles for some in here, like BrookShields, and other cameos. But EugeneLevy comes off like a used snake oilsalesman! I was actually glad Candypunched him at the end. Jamie Farr(M*A*S*H*) reprises his CannonballRun role(s) here! But there have beentoo many 'Race Across the States' typemovies already. Burt Reynolds did thesebest!"
1,"It so bad, its worth watching!","This film is ... . Full stop. It is so bad in fact that its worth watching. The plot has loop holes in it so big, that a 747 could fly through them. For example - A car has the ability to skip over water!, or the Jaguar XJS which passes out a Contach in a straight line in a race - yeah right. Or how about the plane used in the film with a (unreal) engine added on to the fuselage - why?. As a fan of truely great films (The Godfather,Casino, Terminator etc...), the film ranks as possibly the worst film I have ever seen. However I did end up watching the whole thing!"
5,Hammering Hank NAILS It,"I challenge even the most dedicated fan of 1960s and 70s baseball and Hank Aaron to read this book and not come away with an entirely new appreciation for the times that Hank had to endure while he was shattering baseball's most revered record. Mssrs. Kennedy and Stewart have crafted a thoroughly researched and wonderfully written book that baseball fans, especially Hank Aaron fans, will enjoy and refer back to.A master work."
4,STILL IS THE HOMERUN KING,A LIKED THIS BOOK BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT SKIMPY ON THE CONTENT. I JUST THOUGHT THAT THE AUTHOR COULD HAVE ADDED MUCH MORE TO THIS BOOK ABOUT HANK'S CAREER. THE PART ABOUT HANK'S 715 TH HOMERUN WAS WELL DONE BUT HE SEEMED TO RACE THROUGH HIS CAREER AND WAS A BIT SKIMPY ON THE DETAILS. BUT OVERALL I DID LIKE IT. NOT MUCH IS MENTIONED ABOUT HANK'S FAMILY AFTER HE WAS MARRIED. BUT HIS CHILDHOOD IS WELL COVERED. JUST MY OPINION BUT TO ME HE IS STILL NUMBER 1 ON THE ALL TIME LIST. BONDS USED STEROIDS AND HIS RECORD IS TARNISED ALONG WITH HIS CAREER. FANS OF HANK WILL LIKE THIS BOOK BUT AARON'S BOOK I HAD A HAMMER IS BETTER.
4,Smokin' Smokin' Smokin',"Ahhh, I ordinarily don't smoke, but after purchasing this CD, I found a trail of smoke everywhere I played it. In the house, in the car, on the job :-). The CMB and guest were serving up some serious Tonic on this live masterpiece. I love the variety and the originality and the imagination showcased in this project. The genius even in the mistakes depicts the deft of these artists. This is a wonderful experience. You have to try it to believe it."
4,Ray Brown's Reincarnation,"Solid stuff. 3 Discs. The first is made up of the best tunes from the first set of both nights of this two night run at Tonic. Very nice. McBride's technical skills are amazing. The second two discs are basically jam sessions, the second set of each night, with special guests like Charlie Hunter and DJ Logic. It's cool to hear these guys jam, but since it's totally improv, the second two discs are made up of 15-20 minute jams based around one tonal center = a lot of cool licks and skills but the music doesn't really go anywhere. Everyone playing at this show is a fantastic musician, though especially CM."
3,2/3 Great,"Excellent! So what holds me back? Disc 3. Of course, that's subjective. A great price for 3 CD's."
1,Unanswerd Questions,"If you like having plot holes filled and questions answered than you need to avoid this anime like it is the plague. Though the animation is beautiful, the soundtrack is enjoyable, and the characters are engaging, this anime falls very short on the ""understandability"" factor. The plot is, at best, sketchy, with very important details being omitted (such as why the world is the way it is or why the girl is as she is). At the end of the series you will be saying ""wow, what a neat ending, but nothing made sense""! For true hardcore anime fans I offer this analogy: Evangelion had more continuity and made better sense at the conclusion than does Last Exile."
2,Fails to Engage the Viewer,"Firstly, this show has beautiful visuals. I don't think anyone can refute that. Unfortunately, joining them are flat, two-dimensional characters and a dull storyline. If you just want something pretty to look at, I suppose you could do worse. However, if you're looking for an engrossing storyline and interesting characters you will care about then you should look elsewhere."
4,i wish i understood the cover,"Mellow but very pretty late-period Hollies, typically glorious harmony vocals and a few nice Terry Sylvester solos. I especially enjoy ""What Am I Gonna Do"" and ""Hello To Romance"" (Goodbye to those one night stands). ""Boulder To Birmingham"" is a nice bluesy ballad, reminiscent of ""Gasoline Alley Bred"". ""Caracas"" is flavored by latin jazz, and the car song ""Burn Out"" is the closest thing to a real rocker. This album is not as dated as those that came after. The Hollies were just elected into the Hall of Fame, and it's about time!"
5,Between the Rivers,The story of Maggie Lorena will keep the reader spellbound throughout the entire book. This is Carolyn Booth's first novel and I look forward to more of her novels. ...
2,Too low density of information,"The informational density in this book is too low.The book provides good description of compression techniques and algorithms, however, compared to the number of pages, the amount of information provided is not adequate.The book is full of program listings in both BASIC and C, together with a description of what this code does. This I consider unnecessary.Also, the book is dangerously inaccurate in many places, even in algorithm specifications, formulations are often so inaccurate, that they can be even considered misleading.However, if you are a carefull and aware reader, you can harvest the compression algorithms out of this book."
4,UNDERSTANDING YOU,"OUT OF YOUR FIVE SENSES, IF YOU HAD TO LOSE ONE, WHICH ONE WOULD IT BE? READING THIS BOOK GAVE ME A NEW OUTLOOK ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ALL OF ME, AND HOW ALL OF ME WORK TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD OF ALL OF ME."
4,"This is a factual documentary, not a feature film!","I think you miss the point Richard (see previous review). ""From Hell"" starring Johnny Depp was a work of fiction based on a graphic novel of the same name. The basis of the plot is the much debated freemason/royal family cover up, and is still a highly regarded solution to the case, despite what other historians and ripperologists say. It was inspired by Stephen Knight's book, Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution, as was the earlier movie ""Murder By Decree"" (1978). Stephen Knight's theories are compelling and well researched and presented in his book as the facts of the case, as he sees them. In the video he talks about his studies and it's simply a documentary about Knight and his conclusions. Whether you disagree with Knight is another matter entirely but you cannot compare this documentary with the many fictional accounts about Jack the Ripper. I wonder if you actually watched this video before you left a review?"
3,Not bad but 'From...,"Hell', the Johnny Depp vehicle is better.It really doens't bring up the Masonicconnection and doesn't really answerthe 'Who Done It?' aspect of the casevery completely. Six others out thereon same subject but this, unfortunatelyis the best besides 'From Hell'. Sad..."
1,Very disappointing children's book,"Donald the Dormouse ""Why We Have Rainbows"" is a major disappointment. The text is very poorly written, contains several typos and just doesn't make sense. In fact, it reads so badly that I get the impression it's actually a substandard translation from another language. Example: ""The teacher asked the children to help her clear up.""I'm also unhappy with the seller, testbooksrus.com, because they've not responded to my e-mail as I attempt to get a refund. With so many wonderful children's books available, this book is not worth a penny.Thank you."
2,Not worth the price,"This rice cooker is one of the crappiest I've seen. As the previous review states, rice always sticks to the bottom and turns yellow. On top of that, It sprays watery goo everywhere through the vent in the cover. Even after following the directions to a T (and making some adjustments of my own to try to fix the issue), I still end up with a sticky counter. I ended up just going back to a regular pot again. Definitely a waste of money."
2,Crappy Rice Cooker,"I have a large Wolfgang Puck rice cooker which is excellent, with a non stick pan. I decided to get a smaller rice cooker and ended up with this. As stated previously, the pan is not non stick, so the rice sticks and I had to scrape it off, which scratched the pan. Buy a better rice cooker with a non stick pan."
1,Piece of Crap!,I bought this because I had heard that rice cookers were the best way to cook rice. That may be true..But if you like a hell of a time cleaning up the burned/stuck rice on the bottom then this is the rice cooker for you.Definitely not my mothers Farberware!
4,Good Info but---,"I think that you should get the original SAS survival book. This book is good with the info it has but it is NOT geared to wilderness survival. I know the title says Urban and that is what it deals with. Good section on Emergency Preparations.Good for a city slicker type family.Lofty knows his stuff.Reason for 4 stars was I thought it lacked more of the ""meat"""
5,A all round book the best survival book,It's the best survival hand book to me it goes beyond what you will expect it's packed with information on almost everything and it's so easy to understand it's a boss of a book the real deal. from TREVOR in TRINIDAD & TOBAGO. bless
1,Going straight to the Goodwill drop box.,"This was such a let down. I can't understand why anyone would give this book five stars. This really has nothing to do with survival. I read the description and table of contents before buying, which lead me to believe that this book would offer practical advice for living in the city when things get dangerous. It does not. This is only a book for a person without common sense advising how to live within a normal day without killing or maiming yourself with your own stupidity. The best information was the section on first aid. However, if you ever took a babysitting course or did any sort of boy scouts or girl scouts, you already know more than what is in this book."
2,Hollow nonsense,"The information provided is at best, at a third grade knowledge level and the safety advice is given as if the ridiculous warning labels from every consumer product have been combined.Contains NO USEFUL information whatsoever.I threw the book away. I used it to mash my trash down into my trash can (that was the most use I got from it)."
1,This book was NOT what I thought it would be!,"I had very high hopes for this book, and sad to say it didn't fulfill any of them. After wading through the tiring--and completely discredited--global warming discussion, he proceeds to discuss various kinds of everyday threats to our lives. I was unaware that, because I wear contacts, it is dangerous for me to view a computer monitor for more than an hour at a time (p. 311). I also was stunned to see that my posture in my work chair was poor, and page 311-312 tells me how to correct that. HUH?!?!? I wanted to read about urban survival skills, not mamby pamby stuff like work posture or monitor screens.This is the first book I have EVER returned to Amazon, but I am going to return it. It is a total waste of money. And I had such high hopes for the book. Please, carefully look at the reviews before plunking down your money. I wanted to like this book, but it was impossible to do so."
4,Puts the Boy Scout Manual to Shame,"Well written and nicely illustrated, this book is a quality work. Yes,even a serious approach to survival in any environment - except urban and suburban environments. I am impressed. Using the suggestions contained could be life saving for people lost in wild environments. And I think hard core survivalists will treasure this book."
2,SAS Urban Survival Short term.....,"This was disappointing for me because I expected more. Urban survival is long term in crisis not just 3 days in some instances; consider New Orleans after Katrina. I have the SAS Survival Manual to use as I will need it to vacate the city shortly there after. I would like the book to have more about securing food, water, shelter out of what you are left with in your neighborhood when there is a disaster. Like dangers to look out for, safety, security, avoiding pillagers and mobs, what and where to stockpile 6 months worth of food etc. I think this is Survival/crisis lite!"
2,"Not as much fun as the ""SAS survival guide""","Maybe I was expecting too much after reading the ""SAS survival guide"".There is a lot of usefull information in this book, but don't expect to find as many clever tricks or knowledge as in the original."
1,"Buy SAS Survival Handbook, dont buy SAS Urban Survival Handbook","First off I loved SAS Survival Handbook. Now about SAS Urban Survival Handbook, Do not buy it. I may be wrong if your primary concern when the ""SHTF"" is lead paint poisoning(pg.149). A large hurricane is heading your way and for what ever reason you have to stay, how concerned are you about the dangers of contact sports(pg.339)? When your neighborhood loses power and will have none for a week or more, if your primary concern is renting power equipment (pg.138) then I am wrong. Look, this is not a survival handbook. It is a Everything is normal choose a safe play ground(pg.324) hand book. I can go on and on but this is the point, This book will find its way in my camp fire to keep my family and I warm before it finds it way in my bug out bag. If I could return this I would. With this I still say the SAS Survival Handbook is always in my ""EDC"" bag."
4,Chair Exercises for Seniors,"This program is challenging, a good workout, and has the flexibility to improve the workout with heavier weights and still keep up."
2,exercise for disabilities,"This is not a great product, I know the man tried hard to convey to people with disabilities that this would help them. But he spoke in a monotone, so did not display much energy. I guess it was ok maybe for people who are not on the same disabled level as I am."
1,Not a good choice for women.,I regret this purchase. There is one person shown doing the exercises. I have found it easier to follow group movements. The type of chair he is using with arms is not very common for most of my friends. Finally I could not get pass Bob Klein's legs in the short pants.
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,This is a great work-out for seniors and others who have trouble withconventional exercise programs!
3,Video,Shipping was slower than anticipated. I purchased this as a gift for my 78 year old Dad. I don't know his feedback yet so can't comment any further.
5,helps sciatica pain,"I have arthritis and sciatica and found these exercises make me feel better. When I first did them, I thought some would cause me pain later but it was the exact opposite -- they reduced pain. Great stretching exercises."
2,Video of chair exersizes for seniors,I was very disappointed with the video. The man doing the demo and dialog is so distracting that I was unable to follow. I couldn't even watch the entire video. It's a lot of money to sit on my shelf!
5,Highly Recommended !,"Business schools and shareholders focus so relentlessly on hard numbers and cold facts that it's no surprise that data reigns supreme in the corporate world. But executives who downplay the importance of emotion and intuition do so at their own peril, management expert Manfred Kets de Vries convincingly argues. He offers a wealth of useful tips for leaders who are ready to reintroduce the human side, the soft side, to their organizations and their own lives. The author occasionally drops in stories and quotes from his clients, but his argument would have been bolstered by even more examples. We recommend this easy-to-digest volume to leaders who want to improve their interpersonal skills."
5,Wonderful Anime Movie,"timeless, classic, I loved this movie when I was a kid and still loving it, Dogs are supposed to be loved, not worked to death, my girl pomeranian sleeps on my pillow with me, I love you Buck.....enjoy your new life of freedom................."
5,great song book!,I received the song book fast and in great shape. Love the way the guitar cords are easy and pleasant to listen too. I bought the book for my husbands birthday to go with his new 12 string guitar.
2,Boooo,"Just move along folks. This ""selections"" CD has a few of the good songs from the movie, but is missing soooo many. Boooo."
3,Vector Victorious...,"With the name Hoffmann Banesh, this book need no review. He is the author of many wonderful mathematics books which include illustration. As the old saying ""a picture worth a thousand words"", this book use picture to solve the mysterious of vector which is so complex. It will help you gain a better understanding of vector if you're taking Physics or Vector Analysis class."
4,Two different 112's,"Note: There is a Deluxe 112, and a Princeton 112.I ordered through Amazon, and got the Princeton 112 cover which won't fit my amp.Musician's Friend was absolutely fantastic with customer service, and is sending a new one FREE! Without my returning the old one.The problem with any of these covers is they fit many different amps. So, I have a Deluxe 90 which should use a Deluxe 112 cover, which also fits others as well.See the potential problem? They all look the same on the shelf.I can't say enough about Musician's Friend, though. I've bought as bunch of stuff from them, and they ship fast, and have the best price. Now, their customer service has been tested too!The quality is good, so when I get the right one, I'll be happy."
2,Absolutely Unimpressive Recycled Product,"Recycled, unimaginative, simply a book report on the so-called, sometimes far-fetched, fabricated laws of business or life.In order to make up 100 laws of business, and package it nicely in a book for marketing reasons , Brian Tracy recycled a lot of his old stuff based on his previous books and audio programs.Actually, this is more like a product than a book, since the last part of the book is hard-selling on Brian Tracy's company, training services and previous products.Since readers are becoming smarter these days, and know most of the marketing or line extensions tricks of the so-called money- grabbing personal development gurus, I think they will definitely doubt about the sincereity of Brian Tracy's products.Readers are not dumb or blind to commercial motives these days."
2,Unfortunately Ordinary,"My book club read this, and there was a concensus that McPhee'w writing style is great. She kept the story moving, uses language well, and has a engaging style. Unfortunately, the characters in her book are so unlikeable that it really detracts from her writing style. Lillian is highly unlikeable and McPhee falls short in her attempts to make her appear more human and maternal. The book mimics a soap opera and there were a few funny moments in the book, but unfortunately this book is lacking good depth of the characters. They are stagnant and I agree with another reviewer stiff. If you want to read it, try to borrow it or get it from the library. It's not a book you would read again."
2,Not that great,"I seem to be the only reviewer who is not totally enthralled with this book. I found the plot to be very plodding, and I thought the characters were unbelievably stiff. Lillian seemed, although very erudite, to be very unlikeable from her childhood until she herself became a mother. The sisters' relationship was stilted, the ""romance"" was pedestrian and boring. I was left wondering what I'd missed. I found myself checking to see how many more pages were left throughout my reading of ""No Ordinary Matter."" I have always liked McPhee's books, which is why I stuck with it, but not this one."
3,Great Pictures,Enjoyed the book. Wish there was more story line about the area and the people. The pictures were great. Brought back many memories.
3,"If you've been waiting for a new 16 volt, then this isn't it","Recently I went to [a 16volt website], and i was thrilled to see that there was a new cd out. Ever since Supercoolnothing, I've been a hardcore 16 volt fan---one of my very elitest fav bands.But unfortunately, we'll just have to keep waiting. This is just a compilation of rough unpolished works. It can be compared to a special features section on a dvd, but I wouldn't give it any more than that. Nice to have, but you won't find yourself listening to it nonstop like the other 16 volt cds.(...)Nevertheless, this guy rocks, so check out his other albums, especially Supercoolnothing and Wisdom."
5,Smooth Acid Jazz Shines On,"Shakatak is not everybody's bag, but if you're on this page you were at least curious. That's all it should take. This is a fantastic CD front to back with catchy tunes and a great style. One of my top CD's of the year."
2,Kind of a stinker...,"...classic first-novel claptrap, overstuffed with heavy-handed plot developments and ham-fisted sex scenes, fronted by a character who is quite obviously the author himself (or the man he wishes he were), endowed with super-human properties as a ballplayer, a gumshoe, and (most riotously) a lover. Laughably entertaining, a la ""Troll 2,"" perhaps, hence the extra star."
5,"Catholicism, Baseball and Murder-- Elias Hits a Homerun!","Having been a fan of Rob Elias's non-fiction works, I was eager to see how he would fare in his initial foray into the world of murder mystery novels. Set in and about the San Francisco Bay area, from the first chapter on it is clear that Professor Elias and his protagonist Debs Kafka have hit a homerun. This whodunit has something for everyone- religion (specifically Catholicism), baseball, and higher education. Could anything be more timely? The result is a wonderfully engrosssing story that keeps the reader guessing throughout and has a climax that will literally blow you away. Let's hope that the bookcover's notation that this is a ""Debs Kafka Mystery"" means that we can look forward to more from Mssrs. Elias and Kafka in the future."
2,Historically Inacurate And Poorly Crafted Video,"While the historical narrative accompanying this video is essentially correct, the historical reenactments are laughable. The actor -- if we can even call him that -- who portrays Alexander struts around like Fabio posing for the cover of some romance novel. The extras who portray Alexander's army rush into battle like drunken frat boys and clearly were not coached in the intricacies of Phalanx warfare. Worst of all, Alexander and his cavalrymen ride horses with stirrups! Stirrups were a medieval invention that didn't show up until more than 500 years after Alexander's death.If you want to view a good video on Alexander, this isn't the place to look."
1,It is barely worth taping over this,"This video, and most of the series that accompanies it, is extremely sappy. It is just a shade better than what you'd expect from an 10 year old (with an eight millimeter camera)!!Don't waste your money...and if you get it for free, tape over it... it isn't even woth the time to watch it! There are a couple others that you'd be much happier with."
1,not worth the price,"I would actually give it a zero .. and would REALLY REALLY like a refund. The wavy lines at the top and bottom make it look like a 16mm film from 30+ years ago that was burned onto a DVD. It was VERY short and VERY poor quality. Two WONDERFUL DVDs I did order around the same time were VISIONS of ENGLAND and VISIONS of ITALY. These were cheaper, longer and EXCELLENT quality DVDs. (Unfortunately, Amazon does not give a refund on DVDs if opened .. but I did not know the awful quality .. until I opened it a played it. Can these rules be changed?)"
2,Machu Picchu lover,"Not worth it. ONLY 15 minutes long. Cover (Earth Globe view) is not as pictured, which is disappointing because it was to be a Birthday gift. NO music."
4,Deadly Karate Blows: The Medical Implications (Unique Literary Books of the World),Book was as described. It was used and in good shape. Will be using the book as I progress through Kung Fu.
4,an instuctors must,"How many times have you told a student to do a combination and not known what the result of their actions will be.How many off us know what dammage we can do.This book covers max to minimum dammage, in a well illusrated and easy to follow book.Next time I teach a strike to the throat I can explain what can happen, we all have an idea but do you really know.As an instuctor you should know what you are teaching a student and if it lands what could happen."
3,"Not a How-To book, But a What If","This book was written by someone in the medical profession who was also into martial arts. The book is not a how-to book, but rather one of what could happen. He sights a range of injuries when being struck. The result of the strike will vary based upon many factors, such as, proper targeting, power delivered, age and health of victim, etc. The book is intended to be a medical view of what may result from a strike.I found it useful to reinforce why certain strikes can be dangerous for beginning students and why control is stressed throughout class."
3,"Convenient, but not long lasting","This is the second pair that I have purchased and both within the first few wears got tears down one leg. That being said, I love the way they look and feel and overall they are great. However, with the general wear and tear of putting them on, washing, taking off, removing the toes to put on different shoes or pointe pads, they are more likely to wear easily.Since there really aren't other great alternatives that I have found yet to these out there besides other brands, I would still buy them."
4,great value,"For the price, these strings are great for a young talented player. My high school daughter is very happy with them."
4,Great Strings for the student or amateur,"I played for ten years and used dominants and evahs primarily. after a hiatus I've started playing again, and these provide a very clean sound. Decent on the lower strings, and the e isn't too pitchy which is my biggest gripe with most strings. Think I might try the pro forte next by d'addario."
2,Sounds Like Banjo Strings,These strings are cheap so thats a plus but thats about it with the sound more resembling banjo stings. I simply could not get a good sound out these even though I tried and tried. Everything just doesn't sound right and more metallic and too sharp for my ears. I played for my wife who said that they sounded really bad. They are really thin and feel cheap almost like the strings that came with my violin (a cheap violin). Do yourself a favor and pay extra for good strings but than again if these stings would of been five or ten bucks than I would be happy knowing what I would probably be getting. These strings would be a good starting point though so don't get me wrong. I just have learned to like better and little more expensive strings.
3,Ok...,"Broke two of the strings (A and E) first time I tuned them. Otherwise, they sound ok. Not too shabby for the price."
3,Acceptable,"I prefer Shar's Overture premieres which are the same price. These ones are a little too ""bright"" in sound and not deep or resonant enough. Also bear in mind these are not dominants which are clearly far superior - but for which you would be paying $50 a set."
3,Great for beginners,"I am very new to the violin and bought the cheapest one I could find off eBay. That means my violin kind of sucks in tone and quality, but I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on an instrument I didn't love. Of course, my cheap-o strings broke immediately so I replaced them with these.These strings hold up very well to the abuse a brand new violin player gives them. They're pretty hardy and they haven't snapped yet, despite 6 months of tuning up every day. The rosin sticks to them and is hard to wipe off completely but that may be normal to violins in general. In short, if you are just starting to play and not sure if you're going to stick with it, these strings are perfect. Once you've decided to love the violin forever and become an expert, that's when it's time to spend the big bucks."
3,Pretty decent sci-fi game,"In this game you fly a spaceship which can fire various weapons. Your objective is to rescue the space pods and to destroy enemies. Graphics are surprising good for a first-generation Jaguar game with a decent polygon count. Audio is nice as well...although Skylar's voice can get irritating after a while. Controls are nice...it really helps to have the Cybermorph keypad overlay over the Jaguar's 12-button keypad. This game makes full use of the Jaguar controller, including the keypad.Cybermorph is a decent game...but it's sequel, Battlemorph (for the very rare Atari Jaguar CD) is worlds better with amazing graphics and amazing audio."
1,Not the travelogue I expected and wanted.,I was expecting to get a tour of Alaska and instead it was just about one area and the games they play there. Very disappointing!!
3,Good book but many errors,"This is a good book, well-organized and contains many useful materials. However I do not recommend it as an independent study textbook (which is what I did). There are many errors, most of them are typographical but some of them are wrong numbers which are very difficult to correct, especially in the exercises given. And the exercises are very important -- the following discussions and proofs depend on some of them. Springer published a ""corrected second printing"" in 1999 but obviously they didn't do a good job (I purchased the new one and I got the old one in the library)."
1,cheap shoes,The laces tore and are loose. I guess you get what you pay for. The leather is thin and cheap.
4,Loafers,Great product. Be careful on sizing. They run small. I bought 1/2 size larger and they are snug. Great shoes.
5,Great for anywhere and any weights!,This pole can hold anyone up to 200-lbs. Great for all pole tricks. I THREE of these in my living room. Easy installation and the the removability of the pole is literally seconds. Highly recommended.
4,Not too bad,"I read reviews before ordering this and found one that said it was very durable and could sustain the weight of a 6' male. Well, that is true. They aren't as durable as I anticipated, but they are loads of fun! It's very hard to balance on them and the majority of fun is falling off them. My kids are having a blast!"
2,Read the Novel,"This volume, suitable only for serious Gus Van Sant fans, contains the original script text for the disasterous movie of the fine Tom Robbins novel. The script adaptation drags and completly loses the counterculture spirit of the novel. Unless you are a film student, skip this and read the novel while listening to k.d. lang's excellent film score."
1,"Wrong, wrong, wrong.","Sometimes you just watch a film that drags so painfully it hurts your heart. Tom Robbin's book is by far one of the best i've ever read---none of what made that book so phenomenal was even attempted to be recreated in the film.And what's with Keanu Reeves? TEDIOUS, man."
3,Happy Birthday Dr. King,"I really enjoyed this book.When Jamal got in a fight I really thought it was a good example of what Dr. King did to help us.I bet when people read this book they will want to celebrate Dr. kings birthday, because what he did for us.Dr. King really made a difference in our world.Jamals grandpa got mad at him because black people back then were force to sit in the back of the bus."
2,Pretty worthless,I'm not sure why I even downloaded this book. i read a few dozen pages then decided I wanted the minutes back that I had wasted.
1,Yawn. Don't Bother.,"If you haven't committed your life to Freemasonry, this book is meaningless and boring. If you have, then this is overly simplistic.It's not particularly accurate about the rituals of each level, which is not surprising since they're secret. It is stunningly repetitive (which is rather consistent with the rituals of Freemasonry, now that I think about it)."
1,Get something else!,"Unfortunately this is not the original book written by William Morgan. It is a author unapproved version of his book (because he was killed before it was published). The book was revised and corrected by the Grand Master Mason George R. Crafts. It would have been nice to read William Morgans original script even if it was not correct and faulty. A written foreword by a Master Mason would be nice as well and is missing. This book is literally obsolete.If you want an accurate account of all the degrees get the book ""Richardson's Monitor of Freemasonry"" instead."
3,Not bad for a freebie,This book is pretty good if you are interested in freemasons. I would recommend it for people who are really into the subject.
2,A Bit Dry and Slow,"I have to be honest...I am a total snoop. I am curious about all things off limits to me, but the FreeMasonry was different. I got this book hoping to learn some of the history and how the Masons tied into that history. This book was much different. Very repetitive, often times tedious to get through, the book draaaagggeed on. There were aspects that were interesting and I did come away from the book knowing more about the Free Masons than I previously had. The question being then, how much of this did I really want to know? Unless you are an avid fan, I would say skip it."
3,Few surprises!,"This book is not about some secret conspiracy to run the World, as some say is the Masonic purpose.Instead, it is a detailed description of the meeting rituals and qualifications to join and advance in the Masonic orders. What is revealed is a religious (primarily Protestant Christian) fraternity whose secretism comes from the times of the Crusades when being a Christian could be a death sentence.As it describes verbatim detail of the rituals of each level of the Masonry, and as each level builds on previous levels, the book is very repetitive. The book is neither entertaining nor revealing of any dark purpose among the Masons.It is a book that should satisfy those with curiosity about The Masonic orders. And it should calm the fears some have of the Masons."
1,"Comments on ""Mysteries of Freemasonry""","I do not know why William Morgan even wrote this book and possibly risked his life (Apparently no one knows what actually happened to him after the book was written). The book would only be of interest to those who are considering joining the Freemasons or those interested in the inner workings of secret societies. It does not say anything about the history and symbology behind all the Masonic rituals and traditions and their actual meaning. It only describes what goes on in a Masonic lodge in a condescending manner. It is a total waste of time. There are much better books on the subject of Freemasonry, Born in Blood being the best one that I have read."
2,Wasn't what I was expecting...,I thought it would be more of a conspiracy type book. This is almost a word for word account of meetings and initiations for club members...kinda creepy that this exists.
5,These videos saved my life,I was struggling through a statistics class with a teacher who can barely speak English. These videos totally saved me. They are easy to understand and cover all the important topics.
2,Best characterized as amateurish,"I love many genres of music including techno, experimental electronica, metal, rock, jazz... you name it. I was hoping from reading the reviews that this would be a nice rock/techno album with real music. Instead, I got an album which can be best characterized as amateurish. If you are one of the people who likes this album/band for whatever reason go ahead and purchase this. If on the other hand you're experimenting with different types of music, and want to go with this album because of the ratings, your money is better spent somewhere else."
5,Chucky doll,"I just received this doll today for Christmas. I'm ten, about to turn eleven. There was one gift left under the tree. I have to say it was nothing I expected, But I loved it! The detail is great. My favorite part is the eyes, it has so much detail, It almost looks like Chucky's staring you down, ready to hurt you. The expression seems so real too. The outfit has great detail on the smallest things, however, I do wish the shoes had real laces, as they are made of plastic. The hair is the perfect shade of red, and is just the right length. I recomend this doll to all fans of the Child Play series."
4,Happy With Fivel,"Fivel is a female-fronted alternative rock group along the lines of Veruca Salt or Belly with a slightly harder edge and a Scandinavian accent. The album suffers from a slight 'been here done that' feel as the album progresses, but the first half is a true treat, with songs like 'Convict Grass' and 'Happy With Traci' turning themselves into cranial peanut butter. (Translation - this'll be stuck in your head for awhile)Not necessary, but absolute fun anyway."
4,Travel Czech,"This book includes a Czech-English and English-Czech dictionary, as well as a basic grammar section and even a short history of the Czech Republic. After looking at several Czech dictionaries, this is the one that I've found to be easiest to use and is best suited for a tourist or casual student of the language."
3,Good guide for a traveller,"If you make a trip to the Czech republic and want to understand a few words, while you are in the airport, restaurant, city centre etc. then this book is appropriate for you. It provides a brief list with the most common words you will need, when staying in Czech republic for a few days. But remember! Only the most common. If you need something more detailed, you have to look for an appropriate dictionaty."
5,Inspirational and Touching,"A cookbook, yes, but the recipes take a back seat to the anecdotes and snapshots of Jacob and his brief but joyous life. Diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a fatal cancer, Jacob was an inspiration and a model of grace throughout his terrible ordeal. The poem by his grandmother will make you both laugh and weep. A gem."
2,Not different enough,"I used to read the off Grisham, but I've stopped now because a.) I'm tired of Southern lawyers struggling against their social betters and b.) Grisham's 'rules' about what works in a thriller and what doesn't are always too slavishly followed. The problem with this book is that it's too close to Grisham, without having its own unique angle. Why not strike out, JF?"
1,The worst legal thriller I've ever read,"This book was the worst legal thriller I've ever read. The author has unbelievable charecters, an unbelievable plot an the writing is unbelievably bad.As a lawyer, for me, one of the worst parts about this book are the courtroom scenes. If I tried any of the stunts described in the book, I'd be locked up and lose my law license.This was one of the worst books I've read in a long time. What a pity I can't get my money back."
2,Good story; amateurish writing,"This was my first Freedman novel and I found the story fun; but there were factual errors and basic writing gaffes which detracted from the experience. Some phrases were straight out of a bad romance novel, for example, ""She was a beast; but when he closed his eyes, she was a woman."" Is the author still in high school?Dialog for some characters was inconsistent and in some cases, overly stereotyped. For pure entertainment, it was fine; but if you're looking for a well-written novel, there are plenty of others to choose from."
4,Suspenseful Mystery,"Wyatt Mathews, bored with his corporate law practice decides to give it up temporarily to try his hand at pro-bono criminal trial law. His midlife crisis as his wife calls it, upsets his socialite home life, including a marriage which he is forced to re-examine.Besides being a suspenseful mystery, Freedman helps us to see that no matter what your monthly paycheck, having a job you feel good about is far more rewarding and challenging. A thought provoking read"
4,Good Read,"If you like Perry Mason material, you'll like this book. I must say that one of my pet peeves about modern-day authors is that they like to jump around with many sub-plots which come togehter during the book. I wish there were current authors who could tell a story with a continuous story line. Freedman likes to jump around with many sub-plots; this I don't like. His relationships, particularly the romantic ones, are a bit thin. But I really enjoyed the read. For me, in spite of the criticisms above, this was a real ""page turner"" and I found myself reading well into the night because I couldn't put the book down; unusual for me."
4,Male protagonist thinks like women would like men to think,"Wyatt Matthews says he's sorry, believes in therapy, heck, he probably even stops to ask directions. Halfway through the book, swearing that the author was female, I looked at the photo inside the back cover--it's a man! This book is full of a few more surprises, and it's pleasing not to be able to figure everything out before it happens. Although the female characters are not as richly configured, it's a great read."
4,Good book by a great writer,"This is my first Freedman book, and it was very good. The man knows how to write and sustain a compelling plot. Yes, courtroom trials depicting lawyers trying to save innocent men has been done over and over, but Freedman manages to keep things fresh and interesting for over six hundred pages. I'll definitely read more of his work. Highly recommended over Grisham!"
4,Another good summer read,This was my second J. F. Freedman book I have read and am ready to buy his other books. He is a good storyteller and the plot always thickens. His writing skills keep you turning the pages unable to put the book down. This book was enjoyable because there was much more action than just courtroom drama.
3,Interesting but could be shorter,"The story of Marianne Strauss's life in hiding during WWII is truly amazing, and unlike anything I've read before (and I read a lot of WWII / Holocaust books). I'd rate it higher, except that it's overly detailed in some cases. The book is as much about the author's eforts to uncover the truth behind Marianne's memories (vs. those of others she knew) as it is about Marianne's life. I found the author's very detailed account of getting info out of Marianne and her acquaintances too much information; all I cared about was Marianne's story, not how he found out and verified every detail. I recommend it, as long as you're prepared to skim when your eyes glaze over."
4,Great Oldiers CD,"Product exceeds my expectations and arrived in a timely fashion. Very happy with both shipment and service, along with a great product. I highly recommend this to all customers for a future purchase. Brings back memories!"
1,Horrible!,"I saw clips for this on YouTube, and then discovered this DVD, and bought it based on the clips I saw. A great performance ... but what a disappointment!!This is clearly a 2nd or 3rd generation dub from some videotape, so already, it's NOT the best video. Given that, I could deal with it, and occasional additional distortion to the picture, but what's incredibly frustrating are the drop-outs in the sound! At least every 5 or 10 mins, there's NOT just a click, but an actual drop-out! At least 20-25 drop-outs are scattered throughout the whole thing, and occasionally, other minor distortions in the sound, which I could ALSO deal with, but NOT DROP-OUTS! It's basically unlistenable, and it's unlikely that I will watch this again, despite the fact that the performance is cool -- it's just an excercise in frustration.I was warned by some of the guys on the Zappa.com forum, and they were right. I wouldn't pay 3 dollars for this thing.Maybe 2."
4,Frank - The final tour,"This video, while not authorized by the Zappa Family Trust is a cool document of the short-lived 1988 Zappa big band. A warm introduction is given by Frank in Spanish (learned ""parrot fashion) and the tight, well-seasoned band of the ""Broadway The Hard Way"" album kicks in with a mixture of fresh material and old favorites. Five horns, Ike Willis on vocals, Mike Keneally on stunt guitar, and a real-live Synclavier on stage. And some truly mind bending guitar solos by the maestro. Great fun. The aspect ratio is 4 by 3, the audio is stereo, and the video quality is ok, but not great. It's all about the music. If you enjoy this type of entertainment, you will not be disappointed."
3,So So,"It's always fun to see something of Zappa, but the transformation of the concert to the DVD was done poorly. One of the songs was cut in the middle and there are jump cuts in the sound throughout the DVD."
1,"Download it for free, do not buy from the bootleggers","Hi:This is a great performance from a 1988 show in Spain. It was broadcast on TV and recorded on a VCR. After passing several generations, it was bootlegged. With a little searching on the internet, I am sure that you can find the entire show. There is a version that did not have a song interrupted by a Pepsi Commercial. I would not support bootleggers buy purchasing this item and I think a crisper music and video version exists on the internet.If you like all live performances, I would recommend from the ZFT, The Torture Never Stops and when the ZFT get around to releasing it, the Roxie Shows.Best wishes,Pete"
1,Worst Audio and Video Ever,"I'm a huge Zappa fan and bought this a while back and before there were any reviews (a mistake). This was probably a great concert, completely ruined by the horrible audio and video. This is the worst I've ever seen going back all the way to my first VCR in 1982. I know it's technically digital, but crap in equals crap out. Do not waste your money at any price offered until a respectable release is made by ZFT."
1,Zappa in Barcelona: European Tour May 1988- Don't Support!,"Normally I would review anything related to Frank thoroughly enough that I didn't have already and wait in anticipation! If Frank saw these folk putting out whatever they can for whatever reason, he'd be pissed, simple enough! So much work goes into any production not put out yet by the ZFT, these con artists are like any other out there!If you want to spend some money, go to the Dweez's site for the Zappa plays Zappa shows coming up and help decide on the material for the shows coming up, and then go see them!!!"
1,Can you say bootleg?,"When I saw this under ""Today's Deals"", I got excited. I thought maybe this was finally being released officially.As soon as I got to the product page, I could tell right away it is indeed a bootleg. For starters, the label is ""101 Distribution."" Have you ever heard of it? I haven't.Second, the cover art....neither the stage nor the large picture of Frank is from 1988. Not even close.It's bad enough that there are bootleggers making money off of this garbage on Ebay, but do we have to be wary of Amazon now too?There has been an ""unofficial"" fan copy of this in circulation for years, and the quality is better than this one (re-dubbed audio and relevant artwork). Best of all, it's for FREE trade, not selling. You just have to know where to look.Until such time that they release an official version of this made from the master recording, I wouldn't recommend anyone spend a dime on this. Save your money and find a better copy elsewhere."
1,Not worth it,This looks like an amateur DVD. I think a middle school project would have been more interesting. I would like to get a refund.
4,The highlight of the Yellow Rose Series,"4.5 stars! Lori Wick has redeemed my faith in her as a writer. I went into this book with a little apprehension after my dissapointment with Texas Sky, but Lori came through with another great book. The spirtual conversations were great in this book and you fall in love with Cash and Reagan right from the start. We also hear about the Dakota and Slater and even find out what happens with the boys parents. This book was definelty the best of the series. If you liked the first two, you will love this one. If you were dissapointed in the first two, you will like this one a lot better."
4,City Girl shows attraction of the country life.,"In the third and last of the Yellow Rose Triology, City Girl continues the charm of the Rawling's Family Life.Reagan Sullivan decides to leave New York for a job in Texas to broaden her life experiences.Little did she know the different ways she would be touched by this adventure.This book shares the enjoyment of meeting new people and learning about new and different ways people live. It teaches about sacrifice and responsibility and of course love and respect.It is a good read."
5,Two thumbs up!!! Way up!!!,"I loved this book!! Reagan's distrust of men even went as far as not trusting God. However, when she gave her heart to Christ, her fears slowly went away. Cash never rushed her. He waited for her to fall in love with him in her own time. I loved this book!! It is one I will always keep!!"
3,Ack!,"As Lori Wick's books go, this book seemed sadly monotonous to me. I am an avid reader of Christian fiction and place Lori Wick at the very top of my favorite authors list. I have read every last book she's written and have noticed that almost every series has a book that doesn't enhance the series. I just about counted the days waiting for this book to become available and when it finally did, i spent the time needed to complete the book. I felt that while it had its cute parts, it lacked a riveting storyline that Mrs. Wick normally manages to include in her other novels. I will still wait anxiously for the next book written by Lori Wick!"
2,Not Good,"I would have to say that this was one of the worst series by Lori Wick that I have read. I have read all of her books and I was so excited when I learnt that she was writing the Yellow Rose Trilogy. They were a huge letdown though. In this book the story seemed to drag on and it didn't seem real at all. It was good to see how Slater and Dakota were coping with their marriages but, overall it was a very disappointing series."
5,"Immortal is dead, long live Horgh!","I have anticipated this cd since I first read about it in Pit magazine last fall. I was dismayed to learn of the demise of thr mighty Immortal but looked forward to Grimfist eagerly, and have listened to little else since recieving it. Brutal simply doesn't cover this death metal masterpiece. Primal Agression, From Hell and Back, and the title track all stand out on an album with no weak tracks. If you like Carnal Forge, The Crown, Marduk and of Course Immortal why don't you own this?Of course Horgh is godlike behind the kit but the guitars will rip your face off and the vocals are demonic. THIS ALBUM IS KILLER!!!"
5,Your future is Grim!,"This CD blazes. This is one of the best CDs of 2003. You won't regret buying this if you are a fan of heavy music. The songs are memorable, heavy, and thrashy. I can't get this CD out of my player!"
1,THANKS 4 NOTHIN,"Well I strongly discourage anyone from buying this or any other product from "" THE SPORTSMAN'S GUIDE"". I just receivied my fly poll and reel and it showed up with part of the poll sticking out of the mangled box and broken! when I called customer service and spoke with supervisor by the name of ""PAIGE""they said ""OH SORRY BUT I GUESS WE JUST WRECKED YOUR CHRISTMAS"" horrible service and if I could give them a negative ""star"" I certainly would! again I'd like to thank ""paige"" for her sarcasm, that really helped the situation!"
2,Verb forms,The main problem I hadf with this book is the names of the parts of the verbs. This book does not use the Italian name for the the part of the verb. This means if you are studing Italian you have to go back and forth and make sure you have the correct tense. So I don't care for that and gave this book away.
2,"Could have been a 3 star, but.......","This was not a bad read for the most part. The last half of the book had me staying up past midnight (a rare feat for me). However, the author went overboard in trying to show me how awful the death penalty is. I know that writers are perfectly entitled to incorporate their moral views into their writing, but it goes to far when the reader feels manipulated and starts thinking of putting the book down. I'm glad I continued to read on, but a detailed scenerio of someone dying in the electric chair (complete with electrical malfunction) reminded me of people that shove pictures of fetuses in front of abortion patients. There's a lot of context dropping and sermonizing.The book is interesting, although the ending is no surprise. The main character, as admitted on the book cover, is no hero. He shows some integrity, but is inconsistant.Not a bad read, but there are better books out there."
1,NOT a 500 sheet tray,"This tray does not hold 500 sheets, not without jamming. You can only fill it up half way or else it will jam on every try. I have had this add on tray for 1 year and am very unhappy with it's performance. It will constantly jam (bad design, see my review for the T640 printer to learn more)."
2,weak,"Of course a band is not capable of realsing masterpiece after masterpiece indefinitely. After ""PURPENDICULAR"", it was natural that Purple's next CD would be a little weaker. But I could not imagine that it would stand so many miles behind ""PURPENDICULAR""..."
1,Disappointing follow-up to Purpendicular,"when guitarist Ritchie Blackmore was replaced by ex-Dregs Steve Morse, a breath of fresh air blew through the tired old retread that was Deep Purple. The album, Purpendicular, was refreshingly different and diverse. Abandon, in contrast, ias a disappointment -- a return to the same old atavistic stodge. Forgettable."
2,Not very good,"I loved surprisingly loved Purpendicular despite Blackmore leaving and was excited about Abandon when it came out. When I heard this I thought they ran out of gas at this point cuz this album was sooo uninspired. It sounds like DP on auto pilot. No crazy classical Jon Lord solos, just noodling and Steve Morse left me longing for Ritchie with his wanking. I almost didn't give Bananas a try because this one was such a bore. Bananas BTW was pretty good."
4,it is with great abandon that i enjoyed this cd,"i really liked this cd, especially steve morse guitar playing. some of the songs are a little weak, but the sounds make up for it."
4,They've done it again,"Not quite as good as some of the stuff from the '70s, but close. Ian Paice may not be as fast as he once was, Ian Gillan may not have quite the voice he had in 1970, nad Steve Morse isn't Ritchie Blackmore, but still the old mix of great lyrics and musicians without equal to back them up. Wonderfull"
4,Still rockin',"I think it's amazing how these guys, well into their fifties, can still put out good music! While I'll admit that Morse is no Blackmore, on these past two albums he has done a good job keeping that ""purple"" feel. Gillan is still an unbelievable singer: soulful, charasmatic, and sometimes downright nasty! Paicey, in my mind, hasn't slowed down at all on the sticks. Glover and Lord are still fantastic. This particular lineup, on their second album, delivered some goods. ""Any Fule Kno That""-some nonsense lyrics, but a hard n' heavy song. ""Almost Human,"" ""Don't Make me Happy,"" ""Seventh Heaven,"" ""Watching the Sky,"" ""Fingers to the Bone,"" and the remake of ""Bloodsucker"" are all the highlights of the album. The first half was better than the second, but overall it turned out to be a solid album by a veteran hard-rock band. I can't wait for their next studio release, Gillan promised that it would be a good one!"
3,Some comments about Blackmore,"GOt all Purple studio albums. All of them, including the Tommy Bolin album (COME TASTE THE BAND), the horrible ""SLAVES AND MASTERS"" (Joe Lynn Turner? Who hired this guy?!! Probably Blackmore, because he sung in Rainbow),etc.I was suspicious when Morse joined the band. BUt, to my surprise, PUrple became a stronger unit, freed from Blackmore egocentric, egoistic and ""diva"" character.ABANDON is good, just that. Purpendicular is much better, no doubt about that."
2,I second the disappointment after Purpendicular,"Previous review said: ""when guitarist Ritchie Blackmore was replaced by ex-Dregs Steve Morse, a breath of fresh air blew through the tired old retread that was Deep Purple. The album, Purpendicular, was refreshingly different and diverse. Abandon, in contrast, ias a disappointment -- a return to the same old atavistic stodge. Forgettable. ""I agree. Loved Purp cause it was different (Dixie Purple or Purple Dregs?), this is too much like Blackmore's Purple. Been there, done that."
4,They've still got it !!,"This has to be one of Deep Purple's best efforts. Ian Gillan's vocals are still cutting through to the spine of every listener. Glover, Lord and Paice...Fantastic, as usual. The only element missing is Ritchie Blackmore. This in no way is meant to take away from Steve Morse. This album comes in a close second to the early albums (In Rock, Fireball, Machine Head, WDWTWA), and no question about it, beats the efforts of the Coverdale years. Buy It Listen To It And it will become one of your favorites. But.... ANY FULE KNO THAT"
4,A good cd,My favorite tracks from this cd are the opening two on the cd. The cd gets a little bluesy toward the middle. There a couple of songs that I can't get into on it. Jack Ruby and Blodsucker. I think the opening track makes worthy of buying alone.
3,Dries up too quickly,"Having the two tips is great, but the ""ultra fine"" tip tends to dry up rather too quickly."
1,Don't buy!,"Lousy sound-mix, Mr. Offord must have been asleep (or stoned out of his mind)at the desk.It sounds like members of the Moraz, Howe and Anderson families were battling over the sound controls during production - and the Morasses dominated most of the time.The camera usually gets it right, so you see where the action is, still you hear the wrong instrument playing, which is very frustrating.The worst rockumentary I've seen so far."
4,open the gates,"good value DVD,nice to get some earlyish Yes in this format. Product arrived swiftly and intact."
5,great album,"Well, to start off, whoever typed the track listings above goofed, so ignore them. There are actually 8 tracks on the first disc, and 9 on the second. The track lists are as follows:(song>Artist) DISC 1: 1.paradise> Noise Unit 2.biosphere> Noise Unit 3.amnesia> Delerium 4.eros> Pro-tech 5.phenomena> Equinox 6.otherside> Synaesthesia 7.the drain> Noise Unit 8.amorphous> Front Line Assembly. DISC 2: 1.miracle> Noise Unit 2.inner chaos> Noise Unit 3.ambience> Delerium 4.electronic dream> Equinox 5.re-thread> Pro-tech 6.floatation> Synaesthesia 7.alle gegan alle> Noise Unit 8.penance> Front Line Assembly 9.turmoil>(leeb/balch) There you have it! As for the music, it's what you'd usually expect from the musical prodigy known as Bill Leeb. In other words, it kicks ass. All the songs are the originals, no remixes. Some are new, some are old- but they're all good. If you're a fan of any of Bill Leeb's work, this album is a must-have. I recommend it to all industrial music fans."
1,"Nice Cover, Messieur de Sade.","Like I said, ""Nice cover,"" but without reading the entire manuscript this was like perusing the shopping list of Hell, all notation, no substance. These ""Passions"" are nothing more than reiteration of the scenes in the original book ""The 120 Days of Sodom"", a sort of preview to acts to follow. The actual tome ""The 120 Days of Sodom"" is about 600 pgs long and includes a really cool short story called ""Florville and Courval"" (akin to Alfred Hitchcock) that is well worth your time.I bought this before Groove Press released the whole shebang. This is very much a rough draft and hardly worth even one star. But it is a NICE cover, baby!Au revoir, mon petite de le amour."
2,"Just a race, no surfing","If you're looking for a SURFING game, this isn't it. They're just racing around a course on a surfboard."
4,"the kids love it, especially as they are all learning how to surf!!",my 4 kids from 10 years and younger all love surfs up. i think they can relate to the surfing skills and are pretty impressed!
1,very dissapointed!,"I purchased the 80 pod Newman's Own box. I have always greatly loved aroma and taste of unflavored Columbian coffee, and had enjoyed unflavored coffee pods that came with machine, including the the extra bold pods. However, though the Newman's own pods are not indicated as being flavored, they alas are. I've once in a while gotten same aroma and taste at truck stops and restaurants, but don't know what the flavoring is. Hate the aroma, hate the flavor; what I want is UNADULTERATED PURE COFFEE. Trying to find someone who likes Newman's own pods so I can give them away."
3,"Man, That ""Tony Twist"" lawsuit must be hurting 'em.","I have always liked the Spawn figures from McFarlane toys because of the righteous detail that give their figures, but seriously, what do they cast these things from, Marzipan? The detail is, as always, awesome, but it doesn't matter, because I snapped peices off of it taking it out of the box. This is not the first time I've had a Mc Farlane figure come apart on me, either. What's the point of putting seven bazillion points of articulation on a figure if you're scared to move them because you don't know which one of them is inevitably going to snap off? I honestly have a Dark Ages Spawn figure that fell over from a standing postion, and the ARM snapped off FROM THE FIGURE'S OWN WEIGHT."
3,I couldn't help it...,"I don't even own any Spawn figures, but when I saw this guy, I had to buy him. He just looks so cool! One of the best villain action figures I have ever seen! But upon manipulating him just a little bit, the thumb and finger of his usable hand came off. I had to glue them back on. So thumbs down for that. Plus, his little friends don't stand up too well on their own, you have to position them up against the figure itself as depicted in the cover art. He's still one of the better looking figures that have come out in some time. I'm just afraid to touch him!"
4,The Curse could be cursed!!,"This is one of my favorite figures but he is delicate, so watch how you handle him. If something doesn't move or it's seems stiff leave it be or you could damage it. Oh it's always good to have super glue on stand by."
2,The story had potential but . .,"It was written in such a disjointed manner that it really lacked the impact it could have had. The main characters have great potential but the story just didn't hold together. My biggest problem was that the background on the main characters and the dastardly villian who is after them was so poorly described that I found myself saying, ""WHAT? Wait a minute, that doesn't make sense."" I quickly found myself losing interest in these people when I couldn't even understand their history. Other annoying moments included when one character mentions, "" so and so just told me . . . "" but,you guessed it, the story never indicated that conversation had happened! A convincing and enjoyable story is all in the details for me. This writer needs a better editor."
2,"I agree with the ""Cash"" reviewer!","I, too, was extremely disappointed in this book. I expected better by JoAnn! I totally agree with the reviewer named ""Cash."" That review pretty much mirrors what I have to say about it. Nuff Said!"
1,Big disappointment!,"I have enjoyed many of this author's previous books, but was shockingly disappointed by the inconsistencies in Out of the Blue. Where was her editor on this one? The back cover said Danny was murdered, but he survived. Why were the kids getting out of school for the snowstorm between Christmas and New Year's? Weren't they on Christmas break? Why was her ex-husband broke? If he was so instrumental in building her career, why didn't he get half in the divorce settlement? The rest of the book wasn't interesting enough make up for these problems. I hope the third in this trilogy proves to be better than the second."
2,Another Stewart sister story disappointment,"Famous country singer reunites with her old teen BF who left her to join the marines. In the meantime, she's also busy dealing with a psycho-stalker who kidnapped her years before & just escaped from prison, her lying ex-manager ex-husband, & the mystery of who shot her drummer.Just like Out of the Mist, this story about another Stewart sister was a bust. I've read other Ross books (i.e., Freefall, Blaze, Blue Bayou, Southern Comfort) & this one lacked the heat, organization, & excitement of her other books. Sexual chemistry & sex scenes were ok. Romance was woven with the suspense in a choppy, distracting way. Reading it was a chore since I had to sometimes go back a few pages to try to make sense of what was going on. Also, the heroine's reactions to all the current & past tragedies in her life was not very realistic or believable.Minimally recommended."
1,One interesting chapter,this book has one helpful area; it gives you a good list of questions to ask your forex broker/dealer before you sign on as customer; appears to be casting for clients for his firm; otherwise a waste of eyeballs.
2,good for basic understanding of fx but otherwise a let down.,"I was dissapointed as I expected this book to really focus on different strategies for fx traders for their portfoliio. Instead it concentrates too much on operational issues, legal documentation and different types of risk in the market (without offering strategies to hedge those risks). It has 32 pages of useless charts, 47 pages of terminology and even discusses legal fx court cases. Sorry, not for me......"
2,To be fair,"I started reading this book, but after the first two chapters I returned it to the store so that I could buy a book dealing with what I wanted to know. But, to be fair, this author did write a good book on the basics of futures trading."
2,The Cover PAge looks pretty!!!,"Well when i grow up i to be Russell R Wasendorf, whether sr. or jr. I think these two are the greatest salesmen around. I bought a wonderful book which adorns my bookcase and adds colour and life to my room. Whats more is that i found the same book in my brother's home. Thinking he 'borrowed' it I asked him, He replied saying he 'invested' in it and it works well as a sleep aide . Seriously some points for beginners are reasonably covered but most of the book was a waste of time, paper and resources. There were no Fine points covered in the book to memory but if there were it was lost in the dribble."
1,This book really is not about teaching someone to trade,"I was looking for a basic book teaching the concepts and trading practices and fundamentals. This book has a lot to say about none of the topics needed to help someone become a trader. If you are looking to have someone trade your account you might be helped by it. There are a lot better books out there ""Getting Started in Currency Trading"" is a fine example. This is the best buy for the money when you are done reading it you will be much better informed to move ahead.Getting Started in Currency Trading: Winning in Todays Hottest Marketplace (Getting Started In.....)"
1,Rarely have encountered a book this useless.,"As others have said clearly, this book is a waste of trees, ink and the time of its reader. The ""authors"" should be ashamed of such blatant hucksterism and poor description of even the most basic aspects of trading. Even if you are a neophyte, look somewhere else."
1,not worth reading,"As other reviews pointed out, this book is really bad. There isn't any useful contents inside. No matter you are a student, trader or investor , you won't find anything helpful. No one should bother to read it."
1,Poor,The production quality is terrible. The information is near useless. The instruction is hard to follow. Not worth the money -- too bad
2,UNIX and Linux System and Networking was disappointing,"I thought it would be a good resource, but it did not add anything to my knowledge. I have already read this book: Your UNIX: The Ultimate Guide by Sumitabha Das, and it has all information you need to know about UNIX. If you have worked and played with linux/unix, then you don't need this DVD set. Somehow on the DVDs is printed ""become Certified UNIX System Administrator"" and that is a joke. With this DVD set you are not even close to pass a simple test. However, it is good basic knowledge for those who don't want to read books. I know that there is no way to cover all UNIX in 4 DVD set, but I think the creator of these DVD set could do much better. For example, instead of talking whole time about OSI and TCPIP model, he could use two/there unix/linux computers and show how one can create a good network using UNIX tools and commands."
3,True food adventurer,"Anyone who thinks he or she is a food adventurer should read this book. Gates has brought the adventure to a whole new level. I was amazed, thrilled, then aghast in the journey of the Gastronaut. Being a Chinese and a food lover, I never thought a Westerner can be as brave and as romantic about food. While a few of Gates's experience would make me frown and close the book for a few minutes, most stories are quite inspiring. I especially enjoy his ""cooking with gold"" and would like to try it out myself someday."
3,Another foodie book,I read a lot of food memoirs and this one is good but really not the best. There are very few recipes you can actually duplicate. The stories accompanying the recipes are so-so. It is a pleasurable read but not one you will likely re-read.
4,The Trilogy Continues,"Jay Marvin is a poet, author and objectivist. He's also one of this generation's most prolific science fiction writers. ""Punk Blood"" is the second installment of a trilogy that Marvin refers to as his ""Sci-Thrillogy-Noir"". It picks up right where the first book, ""Seti Alpha Punk"" left off. Our protagonist, K7 Alpha, a cyborg, has run out of gas in the middle of the Nevada desert, near Area 51. I won't give away any more than that, but I will warn you of the very graphic poisoning scene that everyone's talking about: you wont' ever view coffee the same again. A real boink for the peepers!"
4,"Once you get into the author's style, you can't put it down","It took me a couple of pages to get into the rhythm and style of Mr. Marvin's writing, but once I did, it was difficult to put the book down. Very good read, I've found myself mentally returning to it time after time over the weeks since finished reading it."
4,Sick... twisted... I love it!,"Jay Marvin takes you into the mind of a mad man. I really liked the twisted storyline. The run-on writing style takes a while to get used to, but eventually it'll become second nature. Another good book is Kane and Abel's Eyes of a Killer/Behind Enemy Lines. I thrive on the noir these books give."
1,Great DVD to put one to sleep,"It so happened that whenever I watched the video, I ended up sleeping."
2,"good content, poor execution","This DVD has content related to a book I already owned and liked. The DVD seemed of somewhat amateurish quality but the content was good enough that I would have accepted the presentation. What I could not accept was the, at times, atrocious audio quality, particularly on the second disk. Manuel de la Torre is hard to impossible to hear on large sections of the DVD. I tend to think this is due to the production though I haven't seen it mentioned in the several reviews I read. If this quality is present on each DVD, I would recommend Amazon cease selling this item. Alternatively, let prospective buyers beware. Only if you are already familiar with the concepts of the golf swing from the companion book will you find this DVD helpful."
2,Toss this in the garbage - there are better Dyer books,"Or, you may prefer to tear out the pages that are not worthwhile; Dyer has truly written some excellent books. However, the ones you want to read are those he published in the 80's and 90's. There's a lot of sage wisdom to be found in those. But this? Please. I've written this old man off mainly because he's discarded common sense for religious nonsense, and that's really disappointing. May I share one of the bits of ""insight"" to be found in this book? Here: ""LIVE the Ten Commandments"". Say WHAT?!? Once I read that, I nearly cracked up laughing. What delusion. Having said that, there are some good things in the book, but it's not worth buying for them. Again, look to his earlier works for his best material, when he was mentally sound and sharp."
1,"Someone get her to a Berlitz class, quick!","Connie Francis sings in Spanish the way Charo sings in English. Come to think of it, Charo probably has LESS of an accent in English than Connie does in Spanish. Gringa espanol, all the way."
1,"""A Lady of Spain"" -- NOT!","Commenting on the previous review, this disc will only have you thinking Connie's a lady of Spain if you think Spanish speakers all have flat, American accents. Connie's accent is bad. If you want to hear a non-Spanish speaker sing in Spanish, try Johnny Mathis, Nana Mouskouri or Sheena Easton. They all have less of an accent than Connie does, who sounds like she has no idea what she is singing and seems to have trouble getting her tongue around some of the sounds. Even better, get a disc by someone who can actually SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND the language. I recommend Vikki Carr, Rocio Durcal or Rocio Banquells. (I'm from Spain, by the way)."
2,Very Bad Gun!!!!,"In my opinion, I think that this rifle is bad for anyone who expects decent accuracy. I recieved this gun for my birthday, and it wasn't my first rifle, so i had an idea of what to expect. It was very decieving, the first time I shot it, I hit a can at a impressive length of 50 yards. The next day, the shots were moving around at 10 yards. It drove me nearly insane sighting the gun in. The only way this gun could be effective is if the buyer is willing to resight the scope virtualy every time they shoot it! Now that daisy (the company who created this gun) has made rifles that are better than this by a longshot, ( no pun intended) I would wait for mid year 2007."
2,Gabriel ultra truck shocks,Ordered Gabriel ultra truck shocks for the front on an 03 Silverado LS 2 wheel drive- installed easily- nice at first but after 3 months were spongey- front end bounces on even minor bumps- should have kept the old Bilstein HD's I had before- ultra doesn't mean ULTRA in this case- keep looking
5,**** 4-Star Book,"This book is absolutely fantastic.Mr. Philcox has done a valuable service to society. He evens email you back if you write him. I have not started on any of the ideas yet, but that's my fought, not the book's. I am researching the ideas and tailoring them to my interest and the needs of my community.There's truely something in this book for everyone interested. Can't rave about this book more than I have. Glad to read that others are making MONEY after reading this book.Way to Go! Not every book, like this one, DELIVERS."
3,Druids,This is a very good book but beware - it has rules to make druids very powerful. Powerful enough to unbalance a campaign.
3,A Priest,A druid is a priest of a specific denomination. They get one hit point per level and it only goes up to level 15. I'd rather be a wizard.
1,Good for druid campains.... but only druid campains,"This Book contains good information on playing druids, the single hardest class to roleplay(including paladins). It also has info on druid organization that the ""Players Handbook"" didn't have space for.so why only 1 star? because it's so impossible to play a charactor with a true neutral alignment right if your fellow players aren't true neutral as well. Sooner or later your druids' allies will(inadvertantly)force you to change alignment, ending your charactors' career.If you're a DM who wants to run an all-druid campain, get this book. otherwise, forget its existance."
1,Does not fit a '96 LX 2.2L,I ordered this item based on the compatibility confirmation from the Amazon system but it does NOT fit a '96 Accord LX with a 2.2L motor despite what the system tells you.
3,Petticoat Junction,The video is very clean and audio is good...however the original opening and closing music is not there. I would still buy it .
4,Petticoat junction,Good clean family entertainment. One of the classics of the 60's. Great cast of actors that play their parts well.
4,"""Come ride a little train...""","Nice work here-- just wish that Amazon would get the full series for Prime instant viewing. These are 7 episodes, but just not enough. Unlike Father Knows Best, this one serves more to perpetuate sexist stereotypes, but still does so in a good-hearted fashion. Alas, these episodes (at least the 4 or so we've watched so far) do NOT have the theme song being sung. The opening uses a different song with country guitar strumming & without words--yet, the episodes themselves do have the actual theme song-- just no words. It's a shame. We were looking forward to singing along, once again.Still, the characters live on...and""Uncle Joe is still moving kind of slow..."""
3,Remake,I didn`t realize this was a remake or I would not have bought it. When characters are changed their personalities also get changed.
5,Thanks for the nice time!,"What fun. This was obviously a labor of love by many people. The book is fund raiser for Manhattan (Kansas) Public Library and I hope they sell a ton of books. From the essays by top mystery writers to the short stories and the wonderful historical photos, I really enjoyed this book. The first story, ""Beecher's Bibles"" is flat out wonderful. I'd love to read more about the heroine of """"Cloche Encounter"" and ""Cached Out in the Little Apple"" ends it with quite a bang. I had a good time with floods, flamingos, sheriffs and the famous in Aggieville in the middle. Support the library and buy this book."
5,A Must Read for Kansans and K-Staters,"A best collection for all mystery short story readers. Aunt Merle rules as usual. And Aggieville is still ""The Place."" Almost 50 years since I attended K State, but the sounds and places all sound like it was then. Maybe a bit more crowded. As well, the vignettes of early Manhattan give the reader a glimpse of small town Kansas in the early years. And ""The Flood"" we had near where I'm from contributed to the flooding on the Kansas and Big Blue Rivers. Hourah, to all the authors of the Manhattan Mysteries."
3,Covers written Thai-to-English only; not English-to-Thai.,"This is an excellent and comprehensive dictionary, but the prospective buyer should be forewarned: it is for written Thai-to-English only. This is great for translating Thai writing. It is useless if you want to know the Thai word for ""cockroach"" or ""loneliness"" or any of the many thousand other words that you won't find in a tourist-level dictionary. It also leaves out any means of looking up Thai words by their pronunciation. Fortunately, the book is useful for me since I want to learn to read Thai; however, it leaves me still looking for a top-notch English-to-Thai dictionary."
3,Also known as the big green brick.,"If you are just beginning to learn Thai, or an intermediate learner, then this dictionary is probably not for you. Don't get me wrong, it is a great dictionary. But, if you are new to Thai, it is more than you will probably ever need. If you are looking for a convenient dictionary to use on a regular basis (and maybe something you can slip easily into your pocket or back pack) I would highly recommend one of the Dictionaries by So Sethaputra. (My wife, who is Thai, calls him the Webster of Thai Dictionaries.) His New Model Pocket dictonaries, are easy to carry and extremely easy to use. Mine cost me about four bucks at a University (where they teach Thai). If you buy them in Thailand, they are even cheaper than that. So, Get the Hass book for an good shelf-reference, but for practical use get one of So Sethaputra pocket dictionaries."
4,Fantastic Dictionary for the Serious Thai Speaker,"I agree with the other reviews! Useless if you want a tourist ""get-me-by"" quick reference. Incredibly useful -- in fact, a must have if you live in Thailand or develop any level of competence in Thai. I found the ""idioms"" particularly helpful when living in Thailand. This helped me truly communicate almost more than anything else I did. I would read a new idiom every day from Mary Haas, then ask Thai people how to use the idiom. I was astounded how many times those idioms were used and how much more insight they gave me into the culture and how much they improved my ability to communicate. If you're going to live in Thailand, don't leave home without it!The downside is that there is no way to look up a word in English and/or have a Thai person help you get the English word out of your head and turn it into something the Thais will understand. You will definitely need another dictionary for this."
5,MKs rock!!!,"The Mineral Kings invoke sounds of a time gone by with this release. In an era of every band fitting into a prepackaged consumer friendly format, it's nice to hear something original. I love the emotional roller coaster of this CD. It's not all happy songs or all depressed songs. It's more like life. A real record company would never put out a product like this, as it doesn't fit neatly into a marketing person's slot.Carv Tefft's throaty, masculine voice really pushes these songs. The driving drums, guitars and bass are original yet familiar. My only gripe is that it is only 10 songs."
2,Just Okay.,"Was hoping that this small book would be an exhaustive account of decision theory--all the theoretical evolutions (paradigms, theorists, etc) that decision theory stepped through. More likely to describe this small book as a large definition."
3,Too religious,Some of the book is helpful. But all of these books that talk about absent fathers are very geared towards religion and believing in God. If I don't believe in my father a living being it is very hard for me to be expected to believe in a male super natural being. I would really like to find one of these books that are just geared towards psychology.
3,Not impressed!,"The book itself is very good and healing from your relationship with your dad or even your mom, however the book its was in bad shape. It said online that it was in good condition however when I received it it had underlined markings all over the book, highlighted text and the book itself was very worn. Will not be ordering from this person again. My suggestion is look for a different seller, but buy the book."
5,This is the MICHAEL HAGUE illustrated version!,"There are many beautiful versions of this book, and I'm sure I'll eventually see all of the ones that people have reviewed here, but that cover you see up top is from the version illustrated by Michael Hague. I'm a little biased, but the book is really stunning: the artwork balances nicely between beautiful and frightening, and Andersen's original text tell's the Little Mermaid's simple story with a sensitivity toward her character that is rare in fiction written during the same period. While I'll admit that this book is probably best appreciated by children 6 years old and up, DO NOT insult your child's intelligence or maturity by thinking they can't handle a story in which the main character dies....the beauty of the story is in the the universal truth that love conquers all, outliving even death. What better lesson to teach children?"
5,Broil King Hot Plate Pro model,"We bought this item as an addtional burner durign canning season, and it works great. Hits quickly, high heat too, not the run of the mill hot plate. Cast iron and stainless steel makes it a breeze to clean."
2,HELP! WHO MAKES THIS PRODUCT!!??,"I CANNOT FIGURE OUT WHO MAKES THIS RANGE. THE PICTURE IS BROIL KING, DESCRIPTION IS CADCO AND A ""COPIED"" CADCO FLYER CAME WITH IT. BUT there is no name brand on it. I received NO receipt with the item and no contact info AT ALL. I am very disappointed and skeptical about this product and the way it was received. Although shipping was incredibly fast."
1,blown out fuses,this burner bleew out fuses in my house after 1 use. the outlet and other fuses in the house. Never again
2,slow to heat,"I put my canner on it and turned it to the highest setting, after an hour and still no steam I gave up and carried the canner to the stove eye and it steamed in a few minutes. Next try started with hot tap water in a large pot to boil and pour over tomatoes however after 1 1/2 hours still no boil but it did start to steam. I dont know if it is defective or just the way it operates but I would love to return it and get a refund."
3,"Cadco PCR-1S Professional Cast Iron Range, Stainless",Very well built but didn't work for us. We do alot of stir fry dishes and we can't get the heat to the level where we can stir fry anything. We had to return it for that reason.
4,Is good as it looks.,"The best multi purpose hot plate on the market,it is a Broil King in disguise. This hot plate realy does the job, it does take a long time heat 10 quarts of water but once its hot it does the job."
2,Low durability,"When I received these speakers, I was very pleased. They were easy to set up and connect, sounded great and the subwoofer was fairly strong - more than served the purpose of laptop speakers. However, after a couple months of use, not even on high volume, the subwoofer began to blow out and barely plays bass anymore. This may have just been my set of speakers, which is why I rated it a two. I'm not really that surprised at the low durability of these speakers, since they were so cheap, but I never thought I would lose them within a couple months."
5,good product,These speakers sound almost as good as my surround sound unit for my entertainment center.
5,Business Card Factory is really a good product!,"I found this to be a rather refreshing product to use. If you are using Avery card stock, all you have to do is provide the stock # off the box and it automatically sets up the format so it fits nicely on the card stock and doesn't run over and get cut off when you separate the cards.It took a little getting used to when I wanted to edit the cards, getting into text mode or object mode, but I have figured it out and now it is pretty easy to navigate the cards if you want to edit things you have done.I recommend this product to anyone who wants to make their own business cards."
5,Excellent software/works with Windows Vista,"The reason I bought it instead of a general desktop publishing program is that this includes a lot of customization and templates that general packages do not offer. Besides I don't need to publish brochures right now though I did in 1988 with other Desktop Publishing software on the Mac.This will work with Vista, even though it doesn't say it, if you download additional drivers from Microsoft called ""Windows Help (WinHlp32.exe)"" for Vista. An easier way would be to go to the novadevelopment dot com website and click support and look for the link.It works beautifully on Vista for me."
2,Not for professional cards,"I bought this package when I needed business cards fast. This package is not for a professional trying to make an impression. The cards are cute. There is limited ability to change format. If you don't fill in a box for a centered card, the type will be off center. The cards did print well."
4,didn't use it much,"a very capable program but I didn't use it much after I got it. not the programs fault, I just didn't need it."
3,it is OK,I think it is OK. But I have used other programs that were better.The price is Good and it has a lot of items to play with
2,Warning missing,"Methods described are fairly superficial, but accurate. Recommended schedule for maintenance too frequent unless tools are used professionally on a daily basis. Recommends cleaning virtually all tools with lacquer thinner, which is effective, but never mentions the safety hazards associated with this product, It is highly flamable, irritating to skin and eyes, is absorbed by skin, contains potentially cancer producing substances, and may cause injury to lungs, liver, kidneys and nerves. Lacquer thinner should be used only with proper protective equipment and ventilation."
5,Amazing Book,This book is like getting a book and a DVD. Amazing amount of information for a beginning guitarist to explore. The book is well organized and the on-line video etc... is well laid out. I found the videos showing the pitfalls of each chord type to be very informative. The strumming help files also help me coordinate both my hands. Highly recommended as a First Step for those of us just getting started on this cool instrument.
5,great!!,"This book is esential for players who need to know the 'why' and 'how' of what to do on guitar. Not only are essential theory and tips included, but most importantly(for the beginner) correct technique is covered.A must have!!"
3,"Decent book, but could be much better.","I bought this book with the intention of using it as a method book for my beginning students, assuming that it lived up to my expectations. It didn't. My first problem with this book is the huge amount of grammatical errors in it. This is unprofessional and is not something I would use for lessons for that very reason. Secondly, half of the book is taken up with rather difficult theory, which is beyond the level of understanding needed for the basic chord progressions introduced in the book. It isn't explained in enough detail either. Last but not least, I got pretty sick of seeing Mr. Arnold plugging his other products throughout the book. The book is already too short. There is no need to take up what little space there is with this type of thing."
4,Iits a romantic comedy made extremely well,"Yes, its a romantic comedy made extremely well and can safely be watched once.Vinay Pathak:: Seriously this guy needs no intros. He is just spot-on.Others do their part as per the demands.Going by the demands of the content, the movie is aptly based in London and the spirit is very well captured. Cinematography is of high standards and very much comparable to the likes of stalwarts viz. P C Sreeram/ Ravi Chandran.The screenplay is written and executed extremely well ensuring it binds the viewers at all times.The plot could have been completely linear. Jumping back and forth didn't seem quite right. Also the opening credits could have been more bland as opposed to the existing sci-fi touch.Special mention is deserved for the director Parvati Balagopalan who handles the reigns quite efficiently.Finally at the risk of being repetitive, should have been given more publicity - at the bare minimum it would fared better at the box-office in UK."
1,Cost,"The book is great, but the price is crazy. You can get the same book for $33 at Baltimore aquarium website. $ 200 plus r u crazy???????"
3,"Scales, Scales and More Scales","This book does exactly what it advertised - It shows fingerings for 10 different scales in 12 key signatures. That's fine, but I was hoping to learn how to use those scales while improvising - what chord structures does it work best with... that kind of thing. If you're looking for that info, keep looking. If you just want to know how to play all of these scales then, by all means, buy it!"
5,Fits my FM212R Perfectly,The only reason I needed a cover for my amp is because my cat likes to scratch at the mesh front of the amp and this keeps her off of it. Perfect solution.
4,Love and mystery.,Great love story with a dark mystery that kept the pages turning. The only reason I didn't rate it five stars is I wish there had been more detail about the time period.
2,It could have been better,The plot was okay. It kept my interest for the most part.My real issue with this book is the excessive flowery language throughout the book. It made it really tedious to read. I didn't need to constantly hear how Benedict's love was like sunshine and rain to her. It made me start skimming the book to get to the end. I had a good sense of the solution to the mystery but unfortunately I knew about it well before the climax of the book.
3,The not so tiny Fairy Queen,"I enjoyed this book about an impoverished but plucky and intelligent woman who dares to carve a brand new future for herself. On the way she restores man's good name, restores happiness for two grieving children and solves a murder mystery."
5,Beyond Passionate,"Excellent story of family, wealth, loss, secrets, control and the kind of passion your best dreams couldn't show you. You won't put this one down until it's done."
5,Excellent,This was the first book I have read by Jennifer St. Giles and she is now on my favorites list. She has a wonderful ability to create life like images with words. The plot was well thought out and complete. There are some love scences but I felt they were tastefully written and held a purpose to the plot. The characters are clear and defined. This book has a mysterious yet funny aspect to it. There was a perfect balance between romance and desire. Great read!
5,"Great Gothic, I can't wait for her next book!!","Like all of the other readers posting here, I had to stay up all night to read The Mistress of Trevelyan. The characters were thoroughly likable, especially the hero and heroine. I am eagerly awaiting Ms St. Giles next novel about Stephen. I am happy that so many other readers loved her as well. I can't praise Ms St. Giles highly enough. I started reading gothics when I was 7 and this book took me back to that very pleasurable place."
4,Try it.,"Wonderful main characters. Beautiful writing. Although the book bogged down in spots, its worth the effort, especially if you like Gothic. If you don't like Gothic, try this anyway, as it's set in San Francisco, and not in Jane Eyre land. Best scene is Benedict standing up in the tup. A little humour in a Gothic is always welcome. The secondary characters are terrific, especially the children. I've put it on my ""Perhaps I'll keep it"" shelf. I have and have read over 10,000 books. (Groan! Why do I do this!)"
2,boring,"I found this book extremely slow and boring. I can't see how the two main characters come to love each other when they spend so little time together. Titania's character is very annoying because on one side she's a self-deprecating person, while on the other side she's so sure about her convictions and skills as teacher and ""parent"", although she's neither of them. I also found difficult to believe that Benjamin hires her on the spot, knowing that she's not properly qualified for the job."
4,A Lost Civilization,This offers pictures and a brief overview into the Aztec world. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the Aztecs. I found out some interesting things that I hadn't heard before.
4,Dr Dolittel 4-Pack,Was a little disappointed as I thought 4 movies would come in 4 different sleeves but the movies were just fine and I loved them. I guess I need to read better when I read the discriptions ;o) I am pleased with the speedy shipment and the movies themselves.
1,Won't Buy Again,"It was no different than spraying water on my dog, didn't do a thing for detangling or softening the hair."
4,Great product for the price!!!!,"I bought this product a while back, and it worked great. All three of my cats had gotten really bad ear mites from being outside, but this took care of the problem. My cats hated getting the treatments. They fought back, and even tried to bite and claw. They didn't like it one bit, and they even avoided me after treatments for several hours. But the payoff is worth the aggravation. They have 100% healthy ears. I had taken to the vet to fix this problem before, but the mites had come back 1 month later. Not to mention it was outrageously expensive. We followed the instructions of this product to the letter, and the mites have never shown back up. It was also a lot less expensive than going to the vet. The cats seem much happier as well. I highly recommend this product."
3,"It's an effective product, but works slowly.",It does work. It just takes a while to get rid of those pesky mites. Expect weeks of treatment with a bad infestation. Many of the cats I rescue have severe infestations. Wish there was a better quicker remedy for their sake.
1,My cat HATED IT,"My cat hated it and still had mites. I thought She would go deaf and i had to take her to the vet. Such a big loss of money. Never do this again, next time VET!"
3,NOT Good for Vent Mounting,"Looks like this mount & cradle would work for dash mounting, but it's not that effective for vent mounting. Though a previous reviewer was able to make it work with a bit of clever thinking and an extra part, the vent mounting components are incompatible with the round vents found in new Jeep vehicles. THIS IS NOT THE MOUNT SOLD AS AN ACCESSORY FOR THE TOM TOM ONE!"
4,allis49,"Easy to install in standard floors.Looks great on the oak floor in the Quilt shop.Took me a longer time to install because I found I have ""5"" layers of floors in the 100 yr.old building-3.25"" thick."
4,A Good Start,"The author, David E. Petzal, is currently the Executive Editor of Field and Stream Magazine; as well as one of the funniest and most knowledgeable authorities on shooting and hunting.This book is a good, basic starter course in shooting and hunting with a .22 rifle, as well as care and 'feeding'. It was recommended to me by the author himself, whose best advice is also the most fun: Lots of practice! I only wish it had more information."
4,Some great scares,"All the films have great creepy scare factors. The quality of all the films, both in the video and audio departments are very good. Though it is advertised as a Triple Feature, there are four films featured.The Amityville Horror and The Legend Of Hell House are both scary and worth the price of admission alone.Poltergeist II, had potential to match the quality of the first movie, yet falls short due to apparent editing issues. The story is quite good. Though, the ending is slightly disappointing. Poltergeist III, is creepy and campy at the same time and is the weakest release in the Poltergeist trilogy."
5,crafts for all seasons,"I am very please with the book I ordered. I will enjoy sharing it with my two granddaughters, as they love crafts. The book arrived in good shape and in a reasonable time span. I will order again."
1,Travel Pillow Cover,This pillow cover is a waste of money unless you don't mind sandpaper for the material fabric. The fabric is so rough after laundering and wrinkled beyond recognition.Extremely disappointed!
3,Good Canadian Smooth Jazz!!,"This CD was introduced to me in August 2002 by one of the group's leaders, Andrew Scott. He sent me an email asking if I could consider his new CD for play and a review. I obliged and received the CD a week later. After listening, I noticed a couple of things. The CD has allot of smooth jazz influences, spanning the jazz horizon from Rick Braun, to fellow Canadian Brian Hughes, to David Benoit. I even heard a pinch of singer Phil Perry. Though the CD does have its ups and downs (I detected one song, ""I Love Music"", I that was somewhat bland but plausible), the overall recording quality is rock solid. I enjoyed listening to the tracks, ""Santa Ana"" and ""Dukish"" as it reminded me of my days living in the San Francisco bay area. Overall, it was a unique experience listening to the Clayton/Scott Group. I recommend it to anyone who wants a good, relaxing CD after a rough day at work."
1,sensor has extreme near vision- don't buy it,"I am disappointed in this sensor. It only picks up motion when you are close enough to throw the light switch yourself!It even takes longer to see me then it would be for me to turn on the lamp myself so what's the point of spending 15$ on this?For $12 buy one called sensor plug that is white and red. It can see me from 30 ft away and snaps on quickly EVERY time.Also The sensor alarm feature on this sylvania sa135 is also a joke since it can't see me to sound the alarm unless I walk very slowly within 2 ft of it, and even then it is unreliable."
1,Beware,"I purchased this timer because of the features. However, after just four weeks I heard a loud pop and saw smoke coming from it, fried. Of course its too late to return it. I'm just glad it didn't cause a fire."
1,Lasted less than the warranty,"But I didn't find the warranty / purchase info until after the year was up.Poorly designed, the cord for the light is up on the table, so it tended to pull the timer off the table. Quit working after about 9 months, I was too busy to look into it. Finally found the paper work today,First the light stopped turning on and off, even manually switching the device, not turning on. Today, the whole box was dead, hit the reset button, still not swithcing the light, but half the display is fouled up.Well done Sylvania.My first table top switch timer with the lamp cord on the wall ( from Radio Shack) lasted almost 25 years. Too bad they don't make that one any more."
1,Dead after a short time Do not buy,"I bought this just before I went over seas. It was working when I left, but when I return it had failed. The time is shown but the on/off and timed switches failed. Too late to return without a hassle. Only a few months old too soon to fail."
1,Failed after 4 months.,"4 months after buying it, it stopped working. It was nice while it worked but I'm very unhappy with the reliability."
1,Mine failed too.,Worked for two months then burned out. I took it apart and found very poor design. One of the three circuit boards is mounted such that the parts on that board are pushed up against the leads to backup battery housing. This eventually shorts out toasting the timer. Save your time and get one of the Leviton timers. There are much better built.
5,Truly Unique Music!,"These ""songs from within"" show John Chen to be a master of unique musical combinations. He mixes classical with oriental, spanish and other influences to create truly fascinating and original combinations. His use of unusual musical instruments adds to the complexity. Some cuts are haunting, some uplifting, but all are beautiful! Everyone for whom I have played this CD loves it! I'll be giving alot of ""Songs From Within"" for Christmas gifts."
5,Great series,This DVD brings the Bible Stories alive explaining the culture and taking us on a video tour. Wonderful!
3,missing part,I was supposed to receive a discovery guide with the DVD that was not contained with the DVD? Hard to run lesson with no guide
3,"Historically important, but you'll need another version too","Sadly the audio quality is abysmal on this recording of Holst conducting Holst, with some instruments barely being audible, and others sounding like they've been played through a sheet of tracing paper, with crackle and occasionally even scratch-like pulses adding to the assault.All of which is unfortunate, because from what I could hear, Holst's style is significantly different in many areas from that of most versions I've heard. It will be of interest to any serious fan of The Planets, and it's worth listening to once to get a sense of what Holst intended his music to sound like. But it's not a real alternative to a recent recording, and shouldn't be treated as such."
3,Interesting for an historical perspective,I rated this recording as three stars because the document itself is fascinating. The quality however is shocking. In preparing to conduct the Planets myself I fould some interesting answers to questions I had. Be sure to buy a modern day recording along side this one so you see the evolution. I think Bernstein/NY Phil is surprisingly close to the Holst tempi and energy.
4,Good I guess,"I can't say too much - I ordered the wrong one. I meant to get a PES50, not the 51. It's well built."
5,One of Connie's Best!,"""Rock 'N' Roll Million Sellers"" is just another example of the many facets of Connie's talents. Whether it's the rockin ""Heartbreak Hotel"", her own ""Lipstick On Your Collar"" or the classic ""Silhouettes"" Connie adds something to each song that makes them her own. If she was the first in the recording studio this album would have been titled ""Connie's Rock 'N' Roll Million Sellers."
2,I'll take the originals,"Its not entirely clear what exactly is the acheievement of this rather tepid colletion of, at the time, ""hit"" rock ballads. Certainly Connie Francis displays all the gusto one expects from her recordings, but this album lacks a conviction which exists with most of her other themed albums. Francis tackles each song with the best of intentions, but most of the tracks display nothing new in interpretation. With few excepetions, the sum of the parts come off bland and uninviting for more than a few repeat spins. Francis' classic ""Lipstick on Your Collar"" seems misplaced on this collection of forgettable tracks. For Francis interpretation at their early best, check out the re-issued MY THANKS TO YOU or WHO'S SORRY NOW."
4,Fantastic Book!,"James Dashner has done it again, only this time he did it even better. A Gift of Ice picks up where A Door in the Woods left off, with the Fincher family on their way to Japan to track down the mysterious book of the Givers and obtain the second gift. On their way, they pick up some new enemies, some whacked out motorcyclists who are bent on keeping Jimmy away from his goal. All along the ride, we are treated to the unique James Dashner voice and the Jimmy Fincher way of looking at the world. I enjoyed A Gift of Ice even more than I did A Door in the Woods, and that's saying a lot. I can't wait for the third installment. Type fast, James!"
2,Denso,I had order NEW and they send me remanufactured. The alternator was 90.00 bucks that was a great price. It said new in the discription. I would say if you are ordering anything PRINT OUT EVERYTHING because the web site changes all the time. MAY THE BUYER BEWARE!!!
5,College Physics,"The best and the fastest service. On top of these, the seller spent his own additional money( $2.61) for the shipping.Thank you Mr. John W. Carter. I and my daughter really appreciate you for this.God bless you."
4,competing in a crowded market,"Well, the artwork in the book is certainly gorgeous. A pleasure to read. But I am uncertain how distinctive the text really is, in providing any unique and advantageous insight to a university undergraduate struggling with a physics course.Which is not to say that the material is wrong or poorly written. Clearly, the authors have distilled a lot of effort into composing the text, and assembling a diverse set of problems and examples. Where these are often chosen to pique the reader's interest, by invoking real life situations that might be germane to her.The biggest problem this book faces is that there are several other long standing physics texts, now deep into their n-th editions. Mindshare is a difficult thing to acquire under these circumstances."
3,beware,"hey, notice it is only the second half of the book, equals second semester or phys 2b or something, i made the mistake of buying it and i needed part one... anywho"
1,Warning! This is *NOT* the libertarian John Ross...,"...who had written the brilliant novel *Unintended Consequences*, and whose political morality is diametrically opposed to that of ""...the American Left.""Amazon.com had better correct this mistaken impression ASAP."
2,Not designed for thick RV type wire cable,The plug is well made up to a point. It provides for using large gauge wire and there is an internal clamp for the 3 wires running inside the plug housing. There is however no way to provide strain relief for the thick outer cable the way this plug is designed. It needs a 1' long outer collar that clamps over the thick cable.It is a good replacement for temporary use until a permanent fix can be done.
4,Replacement RV Plug,"This connector is the only one I felt covers the connections adequately for outdoor use and it works well. It still does not seal out water well (at all), is a bear to assemble and only with some slight modification to the cover assembly would it fit under the cap on the side of my trailer. All that said I think it is the best alterntive on the market for a replacement plug."
3,"Honestly, I expected a better book!","I purchased the book having a little knowledge about PL/SQL programming and unfortunately reading this book didn't enhance my specific culture.Nevertheless I think that it is a good item for novice PL/SQL programmer. They will find it an unvaluable working and training tool.Finally, in my opinion, the preceding edition was richer in terms of contents and arguments."
3,I'd give her an A...,"...if this were a graduate term paper. It contains very poignant analysis of the common-day misconceptions about Billie Holiday, but isn't very persuasive in ""setting the record straight."" Whatever Griffin's goal, the book reads much more like a college paper, repeating itself at times and the thesis is pretty worn out by the end of the book. What I actually enjoyed the most about the book were the photos of Holiday. I would have appreciated more historical insight into Billie's life, and perhaps even more of a biographical approach. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a well-rounded representation of Holiday, this book definitely delivers."
1,Missed the Mark,"This is exactly the type of book I usually like -- a mixture of personal narrative, history, analysis, art -- but it just did not work for me this time. One learns a great deal about Billie Holiday and her place in jazz history, but that is often overshadowed by meandering commentary by Farah Jasmine Griffin (whose book on John Coltrane and Miles Davis is one of the best I have ever read). A straight biography of this mysterious singer probably would have been better."
2,Most overrated biography ever,"James Boswell wrote what is considered by many to be the greatest biography ever written. He does do an excellent job of describing to the reader what kind of person Samuel Johnson was, as he makes an artfully vivid portrait of his subject. However, it is unfortunately better art than history. It is factually inaccurate, painfully repetitive, and leaves the reader with little understanding of why Samuel Johnson was an important man at all."
5,informative and very readable,"Anne Rambo writes from the best possible perspective. Both mother and expert she gives clear information, and lots of it, in a readable and empathetic way. Her book is a pleasure to read. Ms Rambo gives detail and further contacts and lets us know our rights and responsibilities. She shows how other parents go through the things we do. She gives hope and practical ways to get through difficult times. Did you know you can request assessment for your child at any time and your school must respond? Did you hear of Wardolf schools? Anne Rambo gives all sorts of interesting information and has you feeling she's your own concerned expert."
5,My kids love this book!,"I have two young sons who are 3 & 4 years old. Everynight before bedtime, they get to pick out six books for us to read before they get tucked in, and everynight, this book is one they want to hear!We've gotten into the habit of me pointing at them when it's time and they get to say, ""I don't want to take a bath!"" And always, at the end of the reading, they tell me that they think it's funny that he doesn't like baths...because they LOVE bathtime! My 4 year old suggests that Little Tiger take a few floaty toys with him to the stream and he'll have even more fun.Wonderful book! I highly recommend it to all children! Not only is it a great message, but it allows the youngsters to become involved in the story."
5,Rio Bravo,"My husband and I absolutely love the Rio Bravo CD, we listen to it in the car to and from work everyday. The sound is very good. Thank you."
5,Totally Awesome,"Don't miss this concert event!!!!! Rascal Flatts gives you an awesome concert right in your own home. Great playlist of songs and plenty of live album twists. You'll love their rendition of ""Lean On Me."" This is a must my for all fans, young and old."
2,"If you own their other CDs, don't bother with this","Let me first say, I am a HUGE Rascal Flatts fan! Now, with that out of the way, this CD/DVD set is a great purchase for someone who doesn't own the other two CDs and/or hasn't seen the concert specials on TV, but if the aforementioned don't apply to you, don't spend the money... save it to buy their concert tickets next time they are through your town. There are only five songs on the CD, most of which are available on their previous CDs. Although their version of ""Lean on Me"" is beautiful, it's really not worth spending the money for one new song. Can't wait for the next new CD to come out..."
1,70's remakes???,I've only heard the cd but I must tell you it is laughable. With bad covers of boston and edgar winter. It's pathetic. I'm not a fan of the group but I know their stuff. Personally I think they wanna be Diamond rio. They are good live but a country vocal group remaking 70's guitar rock is a recipe for disaster and that's what you'll find here.
5,Simply Amazing,"I am an aspiring old finger picker myself and have met Doug at oneof his concerts. He absolutely loves to play and his skill is second tonone! I think this is his best CD yet and I own several of them. I onlywish he had put ""Order of Magnitude"" on the CD as that is my favorite.He won the National Finger Picking championship in Winfield KS this yearand it was rightly deserved. If you EVER get a chance to see him performlive, don't miss him."
3,Yawn!,I was hoping for better. The songs just weren't clean clear music - it sort of muddled through and was okay.
5,I've never come across a better fragrance,"Its really annoying to see people giving a 1 star review to an item based on the seller's handling and not on the quality of the product. Hermes Eau D'orange Vert is my personal favorite cologne. I am fussy with regards to scents, and I've always gravitated toward citrus because it is clean and natural... Despite being named orange, I smell lime more than anything else... There are 2 versions of Eau D'orange Vert from Hermes, this being the concentrate. It is not overpowering, but a little goes a long way. It lasts much longer than the dilute, which I use as an astringent, usually pouring some in my hands and applying it to my chin. This concentrate is much more of a cologne... use one or two sprays for a refreshing, invigorating, and clean smell. Don't buy unless you try it first, but put this label on your radar, because its a real gem among fragrances."
1,Old item,"***Did not receive Limited Edition!*** Sold by Amazon, ""S-C-A-M""Although the paperwork and ads and pics shown Limited which is why I bought it. I instead got an old bottle, old prints, too (there are more than one version to this Concentree) There were dust on the bottle. If you are looking for the limited edition bottle, don't bother dealing with Amazon, they're scamming consumers selling off old items for department stores. IF you do try to take a chance, good for you, but remember that buying from Amazon means there are no complains, no returns even if it's their own fault shipping wrong item to you.Awesome smells tho, this Hermes Orange verte. Last longer, woodier, classier than Eau Sauvage, even its Extreme edition."
3,An OK book but not what I like,"In my opinion, this book isn't so great. I am more interested in statistics, and this book focuses primarily on the game's history. That's not bad, but I felt like I already knew most of the information.The book also contains many typos, especially in the sidebars. The sidebars usually contain info that is also contained in the main text.If you already know alot about baseball, you probably don't need this book. If you're just learning or getting into the game, this book would be a good starting point. I don't recommend it for devout fans.."
3,What about bunting?,"I felt this book lacked necessary information on bunting statistics. I have a friend who bunted in the A.L., he was upset over how most statistical books ingore the art of bunting."
2,Sounds Cooler Than It Is,"Sounds awesome, doesn't it? Don't you imagine that you'll see a pop-up reconstruction of ""The Congress of the Elephant""? Unfortunately, the book is not constructed well, has few pop-ups to start with, and is distinctly un-pornographic.The things you wish would be popping up? They don't. No pop-up complicated sexual entanglements here.This book will only seem naughty to youngsters and folks who don't get out much --maybe even to older women who giggle when they see racy negligees at the mall."
2,Poorly made and with a lack of information,"I was greatly disappointed in this ""pop up""book.The lack of information and the actual design was a failure.I would strongly recommend having a CD with this book to make it of any value."
1,Flaccid Pop Flop,"I was very excited about this book. I'm sad to say it was a great disappointment. The premise had great potential as a unique, entertaining gift book perfect for couples. However, the six pop ups are not very complex and break easily. The text consists of excerpts, and is not as good a read as the complete original. Despite the book description, the pop ups do not represent the most unique and wildly acrobatic (sexual) positions chronicled by Sir Burton. I can only recommend this book for those with lots of spare change to spend on unusual (but rather mundane) books. Buy the original, and skip the pop up version."
2,Lousy as a pop up,"I bought it for the novelty of the popups. But the popups are lousey. Not one works like you think it ought. Such smart idea, poorly done. Text is nicely layed out but that is not why you are buying this book, to read, I am sure. Plan to be disappointed..."
1,Very disappointing as a pop-up and as a text book...,"I collect pop-up books, especially the unusual, strange and well-engineered. This book was sadly none of these. I wish I had read the review before adding to my wish list. Pop-ups are mundane, unimaginative and don't work well. Great idea, poor execution. I prefer the full text by Sir Richard Burton."
5,"OK, so it's a gift and I didn't open it up.",But doesn't it sound like fun? A elephant ride is featured. And a camel ride too. Need I say more?
2,William Aiken Walker:Southern Genre Painter,Fairly good review of this artist's work from cultural and historical perspective but not from the artistic point of view.Representative sampling of his paintings as B&W; and color photos but not a comprehensive listing.No indication of values and auction trends.My copy had considerable water damage and many pages suffered damage when separated.Unsatisfactory buying experience from Amazon.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Lyta Hall's son Daniel is taken from her. She shows that, when a superhero, she wasn't called Fury for nothing.Finding her mythological namesakes, she decides to put an end to Morpheus, the Lord of Dream. Morpheus is not without his own plans and defenses, however, but a promise made to a former servant costs him dearly."
3,Perhaps the most cryptic,"of a very cryptic series.The Sandman series, as a whole, is one of the outstanding achievements of comic art. The storytelling takes many forms, with varied styles of artwork chosen to carry each story in the best way.All those great features of the Sandman series come together in my disappointment in this volume. The artwork is jagged and graphic, the kind that expresses the sound of breaking glass but not much else. The story never really grabbed me, either. The ""kindly ones"" themselves refer back to many classic myths, but somehow never settled on one, or developed any of the traditional roles very strongly.I've been reading the collected volumes of Sandman out of order, and this is the only one I had left to read. I'm glad of that. If I had come across this volume first, I might never have pursued the others.//wiredweird"
2,"Great idea, poor performance","We've owned it for about a year and it already needs to be replaced. The rubber used for the gasket is flimsy causing leaks, the motor is underpowered for breaking up chipped ice causing the plastic gears to be stripped and the plastic ring the blades are mounted to cracked causing a huge leak. For the money we spent, I really expected more. I'm going back to my old Oster, at least it worked!"
1,Very cheaply made,"It is very difficult to unfold all the wired petals and leaves to make it look anything like the picture makes it look..... it looks totally cheap, and I am sorry I wasted any money on this. It is definitely not worth what they are asking for it."
3,Rather mundane,"I purchased this believing I would learn a great deal about Wilder's Lightning Brigade because the 123rd Illinois was one of the four regiments in this brigade. Unfortunately, Major Connolly's letters to his wife included little about any military matters because he was afraid his letters might be intercepted and read by the Rebels and in September 1863 he transferred to the position of inspector for the Division commanded by General Baird, so his diary contains boring administrative stuff. Also, the ""editor"" of the book, Paul Angle, added nothing in the form of explanatory footnotes to overcome these profound weaknesses. I really question why Indiana University Press decided to publish this book."
5,Cute!,"These boots are very cute and you can't beat them for the price, I would order either a 1/2 size or even a whole size up depending on what socks you are going to wear!"
2,"Sexy, but uncomfortable!!!","These heels are 4.5 inches and are so sexy, but I feel like i'm about to fall forward because they are so high for me. I feel like a ballerina and my ankles are stressed when wearing these boots."
3,"Super HOT, but very uncomfortable!","I bought these boots in black to wear with jeans for a sassy look, and they are indeed super sassy, but ther are super uncomfortable, too! The shaft is also a bit short for how high the heel is and it makes it very easy to roll your ankle over (and even fall!) I wear heels all the time, but rolled my ankle in these boots, luckily I caught myself before I fell *and totally embarrassed myself!!) They're great for the price (I think I paid only $30 something??) But they're more for looks, less for function!"
1,Hate 'em!,"These are by far, the most uncomfortable boots I have ever owned. They are so hard to walk in, and I was in so much pain within minutes of walking...they are also quite difficult to drive in. Like a lot of other people have said, they do run small, and the zipper in the back at the heel is the dumbest thing I have ever seen. If you don't have enough room they are impossible to zip up, and your sock will get snagged in it while zipping it up or down. The quality is okay, but not great. If you can find the Anne Klein Coe in black nappa or chocolate nappa, you will be much happier. They are the same style, but look even better and sexier than these, they are SO comfortable, run true to size, but are quite expensive...worth every penny though!"
2,Eh...,"They're not as great looking in reality, it looks a lot better in pictures. I sized up as recommended by other reviewers but they're still uncomfortable. The arch is just not natural. Great deal though!"
2,Sized smaller than true size,"Adorable boot and would likely be comfortable if sized right, but returned them and decided against the next size up. We cushioned inside. They are high... no doubt and very sexy looking."
1,Nothing but trouble,I've had nothing but trouble with this radio over the years. I'd say the XM portion of the radio has only worked for about 10% of the 4 years I've owned the device and have found customer support difficult to deal with.
2,"Very good, but has issues.","After a year mine had to go get fixed, I'm very glad that I paid for a 3 year extended service. The sw, and fm are good, but listening to am is terrible. While my E1 is at the factory being repaired I took out a Sangean 818 that cost me 10.00 dolars used at a swap meet, and has never had any problem after many years of use, I am also using a Sony 2010 that is about 10 years old and never given trouble."
1,Great design - bad display,"Apparently the giant display screen on this radio has major problems!$There are many, many unhappy buyers of this product!It could have been an excellent portable radio but, be prepared to return it to fix the display in a short time. If you don't buy it from an authorized dealer it will not be fixed under warranty. In other words don't buy off ebay, or second party used.The other major complaint I have, is the euro-trash external antenna hookup. I can't even explain this trash-mo design other than it's a push in affair (no threads) that sometimes connects and generally comes loose if you move the unit around. Very bad selection for antenna connection! This radio could have had a giant bar antenna for MW AM frequency but failed on this point also.I would not recommend this radio because of the continued, and increasing number of failures in the display screen which renders it blind!"
1,Eton's quality is terrible,"Over the years both my E1s have had multiple component failures and the rubberized coating on the cases has turned to goo. Even when the components work, the amount of noise coming off the display is extremely high. I honestly can't recommend the E1 or any other Eton product to anyone."
4,"Controversial, sexy & interesting","Story of a sex-crazed alcoholic and selfish assistant adminstator in the congo. Breaking mans law, jungle law and marital laws. His adventures as he supposedly helps control and aid the natives. Some slave and racial issues are brought out."
