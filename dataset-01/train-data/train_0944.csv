5,Love it!,Great organizer bag for your SUV/Mini Van/Car. The velcro at the bottom of the bag really keeps it in place and prevents it from sliding around. The zipper closure also keeps the contents private. I highly recommend this bag.
2,Hard to understand,"This book is very complex and difficult to understand. I had to read it for my ap us history class and I barely could follow it. I reccomend Up from Slavery instead, it is more entertaining and easier to understnad."
3,o.k. read,"its good to read this for the knowledge but it wasn't a page turner or nothin. it seemed to me like he was begging whitey to love and accept black people. i know he changed his strategy later tho, so its interesting to see the way it was back then compared to the way it is now."
4,Souls.,"This book is great for study if you're majoring in African American Studies.I don't know if it speaks for all African Americans in this day and age, but and interesting dissertationnone the less."
2,"Well-written, prescient, and anti-Semitic","I'd give this book four stars if not for some very troubling anti-Jewish passages in the text. To be fair, they are scattered, and anti-Semitism isn't DuBois' main point in the work -- which, as others have said, is astonishingly accurate in its predictions of the problems facing citizens of the 20th Century.All the same, it unsettled me to read DuBois make eloquent pleas for black equality while almost cavalierly dropping Jewish stereotypes into the narrative.Good book, but be warned. (Did DuBois abandon these stances later in life?)"
3,Souls of Black Folk,"This item was received at the absolute maximum allotted time. Also, the pages were marked much more than expected from the description. Wish it was in better condition."
1,Kindle Fire,"Please note that the Kindle Fire is nothing like advertised.It is not what it is hyped up to be.My son purchased the KindleFire for me because of the touch pad, icons,Email, Internet, music... all features that he thoughtthat I would enjoy. These features would be excitingif the access was easy. The screen does notreadily respond to your commands, the on/offbutton is in the most peculiar place so the machinecan easily be turned off, the screen shifts tohorizontal without your movement, tapping thescreen sometimes gives no results...I still prefer my old Kindle with no features.Amazon should allow us the opportunity toreturn the Fire, at no expense to us, until theirprogrammers can do a better job.I am really disappointed with the product andwould recommend it to no one.Most disappointed; will recommend it to no one."
4,Review of Bedford's DuBois,"This volume includes the Souls of Black Folk, and also a few other essays by DuBois. The introduction to the subject matter is almost as inspiring as DuBois himself. One drawback- the text is accompanied by endnotes rather than footnotes, which is rather problematic because Dubois' frequent references to very specific classical literature call for frequent trips to the back of the book."
4,The Souls of a Fallen People...,Mr. DuBois gave a harsh reality on the struggles of the African American people. He left no stone unturned and no points missed.
4,Nate's Mom,"I purchased Souls for an assignment; it arrived quickly and is quite the page turner. At $2.50, this book will be far more valuable to my son (in 10 years or so). I would have preferred hard cover to ensure greater preservation. Its uncanny the similarities with Du Bois and your new president. This should be recommended reading in every American school especially since you are about to experience history in the making."
2,don't understand it.,This is a very hard book to read. I'm not sure how it was written. It's not in a language I understand.
3,The Souls of Black Folk,The book had some very interesting sections but is a tough read. It is a very important topic and am glad I read it
2,Short Circuit,"When I put the batteries in, the holder for the batteries caused a short circuit. I'm lucky I didn't just leave the batteries in when it didn't turn on, because the battery case had already melted from the heat. Luckily I have some electrical background, and was able to bend the part of the case that was contacting the base causing the short. Once I fixed it, it worked fine."
4,Stable Platform,"I used this product in a Toyota Landcruiser to mount a Sony HDV camera. It would also be well suited for a DSLR still/video setup. It provided a solid platform and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it can make exiting the vehicle quickly a little difficult, depending on the vehicle and how you set it up."
4,A really awesome case,I'm not going to go on and on about the features because it's just a case. I'm just telling you why I put 4 stars instead of 5. I like to put the booklets in the sleeves along with my CD's. This case doesn't hold both of them very well; some of the sleeves are on the verge of ripping. I guess I shouldn't push their limits though.
5,Mises The Theory of Money & Credit,"An excellent, and scholarly read; of the monetary policy behind the fiat money system. It explains how political agendas create monetary bubbles and busts. If everyone understood the information contained in this book; politicians and central bankers would be unable to produce the massive Ponzi Scheme, we now know as the current monetary policy, of most Western countries."
5,Must read if you want to understand our current economic disaster,"This is an excellent introduction to the understanding what is ""money"" and why government-mandated money (such as the dollar of today) inevitably leads to inflation and the consequent destruction of savings, capital, and ultimately society. It is a bit anachronistic in parts, but generally is well written and easy to comprehend. Why is gold at $1850+ right now? Read, to find out. You will regret not having done so $1000 ago.After digesting this, read Human Action, and you will have the scales lifted from your eyes. If you read the works of only one economist, read Ludwig von Mises."
3,"Great book, missing sections!!","In chapter 8, the last two sections are missing! Also, the formatting wastes space, paragraphs aren't indented, but have a space between them. And the pages are 8.5/11''."
2,The Theory of Money and Credit,The Theory of Money and Credit.This book is anti-communist propaganda. It isn't the scholarly study of economics that the title would suggest.
1,Horrible Formatting Makes This Kindle Version Unreadable,There appear to be two Kindle versions of this book. I am referring to the one that the cover image is just block lettering inside a box with no graphics or pictures of any kind. The lettering is green and the background is gray when viewed in color.
3,Miller's last gasp as a major artist,"""Abracadabra"" was Steve Miller's last chart hit (and a number one, at that). The album of the same name was the last Miller album actually worth owning. Miller is known for his blues stylings, but ultimately he is a 1970s era classic rocker at heart. With ""Abracadabra,"" he attempted to insert some new wave flourishes into his music, with mixed results. After the big hit, the album's other highlights include ""Keeps Me Wondering Why,"" ""Give it Up"" and ""Cool Magic."" Nothing of great consequence, but then again Miller's albums were more about having fun than thinking real hard.Overall, ""Abracadabra"" is far from being Miller's best album but might be worth owning for ardent fans."
4,Not Bad,"While much of this album is not Steve Miller's best work, it is certainly ok, I got this album, mainly for the songs ""Keeps Me Wondering Why"" and the full length version of ""Abracadabra"". The rest of the songs are not quite as good, but they aren't terrible, either. Of course, if you are a die-hard Steve Miller fan, you will want this, the casual fan probably wouldn't want this."
3,Awesome title track!,"The title track from this CD was one of the best, most catchy pop songs from 1982. And the version on this CD is a little bit longer than the version that got released as a single. But the rest of the album is pretty bland. There's nothing on here that's awful or horrible or anything like that. But compared to the title track, the rest of the disc is a big disappointment."
5,Columbian CO170 (#10) 4-1/8x9-1/2-Inch Poly-Klear Left Window White...,exactly what the ad says & in great / NIB conditonwill buy again when neededhope this helps you
1,Envelopes arrived with flaps already sticking to backs,Envelopes arrived with flaps already sticking to backs. Must have been stored in a very humid warehouse.
3,Bizzaare,"Breathing and Baboshka I like, but I have a hard time getting into this one. It may grow on me though"
3,An Early Foreshadow Of Genius: 3 1/2 Stars,"An early indication of the genius that Kate Bush would become. The Lyrics speak with wit, ecocation, and provocation: repressed paedophilia and death from radioactive fallout are examples of the weird and varied sources Kate can seamlessly draw from. The music itself is sometimes a drawback: although it is obviously more layered and textured the experimental whims are sometimes caught in the stylistic trappings that defined her earliest work. This means that some tracks don't work as well as they should and others are just lightweight and boring. Still, there are mammoth songs here that provide far more than just cold comfort consolation.Best Tracks: Beathing, Babooshka, The Infant Kiss."
4,Kate develops,"Kate could write a great song, that we knew. On Never Forever she reinvents herself; Breathing and Delius show a more experimental Kate without losing the feel of earlier great work.Babooska and Army Dreamers show another example of her emphasis for feelings. For some too sweet, but they are for real and that you can hear. The forementioned songs are great but not all are of that same level. So not a 5 star."
3,"Savateur and the ""Old Shoe""","Savate fighting is a French martial art of extremely efficient unarmed combat which uses the hands and feet as weapons. It is somewhat similar to karate with graceful and elaborate kicks, which are less rigid than the karate fighter's. As well, the striking methods closely resemble those of western boxing. At the time of publication this was the only book written in English on this fighting form, and for as old as this book is, it was and remains a credible text for historical study and practical how-to application."
4,My Epiphany,"It's amazing how many obscure tales of terror and hope lie in the shadowed corners of history. As they say, the past can be forgotten but not erased."
4,Good factual information about the White House,"This is a very interesting book about how the White House operates and the key offices under the jurisdiction of the White House. Bradley Patterson fills his book with insight and information, yet the book is still very readable and anything but boring. This is a non-fiction account of the White House and its offices. It is not a biography nor is it one persons account of his year's in the White House. It is very much a factual account of the daily workings of what takes place in government. This is a very interesting book that I would recommend for people interested in learning more about government. It is also a very good resource for those who are doing research on the inner workings of the White House."
5,Encyclopedic yet Engaging,"An excellent, encyclopedic account of the modern White House. Patterson manages to give a lively description of how the White House works, while consciously avoiding all but the most serious and relevant topics concerning the White House. A must-read for anyone interested in the administration of the modern White House"
4,An Insider's View of the White House Office,"This book was informative, engaging and very revealing. Patterson systematically unveils the various departments and duties of the little recognized White House Office. Although it is a long read, the knowledge gleaned from this book is practical and valuable."
3,It's ok,I ordered this product for my wife. It is larger than I expected. The quality is ok. I'm not sure if I will order this type of jewelry without seeing it in person first.
5,Excellent,In-depth history concerning greece and the near east in the years after WW1. Very relevant to the situation to current Yugoslavia.
2,Political corretness takes way from classic.,"I was disappointed in the politically correct version of this classic. I agree that this black stereotype is not true today, but I also feel that the original stories are part of the black and white history of our country."
2,Opum By Yves Saint Laurent,"I don't think it is the original eau de toilette. I have been using this product for a long time and I can see the difference. I use it every day and in the past people used to ask me all the time what perfume I was wearing. Now, I can not smell it and it doesn't stay in my body."
1,opium spray,I returned the package to seller and recieved credit except for S/H and my return costs. Reason for return-the spray was a weak scent of something other than what I ordered.
4,OPIUM BY YVES SAINT LAURENT,I received this product in a timely fashion. This is my favorite perfume and I was pleasantly surprised with the price.
4,Review of opium scrnt,"The product was known before purchasing from Amazon. Because of fair price, no shipping charges and no tax, I chose to purchase online."
1,Very disappointed with this Amazon purchase,"Same complaint as other buyers of this expressed. Not the product I ordered and paid for!!!! I ordered the 3.3 oz bottle for $63.45 + shipping and received a 3.0 oz bottle listed for $57.50. This was a Valentine gift for my wife, she like others says it is a different fragrance from her existing bottle of Opium. Even I could smell the difference!!!!The company shipping this fake product, TUCCNI, makes no provision for return, stating it is a hazardous material, what a JOKE.I fault Amazon for connecting themselves to a FRAUDULENT company such as this.Shame on you Amazon."
1,New Opium sucks!,I've worn Opium for over 25 years. I'm very disappointed that they've changed the formulation. If it ain't broke ... don't fix it. Returning it .... I want my money back!
2,Incorrect fragrance,I wanted the bottle of Opium shown in the picture. I received the new bottle. The latter is too strong for me.
3,Opium For the Ladies,Personally this smells like a girl version of Old Spice. BUT if you purchase it from the actual website it smells slightly different and it lasts longer than say you purchase it from amazon.
3,Not a good choice for beginners,"I read the reviews of this video and then bought it anyway because I'm not a total beginner and thought I would be bored with a lot of simplistic breaking down of moves and easy patterns. I was wrong! This is too hard for beginners of any level, even if you already know the basic step and a few turns. Most of the combinations are really complicated, and they provide only brief instructions.The meringue section is a little better because the patterns are short and a lot easier to catch onto, but they offer no instruction for that section, just demonstration."
1,NOT GOOD AS A TEACHING AID,"This video was a huge dissapointment for me. I want to learn salsa, but this video does not break down and label the steps. Sure, it teaches you great combinations, but when I teach these combinations to students in my physical education classes, I won't know the names of the steps. If she had told us the names of the steps and broke them down for us, this video would have been great."
2,Horrible for Beginners,"As a beginner I am now taking salsa lessons and still very disappointed with this video. As per this tape if you're a beginner stay away. Good instructors always count ""1,2,3,,5,6,7,"" while showing you the exact steps/footing. As an instructor Jose Neglia doesn't even know how to count - she says ""quick, quick, slow,,quick, quick, slow"". Not only is that really bad instruction, she furthermore often loses the tempo when she says ""quick, quick, slow"" which confuses the beginner even more. One more thing, she instructs the dance steps very quickly ""quick, quick, slow"" then demonstrates it very quickly. If you are a beginner there's no way you'll enjoy this tape."
5,Great book written with honesty and insight,"I think that this is one of the best books I have ever read, period. Not just about dogs. The book is written very simply and clearly. It is also written with out fear or favour for political correctness but with just the dog's welfare and their needs in mind, so that you can have a well trained dog. Please do not listen to the people who are crying hoarse because of the discipline portion of it.I am a Hindu and when I read this book , I could feel the earnestness and love with which this book was written. The monks seem to have a natural understanding of the dogs which has to come out of a natural and complete understanding of oneself.The book is about how you can give what your dog needs to make it feel better and have a fruitful and happy life and not about what you or the media think they need to make you feel better.I hope I have the opportunity to meet these monks."
5,Excellent book,"I just finished this book and found it to be a well organized and thorough treatise on the subject. Those who say the book focuses too much on punishment must not have read the latest edition. The monks no longer recommend the alpha roll and ""strongly discourage its use to our clients"". Rewards are used as the primary means of training. Punishment is only recommended in certain severe situations.If you really want to learn about your dog and your relationship with your dog, buy this book. I loved it."
2,"outdated, wrong, harsh","This book presents the state of the art in dog training dating back to about 1975. The techniques are based on punishment, not building a positive relationship with your dog. The techniques will work with SOME dogs, but you will get better results with all dogs by using more modern techniques based on a better understanding of how dogs learn. Check out books by Pat Miller, Patricia McConnell and Jean Donaldson, for a start."
2,can be too harsch for some breeds and temperaments,The methods in this book will work on many dogs but be dead wrong for certain temperaments and breeds. It is WAY to harsch for my soft goldens.
2,The trouble with dominance...,"Although they have a lot of good things to say, their whole idea of absolute dominance over your dog is unnecessary and potentially incredibly dangerous. The shakedown and alpha roll-over should pretty much never be done, to any dog. These techniques can emotionally and physically damage a submissive dog, not to mention break down your trust relationship. Done to an aggressive dog, it's just asking for trouble. I would much more recommend Patricia McConnell's ""The Other End of the Leash."" The obsession with dominance (usually meaning aggression) is not good for anyone involved in dog training."
3,"Great book if you're raising your puppy from the beginning. Otherwise, give consideration...","We bought this book hoping to garner some tips for retraining our pound adopted seven month old Pyrenees/Golden Retriever mix. That's not what this book is about.I don't want to shortchange the authors, we did garner some solid tips on overall behavior and general training techniques from the book, especially in regards to the `sit/stay', 'no jump' and 'no bite', but I think the book falls short and is not intended for the occasion when it comes to the retraining aspects that may be necessary for a 'pound dog' (I hate to call Ari that, but that's how we got him and how he behaved when he entered the family circle). This book has lots of great reviews and I'm sure deservedly so for the intended audience, but consider others if you're not raising a puppy from day one, especially if it's not a German Shepherd or like breed."
5,Trainers Bible,"I am a Master Trainer and have been raising and training German and Dutch Shepherd working dogs for over 25 years. I train patrol, protection, detection and companion dogs and I recommend the ""Monks"" to every new client I work with.Dogs are Gods greatest gift to mankind. These books show people a ""compassion based"" training paradigm that not only produces real and long lasting results, but helps to facilitate a lifelong understanding of communication with your dog. Whether you have or are looking for a companion or a working service dog, this is a must read set of books!"
4,"Well written, if poorly laid out","I hadn't read this in 15 years, since the last time I trained a puppy. THis updated version changes some things. I still appreciate the philosophy of the monks, and think this a valuable resource, but as a training manual, which I understand is not its primary mission, it needs to be reorganized."
5,How to be your dogs best friend,"Excellent book easy to follow,giving direction to train and handle your dog.Direction are exacting easy to follow, the book has been a big help in understanding and training our new pup."
1,don't get this book if you want to be kind to your dog,"a well-meaning friend gifted me with this. I wouldn't even give it away--I am recycling it. Don't want anyone to read it and be misled about how to train your dog. Sadly the monks take a disciplinarian approach to dog training based on a disproven idea that you need to dominate your dog and be the alpha dog. Instead of this book get ""Culture Clash"" which is a positive approach to dog training-NO CRUELTY involved and my dog behaves beautifully!!!"
1,I wish I could give this book zero stars.,"If you hit your dog, you are abusing your dog. Plain and simple. Cut and dry. To discipline means to teach - not to hit! Hitting is not disciplining. Animals are ours to love - not to abuse. Please do not purchase this book. Buy something that encourages a mutual relationship of respect between you and your dog."
4,Infomation For My Best Friend,This is a good and very informative book. I am looking forward to working with my dogs using this information.
5,How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend: The Classic Training Manual for Dog Owners (Revised & Updated Edition),Glad a friend and a dog owner recommended that I buy this book to read. Lots of great ideas and tips on what to and not to do.
5,Excellent Resource!,"I have never owned a dog before, needed an overview of what to expect and how to prepare my home and family for a new dog. Very very informative, excellent resources on what it means to bring a dog into your home, how to prepare for your new family member, and how to get basic training started. I also purchased their book: The Art of Raising a Puppy, which is a great in-depth details if you are bringing home a puppy. I loved them both!"
2,"not a complete waste of time, but close","read it if you want, but please read Kilcommons's book first. The monks don't expand their ideas--the book is mostly an overview of concepts instead of teaching techniques step by step. I respect anyone who can train a dog effectively; however, I don't agree with their ""hands on"" approach."
2,More boring than a three hour wedding,Do not waste your money on this book. The monks apparently like to hear themselves talk and talk and talk. The big problem with this is that there is very little information in all the stories they tell that can help you directly with your new dog.
1,If you enjoy hitting....,"If you enjoy hitting and dominating your beloved best friend, then you need to read this book. I only got to about page ten and all I had to read was how you should hit your dog, and the hand that feeds him should be the hand that hits....I was very disappointed...I suggest the Dog Whisperer...he is ALL about non violent training and living with your best friend. Not even one violent outburst needed. I have a very stubborn, adopted at 8 months, many issues here, 150 pound Rottie. He has an attitude of, I can't even think of a good comparison...but, the methods of the Dog Whisperer, and yoga has turned this dog around. He went from breaking 8 windows in my house to sitting calmly beside me while doing yoga. I swear to God! It was very easy too! If you want a copy of this Monk's book let me know...oh wait...I forgot that I threw it right away. I am glad that I bought the cheapest,used one I could find, and it wasn't even worth that much!"
1,Negative 5 stars!,"Just so neigh to New Skete!I am ashamed to admit that 8 years ago I used to recommend this book. With all of the new positive dog training knowledge and techniques, I am astonished that it still sits in Amazon's best seller list. DO NOT buy this book! The monks' techniques are primitive and crude. The scruff shakes and alpha rolls are among the many things that are just not necessary for daily training and are not building blocks for a healthy relationship with your dog. Your dog will learn to fear you, not respect you...so I ask...what's the point in having a dog? If only I had known of Jean Donaldson, Karen Pryor, and Ian Dunbar when I started training my dogs, I would not have the burden of guilt that I do today."
4,I was pleasantly please,"The first thing I noticed about this book is how the Monks start right away as ""REAL"" people who are not trying to sugarcoat the readers eyes with what you expect to read. They have a honest, different approach to training your dog with methods that will not agree with everyone. I believe their techniques are very helpful to anyone who has a larger breed dog but has limited training and behavioral information on the toy breed owners. Even though I have a toy breed, I found that some information in this book was helpful and very resourceful."
5,Excellent Investment,"If you are serious about learning how to live with your dog, this book is an excellent investment. I'd purchased it years ago when it was first published. I currently teach advanced obedience classes and recommend this book for all my students. There is something in there for everyone at all stages of dog training."
4,Breeder said this is great,I got this bc we are new to dog ownership and lucky enough to get a breed that is hard to get and needs some dog knowhow to have. So we got this. It's useful but some of the practices are outdated and it's pretty GSD heavy but that's cool.
4,The flaps open the wrong way!,"We have One Yellow Lion where the flaps open the opposite direction of the way you'd turn a page, and I thought this would be similar. But, the flaps open just as if you're turning a page. Granted, my son loves turning pages, so for him, this book is perfect. It was just different than what I expected. I'd recommend this book only to kids who can't sit still for more than a few seconds without wanting to turn the page of the book, as they get to turn twice as many in this so-called lift the flap book!"
2,Not so great.,"Not one of Eric Carle's best. As usual, the illustrations are fabulous, but the story didn't interest our littleone."
2,Skip it!,"My toddler loves the board book version of this book so I thought this book would be fun for her. The flaps are awkward and frustrating for a 16 month old. The flaps are so large it's just like turning regular pages, so why have the flaps?"
1,Poor,"Poor, the book was 3 inches by 3 inches and this was never indicated on the site. As a teacher I couldn't use it and had to spend more money and buy another one from scholastic books. Not a happy camper!!!"
3,Just OK,"Review by Sherry North, Author, Because You Are My BabyEric Carle is a favorite in our house, but this is one of his weaker titles. The illustration of the spider spinning her web barely changes from one page to the next, and there's no clever twist that ""makes"" the book, like in A Very Hungry Caterpillar. After reading it to our son once, he never seemed interested in looking at it again - but he does ask for Carle's other books often."
4,Very busy spider,"Perfect for the preschool set. All five of my grandkids love this book. Helps mitigate the ""look, a spider...let's kill it"" response to bugs."
2,It's not a lift the flap book.,I purchased this book because I had read the hard cover and thought a lift the flap version would be interesting. I still really like the story but this is a very poor rendition of a lift the flap format.
2,disappointing....,VERY SMALL! I expected this book to be much bigger. great for little ones except that it is st risk of being torn bc the pages are thin paper
2,CHECK THE SIZE FIRST,"This is one of my children's favorite books. We have read it many times and so when I needed to order a gift for a little boy I went for this one. I was shocked when a little 3x5"" book arrived. Yes,that is my fault for not checking. But I also think the title should say ""mini book"" or have the size in the title. When selecting ""hardcover"" from the version choices I assumed it was the full sized one. Especially when the price is the same.Great book. Just check the size before ordering. I am disappointed and cannot return at this point because the party is tomorrow. :("
1,Too Small,"I was very disappointed when I received this book. It was not clearly indicated that the book was 3 x 5 inches in size. I expected a full size hardcover. I want the larger size, but you will not have my business."
2,"I LOVE this story, HATE this version","This is one of my son's favorite stories. He smiles as we point out each animal and he always sits still through the entire book. I bought this copy as a gift for a friend's new baby along with several other favorite children's book. Maybe I should have been able to pick this up from the listing, but it is TINY. It is not the nice sized board book we know and love. It is a hardback with paper pages. There is no way we'd be able to read this one any time soon and I think the size would take away from the lovely pictures. Very disappointed!"
3,This book is tiny,"The story is ok--my daughter seems to enjoy it at 17 months of age. However, the book itself is tiny. If you want this book, I'd suggest finding it in a regular format and not the miniature version."
4,An Industrious Spider Achieves Success,"This story starts when a strong wind blows a spider from her web on a tree to a barnyard fence. The hard-working spider does not complain about bad luck, or ask other animals to catch flies for her. Instead, she immediately starts spinning a new web.Then, animal after animal come by asking her to do something else. In each case, however, the spider doesn't reply. ""She was very busy spinning her web,"" the story explains. By book's end, the spider has caught a fly and is sleeping soundly after a long day's work.In working hard to achieve again what was lost, despite persistent pleas to do other things, the industrious spider is both enjoyable to read and educational--without being preachy. Anyone looking for a readable book that shows the value of being virtuous should enjoy this book."
3,Pro: Talks about animals; Con: Lame flaps,"It goes through all the farm animals: the sounds they make and what they do. My 4-year old knew all this but my 2-year old benefitted. The flaps may as well have been pages since they're almost the same size as the page and open in the same direction. I think flap books should be more interesting. Overall, it's a cute basic book."
1,The very busy TINY spider!,"I thought I was ordering the full-sized version of this classic book for use in my classroom! However, what I got was an incredibly small sized version of the book! There is NO WAY I can use this as a book to read to my students! Wish this had been disclosed when I made the purchase!!!"
1,Size of book disappointing,I was disappointed when this book arrived and it was so small. I did not see any indication that this was such a small book. I bought it for a gift because I already own the board book version and love the story.
1,Boring and repetitive,"I love Eric Carle's art and several of his other stories, but this one is really boring and repetitive. There's not enough variety to the images, the spider comes across as a real pill who has no interest in other creatures, and the story line is dull. Skip this and go for the chameleon or caterpillar or polar bear."
2,Travel size?,"I was disappointed that this book is so small. It has double-ply pages, making it sturdy for little hands, but it is so tiny! Maybe it will be a good book for travel."
2,Great condition but didn't know it was sooo incredibly little.,"The book was in great condition! However, it didn't tell me how little the book was and when I got it in the mail it was very tiny. Too tiny for all 26 of my kids in the class to see. Maybe mention if the book is small or not next time??"
4,teeny tiny book,"My wife bought this one without realizing the actual size of the book. We love reading to our little guy so we wanted to stock up on books and well, this one is great for travel, but not one I read to him at night on a regular basis. Throw it in the car, your diaper bag, etc, it does fit nicely, but before you buy pay attention to the size of the book... still a good book for kids."
4,Loved the story but ...,Lift the flap books are often made of durable or heavy paper. This is not. I bought it for a one year old. I read it with her but no sure if it will survive. The good news is that it a darling story and she loves all the animals inside.
2,This is a mini book!,"I was so looking forward to giving this to my toddler nephew, but very disappointed when I received it. The mini size (4"" x 5"") should be included in the initial description, not buried under ""dimensions"" at the bottom Though I love the story, this is not the one to read with a kid on your lap."
5,The Very Busy Spider,This was a story about a spider that spins a web without allowing itself to be distracted by the other farm animals. Its theme is starting a job and finsihing it and how a simple creation can become beautiful.Note to teacher: This is a multisensory book greeat for tactile learners. It discusses the different farm animals and the sounds they make.It has repetitive text.The book also talks about the different jobs that animals have.
2,Book much smaller than expected,"I was surprised to find such tiny print in a book for little ones. As a teacher, I really couldn't use it."
3,Not as Colorful as Expected,Cute story but way too much white space and the muted animals were not that interesting to my grandson. The flaps present no challenge and the fact that this is not a board book would give it a short shelf life if he bothered reading it more than once. This one was phoned in and not up to the colorful standard of other Carle favorites.
3,Great story but book is SO TINY!,"Just a quick note - I didn't see that anyone before me had mentioned it. This is the MINIATURE version, which I didn't realize until I opened my box to find it. $7 for that?!? Seems pretty pricey. When I finally reviewed the listing I saw that they do say it's a mini-version. So...what can you do? Just be warned, this is a small, small book!"
3,"Great Book, But This Is The Mini Version!","We quickly received this book directly from Amazon and it has great illustrations and storyline. Unfortunately, this is the mini version of the book as it is only 5""x4""x0.5"", which therefore made it difficult to appreciate this fine work of art."
2,Publisher's Mini edition???,"Shame on you Amazon!! This version of the book is tiny,tiny,tiny, only 3in.x 3in.. This was not indicated in the general description. The only place it was indicated was in the publishing details and I did not see that until after receiving the tiny book in the mail. Will know that I need to read even the fine print next time!"
5,An overlooked classic western.,"I had never seen this movie until recently and was surprised that it hasn't been shown more often. It is intense and suspenseful. The actors are well-cast and help make this a believable film.If you like the typical ""shoot 'em up"" type westerns, you may not like this movie. It focuses on the shifting relationships between the various characters while in a tense situation. It reminded me a lot of ""The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing"", which is another great film.My only complaint - take off the darn spurs!"
4,A great movie.,"This Western is a secret treasure. I'm so happy to find it on amazon. Gregory Peck plays a scout who has been working for the US cavalry. It's pretty much a mop up operation now toward the end of the Indian Wars. He's been involved with the cavalry's escort of women and children and elderly people to a reservation and now he's done and looking forward to retiring to his cabin in the foothills of the rockies. A white squaw played by Eve Marie Saint approaches him and asks for further escort for herself and her half-breed son. Reluctantly, Peck acquiesces. Well, it turns out that the boy's father is just about the baddest renegade chief ever and he starts coming on like the Terminator to get his son back. Peck, who's hatched a hankerin' for Saint (who can blame him!) resolves to stop him. Hold on to your saddle horn, pardner, 'cause man, it gets intense. You never see the Stalking Moon coming but you always know where he's been. Just count the bodies. Great movie!"
5,Great movie--DVD missing scene selection,"Wonderful movie! I loved the way the silence brooding over the Southwest landscape is reflected in the film: in Varner's strong, stoic character; in the taciturn scowl of the Indian boy; in the silent menace of Salvaje (correct spelling?)Two things, though, about the DVD. First, if you've seen the movie on TV, the first and last parts are usually shown in widescreen, but the majority of the movie is shown full-screen. Not here! The whole movie is shown in widescreen--making for a sharp, luscious picture. That's the good news (the very good news!). The bad news is . . . there's no scene selection option on the DVD menu! (Why did they leave that out? I do not know.) So,great movie--good (but not great) DVD."
5,Loved every minute of it!!,I love it. It is a truly western classic. Would recommend it to everyone who loves Greg Peck and westerns!!
2,Once is enough,"I don't regret watching this movie but will not watch it again, and definitely will not buy a copy. Simply put, it is very slow and seems much longer than its 110 minutes. It could easily have been edited down to 90 minutes. The first hour is particularly slow. Yet, I must admit the climactic ending was exciting and very tense. Gregory Peck's performance was good. He was his normal solid self. No other actor was interesting. Eva Marie Saint seemed a shadow of the woman we saw in North By Northwest or the Oscar winning On The Waterfront. I am glad I got this from the library and did not pay money to watch it."
1,How can you make a flat fullscreen DVD?,"This is not really a review, since I'm not buying it. I already bought a Spanish DVD more than a year ago of ""The Stalking Moon"", but the ratio was 1.33, not 2.35 as it should, since this is a movie filmed in Panavision. So I'm not paying to have a third of the film. Which seems to be what is being offered now in the US. And it quite a pity, since it is a very good, underrated movie, by a great underrated American filmmaker, Robert Mulligan.Miguel Marías"
1,Bad ratio,"I have been waiting for ""The Stalking Moon"" to come out on DVD for a long, long time -- and now it is here: in 1:33 ratio???!!!! What is going on?! This is not a living-room set, a city location. Why in the world lose most of the film, the grandeur, the beauty of the cinematography? It reminds me of the time I mistakenly bought the ""Standard"" version, ""reformated for your TV,"" version of ""The Music Man,"" and ended up with myriad scenes featuring a barbershop duet, instead of a quartet. No thanks."
3,worth a look,"This film is a little slow, and we don't see the indian until near the end..but this makes it real..they could hide themselves so well. I liked the fight at the end..."
4,A mature Western,"Masterfully staged, expertly directed, superbly paced, suspensefully scored, appropriately laconic, this is an adult's Western for those who can appreciate the mounting tension, rustic atmosphere, and a touch of romance. Connoisseurs will appreciate this Peck/Mulligan/Pakula gem."
2,tug of war,The music is Okee but i didn't receive the special edition shows in the pictures seen under cover.the original cover of the LP in CD format is shown in these pictures.So iám not fully satisfied.Greetings Bart van Lent
3,"Alright, but expected more","The problem with this album is that the production sounds 'dated'. The 80s have this effect on a lot of albums, and this one suffers from synthesized/non organic production. Surprising as well, because it is produced by the great George Martin. The songs are nice and entertaining, but if you compare this to his 70s album, it doesnt really stand the test of time. I prefer McCartney with a live band anytime, but that may be just my opinion. Give it a try if you're willing to hear some McCartney transition."
1,"VERY, VERY BASIC",If you want just the very basic old converted from video tape DVD (copyright is 1987) this is for you. It is definitely not worth the $24.95 asking price. He shows one old style MEC reloading machine The run time is listed as 53 min. 10 min of that is spent walking around out in the desert. What really ticked me off was the advertisements for other videos ran about as long at the one I paid for. Sorry I didn't look for reviews before buying.
1,Great for debunkers,"The book is a total fake. Not even a single photo is real in it. I know this from some really weird guys who believe just everything, but this book they know as fake. And seriously, if you look at the photos... They don't look even near convincing. But they look very similar to soooo many other pictures, just demonstrating that there are simply no alien spacecrafts on earth. But one good thing has the book: You can have a look what is possible with Photoshop, Corel Draw and all the other techniques."
2,What you see is not real,"I looked at every photo in this booklet and it was a total disappointment. This book seems to be aimed at the gullible 'cause almost every photo looks phony. There isn't one qualifying bit of data aside from the author's. The photos look as if the ""UFOs"" were inserted, possibly digitally, and do not look harmonious to the rest of the photo. There is one photo of people at the beach and this giant ""craft"" right in front of them. Not a far-away object but right in your face. Yet, there is not a single individual looking at this marvel. The quality of the photos is pretty poor and you could not for one moment swear that the UFOs are really there. A real poor effort. I could be wrong. But the photos don't cut it with me, who has been a UFO-enthusiast, ex-field investigator, UFO Magazine editor, etc."
1,UGH!,"I was disappointed with this book and would not recommend it to my worst enemy. It drags on foever and the characters, especially the male lead, are unlikeable enough to make you want to slam the book shut and never open it again. This was my first Moore book, and thankfully, my last."
2,"This was almost an interesting book, before the author lost his mind","The best thing I can say about this book is that it is short.Yeah, its going to be that kind of review.The first third or so of this book is typical Moore. It is moderately funny (not as good as most of his other stuff, but not bad mind you), populated with somewhat quirky characters that are pleasant to watch and everything is looking good at this point. Moore's innate writing ability almost distracts you from the rather feeble plot, but that is ok because you just know that at any moment now the plot is going to take off and things are going to get good.And then Moore looses his mind.The rest of the book is just stupid. No, let me clarify that. The rest of the book is astoundingly, painfully unbelievable. It hurts to read this tripe.In short, everything just falls apart. The plot fizzles out, the tension is resolved in an obvious and crude manner, way too many thing just conveniently occur and the result is rather bad."
2,Expected better,I liked Tom Robbins stuff so I tried Coyote Blue which was a decent book and figured I'd try another Christopher Moore book. That was Fluke. I know it is supposed to be absurdest humor but you can't pull it off without enough intrigue. There was intrigue but it built up too slow and it wasn't that humorous. I found it to be little bit of a chore to read because I was just loosing interest.
2,What went wrong?,"I am a huge fan of Christopher Moore. I bought this book went it came out and was saving it for a gray day. I have been looking forward to reading it for month. I finally picked it up last weekend. What a huge disappointment it was!This story drags along, there's no action, it's not very funny...it's the exact opposite of all of Moore's other books: It's boring..Christopher Moore is a really wonderful author, if you have never read a book by him, please! pick any of the others and I guarantee you will enjoy yourself immensely.I am, none the less, looking forward to his next book! I hope Mister Moore will have found his voice back!"
3,Goofy story,"I have to admit that I couldn't put it down (which is worth the three stars), but how anyone could rate this 5 stars is a mystery to me. After a fairly intelligent and interesting beginning, the story turns into a children's sci-fi thriller with silly creatures, an cartoonish villain, a ""god"" made of goo, and lots of references to penises, human and otherwise. I had a pretty good time reading it, but I finished it feeling unsatisfied. It was just a bit too silly."
2,What the--?,"I agree with C. Grove's review. This book started out great. In fact, all through the first half I heartily recommended this book to a whale- and Hawaii-loving friend at work. I loved Moore's humor, his language, and his descriptions of the characters, especially Kona. I enjoyed the science and the mysterious elements. Then, the book took a 180 degree turn and dove past quirky into ""what are you smokin', mon?"", with ""whaley boys"", ""Goo"", and a strange preoccupation with whale ""willies"". By the time I forced myself to finish the book, I was hoping it was all some pot-induced dream Kona was having, and nothing in the second half ever happened. This was my first Moore book, and it's left me in doubt about whether to even try the other one I bought at the same time."
3,Still not sure if I liked it or not,"I am a big fan of Christopher Moore, but this book just did not do it for me. I struggled reading it and it seemed to go at a snail's pace for me. The story was almost too far out there in the last half of the book. I enjoyed the story up to that point and the author really showed his love and worry for whales and dolphins and their existence. Once the story goes ""under the sea"", I was disappointed and just cannot say I enjoyed the book. I am not giving up on Mr. Moore, just hoping that he returns back to his old writing ways."
2,His worst so far,"I really like Chris Moore's stuff, so I eargly awaited this book. I was so disappointed. As a scientist, I have some familiarity with the circumstances he set up in the beginning of the book which had the makings of a good book about the realities of the competition that can occur in research fields (despite his disclaimer at the end)! I'm used to the magical realism Moore likes to through in his books and I enjoy it for the most part. But half-way through he lost the plot, any credibility he had built up and my attention. I struggled through this middle section and, as I really like his writing style, I was able to enjoy the last 1/4 of the book but I was just so bummed by how bad it was compared to his other books! Hopefully Moore will get his stride back soon."
1,Fluke dives,"I had heard good things about Moore and specifically about this book. I started it eagerly. However, as the story unfolded, I found that the book had two fatal flaws: first, I didn't care about Moore's characters; second, his dialogue left me shaking my head in disgust. This is an author who tries too hard to be cute; unfortunately, it doesn't work. Earnestly, I felt as though I were reading a script for a Hollywood film rather than a novel. For true Moore fans, this may be just what you're looking for, but for those who heard all the good things I did and who are ready now to bite: spit the bait out and wait for the inevitable summer movie release in 2005. It may make an entertaining 90-minute movie, but a novel of worth, this one aint."
5,What great read!,"Wow! Christopher Moore is becoming one of my favorite writers and this book is one of his best. He gets just the right mix of humor, science, and fantasy in this tale of whale song researchers. Bravo Chris!"
4,"Good, but could be better","This book was funny, clever and brought up many original ideas that no one has really thought of. This seems charateristic of Moore's books. I enjoyed Fluke but at times it got boring, and if you're not very interested in sea creatues it won't be AS captivating. In general though, it was good."
3,Good Book,"I have to agree with another reviewer listed here: Good, but not great. It was entertaining, very readable, but not that great."
3,"Uhhh, No.","To be disappointed by a Christopher Moore novel is a self-inflicted wound. Anyone who has read one of his works knows the pattern. A plot that offers intriguing hints and a sense of impending upheaval but no clear path to resolution. Characters who are a bit thinly drawn but nonetheless interesting and worth caring about. And then a descent into a fantasy that is fun, but ultimately unsatisfying.""Fluke"" is no exception, and perhaps a step further from the five-star book that Moore may someday write if he can learn to resolve a plot within the world of reality. ""Fluke"" is a fun and easy read, but ultimately has the substance of cotton candy."
4,More fun for vacation in Hawaii,"This is another fun romp from Moore. It takes place in Hawaii and is a fun read while sitting on the beach. It deals with whales. Whales were breaching in the distance as I read this in Puako. Fun stuff. Although whale research is part of the story, there is no real information you can hang your hat on. That's OK by me. I want a fun read and a brain twister. Moore sometimes plays with the brain, too. Anyway, this is low-risk fun -- unless, of course, you are in favor or military bomb testing in whale habitats."
3,"Good, but...","This was a good book, but the person reading it was horrible.It was like he is reading it for the first time & fumbles around with the text."
4,Not a fluke at all...Moore's done it again,"This book is hilarious, strange, and occasionally just icky (but in a fun way). Christopher Moore takes on the weirdness of whales and one of the greatest mysteries of all time (I won't spoil it by telling you which one). Read this book. But if you're easily embarassed, don't read it on the bus/train, etc. And unless you're super coordinated, don't read it on the treadmill, stairclimber, etc. You'll laugh hard enough to fall off...I swear! It's not my favorite Moore, but it's still hilarious!!!"
2,Is it him or me?,"I sought out Christopher Moore's books for years. Practical Demonkeeping, Coyote Blue, the Island book----wonderful, wonderful books, that I recommended and passed around to others. I was very excited to see this book out---but after getting about three-fourths of the way through, I have to say it is unreadable. ""Over the top"" and ""jump the shark"" are inadequate for this book. It's just silly, and not in a fun way. It's almost insulting to the reader. It's very rare that I don't finish a book, and I may make myself finish this, but it will be a struggle. Maybe it's worse because I was so much looking forward to it. I think I will just re-read his first two...."
2,:(,"Christopher Moore's books always grab me and never let go. To my surprise and dismay, Fluke did not. It may have been the guy reading it, but I found myself totally bored with this one. :("
2,What happened????,I was so excited that a new Christopher Moore book was coming out. His other books were page turners and laughs until the end. This book was definitely disappointing. Too much on the whales and not enough of a good story. But I have not given up on Christopher Moore and I will still look forward to reading his books. This one was just not one of his best.
5,GREAT BOOK,"I've been reading through some of the reviews and I am absolutely shocked and appaled that some people gave this a poor review. Yeah, it is a completely outlandish book, but if you are a Christopher Moore reader, what did you expect?I have to say that I enjoyed Lamb a little more, but otherwise this is as good as Moore gets."
3,More clever fun from Moore,"Second Moore title I've read, the first was Practical Demonkeeping. This book is amazingly imagined. Sure, it's over the top, as far as seeming nearly impossible, but that's part of what makes it fun. And Moore doesn't take himself or his characters too seriously. I neither despised nor loved most of the characters, but none of them annoyed me. I could accept them with all their fun quirks. The best is the young well-to-do caucasian Rastafarian.What I love about this book it is that even though it's incredibly silly, it's thoroughly engaging. It did drag a bit in places. Moore's prose could definitely be ""tightened up"" a bit. Regardless, I can't wait to try another Moore title, most likely Lamb."
4,Fun!,"Another crazy Christopher Moore novel set on (and in) the Pacific Ocean. It starts out as a sort of comic environmental mystery as a whale researcher and his team tries to learn the meaning of the whale song. But the novel eventually ends up more like science fiction.As always, Moore is entertaining and witty, and his characters are colorful and memorable. It was not my favorite Moore novel, but it is certainly worthwhile for his fans, and recommended reading for anyone who is looking for something fun and light and with a message."
4,CHRISTOPHER MOORE DOES IT AGAIN,"Christopher Moore is almost always hilarious and with FLUKE he is right on again. Nathan Quinn is a marine biologist that gets swallowed by a whale. Then the fun begins. If you like laugh out loud situations, characters, and dialogue, this is a book for you. Understand I am a fan of Mr. Moore, most of his books are worth purchasing but FLUKE is better than most. RECOMMENDED."
2,Not one of his best efforts,Fluke is not what you call your typical christopher Moore book. It misses a lot of those little twists you expect from him. Lot of technical background goes in it to fully understand and the plot is not really a plot. Go for other titles - like Coyote Blue you will have more fun out of your money.
3,Started out great....then took a wrong turn,"This was my first of Moore's books. I just happened to pick it up at my local bookstore and read the back of the book and laughed outloud at the premise. I read the first couple of chapters at the store and had to buy it to see what would occur with these wonderful characters. The characters are well thought out, very personable and with such interesting dialogue you feel like you are a fly on the wall in the book. I sped through the first half of the book laughing and enjoying myself immensely, and then BOOM...it became a sci-fi book before my eyes. The dialogue was not nearly as quick and the story became positively dull at times, so much so that I shamefully admit to skimming the last 100 pages of the book just to finish it up and praying for a return to what I had enjoyed. This book hasn't made me not want to read other Moore books, but next time around I will probably check them out from my local library to save a couple of bucks."
2,What happened?!,This was my first Christopher Moore book and I must say the first half of the book was great and I was really enjoying the story then....well everything changed so far beyond reality it was just too much! I may or may not try another of his books. I will need some time to regroup after this one.
3,Where are the whales???,"This was my second Moore experience and I really like his whimsy, but about halfway through the book the plot steered off course. The main character was literally lost at sea without a sextant. Gooville? Gimme a break! I really thought the story was going to be about talking whales! While Moore obviously cares about the survival of these beautiful creatures, he didn't let them tell their own story as I'd hoped."
2,I don't get it,"I had not read any of Christpoher Moore's other books but based on reviews picked up ""Fluke"". I was very disappointed. The first third of the book was somewhat interesting (hence two stars instead of one), if not funny, but the second two thirds degenerated into implausible and nearly unreadable silliness that would only be worth reading if it were in someway humorous. Clearly, my sense of humor differs from most of the reviewers here, but I suppose either you get Moore's rather unique sense of humor or you don't."
2,Weird and disappointing,"To reiterate the other reviews would be redundant. I listened to Bill Irwin in the audio book and thought he did an excellent job despite what seemed to be a Canadian accent throughout (is he Canadian? I don't know.) The minute we met the whaley boys I was angry at the author for driving these interesting and compelling characters into a Stephen King world. Whaley Boys? The Goo? Amelia Earhardt getting down with the Goo? Really, this was just stupid. And I just couldn't stop thinking about all the beached whales that are never mentioned - what happened there, drunk driving? I would not recommend this book to anybody who values their precious time with books. I give it 2 stars because the first half was excellent and deserves recognition."
1,"Newcomers, don't lose faith, but ""What the....?""","I have been a huge fan of Christopher Moore since Practical Demonkeeping, and have read almost everything he's ever written. I don't know what happened with this book, but it was definitely not demonstrative of his other work. The books starts out interestingly and intriguingly, but takes a nose dive into ""absurd, even beyond the point of entertaining"".Christopher? Do you have a boat you're trying to pay for?For those of you who have not read any of Moore's other books, I STRONGLY encourage you to try some of his other works like Practical Demonkeeping, Island of the Sequined Love Nun, or Coyote Blue (Classic Trickster tale...very cool!)If you're not afraid of pushing the envelope of convention in thinking, I HIGHLY recommend Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal. This is not only Moore's BEST work, but one of my favorite books ever!!! And I don't have many favorite books!"
2,Funny but subpar work from Moore!,"Christopher Moore is without a doubt my favorite author. After reading Bloodsucking Fiends I have done everything in my power to read all his other novels. I have now almost read them all and loved them until Fluke. While the typical Moore humor is in place this story is maybe too weird for me to get into. The quirky characters that are always present in his work are still in here but not as memorable as other books. Overall, the story is funny but not enough for me to enjoy, sadly."
4,Adult version of Smurfs meet Ice Age,"If it weren't for Moore's loads of sarcasm (which I love) this would have been a totally cheesy chalupa. I mean this really is a storyline I would have liked much more in 2nd grade than today. Although I don't recal the whale's farting, we did talk about whale sphincter's about as much as any 8 year old boy.The animals control the world under which appears to be run from a remote location by PAPA smurf. But a crazy, adult, sophmoric version of him. In the end, the main character, not Papa smurf saves the day, and I guess everyone, meaning Batman and his ""stoned"" version of Robin, lives happily ever after.Like I said, I did enjoy the sarcasm, so I'll definitely try one more of his books -- LAMB, probably. The book I initially wanted to read, but stumbled on FLUKE and thought why not."
4,Audio version,"I enjoyed this audio version of Fluke.... At first I found the cadence of Bill Irwin a little odd in that he sometimes inserts pauses at unexpected places. It didn't take long to appreciate the effect, however. He does well with making the characters discernable; although, his Rasta guy sounds just like his Irish gal and his Greek guy. It's not an iritation though. His performance enhanced the story.By the way, this is my first book by Christopher Moore & I'm hooked. I loved and related to all the characters - esp. Kona the faux Hawaiian. The strange twists in this story are the kind of thing where you love 'em or hate 'em, I guess. I won't ruin it for you other readers/listeners by going too much into the story. My favorite line was ...it felt like he had to pee really badly from his eyes....I'd recommend this audio book to anyone who enjoys a good, intelligent laugh generated by deep set of great characters."
5,"Wow, yet again.","Laughing out loud is my favorite sport, and among the handful of things I can count on to make that happen in a deep, meaningful, rib-aching, do-NOT-drink-milk-right-now sort of a way, is the writing of Christopher Moore. His great humor is leavened with astute thoughtfulness that occasionally borders on sweet, and is always engaging.He's really done a quality job again with FLUKE. It's a story eased into at different pacing than his other works, making for a more pronounced sense of payoff. If you appreciate and respond well to tight dialogue, you'll admire FLUKE; it's Moore's very best work in this aspect. The genuine human rhythm of it is the flawless bluescreen behind the well-wrought, snappy laughs. It's a spectacularly outrageous story, and just as suitable as dessert for always-hungry readers as a perfect work to hook the more reticent.I recommend you buy this book. :)"
2,Way too weird to be funny or entertaining.,"This was my first Christopher Moore book, and may be my last. This book started off good enough, I liked the people, their situation, and the interactions between each one. It started off as a good, somewhat humorous tale about whaling research. Funny, amusing - pretty much what I hoped for.Then all of sudden, the plot went out there. The second half of the book was a giant, ""what the heck is this?"". From whaling research in Hawaii, it switches to a story about whale boy hybrids, giant Goos controlling the seas, and Amelia Earhart. It just was too out there to be interesting or funny."
5,amazing and inspiring book!,"Reiki is love, and this book is really made in a reiki way. Inspiring, as the Reiki Master Teacher Gaetano Vivo; a real guide for life."
5,Hooray for HepCat!,"Hooray for HepCat for creating brand new editions of Ronnie Earl's early discography with the Broadcasters! I am very satisfied with the quality of the disc and the beautiful packaging, including current reviews added to the original liner notes. This purchase has exceeded my expectations."
4,Does the job,I use this as a backup lock for my bike. I ride my bike to work daily and have a U lock at my usual parking spot outside of work (leave it there nightly). I carry this lock on my bike if I am out doing errands and don't want to lug the U lock around. Probably not the best lock for long term safety but works great my purpose. Easy to open and close and turning for combination.
3,looks heftier than the photo,"I purchased this bike lock for my mom for Christmas. It would be a fine lock for someone who is either not all that worried about their bike being stolen or those who live in such a safe neighborhood that you could probably leave your bike outside overnight without worry of it beig stolen. The cable is thinner that it appears in the photo. The lock tumbler is tiny as well. If you really want to protect your bike from being stolen, you better go with a heftier lock."
3,Secure as butter!,"I didn't buy this lock for it's security features, but as a deterrent it worked fine for me. It would not hold up to a determined 10 year old though. If you want a lock, buy a lock, but if you only need something to make a thief go for easier pickings, then save your cash and buy this."
3,Good for the price,"This is a good, lightweight lock, except that the lock does not seem that strong. In other words, I do not leave my bike out over night with this lock."
3,just okay,"I bought this cable lock for my bike. And it works most of the time, but I found that sometimes it isn't long enough to wrap around trees. Also, the combo lock doesn't rotate 360 degrees, so it makes it difficult to connect the two pieces."
3,Cheap and Built that Way too,"What can you expect from such a cheap item? It does the job if you are running into a building for a relatively short period of time, but I would not trust this for much longer. It is fairly flimsily built, but for this price point it suits most peoples budget while providing minimal security. What is a bike lock for anyways, peace of mind not true protection."
4,Comical relief,"This is the 3 DVD of Zatch Bell and I think it turned out quite well.As usual Makoto Raiko made a cartoon which has meaning and humour all in one. Ok so maybe the episode The Invincible Folgore didn't have that much meaning but me and my friends sat there laughing our heads off. I guess Makoto wanted Zatch Bell to have a bit of comical relief. The last episode is great but quite sad so you have to feel quite sorry for the character (Sherry). I won't try to descibe to much of the story though, you will have to find that out for yourself. Personally its a great buy if you aren't to serious to watch a Silly Italian superstar and his mamodo dancing around and making great fools of themselfs. (Don't worry serious people the rest of the episodes are a great watch for you to!). I recomend this to all people over the age of 10. Zatch Bell is my favorite show so why shouldn't i give it a 4 out of 5."
3,Zatch Bell is the best...but not this disc...,"Be warned: This disc contains the only bad Zatch Bell Episode ""The Invincible Folgore"", and the story might be a two-part episode.In this episode, there is a very annoying singer, and his mamoda is the most ridicoulous looking thing on earth. It's head looks like the top of a pumpkin, and it has a duck mouth. I don't think I need to say anymore than that.The other two episodes are worth it, but the first two volumes were way better. The cheap price also makes it worthit. Just be cautious, and if you are thinking of getting into Zatch Bell and are one of those people who don't care about getting the DVD's and watching them in order, don't buy this one first. Vol. 1 and 2 are highly recommended, but unless your a true Zatch Bell Fan who will die if they don't have this DVD, this DVD shouldn't be on your want list."
4,"It's not CRAP, it works well for the price","I have used it once. It takes photos only if these photos are going to be used for the internet or computer use only. YOU CANNOT PRINT THEM, like you would with a regular camera BECAUSE IT IS NOT. It is what it is, a web camera oh and the video camera you will like. As far as the photos, you can use the company's software on the disk or you can install the photos using the MS Windows photo wizard. Either one would do."
4,A good GPS to have,I bought mine just before the christmas and even paid charges for the 2 day shipping as i wanted to have it before christmas. Anyways i tested the unit by taking it to a place i had never been to before and i must say it performed admirably.The only drawback that i have seen till date is the text to speech feature doesn't always speak the names of the street or the Hwys. I did play around a bit with the settings when i received it so am not sure if it is a setting that i messed up or the unit itself has an issue.But initially it did speak a few street names but not all of them that it wanted to take me on.
4,Gets it right--most of the time,"So far,I am pleased with this product. There have been a couple of incidents when I am not sure it selected the best route. It chose the Interstate rather that a straight shot two lane. I am not sure which was the best route time wise . Any time you do not ""obey"" the suggested turns, the Jill voice says ""recalculating"" in a slightly exasperated tone, which I find amusing. Occasionally it will do an odd pronunciation also. It did not find a restaurant once, probably because it needs a new map update. All in all, it is easy to use and seems to be a good choice."
4,EASY NAVIGATION,"I bought this couple of weeks back, it arrived bit late but amazon kindly refunded the shipping charges and sent out as soon as they had it in stock. c340 is easy to use and i would recommend for the beginners who are new to GPS."
5,Never be lost again,"I really love the Garmin StreetPilot c340. It provides all the features of most other similar products and I was able to get it at a decent price on sale. I like the way it announces the street names just before the turns and if you miss the turn it will recalculate to let you know how to get back on track.Unfortunately, the suction cup mount is not supposed to be used in my state. This is a minor setback but I don't like using adhesive on my dash for the optional mount and I'm too cheap to buy the mount that's supposed to work without adhesive. In addition, this does not work very well if you're not on a street. I understand it's not really designed for anything else but it would be nice to mark where you parked your car and it give you directions on how to get there. The main reason I purchased this, however, was for our road trips and for this it works perfectly."
5,Great Garmin!,Just what we wanted. Easy to use and even had a back way that no other navigation system had.
4,Portable GPS,"This product is amazing. If you use it during the daytime, the map is daytime. If you use it at nighttime, it changes to night map. Very easy interface to use. My only concern is that it can get hot after one hour of use."
4,great little device,Have used the GPS several times and it has gotten me where I want to go without fail. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a decent GPS for not a lot of money
4,My Garmin GPS,"I purchased the Garmin C340 to assist me in my job. The device is very easy to use. Take it out of the box, secure it to the windshield, and plug it into your outlet. It is simple to remove so that you can put it in your trunk or take it with you when you are not in your vehicle.Sometimes the GPS directions are inaccurate. If you ignore the speaker's directions, the system recalculates the directions. My husband loves the device. I prefer to use a map and my intuition.Garmin StreetPilot c340 Traffic-Ready Vehicle GPS Navigator"
5,I m lovin' it!!!,"I bought this C-340 about 1 month back.It is one of the most wise purchases i made!AMAZON service is GREAT! It was delivered 1 week before time.""Jill"" text to speech ....Girl she is good!Pros:Very accurateMakes life simpleGood battery lifeTouch screen is very simple to useI have mounted in my BMW dash .....so far it is holding up good!like the options of restaurant and fuel stations.Cons:Glare in daytimestreet maps not updated.But you know what ,.....for this price....c'mon....can't complain.i would give 4.5 stars.If you are debating between...330 v/s 340.....GO WITH C-340.TEXT TO SPEECH OPTION IS WORTH EVERY PENNY PLUS ONE PENNY!Some reviews say, street names are pronounced funny....I would say...may be one in hundred.....Well,as human we make mistakes in pronounciation too!!! Isn't it!Y.Dialani"
4,Great in most situations,"If you're traveling to an area that is not experiencing a lot of road construction or new housing developments, you'll be fine. It will take you right to the doorstep in style. Good clear directions on a large, bright screen make it easy to see. The suction mount is just a notch short of super glue. It won't let go. I live in an area with many new subdivisions springing up. Much of the city's residential areas and accompanying road construction are not yet in the system. I'm new to the area, so it will be great when these areas are added to software. Some of them are 4 - 5 years old and are still not yet in the unit. Other than that, this is a straight forward, easy to operate, effective unit that does what it says it will do."
4,Garmin C340 review,"The product is quite satisfactory. It is ""User Friendly"" which makes its navigation quite understandable. There are occasional errors probably produced by interpreting its internal navigational maps.I wish they would offer map updates. This product was bought about a month ago could use one."
2,ok for cheap,"This is ok if you are looking for a cheap gps. First off it is outdated, but for the price I expected for it not to be current. It drops satellites way worse than my previous two gps's, which is disturbing. I have a great sense of direction, so no problem, but my wife has a really hard time with directions, so is terrifying for her. The real problem with it, is the holder, it doesn't stick at all. I had another Garmin and had the portable sand bag that worked great. It doesn't work with this one because the mount is an inverse of the way most of these work. My mount has the ball as does my motorcycle, but the unit has the ball so it is backwards. We lay it in my truck's console, but no place to set it in my accord."
4,Good product,"Good for someone that is not an electronic minded person, I used it alot for trips and never got lost."
3,c340,"it is a product with excellent potential, versatile, easy to setup and not too hard to use, potentially good value and will serve its user well as soon as garmin puts some decent US-wide maps in it,the c340 worked ~92% for the Miami, FL region, i only missed one meeting, which actually happened to be an important one, in ohter cases it guided me welli sent the product back to the manufacturer based on 60-% performance for mid-NJ, which made the product totally useless for where i actually live and spend most of my driving time"
4,NOT TRAFFIC READY,"To be fair. I loved this device. I say ""loved this device"" because I have returned it back to amazon (which was very easy and at no cost.) One of the reasons I chose this model C 340 is because it as ""Traffic Ready"". What this means I am not sure any more. One thing I do know Is that It is not traffic ready UNLESS you purchase SEPERATLY the TRAFFIC RECIEVING ANTENNA. This costs at least $150.00 or more extra. I repeat the traffic feature DOES NOT work without this additional antenna and subscription. I have basically dediced to spend a few more well actually $100.00 more and get the Garmin c550. Not only Is it ""Traffic ready"" but It comes with a built in traffic antenna, the antenna is in the power cord that plugs into the cigerette lighter. This makes the c 550 truely TRAFFIC READY!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Not only do I NOT have to buy an additional antenna but it comes with many other bells and whistles. If knowing the flow of the traffic is not important to you the C340 was near perfect."
5,Great GPS System,"The Garmin StreetPilot c340 is a great product. I bought it for my husband because he travels often with business through-out PA, MA, NJ, and VA. He absolutely loves it. There has been a few roads or buildings we could not find due to being new but otherwise the system has worked wonderfully. The screen is easy to read and placement to windshield is simple. We recommend it highly. We used it right out of the box and it was easy to program addresses. The default voice is a bit annoying but it can be changed. We like Karen who has an Australian accent. Amazon had the best price and shipped the product quickly and efficiently."
4,User Friendly,"After purchasing & using the Garmin Streetpilot C340 Portable GPS Navigation System, I would describe it as very, very ""User Friendly"". I took it from the shipping carton, plugged it into the cigarette lighter, and within a few minutes, I was programming different (my favorite) addresses into it. I researched the cost at many different sites, and found the best buy at Amazon.com -I would recommend this GPS system to both the novice beginner or the experienced user of GPS systems."
2,Poor product,Major issues include very delayed response and reception. Connection with satellite takes for ever and seems lost many a times. Connection drops out at the drop of a hat. A bit of cloud cover and there goes the connection. A few trees overhead and it loses it. What's with the 4 and 5 stars? Ridiculous!
4,Fantastic,"I received this as a gift. I live in one of the outlying cities of NYC. I moved here about 2 years ago. I am not afraid to drive here, and to my own merit, I do have pretty good mapping skills.Then why do I love having this GPS in my car? I can get around traffic ( which is an everyday occasion here), I can also go from point A to point B without needing to consider one-way streets, etc.It is accurate and easy to use."
4,Very Helpful Item,"I have found the Garmin c340 very reliable after testing it out for the past couple of weeks. It's not perfect and you may have to play with it sometimes to get it to do exactly what you want, but it is very easy to operate and works well. The voice prompts are clear and timely. Overall, I'm impressed with the Garmin. The one thing I didn't find that reliable was it's estimation of miles to a destination. The estimates are generally off (sometimes by quite a bit)and I haven't figured out yet if it's me or the machine. I would recommend this item."
4,It works very well,"We've only had this for a few weeks but it works predictably and well. We were receiving a weak but usable satelite signal even inside our house. My 10 year old daughter had it operational and pretty much figured out how to program it on the way home from the store. The convenience it provides makes it worth the investment. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is for it's size. It has a battery but it's just large to the point that it is a little cumbersome to use it outside the car. The Nuvi was considered and given the oportunity I would have spent the extra $$ for the 350 or 360. If you're considering a gps, this one is great."
2,"no computer software, can not up load trips to it","I found out the hard way that you can not up load maps or destinations from your home computer to this unit.I bought Gamin 340 model, and then I bought way point trips (garmin) software program and no luck after communicating with Garmin this unit still it does not have the capability.The unit works as well as can be expected with some signal loss in city locations.But sometimes I need to customize my trip route, to avoid downtown New York City traffic and this unit thinks the fastest way to the Queens is straight thru New York city, I guess it has never driven in new york before..lol"
4,Garmin C340,Garmin StreetPilot c340 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorWhen you find yourself in unknown locations this little wonder will locate your destination. It will save you time and fuel.
2,This unit is manufacturer discontinued,"The unit is great, but is a discontinued model, and nowhere that I could find in all the advertising does Garmin publish this, or do the retailers. The only way I found out was to go to the Garmin website and try to update the maps. You also must have purchased the unit because you have to put in the serial # b-4 you can get to the portion of the website that tells you-Manufacture Discontinued!!! Shame on you Garmin!!!"
4,Garmin 340,The Garmin 340 works great and I've had no problems with it. The only complaint is that the voice on the GPS will not say the name of the street correctly but this is a minor problem.
2,"Good Features. However, performance is lacking","This has all the features you would want. Such as text-to-speech, easy to use user interface, POIs, it searches addresses as you enter the characters..reducing the need to have to fully spell out the street. However, the GPS receiver is not a Srf III. I traveled to Boston, the oldest city and it could not find one of the oldest streets in history [Beacon or Beacon Hill]. In the city, it kept loosing the signal and it was somewhat useless as it could not direct you to a location without endless re-calculation due to signal losses. I'm glad I did purchase it in time for my trip. Now, I know how important it is to have a GPS with a more responsive receiver, such as SRF III. Again, feature wise it is awesome. But, if it can't guide you or provide you with somewhat accurate directions, it isn't much good. Even in Georgia, it kept dropping signals. I purchased a GPS for my phone and it hasn't dropped a signal and it is so much precise and accurate."
5,I love it!,"for a direction -challenged, newcomer to Atlanta, Ga - The Garmin c340 gets me where I need to be."
4,"Wonderful Product, Very few flaws!","I bought this device for my wife so she could get herself around the city for work. She loves the easy to use interface, and most importantly the verbal commands that it gives. We purchased this model over the c330 for the spoken street names, which work great. The only thing that is even remotely difficult is the POI Loader software that Garmin recommends for entering in your own points of interest. Also, I recommend that you get the map updates almost as soon as you get the device out of the box. I live in an area that has developed immensely since the release of the c340, so several of the POIs were not preloaded. Despite these two small things, this device is absolutely wonderful. It takes a lot of stress out of driving in a busy city, and recalculates lightning quick if you miss a turn. I would recommend this product to anyone who is just looking for a navigational system without all the added bells and whistles (mp3 and bluetooth stuff)."
5,Impressive Gadget!,"Very easy to use. Loved the touch screen. Tested the device by going another way other than the listed route and the system quickly recalculated (2 seconds) and plotted exactly! 100% portable to other vehicles since the satellite is built into the device...no extra attachments and no multiple accessories needed. Hard to see sometimes in daylight, but otherwise and good GPS system!"
2,Garmin C340 Screen Locks Up,"The Garmin C340 StreetPilot screen locks up frequently during use and you must restart the unit; it is often useless until you unplug from power and restart the unit. Jim Porter,PTC GAGarmin StreetPilot c340 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator"
2,just okay,"Its works just okay/ I took it to Hawaii on a trip and it lost signal about 75% of the time. And worse than that when it was working it took us to the wrong place. I took it again on a trip to Flordia and it couldn't even find Disney world Or it would take me about two blocks from where I was supposed to be and lose signal. At home in Arizona after the trip the clock never worked corectly again. It does do better here in az, but again sometimes it will take you to the wrong place. If I had to do it again I would buy a better quality one and spend more money."
4,over all a 4 and 1/2,"I'm happy with the Garmin C340. The only thing I find it is sometimes hard to read in the sun. ( That could be because of the locate on the window.) Was in Utah, needed to find a store, looked it up on the Garmin, it came up, and was able to drive to the Store. Great investment. Yes I would buy another one.The biggest problem I had was I ordered it on line, and didn't see that last time I ordered something I had it sent to another address. UPS was not helpfull at all. I think I will ask to have thing sent by Fed XRay L.Fernley, Nv"
4,GPS,I took it out of the box and it worked! The size is perfect. The only thing that I would ike is if it had the option to change it while driving or not.
1,Don't buy it,"This GPS does not seem to work in large cities. My husband was driving in L.A. and it kept losing its signal and repeating the word ""recalculating."" He got lost several times as a result. He would have been better off with a paper map."
3,Helpful but sure needs refinement.,"Very intuitive to use. I was very disappointed using it in Kansas City-poor routing from the airport and maps for downtown K.C. were horribly out of date. It got me to where I needed in Denver, but routing again was very mediocre. This GPS will get you to where you need to go, but don't depend on it for efficient routing."
1,Has a mind of its own after a year,"Garmin StreetPilot c340 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorI bought this for $350 in Jan 2007 and was delighted with it at first, It's very user-friendly and intuitive. But then the battery died and I discovered that the car charger is defective and doesn't work. So, I have to charge it using my PC. Okay, I've adapted. Then, I swear moments after the one year warranty ran out, the gps went wacko. I would hit the button for a common destination and get the screen for all the gas stations in the area. I tried over and over and couldn't navigate the navigation system. Some crazy robot brain had taken over. Oh, I'm sure that I can spend some major bucks to download an upgrade for it. Why can't it work right in the first place?"
4,garmin streetpilot,"Product fun and easy to use and recommended. Price is right and has everything one could need, especially as a first time user. Best feature--can always get you back on track if lost. What more can you want.Maps (v8) not always 100% accurate though, but this seems inherent in even on-line maps. Good idea to review your route before.The instructions that come with the unit are not comprehensive enough to discuss all features of the product, but over a little time, you find little features that are a happy surprise.This is our first GPS. Although a good tool, I am now starting to question its use by new drivers. It can be more distracting than helpful. Even for experienced drivers there seems to be a competition between the GPs and the radio, especially if the upcoming route consists of quick changes.. Again, this is related more the the GPS than this particulate product."
3,Pros and Cons... Short and Sweet!,"Pros -User friendly reasonably accurate some nice features.Cons -1. Takes too long to track satellite.2. Window mount - falls off the window. Cumbersome and expensive to replace.Own a Tom Tom as well. Compared the two in an A-B simultaneous comparison...They both will get you there. The directions were the same. The terminology of where to go was different, but equal.The Tom Tom does not fall off the window, and fits in your pocket. Grabs the satellite much faster than the Garmin. If I had to buy again, probably the Tom Tom - just because of the Satellite reception time."
4,Garmin c340 is old but great!,the battery is lasting ages. the receiver is great but the product itself if huge and heavy!
4,Garmin C340 GPS,"The Garmin C340 is very easy to use. Was used on a recent trip in California. At times, did not always list the shortest distance but was about 90% reliable to help get to final destination. Voice is a little low and radio has to be low in order to hear directions and people can not be talking to loud. Hard to see screen in daylight. One bad feature is that the unit has to be attached to the holder it comes with in order to charge the unit. In California you can not mount to the front window so harder to manage the unit. Other than that, so far I am happy with the purchase and for the price it is a great deal."
4,Great GPS,"No learning curve, figured it out right out of the box. Got me from Newport, RI to San DIego, Ca easily. The only problem I had was with the mount staying in position. It worked fine stuck to the windshield, once I got to CA and had to (illegal to drive with anything suction mounted to windshield) switch to the dash mount, any bump in the road would cause the unit to tilt down so that it was no longer easily readible. Fixed that with a bit of superglue, now it's fine."
5,Get there on time!,"Excellent help in doing my job as a Realtor. I may schedule 5 - 7 showings in a day, and can get from one to the next with ease!"
5,garmin street pilot c340,"Great GPS unit. Very easy to set up and use. Good graphics so you can easily drive and look at the screen. The audio doesn't pronounce some of the locations very well, but that's a minor detail. I like that it tells you ahead of time for making turns so you can change lanes if you need to. I've tried to outsmart it for the fun of it and it always gets me to where I need to be with no problems."
4,Excellent GPS real good.,Pretty nice and compact GPS and worked really well under all conditions and calculated pretty fast. Real good buy and worth every penny.Gave a 4 instead of 5 for the only reason that suction type stand was difficult to take off the mirror and had to pull real hard.But gave perfect directions.
4,great,"on the road alot. easy to use ,couldnt get along without it. wish it would show different routes."
5,Great GPS for anyone,"Love this GPS system. It's easy to use, easy to read and I cannot say enough good about it. I actually have nothing bad to say. I was in a really bad traffic jam on 81 in NY and hit the detour button - awesome. I must have saved at least an hour of time going through the detour. I highly recommend this GPS system. It's inexpensive and easy to use and best of all portable so we can use it from car to car. Buy it - you won't regret it."
4,Good Unit But Map Database is Out of Date,"I bought this unit just before a trip from Phoenix to San Diego and it performed very well. The only drawback with it is that the map database is probably several years out of date, at least for the area where I live, in a fast growing area east of Phoenix proper. The unit knows nothing of a new surface arterial near my house that has been open for at least 3 1/2 years, since I moved here, and a new freeway that has now been open for one year. The result is that if I want the unit to guide me from home to my destination using those routes, it will be busy announcing constant recalculations of route until it gets back into the known world. I suspect this will be an issue with all Garming GPS units as they share the same map database. Other than that localized glitch, I'd highly recommend this unit."
5,Great Product; easy to use & accurate.,We got this for traveling and it is very easy to use. We took it on a trip right after getting it and it was amazing. Simple to use and very accurate. We like the voice directions in addition to the map. It doesn't come with a in-depth owners manual and after using it we knew why; it is very self explanatory. We highly recommend it.
4,"So far, so good.","I travel on business constantly, so this was a necessity. I have used it for two weeks now and I find it for the most part very accurate, although it doesn't necessarily map out the shortest route. There have been a couple of times where I sort of knew the general direction of where I wanted to go and ignored the recommended route and did a short cut and it recalculated and gave me a much short ETA because of that. Aside from that though, it seems right on with its accuracy and the feature which tells you the actual street names is excellent. I would recommend this product."
2,The internet review warnings are real!,"I was hesitant to buy the new c340 (next up from c330). The street names it announces is a major plus, but....... it didn't work out of the box, took six hours to find a satellite signal -- in Los Angeles. Definitely a buggy unit. Then when it did work, it would tell me to turn right or left at a street, just as or after I passed it! It also wouldn't let me drive the route I want to drive. If I'm on side streets, it tries to get me on the freeway -- when I went on the freeway, it wanted me to exit at every exit! There is an option for Fastest or Shortest route, so that wasn't the problem. Same thing with Detour. I'm sure it's just a buggy one, there seems to be a lot of them out there -- otherwise Garmin would be out of business and there would be a lot of unhappy drivers."
1,Junk after 10 minutes!,"I bought this product. It worked great right out of the box...for about 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the screen went dark and fuzzy and nothing I could do would bring it back. I called Garmin's tech support. They walked me through a quick reset to no avail. Then the technician said ""maybe the battery will charge better through the USB adapter"". Didn't sound right, but I tried it. Didn't help. I am currently in the process of returning this paperweight to Amazon."
5,A must for seniors,"As traffic, speeds and turn offs come at you faster, the GArmin tells you in advance where you need to turn and what lane you need to be in. A real safety item."
2,Beware of mapping updates,"I just tried to put the 2009 City Navigator North America NT map into this GPSr. It will not show water features after the update. Garmin has told me that this is a problem with this unit. They are reimbursing me the price of the map update because I can't use it for finding streams, lakes, and rivers. If all you want to do is put in an address and go, that's fine. It's been a great GPSr for me and has taken me places I didn't even know exist. Just remember that you may not be able to see the water features on the map, depending on your location. And you may not be able to pinpoint your favorite fishing hole because it won't show up - all all. I'm putting the old 2008 map back in so I can use it for finding water features.For the price of this unit, you can get a new one and not go through the headache of using outdated maps for the rest of the time you use it."
5,Bertha,We used our Garmin Street Pilot c340 (a.k.a. Bertha) within 3 days after receiving it to go to Syracuse to a gun/knife show. She performed wonderfully. We even had some roads and streets that were under construciton or shut down and when we turned because of them Bertha got us right back on track.We recently went to KY for a family visit and Bertha was great. I don't think we can get lost or stranded in a place we can't get out of with this navigator.We could not be more pleased.
3,"Good product, lousy accessories","The Garmin StreetPilot is easy enough to navigate and use, especially for people like me who are slightly technologically impaired. However, my biggest disappointment was when it ran out of battery on me and I went to plug in the car adapter/charger that came with it--much to my shagrin, the adapter did not fit the streetpilot! I had to go and buy a separate car charger. I'd highly recommend the product but be forewarned that you may need to buy accessories separately."
4,good product for the price,"Good product for the price, but I wish I would have spent a little more and bought a nuvi instead. It would have been smaller to carry along in my bag would we travel."
4,my StreetPilot c330,i have homeimprovement business and i travel between westerly RI to Boston Mass for estimate and my garmin is doing job very well.I pay in 2007 more than 200$ but worth thousand.Only two thinks i can say 1-cranston rhodeisland some restaurant all ready open 4 years ago garmin dosent show 2-mansfield Mass home depot Garmin dosent show my costumer they say that home depot allready there few years.Anyway i still happy i wont go to work with out my streetpilot.
4,Perfect for going places,This product is perfect for going places you haven't gone to before. The map literally knows every street in the US and Canada. My only concern is that when it tells you to turn its not fast enough. When your driving in a place you haven't been to before this may be either dangerous or annoying because you keep missing the road. Therefore you should drive with a passenger when using this product so that he/she can follow the built in map while your driving. Other than that this product is awesome and i have no complaints.
5,Great product!,This is a wonderful item! Not only does it give you turn by turn directions. It also gives the street names for easy navigation. I recommend it highly!
5,wonderful,We just love this GPS. Never uses one before either. The whole family uses it. It is amazing. I did my research and made a great choice. We have owned this one for 6 months now. We even packed it to take to Colorado with us. It never let us down. I highly recomend.
5,Garman C340 GPS,"Love it - ready to use right out of the box. I have no sense of direction so the clear audio gives enough advance warnings for any upcoming changes. The screen is easy to read and I have not had any problems with glare. The only problem I have is that I cannot register the unit with Garmin. Even though my unit was listed as new (and it was sealed), their records show this unit has already been registered. This will be a problem if I want to download any updates."
4,Review of C340,I like the C340. I am amazed at how well if performs. My only problem is that I can not figure out how to enter an intersectioin in the go to option.Sam Strong for Helga
4,How did we live without this product,Very easy to use. Really enjoy the security of knowing we will never be lost again. Have come across a few addresses that our Garmin could not locate but for the most part we love it.
5,Handy little machine,"Just got back from using on vacation. Generally worked real good - kept loosing signal in the mountains and in the big city, but still had good directions. My son has the unit that does not give the street names (a bit cheaper) but I really found the name to be very helpful since you sometimes have several streets all together. I probably will not use daily, but when traveling in unfamiliar territory it's real handy. You have to try to find a mounting location that get's the unit out of the bright sun and reflections to help see the screen, but you really do not want to be doing to much looking at it while driving any way - it talks to you enough."
4,Good GPS,"After a TON of research about which GPS system is right for us, I went with the Garmin c340. And you know what? It is the right one for us! It has all of the features I find important (reroute around traffic, saying street names, etc) and was a reasonable price. Granted, there are no crazy bells and whistles on this model, but it does the job well! We are very pleased."
5,Great GPS - truly plug and go!,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He always loves having new gadgets. Plain and simple. Great for what you need it for. It is truly plug and go. We took it on a road trip and by the time my husband went in a store to buy us coffee and get back to the car, I had it hooked up and ready to go. Has given us great directions so far. Voice is clear, picture and options are great. Definitely recommend!"
5,A++ PRODUCT,This GPS was so much more than I ever expected. I bought it for my husband who is a long-haul trucker. He says he doesn't know how he ever got anywhere without it. It does everything he needs and so much more. We were so pleased we ordered one for each of our sons. GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY!!
4,All that I wanted,I bought this product because my cousin said it was wonderful. She was right. It does everything I needed it to do. My only complaint is that in bright light it is hard to read the screen.
4,Too Big for Small Car,"The C340 is excellent for navigation, but the size does not fit well in a small car's window. I have a German made convertible and I could never get the suction window mount into the window and use a dash pillow instead. There are other flat panel styles that may work better. I am amazed at how well it works, but it also has on occassion gotten confused by the location and given me a strange route to my destination. For the most part it works well and the text to voice is well worth the extra cost."
5,How Can You Live Without One?,"This in-car GPS has all the latest maps and talks you through your route. Even if it makes a mistake, it will correct itself. You might find the word pronunciation a little strange at times. I also have a C-330 in another car and I really couldn't do without them now."
4,GREAT TOOL!,Over a million points of interest.. has awesome reception even when I went throgh tunnels.. taken few roadtrips with it. Sometimes I travel a route I want to go and then let the Garmin recalculate route.. Only wish it would tell you to turn a little sooner.. sometimes to close to turn to switch lanes (but that seems to problem with them all).
2,what happened to intersections?,what happened to inputting intersections? Unlike the c330 (which has this) this feature has been omitted (why? this is a standard feature in gps units) in the event that you have an address that is just not in your maps at least a person can give you the cross streets. Text to speach is cute but not at the expense of leaving out the intersection feature!
3,Liked the c330 better,"Replaced my stolen C330 with the C340. The C340 seems to take longer to acquire my position on start up. Most other features are the same. I wish I had replaced the C330 with another C330, the extra feature is not worth the extra money. I feel the C330 is a better unit."
2,Horrible Sattelite Service in San Francisco,I am sure this is the best GPS available and it is very user-friendly but I would recommend against it if you live in the Bay Area - including San Francisco. I lose my signal many times each day - always in random areas and even with the extra antenna (that I had to purchase at an additional cost) I have just as many lost sattelite connections.
4,Does NOT have latest GPS receiver!,"I spent a lot of time looking for a good receiver and eventually settled on this one. I liked the features and the reviews were generally very good. So I ordered this unit and thought that was the end of it. Well, I stumbled upon a website (gpsmagazine.com) and they mentioned units to avoid. The units to avoid included many Garmin units (such as this one) because these units are not being sold with the latest GPS receiver (the SIRF Star III) which is supposed to provide dramatically better results in traditional problem areas (tall buildings, urban areas, tunnels, etc). I confirmed this information with other websites and then decided to order the Garmin Nuvi 350, which has both the new GPS receiver and the other features I wanted. What is really ridiculous is that the Garmin website, even when you compare the units using the compare feature on their website, does not actually show which GPS receiver is being used."
3,Some growing pains,"I love my Garmins. I own the C330 and 340. The C340 is excellent value for the money and does a fine job in directing me towards my destination.There are some concerns that people should consider. The unit takes longer than my C330 to find its bearing - sometimes more than a minute or two. Also, the text to speech is too mechanical and monotonous. It could/should do a better job than one of my kids toys that cost about $20-30.On the other hand, the mapping software is excellent."
2,Satellite Signal Issue,"After reading all the reviews and owning this product for 2 months , I feel that I didn't do a good buy. The unit overall is satisfying, but the problem starts coming after you come out of a underground garage or once you lost signal. The system never aquires the signal and I had to turn it off and on to get the sigals back. This becomes very critical especially if you come out of the covered garages and directly on roads and have no freaking idea about direction. The system would useless as you will taking rounds and rounds of the block till you get satellite signal...big big flaw..."
4,New user,"Good product..compact..out of the box ready..good resolution even on bright days. Routes sometimes are not the best, example: when I program a known route, it sometimes responds with strange deviations which takes you off highways and on to congested local roads with lots of traffic lights. Also when the designated road veers right or left, the program responds with ""turn left or right"" when you're really just following the curvature of the designated road."
4,Good unit for the money,"After reading many reviews for this product, I decided to buy not only one, but 3 of them (for 2 of my friends). For the most part, I am quite satisfied with the performance. I do have trouble whenever I try to type in the name of a location (not the address, but the actual name). It seems to freeze without finding it even though I input the city & state it's located in. This could be quite frustrating when you don't know the exact street address.The map is very clear and easy to read and the voice commands are clear and loud. I would recommend this model over the C330 (the C330 doesn't speak street names) because you don't need to glance at the map as often when you're trying to keep those eyes on the road. Just listen to the voice prompts and you'll be fine. A good buy for the money!"
4,Garmin SPC-340 is really a good GPS,I have this GPS for the last couple of days and i really love it. The overall look-n-feel plus the functionality is amazing. The only drawback i found is that the map needs to be current. It missed some points plus sometimes it takes a little more time to find some location.
4,Garmin Streetpilot C340,"I find this product to be very helpful and easy to use. however, I have found several addresses that the Garmin didn't recognize in my travels."
3,Just didn't have a chance,"The Garmin's size is great, but I had a Magellan before and went back to it. It returned the Garmin c340 for a Magellan 760."
4,Budget Entry GPS system,"For the money it takes is a fairly good device that I can't live without anymore.Nice and crisp screen, clear voice messages, so far no major errors in maps, in summary, a must-have gadget to nowadays.POI upload works seamlessly however you can't set more than a single waypoint while navigating through. No back-tracking either. Minor things like changing you zoom view when approaching next turn are excusable for the price that's being asked for.Don't miss the opportunity to add POI (points of interest) to your little machine by searching Google for various sites that provide food and retail stores locations for free done by other happy Garmin customers."
3,Jill is Slow,"I have this since 6 months now. In an effort to make it personal, the company ahs given the user options on picking certain female navigator voices to choose from depending on the accent you prefer. Fro example there is an American called Jill who can navigate you or if you prefer an Aussie, you can go with Karen. I like this feature since I can call my machine by a name.However, Jill can be very slow and moody in downtown areas. I drive in NYC and she is useless there. Also, there are areas in the burbs where she can take a long time to locate satelites. She doesnt give you choices of ""whether to take HWYs?"" or ""Non- Toll Route"" etc."
1,Nightmare !!!!!! STAY AWAY,"The people who rate this 5 stars have no clue what a good GPS is.This is the same unit National Rent a car uses. My group and I are frequent travelers, each renting cars 3-4 weeks per month. We all HATE this system so much we moved to Hertz, even at a higher price. This unit got us all lost so many times I cant keep track. Last week I got stuck renting National in San Antonio and again totally lost twice in one trip. ""you have arrived"" to an empty lot in a ghetto an hour from my destination. Again returning to the airport. Same thing in Seattle, Huston, Pittsburgh, ect. And we all have similar stories.Want to find a local restaurant? I won't just list all in the area, you have to choose the type, American, barbeque, Japanese, ect. I can go on.. good luck"
2,works well when it works,"I mainly had problems REPEATEDLY with the charging cord. at first, it stopped charging . then I used a USB cord to charge from my computer. now nothing works. the battery is dead.replaced a charging cord , quit working again.. very frustrated."
4,A must have.,"The GPS works well with only a few problems. When you enter in a town some times it comes up with the wrong one and will not let you correct it. Their are ways around it, you just have to use the map function and pinpoint the location that way. It makes for a nice side seat driver, one that knows where it is going."
4,GARMIN NAVIGATOR C340,"IT WILL ALWAYS GET YOU TO YOUR DESTINATION, BUT NOT ALWAYS IN THE SHORTEST DISTANCE. SOMETIMES DOES NOT GIVE ADEQUATE WARNINGS WHEN TO MAKE TURNS. IF YOUR DESTINATION INVOLVES A ROUTE NUMBER YOU CAN'T USE IT TO GET TO YOUR DESTINATION."
5,We call her Hillary,"Enjoy our new GPS System. It was very easy to install and use and is loaded with useful information. We particularly like how easy it is to program in where we are going. My friend was so impressed she bought the same model. We do not subscribe to the radio station, but just use the system as is - one time cost."
1,Discontinued Product - Do not Buy,The Garmin series c340 has been discontinued by Garmin about an year ago. I found this when I was registering the product on Garmin's site.Surprisingly Amazon does not mention this fact even once in the product description.You will be much better off buying a newer model.
5,Garmin Streetpilot c340,"I purchased this for my husband as a Christmas gift..and now we fight over who's car it will be kept in!We just love it...and recently took it on a trip with us to Florida.Being in unknown territory, it worked like a charm! Getting us to and from the airport with ease, plus all the little side trips and restaurants during our stay were a breeze.The only thing we didn't get was the leather case for carrying, which I found out from a friend, was available for this unit. I would recommend getting that if available."
5,saved me in downtown D.C.,"I purchased this product after getting a job in Washington D.C. and was tired of getting lost downtown all the time. It saved me from the meltdowns I used to have and got me to places painlessly. It was super easy to use, and now I can enjoy the scenery while driving instead of having panic attacks."
5,Very User Friendly,"The Garmin StreetPilot C340, my not be the latest thing on the market,but it works great, Just put in the address where you want to go, & it takes you right to the location. I wish I had one of these, 20 years ago !!!Thanks Garmin & Amazon.........A. GrayIndiana, USA"
4,Streetpilot,"This is a very nice unit. It has a few drawbacks. It takes a long time to locate satellites. It does not give you options like fastest route versus shortest or most use of highways or avoid tolls. The unit can be used in multiple vehicles but you need to buy a separate mount for each as the mount is glued on, not suction. Overall I am quite happy with it in spite of its limitations."
5,Garmin c340 street polite,"The c340 is an excellent product. It is easy to use and navigate through the program. I like the mounting setup how the adapter attaches to the mounting bracket not the gps itself, it just makes it easier to mount and dismount. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend the c340 to anyone."
4,Great transaction,"Great transaction,seller shipped just within Amazons alotted time to ship or at least thats what they told me when I called to see if they had even shipped it."
4,Good but doesn't work in New York City,"I live in the suburbs and the unit works great. One of the main reasons I got this is because I like to make frequent trips into NYC and thought this would be useful. Wrong! It immediately loses reception once you get near any tall buildings. Overall, it's worth having but don't expect it to work in cities."
4,Good,"So far I am impressed with the C340 street pilot, it works great and will continually recalculate if you miss a turn. Some devices stop recalculating after a few tries. Only one con is that I was in an area of town where the device got completely lost and kept recalculating only to have me end up in a completely incorrect destination. I will blame that on the subdivision being new, maybe as it was only 2yrs old. You would think the signal should have picked up the new area in 2yrs. Overall this device works great."
5,street seeker,I would say that this product is the best to have.I and my wife don't need a guideperson to show us around town.With this GPS you can go anywhere and not know the city or stateand just hang out hit the GPS and tell it where you want to go and bingo you are on your way there. Don't leave home without it!!!!!!!
4,Garmin Streetpilot C340,"This unit is easy to use and requires virtually no set-up. It is very responsive with positional updates every few seconds. The level of available map detail is impressive and reasonably accurate. I did note that several road and street names were incorrect and roads commonly referred to by name were often designated SR or CR. SR and CR numbers are not easily readable on road signs at intersections. Given those relatively minor issues, I found the unit useful and user friendly on a recent 3000 mile road trip. Garmin needs to provide map updates, since roads modified within the last year (e.g. sections of US 15 in PA)are not in the unit's map database. That is also true of most newer motels (e.g. Holiday Inn Express motels are largely absent). In summary, I am pleased with the C340 and would recommend it."
3,Good entry level unit with text-to-speech,"This is a good easy-to-use GPS unit with a crisp touch screen and a good mounting system.Voice is good without text-to-speech. However, when using text-to-speech, the voice guidance is not very clear and loud.The map is OK. It worked pretty good during a long road trip, but it gave me bad directions that kept me driving around narrow streets time and time again when I was only 10 miles from home. I had to drove about 5 miles back to the roads I usually took without GPS.Overall, this is not bad for the price."
3,"Good, but could be better","I've own the garmin c340 for 8 months. when i first got it, it locked up 3 or 4 times. after about 7 months i finally went to the garmin website, they claim to have a fix that you could download. i have downloaded the fix and it has not locked up since. this device is good if you are lost, but, 80% of the time it will take you the long way. garmin also claim they have a download to fix that, but on my 340 the problem is still there. the 340 does give you the options for the fastest or the shortest route, but, no matter what you pick, 80% time you're going the long way. when you go to the garmin download site, your 340 Automatically downloads all updates. also the 340 is hard to see in in bright sun light, has alot of glare. having said all that, i am still happy with mine. last but not least----the price WAS NOT RIGHT."
2,Spend the extra $50 and go for the c550,"The c550 came with a car rental and I loved it. I did the research and figured I would save a few $$ and go for the c340. Bad move - I returned it and got the c550 instead. The 340 does an adequate job but: 1) mount kinda sucks (compared with the 550), 2) it's SLOW at aquiring satellites and finding POIs, 3) the GLARE ON THE SCREEN IS HORRIBLE.The c550 comes with anti-glare screen, FM traffic adapter included(!), rocket fast, and has a great mount.Do yourself a favor - I wish someone had told me."
2,"can't pick up signal in Ottawa, Canada","The GPS couldn't pick up the sattelites while I was in downtown Ottawa, Canada. Afterward, it couldn't pck up any signals even we are in suburd of Ottawa with no high rise building. In the states, the GPA works fine."
4,All the things I needed,"I bought this recently and it has all the features that I needed. I don't want to have MP3 capability, and all other except the GPS and this is the exact thing I needed. Voice is perfect and screen is good."
1,Battery died in 4 months resulting in GPS ltrying to locate sat for 5 mins,"Worked fine for 3 months and then it started to shut itself down during summer saying something like - temperature too high unit shutting down. btw, I live in northern CA where it does not get as hot as some other parts of the country. Then the built in battery died (5 months after the purchase). Since then the unit took at least 5 minutes (sometimes up to 10 mins). Lived with the problem for 6 more months & then returned it for a full refund. I won't say the name of the store but you all know which store would take a product back after 11 months & give a full refund without any hassle.This is the second GPS that had a problem (first one was a Magellan which fell down from the windshield & broke the screen. Got full refund for that too). So, I would suggest people to buy any GPS from a place which has liberal return policy."
4,"No frills, convenient and effective","Is a little bulkier that the nuvis but then I wan't really planning on carrying it in my pocket.I frankly like this better than the nuvis (bulkiness apart) since the volume control is independent of the screen and I find myself adjusting the volume often and don't like to navigate the screen menu everytime for it.The usual options for navigating are pretty user-friendly for the most part. No complicated screen navigation, pretty intuitive menu options.My only crib is that I have on occassion found it to be slow in picking up satellite reception - mostly under bridges or in the woods. This problem also occurs when there's a huge change in location since the last time it was turned on (e.g. you turn it off and then back on in a different city altogether)But all in all very good value for money."
5,Excellent buy for the money,"I researched online and in stores for quite some time before deciding on this GPS. I would have preferred one smaller, but wanted one that actually said the street name to turn onto, as my husband has trouble looking at the directions on the screen while he is driving. The smaller ones that have the voice speak the street names are much more expensive so we bought the Garmin Street Pilot c340. The screen is nice and large, and ones with a larger screen just put more stuff on them, so the writing was smaller. It sticks to the window great, and you can charge the unit with the plug that attaches it to your computer, so you don't need a separate charger. The option to add you own personal points of interest is great. I went on a free website and downloaded all of the restaurants and stores that we use onto the Garmin. For the money, and even considering other more expensive ones, I would definitely recommend this one to everybody."
1,garmin c340 street pilot,Wow and WOW! I didnt get the same machine as many of the reviewers here. MC340 did operate out of the box. BUTTTTTTTT- //////////////////The maps for my area are seriously out of date. From my house to the hospital it wants to take me through the middle of the JMU campus or on roads that havent existed for at least ten years. I go online to see about map updates and they are not available. Sometimes it even tells me to make a turn on a road that is perpendicular to the one I am on??? I would be very hard pressed to recommend this to a friend or to buy another Garmin product.Roger-Harrisonburg VA
2,c340 very poor choice,"Purchasing the 340 was a bad choice. Without a map I would have been lost. When I typed in Broadmoor Ave. it would override this and go to Broad St. The 340 would shut itself off after a few minutes so it was useless. The 340 doesn't give the option of shortest route vs most interstate. At times it would give directions that were 60/70 miles out of the way. It doesn't recognize major highways in some areas and takes a lot of time to recalculate. At one point we were actually parked in the driveway of our destination and because we had taken a shorter route it was still trying to direct us onto a different route. The next morning it did recognize that we had in fact reached our destination. I used a Magellan unit in a rental car, it had many features that the Garmin lacks. Best Buy or Radio Shack have a thirty day no hassle return policy. I hope I can return the 340, it has been a major dissapointment."
2,stopped working,"We got to use this GPS by Garmin twice before it just stop working, had to send it back to the company for repairs in two months time had to pay for shipping. Waiting on return."
3,Service Issue,"Read all the reviews, did my homework, bought this in Aug06. Wonderful while it worked and one day it was dead, DEC06(right before a trip!). First contacted tech support by email (6 day turnaround), called (30-35 min hold time), emailed again. Still waiting for a RMA #. Unit is 4.5 stars. Customer Service 0."
5,Fun with GPS,"I thought we didn't need a GPS, but my husband aka Gadget Boy had to have one! Well, we've used the Garmin on two trips and also loaned it to friends for their vacation. We all think it is amazing technology and the Garmin is extremly easy to use. Very simple to communicate with, very accurate in guidence and efficient with instructions. Much more effective and safer then trying to follow a map or written directions. We loved the assist with finding food, coffee, fuel etc. If you drive in unfamiliar territory and can afford one buy one."
5,Delivers right out of the box,"I just received the Garmin c340 after reading the reviews on many other units. The box includes a very simple 'getting started' guide, a USB cable, CD, mounting bracket, and GPS unit.It took me about 5 units to unpack this baby and have it fully functional in my car. The setup is a snap, the user interface is simple, yet functional, and the directions have been great. I highly recommend this product and I am impressed with the simplicity and thoughtful design.Have fun."
4,Review - Garmin C340,"While this device has proved valueable - it did not contain up to date mapping of the area that I moved into. This shortcoming was not known to me prior to purchase, which would have influenced my purchase."
4,Smart Girl,"Garmin Sreetilot C340 is one of the examples how far the technology has gone. You can travel without stress or reading maps wherever you want with ""Jill"", voice that gives you directions. The only problem is that if you drive while an upper level of bridge is above you or you have any kind of obstacle above and you have a ramp in front, you lose the satelite connection and you don't know if you will take right or left. However, if you take a wrong way ""Jill"" will recalculate and give you new directions in a few seconds. A friend of mine calls her ""Smart Girl"". I feel very relaxed when I drive with Garmin Street Pilot."
2,Dont Buy!,"This unit lacks the most current GPS receiver, SiRF's high performance SiRF Star III chipset. This receiver has made it possible for reliable GPS navigation even in dense urban environments, behind tall buildings, in canyons, etc. Virtually all new GPS units use SiRF's receiver, and this should be a deal-breaker for any new GPS you buy. Trust us, you'll want SiRF onboard - performance is superior to prior GPS receivers."
3,quention of reliability,"Since I purchased this item on 1/26/07 I have had to reset the system entirely (with help from tech support). The unit has shut down for no apparent reason, I must calculate the program after every other use. I replaced my Garmin street pilot with this unit and am beginning to regret the move."
2,"Bulky, outdated map, not accurate","Pros: It says how long to drive before another turn after making a turn. For example: ""Turn left at street and drive 5 miles"".Cons: Very bulky. The suction mount failed after a month. Bad accuracy. The Garmin C340 can never differentiate between the right lane of a highway and service road. Even after driving few miles after merging in highway, the Garmin says to enter highway as it thinks I'm still on the service road.When traveling to Oklahoma, some of the maps were messed up. It said exit 21 for exit 691. I don't know how the exit numbers are completely off for some state highways.Other Thoughts: Compared against Pharos 150 which is a lot better than this."
2,Don't buy,I gave this to my son for Christmas. It stopped working today. Less than one month. Now what do I do???
1,Horrible,"It gives the WRONG directions almost every time. It tells me that a destination will take 3 hours when in reality, it should only take 1 hour. Tells me to get off the wrong exit. Very stressful when you have a young child in the car.Customer support e-mails have not been responded to."
2,useless,"ill rather keep checking maps on the road they are more acurate and fun, i dont know if its because the program in my gps is dated 2005 but in the south esat coast of florida with all the new developments the machine keeps givin me crazy routes or is unable to give me a route at all"
2,Beware of the volume,"I have no major problems with the navigational ability but please beware of the volume. In all English and French voices the poor volume even on maximum meant that the unit could not be used with the radio on at all, nobody could talk and all windows and sunroof had to be closed. The Hertz rental GPS was much better in this respect (Magellan). If you do buy this please test the volume on day one and decide whether you can live with it. I just had a minor collision caused by glancing at the screen for a moment when the voice should have sufficed."
2,"C340 Fine, crappy order fullfilment","The Title says it all.The Garmin C340 is fine. What was sub par was how long it took the order fullfillment process to work. It appears that Amazon Super Saver orders have a hidden cost and they really want you to pay extra for what most online businesses consider processing invervals.Unless Amazon is significantly cheaper, will purchase from other online venders."
3,Garmin StreetPilot,The images and data are about ten years behind the times. One is unable to program to a city without a specific address. Everything else works well. I'm not happy with it.
3,GarminStreet Pilot 340,"The product looses its satelite signal frequently even after having added an external antenna.When identifying roads, it uses the historical road name (Chadborn Rd)insted of the official local, state (Maine 35) or federal highway number. This is very confusing since most major roads are identified by number - as in US 302 or Maine 27.I've only had the unit for one month and have had to ""Reset"" it twice as a result of it locking up.I have had one occasion when the unit directed me to take an impassable 4WD road to achieve the shortest route to my destination. The roads involved actually exist but are not passable - especially in the winter."
4,Great Product,Very accurate. Finds sat quickly. Easy to use while driving (I can get to what I need at a stop light). Only 4 stars because it lacks some of the features that are nice to have. I would like to be able to do some of the functions and have more of the details I have on my other Garmin units. If you want easy and accurate you can't go wrong. I qould purchase again...and it's worth spending more to get the spoken directions.
3,"Great unit but no satelite signal in manhattan,confused with North and South","The Garmin c340 is a great unit now that Garmin finally fixed The lockup problem with the firmware update on there site.however,i find that the unit loses its satelite signal when i am in Manhattan(maybe because of the tall buildings,but other GPS systems seem to work there),as soon as i get to the theatre district there is no signal,I emailed Garmin and they said to get an external antenna(isnt it easier for them to just fix the problem,also,the unit gets confused when you are on a service road next to a highway,it does not know which one you are on and recalculates,i still love my 340, but not in Manhattan. Since the firmware update,the voice directions also get confused with north and south,several times i was going north and it was correct on the screen but the voice said we were going south and vica versa."
2,"Horrible performance in ""county"" type roads","I was quite excited using this product in large town settings but was horribly disappointed trying to use it on the back roads of Connecticut. The device kept losing satellite connecticity, took a huge amount of time to regain connectivity, did not recognize the street(s) I was on frequently, was slow responding when I made sudden turns, etc: etc: I tried it both ways - i.e. fastest time and shortest route but the results were no different. I had to return this as it was pretty much unusable."
4,Garmin Streetpilot C340 Review,"Before buying I compared the Streetpilot against the C320, C330, Magellan, and Tom Tom GPS systems and decided the C340 was the best buy. I wanted something that would be simple to use. Straight out of the box the C340 was ready to use. What impressed a co-work was the fact that the programmed maps had updated street names that had been recently renamed. Although it has an internal battery it comes with a DC adapter for the car. It does not come with an AC adapter but you really don't need it. If you have the unit connected to your PC for updates the unit is powered via the USB connection. The first day I fully charged the unit battery through the USB connection. There is one big disappointment with this unit and that is the so called 6 million points of interest. If you plan a trip and decide to make some stops at points of interest along the way you might want to call ahead because they might not be in business anymore. Overall I'm pleased with the product."
3,good for the $,"pros. great for finding places around town! purchased factory refurbished for 130.cons: traveling out of town not so great. lost sat's under clear skies and small screen, don't think 5"" screen anybetter, hard to locate places by map. gps sensor not very sensitive/accurate. driving on feeder road still shows as being on freeway. laptop streets much better for out of town"
4,Street Pilot c340,Lighter and easier to operate than one I had several years ago. Very user friendly and very easy to set up. Much quicker to locate itself than the previous model.
5,Garmin is tops!!,I bought 2 as gifts and they are loving every minute of their travels with the GPS!!
4,very good,Just gave this as a Christmas and my mom hasn't had much time to use it but so far it has been very useful. It does come ready to use straight out of the box and is very user friendly. She isn't very tech savvy and was able to use it right away. It gave the wrong directions one time but it was clear that the directions were messed up so re entered the address and it worked better.
5,Value for GPS,"This is a great starter product for the GPS novice. Includes all necessary information for US, including options for local lodgings, fuel, attractions, and food.I have always used traditional turn by turn directions from the internet and AAA and prided myself on a good sense of direction...but this product was a welcome addition, nonetheless!"
5,I just love it !,The Garmin C340 is very user friendly and is very accurate. I would recommend it to anyone.
1,Got A Lemmon,"Item lasted 30 minutes, till after the batter died. When I went to recharge the item wouldn't recharge at all. So I returned to Amazon for a new one. Hopefully the next one will be better."
3,Entering of Address Location too lengthy of a process,"This worked fine for navigation once you had your location entered. To enter an address it was like trying to text message on a cell phone. That is why returned it. I now use MS Streets and Trips on my laptop...much easier to enter location data and with the 17"" screen much easier to see. Although, I do miss the SPOKEN Street names in the voice directions of the Garmin StreetPilot."
4,Excellent except charging battery,"I have used this navi for 2 weeks.This navi is excellent finding satelite so quick, navigation is accurate and easy to operate. As for navigation, it earns 5 stars.What I don't like with this navi is that it does not charge the internal battery as long as I'm using it. In other words, I have to drive with this navi powered-off in order to charge the battery. Otherwise, I have to take it to my home and charge it with AC adapter, but AC adapter is not included. hmmm."
3,Garmin GPS,"I am mostly satisfied with the function, however, the maps are way behind the times. When I say way behind I mean years behind. Dallas and Fort Worth are growing quickly so this GPS is often not of good service to me. I feel I paid a premium price for a standard GPS."
3,"Get what you pay for -- average price, average GPS unit","This unit is best for rural areas, as it doesn't get very good reception in large cities (Boston downtown for me). Additionally, the maps that ship with the unit are very outdated, resulting in the unit calculating routes that are far longer than they should be when navigating highly urban areas.Also, you MUST buy the Garmin dash mount kit (sold separately), as the suction cup mount provided with the unit is utterly useless."
1,I'm lost but it says I'm there,So far I have done a hard reset and uploaded the updated map set twice. I still get wrong directions as I approach my destination. I should just know if it tells me to turn right that I'll need to go left when I get to the street I'm looking for. Going out of town again this weekend. If it gets me lost one more time I'm returning it when I get back - assuming I don't end up in Deliverence 2007.
2,"Maps are outdated, and old,","Bought this product November 2006. I live in Jacksonville Florida. The GPS unit does not know of streets that are up to two years older than the Sept 2006 release date of the internal loaded MapSource software.No updates are available from Garmin.Gets lost and provides bad directions most of the time.Wish I could return it. Works most of the time, but is wrong enough to be annoying."
3,garmin c340,this garmin is worth the money but you would be better off with the nuvi 350. The c340 is bigger and it doesn't really fit in the glove compartment or armrest when you're not using it. the nuvi 350 has the same size screen but is smaller and fits in your pocket and comes with an AC adapter. They both give the same directions. The nuvi 350 actually takes a long time to acquire satellites when you first turn it on. The c340 fell off the windshield twice already while driving. I think the suction cup could be better.
2,Good and Bad,"First of all the good: the device works fairly well.Only fairly well, because it is routinely confused and tells me to bear right when it should say left. (there's a three spots going down into Tacoma and another by Bellevue which I always have to watch close)The bad part? Updating the software and/or the maps is confusing, if it's even possible at all. An hour was as long as I was willing to devote to the task before I gave up and just accepted that whatever maps it came with, that's what it'll have until I throw it away. What should have been simple ended up require 2 different registrations and 2 different codes on their website before they would release current maps. (Who do they think is going to take their maps, that doesn't have their device? The map data is useless without one...) When I finally recieved the data, it didn't work.Typical corporate philosophy: the shorter it's lifespan, the sooner you'll have to buy another one."
4,"Bargain price, outstanding performance","I've had two other GPS systems by Magellan. They were pricey ($350 - $400). They provided what I needed. I purchased this item for at least a $100 bucks less and was expecting ""you get what you pay for"". I'm absolutely delighted. The graphics are far superior to other systems. It is easy to read regardless of lighting (it even changes the entire color scheme at night for easier reading). The touch pad is also far superior. I'd like it if the controls were a little more intuitive but a few uses make that irrelevant.This is definitely a keeper."
4,Garmin Streetpilot c340,"I found this unit to be very easy to use right out of the box. The extensive list of points of interest preprogrammed into the unit make it especially useful. The written manual, available online, is not particularly well written and is somewhat confusing."
4,Disappointed ....,"I purchased two of these as gifts for myself and my son. I have the SP c330 and like it very much. I am upgrading to this model because of the voice naming streets capabilities. I was totally disappointd though when I went to the Garmin website to check on the manual and accessories, I found out that this model has been discontinue. Amazon should have offered this as a discontinued item with a bigger discounted price. At the very least notify the buyer(s) that this item was discontinued. I am however confident that this product will work well for what my needs."
3,"Garmin's website says the c340 is a ""discontinued"" model","According to Garmin's website on 11/26/07, the c340 is now listed as a ""discontinued"" model. However, the c330 which lacks the text to speech feature is still listed as an active model."
1,Get there with ease!,"First of all, the order and delivery process was the easiest possible.I had tried another GPS trip device and was quite displeased so I was hesitant to try again. After my son told me about his Street Pilot C340, I braved a try. The Garmin Street Pilot C340 is as fine a piece of equipment as I could ever hope for. I have tried to confuse it by going far off the recommended path. It patiently announces, ""Re-calculating"" and gives me instructions back to my route. Thus far, I have not been able to confuse it. I am a retired physicist and appreciate good instruments like this one!.Gordon E. Gross"
4,Good Solid Unit!,"We have used it for 2 months and it works good. We have not purchased the traffic ready radio receiver, wish we had many times in stopped traffic. It can be tricky entering address into the unit, I think it is better to pick the city first then go to the address. If you are entering and street and it prohibits you from entering the ""street, Avenue, or other"" you need to click on the bar and they will be in there as choices. If you are on the highway and driving over 55 mph the unit will not be keeping up, you will be missing your turn at 65 mph on the interstate. It is very compact and much better then the factory unit in our other vehicle. I find the next cross street header to be very useful in the city for those small unreadable signs! I found the computer connection software very easy to input the saved waypoints.would have given it 5 stars if it was faster on the highway! Would buy it again or upgrade to the built in traffic monitor unit."
5,Great product; Much like the Hertz NeverLost,"We had been renting from Hertz for the last 6 years for business and vacation travel. I have tried the combo bluetooth and PDA approach but the wife found it too much to have two different items to manage.We bought the Garmin c340 in mid October. We took the GPS 4-wheeling and found the suction cup mount ended up on the floor after several wash board roads. It fell so hard that one of the claw-like parts broke. (Garmin replaced it with a new one.)We bought the dash mount off Amazon.com. It's three footed pads holds the GPS like glue onto the dash and never slips off.So far, the trip from Colorado to Grandma's for thanks giving in California went smoothly, with the GPS helping us find the motels and sights to see. Finding gas stations was a breeze in those stretches of highways. This trip when finished would be about 2500 miles with the GPS as guide and having not to stop and ask directions."
5,Makes Driving Fun,"We bought our Streetpilot right before a driving trip to Florida, 1100 miles each way. This is super easy to use. It tells us every turn to make along the way, and tells us in advance which way we need to turn so we will know which lane to be in. As we were looking for a hotel or a grocery store, we just pressed in our request and in seconds, we had a list, including distance, and then if we chose one, their address and phone number, and then if you press ""Go,"" it will take you there. It gives you all kinds of other information, too, such as miles traveled, miles to your destination, moving averages of your speed, approximate time of arrival, etc. It really did make our trip less stressful and more fun. It is amazing!"
4,Garmin c340,I bought this for work and my wife keeps stealing it. Anyone can program it.. The c340 has had most of the address that I needed and was correct in getting me there. I even use it in rental cars when I travel. Be sure to get the beanbag type mount so you can move it from car to car. The suction cup one that comes with it is not very handy
5,"Not as warm as my wife, but nags just as well.","I got one of these things with an Enterprise Rental Car on a recent trip to new England. THe interface is very easy to work with and entering text has an intuitive feature that pops up a list of streets or cities when you've entered enough letters.I really enjoyed the female voice commands. This helped me with the loneliness of not having my wife along. Although, the Garmin said ""in .3 miles turn left on main street"" rather than saying ""we just passed main street and I bet you were supposed to turn there"".This unit took me everywhere I wanted to go in Vermont, Massachussets and Connecticut without fail. When we got into down town Hartford in the rain it was a little slow at a couple of intersections, but that just reminded me of my wife, especially the way it kept saying ""recalculating"" after we missed a turn.But seriously, certainly worth the 8 bucks a day for the rental upgrade. Well worth the $200 on Amazon."
4,"Overall, pretty good for the money","I bought this for my husband for Christmas. I researched all of the types and brands of GPS systems, and I came to the conclusion that the C340 seemed like the best for the money. My husband is a contractor and we live in a rural area of south jersey. He's used it several times and it's never let him down. The maps do need to be updated (we had a lot of businesses that went up in the past couple of years) but besides that it's pretty good. I read other complaints that the screen will zoom in automatically and won't let you zoom back out. That hasn't happened to us. It has zoomed out automatically when making a turn, but you can just press the screen to zoom back in. But it only does this once in a while. You can't beat the price Amazon sells this for - it was $100 cheaper on Amazon than in Best Buy. I highly recommend the Garmin StreetPilot C340!!!!"
4,review of garmin gps,"I have found it very easy to use and found it is about 99% correct. I really have no problem with it except for a couple of small issues. First the stored directions for rural areas seem to have some glitches. I would suggest that you do a quick scan of a map if unfamiliar with the area to make sure you are on the right path. (example: in rural Indiana, it had us on the right highway but kept stating we were going south when we actually were going north which was the correct direction.Also, strongly suggest the buyer review the on-line users manual before setting out in a vehicle as there is no written user manual included with system and you have to keep playing around it to discover all the features.."
5,Just Buy It!,"The name says is all-GARMIN. These guys pioneered the GPS thing.Unit works great, and have not had any errors. Recalculates very fastif you miss your exit. I especially enjoy the Austrailan accent voiceoption. Would be nice to have a bit larger screen, but with the voiceprompts you really do not even have to look at it other than to enteryour destination info. Very happy with my purchase!"
3,good in this price-range,"I used to use TomTom before, and this is my first time in Garmin. First thing I noticed was I can't find the next direction from the screen. Other than this, this GPS is good to me."
4,I love it,"I like its portabiity, and convenience, and it works as good or better than the GPS in my Lexus. However I wish it would indicate the actual turn when you reach it, rather than just telling you the next turn. The only other area that could be improved on, in this wonderfull device would be a better selection of voices, more pleasant voice tones etc."
4,Great for GPS beginners,This is a great GPS system for beginners (which I am). I needed something easy to operate with not a lot of bells and whistles. My only complaint is with the lack of documentation for the unit. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a GPS but is technically challenged.
4,Excellent & addictive,"We love our Garmin Navigation system. We recently took her along on a vacation, and drove to all our destinations with confidence. There are a few minor things I would change about how you look up destinations, but this is quite easy to use."
4,Very Worthwhile Purchase,I have owned this product for a month now and can't find any faults so far except the volume could be louder. I drive a fairly noisy company vehicle and have had problems hearing the directions while driving on the highways. I would recommend this unit to anyone in spite of this.
4,Nice unit.,The GPS unit itself is everything I expected it to be. The mounting stand however was disappointing. Purchased in August of 2007 and it's already not able to be tightened enough to hold GPS in upright position on the windshield.
5,A Max Lucado Children's Treasury (3 DVDs),Very happy to have found this at such a nice price. Can't beat Amazon!Thanks! Rec'd quickly & sending it to my granddaughter for her birthday.nrh
5,"Price, advice, concise!","Glink has put together a work here that is worth the price. Her suggestions backed by years of experience will likely save any buyer thousands, but beyond that it will make sure that they get the house that is right for them. She has great grey boxes for the must-know information. My only comlaint is that she has a few too many anecdotal entries, but isn't hard to skip them. A great buy."
5,Older Book but still very helpful!!!!,"This book is very helpful in a way that gives you specific answers to questions you have. I love the question answer format. There is also a dictionary in the back that list some terms that the realtor, sellers or buyers may use that you may have no clue what they mean. Good investment."
3,"Useful, but dated","Don't buy the 2nd Edition! There is a 3rd edition. I bought the 2nd edition accidentally and it is woefully out of date in several sections.Otherwise, the book is an informative broad overview. It is certainly worth a read for a first-time buyer. However, it is short on hard numbers and detailed advice and long on anecdotes and very vague advice that is hard to put into practice. It does discuss all the basic topics. It lacks any useful input or advice on how to deal with the internet tools of today. It doesn't discuss concretely how to value a piece of property. It lacks advice for negotiating in a tough market."
3,"More annoying, but more informed?","I feel like these questions made me into a more annnoying home shopper, rather than a more informed one. Some of the questions are good, but with others, I felt like I wasn't getting information that was important, but I felt obligated to ask the questions anyhow.While I was interviewing buyer's brokers, I asked many of the questions recommended in this book to a broker who had been recommended by an acquaintance. By the third question, he said, ""Are you getting these questions out of some book for how to be a first-time home buyer, or something?""Needless to say, his impatience and attempt to intimidate me did not endear me to him, and that in itself was useful information, but not due to the questions themselves."
3,helpful,I found this book helpful to some degree. It did not cover the topic I am most interested in.
4,More helpful than my father!,This book answered every question my dad couldn't. I would have been lost without it. It takes the fear out of buying a house for the first time and gives you confidence to pursue your dream!
2,Lotsa Filler & Fluff,"This book has a lot of information, unfortunatly 90% of it is made up of useless stories and worthless ""common-sense"" tips. The other 10% was in fact helpful, it's just too bad I had to weed the information out of the 500+ pages when it could have been written in 50."
4,Basics for a new realtor,I think that this book must be the first purchase for a new real estate agent. It shows you all the steps through the sale/ purchase of a house. I've found in it all the questions that my customers ask and sometimes I don't know the rigth answer. I keep it in my desk.
5,First-time buyer's must read,"I fully enjoyed this book. As a first-time homebuyer I needed someone to answer my questions and the author did just that. She gives great examples and real experiences for the reader to examine. She answers questions about PMI and ways to avoid paying it, loan types and common mistakes made by first time homebuyers. Highly recommended and hopefully a new edition will be available soon."
2,Coming from a narrow perspective,"The fact that the author is herself in real estate lends a skewed perspective to her material. I found ""Home Buying for Dummies"" to be much more objective and definately superior in clarity!! I found it rather astonishing that the author did not go into the idea of requesting an activity sheet from the agent or that you should always ask for comp sheets. She wants the reader to place a lot of faith in their agent, and while we can assume she is above board, this is a rather dangerous attitude to espouse."
3,TEAC TR-680RS,"What can I say, it's a tuner with way more options than really necessary. It works, it tunes and sounds good connected to my Rotel system.The setup for auto-tune isn't user friendly, one must use the instructions. What happened to the old days when you could just select a channel and save it and be done??The instructions indicate that when power is removed, the time will require resetting, but the unit seems to keep the time for over eight hours.My unit has a problem with the digital display, in that when power is removed (power strip turned off) and then power reapplied, the display is all jumbled up. One must unplug the power cord and then plug it back in to get the digital display to reset. Bad display ground? Not enough filtering on the display?Anyway, not a bad unit, price was a bit high for what you get. All in all, it works. Now where did I put that remote????"
5,Worth every penny,"We used this on a commercial sound system installation in a public park. Has good sensitivity, selectivity, and quality."
1,Overproduced and Under-rehearsed,"Despite an affiliation with Clive Davis, the boys of O Town have faltered in my opinion. The tracks on their self-titled CD are vastly overproduced, hiding any vocal talent the guys have. More rehearsal time should have been devoted to several of the songs, especially the Diane Warren song ""Baby I Would"". The guys voices do not blend well. I am a huge fan of N*Sync, 98 Degrees, and BSB, but O Town doesn't live up to my expectations. Their story is compelling but it plays better on TV than on CD."
4,Surprising depth,"This group and their fans have high expectations for theirdebut album ...; One might expect cookie cutter music given theirtitle of a ""boy band."" However, the cd was well made and hasa little bit of everything for everyone. ""Liquid Dreams,""the first single, established the fact that the album was not going tobe filled with saccharine sweet ballads that have typified many boybands. ""Every 6 Seconds"" is very catchy uptempo song, withedge and bite. ""Love Should Be A Crime"" is more of a 80'seasy listening type of song. It might be something you might hearon...; with its lyrics. ""All or Nothing"" might be the cd'srequisite ballad, which isn't too saccharine when compared to ...songs. Overall, this album is surprising balanced and has depth thatis not found in other boy band's debut album. O-town has potential tobecome more than a generic boy band with the depth they have shownthus far. This album will surprise most cynic listeners, but willplease fans. END"
3,"what happened to 13th song ""We fit together""","This album used to have the song ""We fit together"" and now it does not. That was the best song on the cd what happened to the song?"
1,failure,A lot of people were looking forward to this album because of the high publicity it got after i bought this album i found only a couple of tracks worth listening the rest were real scrap and i m sure the result from this album would stop such foolish ventures by Mtv and music companies in the future
2,Too Much Hype,"First of all the cd by O-Town got too much hype.The cd isn't that good at all and it disappointed me.It's not in my cd player at all.The only songs that I like on it are All or Nothing,Love should be a crime and take me under. I wasted my money just to enjoy three songs..and they want to be as big as *NSYNC?..it's going to take more than three hit songs to do it."
1,What a dissapointmet!!!!,"I really love boyband music so i thought i would give them a shot. i liked the song i heard on the radio ""All or Nothing"" but what a suprise, their music was so dumb, it was way too predictable and some of it was gross { listen to the song, Every 6 Seconds"" and you'll see what i mean!} i was so disgusted, i actaually took it back that day and asked if i could exchange it b/c of it's crudeness and got an Nsync CD instead."
3,"Good effort, uneven songs in some places","O-Town's first album was good when I heard it, but the song selection wasn't all that exciting. There are some uneven songs in the middle as the group struggles to glide on the more complex material. Comparing their favorite girl to another actor or acting as if they're seeing them on TV make up some of the silliest lyrics on the album. I liked Love Should Be a Crime, The Painter, Sexiest Girl Alive and Liquid Dreams as well as the country-sounding All or Nothing (sounds like any country singer could sing it). And that uneveness went on into the second album, perhaps one of the biggest sophomore flops in music history! O-Town just didn't get very serious about their music career to start with and this album shows it."
5,A must-have 4 everyone!!!,"This is one of the best CD'S i had ever listened to. My favorite songs are: The painter, Liquid Dreams, Shy Girl, All or nothing and We fit together. I really hope everyone will buy this CD coz these guys are full of talent (they r so cute!!) and they need this to succeed and continue with their great careers.The album is full of different rhythms, that's why it's so great. I promise you won't throw your money (well it also depends on what type of music u like) O-town is better than any boy band!!!Just buy it!!!"
2,Even Pop Fans Hate These Guys...,"In all actuality, I have to say I don't like O-Town. At all. I think they're annoying and completely WITHOUT talent. There are boy bands who can sing live 98 is best live, but BSB and *Nsync do very well, also. O-Town, on the other hand can barely carry through with all the synthetics in the world. On top of the fact that they can't sing, their songs are boring and clichéd. Nearly every one is about girl-chasing. There's nothing fresh or inventive.I didn't care for the single ""Liquid Dreams,"" I thought it was annoying. I hate ""All or Nothing"" because #1 They ripped off the title from Cher and #2 It has no Ooomf, nothing to make you say ""Gee, I wanna hear that again!"" They get one star for their excellent song ""Love Should be a Crime."" This throw-back to the eighties is fresh and fun, quirky yet sweet, sassy. It has everything a song should have, and the vocals are very good in this one.Just download that one. There's no reason to waste money on this thing."
2,"They CAN sing, but...","I have very little respect for this ""band""...what did they do to work for their success other than show up at one audition? Most ""bands"" have to work their butts off for years before they get a good gig. Yeah they can sing, and I love the song ""All"" but...I don't have respect for a bunch of cocky guys showing off on some tv show."
1,Where's the 0 star option when need it?,This album is so horrible it shouldnt have even been put out. I mean to torment people with this music NOW that should be a crime!! With its hideous lyrics and horrible musicality its a miracle this was even released. This is further confirmation that the mainsream public would eat up anything with a image. Let me just save myself from this mess and go listen to my Bob Marley and Nirvana albums.
1,They got lucky,"I must admitt that I did enjoy watching making the band so I decided to buy the cd, but honestly the music just isn't good. I fully regret buying it. The voices of O-town just don't blend well together. The majority of the time I don't know what key they are singing in. To tell you the truth, I feel that if somehow this group of guys had ended up together and tried to get a record deal, they never would have been able to. They got lucky and because they won a contest everything came so easy for them when they didn't deserve it. If you like this type of music I suggest buying Nsync, Backstreet Boys, or 98 degrees."
5,THE BEST CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A+++++++++++++++++,I LOVE IT IT IS THE BEST CD EVER!!!!! I LOVE ASHLEY!!!!! I LOVE O-TOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!! BigstOTownLuvr
2,O-Town? Please.,"Let me tell you, I took a break out of studying for my finals to write a review for this group. I am an avid N'Sync fan - I am a 19 year old white guy so that seems like a great life. I would have loved to get into a group like O-Town. But... I don't think that this album is really that great. With all the effort Pearlman put into making a group, etc. you would think the album would be better. But this just comes off as sounding way overproduced digitally, with fixes coming in on their vocals. I don't fault the guys, but I think Pearlman was more interested in getting a show on TV than making a group. They are doing OK, but maybe we can hear something better in album 2. I give them 2 stars for effort."
4,Very Good,"omg this cd is really good. i mean the show ""making theband"" was really good and i watched it every friday, but the cdis even better! i mean i am totally in love with the song""liquid dreams"" and ""all for love"" i mean they arereally up beat and nice. i also think that ashley is a majorhottie. but that doesn't have anything to do with it. but just someadvice: go get the cd because it is majorely good."
5,What a C.D!!!!!!!,"What an awesome c.d I got it yesterday when it came out. I wacthed the show and i love their singe ""Baby I will"" I am so happy with this c.d its really worth 12 dollars SO go bye it!! What a hot GROUP!!!"
3,The O-Town CD is finally out.,"After searching through 1800 applicants, Lou Pearlman picked the best 5. Then why isn't the CD better? It isn't because these guys aren't trying. The weakness of this group, as see it, is that so many factors (looks, dancing ability, ethnic mix) went into the selection that they ended up with a group where all are merely average singers. Secondly, the only stand-out song is ""Baby I Would"" which has been overexposed. ""Love Should Be A Crime,"" ""Shy Girl"" and several others are serviceable, but nothing that really grabs you. I would think Pearlman could afford better quality material, but then the members' vocal limitations have to be considered. I do think O-Town has potential to grow and develop, and there's no doubt that Jacob Underwood has a great deal of talent. This CD definitely makes me appreciate NSync's first and also BSB's first American CD. They are essential pop albums. This isn't. But...it's a start."
1,give me a break,"this isn't music. it's more like noise. all the songs sound the same...so basically the entire album is like one big blur of noise. i don't know what O-Town was thinking when they thought they could sing. this cd is going where it belongs, in the trash."
5,AWESOME CD,"Hey, to all you people that wrote this is the wrost cd ever. I say it is the best cd ever. All the songs are upbeat,and are very good. So Go buy the cd"
1,"Pure, off the assembly line pop....","Comon people listen to some music with soul and meaning. Buy Guns 'N Roses Use your Illusion albums. They rock and they'll blow you away musically. They have guys who play their own instruments in it, and play that very well. Please don't let music like this reign the charts anymore. It is a scam by the record companies for them to make s**tloads of money. They give you this sleek ""appealing"" commercial trash used to fool you and get YOUR MONEY!!! Please listen to real music. Their are starving musicians everywhere around the world who deserve to get paid before these little droids do."
5,otown rocks,"nsync and bsb better watch out. Otowns new released cd rocks. This cd is so great. its r&b, pop, and hip hop wiht a hint of rock in it. The song every 6 seconds song has a hint of rock with the guitars, and girl has r&b flava. and the song sexiest woman alive is just plain old great. You should go out and buy this cd. i give it 5 stars its just so great. Go out and buy this cd if you want a wonderful cd to groove too."
3,O-Town there first album!,Well I am a big fan of O-town from watching them on Making the Band to other programs that they have proformed on. I couldn't wait till this album was out in stores. When I got my CD the other day I was so happy that I could finally listen to it. I'm not really fond of this CD I only like 4 songs on this CD the other songs just don't sound like something that they would sing. I recently came across some other songs that O-town had made and sang but they are not on this CD and I am woundering why because these songs are awesome. I excepted that this album was going to be awesome and I'm not really fond over. Hopefully there next album will be much better.
2,ok,"The manufactured boy band O-town release their debut and to be fair it's not bad but it lacks a lot. First, they have a long way to go vocally, the songs are very standard pop/r&b, the lyrics are way too cheezy (espically on ""girl"", ""sexiest woman alive"", and ""take me under""). And some songs are just plain horrible! Such as ""all for love"" and the total cheeze of ""baby, i would."" Let's see what they have to offer in a few years."
2,-_-,"From reading the reviews, I had expected better of what I ended up listening to. Don't get me wrong: despite being a guy, I do listen to other 'boybands' such as the Backstreet Boys, Westlife, N'Sync, etc. They're actually good at singing, and their lyrics (for the most part) have some meaning. Failing that, they're usually plain fun to listen to!O-town on the other hand.. maybe it's because they're new, but still, from the hype.. I expected more. The lyrics are cheesy, the vocals strained, and there is no originality.O-town may have given some serious effort to this, but they've got a long way to go, and need alot of improvement before they'll ever make a name for themselves. It could be done.. but not just yet."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"This album was horrible. I brought because I felt like giving O-Town (more like O-terrible) a chance. It wasn't worth the money! These guys suck - all the songs sound the same. Does anyone else have a problem with the fact that they're somewhat of a manufactured band? I do, and the music proves that they're just trying to be like Nsync and Backstreet...too bad it's not working"
2,Too generic to be taken seriously!,"I'm a pop music lover and I dig other boybands like BSB and NSYNC, but O-Town's capricious arrangment of songs does little to satisfy my expectations for a debut. I was initially drawn in by ""Liquid Dreams"" (despite the RIDICULOUS lyrics commercializing body parts of supermodels... uggghh) but the rest of the album was a real flop. You can't really expect much from a group put together by a blimp enterprenaur, but STILL.. they could have done a lot better for themselves (I think). This new contender is simply trying to emulate a style already cultivated by sprouting young boy bands. Bottom line: save your $$ & go buy something better!!"
4,ALMOST as good as westlife!,i am a really big westlife fan and if u like them u will def like this album!!!! if u like o-town but have no idea who westlife r then u have to get westlife's album!!! if u like bsb and nsync's voices but get a bit bored of all uptempo and thats why u like o-town so much then westlife r ur kinda group! i swear u will love both this album and westlife!
2,"Buy this if you must, but listen to the BEATLES, too!","OK, I did watch Making the Band, I do like Liquid Dreams and perhaps my age (38) is showing but if you want to hear a band that really rocks, you gotta go back to the boys from Liverpool..."
3,O Town,"The group has accomplished so much in so little time, but I was expecting more out of this first album. The song ""Liquid Dreams"" seems to be a hit, but some of the other songs on the track may not fare so well. Many of them seem repetitive in rhythm and lyrics. I was also disappointed to learn that the song ""Say, Say"" was not included on the CD. I heard a portion of it on the show ""Making the Band,"" and thought for sure they would record it. In my opinion, it is much better than some of the other ones they chose to put on the CD. I guess my favorite song would have to be ""Baby I Would."" If O Town continues as a group, I hope their sophomore release is more impressive."
5,O-town rocks,"They're the new band from Lou Pearlman, who created the BSB and N-Sync. There was a documentary series about them last year on ABC; it will come back in the spring. They have developed into a great and professional band. This album contains ""All for Love"" and ""Baby I Would"", which were sung a lot in the show. The single (that was not afraid to namedrop) shares the same name as the title of this album. One song was written by a band member; it is ""Take Me Under"", and it was written by Jacob. The sound of the band is great. It is distinct, with *a lot* of R and B influence. If you are a fan of the show or the band I recommend it. However, if you're a boy band basher, you probably would not want it, as you would hate their very nature. :("
3,Not What I Hoped,"I bought this CD after hearing the song ""We Fit Together"", and was somewhat disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the guys are very talented in both singing and dancing, but the songs just aren't great.I only liked:1) Liquid Dreams7) All Or Nothing11) All For Love13) We Fit TogetherI wasn't impressed with any of the other tracks on this album. Maybe it will grow on me, and maybe it won't. Either way, I'll still continue to listen to it.I recommend this album to any fans of ""Making the Band"", and if you like boy bands."
5,O-Town,"O-Town is not a very popular group, but they have some excellent music. The song I obsess over, and that is very fun to dance to is Liquid Dreams. It is awesome lyrics, and a good beat to dance/listen to. It has been topping charts, and i have heard it on radio stations all over! Go O-Town! O-Town is the group that was on TV in Making The Band. It took them forever to chose five guys, but now they have the band, and they are doin' great. Their CD is great, and no matter how much the CD might be... get it! It is definitely worth it! (That's why I gave it a 5 stars!)"
1,HORRIBLE,"I ordered this product, and when I finally got it, it was not even the real CD. You could tell that it was a burned CD that they passed off as the real thing. The songs weren't even in the right order!!!!! They dont even match the order of the songs on the back of the CD case, which is also a copy of something and not the original, so you get to guess which song you are listening to. this was a horrible purchase and I will never purchase anything from them EVER again!"
4,Pop Album R'Us,"But that's not bad if you like pop a lot. I like this album, cause I like that boy band pop. Just don't tell anyone at school. But actually to tell you the truth, O Town and LFO are the only boy bands that I like (currently). I don't like the Backstreet Boys and N'Sync. Even though this album does sound like it. So if you like N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys this album is all for you. It incluides the three singles ""Liquid Dreams"" , ""All Or Nothing"" , and ""We Fit Together"". There's a lot of tracks on here, and the boys of O-Town wrote most of their songs. Which is really refreshing since most bands and artists these days don't and just have some pop writer write them a lot of ""single songs"".Oh yeah, did I mention that this band was put together by MTV? A little while ago, they had this show called ""Making the Band"". You know the original version of Making the Band. Not the P.Diddy had, where he made that hip-hop group. By the way it hasn't had a hit yet."
4,"They are all so real...and their CD is awesome, too!","This CD is great! There are so many boy bands out right now, but there's always room for one more, and O-Town is it. Their hit show ""Making the Band"" showed how they got their start and it uncovered everything celebrities have to go through each and every day. Not only is the CD awesome, the guys are so down to earth. They don't let this fame go to their heads. Their maturity and feelings really come out in their songs and that's great! That's really how stars should be. Back to the CD. I already said it is awesome. All of the songs are so real to relate to and I especially like the hit song ""Liquid Dreams"". After all, it must be pretty good. It's been at least #6 on the countdown all week long. Let's keep it there guys!"
5,What a C.D!!!!!!!,"What an awesome c.d I got it yesterday when it came out. I wacthed the show and i love their singe ""Baby I will"" I am so happy with this c.d its really worth 12 dollars SO go buy it!! What a hot GROUP!!!"
4,Good Try!!,"Take a look at the popular boy groups out right now. The most popular ones are nsync and backstreet boys. BsB has been together for about 8 years and nsync has been together for about 5. Time is what makes them sound so polished. O-town has been together for about 1 year, and already they have managed to come out with a hit record. And let me tell you it was a hit for a reason. This is a pretty good cd. If you liked the first two singles off of the album (""Liquid Dreams"" and ""All or Nothing"") you will love the rest of the cd because it is full of hits."
3,Oh-My-Gosh-Town...,"I hate to say it, but I was truly disappointed with this self-titled O-Town debut (which I unwillingly spent $20 on at Sam Goody). I was a faithful watcher of ABC's ""Making The Band"", but the show is deceitful because the some of the songs sound better on tv. It's a decent album, but the majority of the songs are either cheesy or have bad vocals (i.e. ""Every 6 Secs"", ""All For Love"", ""Shy Girl""). It's not all bad though... I still like ""Liquid Dreams"", ""Girl"", ""L.S.B.A.C."", ""All Or Nothing"", and even ""S.A.L."". And I think it's cool how Jacob, Ashley, Trevor, Erik, and Dan all got singing parts, but I don't think that the guys put out something that can hang with the likes of BSB's ""Black And Blue"" or N*Sync's ""Celebrity"". Especially since only one member (Jacob) wrote one of the songs on the album, if I'm not mistaken. With this being their first album, coupled with the fact that Trevor still needs singing lessons, this won't have a permanent spot in your cd player."
5,O-TOWN KICKS N'SYNC BUTT,O-TOWN is the best! And their cd is just as hot as they are. If you ask me its probably the best cd I've ever heard. It has more of an urban sound to it so its not plain and boring like you usually get from other groups like N'sync and BSB.
4,The cd and my favorite song,"the cd is great, I am not sure I would let my little sister listen to the hot topics of the songs but I loved it, I think ""The painter"" is as good or better than some of NSYNc songs, simply the best, the lirics are great, I love the guys."
4,Fan Review of O-Town,"So, here are my two cents on the new Cd O-Town. When first hearing the Cd, I noticed a nice blend of funk, soul and pop, that has helped create a unique sound for the O-Town guys. One of their goals was to make each song sound different and by utilizing their unique sounds through power ballads such as ""All or Nothing,"" and dance grooves such as ""Sensitive,"" the listener shifts from romantic mood to dance mood!! I truly hear the strength of their voices in the awesome harmonies heard throughout the album and love the dance beats that I can't wait to see what awesome choreography moves are to follow. Basically, this Cd is a must have ... check it out!!!"
2,"O-Town, Nice Try","OMG, This CD has just about everything, just all in the same tune! There is no variety of words and all it talks about is how sexy women are!!! If you ask me, This CD is no good. The only good songs are Baby I Would and Liquid Dreams, even that one is pushing it. Besides which, there are only twelve songs. I really liked the t.v show so i said what the heck, i'll get it! Stupids me!"
4,They had the fire they did not just have the help. It wasx g,"I have watched making the band for a long time now and when I got the new CD I was a nit shocked. It's just the beat to all 12 of there songs makes you want to dance.In sexiest women alive you get a totally different beat I just wish they could have different lyricsBut then you Lisbon to songs like love should be a crime or ""All or nothing"" and you really get a sense that these are not just 5 lucky guys who sing corny lyrics. I only wish they had more songs that they wrote because there really good at it. Jacob Unnerved (otown mender) CO-wrote the song take me under now besides that women talking in the beginning its a great song. All and all it was not that bad for a CD they have the skills the looks the fire only quotation now is if there 2ed CD is good or not. Just reminder that these guys at the way it looks wont leave without a fight count on it!"
3,Eh...better than some...,"This CD was better than I expected, but it definitely isn't hype-worthy. The singles are probably the best songs on this whole CD. Unless you're a big O-Town groupie, then I would recommend to just stick to getting singles of their songs."
2,All over the place,I honestly wanted to believe this album was going to be good. I mean here we have five guys who worked to make it. We got to see every little step they took on TV and of course you wanted to root for them. But as much as I wanted to believe I had to face reality. They are an extreme wannabe clone of N'Sync. The album goes from super sappy pop to look at me I can be down with hip-hop/r*b. The music lacks production and the music lacks a concept. The mediocre single Liquid Dreams (have you heard the lyrics!?) and the song Girl are the best songs other than that you're looking at one of the most dissapointing albums.
3,"Tisk, tisk, tisk.","Ok, I gave it 3 stars becuase I'm torn here. I hate pop music but who can say no to o-town? Their music is hilarious!!! If you ever actually listen to the lyrics you'll laugh your [rear] off.""I had sushi in Japan, used to think I was the man."" Erik says in ""Sexiest Woman Alive."" Who got drunk and wrote that?Then they have A LOT of bad parts. They can't even record an album, if you've ever heard the song ""Wet Dreams"" or whatever you'll notice that there is a bunch of static at the very beggining, and no, it's not my CD player's fault.And the one, Like, Jacob or something, the one who's head looks like a dead animal. He wears the same nail polish as i do. That freaks me out.But i still say you should buy the album. Even rockers like myself. If you're a teenybopper, you'll like it. If you're a rocker, it'll be so funny that you'll love it. But then again I may be wrong so think for yourself."
3,O-Town's debut CD,"O-Town's debut CD is good for a ""boy band"". Not as good as BSB's and N'SYNC's first CDs, but still a pretty entertaining CD. In my opinion the best songs are Every Six Seconds, Shy Girl, the Painter, Take Me Under, All For Love, and Baby I Would. The group dramatically improved from the beginning, when they would sing all off key and the harmonies would get screwed up. Overall, a good start, but I expected more from them."
3,O-Town is..not bad,"First off, I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed by this CD. When I first heard it, I was wondering what happened to all of the songs that I heard on Making the Band. I had to listen to this CD a few times to even get a feel for the music. I'm not saying that I totally dislike this CD, because 'Liquid Dreams', 'All For Love,' and my personal favorite, 'Sensitive' are great songs. But what I am saying is that this CD could use a little improvement.I sure don't think they are going to be like the Backstreet Boys!"
3,Could be better!,"This album is okay, but it could be better. I have to say, I enjoyed the show and I'm really pulling for the boys, but this is not their best work! ""All for Love"" is pretty good, but what did they do to ""Bring Me Under,"" now called ""Take Me Under?"" When the boys recorded it in Germany, it was terrific! I downloaded it from Napster months ago! What was once an edgy, passionate song, is now techno-pop, mixed muzak! I am also sorry that Justin's ""Say, Say"" was left off the album. Next time, please, less mixing, more feeling!"
5,The Best cd ever!,I thought this cd was amazing! The music is wonderful and is sung incredibly well. These 5 young men have enormous talent and despite what many critics say the cd helps to display their great talents!
5,O-town's Cd is a great start for them!,"O-town's first ever cd,""Liquid Dreams"" is the a great CD!It is a different,edgy sound to Pop Boy-Groups!This CD is very intelligently made,especially for the first Cd they have ever done!I love ,""Baby,I would""!It is a great slow song!This CD is also a great CD to dance to!I encourage anyone to buy this Cd,especially if you like boy-band groups and pop music!I love it!"
5,Great Debut CD,"My teenage daughter and I enjoyed watching Making the Band and have been waiting for their CD. This is a great debut for O-Town. The Painter is a sure #1 hit, with strong hit possibilities for Shy Girl, All or Nothing and Baby I Would.They should have left You Take Me Under the way they originally recorded it on the TV show. It was much edgier and unique.For you parents out there, Every Six Seconds and Liquid Dreams contain pretty sleazy innuendo for the younger crowd, but the rest of the CD is fine."
3,Blast from the past.,This is a great addition to anyone's Sci-Fi collection. This was a series that relied more on the story than special effects. If you enjoy shows that have depth to the storyline then this is a worthy purchase.
3,It would've been great at half the length.,"Like a lot of people, I first saw a few episodes of this show in the 70s, was fascinated by it, and didn't see it again for over 30 years. I always wondered what the conclusion was and eventually managed to see every episode. Like most, I enjoyed it and accepted its failings in special effects and even the sometimes wooden acting. Some of the stories verged on the ridiculous, but watching each one in succession I got the distinct impression that this show at 60 minutes was way too long. I found myself occasionally going to the fast-forward button to speed things along. There was a lot of repetition and it seemed the writers were struggling to string the stories out. I'm sure just about every episode could be cut down to 45 or even 30 minutes. It would've made for a better paced and more interesting show. I also found it frustrating that (SPOILER ALERT!) there was no conclusion to the story in the last episode. Sci-fi fans should see this show."
2,Another Critic View!?!,"I watched this series over a expanded 6 months, because it's that boring! The only time it was easily to watch was when I had a couple of martinies!!!!"
2,Another look after all those years,"Well I just watched all 16 episodes for the first time after seeing them in their original run in the mid-70's. I bought the DVD fueled by nostalgia, remembering the poor production values, but hoping time had been merciful. The verdict? If you never saw The Starlost don't bother unless you adore B-science fiction for its camp, and even then you'll find the shows more boring than the usual B flicks. If you did see the originals and are considering buying this DVD for nostalgia like I did, my memories proved fairly accurate about what I liked (the great premise, the cheesy but sometimes-clever sets) but things proved much more slow-paced and boring than I had remembered. All in all, I scratched an itch that wasn't worth it."
2,It was great to watch a show from my childhood but,"Hey this was a sctv production no not the skit you see on late night comedy with John candy but the real sctv network. Most of there productions were low budget bad films. But it seemed better when I was 8 years old . I had to get it anyway , hey watch it laugh then you could always recycle it back through amazon ;)"
3,Can you lose yourself in the story?,"Growing up in the 1950's and being a SiFi fan since then, I can appreciate the effort that went into making this series. I liked the theme of the story. And I'm sure back then it was made with latest technology. But let's face it. Nothing compares to today's advanced movie-making techniques. The acting is filled with lengthy dramatic pauses which, in my opinion, seems to account for about half of the show... boring. However, you don't have to think too deeply when watching. I could sometimes imagine (lose) myself in some parts of the story. And that's what made it enjoyable for me."
5,Wonderful series of yesteryear,"It is not the techo movies of today, but the start of alot. It made me feel young again, which in it self was worth it. The series was getting started when it was cut short, I would have like to seen it evolve."
3,SciFi fan flick,"If your a Science fiction fan and are impressed by low budget films that were really outstanding for their day and the budget they had to work with this is a fairly decent movie. If your going to compare it to current tech and big budget films you'll probably find it lacking. Based on what I saw and the budget they worked with, they did some real wonders on this film and I kind of like the story line, people who won't fight for their freedom will lose it."
4,Mr,"As a Kid I thought it was really futuristic and cool. Now that I see it again, NOW, I remember why I didn't feel a great lost when they cancelled it. but, it's in my library, so when I get nostalgic, something to look at. As far as my order from Amazon I am very happy with the service."
3,Star lost,The first part of the series was not as clear as the later discs were enjoyable for its time ended with no solution to the story as did many of the series of that time did.
1,Starloat is lost,"This is pretty awful. The story may be interesting but I didn't watch it long enough to find out. The music accompanying the action is a a wavering high-pitched flute that is completely irritating and ruined the whole series for me. I jumped to the last episode and the same music was there, too, so I gave up on the whole thing."
2,Harlan Ellison,"I'm surprised to see there is no mention yet of creator Harlan Ellison. I've never seen an episode of the show but I read the paperback novelization of the pilot that was issued back in the 70's.I remember very little about the book itself except that there was a very long and entertaining introduction by Ellison about the creative struggles in making the series. Not surprisingly, Ellison hated what became of his creation but praised the person who molded the novelization from his earlier drafts of the pilot script.The story had a lot to recommend and I shall try to finally see what they made from Ellison's original ideas."
4,It is what it is...Dr Who fans will enjoy it.,"OK, this series has gotten such a bad rap that many sci-fi fans think it was the worst show ever made, but it isn't. Ok, so it wasn't Harlan Ellison's Star Trek as it should have been and it was on a very low budget, but that has not stopped anyone from enjoying cult classics like Land of the Lost, Dr Who, Red Dwarf, etc. This is watchable and creative. Perfect? No...far from, but it is not the worst show ever made. It stars Keir Dullea from 2001 and guest stars Walter Koenig (Star Trek) and Barry Morse(Space 1999). It is a fun series. Don't waste effort imaging what could have been and just enjoy it if you like lower budget sci-fi done well. Ellison is that good that the industry could not completely ruin this. The Starlost!!!"
1,Starlost potential,"I remember this show appearing then disappearing when I was in my teens. I thought the premise was great but the actual shows were cheesy. I recently found it again and rewatched most the episodes. The idea is promising but it's compromised by inane writing and soulless acting, poor pacing and ridiculous special effects. I did like the few scenes with the surly computer. You'll probably be unhappy if you buy the CD Set so I suggest renting it from NetFlix first."
2,Chafes and isn't comfortable,"I bought these because they were the least expensive. I wore them on a 4 mile jog and noticed that they were a little awkward and difficult to put on in a way that wouldn't irritate my skin. The next day I went on a 12 mile run and was completely chafed by the end. The velcro strap rubs against your skin and is very painful given time. They did help with my knees, but it wasn't worth it."
1,Wheels can pinch fingers,I bought the battery powered Lady train for my toddler son. He just loves it. Then I bought Bertie at a store closing sale thinking it would be just as fun. However we found that the bottom of the bus falls low enough along the wheels that my son gets the skin of his fingers stuck when the wheels turn. So it pinches him. Ouch! Poor guy. It actually pinched me a couple times. We don't let him play with it. That's why I give this car only one star for fun. If this didn't happen it would be a 5 like our Lady car.
2,Bertie the Bus(ted),"My son absolutely LOVES Bertie, he barely puts him down. Unfortunately when he does put him down, it pinches his fingers and worse yet he barely moves even with a fresh battery. He gets stuck at every track connection that's every 4 or so inches, hills... ha! I do like Bertie, he is one of my favorite characters and it pains me to write a bad review of him."
2,"Nothing that special, just not as bland as most of the genre","2 1/2Mildly impressive set of dance tracks rarely step outside of their methodical pulse pounding ways to show the talent that does make this outfit better then just another DJ. Though the majority are vocal laden, catchy numbers, intercut with a few more eclectic tracks, the album hardly rises above it's head bobbing notions to glue any melodies too the picture. When they are not busy ripping off artists like Depeche Mode (Keep It Coming) or sounding like a second rate Junior Boys, Swayzak moves along enough to merit a listen, but hardly."
5,just right,the item arrived on time and was exactly as described on the website. I am pleased and would order again.
1,BAD - BAD VENDOR!!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!,I ORDERED A DOLL HOUSE FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTERS BIRTHDAY. THEY WERE QUICK TO TAKE MY MONEY OUT OF MY ACCOUNT BUT I NEVER GOT THE DOLL HOUSE. I EMAILED THEM MANY TIMES AND THEY WOULD NOT RESPOND. BAD VENDOR - BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. I DON'T KNOW HOW I WILL EVER GET MY MONEY BACK. AMAZON SHOULD DROP THEM - ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!LAURA GARRETTSAD GRANDMA
4,Great for organizing toys,"This dollhouse bookcase doesn't serve as a bookcase for us. We put our daughters toys in the cubie shelves and it's a great way to display her things so she remembers she has them and we don't have to worry about her knocking over 10 things when she grabs something because of the ""walls"" that make nice cube areas for storage. The montessori teachers at her school would be proud of how we've organized her things with this dollhouse ""bookcase"". I highly recommend this product. It beats a toy box hands down. I only gave it 4 stars because it did take me 2.5 hrs to put it together due to somewhat cryptic instructions. I did finally figure it out though."
4,Kidcraft Dollhouse Bookcase is just what we needed,"my daughter (who is 4) loves this. She keeps her dolls and miscellaneous toys on it. It's sturdy and nearly as tall as her. I think it would also make a fun dollhouse as well as bookshelf, and for the price I paid for it, it's cheaper than a lot of other bookshelves and dollhouses. Great item!"
4,grammy,Very cute with easy to follow directions.Roof is supported with strong hinge when opened.Screws & bolts seem small -hope they are strong enough for grandkids!
5,Solid Biblical Theology,"Written by a seasoned minister, this book offers solid, balanced, biblical theology in this much needed area. I believe this ground breaking book will be a great blessing to many pastors hungry for the genuine biblical article."
5,Best Blues CD EVER!,"One day I walk into a small music store in Agora, California and this CD was playing. I asked the teenage clerk what it was and he replied he didn't know. Evidently, it was a sample sent to the store and the kid just put in on to see what it was. It was the best blues CD I have ever heard in my life. This is a gritty, soul-searching performance by Ward. His guitar is not tuned perfectly, his voice breaks when he tries to hit the high notes, but the result is the most haunting set of tunes I have ever heard.I break this out of my collection of over a thousand CD's at least one a month. Also, I have probably given at least 10 of these CD's to friends who heard it at my house or in my car. (These are copies that I bought -- not made, since I want to support this great artist). If you like Blues then buy this CD. After you listen to it you'll love the blues."
4,BEWARE,"Yes this is a great recording, and Flagstad gives a thrilling performance without a bit of shouting. However, the other glowing reviews might give the impression that this is THE Tristan to own. It is not. It is strictly for the serious collector. The sound quality, which may be remarkable for its age, obscures more detail than it reveals. My choices for a first or one-and-only Tristan are the Bohm, Goodall, or (Carlos) Kleiber."
4,the metaphysics of Love,"Four stars for the singing, especially of Flagstad. Hers was an unbelievable voice: steady, strong, and even from top to bottom, and with a warmth that Nilsson never quite approached. The big downside of this recording is the sound of the orchestra which is well back and not at all clear. Since Wagner, by the time he composed T&I, had come around to the belief that the music was more important than the words, this is a serious drawback. You have to listen to the Furtwangler recording to really hear what this opera is supposed to sound like. Which is just as well since, if you listen to the words, you'll discover that what Tristan and Isolde are really singing about in their big Act II love scene is METAPHYSICS! A romantic guy, that Wagner."
5,Wonderful!.,"Growing up, the Edie books were among my all-time favorites and I read them over and over. I'm thrilled to see that this is back in print!"
5,Ministry of Helps,"If you are truly interested in helping your church this is the book for you. If you need to know why things are going great in your church this book explains why. On the flip side if your church is not progressing the way it should, read the book. Reverend Buddy Bell has written a book that time can not change. He has written a book for today, yesterday and the future. Easy and fast reading. Get it and see for yourself."
4,ORIGINAL AND SCARY,"A very good horror movie, well directed and wonderfully acted. The story - diabolic from start to finish - is very original, although sometimes it reminded me of Angel Heart by Alan Parker with Robert de Niro and Mickey Rourke. Visually appealing and some terrific special effects add value to this weird, disturbing and highly entertaining scary movie."
2,"A slow moving movie about getting what you want, and regretting it. First half slow, second half better. Just OK. I say C-","Is beauty truly only skin deep? A man (Sturgess) born with a large birthmark on his face has spent his life dealing with stares. After a strange attack the birthmark dissapears. With a new found confidence he lives his life like he's always wanted. His life changes again when he is visited by a stranger. The first half of this movie is very very slow and I had to struggle to get through it. It picked up somewhat, and actually parts of it are really good, but it is very drawn out. The ending has a neat twist to it, but it's a struggle to get there. The second half made up a little for the beginning, but this is not what I expected. I wasn't paying that much attention to this movie because it wasn't holding my interest the entire time, but the last half is actually pretty good. I give it a C-.Would I watch again? - No, I barely made it through the first time."
4,Fascinating,"It took me a while to figure out why the author chose the particular voice she did. I kept hoping that as Gal matured, her language would mature with her. It didn't. But eventually, I got used to it and found it hard to put down. She marks interesting themes common to all black girls growing up in America and perhaps around the world: marginalization, early exposure to sex and violence, and of course, inferiority because of skin complexion. The book was an easy read and quite enjoyable. I would recommend it to others."
5,Stand up! and cheer!,Such an inspirational story. Gal had every reason in life to be hateful and selfish and just give up but she chose to rise above it. Three cheers for her! It gives me hope and spurs me on to read stories like hers.
5,A heartwarmig story about a young girl's true life,"Gal is a lovely story about a young woman had to endure a lot of hardships in her life. I think there is a lot to learn, like how much a woman can endure hatered and still love another person. I can't belive she really lived something like that. I can't belive anyone could. I would recomend it to anyone."
5,OUTSSTANDING!,I really enjoying reading this book. It help me to undersatnd my self. I think every one have experience like gal in their home. I do hope you write another book real soon. A great job well done 100% thanks for sharing your experience with the world.
5,Excellent!!!! Highly recommend it!!!,"I could not put this book down!!! It is definitely one of the best books that I have ever read!! For anyone who loves memoirs as I do, make sure you read this one!!"
3,I found myself talking to the book.,"From the first page of this book I knew I was introuble. I joined a book club to lure me out ofmy comfort zone. GAL was on the list. I hadnever heard of it or the author. I got the book,tried reading the book, became upset with theauthor (who through no fault of her own had toendure this humiliation), put the book down severaltimes, and basically had to force myself to readit. I was drained by the time I finished. I sowanted a happy ending but her life where she wasborn remained the same. The day the book club wassupposed to meet was rainy. One person other thanmyself showed up. I pleaded with her to stay so wecouldtalk. I believe that had it not been for her, andthe people at work, my family and innocent passers-by I would have needed therapy after reading thisbook. Do I recommend it? Only for the strong.Thanks for allowing me to vent my frustrationsover this book."
2,Maybe extinction isn't such a bad thing...,"Ignorance, brutality, indifference, self-destruction--I found this book to be an unrelenting, disjointed catalog of the terrible things people can do to themselves and each other. The narrative is unrelieved by any positive lessons learned. Motivation for any action seems to be the immediate gratification of any need or the avoidance of pain caused by others or the rigid conformation to a social structure that demands subjugation of the weak. ""Gal's"" observations about herself and others show little empathy, insight or learning. To be fair, none of it is glorified, but told instead in a very matter-of-fact tone devoid of analysis or judgement. As an oral history detailing the multi-generational consequences of poverty and ignorance, this book succeeds. As a tale of redemption, it woefully fails and made me despair for my species."
4,"Elvis, and his bizzare unknown life.","This slim volume of short stories is an absolute must for those of you who like your fiction with a twist of the bizarre and perverse. Taking 37 fictional episodes from the life of Elvis, Simon Crump warps our view of this 20th century cultural archetype in an intelligent and hilarious manner. Highlights include the execuution of Chris de Burgh on Elvis's orders, followed by resurection and strange talk of stigmata related trauma, and Elvis's bank raid with Roy Orbison being foiled by his pet chimp Scatter. I highly reccomend this book."
4,My fave,"I love this lotion! The scent is good and the feel is better. It is creamy and smooth and not oily, Yeah!!"
5,What a chump I have been!,A must read for all of us underfunded baby boomers. There is something new for everyone. Mazonas lays bare an understanding of why we never got ahead investing I stocks and mutual funds. His reasoning and the math of why index tracking products are our salvation is to good to pass up.What a chump I have been! I payed for my kids education out of pocket each year because I could. Mazonas' explanation of how much better off I would be now if I had used student loans and while funding my pension plan is astounding.
5,Our Retirement Security,"Peter gives a road map to a successful retirement by doubling retirement income. He offers practical advice on budget, planning, investing with details in the uncertainty of the safety net entitlement of Social Security and pension.Following his lessons will probably get into a comfortable retirement. However, it requires allocation of resources. Sadly Americans saving rate is negative. This book only concerns personal finance with no attention to personal health. Diet, exercise and meditation will keep baby boomer healthy. If not, there will be no quality of life to enjoy in retirement despite the advance in medicine. A million dollar pension cannot buy too many years in long-term care, and health care. This is a must read book for the preparation of a successful US retirement."
5,In the Rain Forest,"This book has given many hours of enjoyment for our family. The different textures, rhyming, and fun activitiy make this 8 page book seem like 50. We have read it over and over, and everytime my son finds something new to look at. Great gift idea."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"Actually, you wouldn't be wasting that much time because the video is very short - 25 minutes, and of them, not more than 15 involve any dancing. I agree with the previous review that it is extremely difficult to follow Josie's moves unless one is standing in the exact same position as her, which would be with one's back to the TV. The very few steps she does show are only repeated a couple of times.... Now I wish I had read the previous review more carefully before I purchased the video."
5,Excellent for beginner and advanced students!,"This is a great video if you are a beginner or advanced student. Josie explains the techniques of basic steps thoroughly. I enjoyed this video because Josie makes salsa dancing very easy to learn. As an intermediate dancer myself, I learned many important techniques that other instructors often fail to mention. I strongly recommend this video or any of her other dance instruction videos if you're looking to dance socially or professionally!"
2,Tape Requires Awkward Positioning,"I have recently purchased this video tape. Josie Neglia is a beautiful dancer, and really knows how to instruct in dancing techniques. However, I found it extremely difficult to follow her dance steps by watching the television screen. Many of the moves require that you stand in the exact position that Josie is in, which means that your back is facing the television. I found it extremely frustrating to attempt to try a dance move ""backwards"". The tape was also quite short in length. I suggest purchasing this video only if you have mirrors surrounding your living room."
1,Wow. Talk about a ripoff.,"Unless you are an absolute beginner by which I mean you have never seen live salsa, this video is a complete ripoff. She goes through basic steps that you can learn in one evening at any $5 Salsa beginner's lesson."
4,The Betterment of Unity and Static,I worked at his facotry for 2 years two decades in the past.It is the worst feature film ever watched on my computer.He has a disposition of fright and calenderical thought.If he ever has a thesis put the papers in a vault.Thank You
4,Great book for calligraphy - good examples & ideas,"This isn't a huge book, but I really like it. It contains many sample alphabets using calligraphy pen or brush stroke techniques. (It seems like when I look through most calligraphy books, they don't have many sample alphabets). Although I probably have one standard calligraphy style, I like to dabble with ways to letter differently.Besides offering a good number of lettering techniques, this book also shows some examples of some really beautiful calligraphy works. Some are just simple cards and some would proabably be worth framing. Several examples show how to play with calligraphy and create a visual with the letters on the page. The ideas are absolutely fabulous and will inspire you to explore the creative world of lettering."
1,Too much trouble to adjust and configure,"Pros: If you can ever get the color setting correct, it's a nice display.Cons: I have spent hours and hours playing around with the color, brightness and contrast settings and it's still not right. Also, the display is so bright that colors looks washed out with no contrast.If you want a plug-and-play monitor, don't buy this one. I wanted it for general business use and Web dev and it just eats up my time to get a decent picture. My previous LCDs (NEC, KDS) I could unpack, plug in and have the OPTION to play with the settings. This display REQUIRES that you configure it and it eats up way too much time. I have been unable to strike a balance between good color and brightness/contrast. It's particularly bad with applications (Outlook, IE, Foxfire, FrontPage, Word, etc.). I feel like I want everything bold so I can see it better."
3,blake is dumb,"Hey, BlakeHalo2! You're the stupid one! This is not a game...you're right! But, it includes 9 demos that you DO play! Didn't YOU read the frikkin description? What an idiot! It's not an awesome game...but, a lot of things on here are very interesting to see! And, ""demos"" are PLAYABLE!"
1,YOUR ALL STUPID,WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THIS ISNT A FREAKIN GAME ITS A DVD THAT LETS YOU SEE MANY THINGS LIKE THE HALO 2 TRAILER...... JESUS CANT YOU READ!!!! AND ITS NOT FUN CUS ITS NOT A FREAKIN GAME!!!!
3,"Good Stuff, But Not Worth $20!!","First of all, this is a DVD and not a game (duh, read the title). I got this free when I bought a game (not Brute Force) at the mall. I thought the title was misleading (you would think the entire disc was devoted to Halo), but was satisfied with its content. I could read on the front that it was a disc of extra footage, and had some trailers and demos. The supplements for both Halo and Brute Force were actually quite good (I may buy Brute Force after all). I understand I could download everything, but why should I waste my time when I could be doing something else on the net (like play a game, maybe). This disc is for those people who want instant, skip-free access to the features with a bit of professional packaging. I would not pay more than $10 for this item, but that's why there is eBay!! Finally, I think the Bonus DVD for the 2-Disc Halo music soundtrack is MUCH better (more insight and features)."
2,only for diehard Halo fans,"This is sort of like a special features bonus disc for ""Halo."" It's interesting to hear the comments of some of the people who made this great game. It is also interesting to sort of see the evolution of the game. Still, you should only spend money on this if you are a true ""Halo"" nut."
3,I'm glad I got this as a gift,"I got this DVD as a gift for buying Brute Force. I was hoping to see more Halo 2 stuff besides of what you can find on the web. It only has a few screenshots and the trailer. It has some Halo stuff but again, you can find that in the web.The ONLY thing that I really liked was the Brute Force movies, they are amazing... but I think they are just movies, I would be amazed if the game has such a great graphics.So, if you get this for free, that's ok."
2,Eh,"Except for the XBOX demos, this DVD really isn't work the $20 price tag. The Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2 media is freely availible from halo.bungie.org (the publisher/developer of the XBOX version). Considereing that you can get more demos by getting Vol 3 of the new demo pack for $8 US, you might not want to put any money into this."
2,Don't buy it if you're not a die-hard Halo fan.,"Ok, I like this dvd, but it is not worth the price if you are not extremely interested in Halo. It's nice seeing how they made Halo from the designers' point of view, and it's cool to see Halo demos that they came out with at E3's, but other than that it isn't impressive. Really, if you're not into Halo, you'd be wasting hard-earned cash."
3,"Okay, but fits mattress weird","THis sheet is okay and gets the job done, but I was disappointed with how it was constructed. There isn't any elastic on if and it looks as it it could have been sewn by me - kind of fits like a pillow case, but wit hthe opening down the back of it instead of at the head or foot of the mattress. I feel like I could have bought the material and made it myself. Maybe I'll do that in the future and use this as a guide for how to put one together. All in all it works and washes fine, but not what I expected. I wouldn't pay too much for it."
5,Quality Sheet,I have been looking for a good sheet for quite a while. I finally found one and then bought 3 more. I have two children in cribs. This sheet fits so easily on my oversized mattress. It also fits snuggly on a normal mattress. It's soft (like a t-shirt that's been washed several times) and not see through like so many other cheap sheets. It's worth the money. The colors are nice too.
4,Quite a bit of fun,"An entertaining, if somewhat offbeat read...this is one of those books that makes you lose some of your faith in humanity's humanity, but it also very, very funny...if you like the weird, the bizarre and the sexily strange, you'll like this book."
5,not the usual trivia collection...,"A few things I'd already known, and a *surprising* lot I hadn't, which is quite an accomplishment! Too many books of this sort seem to be retreads of the same set of oddities, but this volume has gone far afield to gather fresh and unusual specimens, And to top it all off, there's a photograph of a man... errrm, how to put this delicately... a gentleman, who... ummm... well, he... he ""has a double complement of Gentlemanly Virtues"". (blush) While I had heard of the case (it's mentioned in the ""book of lists"" I think), to actually *see* the... ah, well, a lot of guys probably wouldn't call it a *deformity*... (blushing again) Anyway, this one's a definite keeper."
4,Addicting brain candy,"This is a hard book to put down. It's filled with fascinating little tidbits about the seamier side of human existence and all its accompanying malodorous history. There aren't many books that I prop in my lap while driving to catch paragraphs while waiting in traffic, but this was one of them. It's filled with fascinating topics and exposes, all the stuff you really want to hear about but undoubtedly were never taught. I'm giving it four stars for those avid readers who will probably not learn a plethora of completely new things (Zaks has done a great job of expanding on many facts you may have read about before elsewhere). But there will be plenty of stuff you haven't as well. Enough to make it very hard to tear this book from your side until you've read the last page."
4,Underground Education,"I already had a copy of this book; i liked it so much I got another copy asa gift for a friend, who is also an educator. The work could do with a littlemore documentation, but it's a great read overall."
4,"Entertaining, mindless fun","This is book is just entertaining, mindless fun. It's not meant to be taken more seriously than that. Anyone who did bought the wrong book. I would recommend it if you have a slight interest in history and definitely an off-color sense of humor."
5,Things you wish you never knew,"This is more or less a catalog of human waste management, sex practices, scandals, and miscellanea from the past 2000 years."
4,Couldn't put it down,"Granted, as basic human being, I can see someone, and myself loving this book mearly because of it's scandalous nature. Scandal, that is what Underground Education really is all about, but how fascinating a read it is, scandal and all.I literally read it through with in a day. I have went back to it many times since. Some accounts, I'll give, seem a little Hokey, if you will, but the book is well worth the price. I highly recommend it. You will likely not find a book with more non standard information. I used many excerpts from the book for a college class lecture."
2,"Great information, but terrible layout","I am in the 2nd section of this book (Business), and thoroughly enjoyed the first (Arts and Literature). Great 'useless' information and trivia, which will come in handy at a cocktail reception. The problem is that in the 2nd section, for about 20 pages, every other page is shuffled with the one behind it (making it essential that you flip back and forth a couple pages to read each chapter - all around pages 60-70, and beyond). This is incredibly annoying, and I've never seen it in 30+ Years of Reading. From Random House, no less, how did this happen?I can't tell if I don't enjoy the Business section because of content or layout, so I'll give the book 4 Stars, and deduct 2 for a terrible layout (giving me a headache, it is)."
4,History Was Never So Interesting,I found this book on a professor's personal book shelf and immediately felt like I needed a copy. Filled with fun facts about everything you thought you knew. Some of the stories will make you want to run out to a library and double check facts (can we say James Joyce's rather private letters to his wife?) and some of them will make you laugh out loud. This book is a great coversation starter and you will definitely want to read cover to cover. Recommended!
3,"Good, but not 100 percent true.","I read this book a few years ago, and loved it. It's very entertaining, and full of ""facts"" that you never learned in school. But in the years since I read it, I have come to discover that a lot of the ""factual"" stories are in fact urban legends....So while this book is really entertaining, it isn't all accurate, so it's hard to decide what is truth and what is fiction. Readers, beware!"
1,Almost Pornographic,"I enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts, but I didn't even make it through the first chapter before I put this book down in disgust. Almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments. As I was flipping through the book, I found x-rated pictures and drawings that I would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book. I never would have bought this book if I had seen it in a bookstore, and I regret throwing it in the trash before I could see if I could get my money back."
4,Very Interesting,I thought this book was of great value if only because it dispells myth after myth on the romance of ages gone by. Some of the facts that the author dug up are astounding at the least. It's a must for any trivia hound or researcher.
2,Disappointing read,"It was my fault; I did not heed the warnings of some of the other evaluations of this book on-line. I thought that An Underground Education would be something akin to An Incomplete Education (4th ed), or at least Reader's Digest's Strange Stories and Amazing Facts (1976). An Incomplete Education is a terrific book full of tid bits of history, science, art, etc. which I thoroughly enjoyed. Strange Stories and Amazing Facts was also full of information ranging from Super Novas to the Loch Ness Monster, and I loved reading this book with my grandfather and still flip through today. Unlike An Incomplete Education or Strange Facts, An Underground Education was neither inciteful nor educational. It was basically a ""history"" of the sexual preferences and perversions of people throughout history, with some titillating pictures of hermaphrodites.This is a book I would have enjoyed at age 14, but not as an adult."
2,Not my cup of tea,It's okay....but the author certainly only see the dark side. If you are looking for a chuckle keep looking.
3,Not worth the time or money,"This book came highly reccommended and I couldn't wait to get started! I should have gotten a hint of it's shallowness by reading the cover, back and front. If you've got loads of time and have already read all of the millions of great books available then go ahead and read this book, but if you haven't don't waste your time."
3,"You probably knew most of these ""educational"" items","I had hoped for more intriguing views or insights. Instead, I read alot of stories with a focus it seems on sex, almost pornoghaphy, religion. Most of these stories, for those that are interested in history, you already know, so if you are into history from the un reported viewpoint this book is no eye opener and kind of slow.If you are a first timer to history from this perspective then it is a good read, but be prepared to be bored by re-treading sex stories and scandals, religious oddities.Bottom line, should have been printed in bullet form, would make a better collection of short stories on historical myths."
3,Good Southern Recipes,The book contains many good recipes as well as interesting information about the restaurant.
3,"As Cookbooks Go, Somewhat Mediocre","While the information about the Loveless is very interesting, a lot of the recipes leave something to be desired. I did, however, just find that the bread recipe (""Bread Loaves"") is phenomenal. The recipe does forget to tell you to put in the egg that is in the ingredient list. Oops. Put it in with the sugar and butter/shortening."
2,Not very good,"If you like your book on an object-oriented language to always list the main objects, methods, and properties as it progresses, this book is not for (or me, for that matter). Nor is it very clear: the diagram of the ADO object is typically awkward. I found Darren Gill and Alex Homer's ""Professional Active Server Pages"" to be far superior for getting me up to speed fast, fast, fast in my ASP job."
3,A good starting point for page developers,"Unlocking ASP is a good starting point for developers. There are literally hundreds of pages of code as well as debugging tips. The book also has a section on developing ASP components that I found quite useful. Also, there are chapters devoted to MCIS that I found useful. The only negative thing that I could say about the book is that there are a number of typographical errors, but they did not interfere with code examples.The other ASP book that I have read was ""Working with Active Server Pages."" I thought that Unlocking ASP was definitely better than Working with ASP"
4,Last two episodes from LiS's SECOND YEAR!,"""The Astral Traveler"" features a good performance from guest star Sean McClory and allows intrepid Will Robinson (Billy Mumy) an opportunity to return to Earth, albeit in vintage Scotland, no doubt.""The Galaxy Gift"" guests movie veteran John Carradine and marks the return of the dark-suited trio of aliens last seen in ""Wreck of the Robot."" Penny (Angela Cartwright) gets her chance to travel to ""San Francisco.""These two episodes, though not as good as the first season's B & W ones, are an improvement over much of the second's SILLIER one."
2,Propaganda,"Supercross/Motocross is always great to watch, and these riders are amazing. But there is way too much of the biography/interview BS on this that we've already seen on ESPN. Just show me the best of the racing!If you've seen ESPN broadcasts of supercross already, you don't need to see this.BTW, when are we going to get DVDs of the outdoor AMA motocrosses?"
1,First Edition Pamphlet?,"I really don't know whether this pamphlet is first edition. I was given the ""Craftstrip Braiding Projects"" in the early 1950's. My pamphlet shows a copyright of 1940."
2,I didn't like this books ending.,I liked the beginning and hated the way she ended the book. The heroine was stupid at the end. I liked Henry in the previous books I hated the fact Moore made a ruin of him at the end of the book. He deserved a happier end to his story than what he got. He's a humiliated washed up physically ruined knight at the end. After all he did for the others in previous books it was a sad end to his story. I don't mean that because he is deformed either. He was a just a such a good character I didn't want to have anything bad happen to him. Expecially since it could have ended up better.
2,I tried to keep reading ...,"I finally stopped around p80. There was no character development of the two sisters (beyond one is pretty, the other smart) - at least by p80 and the knight just spent 80 pages trying to decide which sister (or servant) to sleep with - he still had not decided when I decided to close the book for good. This testosterone driven knight was not interesting enough for me to keep going. Jennifer Blake's ""Louisiana Dawn"" or Lisa Kleypas' ""Then Came You"" or Joanna Lindsey's ""Captive of My Desires"" were so much better."
2,Flex-A -Mag review,What you get is a plastic desk base with an acrylic lens. You have a small viewing area without distortion. Not the clearest view even in the sweet spot.
2,A shame to read this book,"This book had an interesting idea (human summoned by wizard into another world as a demon), but I think it's been done before and done better. Some of the characters were interesting and the author has a great imagination. But the story was slow and the writing was just awful."
5,How I Got My Shrunken Head,"How I Got My Shrunken Head By R.L. Stine/Book ReviewThis book is a really awesome but awkward book. The genera is a mystery/horror.This book is about a boy named Mark who was upset that his friends wouldn't play with him.Until he got a package from his aunt. She gave him a shrunken head that was ghost like.The head was small and wrinkly and old.But personally I would want you to read this book because who doesn't want to read about a ghost like shrunken head. This is maybe one of the best books in the R.L. Stine series. But, the book the k seems to get a little boring at the half way mark. But does Mark die, live or go on a vacation only you can find out if you read this book."
2,"Cool , Not Scary, Good for a 5 year old.....","There is no suspense at all if u want to watch a boring,suspense-less movie this is the movie for you!!!!! read my other review on Cry of the Cat"
2,"It's an okay movie, but not that good.","Let Me Tell You Again: There is BAD ACTING. But of course, the shrunken head looks kind of real and it's not really scary, just entertaining. There was a girl who plays Kareen whose from Goosebumps: Stay Out Of The Basement, and her acting is terrible in this movie, but better in Stay Out OF the Basement.A kid has an aunt who got lost in the jungle of an island called Baladora, and the kid uses a shrunken head to give him magical powers to help him find his aunt. i give it 2 stars for trying to make this a good Goosebump Movie."
3,"Summary & commentary by a participant, now blind,about 1900","Author was present at the battle as an aide to a Union officer. He has assembled in great detail battle reports by participants, and does not hesitate to offer corrections where he sees fit. He wrote the book toward the end of the century. It is reasonably well organized, but fairly poorly illustrated (good period photos, but minimal maps). Slow reading, but ok for those fascinated by the detail of Day 2 battle at the southern end of the field."
3,Examples -- Just the Examples,"I purchased this book because I needed to do a large number of logistic regression runs for my dissertation. It does an excellent job in going through all the SAS code you need in order to write good logistic regression equations. However, I was disappointed by the very limited discussion surrounding the application of the models. Fortunately, it does provide useful references.The book is useful because it goes beyond the SAS user manuals in explaining how to program logistic regressions and what SAS's output is describing. However, if you do not already have a good understanding of logistic regression, (i.e. you had one lecture on it in your research methods class) you might be better off with something along the lines of Logistic Regression Using the SAS System: Theory and Application by Paul Allison. (I have no affiliation with Dr. Allison.)"
3,This is a great start,"To start a career in clinical biostatistics field, with minimal computer background, this book is a great help !"
5,Greatest of All Gems,"This album/cd is the greatest of all of her discography....every song on here was pure Philly Soul. Every song on here is banging. My favorite songs are as follows: First Time Together, What You Won't Do For Love, Ain't You Had Enough Love, You Just Don't Know & the title track...however, First Time Together is my all time fave. The melody is so haunting and soooo endearing to me. I lost this and all my other Phyllis Hyman plus more in Hurricane Sandy. Get this cd- its a must have!Grade: A+++++"
3,It's alright,"This is a CD I have been wanting for a long time. I have it on vinyl. Really wanted this CD. Was a bit disappointed when I got this CD. There were a few scratches on this CD. Other then that it came with ina timely manner. Case is good, liner work was good. Will (hopefully) do business with you all again."
5,"You are sorely missed, Phyllis!","The only bad thing about this album is that it came out around the same time as Anita Baker's Rapture album. Rapture became a juggernaut that launched Anita Baker to superstardom. I believe Phyllis Hyman and the album ""Living All Alone"" never got the recognition both deserved. This album is timeless and I feel that it is Phyllis' best work. The best way that I can describe Phyllis' performance on this album is that she sounds like she is living the songs as she sings them. It is one of the best vocal performances I've heard on an album."
4,Sultry sounds from a divine diva,"I first had this in vinyl which I still do. However, since I do not have a record player, I wanted to have a copy of this album. I love this album very much. Phyllis Hyman had a beautiful voice that is not stilled by her death. My favorite song is Old Friend. It is heartbreaking."
3,A good book as a checklist for Rice's novels.,"This book is a handy one to have if you want a check list and synopsis of Rice's novels published to date. However, if you're looking for a complete listing of all the interviews &/or articles that Rice has done (which is what I wanted) then this book really won't help you much. So, if you want to get a taste of what Anne Rice is all about without spending a lot of money, then this book is for you."
3,Incorrect Information,"Although I read the checklist and found it interesting, I was disappointed when I reached Page 20 to find the following: ""...Pandora meets the Venetian vampire Marius (who created the vampire Lestat)."" Of course we know that Lestat was created by the vampire Magnus, who then went into the fire. I think a reference book should contain correct information."
1,Not Richard Scarry,"This book is the terrible TV version of busy town, not Richard Scarry's brilliant engaging world. The illustrations and narrative do not hold up to the originals."
3,Talk about yer irony.,"The writing is fairly engaging and the topic is covered fairly well, but the graphics are just awful!In fact, the gray-scale images are so poorly reproduced that it detracts from the message the author promotes. And, in many instances, the graphs are so mottled that you have to guess as to what is being shown. Unless, of course, the book's poor image quality is part of the lesson. In which case it's a brillant ploy to get the point across.Reasonable book - really lousy pictures!"
3,Not my dogs favorite.,I was so excited to find a bungee toy. My dog loves to pull out strings on toys. This doesn't really bungee that much and he doesn't really want to play with it.
3,Loved to death,"Noodle, my five pound miniature dachshund puppy, systematically removed the face of Reba in less than one week. The leather-like nose on this plush was busted through on the first day. However, during the one week that this toy lasted, it was absolutely his favorite."
5,happy dogs!,"They last a long time, they are great fun for my two dogs, one of which is a Great Dane and the tug of war battles they have with this thing are EPIC!"
3,Rottweiller plus dog,"Could be larger, I'm smaller to Chihuahua. Is large plush dog, and sent to donate for SSPCA.Could the bigger dogs and have caring for the toy."
5,"A ""need to have"" for Titanic fans",I bought this book when a temporary Titanic exibit came to the city where I live. I met the editor and had him sign my copy. When I got home and read it I discovered many interesting facts about the Titanic that even I didn't know. This book is filled with lots of true life stories about the disaster. Anyone who is interested in the Titanic just a tiny bit MUST read this book!!
2,"Melodramatic, but interesting to see the 1912 perspective","I picked up Marshall's book after reading other reader's reviews on Amazon, impressed by how glowing they were. I must say I was a bit disappointed. While the book certainly is dramatic, it has many incorrect facts about the ship, as well as the sinking. I did enjoy finding out how the disaster was looked at by some during 1912, but the writing was too ""flowery"" (symptomatic of the times), and some of the errors were jolting. All in all, it's a good book to have if you're a Titanic buff, but if you're looking for a single book to fill you in on the disaster, this would probably not be your best choice. (For a detailed, well researched account, I would go with the old standby, Walter Lord's ""A Night to Remember"".)"
1,Disappointed,"I bought this and several other Gettysburg related books and films to help prep my son for a trip to the battlefield this spring. I did not have high expectations, as the previous reviews were so mixed. But I was still disappointed. Horrible acting and editing aside (I understood that this was filmed during the reinactment and these were not professional actors) the film was impossible to follow. The timeline and details of the battle were unclear as was the layout of the ground. The narrative was often difficult to understand and there were endless scenes of men moving across smoky fields without any explanation. Try another film if you are trying to understand more about what happened at Gettysburg."
1,Poor Movie,"This DVD is quite expensive but yields little to justify the cost. The film lacks any real drama and becomes terribly boring after the first ten or so minutes. The acting is hopeless...really, really bad! Although there are many ""soldiers"" involved in the battle scenes, it's all pretty unconvincing, considering the carnage of the real conflict. In all honesty, as much as I enjoy movies of the Civil War, I'd like to return this for a refund. Alas, that's a prospect that has,indeed, gone with the wind. Thumbs down to this one."
1,Gettysburg 3 days of destiny,This video is a real sleeper. A painfully complete amateur video. The reenactors are trying very hard to reeanact the movie Gettysburg more so than the real event. They try harder to be the actors that were in the movie instead of focusing on the historic personages that really lived it. This video is a complete waste of time and money. The best part about it was the real belly laugh when one of the soldiers actually burst into a musical number without Monty Python to save the scene. This video is nothing more than a reenactor's wet dream with a double side of corn. In a word Three Days of Destiny.......yuucchhhhh!
2,Only For Diehard Civil War Buffs,"If you are interested in learning about the Gettysburg battle, then this dvd is worth taking a look. However, don't expect alot of passion from the ""actors"" because most of the acting is so very poor, that it is barely watchable.More shocking than the cold and dull lines were the appearance of some of the ""actors"". I am not a fan of the ""Lost Cause"", but I was stunned and disappointed to see General James Longstreet and General Robert E. Lee as paunchy and portly. Both men were physically fit and the ""actors"" that protrayed them certainly were NOT!The movie is okay for its cheap price, but anything over $10.00 will be a rip off. I would only recommend ""Gettysburg Three Days To Destiny"" to the most diehard Civil War buffs."
2,I was There,I was one of the reenactors during this event and for those of you who though the reenactors looked uninterested or whatever; the reason behind that is because there were more Confederates than federals. Plus the location this event was at was different than previous Gettysburg events. For cryin out loud there was a stream in the middle of the field where Pickett's Charge occurred. Not to mention that half of THAT field was burned by pyro so we had to march around it in column of fours. I havents seen this docudrama or whatever but i was at the event where this was filmed and the event itself was a farce.
3,"Good, but not for a baby.","I bought it for myself because I love Bubchen products. However, this one is incredibly scented. Wouldn't use it on a baby."
4,Does what it's suppose to do.,"This tool is pretty sturdy and it definitely has a bit of weight when you hold it.I use this to tighten or loosen the board and it does it's job without damaging anything.Getting the tool to align with nut is a little bit tricky but you get the hang of it very quickly.If I lost it, I'd probably it again."
5,SUPER SOLID TOOL,"As soon as my speedily shipped tool arrived i was able to tighten my deck's hardware with the ease I'd been seeking for weeks! I will order at least one more for my fiance's long board, and I recommend two for anyone in need of a sturdy tool like this."
3,4 Episodes,Per the Bandai store description there are 4 episodes on the disc.EpisodesDisband the Club!InstrumentsCram SessionTraining Camp!66 Minutes can't be right for 4 episodes unless each is only 15 minutes long and/or they cut the OP and ED from all but the first Episode.Not going to buy this until I see reviews on the quality and true run time.
1,HOLD OFF,"For the price and getting 4 episodes on a Bluray format, you're better off holding on until a box set is available. Besides, Anime on Bluray hardly makes any difference in quality most of the time."
3,Great Series But...,"First I have to start with saying K-On is one of the best anime I watched in a long time. I am not going to go into further description of the anime itself, as you can find that on other sites.What I wanted to point out is K-On Volume 1 only has the four episodes on it. So depending on how many volumes Bandai chooses to use, likely four for the 14 episodes (maybe three if they compress the video), you are going to have to pay $140 without any discounts. Even with the best discounts you are still looking at $80+ for the series. I personally find that too high compared to other companies Blu-ray sets, and would like to make sure you have advanced warning.If that is not an issue for you, then I think you will enjoy this release barring Bandai messing up the encode, which they are not known for."
3,My kids love this but......,"I agree with the other reviews on this Sir Topham Hatt auto-stop track piece. My kids love making the trains stop at the bumper and then go again when you twist Sir Topham. We also enjoy that this character piece is 3 dimensional as opposed to some of the more 2 D wooden figurines. The price was good on this too, as we purchased it with the battery-operated Thomas figure 8 set (far better value at the time, than buying this piece alone). My biggest complaint with this piece and why I gave it 3 stars, is due to the terrible chipping of the paint around Sir Topham Hatt's head. After several months of play, our Sir Topham Hatt is starting to look like he's radioactive. His bald head has several areas where the paint is scratching off to reveal green plastic underneath (the same green plastic you see at the base of the piece where his feet are). I've tried to touch up with nail polish, but it's not a perfect match."
4,Interesting Book,"This is a great book in dictionary-type format for those who need to know exactly when words came into effect - which, as a professional writer, I do. So this is a guide I keep by my desk to reference as needed. Very useful~!"
4,historical word usage,What a great book! Extremely useful to any writer of historicals or just great fun for anyone with an interest in history to browse in. I would recommend this highly.
3,was thinking it to be more than it was,"Very well done for what it is. However, I was thinking it would be more of a dictionary on why the words/phrases came about. Less on dates and time periods. Should have read the synopsis a little closer."
5,Lo más indispensable de Amalia,"""Conta errada"" y ""Fado Marujo"", de este CD, junto con ""Havemos de ir a Viana"", ""Bailinho de Madeira"" y ""Balada do sino"", del inolvidable y fallecido cantautor José ""Zeca"" Afonso (1987), son algunas de las mejores interpretaciones de esta emocionante voz."
4,travels in southern italy,This is invaluable to prepare for your travels in Southern Italy. Gave a rel feeling for the towns in Basilicata and some history added that was interesting.
4,Smart Wool Hiking Socks,These hiking socks are perfect to put on after a hard days work. but perfect for hiking. The wicking of sweat means little or no odor.. The socks keep the feet nice & warm and they wash well. Very pleased.
3,Hiking Socks,"Ver warm, nice color, does not fit true to form and they slide down. I would have returned them if I hadn't worn them."
3,Too thick color not like picture,The color is a muted blue. I wanted navy blue. They were way to thick for my purpose. Will be good in my snow boots.
4,toasty feet,"I got these with the idea to use on my walking routine that will be part of my lifestyle change. Good fit, no shrinkage so far ,"
4,I love it,"Originally I purchased it to go with my hiking boots, but I found myself wearing it all most daily with my regular boots or even street shoes. It's so soft and warm. I have a cold feet, but it keeps my feet warm all day long. Most importantly, it doesn't leave elastic marks on your legs. I will definitely buy more in different colors."
5,"Awesome socks, but size down","These socks are thick and cushy -- exactly what I was looking for! For now they make great winter boot socks but I can't wait to test them on the hiking trails.One word of advice -- if your size is the lower end of the size range, order down. I am 10, ordered 10-12, and they are a little roomy. We'll see how they do with a wash. I doubt the mediums would've been too tight though."
3,Runs big,Not as pleased with this sock as with the med weight hiker. Runs big. Stretches out as you wear them tends to twist on your foot. washs and drys well.
5,warm and not too thick,"a little thicker than my regular socks for snowy days, bu does not bunch or feel thick in my shoes."
2,Excellent research but a little too biased,"I've always enjoyed Clay Blair's writing style. Probably because he was a journalist instead of an historian. However, as with his book Silent Victory, he can't help injecting his personal biases in the narrative. Blairs interest in U boats came about when his boat the USS Guardfish was docked next to Erich Topp's U 2513. That was later used as a target by the U.S. Navy. The U 2513 was a type XXI boat that was ahead of its time technologically. The torpedo tubes were designed to operate like a revolver shooting bullets! Blair tends to down play the achievements of the Kreigsmarine in the early years of the war, and the technological advancements put forth by Doenitz and his staff. A fact Mr. Blair conviently omits."
4,Well worth the effort to read,"Blair's first volume in this work is truly an exhaustive study. It's similar to Dumas Malone's ""Jefferson & his times"" in that it takes serious concentration to read. It's worth the effort, very much recommended, and I look forward to reading the second volume."
5,The Definitive History of the U-Boat War,"A detailed history of the U-boat war in the Atlantic from 1939-1942. Virtually every U-boat patrol in that period is covered. Blair's theory is unique: that the U-boats were much less effective than conventional wisdom portrays and that the Germans never came close to cutting the Allied sea lines of communications. In Blair's in-depth assessment, even the vaunted U-boats and their commanders seem weaker, more vulnerable. The book does get a bit slow toward the end, perhaps a bit buried in detail. Blair does a superb job integrating the role of intelligence into this story. He has a wealth of new details about ENIGMA and other intelligence operations. This is the definitive history of this campaign."
3,thumbnail descriptions,Blair's 2 volume history is exhaustive and studded with many fascinating tales. It lacks consideration of the immediate consequences of U Boat attacks in terms of casualties. However it is a great read and incorporates strategy and human toil neatly in a broad treatise. 7 on a 10.
3,Blair packs in the details but minimizes the human side.,"Blair does a significant job detailing the almost daily events of the U-boat war. He lets the reader understand the effects of technology, code-breaking, politics and other historical events on the U-boat struggle. This in turn allows the reader judge the impact that German submarines had on the war. The basic thesis of the book is that even at their height, German U-boats only sunk 5 percent of allied shipping. However, the allies expended a significant amount of men and materials to stop the U-boats. The only point lacking in the book is the human experience. Blair does not go into alot of anecdotal accounts of U-boat service. Generally the book is a decent read."
5,I Love This Series!,"The Year's Best Fantasy and Horror is always exactly that.I pick up this anthology every year because everything Datlow and Windling edit i am guaranteed to like. I am a devotee of both genres,so sometimes I have come across the stories elsewhere(like in their fairy-tales-rewritten-for adults series)but they are always ones i would enjoy rereading.I'm never able to put these down until i'm completely finished,and then im sorry there wasn't more.Highlights of this issue include ""At Eventide"" by Kathe Koja,and ""Granny Weather"" by Charles De Lint."
3,Most disappointing volume in years,"No one will ever like every story in a multi-author collection, but I found that I disliked a majority of this year's Fantasy and Horror collection. Even the list of Honorable Mentions did not seem impressive. Still, the good stories were good, and in themselves are worth reading. However, I suggest borrowing it from your library rather than buying it."
5,Awesomely awe inspiring!,"The Mighty Atom is an awesome yogi and an incredible inspiration for the human spirit. Anyone who needs a boost in life should read this book. You might not be able to accomplish what he did but it shows you that if you put your mind to it you CAN overcome a great deal in your life that you may have falsely believed to be a given. Read it! Thanks, Joe!"
4,Wonderful Remake,This was a really nice remake of the original. Vanessa Williams as always delivered a memorable performance. Jason Alexander excels Conrad Birdie's manager. Not what I expected.
5,Must have musical,"Best of the two ""Bye Bye Birdie"" movies (1995) and (1963). I am not fond of any Jason Alexander's work, but this one is notable. My family wore the VHS tape out. This DVD is a replacement for the tape."
2,Did not get what I bought,I wanted just the Bye Bye Birdie but I got a DVD with 4 movies in it. Is it possible to still return it and get what I asked for?
3,"GOOD REMAKE, BUT A LITTLE UPSETTING!!","I feel that the actors did a wonderful job and the music was great but it didn't give me a touching feeling as I watched it. The real movie with van dyke, margret, leigh, and lynde has much more feeling. They tried hard and did very well though."
5,Bye Bye Birdie,"I love this movie. I have never seen the first one but this one was fun. I am planing to see the fist one. Jason Alexander and Venessa Willams did a great job togeather. Now i wish they could make a ""Bye Bye Birdie 2""! I would recomend this movie to anyone who loves musicals(like myself) and a romantic story(again myself). Have Fun and i hope this helped!"
5,"Excellent version of ""Bye Bye Birdie""","I feel this is an excellent version of ""Bye Bye Birdie"". The cast does a wonderful job in their roles. This filmed version seems to stay closer to the storyline of the play than the previous filmed version from 1963. They have added some extra songs from the original movie as well as new ones for this version. It is a fun movie!"
1,What a lost opportunity,"For everyone waiting for a ""restored"" Bye, Bye Birdie, this TV version came as a real let-down. Jason Alexander is simply out of his league when taking on the role created and brilliantly performed by Dick Van Dyke. And Chynna Phillips as Kim? What a mistake. The rest of the cast is okay, but all suffer in comparison to the 1963 film (which sadly left out some wonderful songs and pressed Janet Leigh into a singing role for which she was not equipped).I'm afraid that those looking to capture the fun and vitality of this great musical will have to be content with the wonderful, if abridged, original film. This show is so much a part of its time that any revival is difficult, but this one fails on many levels."
4,MUCH better than the 1960s film!,"This 1995 version stays MUCH truer to the original musical than the 1960s version with Dick Van Dyke. The old film cuts out almost all of the songs, drastically changes some plot points, and is just awkward overall.This version, however, flows nicely, keeps almost all of the original songs, and works in a couple of song substitutions that still work well. Vanessa Williams and Jason Alexander make a great Rosie and Albert. Chynna Phillips is odd as Kim McAfee, but I bet they cast her on purpose to attach another 'name' to it.Wish the soundtrack was available somewhere!"
2,Bye Bye Bad Movie,"Ugh! I know I shouldn't compare this to the 1963 movie, but [this] ""Bye Bye Birdie"" is inferior to the 1963 ""Bye Bye Birdie"" of the same name. The older movie has more spunk, character and better singing (Van Dyke, Margret, Rydell and yes, Paul Lynde & Pearson). The actors projected more fun on the screen in the older movie than this one. Arrrgh - Chynna Phillips singing."
1,Bad,"Ever hear the expression ""Stick With The Original""? Well, the 1995 remake of ""Bye Bye Birdie"" is no exception.The 1963 original touched my heart and made me feel good; when I first saw it I cried at the end. This 1995 version is just plain stupid. It didn't make me happy and/or feel special as the 1963 version did.If you love the original, do yourself a favor and DON'T see this. It's REALLY bad. The only reason why it didn't get no stars is because the scene with Rosie at the club is funny."
1,Puke!,"Get a life! This is the worst version of Bye Bye Birdie ever! I almost threw up when I first watched it. The story line is stupid, the actors can't act for beans, and the ""fun & new"" songs that are added are just terrible!And may I add that that Wilson Phillips hussy can NEVER out-do Ann-Margret! Oh, and in case no one noticed, the actors look embarrassed half the time.This is NO family movie! It's full of bad jokes and scenes.I'll NEVER understand how ANYONE could even remotely LIKE this movie, let alone love it! It's horrible!"
4,An excellent introduction,"A History of Modern Hungary is an excellent primer of 20th century Hungarian history. Primarily discussing the political events from the Anschluss to the post-Communist era, readers get a good overview of the major events and players who shaped the country's history. The only criticism I have is its relative lack of attention to the social and economic changes Hungary has made over the last 130 years."
4,Interesting reading,"Very interesting information can be found in this book about differences in how the sexes approach relationships.The writing style is a little different, conversational; definitely not your traditional textbook."
4,Frontline Plus,My dog was covered in fleas during the summer. I bathed him and have been using Frontline Plus monthly. I haven't seen a flea on him in the last 5 months. I think the product is good at stopping the fleas from reproducing. I'm not sure how effective it is on killing existing fleas since I had bathed my dog first.
5,Product exactly as described,"It took quite some time to get it, but it did show up before the time had expired. It was exactly as described and a great price for this product. Thanks!"
5,EXCELLENT,"Excellent product, easy to apply, virtually odorless & clear - would not use anything else. Have used for years. Worth the price for the peace of mind for my indoor / outdoor animals."
2,lab lover florida,"i dont know if i got if i got a bad batch or ifs just a poor product,but so far ( 3 weeks into treatment) the ticks are still on my labs. maybewhen i give them there second does in a week,they:ll improve, but so far i cant recommend frontline plus."
3,conflicted,"The product I got was the merial frontline but it came from Australia and it took forever to arrive. It appears to be the same product but I am not entirely 100% sure since different countries have different regulations. the packaging is definitely different. I probably wouldn't order again because I am most comfortable using what I am accustomed to using. The price was competitive but definitely a tradeoff. If you order from this vendor, just know it will take probably 3 weeks to arrive."
5,Worked just as it promised,"I got this for my little chihuahua mix cause I had found a tick and flea on her. It came perfectly in the package, unused, or unopened. It got rid of the ticks and fleas. I will purchase this again! Plus at the price you can't beat it!"
3,Not Sure yet,"We have two dogs and two cats. The cats have been on Revolution their entire life (12+ years) and they have never had a problem with fleas or ticks. The two dogs are on Frontline (they cannot take Revolution because they are both heart worm positive), it seems to work on one dog but not the other. Both dogs are rescued pit-bulls (at least mostly pit bull)one is all brown, and the other is mostly white with a single black eye, and splotched ears. It seems to work fine on the brown dog, but is not very effective on the white dog. I don't why, and the vet is bit perplexed about it too."
3,Not sure,"The package came on time.The price of the product was very good. However the product inside was marked ""US Vet Use Only"". I have never seen that on a Frontline product before. Maybe this is something new and hopefully this is not a bogus knock-off. We won't know for sure...."
4,Frontline performance,"The product appears to packaged for a different country, but I assume it contains the same active ingredients that I am used to with the product that is available locally. So far it has kept the ticks and fleas off the hound and out of the house."
5,Frontline,Thanks for the service! We've got two small dogs and this will work great. We will be repeat customers. Thanks again!
4,works so far,"This product seems to work. The spot got a little oily and it was hard to get it right on the skin, but the oily spot went away after a few days."
5,Best to buy on Amazon,I just wanted to say you might find this product some where else a little cheaper but when you add all there shipping charges ect. it's still cheaper on Amazon. I have always used frontline for all my animals cats and dogs. I tried advantage and I hated it. I thought I was going cheaper but it was a waste of my money. I have tried all the other prands they sell at walmart ect. they do not work. I was told bymyvet towas my animals with dawn dish soap then when they dry put the frontline on and you do not need to use dawn again. It works!!!!! Good luck!
5,Company review,"I ordered a product from this company and in the confusion of the Christmas rush and world events at the time my order never arrived. I contacted the company about this and they were very helpful in resolving my issue and promptly refunded my money. I would order from thme again.Sincery,Gary"
5,As promised,"I saw that some reviewers said they did not receive what was pictured, but I did not experience that. As for the product, I have been using this on my greyhound for the past year and he hasn't had fleas, so I guess it must be working..."
2,What is pictured is not what is sent,"Although you technically get what is described, it does not come in a box with 6 vials, it comes in a bag with 4 vials that you have to measure out in a jar with a dropper that is provided. That is not what you get sent when you buy what is pictured. Not impressed!"
5,This Product Works,"The best thing I can say about any product is that is preforms to the level of the manufacturers marketing. Frontline may be expensive, but it works... In the long run that is a money, time saver! I highly recommend."
3,Fleas,"Unfortunately the fleas were rampid this year as it didn't get cold enough to kill them off this past winter. I used to like Frontline, but I think the fleas are becoming imune as most insects do after time. My vet also said that I can apply this every three weeks, as the third week is it's weakend state and it is not effective. I don't like putting any poisons or chemicals on my pets, but my dog is allergic to the bites. And they are brought in to my indoor cats (2). I've tried others, but I find the only real solution is a good flea comb every couple of days (and with the bowl of soapy water to dump the fleas in). Vigilance is the basic cure. I also use an organic shampoo called ""defender"" which is very good. But all in all, Frontline is probably the best choice out of all of them out there."
3,Cheaper at Sams,"The best product you can buy. The price is always a concern and it is cheaper at Sams Club, so you should buy it there."
1,frontline doesn't work anymore,My vet tells me they have changed the formula and it is no longer effective. My poor dogs are living proof.
1,"Save your money and your pet's discomfort, buy other product",No longer works against fleas. Vet and local pet store both said that everyone is complaining about this product no longer working on fleas. Had to return and buy another product as dog has severe flea allergy. Nightly flea combing did more for getting rid of fleas.
3,Flea Frontline,We just got our dog in July and this is what we started to give her. We noticed that when she didn't have it she didn't get as many flees but when we gave it to her she got more. I think we are going to try something edible that goes into her system and see how that works.
1,Buy it from the vet,"I have used frontline for years, but always bought it from the vet...now I see why I should always buy it from the vet...this 6 pack was not effective."
5,Great Price,"This product not only works, but the price can't be beat. So glad the vet is not the only one who can offer it."
2,Mediocre,"I have been using frontline for years, but lately doesn't seem to be working for my dogs. After applying, there are still signs of fleas and constant itching."
2,Not too effective,"In the Summertime, I spend, a lot of money on flea killers. I keep trying, but just can't seem to get any results. Maybe I should just try to drive little tiny stakes through their hearts. I can't get anything else to work! I hate to say it, but I've tried about everything on my two small dogs. I've hired Terminix to spray my front and back yards, I use Capstar 24 hour pills as a supplement, I've tried not only Frontline, but two or three others of the same type. None of them work. I live in Alabama, and we do have some tough tropical weather down here, in the Summer, but I just can't seem to have any luck with Frontline."
3,Dog still has ticks,"Though the product seems to be working with regards to fleas, my dog still gets ticks. It's very disappointing. The reason I switched from advantage to Frontline was specifically because Advantage did not take care of ticks. I think I'm going to try Advantix."
1,It doesn't work on my dogs...,"I hate to say it, but I've tried about everything on my two small dogs. I've hired Terminix to spray my front and back yards, I use Capstar 24 hour pills as a supplement, I've tried not only Frontline, but two or three others of the same type. None of them work. I live in Southeast Texas, and we do have some fierce tropical weather down here, in the Summer, but I just can't seem to have any luck with Frontline. In the Summertime, I spend, on average, around $300 per month on flea killers. I keep trying, but just can't seem to get any results. Maybe I should just try to drive little tiny stakes through their hearts. I can't get anything else to work!"
2,Last 3 vials were half empty,I guess none of these products work all that great. I still found a tick on my dog last month and I get my yard treated every quarter. I just tried to put the next treatment on him and the last 3 vials are half empty. I've tried other products from the pet store but they have ingredients that my dog is allergic to and the product from my Vet is very expensive. I might buy this product again but from a local store so I can return it easily if I get half empty containers.
2,slow shipping seller!,This seller took a VERY long time to ship the product. I will never buy anything from them again!!!!!
1,Did not work,"I have bought Frontline in the past (from Petco)and the results are almost instant. I purchased this online because it was a great buy, but my dog still has fleas. I guess you get what you pay for. Not Pleased!!!!!!!"
1,Completely disappointed...,I purchased Frontline and applied it on our new English Bulldog puppy in June. At first I thought it was working because I did not see any fleas but the second week after applying it he was infested with fleas! I gave him medicine to kill the adult fleas on him and washed him with medicated shampoo. We had to fumigate the entire house which was extremely annoying! I tried it one more time and two days later I found a few fleas on him again this time we caught it in enough time that he wasn't completely infested. I am disappointed in this product and find it completely ineffective and a waste of money. If it did anything it attracted more fleas. We are currently still looking for flea medicine but nothing seems to be working.
1,Not satisfied with frontline plus,"I have always used frontline plus on my many dogs but this year, my pom got sick when I used it on her, she couldnt get enough to drink and was panting alot I mean alot she layed around and didnt want to go out with me to walk or even in the yard, and the front of her chest area was ringing wet from her panting not from the water not satisfied with this product anymore and I've heard of more people complaining that frontline is not the same as it used to be,, I am not using it on my pom because I don't want her sickagain.."
5,My dog and cat are free,I have been using Frontline Plus for my dogs and cats for 16 years. The product has already proven to me that it does what it says it will do. We are now living in TICK country and the product has not failed us yet.The shipping was quick and the product arrived before it said it would. We are happy campers!
5,Great service and price.,I received this item very quickly and at a great price. I will order from them again.
5,Purchase of Frontline,Fast shipment of the product and very cost effective! Would highly recommend if Frontline is your choice for flea control.
1,Be careful,Only one time in 10 yeaars have I applied Frontline Plus on my cat when it didn't get rid of his fleas at all. I was mystified -- I couldn't understand why it wasn't working. Then I remembered that it was the first time I ever bought a pack online instead of from my vet. The prices are tempting but...
1,This product is AWFUL!,"We have used Frontline on our 3 dogs for a long time & we have always trusted it, but has stopped working all together. Our dogs & home became infested with fleas. It was like we had not put any flea/tick meds on them. Our dogs have never dealt with fleas like this. It broke my heart because our dogs are like our children. I hated seeing them suffer. After some research & advice from quite a few friends who also had a rough time with Frontline, we switched to K9 Advantix II & within 24 hours did not see a flea. We also ended up having to bomb our home twice. Don't use this product. It's a waste of money & a headache to deal with."
1,Be Warned! Don't order from this seller,"This seller (Liteaid) is simply taking dosages for much larger dogs and then sending just the dosage, no original packaging, along with a syringe, an empty bottle and photo copied directions to measure out the correct dosage for your size dog. This is obviously not as described, I also received enough for 3 dosages for my size dog (35 lbs), not 6 as the item describes, which is really beside the point because I am absolutely NOT comfortable with this. I am lodging a complaint with Amazon so they'll stop using this seller and trying to get my money back, although, I doubt that'll happen. I re-ordered the product sold by Amazon, NOT Liteaid (I did that by mistake in the first place!)"
1,THIS PRODUCT IS FOREIGN LABEL AND ILLEGAL TO SELL IN THE US,"I received this product and there were a few things that were not cosistent with other Frontline Plus I had bought in the past. 1. It is in KG (yes I know the description says this). 2. It has an expiration date on it. 3. There is no EPA number. I contacted Merial the manufacturer with my suspicions and was told that that for their products that ar legal to be sold in the U.S. they will be in pounds with no expiration date on them and with an EPA number. I am sending my two boxes back to Merial and they are going to send me legit product. Acording to Merial the only way to ensure you are getiing real product is to buy from a Vet, they do not distribute to anyone else. Counterfeit products can harm your pet."
3,"Worked before, but for some reason, not effective anymore","I've used Frontline Plus on my dog for years and its been great at quickly killing fleas and prevention. However, this pack has done very little. A week after application, my dog still had some fleas on him and they haven't gone away. Even after a second application, the fleas are still there. Going to have to try a different brand of medication for now to get effective results."
5,"Great Product, Fast delivery",Never found a flea on Kodie since I have been using this product.Seller shipped item quickly.
2,Doesn't work for my large or small dog,"I purchased it at my vet's office. My large 90 pound Golden had flees a little over 2 weeks later and the fleas on my Scotty never went away. Since I live in the south the fleas and tick problem are insane. Both my dogs are inside dogs unless they go out for an hour to play and potty. My Scotty had a tick on her and my Golden began getting hot spots all over from the fleas. Fed up I went back to the vet office and this time purchased Revolution which apparently covers fleas, ticks AND prevents heartworm all for the same price. Frontline doesn't cover against heartworm. My vet mentioned that Frontline is losing its effectiveness. Def. will not buy again."
2,Misleading Ad,The description does not mention this is only a 3-pack for the price of a 6-pack. I WILL NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN. DELIBERATLEY MISLEADING!
5,Frontline works like it should,"I have five dogs at my house most days. Mine, My neighbors, My friends two dogs & her Mothers dog. I use Frontline plus on all of them with no skin problems. It is very easy to apply and We have not found one single tick on any of these dogs. Getting the product from Amazon is fast & easy and I save a whole lot of money."
2,Big disappointment!,I was so disappointed in this product. So many people recommended this product to me so I got it for my dog. It did not get rid of the fleas at all. I can't say whether it works on ticks or not because we are fortunate not to have many here. My dog only goes outside to use the bathroom and she's got fleas. Will not be purchasing this again in the future.
3,not as pictured. dosage was for weight in kgs although correct quantity wassupplied.,Good product and works really good for our dog. Amazon provides the cheapest pricefor this product. Will most likely buy here again at amazon.
4,Great,This product was exactly as I ordered it. My mom needed it for her small dog and the price was better than from the vet. Great product. Thank you
2,"Great price point, but...","...I don't know if we got good stuff. We haven't had a problem buying Frontline here in the past, but for some reason, this shipment didn't seem to keep the fleas away. Very disappointing, because even though it was cheaper here, it's still a significant purchase!"
1,Frontline just doesn't work,I used Fronline for the last 4 years with no problem but this year it just isn't working at all. I even researched to see if it was possibly a counterfeit. It just isn't working this year.
1,Doesnt Work Anymore,When we first started using it seemed to work well. Now it seems like the fleas are getting drunk off the frontline and flourishing.
5,good product,I have been using this for years. Works good but sometimes takes a couple months of treatment to kick in. Especially if you are having a bad flea infestation.
5,Best Prices for a great product,"I have been using Frontline Plus for my dog and he has never had a tick or flea. He is a Tibetan Terrier.He did get Lyme disease the first year I had him but I believe it was because I did not use the Frontline from Nov - January. We went to a wildlife preserve in March and I believe he may have contracted the disease. Or he may have gotten it when he was off the Frontline. So I have never stopped using it during the winter months.At his next vet appt he had the C6 test that can distinguish between infection and Lyme antibody and his score was very low, meaning that he was only carrying the antibody and not the disease. I have given him Frontline continuously since then.So I am a fan of Frontline and found Amazon to have the best prices even beating discount pet websites."
5,Frontline Plus,Good product. I have 2 large dogs and it is easy to apply and seems to work very well.
4,It's a lot cheaper than elsewhere,"It's cheaper than Costco, my vet, and other places online. For the exact same product (I hope), only differentiation is price."
1,Frontline Plus,"After using Frontline Plus that I bought from my Vet. my Tuffy (Pom) is now a Diabetic, he has to have 2 shots aday for the rest of his life. The Vet. Bills are extreme and I did not know about using Dawn Blue to wash it off of him until I got on the Forum Site here. I also did not do any research until the damage was done. I trusted this high dollar product and only wanted to give him the best, first time I used it and this will be the last. So many animals have died or sick from this, not counting all the heartbreak we have been through."
4,Great product at a great price on amazon.com!,"Simply put, this product does what it says it does and has not had any adverse affects on our dog since we've been using it on him for approximately 10 years now. I'm not thrilled with the chemicals it uses to get the job done, but as long as our dog is fine why mess with a good thing."
1,No longer works,"Did you change the recipe Frontline? Is this a conspiracy on your front, or are the fleas conspiring against me? Anyway, my animals all continued to itch like crazy and I continued to find fleas on them after multiple applications (several months). So this is a product that doesn't do the one job it's sold to do."
1,save your money,"apparently this products works great- IF and I repeat IF- your dog doesn't have fleas. Some how my dog got some, so after doing everything in my powers, washing, vacuuming and the like, this item is allowing them to stay on his body. Just another product big on promise short on delivery. I will not waste another dime with this company."
5,Frontline Plus,We live in the country with open fields and trees. Been using Frontline Plus for years and so far no fleas or ticks. The last order we made through Amazon because of the price and quick service from ordering to receiving... works well.
1,IS IT THE REAL THING?,"I purchased this product for my animals, as well, and it was no better than having put baby oil on them. I noted that the price is VERY CHEAP and so I eagerly bought it. After the first three months applications, and my animals were still scratching viciously, as well as I began to have a flea infestation in my carpets, I smelled the contents of one of the vials. It smelled very vaguely of a perfumed scent. The Frontline from my vet smells strongly like that of a pesticide. Thus, having said that, I feel like this is a BOGUS PRODUCT. I would not recommend purchasing this product. IT DOES NOT WORK!"
5,Annie,Our dogs seem to do very well on this product. We give them a dose and then in two weeks another at the start of warmer weather. Then just once a month and that really seems to work for us.
2,Still has Fleas,"My dog still had fleas after the first dose, no ticks, but fleas are her main problem. The smell is better than the other products I've tried."
5,Worked very well if sticking to the schedule,My dogs have been using this product for years and it works very well on them. The occasions that the dogs attracted fleas and/or ticks were often due to my fault of not sticking to the schedule. Monthly application is the key because we live in a subtropical environment. Skipping two months a few times caused tons of headaches on us dealing with flea or tick infestations. So far my dogs haven't had any negative reactions to it.
4,My dogs loved this!,"I only gave it 4 stars because it only lasts 3 weeks to a month, while I expected to get at-least a month and a half. Its far too expensive for me to continue purchasing this because I have two dogs. Guess they'll have to stick to their flea collars and flea baths (which works just as fine)"
2,ugghhh,shipped fast was very happy with that but it just didnt seem to work well on the fleas this year I think all the fleas are building up an immunity to all this stuff !
4,webDogTrainer.com review,As a dog trainer and for my own dog I like this product. I like to go hiking with my large dog and this is great for tick season!-Julie the online dog trainer from www.webDogTrainer.com
4,frontline solid choice,"HelloWe've had the dog for two years and this product has always worked for us.I do wonder about its safety ( the box says you can't touch the dog for 4 hours after application. What magically happens after four hours to make it ok?)Anyway, so far it's working better than anything else.Maria"
4,Do not buy from....,I have been using Frontline Plus for my two Yorkies for a year and it has worked well unit I purchased it from Pet Plaza. I've noticed my dogs have been scratching a lot. I finally decided to buy it from a different merchant and almost immediately the scratching stopped. I will never buy from Pet Plaza again.
4,frontline,"Glad I ordered it. Big savings, product works well. My recommendations to anyone who is thinking about purchasing it."
4,Frontline Plus,"I received a 6 month supply for what I paid for a 3 month supply at the vet. Very pleased with the savings; in addition, to the seller made contact with me asap & kept me posted on the order & when it would be shipped."
5,great product,I have 7 yes Seven dogs and Frontline has kept them flea and tick free for over 5 years!
5,It works!,We have two pugs......and no fleas or ticks. Have been using this product for years and wouldn't bother trying something else. Our yard is a heavily wooded area which the dogs are in every day and we've never had a flea problem. Application is very easy.
5,Best Flea and Tick Product available,"I have been using Frontline for years, but had recently decided to switch to the less expensive Biospot and was not at all satisfied with the product. Other products that are available in grocery stores made my dogs itch and scratch hard enough for them to pull their hair out.It's Frontline for my animals from now on."
4,Pets - Frontline Plus,The product arrived quickly and in good condition. It was muchmore convenient to order on-line than to drive all the way tothe vet's office to pick it up. Thanks.
1,Still have the Fleas.,"I purchased this product on Amazon because I was told by everyone how great Frontline worked. Ha Ha! I put it on my dog to rid her of the few fleas she had. Well let me tell you, it did nothing. Someone from my local pet rescue told me it works for about 4 days. I even bought the plus which is supposed to work well beyond 30 days. Maybe it's a new formula, or maybe the fleas have found an immunity, but I can tell you the product did nothing for my dog and her itching. I recommend you purchase a different product."
5,Great Product!,This product is the only fela and tick control that I use for my puppy. You will never see fleas again.
2,dont work for 30 days more like 15 days,this worked for about 15 days i am not sure i will buy any more i think it would be better to just get rid of my dog insted
4,Excelente!!!,Todas las pulgas desaparecieron por completo al cabo de una semana. El producto seria perfecto si el efecto fuese más rápido.
3,vet cautions against,My Vet said that if the package does not say that it's from France i could be taking a risk with this product--that it would not be what it is suppposed to be. does anyone else have info about this? It is half the price online with amazon as it is at the vet's. heicro
2,"If your dog is pregnant do NOT use this product, the puppies died in both my female dogs I used it on.","I had three pregnant Chihuahua females, I did NOT treat one of the females because shes is blue and more sensitive then the other two. The package states it is safe to use on pregnant females however, one week after use the two females that had been lactating, had milk and 'bagging out' dried totally up with all signs of being pregnant vanishing immediately after use of this product. I notified them, they asked me what happened, I told them, they refused to accept responsibility as the woman told me 'their' tests did not indicte this problem. If you love your dogs, your puppies, your smaller animals, do not trust this product or these people. The doctors also thought it was safe to use the anti nausea medicine in women 40 years ago that caused birth defects by the thousands! This company LIES! It is VERY dangerous to the life of your pet."
2,Doesn't last or doesn't work,"I have a 2 year old whippet, about 25 pounds and I've tried using Frontline instead of a competitors product that would require a prescription. Anyway, I normally bathe the dog before application (to get most of the fleas off) and at best Frontline will work on fleas for 2 weeks. Though Frontline boasts being waterproof, it seems the dosage weakens if I bathe the dog again at some point after application of the medicine (days later).Suffice it to say, spending money on doses that are advertised supposed to last a month at a time and hardly cover a couple of weeks does not seem worth it."
1,WORST PERFORMING ON THE MARKET.,"Someone please try to tell me that you never get one or two ticks a year regardless of using this product as instructed. I've been using it for years on my dogs. Then one of them got a tick disease despite using Frontline religously. I want only the best for my dogs, that's why I went with the most expensive, thinking it was the best. I was always taking off fully gorged ticks from my dogs. I decided to try other brands. I've ended up using a brand called Freedom, sold at Tractor Supply. Since using it, NOT A SINGLE TICK has gotten through. It's been over a year now and not a one. Plus it's less expensive. Give it a try and you'll be pleasantly surprised.I've told this to my Vet and they've since starting using it as well, even though they still sell Frontline."
2,"Less than a month later, dog is scratching again.","I bought this because my dog had some fleas. Not an infestation but I found a couple on him and he was scratching a lot. The instructions on Frontline say that you need to repeat every 30 days, yet here we are- 3 weeks after application and he's scratching again. Not great!"
1,FAKE??????,"Ok So I have used this product for the past two months and it is not working. I don't know why, it appears to be in the exact same box as the one you would get from your local vet. I know it says it takes at most 18 hours to take affect. Well It has been 10 days since my last application and I just had 3 F****** fleas jump off my little chihuahua and onto me. I am not happy about this at all. I only paid about $20 less than what I would have paid at the vets office. WHAT'S THE DEAL????Is this S*** fake ?????????????????I don't usually do reviews if the product is good. but when it is bad I do because I don't want anyone else wasting their money!!!JUST GO TO YOUR VET TO GET THIS. For some unknown reason this just isn't working and I am frustrated."
1,paid for a 6 pack and received a 3 pack - beware!,Be careful about what you think you are purchasing. Paid for the 6 pack shown and was sent a 3 pack - BEWARE! The packaging looks exactly alike so you are not aware right away if you are not inspecting carefully.
1,TOO EXPENSIVE for such few applications,"I have used both avantix and advantage. I can not understand the rationale to make this products extremely expensive, 4 applications for over $35 dls?. Do they make generic brands? I'd like to know."
2,Does not work!,"I put the frontline on my 6 years old 10 pd maltese, and 2 weeks later I saw fleas!!! and I thought maybe because I gave him a bath the day after i put the flea control on. So I put another one on him and I made sure I didn't give him a bath until the 3rd day. and 2 weeks later, i saw TWO fleas!!! this stuff suppose to work up to 6 weeks!!!"
1,Caused Seizures in My dogs,"My dogs have been having seizures on an almost regular monthly basis since they were 4 months old (they are littermates). I only started recently searching about the relationship between Frontline and seizures, and there are SO MANY people whose pets have had seizures from Frontline--just do a tiny bit of research. Your vet will deny it but there are too many people who have reported it. Sure enough, I realized my dogs were having seizures 1-2 days after each application of Frontline, like clockwork. (and all other causes have been eliminated--they have a healthy diet, etc etc)This product may work well on some dogs, but for mine, the evidence is clear and the Frontline has been causing seizures in my dogs. Many people have reported that their dog stopped having immediately after stopping using Frontline.I'm switching to a gentler, natural brand."
5,Frontline plus review,"Good product, necessary for pet protection. Price online at Amazon is only about $5.00 cheaper than in the pet stores, but it adds up over time, better than nothing!"
5,Frontline,Ordered Saturday - received Monday - no shipping - delivered to my door - item as described - what more could you ask for - GREAT SERVICE
2,No Good,I have used this for years and it has never worked. Also it has not worked for my vet. He has two dogs and it will last a little over two weeks. It last from one to two weeks for me allso. She is a inside dog. When I started to use this and it did not last I called Frontline and I was told to use a larger size.
2,Don't buy online,"I bought this frontline thinking i was getting a good deal plus it was a amazon verified purchase. Got my product and did the application to both my dogs. I did get the green vials, however, the fleas are still here. Went to Merials website and found that they only sell to vets. Never buying this stuff from here again. A few bucks more from a vet insures safety."
1,terrible! dont waste your money!,"this stuff did not work!do not buy this, its weak and not water proof.my house was covered and my dogs were loaded!!it only worked for 10 days."
3,Sorta works...,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall. It worked well, and killed off a few fleas she had picked up. All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine, not a single flea. However, come late spring, the stuff totally failed. Not only was she covered in fleas, but so were our cats and furniture! After finally getting rid of the fleas, we switched to K9 Advantix. That seems to be keeping up with the challenge. I guess it works better for light duty, but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season, which is sort of the whole point. I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though, maybe that's just what happened."
5,Frontline Topspot is Tops,"While Frontline Topspot should be one part of a complete flea control program that should include house spray and yard & kennel spray, I have found this product to be so effective that it works Quite effectively as a stand alone product.It is also much safer than most flea control products. My dog is deathly allergic to the main ingrediant used in 95% of flea control products on the market, but that doesn't matter, because Frontline blows them all away."
1,disappointed,I was very unhappy with my results with this product. I have used it several times in the past with both of my dogs. This time was very disappointing and both dogs continued to have problems with fleas. I used one applicator each per dog repeating the following month. Continued with problems even after second application. I will not be purchasing this product again. Next time I will be taking them both to the vet and see what options I have available to me.
2,Dog treatment,Fast shipping! But I feel like the Treatment is just not as effective as it should be. Fleas come back after a week.
1,Does not work,I got this from a store and put it on my dog. It was not doing anything for her for fleas. I called the vet and they said a lot of people are having problems with Frontline not working and suggested I switched her over to Advantage.
1,Didn't work,I ordered this product because my dog was showing allergies to the generic brand flea treatment. I applied this the way the directions said to and two days later I found fleas on my dog. He didn't have an allergic reation to this medication but it didn't work to protect him from fleas. I purchased a different name brand and it has worked much better!!
1,Terrible,We put the flea medicine on as it says but the fleas only left for a few days.It has only been around 2 weeks and my dog is still covered with fleas.I would definitely not recommend this to anyone. I don't know if it has to do with my dog being an American Eskimo Spitz?
1,Something was wrong with this product. Expired or counterfeit.,"My dog is 8 years old and never had a flea with Frontline plus. I buy enough to last for months. Then suddenly my dog gets fleas. Frontline plus is not cheap. Of course, enough time had passed I didn't remember exactly where I bought it. I use gift cards to buy my pet products. He don't work and lives on freebies. I wore out a vacuum. And tried many products. Finally I found a replacement. This took a tole on me and my pet. I will never forget that someone harmed my pet and took my money. Not to mention the hours of extra work on my part to keep my pet clean and comfy. Please be careful to examine your products when they arrive. You will so regret buying a fake or expired product. You should enjoy the spring and summer months with your pet."
1,Be careful!,"I've used Frontline on my dogs for years with no problem and I still think it's a fine product. This one star review is based on my most recent experience. I ordered this product through Amazon and received an illegal product via a third party seller. I got Frontline Combo, which is not approved by the EPA for sale in the US, in a Frontline Plus box. The lot numbers on the box and product did not match either, so clearly someone had deliberately tampered with the product. I experienced the illegal sale of a pesticide, product tampering, and mail fraud all in one transaction. A representative at Merial, the manufacturer, told me that this problem is widespread on the Internet and advised me to buy Frontline products only from my vet. I just took a look at the seller reviews and there are a number of us who have had the same experience with this seller, so I don't think Amazon is paying attention. Please be careful about what you are putting on your beloved pets!"
4,Frontline,The product is very effective on fleas when used once a month. It is less effective on ticks after three weeks so you should check your dog carefully if ticks are active in your area. We have used product fo over 6 years with our 70 lb lab and will continue to use it.
1,Aweful,This product does not work as advertised. After giving my dog two applications she still has fleas. I contacted a vet who told me that he pulled this product from his store because fleas have grown immune to it so it is no longer effective.
5,Excellent Product,"We have been using frontline Plus for years. Occasionally we find a tick on our girls and most of the time they are dead, or if not are easy to remove without leaving the head under the skin. We have never seen a flea. There have been no adverse reactions to the medication and they have never contracted Lyme disease. All in all a great med though a little expensive. But key family members are way more than worth the expenditure."
2,Fleas have developed a tolerance,It appears that the fleas have developed a tolerance for this product in our area. After a week or two I have spotted fleas and my puppy is still itching and pulling out his hair. It did appear to work for ticks which is why I opted for this brand over an oral flea control but I may have to alternate since the fleas don't seem to be affected. :(
5,Frontline,This was the very product I needed. The price was fair and the delivery time was excellent.
5,Frontline Plus for dogs,"Frontline is a great product. I have been using it successfully for many years. This past order, tho, is the first time I had to pay for shipping even though the cost was over $25 for each product. Hopefully when I order again, the free shipping will be in place."
1,PRODUCT IS NOT WHAT IS ON THE BOX,"THIS PRODUCT SAYS 'FRONTLINE PLUS' ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOX, ON THE INSIDE OF THE BOX IS FRONTLINE COMBO. THEY ARE 2 DIFFERENT FRONTLINES. MY DOG HAS ALLERGIES TO FRONTLINE COMBO, THAT'S HOW I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. THE FIRST TIME I BOUGHT THIS I DIDN'T CATCH IT IN TIME AND MY DOG WENT CRAZY. THEN I RETURNED IT,GOT REFUND AND MOVED ON. I JUST ORDERED THIS PRODUCT AGAIN FROM A TOTALLY DIFFERENT NAMED COMPANY AND REALIZED IT IS THE SAME COMPANY, WITH THE SAME FALSE PRODUCT INSIDE....SO FAR THERE IS 3 DIFFERENT COMPANY NAMES ATTACHED TO THIS COMPANY....ONCE I GET MY REFUND, I WILL NOT BE ORDERING FROM AMAZON AT ALL FOR FRONTLINE PRODUCTS, CAN'T RISK THIS COMPANY ADDING YET ANOTHER COMPANY NAME TO THEIR PRODUCTS..FRAUDULANT COMPANY(S)FRAUDULANT DESCRIPTION....."
5,Easy to apply and works great,"I've been using Frontline Plus on my two Cavaliers for several years and it really works. Not only does it protect them from the misery of flea bites, but it also keeps them away from me. I'm allergic to flea bites and get awful itchy sores that take forever to heal.Easy and quick to apply once a month and there's no side effects on the dogs. We're all happy. Great product. Better than the old flea powders and collars that were messy and didn't work. Good stuff."
1,Really doesn't work!,My wife and I foster rescue dogs and over the past 2 years we have fostered over 160 dogs at our home. Frontline does a fair job on the fleas but has no effect on the ticks. A very poor value for the high price you have to pay.
5,"Wow, incredible results","I tried many things. I had to give a bath to my dog about once a week to keep it away from too many (never without) fleas. Used other brands of drops like this one, sprays and dog collars without any good results. Today, after 2 weeks of apñlyng this produc I have not being able to find a single flea on my dog. She is absolutly happy not having to scratch all the time."
2,Frontline Plus,"It's entirely possible that my dog is a special kind of delicacy for the fleas (no ticks around), but as soon as two days after application (acompanied by medicated bath), Bud had fleas. First application was 15th of Apr, second will be today - 12th May.I'm really disappointed since I DID review the product and ordered it based on reviews. Won't use it again, since Bud still has bugs."
2,Not Satisfied,"After using for a couple of months, I am not satisfied with the product. My dog still is annoyed by fleas. Perhaps I got a bad batch but will try another brand next time."
5,Frontline plus,"Arrived promptly and as expected. I have not yet used it, but I expect that it will repel fleas as well as the Frontline products I have used on my dog in the past."
1,Product leaking,"I purchased the 6 pack for large dogs. When I peeled off the outer foil wrapper, there was liquid leaking from the applicator. Not sure if this was a defective lot. I called Merial and they will be replacing it!"
1,Doesn't work!,"I rarely completely pan a product, but I have to this time. I put Frontline on my little dog just last week, and then last night, he was again flea covered! I've bought Frontline before, and had good success with it, but for some reason, this time it's not working. I will not purchase it again, and I still have 5 tubes of it left! *sigh*"
2,Frontline isnt working,The frontline isnt working for my dogs anymore Im not sure why but I did receive it fast and it was a satisfactory purchase as far as the sellers goes it just didnt work on them so I am trying to figure out another route. I put it on and they still have fleas.Not the sellers fault. Recieve fast and in fine condition.
5,Good Price Easy to Use,I love Frontline for keeping the fleas of my dog. This is the best price that I've found.
5,Great Product,"Seems to work great.I've seen a few fleas, but then they are gone and haven't seen any since."
5,Great Price!,Great Product at a Great Price! Easy transaction and quick shipping make this a no brainer to make another purchase.
1,Stopped working,We successfully used this for years on dogs and cats until this month. It stopped working! Perhaps the fleas developed a resistance? Switched to Advantage II which worked.
4,One Dog to go with my three cats!,One Dog to go with my three cats! This is the product we have been using on the dog for quite some time and it seems to work.
3,Maybe Okay,"Doesn't work any better than what we've always used. (Advantage) But it costs less, so we decided to try it."
4,You should still check your dog for ticks.,"Live in New Hampshire and use this product on my dog religiously once a month. Even so, she still contracted the tick borne illness called anaplasmosis which was life-threatening (generalized bleeding due to low platelets). All the tick needs is 24 hours or so to infect a dog.To be fair, I have used this same product on 3 other dogs over the last 15 years and have never had one test positive for any tick borne disease. So I guess the lesson here is not that this product is ineffective but just that it still pays to physically check your dog for ticks whenever he/she has been outside because no product is 100% effective at preventing tick borne diseases."
5,Good price,"Good product, really makes a difference in keeping my dog healthy. Our vet recommends it. Sew were glad to see it offered online"
1,Damn hurry up!!!,"What's it on a slow boat from china, it has been36 days and still have not received my item."
4,"Florida ""winter"" has been too kind to the fleas","... but monthly doses of this are keeping the fleas in check, for the most part. The dogs don't care for it too much, but it keeps them reasonably flea-free. I don't know if they don't like the smell, or don't like the feel, but they seem put-out when I dose them. I'm happy, though, and isn't that what matters?"
2,why!,"i expect fleas to be gone and dead, and het the next day, they are still on my dog who has a got spot.. failed.."
4,"Expensive, but Works",Works well but could be easier to apply. The pricing tempts me to buy the largest size and split it on my dogs.
5,very pleased with price & shipping time,"i was ecstatic with the price, I shopped everywhere to find the best price for this quality product and I found it here. It was shipped out & arrived at my door super fast & with minimal packaging so there was no excess waste. I couldnt ask for a better experience. Valarie"
1,Frontline,Mail order Frontline does not stop ticks on my 85# lab. We take 15-20 ticksoff him every day. I suspect the mail order Frontline is some foreign counterfeit. I am going back to a flea and tick collar.
1,Hard to say,"I switched from Advantix II to this b/c the ticks around here are bad in the summer but in the end, none of them worked. What I have been using and it has worked since is Pet Naturals spray which is a mix of natural products and you simply spray the dog before a walk and it prevents the ticks from attaching to the dog in the first place and that has worked and I have been using it for years. The plus side is it is all Natural and not a chemical like Frontline or K9 Advantix which is a big plus. Also a little drop of apple cider or vinegar on their treat is another natural repellant and great for their immune system. During peak seasons of ticks when it is warm ill drop some on their treats once every week and even that little amount helps."
1,COUNTERFEIT COUNTERFEIT COUNTERFEIT,This product is FAKE from this seller. Packaging looks legit BUT IT DOES NOT WORK. My pets came in from outside this at least one tick daily. I finally became fed up and went to my vets office to buy the real thing and I haven't found a tick on them since.
1,did not kill fleas at all,This product was either defective or outdated...it did not work AT ALL. I applied the liquid directly on the fleas and they were still alive after 30-60 seconds...it did not kill them!
2,Waiting to find out if I'm duped,"I am so confused about what this product is. I just thought I was ordering FRONTLINE? Why do they state ""Merial"" before Frontline?I will know as soon as it arrives, but reading many of the reviews I feel something is rotten in Denmark."
4,frontline review,"The product works, but it is over priced. This vendor does have it at one of the better prices, but the product itself is over priced for a 3 month supply. I am happy with its performance."
1,Waiting.,"I waited so long for this to be delivered,I almost bought some elsewhere.I was very surprised as anything I order through Amazon is always delivered fast.I will not buy from this company again but do not blame Amazon for the delay."
5,good flea & tick product,Product is good against fleas & ticks. I never find any fleas on my dogs or in the house. THe only ticks I find are dead ones. I've used this product for years.
1,Doesn't Kill Ticks,"To begin with, I purchased this product from my vet, not from here.I am always taking walks in the woods with my dogs. This year was a really bad tick year in my area, and my dogs were getting inundated with ticks. I'd pull out whatever ticks I found and then figure, ""Oh well, Frontline will take care of the ones I couldn't find"".I was wrong: even now, two weeks after our last walk in the woods, I am still finding very much alive, engorged ticks on my dogs. Bear in mind: I apply it every month, and one of the ticks that I found today was just in the spot where Frontline is applied!You know what saved my dogs? The Lyme disease shot they received before all this happened!Frontline may or may not work with fleas, that I don't know, but it certainly does not work with ticks. Anyone who lives in a tick-ridden area, don't rely on this product: get your dogs a Lyme disease shot instead."
1,didn't work at all :(,"used this stuff because my dogs have fleas. it says the fleas should be dead by 24 hours, but 3 days later i didn't notice any differance so i emailed them. they just sent me a message explaining how it's supposed to work. hahahaa, thanks for telling me how it's SUPPOSED to work while i'm watching my dogs scratch. the fleas keep getting worse, so i've been giving them flea baths every week to relieve the itching. i'm ordering advantage now and hopefully the little guys will feel better soon :("
5,Best purchase I ever made,Tis was one of the best purchases I ever made. I saved 75% over retail. Flea and tick protection is expensive if you buy a product that will work and frontline is the best. I bought this cheaper than the junk stuff that will not evan work. I am very happy and have told many other dog owners as well.
4,works for us,"After the first application the fleas completely disappeared within several days. Fortunately, the fleas have not returned and our dogs have not experienced any side-effects. Application is amazingly simple and the dogs don't seem to even notice it. We love Frontline Plus! We purchased two small dogs who became riddled with fleas. We tried flea baths, spraying the yard, vacuuming, copycat flea repellent products, etc.. Nothing got rid of the fleas until we tried Frontline Plus."
4,flEA/TICK CONTROL,I have used this product for a long time and find it very effective for fleas and ticks.
1,Ugh... terrible,"I first applied this product 3 weeks ago. The fleas were manageable at that time. Now my house is completely infested. My dogs are miserable, and so am I because every time I get near them I get bitten by fleas. Today I used a flea comb on my dogs. I got 7 fleas off of one of them and at least one of the fleas was pregnant. I thought Frontline was supposed to prevent that. I called Frontline and they said this is normal, that it can take up to 3 months for the flea population to die out, but I am not satisfied with that. I've seen a lot of bad reviews of Frontline lately, I only bought it because it's what I'm used to, but go with Advantage instead. This is a terrible product.UPDATE: I have used up the three month supply and still have fleas. I'm switching to Advantage."
1,Illegal Usage of Diverted Product,"Merial only sells to veterinarians. All other product has changed hands several times and cannot be trusted. In addition, splitting product like this is against EPA rules and regulations. The EPA has already been notified and is building a case against all sellers of adulterated products. The fines carry hefty charges and possible jail time since endagerment to human health is a real possibility. Buyer beware!Frontline, bought from your vet, is backed by Merial. If bought from your vet, they will help with break through flea problems and bad reactions to the product."
2,Does not deter ticks,"We use this on our dog every month, and she has gotten two ticks so far this month! It seems to work with fleas, but is not helpful for ticks."
1,Dont Purchase!,"I have 3 Samoyeds and live in Florida. My dogs spend very little time outside due to temperature yet have recently been infested with fleas. Anyhow, after wasting money at Walmart on some inexpensive flea medicine I decided to pay for Frontline Plus. Unfortunately this also turned out to be a huge waste of money. I have applied the Frontline Plus twice and honestly see very little difference in the level of flea infestation. I understand that having Samoyeds I am dealing with very long, dense fur but as far as Frontline is concerned I would never recommend this product and have found it to also be a huge waste of money. Off to the Vet for some real meds! Dont waste your time or money!"
3,Seems great for 3 weeks per application,"My dog, who is just at 90 pounds soaking wet was scratching and bothered by something (very likely a Flea, by the way she was chasing it pround her body) I was never able to find, but it definitely was biting and bothered her 3 weeks after the first application of the season. I used the 89-132 pound Frontline Plus. The following 24 hours after the application, I noticed she requires much more water and a lot of panting goes on. After that kind of reaction, I'd expect a product that works well. I've never used anything other then Frontline Plus, but will start looking closer at other products."
5,Frontline puts out a good product,"I always thought that this stuff appeared way to expensive but its worth it if you care anything for you dog. I first tried a flea collar and it just smelled, looked ugly, irritated my dogs skin, and did nothing for the fleas! Finally, I broke down and bought this and have been happy ever since!"
3,is it just the heat?,"The item shipped promptly.I have always used this product for my dog. Usually it works. This time my dog had fleas after only 2-3 weeks since the application. ( I apply monthly, she is allergic to fleas). The local ma/pa pet store said it could be due to the triple digit heat wave and that I could re-apply after 3 weeks in this case. I have tried that and the fleas seem to be gone again."
1,This product is not working.,I bought this product for my dog. I have not seen any improvement in her flea problem. I called the company and got nowhere. I even suggested that maybe I had just gotten a bad batch of the product. They continue to say that I have to use the product for 3 months before they will give me my money back. I took my dog to the vet today and they even confirmed that my dear dog is covered in fleas. I will never ever use their product again with such an uncaring company policy. I believe that my dog does deserve better. By the way yes I have followed all the direction on the box and even treated my yard for fleas.
5,Exactly as advertised,"Received on the date specified, product exactly as advertised, couldn't be happier, beats having to wait in line at the store."
4,Itch,This work well for our long haired doggie. I gets rid of any problems he has with fleas and doesnt give him any allergic reactions.
2,didn't work,My dog got 2 ticks and fleas while on this product. I had to switch to something else. I live in upstate NY so I don't know if that has something to do with the kinds of fleas and ticks we get.
1,Formula,Frontline does not seem to work in Maine. I guess the ticks have figured out the formula?? I switched to advantixx and no more ticks or fleas!
4,Works well,This product works well. It arrived promptly and has been keeping our household flea free. Pretty good deal also compared to other places.
1,Did not work at all.,Our flea problem in So FL is so bad that nothing is working. It is a constant struggle. I'm going back to AdvantixII like my vet recommended.
4,Merial Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control,The high price of this product is the only negative. The product works well and is easy to apply. Perhaps competitive products will result in a reduction in the price.
5,Pet Comfort,This product is one of the best out there. It works really well and the pets have no problem with it. We would order it again.
2,Slow acting,"This stuff is very slow acting if it acts at all.It kills eggs, which means it neither kills nor repels fleas that bite the dog.I've used it before and it does reduce fleas if you use it over the course of a year.If you start using it in mid season, you're still going to get a lot of fleas hopping on and biting the dog."
4,no bugs,I have been useing this for years and there has not been any flea infestations at my house the entire time.
1,So many bad reviews in 2011 . . .,Got from vet last year--worked; got from Amazon this year--still have fleas. I think we should all ask for refunds.
2,Fleas still a problem,Our vet has recommended that we use this product every 3 weeks as it has not been killing fleas like it used to. Other pet owners we know are having the same problem. It used to be an effective product. Maybe the fleas have built up a tolerance to it. We sure wish it worked better.
1,Does Not Work!,"This product does nothing for fleas. It used to work, but recently it has not helped in the slightest with keeping the fleas off of my pets (3 dogs and 2 cats.) I agree with others who have said that fleas have become immune to frontline. My pets are being driven crazy from fleas and they look absolutely pitiful! I am going to be trying a different product."
5,It works,"My dog is in the woods every day, all through tick season, and never has a tick; he plays at the dog park with many other dogs, and feral cats wander through my back yard, but he never has a flea. He also goes swimming three or four time a week, but Frontline Plus just keeps on working. Highly recommended!"
5,Frontline Plus - Dogs,Frontline Plus medication is the best for Tick and Flea control. Why not price shop your pets medication. Same product that you purchase at the vet without the mark up - better price delivered right to your door.
2,Great Price - Poor results,"I have used Frontline many times before but always have purchased it from the vet's office. It has always worked wonderfully. The price was so much less online that I decided to try buying it here. However, the Frontline that I received was either expired or something because it was completely ineffective. My dogs are covered in fleas only a week after application. I will not be buying this product online again."
2,Frontline DOESN'T work anymore!,"I gave this product a two star vs one, because it served me well till this year. After three applications with only 18 days apart, my dog keeps getting a flea or two here and there. She is allergic to fleas, and even one would torture her. My vet has mentioned that he stopped carrying FrontPlus because dogs keep getting fleas while on medication. He sees it more and more now. Are fleas getting immuned to it???? I guess now I have to go and leave more money, buy Capstar to solve the problem. I wished Frontline would do something about it."
1,Doesn't work anymore,We've always used Frontline on our dog but this Summer it doesn't seem to be working at all. After 2 weeks of putting it on our dog is scratching and has irritated skin. We talked to our vet and he said Frontline isn't working as well anymore because it is no longer sold by prescription and has saturated the market and fleas have built up an immunity to it.
1,Frontline,"For some reason, Frontline doesn't work for my dog. Advantage did but I bought a 6 month supply of Frontline on sale and I noticed fleas on the dog a couple days after using it. I was told the fleas would fall off but within days he's covered with them. I did everything as instructed but it was a waste of time and money. I have three months supply left and will throw it away. Useless."
2,Does not work as well as k9 advantix,"I switched from K9 Advantix to Frontline because it was cheaper, and my dog started suffering from fleas. I had to buy some Advantix after wasting my money on the frontline to get rid of the fleas.Big waste of money for me."
1,wrong,The picture is not what I received. The box I got is frontline but is from a different country. I figure that it is safe to use on my dog but I decided not to since the box is not the same.
2,No longer Effective,"We have used Frontline on our dogs for 6+ years and never had a single flea. This past month is the exception. We discovered last night that both of our dogs have fleas and the frontline isn't supposed to wear off for another week. They do not have access to water to go swimming and they were only bathed one time less than a week ago. So, I know it isn't from me washing it off of them before it absorbs.It was awesome for many years, but sadly no longer effective. If you do use the product, constantly monitor you pet and home for any signs of fleas."
4,No more hotspots? I hope not,"My 14 year old border collie never had hotspots before last Fall when we moved to Southern California. She is used to running and exploring trails in the hills. When a vet suggested that perhaps fleas picked up on adventures into the foothills here were the source of her hotspots, I was really torn about whether to stop the walks that we both enjoy so much.Though we found no physical evidence of fleas, I decided to use Frontline just in case. After a month, we have not experienced any hotspots in spite of much energetic rolling in the grass. Given the high price of this product in pet stores and veterinary offices, it was a relief to find it for a more reasonable price on Amazon.I recommend this product if there is any question that there are fleas or ticks in your area."
4,Frontline,Frontline is the best of the products we have tried. And the best deal for it is on Amazon.
2,Frontline doesnt seem to work anymore!,"I have given frontline to my dogs before, however this past year it seems like it has not done the trick. I cant find anything that works, and my vet and everyone else has told me the same:("
1,Didnt work so well for us,"I expected more from this product. We tried this natural spray at Kaymart that worked even worse. Maybe the Frontline needs several months to work, but based on the results we had with the first application, we are unsatisfied. Our vet told us this was the only product that would absolutely get rid of fleas, but it did not work. About a week after we applied it to our dog, we noticed that she still had fleas. It says that it will continue to work for up to three months, but it did not for us. I will try it once more after a month has past but so far, not working too well."
5,The product does what it claims to do,"Gone are the old days when I would spend over $100 for multiple products claiming to get my pets rid of fleas with little to no result. Remember the frustration? I am highly sensitive to fleabites, so I got pretty angry that there is an array of products on the market out there just NOT doing what they claim. Never buy Hartz products for your pets by the way, these are harmful, especially to cats!Then, I found Frontline for both my dog and cat and started using it religiously, every month (1 single dose/month), from spring to autumn. ALL the fleas were gone. I didn't have to use any other product to back this one up. It works, and fast. Do something good for your pets. Buy this product! The doses are expensive but well worth it. Nothing else works like it."
5,Least expensive anywhere,I have 3 dogs so I count on the savings here to be able to protect my pups. My vet cannot offer this product at this price. I have also come to count on the quick turn-around on service.
5,Great,These keep my dogs from getting fleas and ticks. I can also get them a lot cheaper online than I can at the vet.
5,Frontline,"Amazing stuff. If everyone who owns a pet would use this on them, there would not be a flea and tick problem. We have four dogs inside. Never have a flea or tick...EVER..."
2,Super fleas,"I've been using Frontline products for years and not had any trouble. This year, the Frontline doesn't seem to be as effective against the fleas. When i asked my vet, they told me that a lot of people had been having problems with the fleas while using Frontline. The fleas seem to becoming resistant to some of the flea products like K9 Advantix, Advantage and Frontline. The vet suggested Vectra 3D as an alternative that seems to still be effective. I'm trying that next month."
5,Effective,This product is very effective on controlling fleas on both cats and dogs. My dog developed a flea allergy last year and the vet recommended this product and she's been on it ever since with no problems.
4,"Works for me, no negative effects for my 10 lb Dachshund","The horror stories relating to this product scared me a bit but I've experienced no problems with my 10 lb mini Dachshund.Don't let the negative reviews sway you, the positive effects of this product far outweigh the small possibility of a negative physical reaction. It's human nature to be more likely to post a review if you've had a bad experience with a beloved family pet.My only gripe, I wish it didn't cost $10 per month."
1,"fake, fake fake!...oct. 28th 2012","ok first of all seller changes his seller name all the time, so beware of that. do not rely on looking for the name of a BAD seller to do more shopping! 2nd. they advertise this product as FRONTLINE PLUS! BUT WHEN YOU CLICK THEIR AD, the product is FRONTLINE TOP SPOT!....not the same , and it is the reason it is cheap. look it up...frontline top spot does NOT kill flea larvae or eggs, so you only kill the adults. not good and a waste of money!**** HONESTLY IT IS A big GAMBLE TO BYE FRONTLINE ANYMORE HERE. hard to catch the scammer!"
1,Not effective anymore!,"I have been using Frontline for a long time with my animals. Unfortunately, the fleas have become immune to Frontline. I started finding fleas on my dog this summer. I supplemented with flea shampoos AND giving Frontline more frequently (every 3 weeks instead of every 4). I also fogged and sprayed the house. (More $$$) This didn't help- my poor dog still had fleas. He scratched and scratched and gave himself a swollen ear. After $500 of surgery and meds for the ear- I am switching to Revolution Flea Control (and that seems to be working!!).Several vets I have talked to, and several dog owners, tell me that the fleas seem to have become immune to whatever Frontline uses. One vet tells me that he is sending back all his unused Frontline supply and will not carry it anymore."
2,zeb,I have used Frontline on my Golden for the last seven years with great results until this year. I put it on him and two weeks later he had fleas! I called the vet and they said I could apply it every two weeks. I put it on four times in eight weeks and he still had fleas!! I called the vet and ended up buying pills (3) for $51.00 and the first pill took care of the problem! Has Frontline changed the formula?? It doesn't work like it used to!!
1,Do not buy Frontline Plus.,Product is not working. Had to reapply after 21 days. My dogs are going crazy with ticks galore. Will never buy this product again.
1,Absolutely ineffective against fleas in my area.,"Always check with your vet, even if buying online. They will have a better understanding if the fleas around you have developed an immunity to a particular flea treatment. Had I known that my vet no longer even carries Frontline due to its uselessness here, I would not have wasted time and money on this product. I am glad to know there are alternatives. Hopefully Merial is in the process of reformulation; too bad they do not stand by their product. Nevertheless I have informed them of the lot number and the complete ineffectiveness of this item at my location."
5,Always the best price on Amazon,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must. I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks. Free shipping, packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO, no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus. Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective. I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too. Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
5,Flea and tick free,I've been using Frontline Plus on my 2 small dogs for years now and have yet to encounter a flea or tick incident. Now as to whether that is sheer luck or a result of the product I cannot honestly say but I'm happy with the results so I will continue using it.
4,Frontline economy package,"Pros:Easy to follow instructions, keeps my dog free from Fleas, saves money! Ordered on Friday and received on the following Monday.Cons:I thought this was also for ticks. It is not. Because a Flea and tick product was listed underneath the description for this item, I thought this was for ticks too. We don't usually have a problem with ticks so this was worth buying at this great price."
1,Caution: this seller is not clear that these are bulk doses,"I purchased this product in the six-dose size and expected to receive six individually-packaged tubes of medication. Instead I received two jumbo-sized tubes, a dosing sheet, one single-use 1 ml syringe, and an empty vial. Apparently they are selling bulk doses, but they do not make this clear in the product description. So the expectation is that you dispense the bulk dose into the small vial, read the dosing sheet, measure the proper dose, and store the extra. And by the way, the single-use 1 ml syringe is not enough to administer a single dose for my 40 lb dog (at least according to the enclosed dosing sheet), so I had to administer it in two goes. Some people might be comfortable with this: I find it a huge hassle and with a lot of opportunities to spil the medication or provide too much or too little. Do yourself a favor and find someone who sells individual doses if you don't want to deal with all this."
2,Doesn't kill ticks or repel mosquitoes,"If you live in a wooded area (particularly in the northeast US), you might want to use Advantix instead. Advantix repels mosquitoes (and Frontline doesn't), and it also does a better job than Frontline in killing ticks. My dog was on Frontline, but ticks were still crawling all over him. The switch to Advantix has helped a lot."
2,Didn't Work for Me,"After countless recommendations by friends, family, and vets I decided to give it a shot. It really didn't do much. I have 2 Dachshunds and a Miniature Pincher that stay inside the majority of the time. They only go outside to potty. I can't say it didn't work cause they did have ""less"" fleas but, it wasn't worth the money at all. Just last night I picked 10 fleas off my min pin. I live out in the country so perhaps that has something to do with it but I have read many reviews that said it works in the country as well. Perhaps I have a hybrid breed of fleas that are immune to FrontLine?"
5,Good quality,"Purchased this for flea control for our dog, and am very pleased with the price and the product."
5,Frontline PLus,It is the only product i will ever use on my cats and my dog. my animals have never had a flea or tick since i started using frontline plus. Great product highly recommended. Great price too. Will come back to buy more.
5,"No Ticks, No Fleas Pleases Me","My Great Pyrenees with the long dense hair is a tick magnet. I picked ticks for hours last year. This year I used Frontline and the ticks are still there, BUT NOW THEY ARE DEAD!!. It is like tick suicide, they take a bite of my dog and die. Oh, and he doesn't scratch for fleas either. The cheapest place that I found it was here on Amazon ordered from AA Playful Pets. I got a 3 month supply for about $32. This stuff is great and AA Playful Pets shipped super fast."
5,Happy pets,Frontline keeps my 2 labs tick and flea free even after romps in the woods and rolls in the grass.
4,Liking Frontline Plus for 88-132# dogs to split for multiple dogs,"I have a dog sanctuary, Silverwalk Beagle & Hound Sanctuary on Petfinder in MO. Buying each size Frontline Plus for 19 different sized dogs is very cost prohibitive, so I am able to use this size and divide it w/a formula from my vet. The price almost can't be beat except by a Canadian firm I am checking out....so, thanks, Amazon - dogs rule."
1,Frontline Minus?,"I waited 2 days after giving my dog a bath to put the Frontline Plus on her. She had a couple fleas on her, so I checked the next day. She seemed to have a few more fleas so I figured the product had not taken effect yet. I checked the next day and still found fleas on her. Same thing the next day and the day after that. I looked for an expiration date on the package which I thought there had to be, but there was no expiration date. I'm not sure where they pulled this box from, but it must have been the oldest one in inventory."
2,Lacking...,This product worked on my dog... for about 2 weeks. I feel ripped off. I'll be trying another product.
3,Outdoor dog,There is a reservation near our home and our westie mix loves taking hikes there. We go every morning and we always need to look for ticks when we get home. I wouldn't recommend this product to outdoor dogs.
2,Frontline Plus,"I used frontline on my dog. This is the second time I bought this particular product from Amazon. I think this frontline product is not as effective as it could be. My dog is near the weight limit for this product, but even so ,I expected a greater deal of effectiveness in terms of flea and tick control than the frontline presented. It is supposed to be good as a flea and tick deterrent for one month, but he had a tick bite within 3 days. I don't know if it is because the product has been in the wharehouse at Amazon for awhile, or what it is, but I won't be buying frontline through Amazon again."
2,Complications and issues of the medicine,"First of all, my cats and dog still have fleas. We have a golden retriever and 2 small cats. Used 2 vials for the dog, and 1/2 each for the cats, as directed on the box. The fleas did reduce, but they are still there. So either the product didn't work like it was supposed to or we have a different strain of fleas than the cat and dog fleas.Second, I don't know if it is because of the medicine or just coincidence, but 3 days after the dose, one of our cats died! He had diabetes, and ended up dying of kedoacidosis. The medicine may have assisted in the complications of his diabetes which caused the kedoacidosis. SO DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOUR CATS HAVE DIABETES!!!Third, our other cat has lost a lot of hair where we put the medicine on the back of his neck.. Hopefully this will grow back, but right now it's highly unattractive.I will never buy this product again, and I suggest you be very cautious with your purchase as well."
4,Frontline Plus for Dogs,"I have used Frontline Plus for years for my current dog and former one. It can be fairly expensive. Found the best price on Amazon. Even with shipping, it was cheaper than local vets and other websites offering pet supplies."
5,my animals are happy,"Excellent price, fast shipping. Would recommend everyone needing this product use this seller at the best price. Very happy."
3,product packaging is in kg not lbs,"Slightly annoyed that the packaging pictured for this flea and tick product was different than what I received in the mail. The packaging on amazon displayed the product in lbs, which would be distributed in the US obviously. The packaging I received referred to the dog's weight in kilograms and clearly not packaged for the United States. It appears to be what is sold in Australia. Hope it's an authentic Merial product that kills the fleas, but not my dog."
4,It works!,"Don't really have much to say - my dog doesn't have fleas or ticks so it looks like its working. I also like that the effectiveness of each dose is up to 3 months for fleas, Advantix is only a month so this will go further if you're in an urban area without ticks. It is a little runnier than Advantix but once its under the fur, its only a problem for a few hours (we run around in the park for that time)."
1,FAKE or OLD medicine,"I have been applying the frontline purchased from this company on my dog for the past 3 months. Lately, she has had a rash. I didn't even think it could be fleas because she has been treated with Frontline purchased from this company for the past three months. I took my dog to the vet today because she has been itching and scratching and has a skin infection. All the hair at the base of her tail has fallen off. I thought she might have allergies or even mange. It Turns out SHE HAS FLEAS and an allergic reaction (dermatitis) to the fleas. So, the vet told me that most online sellers of frontline either sell old or fake frontline because frontline is only guaranteed when bought at a vet. So $265 dollars later, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory shots and having to purchase REAL FRONTLINE from the vet, HERE I AM.... A VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER. Obviously my frontline did not work."
4,Flea Free!,"The product works. I rescued a puppy covered in fleas, and after applying this product our little pup has remained flee free."
2,Frontline Plus flea and tick control,"I had been using Frontline flea control on my Yorky for sometime and never had a problem untilthis Spring and Summer. I used it faithfully every month. My groomer started telling me that she would have a flea now and then, I wasn't concerned untilthis started happening every month, more fleas. My Yorky started having allergy spots on her from the flea bites. Many dollars later, I switched toComfortis through my Vet, problem solved. I always bought my Frontline through Amazon, ""I'm just sayin"". I wrote Merial about my concerns, they must havethrown my letter in the trash, no response. No more Frontline for us. Something has changed and I don't think it was my dog."
3,not lasting,"I have used frontline plus for over 10 years. It has always been great for fleas and ticks. Over the last 6 months I have found it only works for 2-3 weeks after application. By about 2 1/2 weeks I am starting to see fleas, by 3 weeks they are biting the dogs, making them itchy and it is not killing them. I plan to call the manufacturer as I have 4 dogs and buy this in bulk for the year."
2,Won't order again,"Amazon was great as usual. Shipping was fast. The frontline plus was a disappointment though. We regularly have our yard sprayed for fleas, plus apply flea medicine for the dog. After trying the frontline plus, the dog was flea-free for a few days, but by 2 weeks was miserable again. She is an outside dog, so this may work differently for an inside one. I will be trying something else next time."
3,Flea treatment,"I'm a bit disappointed, I treated my dog and my cats with their respective flea treatments, and they are still scratching! (I know it is fleas and not something else, since every once in a while I catch one of the little buggers!)I recall that I treated my dog last year and it was more effective, but unfortunately I can't recall which product it was that I used..."
2,didn't work this time? Sept 2010,"Ok, so I have a Scottish Terrier that has severe flea allergy and we have used frontlineplus for almost 4 years with no problems, and not one flea.The past few months that I have used this recent order from amazon.com she got fleas at the end of themonth. I am assuming either I got a bad batch, or it didn't work the full month.Either way, I am scared to use frontline plus for her anymore. She got huge sores, whelps, hairloss and it cost me 150.00 in vet bills as well as more money buying other prevention and differentshampoos for her."
4,"Frontline Plus, A minus for head ticks","Generally does a good job of keeping fleas & ticks off of the dog's body. However, I see ticks around the head. It's better not to let the dogs get wet for three days."
5,its great,"first of all, the price was great, especially since I have 2 big dogs, so this last for 6 months, frontline has been in my dogs life since they were little dogs and I have had great great results, went to Idaho and they never had ticks and they ran thru the woods everyday for 2 months, they've never had fleas, I swear by the frontline, however I do use it as they so to every month, the cost was great considering most places sell 3 for 54.00. thank you very much"
4,Same as vet,Ignore some of the other posts. This is the same thing as you get at the vet. No problems here.
5,seeing is believing i really happy,"after traid whith shampoo ,spray and not see change in my puppy , i find frontline , the same day disappeared all the fleas in my puppy 3 months german shepred . is the best product for puppys and have the best price"
1,Frontline,The company/persons shipping this product were Great. no issues there. But i dislike frontline it never works. i get advantage now and is AMAZING.
5,"Flea, and more importantly tick free!",I have always used Frontline for flea protection but when we moved to a house in a wooded area we soon realized we needed tick protection as well. The first winter we lived in our house our dogs were covered in ticks. Our vet suggested we switch to Frontline Plus and it has been a life changer. I haven't seen more than a small handful of ticks on our dogs since we switched and usually if we find a tick it is dead. So glad this medicine is effective. Now if only I could convince our dogs because they are not fans of their flea/tick medicine.
4,Expensive but it works,"I have used this on three different dogs and it works better than anything else I have tried, but it is expensive, so i suggest trying a cheaper product first and seeing if it will do the job in your particular area."
3,"seems to work, but expensive","As I only purchased this near the end of the season, I really can't tell how good it is. In spring of 2013 I will have a better idea."
4,Frontline Flea and Tick control,My Dog had fleas prior to applying this product. Frontline had produced results in less than three days.
4,Good buy,"Definately helps a lot, although hasn't completely eliminated the fleas yet as we had a very bad infestation. I think by the end of the second treatment, we should be done with the flea issues. My dog is much happier. Other treatments we tried were very hard on his skin, or didn't work at all. This is working, and not affecting his skin adversly. Yay!"
1,ABSOLUTE JUNK!,I APPLIED THIS TO MY DOGS. A WEEK LATER THEY WERE STILL INFESTED WITH FLEAS AND MERIAL TOLD ME TO GET MY MONEY BACK I WOULD HAVE TO USE IT FOR TWO MORE MONTHS AND THEN THEY WOULD REFUND THE COST FOR ONE MONTH. WHAT MORON CAME UP WITH THAT POLICY? IT ISN'T WORKING AND THEY WANT ME TO USE IT LONGER??... WHILE MY DOGS ARE SUFFERING? HAD TO PUT FLEA COLLARS ON THEM FOR RELIEF. MERIAL CAN GO POUND SALT!
5,Cannot Trust Asena,"The product is good. No Complaint about it. But never trust Asena Shop. It never replies your e-mail if you want to return. I lost $69.95 without opening the item b/c its ignorance while returning items, even I followed its procedure."
1,Still waiting...almost a month now,"unable to get assistance from amazon, something about this vendor not actually being an amazon company??????????????? awful shady...Amazon did take my money"
1,not us approved frontline!,I recently ordered this frontline plus and after searching in internet believe the product is not labeled for sale in the us and/or is fake! I will not order flea product from amazon again.
5,Frontline Plus,I have been using this product on my dogs since it came out on the market. Amazon is the least expensive
2,Doesn't work here,"First, I don't like putting these products on my dogs. They're so chemical heavy, and I'm not even one of those people who rant about chemicals.But, the past few years have been horrible tick wise. Dogs were even picking them up just from our back yard. I went with frontline and discovered it did not work against ticks here in NE Illinois. Switched to K9 Advantix and found that worked much better for me."
3,"Happy, but with mixed feelings...","I had no problem with the company that sent me the product, but the product didn't seem to be as effective as in times passed. It might be because we have a really bad flea season this year."
2,Itchy,I've applied the med per instruction. This month is the second dose. The Big Guy still scratches as if nothing has been applied. I'll give him the 3 months supply and see how it turns out. If there's little change. I'll try a different product for less cost.
5,Vey good,"This is my 1st time , I don't know exactly how well it work because my puppy (17 months ) almost in door. I just afraid when he out back yard , he sit on the lawn & the ground . I just in case but when I put on him he seem like no itching , but I bath him , he very clean . And that help too. So far no problem , very good for the price"
4,Effective,"I live in the country where there are fleas and ticks everywhere, I tried flea and tick baths for my dog but they weren't cutting it, I put this stuff on in 24 hour he had almost no itching left. I know he is quite relieved."
5,Frontline is Amazing !!,"I had never had a problem with fleas on my dog until I brought home two adorable kittens. I only saw a few fleas at first then within days I was fighting an uphill battle. I had bought flea shampoos, combs, washed and vacuumed everything in site and flea treatments for everyone that were 'on sale'. BIG mistake!!Though their numbers were down, the fleas were winning. I called my mother-in-law and she swore by Frontline. I searched all over and found the best price on Amazon.com. The day it came was a memorable day. It was the day the fleas left. Okay, it took a full 24 hours but I could tell by my animal's behavior that it was working.FRONTLINE ANYTIME!!!"
5,Frontline saved us!,Our dog (and house and us) had fleas pretty bad before we figured out what was going on. Frontline was a huge help in getting rid of them!!
2,Not what I hoped for!,I used the Frontline plus on my dog and it worked for about a week. The fleas returned and I was still seeing them in the house. I was so grossed out by the fleas. We had the carpets cleaned the day after we treated our dog. We ended up getting Advantix K9 from our vet and it has worked and we have not seen fleas in the house. I feel like I wasted money on this product.
4,Works great on my Beagle!,"Living in South Florida, we have fleas all over teh place. I tried others, they didn't work. This worked really well. My dog is now flea free."
5,Great Product,I have purchased this product for my first dog for 11 years and my second dog for 3 years. Never any issues and no ticks in Wisconsin !
5,Fast shipment and same as more higher priced frontline plus products sold from other vendors.,Excellent flea and tick product. Acts quickly. Have used it for over five years with no side effects to my 10 year old lab.
3,FLEA BATH BEFORE USE,VET. TOLD ME I DIDN'T NEED TO GIVE MY DOG A FLEA BATH BEFORE USE BECAUSE HE ONLY HAD A FEW FLEAS..........I THINK HE WAS WRONG! I HAVE BEEN USING PRODUCT FOR TWO MONTHS AND I STILL FIND A FEW FLEAS DURING HIS DAILY BRUSHING
2,Works as good as any flea medicine...kills a few but not all,"Why is it so hard to find something that actually works? They all pretty much do the same thing, kill some fleas while others survive. It seems like a very over priced thing (flea medication in general) since it only works somewhat. But better than a total infestation, so we buy it anyway."
3,FLEA ASSUALT! Maybe it works?,"I've heard great things about Frontline so I went with this for my 22lbs German Shepard puppy. It's almost time for Her second dose but, the only thing I've noticed is that Ticks are annihilated but Fleas remain an issue. I've taken care of bathing Her along with treating our Living area with flea powder & vacuuming frequently. Maybe it takes a couple of months to begin destroying fleas but for now I'm not satisfied. I will keep the faith with Frontline for now."
4,Happy Happy Joy Joy,This product came really quickly and now I have no more fleas. Thank you Frontline Happy Happy Joy Joy. This Stuff really works
4,decent product,"Frontline seems to be a pretty good product, I've used it for 5 ish years, it works well on most but not all my animals. and I would recommend this product to other people."
4,more comfortable for my dog,"It's hard to determine effectiveness, but it is definitely more comfortable for my dog. We have used Advantix because it claims to repel ticks, but after the application my dog seems very uncomfortable for the next few days. I'm not sure if it's from the ingredients or from the application itself (you apply it in multiple spots down the dog's back), but she seems far more comfortable after using Frontline (which is applied to only 1 spot)."
1,"FRONTLINE PLUS MAKES A KILLING,","just not on fleas. Does a GREAT job on making a killing on the amount charged for their product though!!!! (wonder if it's actually placebo's???) Just joking of course, but I do wonder what the stuff actually is, as it sure doesn't kill fleas. I have an indoor cocker spaniel (mix) that barely weighs 22 lbs, so this product for medium dogs from 23-44 lbs SHOULD OF WORKED rather well on my dog. I bought the 3 pack and applied one packet per month until all 3 were used. At the end of 3 months my dog still had the flea problem. I telephoned Merial to complain, and was told by them that you had to apply a 6 months supply to effectively rid the pet of fleas. I then went and bought another 3 pack and applied the same monthly treatment for another continuing 3 months. Bottom line; Still have the fleas!!! Guess I'll just use a good flea shampoo and tweezers from now on!!! :-("
2,Deceptive advertising/ labeling,"I've been using frontline plus for awhile now (bought it straight from the vet). After spending time in the woods or camping I've found many ticks on my dogs; most of which have been bit into the skin.I called frontline customer line and told them this. The woman said that this was perfectly normal, and that frontline is not a preventative tick medicine. Frontline works by killing ticks within 24-48 hours of biting into the dog!!! Doing a little research online I found that 36hrs is the average time that a Tick could potentially begin to transmit Lyme disease. Some ticks begin transmitting the disease immediately.Dog owners need to know that frontline is better than nothing, and will kill ticks, but not necessarily before they are able to transmit disease to your dog.... This fact was confirmed by frontline's customer support line."
5,Frontline,Great product to eliminate flea infestations on both your pet and in your home.This was the best price I found.
5,Works Great!,This is the best flea and tick product out there. We have been using this for years and haven't had any ticks or fleas on our cat and our dog or even in the home.
1,DOES NOT WORK AT ALL,"This flea killer doesn't work at all. I put on the first dose and nothing happened. The fleas were still dancing around like crazy and none died. I waited. Two weeks later I put on a second dose. I know the package says not to do that, but If it doesn't kill the fleas I really doubt it would hurt the dog... Anyway, I applied a second dose and those fleas are still alive and kicking... and multiplying like crazy... And all this time I'm also using the flea comb on the dog trying to give the dog some relief. The fleas I caught in the flea comb were just happy campers, not even woozy from the Frontline! So, it doesn't work at all. I want my $60 back! Maybe it's counterfit or something, I don't know. But it does not work. I've now added a flea collar AND still using the flea comb every day and still the fleas keep having more babies... UGH! I'm so tired of this!"
1,Worst Flea Medicine on the market,"I live in Texas, my vet recommend this flea medicine very highly. It simply did not work, the vet recommend shampoo, treatment of the house, then the yard. It was very costly and still my poor dog suffered with a flea problem. I checked with others and was told that Frontline was simply worthless and that I needed to try K-9 Advantix. It worked on the first application and I have not had another problem; and yes, I changed vet too! I would not recommend Frontline to anyone under any circumstance!"
1,Didn't prevent fleas,"The Frontline Plus flea and tick control for 45 to 88 pound dogs was worse than a disappointment. My dog is 50 pounds--well within the dosage range and become infested with fleas during the second month/dosage of usage. I'm not sure if the preventative actually worked the first month or if I just didn't notice the fleas until the fleas had multiplied enough for me to easily see them. I also don't know if I received the same quailty Frontline product through Amazon as a store/vet purchase. I have no reason to think that this was an imitation product other than some suspicions by other reviewers. Regardless, I had to use a flea dip and flea bomb my house. Once an infestation occurs, getting rid of the fleas is quite an aggravation. I'm trying Advantage II from PetSmart now to see if that will work. Hopefully, something will."
1,Totally ineffective this year,Like many other reviewers I found this product ineffective. After three weeks and two vials there is no visible reduction in my dog's flea infestation. Please read the many recent reviews that support this before you buy.
1,Not sold by Amazon!!,"Although this product says ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"" when I ordered it, my order was sent to two ""merchants"" instead. Not only did I not get my items in two days like my Prime membership gives me, but one had not shipped at all three days later and the other one charged me shipping, which is still slow. AT NO TIME did I do anything different than I have a billion times when placing this order so I don't understand how this happened. I understand how to buy from other merchants and I did NOT do that in this case. The only help I got from Amazon customer service was ""that is how the order was placed, sorry."" I am VERY disappointed with Amazon for the first time in my 13 or so years ordering from them. Good thing I turned off One-Click ordering."
2,Not what I expected.,Product came in a tube with a syringe. Expected the box with six doses. Very unhandy. Not what I thought I was ordering. Bad advertising.
4,Good for dogs,"My dog hates this item, but it seems to have helped her. Hopefully with the fall coming up and the forecast of more fleas, we will help her get through it."
3,Flea prevention and protection,"I tried this product at the recommendation of a friend. I have a pet who has a severe flea allergy and had proviously been using advantage (it was not controlling the fleas). I am sorry to say that this product is failing as well. I will be ordering Revolution from now on. It is more expensive, but does work."
3,Mildly disappointed,"While Frontline Plus was able to get rid of most fleas, my 72 lbs lab/mix still has a flea problem. She's not infested with them, but a handful are still/always present. I think I will go back to revolution after my 3 month supply of Frontline is completed."
3,different item,"We were sent the European version of this item.. Nowhere was this mentioned in the description. It should be ok, but the percentages of active ingredients is different."
5,Frontline Combo review,"The product I ordered was Frontline Plus. The product I received was Frontline Combo, which I think is the same. So I'm very happy with the product and price!"
3,Not great on a Rough Collie,"I have a Rough Collie (Lassie type) that weighs around 80 lbs. He is groomed regularly and had been treated for fleas on his last two grooming visits. The groomer says fleas are really bad this year, so I wasn't surprised that he kept getting more. I ordered the Frontline and specifically got the dosage for a dog that's a bit larger because his coat is so thick. I used it as directed, applying it to his skin. It is now three weeks later and the dog is still pestered with fleas. I'm not sure anything is going to work on him. Maybe they need a special formulation for dogs with a thick coat."
5,Wonderful!,"I love Frontline Plus for my cats, but it gets expensive. And then when I moved to a new neighborhood I found a few stray cats too. Before finding them new homes, I had to use flea control meds and it definitely got expensive. I'm so glad this was created. I just hope that something like this can be created for the oral medication for Program too. I have some feral cats I can't touch and mixing Program in with their food is the only thing I can do, and that gets pricey too. I'm very blessed I make good money, but still..."
4,frontline for fleas--not so good,"I keep my Rottweiler on Frontline, as I take my dog in the woods fairly regularly. He gets a lot of ticks, which the Frontline works well. Recently however, he got a good case of fleas. The Frontline didn't seem to work at all on. I switched to Advantage. That worked much better."
3,Frontline Plus on Scottish Terrier,"I have been using Frontline Plus on my 19 pound Scottish Terrier for 24 months. On three occassions she has developed a flea problem in between application times. The most recent being last week. Her flea application was Nov 7, 2010 and not due again until Dec 7, 2010. However, after developing a flea problem last week, I had to bathe her and put on a new application Nov 22. I am becoming more skeptical that this product works as it is advertised. I do live in Southern California where fleas are almost a year round problem due to persons not cleaning up after their dogs."
3,Can't handle fleas,My English Springer Spaniel was having a small problem with fleas (we find one or two on him at any given time) and Frontline plus didn't do anything to help the problem. We're going to try K9 Advantix next...
2,Frontline Plus good for fleas not for ticks,"Our dog is an American Eskimo and we live in Miami, Florida. We have exterminated the yard, his bedding and had been using the Preventic Collar. We also used Rose Geranium oil, all with no success of the tick infestation on our dog.We finally tried Frontline Plus and it has been a couple of weeks now and we are still having the same tick problem. Adult ticks and baby ticks. It's not doing a thing to help get rid of the tick problem so far.There are no fleas at all and plenty of ticks on the dog every day."
1,Front line plus Vender,"I have used Frontline for years, and never have a had problems with the product until now. Not only did I pay for two packages I only received one. I still have not receive my money or the product from this vendor. Also the one product that I did receive it did NOT WORK, my dogs still have fleas."
1,Frontline Plus,"Our vet told us this was the only product that would absolutely get rid of fleas, but it did not work. About a week after we applied it to our dog, we noticed that she still had fleas. It says that it will continue to work for up to three months, but it did not for us. I'm going to try it again after her thirty days are up, just because I still have five tubes left. Hopefully it will work this time??? We did find an natural spray at Wal-Mart that works pretty good--no chemicals, either, which is a plus. (Also, tons cheaper.) Maybe the Frontline needs several months to work, but based on the results we had with the first application, we are unsatisfied."
3,Frontline,"Frontline is okay, but it did not completely take care of the minor flea problem like we anticipated."
1,Will never buy again,"I put Frontline Plus on my dogs May 13. They continued to be covered with fleas, so I put more on them less than 3 weeks later on June 1. This is June 22 and I have bathed them several times and used a flea comb to no avail. They are covered with fleas still. I have ordered another brand that has been recommended to my daughter and to me. I will never buy Frontline Plus again."
1,on line flea control was a no no,not effective. dog got fleas. went back to buying from the vet. I have never had a flea problem with my dog until I tried to save a little money and buy from here. It was a mess and I felt like a bad parent to my dog. Save yourself the guilt. Just buy at the vet.
1,It no longer works,"I used it for a few years but alas, probably because the fleas acquire resistance, it no longer works. I've switched to Advantix and it does. Of course, I'm concerned, societally, that as with antibiotics, it's an endless battle. I hope we keep developing effective (and safe!) flea controls and antibiotics, but it's hard to remain optimistic that we always will. Of course, the world may well have ended before then--for example, some terrorist scientist creating a highly communicable mutated smallpox virus that he released in a public place."
5,Works well,I try not to use on my dogs except for the hot summer months but it definitely works when I put it on my dogs.
3,I think it works,I have a siberian husky and i have always used this product. I think frontline actually works since there is no visible fleas on her although she scratches herself as if she had some (this is not often) One thing is it does not work for ticks. We go hiking ofter and even when this product claims to work for ticks up to 30 days from application day. I always find tick bites and have taken a few off her. so If you are looking for a tick repellent look elsewhere. Thats the reason for the 3 star rating.
3,Still have fleas,I used one dose that proved to be useless. It was like I didn't even use any preventative for fleas. The other two doses were fine.
2,Frontline,Frontline Doesn't work like it used tooUsed it for years then it just didn't work any morei switched
5,frontline plus,recommended over the years & lately by a dog lover with 2 Labs. It works! Dog had no probelm with it.SL
4,Good product,"Good product, Very difficult to control the fleas down in Florida the fleas get real active in the humid enviroment."
2,FRontline,"I chose this rating because I paid a fair price for this product and it seems as if it does not kill fleas! I'm not sure if they are immune to FRONTLINE or what it is. I am greatful that I had the opportunity to buy this product for my inside dogs who do play outside. I just want to say that even after a really good bath I applied this Frontline and it did not work on either of my pets and I applied it as the instructions stated. Someone else may have different results, I have been using Frontline for years, maybe the fleas in my neighborhood are immune to it, because it used to knock them dead!"
5,Positive review,I always use this stuff as it's the best I've found. This is the least expensive place I've found to buy it!
5,Protect my dog!!!!,"I have been using this product for five years now and buying it through the Vet. I decided to finally check around and found this site and it is 1/2 the price!!!! Maybe I shouldn't be saying this because they might raise the price, hopefully not, but I will definitely be buying Frontline and other products from you again. Service was excellent!!!! Thanks!!!"
5,very good,It was very good and that my dog does not scratch anymore. I am not afraid to touch my dog now that he has the frontline plus on him. Thank you.
5,Works much better than Advantix,"I have tried both products and for me this one seems to work the best. It keeps fleas away and ticks. I also use this with the Vibrac Preventic Tick collars. Before I started using this and the Preventic Collar, I was always finding ticks on my dogs. 5 and 6 at a time and they would be totally engorged by then. Now, I may find one or 2 baby ones on them, but get them before they can really bite the dogs, because something in this product repels them, so I really am a believer in this. I totally have seen the difference and can't live without it. I stock up on it because it runs out of stock often."
4,frontline works great,Frontline really works well controlling ticks /fleas. This is the second year I have used it and it really does keep my dog free from all those nasty pests. I would definitely recommend.
2,Not a help this year.,"Due to our last winter not being cold enough we have really had a big problem with fleas. I've been treating my pets with Advantix for years and it simply wasn't working this year. I read that I should try Frontline ( different chemical, maybe better results). But it didn't work either....I have sprayed their kennels, dog houses etc, even been treating them with DE. There are fewer fleas but they still have some. Will try a different product after this one's effects have worn off. The Advantage for cats if working great though. Don't think its the product, but for me it didn't help.Will pray for a cold winter, too."
4,Great Product,"Earlier this year I bought a different brand. It seemed to work, but needed to be applied more like every three weeks than the directed 30 days. Fleas are terrible and getting resistant to this stuff. I don't want to give my Dogs Comfortis (I'm convinced it gave one of my dogs seizures) so this is the next best thing. Frontline seems to work as well, if not better than the other products of this type.came via prime in 2 days!"
5,Excellent service,"I have used Frontline for about fifteen years and wouldn't use anything else. Fleas and ticks are no problem for my dog. I, however, get an occasional tick when working in the yard. They are everywhere around these parts. This purchase was very inexpensive and it was delivered as quick as one could want. I am very satisfied."
3,"It is so expensive, but it works","It is so expensive, but it works. After I apply it to my dogs anything left over just gets rubbed into my skin. I cant afford to waste any of it and dont want to give my dogs too much."
1,Did not work on ticks for my dogs,"This did not work on ticks for my dogs. A week later, I am still finding ticks on them after being treated with frontline. It says kills ticks within 12 hours, this is obviously not the case."
4,Great product!,Keeps my dog flea free for almost 30 days. I would recommend this flea treatment although it is a little messy. I've tried many others and have been very disappointed. Frontline Plus takes care of the fleas and their larvae. Very important when trying to keep your pet and home flea free!
2,Read the side effects - lethargy and siezures,"I have two goldendoodles, 65 and 75 pounds. I put the product on about 24 hours ago and noticed some unusual lethargy, which led me to google side effects for the product. I found a page on Amazon for the side effects, so it's not like the company is trying to hide anything. Still, some people report scary things like inability to walk and worsening siezures. I washed them off (hopefully that makes the side effects better, not worse, even if it makes the product ineffective), and I'm going to look up some of the herbal remedies people suggest.I live in Colorado, where ticks and fleas are not a bad problem - I had purchased this product for going on a trip to Missouri. If you live somewhere like Missouri, the health risks may be worth it for you - but be warned.I don't give one star because for all I know the product ""works"" despite its side effects!"
4,"Box arrived smushed in, but hoping all is ok.","We have used Fr. Line plus on our 2 australian shepherd dogs ever since Frontline first came out. Works well for us, tho' we also check our dogs for ticks, daily. Recently, our 14 year old aussie was diagnosed with anaplasma, a tick-borne disease. Was vaccinated vs. Lyme but not against this particular illness. Dog is on Doxycycline for 30 days. Wish the cost of this were less."
5,MY DOG HAS NO FLEA'S!!!!!!!,I HAVE A SMALL INDOOR DOG. AND A LARGE OUTDOOR DOG. BOTH OF THEM ARE HAPPY HEALTHY AND FLEA AND TICK FREE... I LOVE FRONTLINE AND SO DO MY DOGS....
1,Still have fleas.....,"First it took over a week to receive the product after it was shipped. It has now been three weeks and I don't see any difference in the control of fleas on my dog. I followed the directions in the package (it was not rocket science) and nothing happened. I have also had to continue to use flea spray when I see fleas, to try to control them. I checked the Frontline website for suggestions on what to do. The little questionnaire indicated the problem was probably the dog's environment. If the environment did not have fleas to start with, I wouldn't need Frontline. Therefore, I find this product a waste of money."
1,Not the same product!,"I ordered Frontline Plus for my mini schnauzer and it arrived this afternoon. When I opened the package, the box read Pet Armor Plus for Dogs with an added caption, ""compare to Frontline Plus"".I didn't want to compare something to Frontline, I wanted to use it! There is a disclaimer on the box that the product is not made by the makers of Frontline. Is that supposed to be good news? Even when you think you know what you are ordering, you don't know what you're going to get."
1,This does not work!!,I found fleas on my Pomeranian 1 week after treating her with Frontline Plus. I had her groomed and then waited 4 days to treat her with Frontline and followed their instructions explicitly. She is now on Trifexis and not scratching continuously and black specks are falling off of her. My vet's tech said that they have been getting cases where Frontline has not been working lately. So I bought a 6 month supply of something that does not work!
1,Doesn't work on my English Springer Spaniel,"I'm realizing that some dogs just don't take to Frontline Plus...It's just not working on my Springer. I find a flea or two crawling around on her belly or head within a week of applying the stuff. Seriously, I applied a dose on August 16th, 2011 and found 1 on her head and 1 on her belly on August 21st! And I'm even doubling up with Capstar tablets...UGH!I don't get it..it worked fine on my Golden. But as for my ESS...she is not having the best of luck with Frontline Plus. Poor pup...I've got K9 Advantix II coming in the mail; along with a box of borax powder for the carpet & furniture. So I hope we have better results soon. So annoying. I'm in a constant state of feeling that I have creepy crawly's on me!"
4,"Works ok, not for as long as expected.",I expected the flea protection to last 1 month. It lasts 3 weeks only in warm weather.
4,Frontline Plus,This is a great product and extremely fast shipping. Our dogs have enjoyed it thus far.
1,the product does not work this time,"I used the product before, the product is excellent. But this time, it does not work !! I suspect the product from amazon was either expired (there is no expiration on the package) or it is a counterfeit !!"
2,Did not work for my dog,"Historically, my family has had great success with frontline. I don't want to discourage anyone from trying it because I know it can work (based on the flea population characteristics your dog comes in contact with).We had been using this for 2 months when my dog went to a friends house while we were on vacation. When we got back, he had fleas galore. We put on the next frontline a week early and it did not even phase the fleas on him.We switched to K9 advantix II and the fleas were gone within a couple of days. I know that some fleas are now resistant to Frontline, and that certainly seemed to be the case for the fleas on my dog. I would recommend not buying any more than a 3 month supply at a time in case your dog gets fleas like mine that aren't phased by frontline. If you try Frontline and it doesn't work, k9 advantix II might, as it did for me."
1,Does not work!,This product does not work! Gave it to 2 dogs and a cat for the 3 month period. They all still have fleas! Called the company to take them up on their Guarantee and got the runaround and no Refund! JEREMY the supervisor was no help! Dont waste your money! Find another product! FRONTLINE PLUS DOES NOT WORK ON ALL ANIMALS!
3,"Liked the product in the past, hoping to like it again.","Haven't seen an actual flea since a week after using the product on two dogs, but still getting a few bites here and there. It seems to be better though and I will dose them again next month."
2,something's not right,"the stuff hasn't been working. i keep hearing that you can't trust what you buy online the same way you can if you get it from a vet. i don't know if that's true, but the product box WAS open when my package arrived, which was pretty weird. maybe our fleas have just developed resistance, but whatever the issue, the stuff just isn't working for us like it did in years past."
1,not effective in geogia 09,"i purchased frontline as i have many times before. i applied it as directed, no baths or water contact for at least 4 days each time. the product doesnt work on my two dogs. re applied 1 month later and found the same results; hundreds of fleas. i felt so bad for these two dogs. i called the vet and he recommeded com fortis. its about the same price as frontline. 24 hours later; not one flea. three weeks later; still no fleas. i will not purchase frontline again.roll tide"
3,Works....but only for about a week...& maybe if the fleas aren't immune,"The seller was great! Very fast shipping & easy instructions. But, unfortunately, what originally worked for me about 2 years ago when I first battled fleas now only works for about a week. I did some research as to why this might be happening & it stated that the fleas are now getting immune to particular products. I'm now on the hunt for something else!"
2,Frontline Plus Flea and Tick Control,"I was trying to find a cheaper solution to the Comfortis flea provention pill I was using, but this product was pretty disappointing. My dogs started scratching within two weeks. I'm putting them back on the pill."
2,One Large Dog Dose with a syringe for 3 small dogs,"I was displeased with the product since this is for my daughter's dogs and I believed I was getting the usual dosage in the usual packaging. Instead I received a single large dog dose and instructions on how to apply this to small dogs. This may be less expensive but I did not know that was what I would receive and would have passed it up to get the expected treatment in the right doses for the small dogs. It seems to be 5 doses, not three, which is a good deal, but it is not as promised and it is not being used as the manufacturer intended."
4,Not perfect but beats Hartz.,"The Hartz flea treatment just wasn't doing it for our dogs. While Frontline Plus did not totally eliminate the problem, it seems to be about 98% effective. We're happy and so are the dogs--the fleas, not so much."
2,Very disappointed,"Have not seen fleas, but have pulled multiple live ticks off of my dog beginning ONE WEEK after application. I have applied this product and ones like it many times- user error is not the problem here. I applied it one month to the day after the previous application, and followed the manufacturer's instructions exactly. I am very disappointed because I have two doses of frontline plus left, but I have ordered K9 Advantix II for next month and will be disposing of the remaining frontline. Never again..."
3,NOT 100% Guaranty,"Just got back from the vet yesterday. My dog has lyme disease. So much for front line. We have called in past, but they do nothing. I wonder what other options there are, because this stuff is EXPENSIVE"
5,Dogs,Doctor recommended this product. Found it cheap on Amazon than anywhere else. Need it to help with our three shelies.
5,Frontline Plus,"This is exactly the same product as in pet specialty stores or at the veterinarian's office, only less expensive. We go RVing and camping, so dog is exposed to critters beyond what the back yard has to offer. I've used Frontline for my pets for years and would never consider stopping. Preventive treatment is far less expensive that ridding your home of fleas or ticks. YUCK!"
4,Frontline Plus does its job,The price is great and I believe it's the same as the one that my vet provides.
5,Happy Pups,"I've used this product for years - no fail way to protect your pet(s), not just during the summer, but practically year round with the change in weather and ticks around practically into the winter. Good enough to use on my SharPei's considering their sensitive skin. GREAT PRODUCT!!!!"
5,Frontline Plus (Merial) 45-88 pound dogs - 3 month supply,Product arrived promptly and in good condition. After only one application my dog seems fine - no ticks or fleas evident!Thanks!
4,not worth the wait,waiting over 1 month and still no item since the order date .i would have paid the extra $$$$ if i would have known this was going to take so long to get .
1,Doesn't stop ticks as advertised to,"This product seemed to work for a couple of weeks at controlling fleas on our indoor dog who only goes out for exercise and to potty. However one morning while combing her I noticed something stuck to her skin and much to my surprise it was a tick! I thought it was very strange that the tick would be on her and still be alive considering that Frontline specifically states that it is for controlling both fleas and ticks. Moving forward another month and it happened again - another tick. This time I decided that this product just does not stand up to it's guarantee, nor does it work as advertised. I will not buy again.Have since switched products, and have not experienced the same issue again."
1,tzuthrough,"i am not usually moved by commercials but i thought this time let me try this frontline plus because my vet doctor said i shouldn't use the collars that i had bought for my two shih tzu's because the chemicals on them were too strong for my dogs. i was very angry after i tried frontline because it did not work at all. at least the eight dollar collars worked. i don't like throwing my money away, that was a sacrifice, and believe me i won't do it again.Frontline Plus For Dogs 0-22 Lb, 6 Pk"
1,I won't be buying this product again!,"I have been using frontline in this house since we moved in 13 years ago. I have four dogs and six cats and I never had fleas ~ never. Last year I had fleas for the first time and figured it was just a fluke or something. I treated the whole house and finally got rid of them. This year I even started the Frontline a month earlier and I got fleas again this summer! I don't know if Merial changed the formula of this product or the fleas have evolved to the point where they are immune to it's effects, but either way this product no longer works. I've had several friends mention problems with it as well. I will not be purchasing this product again!"
1,Fleas still there!,This product does not work well at all. I found fleas on my dog continually. I found out later that my vet does not recommend frontline.
1,"NOT made in the US, NOT epa registered or inspected, No guarantee it is not bootleg and bogus product!","DISCOUNT FLEA purchased this product from the UKat a cheaper price. it is NOT epa regulated or inspected! also, i read over and over that the UK versions are hard to detect a phoney product! that is scary! the seller shoul have disclosed that it was uk PRODUCT SO I COULD THEN DECIDE IF I WANTED TO BUY IT! I WOULD not HAVE! CONSIDERING I BOUGHT 6! almost 200 bucks worth of ?????. THE SELLER ALSO SWITCHED BOXES! if you research, the UK box is quite different. YET the seller states that this product has been factory sealed? LIE. if someone (a seller) switches boxes, and repeatedly lies, and does not diclose honest product info??? why should i believe it is a real product! i will not contact them, for the simple fact that these complaints were not made by mistake. they were all made on purpose, and because they think all buyers are stupid!"
4,"effective, most of the time","Our 20 lb, mix, 1 year old puppy likes to play outside and we bring him to the dog park pretty much every day. As a precaution we use Frontline because it's only a matter of time before he gets fleas with so much outdoor exposure and exposure to other dogs. Every couple of weeks he'll start scratching again and we'll notice fleas on him. The timing doesn't really correlate with farther away since the last treatment time so it doesn't appear to be a dose dependent thing. He'll randomly get the fleas and then they aren't really killed or prevented unless we comb them off of him. My guess is that they'd be worse if we didn't use the Frontline, but I'm not going risk finding that out."
1,Frontline did not work,"I have been using Frontline on my dog for 3 years and it has always worked as intended, until now. This time it did absolutely nothing to control the fleas on my dog. At first I thought it was just taking longer than usual to work, but it never did kill a single flea. I asked around and many people have experienced similar problems with Frontline. One person described it as, ""Either the fleas or the dogs are becoming immune to Frontline."" It was suggested to me to try Advantix next...."
1,DIDN'T WORK ON MY DOG,"I tried frontline on my dog since it has so many good reviews, but it didn't work on my dog, because I still see ticks and fleas on my dog even after the third application (and I did exactly what the instructions said). I read somewhere that frontline is not 100% effective because some ticks and fleas have become resistant to it. I'm gonna try a different product..."
1,Be Aware Of The Fake,"I bought Frontline Plus here and NOTHING happened to the fleas. Checking on the Internet I read about COUNTERFEIT Frontline and when I bought Frontline from Petco I could see the difference. Fake ones are in metric, ml, not oz and the packing differs from the original, etc. There's a PDF online from EPA explaining the differences. Just be aware."
5,So glad I bought this!,"I had tried several different products before buying Frontline, and none of them had worked. Frontline is the only thing that killed the fleas completely! The price is also a lot cheaper than I would have paid going to a local vet. Seriously, so happy about this product."
1,FleaZapper sells expired Frontline,"I purchased 2 of Frontline Plus Dog 45-88 Pounds,6 Months, from FleaZapper through Amazon.Com. Please note that my medications were outdated and expired. They,(FleaZapper) attempted to cover the expiration date on one box, but I was able to read through it. I was so disappointed. I gave the company 1 star because it doesn't allow me to give it no stars!!!I will never buy anything from their company again.Respectfully,M.M.Minder"
2,Received Australian Frontline Version - not the USA stuff,The box has a different photo and packaging then that advertised. It is in kg and made for the Australian market by Merial Australia. I bought 2 boxes - both were already opened. Leaves me concerned.
1,Dangerous stuff,"Not knowing any better, I treated my 20 lb. rescue, mixed breed with Frontline Plus for several years. I would stop treatment in the cold, winter months thinking I'd give his system a break. Upon resumption of treatment, my little guy had a seizure -- eyes rolled back, involuntary shaking and tremors -- lasting about 30 seconds to a minute. The second time it happened it dawned on me that it must be a reaction to either Frontline or heartworm treatment. I stopped applying Frontline and there have been no seizures that I'm aware of -- and I'm with the dog 24-7. The Frontline was purchased from the vet and I reported the problem to him. He said he'd had other reports of the product causing problems or simply not working. I would advise anyone to Google flea prevention and read about what we're administering to our pets. There are safe alternatives. We don't need to poison our pets for our convenience."
2,Displeased with order,"""I was displeased with the product since this is for my daughter's dogs and I believed I was getting the usual dosage in the usual packaging. Instead I received a single large dog dose and instructions on how to apply this to small dogs. This may be less expensive but I did not know that was what I would receive and would have passed it up to get the expected treatment in the right doses for the small dogs. It seems to be 5 doses, not three, which is a good deal, but it is not as promised and it is not being used as the manufacturer intended.""Couldnt agree more with this!"
1,Doesn't work at all anymore,"I don't know whether they've changed the recipe or what, but despite application, my dog is still absolutely covered with fleas and is going completely nuts. What a total waste of money!"
1,24 hours later; still covered in fleas,"I really didn't want to use any kind of chemical product on my dog, but after waging a losing battle trying to go all natural, I finally gave up and just used Frontline. I bought my Frontline Plus at the local Agway Feed and Seed store. 48 hours later, my dog is STILL itchy and miserable - and still covered with as many if not more fleas than before!When I called Frontline, I was told that the only REAL Frontline must be purchased through veterinarians and if it was NOT purchased through a vet, it is FAKE! I'm livid that I bought mine from a store that is a large chain and it's probably fake.I would caution anyone buying online - you may be getting a counterfeit product. My dog is miserable and I don't know what to do. I'm afraid to re-treat him with something else since he was just frontlined. He's on Sentinel which seems to be doing nothing to the flea population here either.......:("
2,Deceived,"The item I was sent was not the same as the image advertised. Apparently this is a French or British version of the same product. I don't know if that is the case or not. I would not have ordered this if I had known. I paid for what I thought was the image shown. After receiving the item, I saw that the description did say this, but the seller should use the picture that matches the product."
1,Didn't work,"Unfortunately frontline plus didn't work for our dog,the first two daysafter application fleas decreased but by day 3 our poor pooch was overtakenby flees again.Since the pesticide was in his system we had to wait another 4 weeksand than applied advantage and thank god it worked like magic.Otherwise service was excellent, fast shipping and refund was given."
3,Didn't last long enough,Although the item was at a good price the Frontline Plus didn't last long enough. By 2 weeks we'd start noticing the fleas come back and by week 3 it was with a vengeance.
5,Frontline at a great price/fast shipping,Frontline at a great price/fast shipping. It was offered at a great sale price.
1,Something misleading in 1st ad,"I do a lot of comparing before I buy anything, maybe too much. Something in the ad I read led me to believe this was a years worth of medicine. I even showed my wife that they must have 2 month doses.I thought it was a decent price for a years worth of medicine, it saved me a few dollars over buying the 6 month supply twice.Today I received an auto mailer from amazon with things I may be interested in and it showed a picture of the same thing I bought but for ~1/2 the price. I would not make that mistake and no other Amazon customers would either.This is the 1st review they are getting and Amazon probably will take them off the sellers list.I do not feel Amazon is responsible at all for this.I have never given a negative review before this.If this was a print error from the supplier and the problem is rectified this review will replaced with my normal positive feedback."
2,"Product Fine, Delivery Not-So-Fine",Frontline is great and my dog needed the flea medicine...it's just too bad that Amazon took over two weeks to deliver the product. I could have ordered from another website and gotten it in 3 to 4 days with free shipping.
2,"Hard to open package, difficult to apply","Just got Frontline Plus for dogs, couldn't believe the difficulty opening the package. Don't care for the applicator, could be designed better. My dog has thick underhair, instructions say to apply right down to the skin, was UNABLE to get down that far (Golden Retriever). Can't say how effective it's going to be. Hope didn't waste money, this stuff is really expensive!"
1,Doesn't work anymore,"I hate to give such a negative review to a product that has been great in the past, but after talking with my vet Frontline just doesn't work anymore. Apparently, since it is the oldest of these topical flea and tick preventatives, the bugs have just developed a resistance to it? I went through two doses and the fleas were only getting worse. So, I definitely don't recommend anybody buy this product. I think it still works in some areas, but it certainly did not work for me in the South."
1,Product has not arrived yet and it has been over 30 days.,"I rated this vendor 1 star only because I had no option.Product has not arrived yet and it has been over 30 days. My dogs have a bad case of flea infestation and wanted this product asap but I was informed by the vendor that nothing can be done till after the 30 days period has passed.I need to have a replacement sent to me asap or my money should be credited back to my card. I am very disappointed with this vendor and will not be placing another order with them again.I would have not directly dealt with this vendor but since it was on Amazon I placed an order as I shop regularly with Amazon without a problem.I will not be shopping with Amazon either if this issue is not resolved immediately.Thanks,Shilpa"
1,awful,not happy...... ordered this exactly one month and 1 day ago and still have not received it. I have already rec'd other merchandise from others that I ordered 5 days ago. I think pony express was faster.
4,frontline,Frontline works great for my dogs. It keeps the ticks off and they never get fleas. The applicators work really well but I recommend using gloves. It is a much better product than advantix because it kills the tics whereas adventix just repels them. I would rather have the tics stay on the dog for a while and die rather than having them jump off into the house with the other product.
4,"Effective and best of all, it's waterproof",Frontline plus effectively prevents fleas and other bugs on my dog. I like that it's waterproof so it's still effectively even if I take a bath for my dog within the 30 days.
4,"Great product, I divide it up!","When frontline first came out it was strong enough that 1 dose would last on one of my dogs for over two months, it's not that strong anymore it seems. It does however, work really well. I want to use it specifically because it kills fleas as eggs and adults. It will help with ticks but they are very hard to get rid of. I get this size pkg and divide it up between my 8 dogs who range in size from 22lbs to 90 lbs. My vet gave me a syringe to get the liquid out of each of the vials and advised me on the correct dose for each dog. It really saves money!"
2,Didn't do a good job.,The seller was great with getting the product to me. But the overall product did not get rid of the fleas. I had to go and purchase a different brand.
4,Arrived Quickly,The product speaks for itself. It arrived quickly and is very effective on our little dogs. Would recommend it for your dogs.
2,"Appear to be original Frontline Flus, but it is made by Merial in South Africa","I cannot say the product is not the same as the one made in France for US consumers, but as soon as I opened the envelope and saw only metric system being displayed on the package, I knew its not the same I've been buying here in US. Front of the package was in English, and there was a little insert inside the package in English as well, the rest, I have no clue what language that was, the entire back of the package must be in some language used in South Africa.Again, cannot say the product will dot work the same, yet there was mentioning of South Africa and what part it plays in this product...honestly, would be disappointed if it was made in Africa...and I bought 2 packages as the price was very reasonable.5 stars for the shipping though, we'll packaged A+++ ."
4,THIS IS FRONTLINE COMBO FROM THE UK,"Affirmative. This is the Frontline Combo, distributed in the UK and not approved for use in the US. However the products are identical. Don't be scared."
4,Great Price,Found this to be the best price for this brand name item including the major pet store chains. Skipping applications is not an option where we live. My 87 pound Newfoundland is very happy.
4,This company makes good on their promise.,After contacting the company that I didn't receive my order within the time frame. My order was shipped out that day. I will order again.
5,Great!,It was exactly what I purchased and I'm very happy because it saved us money versus buying elsewhere or at vet!
5,Always count on Frontline + for my dogs,I use Frontline + year-round to help protect my Shelties. Have never had any problems and will continue to use:0)
3,Can't find the expiration date,"I thought Frontline packages had an expiration date but I don't see one on these packages. Also, I thought I was getting a 6-pack, but two 3-packs came instead. I'm sure the company doesn't see a problem with this, but I'd prefer not to have surprises."
5,What I received was as if I bought it at the pet store,I was initially frightful to buy from online but when I received the product I will now continue to save money using this site for my Frontline Plus.
3,Received Quickly,The phone was reasonably priced and was shipped immediately even though I didn't request any special mailing features.
4,It ok,Its a cool phone but the picture needs to show more detail and tell more about it. I didnt want to get it because i didnt even know where i would punch in the phone number so either tell more about it in the description or show more in the picture!
4,If want to buy ONE book - this is the one !,"At last, a Delphi in-depth book without missing subject - everything is there ! It looks like these guys wrote the book AND Delphi 4.0 - there are no more secrets."
5,This book is my favorite novel by Catherine Palmer!,"This book is really exciting & extremely funny. Tillie, a girl longing for a change in her so predictable life, is swept away on an adventure with Greame. At first Tillie isn't sure about Greame but as they continue traveling together in Africa she finds it hard to deal with the fact that he isn't a christian and they can have no future together. Once you open this book you can't put it down and the pages will not stop turning. This book could turn someone who hates reading into someone who loves to!"
5,An Adventure of A Lifetime,"Tilly, a tree planting woman on the african frontier is mysteriously kidnapped and given a gift one day. The Tuareg is after her, and she doesn't know if she can trust the good-looking Graeme who saved/kidnapped her. The tuareg is a african wild tribe of people who only have machetes as an answer to any questions. Tilly learns about Graeme's past life, he was abused by his father, and he in turn is learning to trust God more and more. And Tilly doesn't like the fact that she is liking his kisses more and more. This book is captivating and you simply cannot put it down till the last page has been turned."
5,This book is absolute genius,"And what kind of a stupid reader buys a book because the COVER looks great... why don't you FIND OUT what the book is about before assuming it's medieval history!Rick is one of the most intelligent and insightful people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing... not to mention his incredible wit... This book is representative of a good portion of his awesome talent... it is a highly imaginative, intense, original, intriguing portrayal of history and anyone who doesn't read this book is truly missing out!"
4,Light Hearted Fun Book,"If you are looking for something in the league of ""Name of the Rose"" then this isn't it. Light-hearted, easy to read book about 14th Century Italy - with a plague thrown in. Not a heavy study or serious book - good enough for employing half your brain but worth reading."
1,This book was really dumb,"This book was so stupid! I was fooled into buying it because the cover looked great and I thought it would be more about medieval history than about some dumb, lame story based in the middle ages. Avoid buying it if you can."
3,Where are the recipes?,"Sure, these pictures may be cute, but where's the useful instructions on dressing and preparing new and innovative cavy dishes the whole family will love? Seems like a wasted opportunity to promote the tastiness and gentle environmental impact of a diet high in these cute little squeakers."
5,Great Garlic Keeper!!!,"I got this and the onion keeper for christmas and i love them both!!! They are roomy enough, keep my garlic and onions fresh and are very attractive. I am very very pleased. i must admit, my kitchen smells a little like garlic, but i live in a basque household, and we love garlic, so it's all good :) It isn't bad, just slight, but probably because my garlic has been in there 2 weeks. I checked it and it is still firm, no sprouts, and no mold. Everyone who uses garlic or onions should get these keepers. :) happy customer!!!"
1,Disappointed!,"The price obviously was fairly convincing, however, upon receipt, the display surface looked as though it were a very used product. It lead us to be believe that maybe we had received a refurbished unit. Additionally, the picture was distorted over half of the viewing area to the point where once you try to adust it, it equally distorts the other half of the picture. I also expected a much brighter picture with Plasma as I've seen with other units I've seen in stores, however, even with it brightness maxed out, it was only 50% as bright as those on display in stores. Tech support was of very little help to us to solve any of the problems we exprienced. However, the begged and pleaded with us not to return it as it that's all they've been dealing with-obviously a trend with this company. There was just too many serious issues with this product to accept and it has since been returned. We purchased a 30inch LCD-TV which draws a lot less power and has a much brighter picture."
1,Dying battery....,Ordered this and it is not holding a charge. Something wrong or it is an older used one? What do I do to get it replaced with a new battery?
4,Moto W490 battery,"Battery for my Moto W490 arrived very quickly, 3 days. Appeared new. Lasts, on average, 2 to 3 days before charging."
4,battery,OK FOR NOW I WILL SEE IN A FEW MONTHS FROM NOW BUT THE PRICE WAS RIGHT GET BACK IN 6 MONTHS OK BUY FOR NOW.
5,"Looks like new, functions like new.","The battery arrived pretty quick, we charged it fully before we put it to use and it works like new. (Battery came sealed)"
5,It's a Battery...,"Well it's kinda hard to review a product that just does exactly what it's supposed to, but here we go: It arrived fully charged and has worked perfectly since installation. The fact that the shipping was twice as much as the battery itself was not a problem because the whole thing was still only about $6 (US). My phone is about 4 years old and I had to charge it after just a couple of calls - now I can go 5 days or more without getting near a charger. Feels like a brand new phone."
1,Battery is junk,"the battery is cheap, but it only charged for about 3 hrs. of use. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,As advertised,"Product arrive in about a week in good condition, before this my previous battery would need recharging after about an hour and was getting progressively worse (would randomly shut off, drop calls etc.), this solved all that and at a VERY reasonable price. Kudos to the sellers for sending a non-defective product (that happens with other stores from time to time), I fully recommend shopping with them and will most likely be doing again in the future. One note, the previous batteries that I had lasted about 2 years, and thats with heavy use so these li-io around half bad either way."
1,"Good Price, Poor Quality","I purchased this battery based on price. I guess you get what you pay for. When I received the battery, I promptly charged it for the required time, then put it in my phone with great expectations and got nothing, nada, zilch! Upon further inspection I noticed that the battery terminals were improperly manufactured which prevented the battery from working in my phone.Sigh, good thing Amazon promptly refunded my money."
4,Motorola BT50,I have had this battery for over a month. So far this battery has held a longer charge than the original battery (Original battery came with the Motorola K1m phone). The price for this battery is really a deal. I am very pleased so far.
5,Exactly what I expected,"We received this battery very quickly and smoothly. The price was reasonable, and it worked for our phones as promised."
4,Ok,Lithium Ion batteries do have a shelf life. This one will still hold a charge for about 2 days of moderate use.
3,Decent,"working well till now. Chinese made, like the original, but works much longer. I do suspect though, that this won't also be able to support a heavy usage."
1,Can it hold a charge?,"I'm recharging this battery more that the one I replaced! Yes, I did charge it up initially for the recommended 15 hours."
1,Bad Experience,"I purchased this item and requested standard shipping, but I recieved expedited shipping. This was not what I asked for. It cost 9 dollars more. Be aware of this merchant, they will not resolve your problems. Do not use this merchant."
4,Razr battery,"This battery arrived in good time from the seller. It was ordered to replace my previous one that came with my phone, as that one went dead. So far, so good. It has worked like a charm, and it was soooooo cheap!! I would defnitely order another one just as back up. Thank you amazon!! You're the best!"
5,"great product, great price, fast shipping","Works perfectly, is an authentic Motorola product, and arrived quickly. What more is there to say?"
1,Defective Cell Phone Battery,"While the service from Amazon was as good as usual, the replacement battery I purchased for my Motorola cell phone (V195) from the supplier Bargaincell is useless. It doesn't hold a charge for more than one day even though the phone is used infrequently. The cost of returning it and paying for shipment isn't worth it. Amazon should check Bargaincell for its record on defective merchandise.M. MielkeGeorgia"
1,Dead on arrival,Bad News: After receiving this cell phone battery it would not take a charge.Good News: This vendor was available for my complaint and replaced the defecitve battery immediately. Second battery took a charge and is working fine.
2,The battery is too thick,"The battery works, However, it is too thick. Once I put it in my cell, the cover keeps falling off."
1,bad battery,the battery i received will not take a charge it lasted 1 day. the battery must be defective.
3,Value for Price,"Within a week of buying the battery, it began to run down quickly, but given the price I paid for it, it represents decent value."
1,Not a new battery as advertised!,This battery was advertised as a new battery. It most definitely was not new and does not hold a charge any better than the one that we were replacing. Not happy at all with this purchase.
4,Works well,The battery I ordered needed to be charged and since then it has worked like a new battery! Maybe I got lucky?
1,battery dies,"Battery must have been very old, have had it only 2 months, and it won't hold a charge. Get what you pay for I guess."
1,Motorola K1m Li-Ion Standard Battery. BT 50,"I bought a brand new battery and when I put in my cell phone, it only lasted for 1/2 hour ( same as my old battery)."
1,Well it works...sorta,"The battery worked correct, but still noticed that the phone 'low battery' alert went off almost the same amount of time my old one did. Since it was so inexpensive, I did not bother to try and return it. The battery is still working but goes low within 6 hours of removing the charger at full charge.I will be buying another from a different seller."
1,POOR,I ordered a new cell phone battery for my phone in the hopes that it would last longer then the old one and it did not.
4,Good buy,The product worked fine. Delivery was quick. Everything went as described. I would purchase from this vendor again
3,Battery not as good as I hoped,"I purchased this battery because my original batter would not hold a charge for even one day. Maybe 1 hour of talk time. Unfortunaletly, this new battery does not seem to be any better."
4,Motorola battery,Received what i was as expecting. Arrived quickly. Works as new in phone . Price was very reasonable. No problems with battery
1,Battery damaged phone,"I bought this battery for my Motorola phone. When I installed the battery in the phone, the phone got very warm and burned the screen out. Unfortunately, the battery damaged my phone. I believe I received a damaged battery but when trying to contact company I bought it from, they said they are not responsible for the outcome of the product. Now i am stuck with a defected battery and a defective cell phone due to a defected battery. I rate this product and selling store at the very low. I understand sometimes product can be defective but I don't understand why the company did not take ownership of the problem when it was there product the one that aggravated the situation."
1,worthless battery,"This battery was worthless - didn't hold a charge, and was useless. I will never buy from them again."
2,NOT MUCH BETTER THAN THE OLD BATTERY,Replaced my old battery with this new??? one and it is not much better than the old one it needs to be recharged every three days and my cell phone is only used two or three times a day.
2,Pretty much what I replaced,"The only reason I bought this product was to replace the battery in my phone that doesn't last very long. This battery does not work like new and doesn't last much longer than the one I replaced. I know it's cheap, but it was still kind of a waste of money."
3,Does the job..,you get what you pay for .. the battery is years old .. but works.The shipment time was awful from the seller. They lost my shipment and had to resendthe order .. it arrived me after more than 20 days of waiting..
5,OMG!!,I can't believe that I was able to get a new battery for this price!! I would buy it again and again!
3,Not bad for $3.42.,"This battery isn't the greatest but for $3.42 it's better than what I had. My old battery was only lasting about 5 minutes...no I'm not kidding, and this one gives me about 1 1/2-2 hours of talk time so can't complain at all considering the price."
1,Terrible seller!,"Battery is used, not as described as original. When I asked for a replacement, the seller sent to me two weeks later and it's a worse one. Never, never buy anything from this seller."
4,Gift,This battery was for my daughter's phone and it worked. She can now make calls and the battery last much longer
2,Cell phone batteries,"Received these and they held a charge for a very short time. Not happy with them at all, would not re-order."
1,rip-off,"this purchase was a complete ripoff.i am not even sure whether this ""new"" battery was any better than my old one!!what a shame!!"
3,Not exactly new,"My phone had a 6-7 day battery life when it was new, a year and a half ago. It recently has been down to 2 days. I got this battery to be like new again, but it has about a 1 day life. There were scratches on the case, but it did fit and it did work, I just don't know if I got a battery that was as bad as the original or if it is the phone. Probably not worth spending more money to find out. So if you are in the same situation, pay the extra $10 (or whatever it is) and get a new battery instead of a maybe new."
4,Motorola Li-ion battery,"Works pretty well, not really long life though. I like that I don't have to let it run down all the way to charge it(no memory effect). I would buy another, but always keep a spare-james"
1,"low price, old battery","Does not hold a charge. Charged my phone all night and after talking on the phone a few minutes, my phone was completely dead. I ordered a new battery, not used."
1,obvioiusly NOT a new battery,I purchased this battery because the one I had was losing its charge every time I placed a call. The specs on this battery I purchased stated that it was new. This battery won't even last through half a day unless I do not use my phone at all.I am very disappointed.
3,Battery LIfe,Battery matches orig equip specs. I have charged it but it doesn't seem to hold up very long. With just waiting and no actual talking it seems to run down in only about 6 hours.. Going to give it a little more time-- only had it few days -- maybe needs more charge time though the phone indicated charge complete.-- Now I question the phone itself.
2,Useless,I purchased this battery because my original was in need of constant charging - this was no better. The phone got very hot and didn't hold the charge. Waste of money.
5,PLEASED,Read other reviews and decided to give this battery a try. I was very pleased with the quality. For the price it holds a good charge. I am glad I gave it a try.
3,"Works, but not like a new one.","That is all I want to say, but these reviews require me to say more. I don't think more is necessary!"
1,"After 6 months, I must charge my phone daily","The battery started off great, but quickly died. My original battery lasted a year before fading, but this one started to fade within 3 months."
1,what is it called when you sell a used item as new?,"This battery was clearly previously used. Although shipping was fast (all shipping is fast in this economy) the battery arrived in a ziploc bag with some sort of cleaning solution smeared over the surface. The contacts looked as worn as those on the battery I replaced. To be fair, at about 2 days with no talk time, or 60 minutes talk time, this battery does hold a charge longer than my old battery, but nowhere near when my battery was new.I suspect there is a problem between Amazon and the sellers community, because the item is advertised by Amazon as condition='new' but nowhere on the product description does it advertise being a new battery. If this site wasn't so misleading ""up to 210 hours talk time"", I would have been happier with the low price, but now I consider it a major waste of my time, and I just feel cheated."
2,old batteries,"the batteries that they sent me was older than the one i had in my phone, and would not hold a charge. they did try to fix the problem by sending me replacements (3 total) and the last one was a little better that the one that was in my phone."
2,Not a long-term solution,"This battery started losing its charge after a matter of months, and after dragging it out, find ourselves looking for a new battery almost a year since purchase. Currently, it doesn't hold a charge for the length of one phone call."
1,Worst Experience,The batteries can't even last for 1 day. My old one has better life than the new ones.The worst purchase that I had ever made.
1,If I didn't know better...,"... I'd think my replacement BT50 was the same battery as the 1-yr-8-mo battery old it replaced. It's as if it's a used battery. It loses charge bars as quickly as the former heavily used one. I'm on the phone a lot, so the original factory battery was amazingly robust, and only pooped out in the past 4 weeks. I'll keep it because shipping cost cancels the advantage (Alaska), and buy a new one from Best Buy where--if it's also a dud--I can swap it out. Lesson learned. Otherwise, I purchase A LOT of stuff on Amazon and have no complaints. In fact, in my 10 years of dealings, I've returned only one item, and the matter was promptly handled, satisfactorily."
2,Disappointed,"This was a poor choice for purchase. Received the battery and worked for only 8 days - couldn't recharge. In the end, the shipping cost more that the battery. Will be more careful in choice next time."
2,"Low price, old battery","These batteries are sold at bargain-basement prices for a reason. Li-ion batteries degenerate with age and begin to lose their ability to fully charge after a year. The ones we received were manufactured 13 months ago, so they will have the same problems as the year-old batteries we'd bought them to replace. If you need a cheap battery fast, fine, but don't count on these as a reliable, long-term solution."
4,"A little smaller, but it works","The battery is a little smaller than the original one, but I have found I have had better battery life with this battery. Cheap and better than the original.I have a MOTOKRZR phone"
2,Cell phone battery,Not up to par.Only holds a charge about half as long as original battery that came with phone. Probably would not purchase this one again.
4,Works great.,"I purchased this battery to replace my old one because I had to recharge it every day and it died with just one phone call, this one, doesn't look new, but works really well, I charge it and I can use it for a considerable time before it runs out of power, and the price is really good too."
1,bad review,"I ordered a battery for my cell phone, but still have to charge it all day,not good battery at all."
1,I have not received product!!! AND NOT HAPPY.,I have not received product!!! AND NOT HAPPY.AND THE REASON I PICK 1STAR IS BECAUSE WILL NOT LET ME OUT. you have the worst serv EVER!
3,"Great price, but for a reason.","Compared to $40, $3.86 for a new battery was a bargain. I was disappointed however, when the ""new"" battery I received looked like it had already been used. It's in reasonably good shape, though. My old battery was holding a charge for only a few hours and swelling up, this one isn't. So.... I'll give it 3 stars for being in good working condition at a low price, and the -2 stars for NOT being new as it was advertised."
2,cell phone battery,"I received the battery quickly. But the battery does not perform like a new battery. It doesn't hold the charge as long as I expected it to. After charging all night, the charge lasts for approximately 9 hours."
2,Not much charge,"Though this battery is startlingly inexpensive (and therefore probably still worth the price, just barely), mine doesn't hold much of a charge. I charged it at least 24 hours (and maybe more like 36) when I first got it, but still I don't think it gives more than an hour of talk time. Also, it's hard to gauge how much charge is left, because (unlike my original battery) the first two or three bars on the indicator disappear far more quickly than the fourth."
1,No title,I bought 2 Bt150 batteries a few weeks ago. Since then one has already went bad on me and I am now using the second one. The battery started out working fine. Now it won't hold a charge.
3,it's a battery,"It's a battery. It fits my phone, it takes a charge, it has a reasonable life between charges. I'll let you know in a year or so how its lifespan is if I still have this phone."
5,Uniquely useful spiritual classic,"This is a book to pray with. A thousand short points,some of which leap out at you -- but not always the sameones -- every time you open it. There is no other work(other then the author's own Furrow and Forge) that providessuch useful stimuli for conversation with God, without itselfbecoming a distraction from prayer.NOT Spirituality Lite."
5,Powerful,"St. Josemaria Escriva's 'The Way"" was very influential. Obviously, some people will instantly jump to the conclusion that Opus Dei is a cult and that 'The Way' is its tool. If one looks past the lies that have been stirred up in the past years, the truth can be found. In the right mindset, 'The Way' is great advice on how to live a better life."
5,MODERNIZE,"The Way (Camino) is a great book. One to have where ever you go and read some of it every day.""Get it in Kindle format""It would be great to be able to take it along, when you travel, are in a hospital, waiting for a doctors appointment, etc., in your kindle.Enrique Azcarraga"
4,Pearls of wisdom for the spiritual,"After The DaVinci code, Opus Dei has gotten a terrible reputation, undeserved. This book is enlightening to anyone of any christian and even non christian denomination. It addresses with simple ideas all the struggle of improving ones self to grow spiritually."
2,3Com Older Adapter,This was the wrong network adapter for our site. We were lucky to be able to return to the vendor and exchange for the right ones.
2,Smelly Lotion,"The product didn't smell as good as I thought it would. Also after reading the fine print on it: may cause sexual dysfunction and contains illegal cancerous ingredients for the state of California, i didn't put that stuff on my head again."
5,The Keltiad,"I first read The Copper Crown, The Throne of Scone and The Silver Branch in the late 80's early 90's. I can not count the number of times I have read them. (I am in fact in process of reading them now...and still have a hard time putting them down) I have, had to replace the entire series at least 3 times....due to worn bindings or simply because I made the mistake of lending them out and not getting them back. I have also read every other Keltiad book written by Dame Patricia. The books are rich, full of a sense of history, legend and flow like nothing else I've ever read. I have been waiting for more, only to read somewhere online that there may never be more and that saddens me. Gwydion's story should be told. :-(These are truly among the best Sci-fi/fantasy books ever written."
4,Off to a great start,"I first read The Copper Crown several years ago and was hooked; I have since read all of the other Keltiad books. I am particularly fond of books in series, and the Keltiad, like many other series, shows the developing talents of the author as she goes along. The Copper Crown was a great read, very detailed characters, was clearly thought out society in terms of politics, religion, etc., but as you read further books in the series you clearly see the author's talents getting stronger and better. I would suggest that you should read The Copper Crown and The Throne of Scone before The Silver Branch as I believe The Silver Branch is intended to be a flashback."
3,Deserved better characters,"I'll admit, the very concept of this book had me hooked from the start. The idea of Celts in space and an intergalatic power struggle sounded like something that would make for a good read. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there.The novel's main flaw is that almost all its characters are made of cardboard; the Good Kelts vs. Nasty Imperials. Most of the Kelts (and other characters) are so insufferably perfect in almost every way that one can hardly tell they're human at all. This in the end means that its hard to at all identify with them or get swept up by their various trials and triumphs, and that is a fatal flaw in any story. There are some scenes that hint that there is a possibility of much, much more to these characters, but they are far too few. I have not read the sequel yet, and can only hope that the characters' depictions improve as the story goes on. However, this novel itself is average at best."
5,One of Adams' Finest,A totally excellant Dilbert Book. The strips are hillarious and this book brings together a good size collection of them. You can read it over and over again and it will be as funny as the first time. A must-have for any Dilbert fan and makes a great gift for those just getting started with Dilbert. Bravo Scott!
4,No Nonsense Aikido,"This is an outstanding book. It is very clearly written. Section One gives clear and useful insights into power. Section Two provides an interesting perspective on applications of power.The question and answer format becomes tedious by the end. However, the content starts out strongly and continues until the last sentence.An important additon to any serious student's library."
1,Verbose,"I was very disappointed with this book. It just goes on and on talking in abstract terms. There are no pictures or diagrams, just a lot of mystical stuff disguised in technical terms. Maybe somebody with advanced experience could sense what these guys were talking about, but I couldn't."
3,Good for beginner researcher,all too brief but to the point. much of the same complaints againstAdventism as other books. This is a good book for those who first encounter Adventism and wish to explore the problems others have encountered.
3,Not biblical,Sounded angry and wanted readers to go to his church instead of focusing on true beliefs of SDA. I am a SDA and what was written in this book just isnt true.
1,piece of junk,"I bought the 9700 all-in-wonder for a computer I built. I chose the all-in-wonder to record TV, too bad it never works like it should. I have installed every version of the software and drivers available from ATI and it will try and record TV but then it freezes. Keep in mind it records TV great if I am sitting in front of it watching it.If you are looking for a product that will waste your time and cause you a great deal of frustration then ATI has a product for you. If you are looking for a product that will work as advertised then ATI is not the maker of choice."
2,Similar Problem with A7N8X Deluxe,"Hi all,I too bought this product with the intention of using the PVR capabilities among other things, but for some reason, the nForce motherboard does not like the sound input from the TV tuner. It doesn't seem to matter what driver revision is used or installation sequence, but things just don't work between these systems. Makes you wonder whether one company or the other has a hidden agenda..."
2,not really Ultravation product,"I bought this filter, based on the advertising statement, thinking it was a real Ultravation-branded product. However, the filter that arrived was completely unmarked as to source. The filter paper is entirely white, not mustard color on one side as shown in the advert (my OEM filter was also mustard color on one side). Thus, I have no idea if this filter is a knock-off or genuine."
2,Not Ultravation filters.,"I ordered these thinking that they were going to be Ultravation brand filters and they are not. They seem to be ok, but do not order this thinking that you will receive an Ultravation product."
2,very disappointed,"I don't have many needs for a laser level, just your basic DIY projects and the occasional picture hanging, but this device couldn't even handle that. It projects a line of varying width (much thicker in the middle than on the sides) which makes it difficult to level anything except when the level is placed extremely far away in order to minimize the line distortion. The two beam heads and magneticly atatchable and thus hard to adjust in small increments. The included tripod is of poor quality as well. It's difficult to adjust and tends to come undone in the middle of a job, frustrating to say the least. This product isn't a good buy for anyone except those on the tightest of budgets."
3,Ok for the price.,"I simply cannot complain about paying $10 for this product. As a professional handyman it is almost usless due to its lack of precision. The problem is mainly due to the lens attachments. Without the attachments, the tool is somewhat useful in low light and mounted on a tripod for lining up fence posts and taking rough elevations. I think my wife will find it useful for hanging pictues, so long as the plumb/level lens is calibrated to a known referece (existing wall and ceiling corners). The vials on the attachments are totally out of calibratin with the lens. If I had paid twice as much for the product, I would have retuned it as defective."
1,Waste of money,"It was cheap buy. But a waste of money. Its big, heavy, hard to level, the lens its put on with magnets."
3,Acceptable,"Since this is not a particularly expensive product it is acceptable. The right angle adapter doesn't project a line on the surface, it only puts a dot on the far wall so it is not really useful."
5,A very good product,"I use this all the time when our Church volunteers build wheelchair ramps for elderly and disabled people in our community. It does exactly as advertized . It is small, light and easy to handle. The leveling adjustments are very handy and it works well, even in bright sunlight. I would recommend it to everyone who needs a laser level."
1,Pure JUNK,I got a GPX CD player for Christmas and it broke the 2nd time I used. TARGET wouldn't exchange it becuase I didn't have a receipt (It was a dang Christmas present!) I called GPX and they wanted me to ship the player back to them which cost $10 and mail them a check for $15. So it would cost me another $25 to replace it. GPX makes lousy products. You would have to be a FOOL to buy this product.
3,Liebman in full flight but dvd quality is poor,The DVD is a video recording of a workshop that David Liebman gave at the Jamey Aebersold Summer Camp. The first disc is in a lecture theatre where David Liebman moves about sometimes using the microphone and at other times not using it. The person that video taped the event at times did not move the camera to follow David Liebman as he spoke and at times Liebman disappears out of the frame continuing his lecture. At another point he writes on the chalkboard but yet again the video does not capture what he writes. There are some useful hints about playing from basic info on posture and technique to expressive techiques such as articulation and vibrato. Not a great deal of playing on the dvds but what is there shows Liebman quite well. This in no means is a professionally recorded DVD. It is effectively a video released on DVD of two sessions at a music workshop. The video is a bit jumpy at times but if you can overcome this the message is a good one.
