4,Great Product,I had a real laugh learning this product. I think it's a real must have for any research. It really helps out.
1,Feist's Brass Age (He's got a lot of brass putting his name on it),"Feist has written some excellent books, creative, complex, and interesting. ""Faerie"" and the ""Magician"" duology come to mind. This isn't one of them. This is a shallow, cartoonish coming-of-age/revenge plot that exhibits the worst excesses of fantasy today. Feist got comfortable here in Midkemia and hasn't done much that's worthwhile since then. If you want to learn about fantasy, find something that is original rather than a pastiche of every easy cliche the author has run into. BTW, 1 star for this was high. There should be a rating that says ""Give me my money back."""
4,"Talon of the Silver Hawk (Conclave of Shadows, Book 1)","Although not as good (or even close) to the classic Magicain, Feist yet again secures his position as one of the best fantasy writers around with this first book in his new series.Our young hero, Talon of the Silver Hwak, returns to his village to find his family being murdered and his home being burned. He survives the massacre and his the last of his people. From here on Talon knows that his life is in the hands of the man who saved him as is custom with his people, he owes him the life-debt. Talon has now a new life and in this life he is trained to be a dangerous man, for his carers feels he has something special. A young boy from the mountains soon becomes a man with abilties beyond his thought in his old life.Talon of the Silver Hawk is very well written with fantastic clarity from Feist, he a once again justified himself as one of the best. This book is a excellent read and the series has all the making of a great collection."
5,Talon of the Silver Hawk,"I just couldn't put it down. It's a well thought out, fast moving plot that kept me going to the last page."
4,"Talon of the Silver Hawk (Conclave of Shadows, Book 1)","I have read all of Mr. Feist's works. I got a little tired of him for a while, I felt like I was reading a guide book to a video game. The Conclave of Shadow series seems to be back on track with what I have come to expect from him.If you have read his other works, this continues on a few generations after his last series. If you haven't read all his other stuff, you can pick this up and not be lost. Although there are references to back stories, nothing is critical to plot (yet)."
2,Read one of his other books,"Feist has written some good books, this isn't one of them. In the intro he writes ""thanks to my editors who watched me burn the candle at both ends to get this finished and kept me upright and moving forward."" It reads like it was written just to get it get it done, there is little art or magic, just prose and a plod to the finish. If the series interests you, read the synopsis in some of the reviews and skip to book two. I promise you won't miss much."
4,A very nice read.,"It's probably not as good as the Magician series, but then that would be hard to beat. However, I like Feist doing what he does best-- coming of age stories featuring talented young men in difficult situations. In the books that I've enjoyed the most in Midkemia, there's been a character like Talon.It's a little bit thin, and I'll reserve final judgement until I've seen where the larger series goes (I didn't really like the plot turn at the end of the book), but it was surely satisfying to read on a cold autumn day."
4,Good start for the new series,"Raymond Feist began his new saga with this book and did it well, I believe. With new and interesting characters, many adventures and powerful magic, it is a promise to something grand."
2,A repeat in different clothes,"Is there anyone else who is tired of Raymond Feist's repeating of old plots and styles in new incarnations? The young-man- coming-of-age saga is getting to be grating, especially when one looks back to his earlier efforts and see that he is getting to repeat himself ad nauseum. It is my cross to bear that I discovered Feist when no one I knew had heard of him, and now that he is commercial, his work no longer appeals to me. But at least it is not as embarrassing as Krondor."
3,"Lacks drama, character","Feist fans will want to read this book if only to see how Midkemia has rebuilt after the Serpentwar. However, the main character is quite hollow compared to the flamboyant and vibrant characters from previous stories. Conveniently, Talon is excels at everything. This makes his character unintersting to me. His mentors are much more intriguing than he is, but glimpses of their characters are fleeting."
3,Dry and Contrived !,"Besides an interesting plot and intriguing characters, a great fantasy must have intensity, emotions and depth. Sadly these are missing in Talon of the Silver Hawk. The beginning is fine but after a quarter through the book, I know Feist is not my type of writer. His style lacks sensitivity in his characters.I could not identify with the protagonist and do not really care what happen to him next. This story is just one of the many average and typical fantasies churned out today and definitely not for us who wish our fantasy to have a soul. I would have given 2 stars but well...the plot of the story does seem promising at first glance."
4,Another great heroes journey.,"Talwin Hawkins is a great new character to carry the ongoing saga of Midkemia's struggle between good an evil forward. One of the strengths of this, the first book in a new series by master storyteller Raymond E Feist, is that you can jump strtaight into this book without having read the multitude of previous novels set in the world of Midkemia. Of course, if you have read all the books there are connections and references to past events which are satisfying, however this story does stand on it's own and can be read as such. If this is the case for you I am more than certain you will enjoy this book so much that you will want to search out the first book Magician and gobble up every delightful morsel of Raymond's genius."
3,OK,"Again, the Conclave of Shadows is weak when compared to Feist's other novels. Though it is a tolerable read, I recommend buying a used copy."
3,A decent radio at a good price...,"For the price, this radio is pretty full featured. At the price of a cheap one-channel radio, you get all 14 channels, plus all 38 CSTSS codes.It performs well, has reasonable range, and good audio quality.My only problem is that it eats batteries. A set of 3 AAA's will only last about 4-5 hours of ontime."
3,Drains batteries while turned off,"I left it sitting on the shelf for a few months w/ batteries inside. When I went to use it, it had drained the batteries. Battery life also seems too short. I'd suggest getting FRS radios that take AA batteries even though they are somewhat larger.It is clear and loud and has decent range (not sure what other folks are used to, especially the guy who tested 210 radios but didn't post what the top 3 were from his results). It also has the key features (lots of channels and subcode), so it's a relatively good deal for FRS radios."
5,An Outstanding Masterpiece!,"This book is one of the best I've ever read. It is thorough and complete, with beautiful illustrations which both bring the text alive and encourage the reader to learn more. I learned so much from reading it. It increased the span of my vocabulary incredibly. I have a much stronger understanding of homophones and have corrected my simple mistakes I once overlooked. It has encouraged me to dig deeper into the world of comprehension. This book is a masterpiece which should have a special place on everyone's bookshelf."
2,just ok,"This book contains a lot of unusual and obscure words that aren't very useful. It is oriented to middle school age and above, although the illustrations might deter an older audience. I don't recommend for elementary age children. I found other books on the topic to be better."
1,Sucked!,They said it is Universal and it didn't fit my 1995 Honda Del Sol. Lame. So I just gave it away instead of dealing with it. More lame.
5,Love it!,"I have loved the book Sheep Out Eat by Nancy Shaw since I was little and my Mom read it to me, so a few years ago when I found this book in a store I was very exicited. This book is cute and funny and even though I am 14 I still love to read it!"
3,Sheep on a ship,"Although the book is darling and my Granddaughter loves it, it didn't down load as well as the others and every page is doubled and the text is tripled."
2,"Way too expensive, yet incomplete","$100 for a book about implementing elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) that doesn't discuss point counting algorithms!? The book is a hodgepodge: the first chapter talks about general crypto algorithms, the second discusses finite fields, and only the third chapter is really about elliptic-curve implementation. (The 4th chapter is about crypto protocols in general, not really specific to ECC; the last chapter is about general implementation issues but, again, not about ECC specifically.) The book would be reasonable at 1/3 the price. At this price, do yourself a favor and buy a different book."
3,Good idea badly excuted!!,"The good:1) touches on thing other books seems to ignore.2) will not overwhelm you with the mathThe bad/not so good:1) the authors writing style is awful:a) they don't care about the ""logical"" line of thought. they lead the reader somewhere then suddenly abandoned to wander what just happened and why.b) they don't know when to start a new line. by cramming too much information in a paragraph sometimes combined with math forces the reader to go back and forth multiple times to make sure you didn't miss anything.2) chapters don't stand on their own.3) lack of figure to help convey the message in certain locations."
5,A very nice introduction to the field,"This book is a must have if you are interested in implementing elliptic curve cryptography. It does not have any of the juicy ellpitic curve mathematics, but that is okay as this book is directed towards engineers and others who want to learn about how elliptic curve cryptosystems are being deployed."
1,Not delivered with everything,"Well, first of all, it took forever for the delivery. Then the book doesn't come with the CD! I'm a visual learner and I was hoping the book came with everything because the Ad didn't say it was being delivered without the CD. In other words, someone lost the CD and sold the book without it. That should have been advertised! See below:""The accompanying CD features PrepLogic(tm) Practice Tests, Preview Edition. This product includes one complete PrepLogic Practice Test with approximately the same number of questions found on the actual vendor exam. Each question contains full, detailed explanations of the correct and incorrect answers. The engine offers two study modes, Practice Test and Flash Review, full exam customization, and a detailed score report.""I'm glad I didn't lose that much moey but in this economy, good money is good money."
3,A good start for 26 bucks,"This book provides a real good start with less than 500 pages. But you will never pass the test just from the material in this book. Taking the advice of others before me, I obtained all the info I needed from this book, plus the Windows XP resource kit (available free online or in paperback) and ""Changes to Functionality in Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2"" (Also an online microsoft resource)."
5,Great Book But Not Enough Alone,This book was excellent as sort of a last week read quick and pick up the things that you forgot sort of thing. This book by no means covers every detail that you will need to know. I purchased this in a combo pack with the extra prep-logic questions which I found to be great. I think the key to any of these Microsoft Tests is a little bit of studying and of course some hands on work with their products. Passed with an 873.
5,Mista CooI Is So Funky It Sounds Live!!!,"I play in an 80's style funk currently and the younger crowds stand in awe at what can be done w/o using turntables, drum machines and computers; just regular drums, a guitar, a bass, some keyboards and a singer. The track 'Mista Cool' is worth the price of this CD alone as it sounds how 80's funk bands played live as opposed to their recorded material much of which was slicked up for radio in attempt to 'cross-over'. !!!Not This Track!!! This track is so funky I use it to pump myself for our shows! !!!Get This CD even just for this track!!! !!!It's a classic!!!"
4,99.9% perfect.,"the only problem with this cd is that the opening to ""ride -o-rocket"" rocket countdown -blastoff were broken into two separate tracks with a pause in between .on the original vinyl they ran into each other otherwise ,its great.Also the liner notes are excellent."
4,Great Album: But Why So Much?,"This Was The Brothers Johnson At Their Artistic Peak, As Far As I'm Concern, But Why Are They Asking $72-$199 For This CD? I May Be A Fan, But I'm No Fool!"
5,Perfect Security System Addition at a Great Price,"Let me start by acknowledging Amazon for providing such a deal on the sensor. The manufacturer sells this sensor at $90. I was able to add three additional sensors (radar, tilt, glass) to my system for less than the price of one.After installing the sensor, I attempted to jack up the vehicle. It sounded the full alarm before a wheel lifted from the ground. Great addition to my Python 872 security system."
3,Too Sensitive?!,Works great. Only problem is that I had to put in a toggle switch to bypass when I park at work. something would trigger the sensor about 30 seconds after arming the alarm. The toggle fixed the problem.
5,"In New York, this add-on is a Definite Asset to your alarm!","I think that every single vehicle should have an item like this installed in it. In Queens, New York, the thieves love to slightly jack up the front end of your car in the middle of the night and steal both of your front rims. A typical car alarm isn't going to go off if the vehicle is jacked up in this manner. But with this tilt sensor, you can be sure your alarm will be blaring.I checked all over the internet and could not find this product cheaper than I did on Amazon. You really can't beat the price for what this item is intended for. I cannot fathom my Mustang not having a tilt sensor. I would certainly recommend this product to everyone out there with a nice car with expensive rims and tires."
5,great talent,This dvd was a lovely yet inexpensive gift for friends. The song titles list was impressive and so was the footage.
5,A japanese song is played in this.,"In the first episode:It seems Amy thinks she studies too much and she becomes a target.In the second episode:Sailor Moon and Sailor Uranus coorparate to save Sailor Neptune.In the third episode:Chad thinks Raye doesn't like her, and he... leaves!!!Do you think he'll come back? Find out and buy this!!!"
4,Moshi moshi!,"This is the third S video. I liked all the episodes, but I kinda have a bias against Ami...I liked the second ep best, where Sailormoon gets chained to Sailoruranus and they have to work out their differences...!THE END!"
3,Not bad for America,"First of all, this was an okay movie. I gave it three stars because they still played the Japanese song in the last episode. I'm a subbie, believe me!"
5,Better than ever,"If you want to know how to cook something, this is the place to start. It literally has it all, from discussions of food types, utensils, techniques, and individual ingredients, as well as recipes for almost everything."
2,"""Side by Side and not too fast""","Someone gave me ""Too Far Gone"", which introduced me to Alexa Keene. And I was disappointed in ""Side by Side"". Book is confusing and not particularly logical. It is obvious that the Alexa Keen character was written by a White person. The Store owning couple at the end of the book were a redeeming feature, but too little and too late, for my taste."
3,funk lite,"I mainly bought this album to get Strawberry Letter # 23,but was hopeful about this Q.jones produced,""digitally remastered"",album.Michael Jackson this is not.The music on this album is not bad ,but it's not great either. The sound was just o.k. for me.Nothing on this record really sticks to your bones.I found myself wishing I had bought some Sly and the Family Stone."
4,Well Produced Funk,"This cd still holds up I'm happy to say. I give 5 stars to Strawberry Letter 23 and the whole cd is strong. Compares to Earth Wind and Fire. Quincy Jones produced this album and it shows. It's like jumping into a timemachine back to the late 70's, early 80's. If you like smooth, funky R&B then you should check this out. Unfortunately, they didn't do a lot more. They have one other release of new material and then a greatest hits package. Too bad. These guys seemed to have a lot of potential. Great fun. Buy and enjoy."
5,Koala Brothers Christmas,"This is a wonderful story of friendship, teamwork and ingenuity. What a wonderful addition to your Christmas library!"
5,Hilarious! One of the funniest seasons ever.,*** Spoiler Alert ***This one started off as a battle of the sexes and it was hilarious. I don't want to give anything else away. Just get it.This was one of my favorite seasons.
4,Worth a second look,"As a diehard Survivor fan I have recently been buying up early seasons..so far this is the one that has stood the test of time the best. There is no pre-merge plodathon, this is good stuff from the get-go. Mean girls Heidi and Jenna, deaf girl Christy feeling like an outcast, Shauna heading for total collapse till the arrival of the men lead to an overnight recovery, and best of all, Rob's hilarious one-liners, all make this most enjoyable to watch."
2,no voice,"Its a good dvd but I returned first set because it was defective ,on some disc there were no voices ! I rec. a second set and on same disc I had the same problem no voices again ! So I desided to keep it for a month then order a new one and return the old one hopefully they fix the problem by then !Jack"
1,dvd-r,"If I wanted DVD-Rs, I'd be burning them myself. Do it right please and just release them. And if they're not getting enough sales to justify releasing the seasons on permanent DVDs, maybe they should try releasing unrated versions. I enjoy the show, but if I actually buy it instead of watching it under outdated prudish US censorship rules, I think they shouldn't be blurring nudity or bleeping words. So far, the only season I've actually seen nudity or heard expletives in was the first. And in that case it would have been better to blur (Richard Hatch). I'll bet sales would soar on this season and the one with Jeff Probst's former girlfriend Julie if the seasons were uncensored! But please, release all of the seasons with regular DVDs instead of these on-demand DVD-Rs which so many people are stating are poor quality!"
5,Old school survivor! One of the best.,"I finally got around to watching season 6, and it reminded me of what made this series so remarkable.This was hard core survivor. Today's episodes are much less severe. The contestants were divided into men vs. women and sent to their camps with nothing at all. The rewards were far less generous than they are today. They are either just individual rewards or the winners get to take at most one person. They are not allowed to bring any food back to camp. One quickly notices the absence of any of the usual challenges involving swimming - because of the piranhas and crocodiles!This was a really physical and tough Survivor.Most of the players were genuine and interesting. They rarely played to the cameras as so many now do. You'll find yourself cheering as the ""out-manned"" women pull it together and frequently give the arrogant guys a reality check.Some may dissent, but I cheered the winner who came from far behind and exemplified the sole survivor ethic"
3,Gift Giver,"Gave this as a gift for a huge fan of ""Survivor"" and he loved it! The quality was good and they will be part of the collection. Price is reasonable for a gift...not sure I would pay as much if I were buying it for myself."
5,Has it all,"One of the Best seasons ever. This is the last season where the survivors had little food rewards, and only a couple of times did they get to bring a friend. All were in bad health at the end of the show. And they all lost a lot of weight. In fact Butch lost 38 pounds, Matt and Rob lost 30. Just watch them all suffer."
1,All Survivor DVD's,"Ah bummer, I have only seen the past couple of survivor shows, now want to buy all first 20 Seasons and watch them like they are new as I have no idea who won any of them, but I see the producers made the unbelievable mistake of highlighting the winner of each season on each box buy putting their picture in the first row in the middle, i assume...how dumb can you get..darnit, i really wanted to watch these but why would i now..."
4,ONE OF PINO'S BEST SCORES,"The film is typical Caviani 'wack', but the score is lush and sweet like all Donaggio. Anyone who had enjoyed ""Carrie"" or ""Dressed to Kill"" will want to order this one, and it's better in a way because it doesn't have the shrieks associated with his post-Herrmann output. OLTRE is essentially one long suite separated into psuedo-cues and it's quite seamless as a score and a listening experience. There's a slight Marrakesh feeling due to the film's setting, but one could just as easily be watching a very sad sunset on the Riva degli Schiavoni in Venice."
1,Who is it Tucker or Rock- I have not seen the tape,"I have a question, Why does the title say ChrisRock ANd Bernie and your advertising this as chris tucker? Is Chris Tucker on this tape or not.. I would like to order the tape but I don't like chris Rock please let me know what is accurate or not"
5,"All the ""Party People"" in the house, let's jam!","Tom Joyner, host of one of America's most popular radio shows, has crafted an ""old school mix"" featuring a slew of some of the greatest dance classics of the 70's. Talk about your hits, this one has the ones that had discos ""thumping and bumping"" into the morning's wee hours. ""Best of My Love, ""Got to be Real,"" ""Le Freak,"" ""I'm Every Woman,"" along with fourteen other ""scorchers"" will get those hearts a-pumpin' and those feet a-jumpin'!An additional note, always the humanitarian and concerned citizen, Joyner includes information about his foundation in the hopes of acquiring funds to help needy college-bound kids.The check is in the mail, my man!"
5,"Tight, very very tight!","I went to a party this weekend. I happened to take part of my CD collection. This CD was one that I took upon myself to put in the stereo--and I was pleased with the results. At this gathering, everyone hit the floor to dance upon hearing these songs. Men and women, young and old, everybody including myself danced until we hurt ourselves. This CD is the best. Non-stop! I give it ten stars."
2,"Technically okay, with the Hurley touch, but....","....how many times can you get away with putting ""More Bounce To the Ounce"", ""Dazz"", ""Slide"" and ""Funkin' For Jamaica"" (which, like I said earlier, is ubiquitous) on ol' Skool mixes and expect to sound fresh? I am positively surprised that ""Atomic Dog"" and ""Genius Of Love"" is not on this, this being a bucket of cliches...find something new, we're wearing these jams out."
5,Tom Joyner old school mix,It brings back memories as I go on my way in the car beboping to the music. I would buy more if I heard them.
4,Killers?? Whatever...,"This band sounds absolutely nothing like The Killers. Perhaps they could share a bill together but not much more than that. At times they may sound like a louder, fuller Communique (esp. Suzie) and they definitely share characteristics with all the Brit Rock that's big now, i.e. Franz Ferdinand. But why so many people think they're a Killers rip-off is just completely beyond me. The album definitely loses steam toward the end, but it's all-around very good."
2,on the bandwagon,a couple of good singles and alot of filler. you will try to sell this cd in two years !
4,Cool!!,"This book is awsome~ It has many tips from shopping to one ingridient masks.I tried some and they really work!Need a lift? read it! It tells you which foods you should eat from fast food restaurants.This book helped me be healthy,inside and out! But it has not one picture , so i gave it 4 stars inside of 5,since i like seeing an image of what they mean."
1,"ANCHORS, THE ILLISTRATES HISTORY BY CURRYER,BETTY NELSON",I WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO RECEIVE THIS BOOK BUT WHEN I DID I BECAME VERY DISAPOINTED. I EXPECTED MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT ANCHORS BUT FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE QUITE SHALLOW AND VAGUE. IT IS WAY OVERPRICED AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT ANCHORS YOU WILL WANT TO GO ELSEWHERE.
1,Anchors : The Illustrated History,"I was expecting much more out of this book, especially when it is the first one dedicated just for anchors. I was disappointed when I saw it and disappointed more when I read it. I think it is a total waste of time and money."
5,A Full Philosophy of Islam,"Fazlur Rahman is a man that has contributed significantly to the study of Islam both in Pakistan and in the West through his spark of the Near Eastern Affairs Dept at University of Chicago. His is not an orthodox view of Islam, but a truly beautiful explanation of the spirituality of this religion. In chapters titled in a convention similar to philosophers past (Man as an Individual, Man in Society reads similar to a Puffendorf), Rahman espouses a philosophy of Islam. The themes are not controversial in their moral implications - indeed it cultivates a spiritual understanding of Islam that is lost in the popular literature or media these days. However, Rahman's take has unfortunately been challenged by more orthodox camps of Islam.In my opinion, it offers the most telling and comprehensive understanding of Islamic philosophy and is a wonderful, illuminating read."
3,Rather strange little mystery,"The Riverside Villas Murder contains a boy detective in the typical tradition-- sort of. We've read the kind of book before where a boy is interested in a woman and his youthful curiosity gets him involved in a murder that surrounds her. What's strange about this is that the book seems amazingly preoccupied with the boy in question's sex life. Not that I'm a prude, but it's rather jarring and odd to have that sort of thing mixed in with what in other respects is a fairly traditional detective novel."
2,"beatiful,heavy but.........","this watch have the looks of a serious diver ,50atm,heavy,size,but the movement is not working well .... stops if you are not wearing -cero power reserve.-"
1,Do not expect too much!,"One of the units stop working while I got them the next day! Before it stopped working, sometimes I was unable to hear a word simply from my room upstair! I did not expected for the price I buy they would work perfectly, but after 1 use and it broke just did not make me think that this is made as a quality product!"
1,Do not expect too much!,"One of the unit stop working while I got the next day! Before it stopped working, sometimes I am unable to hear a word simply from my room upstair! I did not expect for the price I buy would work perfectly, but only 1 use and it broke just did not make any sense that this is made as a quality product!"
4,Good performance for the price,"These walkie-talkies run on 4 AAA batteries that will last a long time. I was skeptical to purchase a pair because of the ""cheap"" price but I took my chances. After testing them out in a residential area and at the mall, they have a range of approximately 1 mile (clear reception) and possibly a little more (with static). These radios aren't ""top-of-the-line"" but with an affordable price, the overall performance makes them a bargain."
4,Great for traveling,"We recently went on a short trip with some friends of ours. We took separate cars because of the kids. These worked great. They are good for letting the other people know when you are stopping for a bathroom break or just for stretching. They work best on flat stretches of highway if you get separated from the other vehicle. They really work for about 2 miles on these stretches. If there are hills or trees, you can expect the receiption to be decreased. Overall, I would recommend these. They are cheap, but work as well as the more expensive models. Why pay more money for something you're not going to be using everyday? Save that money for the trip."
4,vtech walkie,very good clarity so far..easy to use..however plasticky and back panel for batteries are hard to open and snaps are easy to crack..with rebate a good deal
1,"Goodyear: Really, Really Stupid!","All of the Goodyear automotive items advertised, this one included, have no description. This particular (typically) stupid product description, like all of the Goodyear ""Hose"" products, do not tell the buyer THE SIZE of the tubing!! They repeatedly hype GOODYEAR, QUALITY, etc., but no information whatsoever. NO DIAMETER / NO LENGTH / NO MATERIAL! REALLY STUPID!!!"
3,No martial arts in this book!,"I bought this book because AMAZON had Martial Arts listed among the subjects of the book. There are no martial arts in this books that I found skimming through it except a single sentence about Vietnamese runners warming up with Tai Chi. Maybe I missed something, but if there was any other martial arts in the book, it was nothing significant. The book is about running. So if you are looking for a book with martial arts, don't buy this one.***Don't vote this as unhelpful!***"
1,Amateur night at Barnes and Noble,"Spellcheck...Grammercheck...Plotcheck...The author obviously wrote this book lacking these vital components.Please stop writing bad books. This book was terrible. Learn to write, and stop boosting your ego by posting your own reviews."
1,Sucked.,"Don't bother. Limp plot, annoying characters, childish ending, illogical ramblings.It reads like a teenager's creative writing exercise."
5,Just what I wanted,"I did alot of research on hanging pot racks and the features I wanted. I ended up buying this rack even though there were no ratings on this item. I had a tough time finding the beams in the ceiling to mount this but it wasn't the prouducts fault. Looks nice in my kicthen. Only thing I would recommend is looking on Amazon and buy extra hooks for this rack. I found another six hooks by this company on Amazon with the same color. Another thing, the chain that came with it is very short. I had to go buy a longer chain elsewhere. All in all though Im very happy with my choice."
5,drain stopper,this is the best drain stopper ever i even got one for my daughter she bought a house and there was no stopper i got this and its great:)
4,A Pretty Good Movie,It's a cute family movie. It's gets predictable in places but still a good message for young viewers. I like this movie and it's a good family night movie for family's with young children.
5,Zac Efron's Fan,"This movie was purchased for my daughter who is totally a Zac fan! She has watched this movie countless times. This movie is based on Zac Efron's character going after his dreams and in the end, is parents support him!This is a must see movie for ALL!"
2,Worst Horse Movie EVER!!!,"I hated this movie from the start. The acting is so bad I can't stand it. And don't even get my started on the horses. They used a different horse in almost every scene, one moment the horse has a blaze face and the next, no markings at all. When the actor (zac) was riding it was completely unrealistic. A trained horse will not just buck you off for no reason. And overall it was just an insult to the horse world."
2,The Derby Stallion,"We find totally uninspiring characters, a weak plot and some self-conscious acting. It was shot well, but their was no driving force that kept my attention to the screen without reminding me of how much of a cable TV movie this is. I hope this was just made to give Zac Efron a film career because if the writer really felt depth in this script, I would start to lose hope in the future of film."
3,Not what I was hoping for...,"The Derby Stallion could have been done alot better. It appeared to be a very low budget film. Its about this boy who decides he wants to ride steeplechase and convinces his parents to allow him to. The riding was very sloppy and some of the sences of him first riding were un realistic and alot of it was put into slow motion, like when he was first learning to jump. The two horses that played in the movie were also two completley different colors. The movie idea was good, but they could have spent more time on teaching the actor to ride and handle horses instead of what appeared to be a very rushed movie. Not a good choice for people who know a thing or two about horses."
1,lame lame lame,I would've given this 0 stars if I could have. If your looking for a solid low budget film you have found it. Don't waste your time on this movie. The filming was comical for the fact it was so lousy! I would've rather spent my time watching the grass grow in my back yard!
5,Wonderful Movie,"Our granddaughter is 6 years old, and loves anything to do with horses. She has watched this movie many, many times. Its a great story for the family also."
4,good family flick,"Bought this for our 2-year-old who is horse crazy, and turns out the whole family enjoyed watching it. Just a feel good movie in which a boy endures trials and triumphs on his way to success. Good messages for kids of all ages; even my 13-year-old said it wasn't bad, and our 9-year-old really liked it too."
4,Great Family Film!,"I was encouraged to purchase this DVD by my fifteen-year-old sister, she's been a big fan of Zac Efron's from ""High School Musical"". She was not disappointed - we both loved it (plus Zac is really cute)! It's a sweet story and has a lot of positive messages. What a pleasure to sit down and see a nice family film again... it's a rarity. Enjoy!"
1,Hole too small,"This toilet seat would be great (portable, nicely padded) IF the hole were big enough for a toddler to successfully pee IN the toilet. My daughter makes a mess every time she uses this toilet seat. It's just something about the way it's designed, because we don't have this problem when we use our non-portable potty seat. This seat was a big disappointment."
5,Peace of Mind,"This potty seat works great. My daughter would not sit on a public toilet, especially with a protective paper cover over it. This potty seat will fit in a good sized purse or small backpack. It has never pinched her. We have not had problems with it sliding around. She happily sits on it without any complaint, which is a great stress reliever while potty training. She calls it her special seat. Highly recommend."
1,beware,Beware...buy this only if you want to see your child fall into the potty...This may be one of the worst purchases I have ever made...
1,*Update* Would not recommend,"*UPDATED*As I previously wrote, this does not stay well on the toilet. It fell into an elongated toilet and my daughter also fell in. She did not want to use it any time after that. And I will not be using it again.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This is a good size for travel. But it doesn't stay on too well on the toilet. Because it's so small, my 19 month old daughter's legs always stick straight out when she sits on. Especially since you have to put it towards the back on the toilet for it to even stay on."
2,Not that good,I didn't like much. Plastic cover is not stable after few use it started tearing and you can see form inside it.
3,Cushie seat is falling apart after three uses,"I purchased this seat for my son who is potty training. I like the fact it is compact, easily goes into most bags and will fit most toilets. The problem is the seams and stitching are already coming apart after three uses, which makes it unsanitary and impossible to properly clean. This product was very disappointing! If the seam was not coming apart already, I would recommend this product but unfortunately it appears to be cheaply made."
3,Useful but with shortcomings,"The is a soft and comfortable potty seat. The only thing is that it is a little small for public toilets. That said, we have still been using it in public toilets while holding on to it. A toddler cannot be left on the potty seat on his or her own, there is a risk that the potty seat would fall inside. So I would say it's something that can be used till they are almost 3.I like it because it's soft and easy to sit on unlike the plastic potty seats."
3,Fits the purpose,"It is not the best seat you can buy for you kid, but when you are on the move and you can't pack too much it fits the purpose. I usually combine it with one of those disposable paper seats."
3,"So far, so good.. I suppose.","I would like to note that I purchased this seat to replace my potette plus ONLY because I lost my potette plus and this was the only seat I could find locally that I could travel with.I miss my potette plus.This seat is alright... it's a compact-ish fold. I put the back part on the back of the toilet and sit my son back there. The front part always caves in when he's sitting, but so far that hasn't effected the seat. We'll see.I'm going to be putting small amounts of rubber on the seat to keep it from slipping. That's one of my few ticks about it.Pros:. Compact. CushieCons:. Caves in, placing stress on the seat.. Missing rubber to keep it from slipping and sliding around the toilet.In the end, nothing will replace my potette... and this seat certainly didn't. But it's alright. It gets the job done, I should say."
1,a traveler seat that doesn't fit public toilets and flimsy too,Don't waste your money because you can't return this item.This so-called traveler toilet is not usable. It is too small for the large typical public toilet. It is flimsy and bends frighteningly underneath small children even if you push the traveler seat all the way back so it is supported underneath the back (as per the included instructions). It slips slips slips. I can't think of a single use for it. Even at grandma's house we would be better off just keeping a proper toilet seat there like the Baby BjornBABYBJÖRN Toilet Trainer- White/ Black.We have had much better luck in public toilets using theKalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Blue. The Kalencom is very sturdy and has good (but not perfect) non-slip grips. It is not a perfect seat because it is not flat but our kids do not mind it a bit and we find it much easier to use.
2,Ouch,This seat pinches my two-year-old's bottom. She refuses to sit on it unless I place my hands over the side seams.
2,"Great idea, but product needs improvement.","Not too large to take with us for potty trips away from home, but the product is flimsy (the hinges on the bottom are plastic)and it has dropped my daughter in the toilet. It does not stay in place very well at all on elongated seats. You pretty much have to stand there and make sure it doesn't slip forward so the rear of the seat is not supported while your little one goes. A good idea for more sanitary bums and kids who won't sit on public toilets yet, but overall a flimsy, not-worth-it product."
3,potty on the go,"it is a great thing to have when you are out and about. it is cushie so that's nice. downside is ....it's small on larger public toilets and the hole is a bit too small. my son is larger than most kids his age (3 years old) so for him, it is a little small and i have to make sure he sits just right so everything falls where they are suppose to and he doesn't fall with it. it would be a great thing if it was a little bit longer and wider. i know it's suppose to be small for travel, but it also has to be properly fitted for most public toilets, that's why i only gave it 3 stars. otherwise, it's fine."
3,It's ok!,"The cushion seat is great when it comes to portability; however, it tends to fold once the child is seating on it... Like if it is about to break, but it isn't. I don't know if this is because my 2 year old is too heavy (almost 30 pounds)Or because most toilets are too wide for the cushion seat... I use it everytime we're on the go regardless....And it hasn't broken!"
3,OK potty seat,"I have tried this seat on potties in public and not all that satisfied with it, it tends to bend when she moves causes her to almost fall in the potty. SO NOT WHAT I WANT TO HAPPEN. Not sure if there is a better option out there or not, I guess we will continue to use this one."
5,Awesome early potty training tool,"This is so great to have when your little one is scared of the ""Mommy Potty"" at the store. She was immediately comfortable enough to use the potty in public with this handy tool."
1,Not helpful at all!!!!,"I thought this would be great for when we are on the go, WRONG!! It slips around on almost all elongated public toilet seats. Also, my son is 30 lbs. and it would flex a bit under his weight making him feel very uncomfortable! It would be easier to take a regular potty insert with us!"
4,Great Portable Seat!,We brought this folding seat to Disney World when our daughter had just turned 3. It worked really well and was very comfortable for her.
5,Love it,"This comes in its own carry case, is light and fits in a diaper bag. I used it for my daughter and then gave it to my sister to use which her boys. They haven't used it yet but it's fantastic for taking out and about, because after all you should be able to potty train on the go. You're out shopping and your kid has to go, you don't have the potty chair with you so what do you do? You whip out this bad boy and show the other moms what you're made of. I love being prepared."
4,potty helper,"My daughter loves this seat. It fold to nice size, but I think it's a little heavy since I have to carry it in a bag with all that a toddler would need. It would be better if it had some kind of attachment part for big public toilets. I found that when I try to seat my daughter it slides back. It's okay once she sits down."
2,Not for public restrooms,"Pros: fits in the diaper bag, convenient carry case, clean side doesn't touch the dirty side.Cons: No handles - my baby wants to touch everything, the flusher, the public toilet seat etc...Most of the public toilets I have seen lately are elongated and while this fits on an elongated toilet, my baby's feet still touch the toilet seat.(I put the seat covers but he still winds up touching everything.)I'm on the market for another baby toilet seat."
4,Useful purchase,"Looks sturdy and comfortable, a little bit bulkier that expected. Did not have chance to use it in public though - we just started potty training."
3,good for air travel,"I bought this product mainly for the 10-hour flight my toddler and I took to Europe. It was definitely a worthwhile purchase given that it allowed her to go potty on the airplane toilet without me needing to hold her in that crammed space... it folds down nicely, too, and comes with a little carry pouch, though I probably would have preferred an even smaller bundle rather than the padding."
5,Love this item!,"I love this so much I bought one for a birthday gift and will buy another for toddlers who will be potty training soon! It really helped my son while out and about not feel so freaked out about the ""big potty"""
3,Uncomfortable and bulky,The seams in this pinched my son's legs so we only used it a few times before he outgrew it.
3,mommy's helper cushie traveler,This product is great for portability but it is a little weak since it has folding capability. And it hangs inside the toilet seat a little too much in the front my daughter likes to push on it. It flexes easily.
3,"An ""Okay"" product",I ordered it for my daughter while I was potty training her and realised that she had hard time sitting on the adult potty. This one served purpose at few places but it does bend and scared my daughter that she is going to fall in potty. So I hardly used it few times.
2,Not so great for public toilets,"I thought this would be a great item for my toddler who is now potty trained enough to go in public restrooms. The toilets in most of these restrooms are shaped just like this seat, only larger. No matter how much I try to put the cushie seat all the way to the back of the seat, it still slides forwards and almost falls in with my toddler's weight. The paper seat covers are a much better option and I do end up using them if they're there. If I had known, I would have stuck with buying just paper, throw away seat covers."
1,BEWARE- DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!!,"I ordered this potty seat on July 19th and should have received it no later than July 28th. Today is July 31st and the order has not even been shipped out! I have attempted to e-mail Baby Age and they have ignored my e-mails. Baby Age is anything but a quality company and I will NEVER, EVER do business with them again! I strongly urge anyone viewing this product to do the same!!"
2,Broke in 2 dropping 28 lb 3 yo into toilet water,"It broke in 2 at the middle fold dropping my 28 lb 3 yo daughter and the booster into the toilet water in our public library.We had only used it occasionally for a few months. Until it broke it was very good, soft, secure, portable, and easy to clean, with a nice washable bag to store it in - but I think my daughter will now feel less secure on the potty after it broke under her dropping both her and the broken booster into the cold dirty water."
2,Looks good on paper...,This would be a great idea IF it actually worked well on elongated toilet seats. Most all public restrooms have elongated toilets and I also have elongated toilets at home...doesn't work well at all!!! Slips around and easily. Very unhappy with this purchase. If you only intend to use it on regular size toilets then it's fine. Description of this product should be changed.
4,"Convenient, Sturdy and Comfortable","I have been using this product for 3 months and am very happy with it. My daughter loves her potty seat because she feels comfortable and safe on it. The only drawback would be that it's a bit bulky, but it's able to fit perfectly in my bag. The delivery for the product was on time as well. I would definitely recommend this potty seat."
5,best!,"who knew a toilet seat could be so amazing?! seriously tho, this has been a lifesaver for potty training. it folds up (not as small as i'd like but still fits in the diaper bag), comes with it's own bag, is padded for comfort, and seems very sturdy."
4,used it many times,at the time our daughter was being toilet traind we had to trave many timesthis seat worked great thanks
5,"Compact, Good Quality","I pack this seat in my diaper bag and use it when we are out and about (parks, running errands, or even friend's homes) as it just gives my toddlers the ease of not having to balance themselves on a toilet seat that they can actually fall into. It's been great for us, travels compactly, and easy to wipe clean. It's nice and cushioned and gives the extra confidence when out and about. I love it for my toddlers and it has worked great!"
1,Not so good.,"I have the larger step stool version of this seat, that my son has been using for over a year now and it is wonderful so I thought I would give this a try and it does not fit very well on toilet seats, even pushed all the way back like the directions say. The hole opening is very small, almost looks like it would work for an infant, not a potty training toddler. The seat with the step made by this company is totally different, has a wider hole and a cushier seat and fits very well on the toilet. But when you push this to the back it leaves a large gap in front and nothing supporting the front end of the seat. I didn't even let my son try it, it did not look safe or sturdy."
5,Cannot live without!,"Cannot live without this - use it everyday to help my toddler use the ""grown-up"" potty, and it easily stashes in the diaper bag for travelling as well. Adds peace of mind as I don't have to worry about her splashing into the potty (and saves my back a little from having to hold her up for the extended potty visits). Now I have hands free to grab toilet paper too! :) Makes sitting for extended periods of time on the potty comfortable for her little legs as well. We have weird shaped toilets too - the new, extended oval shape - and this fits just fine on every toilet I've tried it on. Just have to keep it slid back as in the instructions that come with it. Easy to clean if needed as well. I feel this also made it easier for my toddler to transition from her potty seat, to the ""grown-up"" potty, since she knew it was sized just for her. Recommended to all my Mommy friends! :)"
4,"Expressive perfomance, good sound quality.","One of my favourite perfomances of the Swan Lake. Sound is good but not perfect - record lacks some ""transpapence"" and 5.1 track has excessive reverberation added while being remastered."
2,A big let down,"If only I had read the previous reviews before I bought this book... I'm always looking for good AR-15/M16 books and thought this one ""looked"" good. When I got a good deal on this, I bought it. My heart sank the moment I received it and noticed the main photo on the front cover was a reverse. I thought to myself, ""how could anyone put a reverse picture on a book they're supposed to know about""? Unfortunately, the cover was only the beginning. There were reversed pictures through out the book. And as stated by a previous reviewer, the terminology that is used for several parts is so obscure, that I had to re-read several times to try to understand just what part he was referring to. That and the fact that nearly everything is measured in millimeters and kilograms, makes for a very difficult book to keep reading."
3,just what the world needs: another dj breaks mix.,"great collection on the kon and amir disc, but the muro disc is just another collection of 30 seconds to a full minute of breaks only. pretty tired. how about the whole track, muro. get the kings of funk collection instead, unless you're into a monotonous breaks mix."
3,intrepid traveller,"I have been studying Arabic on my own, at times with a private tutor, at times in 3-week stretches at the Arabic Language Institute in Fes, Morocco. Having finally reached the end of Volume I of Al-Kitaab, I was looking for a break, and inspected four books on media Arabic, finally choosing Newspaper Arabic as the top candidate. This is the perfect complement for those who have finished Volume I of Al-Kitaab. One knows the basic grammatical structures, but Newspaper Arabic supplies the extra vocabulary needed to cope with the newspaper. The lessons build on each other. I am intending to get through it all, memorizing extra vocab chapter by chapter, before I proceed to Al-Kitaab Volume II. Problems: some of the markings--shadda, fatha, sukun etc. are unclear; also, it would be so, so helpful if there were an affordable CD to go along with it."
3,Comprehensive bicycle repair manual in need of update,"Well written, comprehensive guide with B&W photos and line drawings but the absence of labelling on photographs is a serious oversight. Unfortunately it is overdue for a new edition. A lot has changed since 1994 when this book was published. I hope the editors break information down into smaller, 'easier to bite' sections with future editions."
2,Good basic but outdated information,"This is a good book to get started with, but don't expect to see an explanation about your components if you purchased your bike after 1995."
2,"Informative, but not as helpful as it could be.","I believe that a repair book should should include a systematic troubleshooting guide. This book, while informative on the sub-systems of a bike (ie: the chain, the gears etc..), lacks the ""top-level"" diagnostics that would make it useful.For instance, what does a clicking noise near where the chain departs the front cog mean? What are the likely causes? What sort of steps can you take to isolate the cause?"
2,Not very helpful,"I bought this book a while ago and am now trying to use it as a reference as I build my own bike starting with just a frameset. The authors obviously know their stuff but I find the presentation of the information in this book somewhat inadequate. They could use more pictures, diagrams, labeling of pictures, etc. Also, obviously the book is very much outdated. I was in the bookstore the other day and glanced thru what I believe is the updated version and it appears to be pretty much the same. I even found the exact same paragraphs and pictures in the updated version. I think this book is okay but I seriously doubt it could serve as your only reference."
1,leaks at handle,I have returned four of these 12 cup perks and all four of them had a leak in the handle. Called the company and they said to return and to pay the return postage. That would have cost me more than the perk itself.
2,Fades Fast,Limelight fades drastically after a couple of washes. I've used other Special Effects products that last just fine. This color in particular isn't great.
2,Limelight needs very light hair and LONG processing time,"This product faded quickly and showed up best on VERY white hair. However, longer processing time worked better. This is no reflection on the seller, the shipping time was excellent, thanks!"
4,Description,"Spencer is a journalist with particular interest in the events of earth (and vicinity) that elude explanation by traditional SCIENCE. His first work, which focused on the Bermuda Triangle, was titled ~Limbo of the Lost~. In this book he suggests that earth is a galactic experiment, i.e. we are someone's LABORATORY. He uses ancient civilizations to show how this experiment is being conducted - e.g. the building of the pyramid at Gizeh. From there he turns to UFOs and interplanetary science. Cond: Very clean, tight and crisp. Edges are v. lightly chipped. Corners fine. One discard stamp altho' NO other evidence of `library'. No names, no creases, no tears. 16 pages of b/w photos, handful of drawings and charts within text. 178 pages total. Quote from p.36: "" Radar sightings at Goose Bay, Labrador showed an object moving 9,000 miles an hour at 60,000 feet altitude. Our nearest approach to such a speed is 4,000 m.p.h...."""
1,Beck Arnley 016-0060 Oil Drain Plug,"Product was supposed to fit 1983 Toyota Celica GTS with 22rec engine. Thread pitch was wrong on this part, so I could not use it. I had to reinstall orginal Toyota Oil Pan Drain Plug which is as old as the car for which I'm the original, and only owner."
4,The American version,"I bought the DVD from Sinister Cinema, a good company.This is unfortunately the American theatrical version missing the 4th German chapter with Kinski. I saw this film in a theater and it's only 3 segments--Italian, French and American. If you like gritty B&W; spy films of the 60's you'll like it. Gassman-Bucella episode is the best."
4,There's not much change,"I orginally bought the TV version of this tape. Even with the editing, not much was really changed. Unless you're dead set against the dubbed, there's no reason not to just purchase the TV version."
5,Pure Excellence......,"This is a beautifully animated series. Fans of Magic Knight Rayearth and Fushigi Yugi will be very pleased with the strong story line and great characters. It's directed by the same person who did ""Revolutionary Girl Utena"". This is a masterpiece, and the dub doesn't do it justice. Buy this and do yourself a favor. I also recomend the manga, Fushigi Yugi, Magic Knight Rayearth, and Serial Experiments Lain."
5,Sailor Moon S Vol.4 Birthday Blues (uncut subtitled version),"This 4th volume of the Pioneer's Sailor Moon S tapes is good and quite interesting.There are three original subtitled episodes:ep. 100: Retire from the Sailor Soldiers?! Minako's Concernep. 101: Usagi in tears! Glass Shoes for her birthdayep. 102: The Pure Stolen! Usagi's Biggest CrisisThe first episode is about Minako (aka Sailor Venus) who feels depressed because her ""job"" as a Sailor Soldier prevents her from achieving her dreams.A good episode but not the best.The two following episodes are better.This time, Usagi is the victim of Kaorinite who finds out that she's actually Sailor Moon... The end of the second episode is extremely good (a great battle whose end is fatal for Kaorinite...)If you're a Sailor Moon S fan, just watch this tape!"
5,At the same level as TFTT and T&TFC,"As my heading states, Cat Stevens' Mona Bone Jakon is just as good as the following albums that made him a superstar, Tea For The Tillerman and Teaser & The Firecat.This album marks Cat's first foray into more introspectical, stripped down, more honest tunes from his older ""poppy"" string driven tunes of the late 60s.The album contains the popular opening tune Lady d'Arbanville, as well as the classic ""I Think I See The Light"".Other standouts on the album is my personal favorites: Katmandu, Trouble, and Lillywhite.Superb beginning of a string of great albums."
3,"not bad, not his very best...","This album has some great stuff on it. ""Trouble"" is an extraordinarily moving song if you pay attention...with this said, I must say that it is not his very best album. My advice: try ""Tea for the Tillerman"" before this album; that is really Cat at his best. If you already have that and like it, then get this."
5,Great product..mint condition...prompt delivery....great service.,"This is a classic early CDMona Bone Jakonof Cat Stevens when he began to be famous internationally. Beautiful acoustic guitar with intelligent and thoughtful lyrics, and great melodies. Classic Cat!"
1,Awful album,I really love Cat Stevens' early work such as Tea for the Tillerman and Catch Bull at Four. When I found a Mona Bone Jackson LP in a yard sale I thought I was in for a real treat. However when I listened to it for the first time I thought it was so bad that I immediately threw it into the garbage.
5,"Mona Bone Jakon, an album you will truly love and love.","Cat Stevens is one of the most original songer/songwritter just listen too the delicate sounds of the song titled: 'Fill My Eyes' or the spirtual sound of the song titled: 'Lady D'Arbanville' if you want to feel good than listen to these songs then listen to Lilywhite, this will make you feel sleepy, and that is how you need to feel if you are to continue listening to the other songs because they are like medicine for the mind.Regards Suzsanne"
2,A Low Point In Magambo's Career!,"I Don't usually trash artists or their CD's because, as a musician, I know how hard it is to put a CD together but in Magambo's case, I will make an exception. Especially if it will help some unsuspecting listener to save their money. Magambo's release is a little, INXS meets Steve Miller meets John Denver meets Donny Osmund. Magambo is all over the place with his music and none of it is very good. At best, he shows brief flashes of potential on the guitar only to drift back to mediocrity. He has some decent vocal ability, but fails to channel it on this disc. Whatever genre you prefer, you will be better off looking elsewhere."
3,Different book than the title might suggest.,"The title of this book is ""Infinite Worlds: An Illustrated Voyage to Planets beyond our Sun"". However, only a fraction of the book actually deals with extrasolar planets. I purchased this book based on the assumption that it would be about extrasolar planets. Instead most of the book is based on theories of galaxy formations, birth and death of stars and planets, and theoretical extraterrestrial life. It also describes our Solar System in detail. The artwork is very good although other space artists I have seen on the internet have superior artistic ability than Cook. Overall, though, this is still an interesting book. But potential readers should know that this is not a book about extrasolar planets."
4,reminds me of Bonestall's paintings,"The images are everything in this book. Not that the text is badly written. Far from it. But the text is clearly subordinate to letting you see the imagination of many talented artists, as they depict worlds in other planetary systems. Speculative, but based on solid science. And astronomers now have detected over 200 worlds. The book explains how from sometimes single pixels, information is teased out about a world. Impressive. We now have detected enough worlds that we can start talking of classifications and statistics across worlds.What the book clearly leads up to is a desire for more, better images. Well, you will have to wait at least 10 years, as new telescopes are being constructed.Science fiction readers might compare these paintings to those made decades ago by Chesley Bonestall. His were necessarily more imaginative. But both types can be very evocative."
4,nice but flawed,"excellent atrwork of the highest standard; would have been nice to have mentioned HD114762, the FIRST extrasolar planet discovered by the center for astrophysics in 1989."
5,it works!,I have kidney stones often (if I don't follow the low oxalate diet). I took 3 doses of this and things stated moving! Make sure you have pain meds because once you start to pass kidney stones it is very painful.
4,Good Value,"I bought this guy for some basic soldering when splicing wires. Mainly 12v stuff for trailers or hunting decoys, etc. Just small 22-18 gauge stuff and it works great. I do wish the stand it comes with was a bit better, but for the price, I'm not going to complain too much."
4,Works well so far,"I'm very new to soldering and this probably wasn't the best tool for the job I was doing, but it did the job anyway.It heated up quickly. I just need something to store it in."
4,Works,"This is the only soldering iron I have ever used so I don't have much to compare it too, but everything I have used it on has worked afterwards. Also, it has come with everything I have needed. I still haven't had to buy any extra supplies."
3,Okay soldering kit,The soldering iron is almost a little to cheap to bother buying. I bought this for a single project and would recommend buying a kit that higher quality.
3,still not certain,"the iron performed well the one time I used it to repair some model train accessories, but I didn't have any success changing the tip; however, I haven't tried that again so it may work out fine"
2,Inconsistent,"I've had this iron for around 6 months and it hate it. won't even melt solder unless you magically find the ""sweet spot"". The ""sweet spot"" is always above the tip and never where it should be."
2,Not good for what I needed.,"Forget about using this for electronics. The solder included was worthless, the tips included were too big for practical use and didn't last more than one use. The plastic thing was worthless and melted immediately. The stand barely held the soldering iron in place. The cord was too small and I had to use and extension cord even tho I was right next to an outlet. I guess the only good thing was that it heated up quickly. If you wanna use this for wood burning, I suppose it would be alright but this is pretty useless for any electronics that aren't super old and out of date."
2,Tips junk out fast,"I bought this because I had a project involving modding a video game console and needed to solder on the board. I've used it for maybe two or three hours, then I had to replace the standard tip with another, because the tip of it would no longer get hot enough to melt the solder. I made sure to wipe it off with a wet sponge while I was using it, but it didn't seem to help. I switched out to another tip, but the same happened within two or three hours as well. Even tinning the tip doesn't seem to help.Now I have to buy another one, but will make sure to buy a more expensive version with iron tips instead of nickel-plated."
2,Updated,"UPDATED 4/17/2012. The tip is no longer usable after just three or four uses. The metal that it is made out of must be very soft, because it didn't like my brass sponge. It is no longer conical: it now has a weird ""dent"". I can no longer recommend this iron.Instead, go on SparkFun's website and get their $9.95 iron. It's vastly superior to this one, even if it does't come with all the extras."
2,tips are horrible,After about 10 uses with the chisel tip the solder started to burn through the tip and eventualy leave a small indention int the tip now that tip is useless.
3,Solder iron from Weller,25 watt iron needed the tip to be retinned right out of the box. Going to try more solders tomorrow.
4,Worth the money,I only have to solder something once every blue moon and usually have to borrow a soldering iron from someone else. But for $15 and free shipping this does the trick.
1,Does not heat up properly,This soldering iron is too weak to melt the rosin that comes with it even after waiting several minutes! Maybe 25 watt is just not enough power for the type of rosin that came with it.
3,Its ok,"The product seemed to work ok. I think I was expecting more from it. It comes in a blisterboard package so you can't put everything ""back in the box"" when you finish... and there are several small parts. Also I was hoping for some better instruction on use, care, and safety because it was my first attempt at soldering."
1,screwable tip loosens after heating,The removable tip loosens after the iron heats even if you have tightened it when it's not turned on. Too problematic when you are working on boards.
5,Great little Iron,"The item was shipped and received faster than anticipated, and the iron is a great little soldering iron. The Solder and multiple tips included are a great little bonus, and it works wonderfully."
4,Good for Price,I liked this product. It heats up fast and comes with several small tips. Heat setting is fixed. Be careful when opening the clam-shell packing (which is always a source of frustration for me); I wasn't and managed to cut the cord.
4,Best buy for your money,"It doesn't have all the same features as more expensive irons, but this is THE best one you can buy for $15. I've used it for countless projects including soldering onto PCBs and it works great. Low price with decent functionality."
4,soldering kit,"This is a good kit for beginners. I purchased it for my son (15 years old) when we discovered how difficult it was to replace the Coldheat tips, which kept breaking for that system. This system works much better, but of course, it is hot, so I wouldn't have considered it for much younger children."
2,The tip... sucks,"I'm telling you the honest to God truth that the tip chipped and all I used it for was to solder led wires to a 9c connector. I saw a better Soldering Iron at Radio Shack and cheaper too, I'd check them out before buying this.However, on a positive note, it does heat up quick, solders well when it was whole."
4,"Good for simple tasks, tips difficult for precision work","Bought this to do some electronics work in a semi-hobby capacity. Its clearly no professional tool, but it can get the job done at a fraction of the price; i.e. I paid ~$15 for this, whereas the cheapest, more serious weller product I could find was around $50. I was a little lucky with the tips insomuch as one of the wide ones happened to be just the width to cover all the pins on one side of the chips I was moving. If I had to do more detailed work on the small components on most PC electronics today then I'd probably look for a better small tip, as the included pointed one is actually larger than I had originally thought/hoped.\Peter"
5,great,"I am an amateur welder but I love to make things and this soldering was just right for me. I am glad I purchased it because after I used it for what I bought it for, i realized i could fix all my broken jewelry that the jewelry stores were trying to charge me an arm & 2 legs to repair. Gold jewelry that has been broke for 10 yrs has now been restored and worn."
3,I returnede this item,"I returned this item, we found other books much better that these Cd's. At a much better cost.. nice packaging"
2,Great Content bad quality,"My kids love Clifford and were very excited to get this video collection. The problem is that the quality of the DVDs is bad and it is shaky at best when playing them. I seems to go through cycles of dark and light with the dark periods getting very shaky. This makes it difficult to watch. The content (Clifford episodes) is excellent and wholesome so I could not give it less stars, but the quality is poor."
3,Don't know which stories are in this DVD,"Help.....Can anyone tell me what the stories are about or the caption titles in this DVD that contains 5 disks.My grandson loves Clifford, but he already has quite a few of the DVDs and I don't want to get him the set if they are all the same stories hehas already. Plus we tape them on our DVR daily too. Thank you.Mary Lou"
4,Very verstile,"I use this dressing for multiple recipes, not just salad. Very good as a marinade or just too add flavor -- I've even used it in risotto!"
3,Good highway tunes.,"This CD might not be the best 80's album, but it does have some fun rockin' tunes. A real good CD to keep in the car! The band sort of sounds like a cross between ""Sweet"" and ""Badfinger"", only with a heavier side. Their most popular song, ""Never been any reason"" is a real cool song worth listening to!"
4,rock n roll classic lyrics that will live on for generations,"HAVING SEEN HEAD EAST EVERY TIME THEY CAME OUT TO THE WEST I GREW UP APPRECIATING THEIR MUSIC. GOING ON TO WORK AS A SOUND AND LIGHT PERSON FOR A LOCAL ROCK BAND,WE LOVED DOING ""NEVER BEEN ANY REASON"". IT IS STILL VERY POPULAR TODAY AT MOST ROCK CLUBS. AS OTHERS HAVE COMMENTED I WOULD BUY ALL THERE CD'S IF THEY WERE AVAILABLE!!!ARE YOU LISTENING ROGER BOYD???(PRODUCER OF HEAD EAST ALBUMS). MIKE SOMMERVILLE IS A GREAT SONG WRITER,BELIVE IT OR NOT THEY HAVE SOME GREAT SLOW SONGS ""DANCE AWAY LOVER"" BY JOHN SCHLITT,""TICKET BACK TO GEORGIA""STEVE HUTSON AND ""IF YOU KNEW ME BETTER""MIKE SOMMERVILLE. COME ON HEAD EAST LSITEN TO YOUR FANS PUT A COLLECTION CD OUT OR SOMETHING FOR US DIEHARD FANS!!!"
4,"Love the title, sound and taste!!","Pancakes are yummy and the sound of the rockin Head East is great too...enjoy the 70s, forget the techno and go back to better funner times!!!!"
4,A good rock album.,"This album came out and, I feel, turned rock and roll's head a little bit. These five guys knew how to dish out the rock with a touch of class. ""Never Been Any Reason,"" known to many as Save My Life I'm Going Down For The Last Time, is a timeless treasure that is still being played on Classic Rock radio. This is not the best album by this band, but it is the only studio one available. Lead singer Jon Schlitt left the band and took over the vocals of Christian Rockers Petra."
4,Great studio version of Head East anthems,"This CD rocks and is my first exposure to this band....they have an incredible following judging by the other reviews....I, like the other fans lament the fact that ""Head East Live"" is not available on CD...my cassette is done worn out and my LP is not far behind..thank God I got an LP...the side that features ""Its for you"" Never Been Any Reason"" is super.....can somebody out there get ""Live"" on a CD...I'd buy it in a minute..."
1,Slightly used copy for sale.,"Clearly talented but the sullen, egocentric nature of his music, well, it bored me. I like singer-songwriters and usually don't mind the slower stuff, (i.e. Mark Kozelak solo stuff) but, c'mon, give me a reason. Tried to give it another listen because some friends recommended it and bought tickets to one of his shows. No go.BTW, though he took his live show to a more uptempo beat with a full rock band we ended up leaving early, unimpressed with his sophomoric posturings."
2,Dim Bulb,"This light hardly puts out any light. If you are expecting lots of blue light, think again. If you need a subtle blue ambiance of light, this bulbs for you."
5,Simply Excellent,...and as much of a surprise as my introduction to the composer by way of another album I've reviewed. The two concertinos are worth the price of the package.
3,Interesting but not something for most of us to workout to!,"I love Rodney Yee's yoga workouts. I thought I would challenge myself by ordering this one. However, I really overestimated my ability-- this is CRAZY YOGA! WHOA- way beyond what most of us can handle.It's interesting to see how advanced yoga can be, but I only watched it once. After that, I never had any use for it.Unless you are just curious to see really advanced stuff without the chance to be able to do it yourself, I would recommend you buying a different Rodney Yee video."
3,"Not bad, but expensive and low quality","I have been searching for the perfect mouse since my hand has started giving me problems from sitting at a computer all day. The design of the mouse is great, albeit a little small for my hands, but big enough for most people. The problem is the plastics on the mouse housing are very cheap. It looks like one of those $10 giveaway mice that you can buy at a drug store. The plastics are not soft-touch and the mouse just feels really cheap in your hands. The only soft touch material is where your thumb rests. I could look past all this if it were a $20 mouse, but it's not and it should have a more substantial feel for this amount of money.Lastly, the scroll wheel it ""notched"" as opposed to smooth scroll. This is not, in itself, a problem, but the detents are so harsh that it's not comfortable to use and the wheel, like the rest of the mouse, feels very cheap."
5,A new paradigm for wildlife documentary,"The gems of this series are the first two episodes - a truly intimate portrait of the rare (jungle harpy) and the common (wild turkey). In both cases . By throwing objective scientific evaluation out the window, an undeniably more humane portrait of these animals emerges. The result is an immersive experience into the lives of other beings.Subsequent episodes are also well done, but the bar is set quite high by the first two. If you like them, you will like most of the other episodes as well."
3,"Great documentary, but poor to fair video quality","The doucmentary was good. Interesting but not in great detail. The poor video quality made it hard to watch. Interesting about the Harpy Eagle, but I had to go to other websites to get more detailed information"
5,Nature Review,"We have watched the entire Nature series. The photography is beyond excellent. We especially loved ""My Life as a Turkey"". Even our 4 year old grandson loved the Turkey episode. Watching these films has increased our awareness of the natural world around us and of the people who give their lifes to explore this world!!!"
1,no noticable difference,"i'm very disapointed. i heard these TV's were better than the older ones. there was almost no difference from my 5 year old phillips magnavox. this ""flat screen"" gives you horrible angles from everywhere except stright in front of it. This is just an expensive peice of ...."
1,WHY SO MUCH?!,"why is this so expensive. i know it has better picture, because it's screen is flat. The TV is good, nice sound quality, and the picture is good, but i don't think it takes an extra $200 to ""flatten the screen"""
5,People's Companion to the Breviary,"I have been using the Liturgy of the Hours to structure my daily prayer life for almost 40 years! I prayed it for 8 years in Latin!! I am indebted to the Carmelites of Indianapolis for this wonderful aid to praying the Liturgy of the Hours. I've begun using it in place of the ""official"" Liturgy of the Hours...much to my spiritual enrichment. As I continue my life-long study of the New Testament--yearning to learn more and more about Jesus and his message, I am deeply convinced of the need to pray in inclusive language and to focus our prayer to see it related to the needs of everyone around us, especially the poor and oppressed. The purpose of the Church's universal prayer is to pray each day in the name of the whole Church for the world in which we live. The Carmelites of Indianapolis have given us a wonderful way to do that by reminding us of that need to be inclusive and concerned for the world. Is this not the heart of Jesus' message?"
3,"Decent package, but no dedicated Email client","As my title suggests, Microsoft Home Edition is Okay, but does not come with an Email client, nor does Windows 7. Also, the app says it is not to be used in a business, which is just nonsense; good luck enforcing that one, M$."
3,Typical Microsoft product,"This is just what you would expect from a monopolistic company. It works OK most of the time but really has no value added features from the old Microsoft Office version. The biggest issue I have with it is that it is not compatible with older versions. If you send someone an attachment, they will not be able to open it unless they have the new office version. The only reason I can see for this is the desire by microsoft to guarantee their income--and further enrichen Bill Gates."
4,Bit the bullet and upgraded,"We've been using Office XP for way too long, but it did everything we needed it to do so there was no reason to upgrade.When my wife got a new laptop, some of the software she uses under Windows 7 wouldn't work with Office XP, and we were forced to bite the bullet and upgrade to the current version. And it honestly isn't bad! Very different coming from something so old, but there are a lot of improvements that make it worthwhile.I'm not crazy about how Microsoft changed around it's various licensing schemes and the cost of upgrading, but the Home and Student version hits the sweet spot of giving us what we needed without too extreme a cost.If you only need the basic applications in Office, and it's time to upgrade, this package is definitely worth a look."
4,Don't Speak French,Pros: Like the product once I got use to the panels.Cons: With Outlook Express e-mail the spell checker corrects in French. Have not found a remedy for this yet. I can't live without spell checker in English. Spell checker works fine in Word in English. Go figure.
3,It's just ok,"It would be nice to have a ""how to use it"" book with the program. I am finding the easy to use tabs at the top not so easy. I don't like having to go to a search engine to find a how to book when it should be included with the program. If you aren't computer literate then it is a slightly difficult program to use if not you will probably breese through it."
1,Don't Buy This Product,"MS Office Home is too ""bulky"" and is not work with many other existing programs. It caused a major hard drive meltdown in our computer and Microsoft Customer Service was not helpful."
4,MS Office purchase,"I purchased the MS Office Home & Student software from Amazon, and installed it on my laptop. Although I haven't had much occasion to use it yet, it does feel and operate just like other MS Office software I have used previously."
3,Not happy,"I use MS office for relatively basic operations such as word processing. I purchased this version of office for the PowerPoint that comes with it. This product requires a large learning curve to use efficiently. Other versions of MS office have not been as bad. Unfortunately, this version is substantially more difficult to use in order to accomplish many of the same tasks as before. I think MS tried to make too many useless changes just to have a ""new"" product to sell."
3,Product quality downgraded,"This new version of Microsoft Office is not good. Someone should beat into the heads of Microsoft marketers the saying, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". The previous version was much more user friendly, plain and simple. This version is hard on the eyes and is not as easy to work with. Also, Access is not packaged with it and needs to be bought separately.Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007"
4,It does what it says it will....,"Even though MS decided to change some of the locations for editting options and some of the icons it still does what it says it does. Primary functionality works like a charm and after some hunting and pecking to try and find where they moved some of the editting options (in Word, for example) it executes cleanly. My system came pre-loaded with this version so all I had to do was enter product key and it didn't even spend an hour going back out to the web to verify and force me through additional registrations. Overall, happy with it!"
3,Micosoft office 2007,The product actually came 7 days earlier then expected. The 2007 word prgram is a step back from 2003. I do not think it is as easy to use or to find the tool or utility one is lookng for. In their drive to be current and up to date with the interface I believe they have actually interfered with the purpose of an office tool which is to be easy and quick to use. Office tools are not video games and ease of use is desired over non functional features.
3,Doesn't seem to work as well with Office 2003 on your computer,"I had some problems installing this, had to be done twice. I wish it would integrate or replace my Microsoft Office 2003 but instead I seem to have both on my computer so when I open an old document, it's opened with '03 and sometimes I accidentally open the old Word. I wish I just had ONE Word so things didn't get confused like this. Could be doing something wrong, but it should be easier than this, it's not like I never use computers, I've been using Microsoft and Word for at least 15 years.Other than that, I didn't like the tool bar change from 2003 to 2007 that took a lot of getting used to and still have to spend some effort finding somethings. With use, as with everything, it gets easier. And all in all it is fine, it's not like I would go back to only using 2003."
2,Chaos,"My explanation for the appearance and utility of the new Word 2007 is that a group of programmers who had never used Word or WordPerfect were told to create a word processor with certain features. (I suspect that foremost among such features were ""shiny"" and ""flashy."") I would liken the result to the group of blind men, each of whom who touched one place on an elephant and then were asked to describe the animal. The saving grace is the one customizable toolbar on which you can place shortcuts for most features you actually want to use. Without that toolbar, every step you take must be preceded by multiple clicks through multiple menus which have been sorted according to parameters which remain a mystery to me.Despite much effort, I have yet to figure out how to append labels to a document without destroying the formatting of either the document or the labels. I have tried inserting the labels as an object and as text, with every kind of section and page break in between. No success."
5,Works like it's supposed to,"There is some getting used to involved with this product. However, once you get over that hurdle, it is a great program to work with. I feel an improvement over the past releases."
1,Disappointing,"My son is a returning college student who has used regular Office. This version seems much harder to use and is substantially different, even though it may do the same things as standard Office."
2,Microsoft has screwed up the office suite,"Microsoft has badly erred when it made the interface to the Office applications more icon based and removed the old menu structure completely. They changed where some of the options are located and they didn't always put them under a logical icon. One word - FRUSTRATING!As for Word, it still does some very annoying things to try to ""help"". I have never enjoyed working with Word if I have to graphics and tables. It seems to arbitrarily rearrange items on the page. It obviously is not Publisher.Excel graphing has been rendered all but worthless for trying to graph technical data, especially on a separate axis. Adding new series to a chart and modifying properties is so inconvenient that I have stop even trying to use it."
3,cumbersome and buggy,"The completely redesigned layout of commands and menus is awkward and confusing and requires quite a bit of re-learning. The .doc extension has changed to .docx, and the Home & Student edition has a nasty bug that permanently changes the spellchecker in Outlook XP to French. The only fix offered by Microsoft is a recommendation that you upgrade from XP to Vista. Happy computing!"
5,Microsoft Office Home,Bought this for my grandaughter - she's going to High School this year and will need it to write reports and do math. Very good and LOTS OF UPDATES from previous versions.
3,"Word,,,,,","Although a bit expensive, necessary to make my computer do what I need it to do....best price around was here with free shipping and no sales taxes..."
4,Great produce!,"It is a great a piece of software. The only thing the writing at the top says for non-commercial use. You would think to much of it on freeware or shareware but this is neither. But when it comes to the quality of the software, it is excellent."
1,Rubbish,"Complete stupidy.Would you buy a new car if the manufacturer decided to move the steering wheel to between your legs, if they changed the brake pedal to a lever on the dashboard, etc. This is what MS have done with this release of Office. The user interface has been completely changed, and I can't find anything. Pointless really, because the underlying functionality is identical to Office 2003. Maybe that is the point, if nothing has changed, give it a new cloak.I've been using it at my work. I asked my employer to deinstall it, and install Office 2003 instead."
1,Classical Microsoft junk,"Office 2007 replaces all the menus & toolbars from previous versions of Office with ""The Ribbon"".The Ribbon is a highly non-intuitive gimic that forces you to throw out your hard learned knowledge from previous versions and re-learn how to navigate the programs from scratch. You will waste hours punting around the Ribbon, trying to to figure out how to execute tasks you're used to doing in seconds.Worst of all, there is no way to configure Office 2007 to have the look/feel of Office 2003; you're stuck.Bottom line, Office 2007 is a disastrous product that has severely impacted my productivity. I really regret having purchased this product."
2,Office 2007 Home and Sudent,"This product has some good features, but the home/student version will not let you e-mail from it, you have to save it first and then e-mail from your email program. That is WEAK! I would recommend either using the Word programs that come with your computer and saving the $, or shell out the extra $ for Office Pro."
2,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 review,"Both Word 2007 and Excel 2007 have changed looks drastically from Office 2000 that I was using before. Things I was used to on the tool bars are very hard to find and I'm still trying to adjust. I guess I hate change, just for the sake of change. The functions in both office 2000 and office 2007 are basically the same but you get at them differently. It took me almost an hour to figure out how to print labels from a spread sheet using word. It is much more complicated than office 2000 word."
5,Great price.,"After checking around for the best price for this product, I found it on Amazon. Fast delivery too. Can't go wrong."
1,"Please, reconsider switching to 2003","My review is plain and simple: Microsoft Office 2007 is a pain. I hate it.Unfortunately, Microsoft Office software designers decided to redesign the look entirely, and the result is forcing users everywhere to completely relearn the entire software. They tried to make the options more ""user-friendly"", but for someone who is wanting to do more advanced documents, creation time is at least doubled. I'm not sure what the problem with the old software was, but they should consider reverting 2007 to a format more like Office 2003."
3,Wish it was better,"I bought this for my wife who is taking business classes for an associates degree. Now, she needs Microsoft Publisher which I will have to buy. It would be nice if that was included in this bundle since it is called ""Home and Student""."
3,Dissappointed,"I like the new product packaging. But I am dissapointed by the new changes. I'm not sure what's up with Microsoft. I guess they feel that they have to change the look-and-feel of the software when they release a new version. This time, I think it was a step backwards.Many of the familiar controls are now missing from the main toolbar. Yes, they are available through other places, but it has changed the convenience.They have made many irrelevant things stand out like never before, and hidden the useful stuff.As I say, I'm dissappointed with the latest changes."
4,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,"I haven't had much time to ""play"" with this yet, but have been amazed at the features of Word and Excel as well as Powerpoint. I have ""practiced"" making spreadsheets and making letters unique instead of ""run of the mill"" documents. In fact, I can hardly wait until I can have a couple of uniterruped hours just to delve deeper into all of the goodies."
4,Microsoft Office and Home Student 2007,"Received the item in A+ condition and installed easily. It is a bit frustrating when first using Excel as the Home version toolbar is quite different from the Professional. Other than that, no complaints"
3,MS Office Home and Student,"As a former user of MS Office Basic, I'm somewhat disappointed with this new version. It utilizes too much pointing and clicking, too many cutesy icons! Give me the old version at a decent price, please!"
3,Positives and negatives,"The product is visually better but you have to relearn where things are.Not everything comes over from version 2003 intact, and as usual they have changed enough to add another layer of frustration.Read several of the other reviews to get the flavor of the new Office.OneNote is a new product that I haven't started to learn (yet).Being able to license on 3 machines is a strong positive."
3,Watch out for the vendor!,"To start, this is a great product. Naturally, you'll want the best price. Amazon normally is the place. In this case, I ordered from one of the Amazon vendors (not yet rated, but if nobody uses them, how will they get rated?) I have a client that needed this product(I own it and recommended it to him), so I ordered it, trying to save him a few bucks. End result - I never got the product, never got an explanation nor an apology and nothing from Amazon either. I just got a credit on my credit card, so no, it didn't cost me anything except that to meet my obligations, I had to run to the retail store and purchase this. Instead of saving my client a couple of bucks, it cost him extra (and it cost me some credibility). I would have eaten the $50 extra, but my client would have none of that. What a guy, huh?"
2,Kinda unhappy,I ordered this product as brand new. when I got it in the mail and opened the package I found the software had been opened. I called Amazon and told them about it. The customer service people were very nice but not very helpful. I was unhappy because the software has a limited number computers it can be loaded on and I still don't know if it was used or really new like it was supposed to be. I did load it one of my computers and it worked but I have not tried to load it on my others yet.
4,Easy to use,"This program has a lot of functions, more than I need, but it's easy to use once you become familiar with it. Great for creating spreadsheets and presentations if you are a student."
3,mixed success,"A good bundling of features that for the most part work as well if not better than the edition it replaces. BUT two major problems - During installation would not recognize product key - after following various time consuming, frustrating directions, finally got a human to give a new different key. Another huge flaw in new edition is that one can not scan from printer onto word and do editing. If the amount of correspondence and useless remedies are any indication MS has big issues they choose to ignore. After all this a MS product being installed to a MS product. The ease of installation promised by both Vista and Office was not easy."
5,Great Program!,I needed to upgrade my wordprocessor so that I could upload papers to my university's web site. This program was the right one and it is easy to teach oneself the ins and outs of the program. If you haven't upgraded your wordprocessor in this century . . . I recommend it and this is the PERFECT program.
2,Microsoft 2007 home office,"I do not like this new office suite.It is cumbersome and difficult to do basic things.I was also very frustrated that I could use the CD for one computer and when I tried to install the same program in my other computers at home, the CD will not work.Very poor introduction from Microsoft.Naresh"
1,Did not receive purchase,Please cancel this order and refund money back to my credit card. I have not received this item and no longer need it. I purchased the product from another vendor.
2,"Hard to open box, no instruction given","The software was packaged in a hard to open box, and there was no printed instruction located anywhere on the box on how to get it open. To get the software box open, I had to Google ""how to open Microsoft Office 2007"", to find out how to open the box. This was totally annoying.Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007"
3,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,"I think that is very good shopping with Amazon, so I am always prefer to use it for all what I need.therfore, Amazon good place for shopping."
1,Who Moved My Cheese?,"I am a technology teacher and must stay current with newest versions of software. I give this product 1 star because it has taken the basics of the product, and turned them into a confusing mess.This version of Microsoft Office is not user friendly. I find nothing logical about the software. Too many features have been moved, and users can not get up to speed as quickly. I will definitely be using the tutorials on the Microsoft website.PS: There is a very large colorful button in the upper left hand corner. It is called the Office Button. The front of the software packaging should alert customers that it is active and may be useful.Frustrated Teacher"
4,"Office Suite for students. So far, it is fine.",I am just starting to use it again so I really cannot write any review as of yet. Give me some time.
3,Environment,"This CD comes housed in a large hard plastic case, that is even hindged. Microsoft need to start creating packaging that is friendly to the environment. Amazon needs to identify those products which are environmentaly friendly with a green icon of some sort. Microsoft could then be enticed to offer a green version of Office to earn the green icon designation (perhaps for a couple dollars less to entice consumers) that ships without all the plastic packaging waste."
3,MS stuff is overpriced,"No matter where you buy it even at great prices that you find on Amazon, it's way over priced for the occasional user.Amazon service as usual was outstanding!"
3,Good price on amazon,"I selected two day shipping because I needed this product A.S.A.P. and it took 4 days to get here- a waste of money. I'm in school and I later found out that my campus bookstore provides this for a discount rate of $60. So if you are a student, check with your school first before you purchase. If not, this is the best price you'll find and the product was brand new in original packaging. I do wish my campus still used Office '03 because I like that version much better."
1,Not for Business Use!,"I bought this with my new computer. I was really irked to find out that I couldn't use it for my business which was the reason I bought this in the first place. The license agreement says ""The software is not licensed for use in any commercial, non-profit, or revenue-generating business activites."" No description of the product warned me of this. Now I have to go to the trouble of returning it, if my OEM will allow me to return the software. And now I have to go through the customer service nightmare and runaround. What a ripoff!"
2,microsoft office 2010,"If it isn't broke, don't fix it. The product arrived quickly and was packaged in a manner that it wouldn't sustain damage. I was very pleased with the service.My problem is with the product itself. I don't have time to take new courses every time a program is modified. The older version. Windows 95, was easy to understand, and I was able to accomplish what I set to do. Eventually, I'm sure I will get used to it, but I was quite content with the old product.Again, as far as the service and delivery of the product, the service could not get much better. Therefore, my review in no way affects the service and delivery of the product. Thank you for your prompt attention."
1,Where is everything?,"I've been using Office for 10 years and can walk people through tasks in Word & Excel without looking at their screen. I bought Home & Student 2007 for my new computer - not knowing about the ""upgrades"" to the menus I knew so well. Twenty minutes into using Word 2007 I was in tears and on the phone with customer care. I had a report and labels to print for class the next day and needless to say was in a panic. Customer care tried to help but all I wanted was the old menu back - which he informed me was not possible. I vented my frustrations and hung up. I haven't used it since..."
1,User Unfriendly and serves Microsoft ALONE!,"User Unfriendly and serves Microsoft ALONE not the user or you the purchaser! In order to to use it one has to so called activate the program after downloading to your computer. Then the trip continues by sending you to microsoft site to buy more software!After registering the Word and typing your first assay, takes too long even to find the print function.It is a terrible experience; if you have the 2003 edition, stick with it. Total waste of money."
4,Not Bad!,"This program is very attractive on your screen. It has a lot of improvements, but some options related to word and excel seem to either be left out or hard to find. I been using it faithfully at work and with my school work for over a month and I find that it's not really user friendly and it can be time consuming. You really have to look hard for common options."
2,Office Hom & Student 2007,"I am sorry I purchased this version. I have several years experience with MS Office Suite and this is ""dummied"" down so much I am having to relearn the programs and how to circumvent the preset actions. All the extra built-ins are probably great for someone with no experience; not for me.Other than that small problem, it still (almost) acts like what I use on the job."
4,Office 2007 OK,"Microsoft has done it again. Office is Office, but they moved the functions to different tabs and where you are used to finding it, has moved.You have to learn where to find what you want to do, once you've done that,it's OK. Be careful when you save, make sure you save it to the old version selection, instead of 2007's. If not, it won't open on any other version than 2007."
2,Great if you can find it,"I use this at work everyday. The outlook is great, because it offers a few new features and is really simple to use. However, the Word, Excel, and Powerpoint products have drastically changed. If you can find where they have moved everything it runs well, but don't be surprised if you spend 20 minutes doing something that previously took you 2 minutes to do, because you can't find the right options."
4,Office Home and Student 2007,"Having gotten used to the new look of Microsoft Office 2007 from using Office 2007 Professional at work, I had no trouble getting used to this version of Office. One fantastic addition to the home and student version is Onenote. I love this notebook style program and use it a lot."
3,A Microsoft Product,"Not much to say here, new interface is a pain but it works. Have to remember to save documents back for Office 97-2003 because of the new format in Office 2007 or you can change the settings."
4,Microsoft home and student,Ok program but a lot different from previous edition. shipped in a timely fashion and received in good condition. Would do again.
5,Review for Microsoft Office purchase,"I received the software in a timely manner and it was brand new, as stated in the posting. I would purchase from this seller again."
3,A Home User,It appears to function like its predecessor but I have to learn all over again where the tools are. I don't sense any improvements that are any benefit to me. I guess Microsoft has to change something to show everyone their trying to make it better and to keep their employees busy.
3,If it weren't for school. . .,"As I was saying, If it weren't for school, I'd get an older version or go with another product. Perhaps OpenOffice.com or Word Perfect. Why? My favorite functions are now burried in the area at the top of the screen. Some are so well burried that I cannot find them at all. Help is no help and advice from ""experts"" doesn't seem to be an option. There also don't seem to be any experts.As long as I don't want to do anything really creative, It's a satisfactory piece of software. And, most important, it is required by every on-line college I investigated."
2,Microsoft money maker,had to purchase this because my computer will not work with my work software. Had to install xp. so I had to purchase office twice. One comes with the new computer and one that I purchased.
1,Surprise - Not Really 3 Licenses - Windows OEM Users,"Yep, if you have any OEM version of Windows (XP or Vista) on your PC, then you can only install this on one PC. Read the license agreement, it is clear on this.What version of Windows do you have? Well, if you didn't buy it yourself and install it yourself; and if you didn't pay $100 extra when you bought your PC to have them install the Retail version, then you, like everyone else in the world, are using an OEM version of Windows.Once again, MS has left us feeling violated and sick. Read the license agreement. They market this as a 3 license solution, and in their own license, they limit it to 1 install.Beware, always be wary of MS licensing practices."
5,Different is never a bad thing.,"It gets some getting used to, but once you've figured it out, its a piece of cake to use. However if you're still dead set with the previous format from windows office, than you should stick with that because this will only frustrate you and cause you nothing but grief."
2,Poor service,I initally ordered this product from another seller on Amazon and after a 4 weeks wait it never showed up. I therefore purchased it from Amazon along with next day delivery. Product never arrived next day in fact it took 4 days to get to Florida. Amazon refuned shipping fees but I would have prefered to have recieved my goods in the promised time frame.Will be very wary about buying goods again on line from Amazon.
1,disapointed,First I was sent the wrong item and had to return it. I sent two emails to the vendor and received no answer and finally I received notice from Amazon that my order has been canceled because the item did not ship within thirty days. Not a happy customer.
1,upset,"I've not received the order yet, so I can't review it. I would like to cancel the order for non receipt. Please credit my account."
2,Missing upgrade,"I bought this when there was an offer for an upgrade to 2010. Some of the reviewers claimed to have gotten it, but I did not. Nor can I find any good place to ask Amazon about it. I used to really like Amazon. The customer service is really not as good as it once was.The product itself is typical Microsoft fare. You'd do better to stick with Open Office for free if you can help it."
4,Microsoft Office works for my travel agency,I can get spread sheets to other agents and send quotes to customers easier than without this system. Is reliable and does what we need.
3,"Needs and Wants, Office 2007","I am satisfied with my purcase of Office 2007. I bought it just a couple months ago. It is better than 2000 version I had been using. However, now I see you are offering 2010. And, you are offering to ship it free with purchase of 2007 set. I would have liked to have waited for this offer, had I known. Any chance of an adjustment in a situation like this?In any case, I am happy with Amazon as a supplier of my software.Sincerely,Russell Mills"
5,MS Office 2007,Why upgrade to 2010 version when all the other students are still using office 2007. My low budget mindset told me to use Office 2007 for my kids computers because its almost half price.
1,Too complicated and too different from a version that worked,I have already removed this from my computer and reinstalled my old version. This new programme is horribly complicated. I don't want to go out and take a $300 class to learn Word all over again.
2,Office Home and Student 2007,I'm unhappy with it. People can not open my attachments unless they have a reader and no one has a reader. Also I lost my spell check with Outlook Express since Office Home and Student 2007 is not compatible with OE. It's all been very frustrating. 2003 works much better at this point and I no longer have it.
3,Office 2007 Home,"Good product but I didn't realize that it does not include MS Access, which is one of the things I was looking for."
1,Microsoft Left Out Most Important Part,The Outlook portion of Office is to me the most important part of the Office product. Upon receipt of the item discovered it didn't even have what I originally ordered it for. Outlook is far superior to Windows Mail.
1,Never Recieved the Software,"I never received the Microsft Office Software I ordered and could never get a response from You or the seller as to what the problem was. Although Amazon.com was the one that charged my credit card account, you kept saying my problem was with the seller who would never respond to my inquiries and apparently you wouldn't help getting them to respond. I have asked my VISA to stop payment to you because I haven't received the software or a response from you or the seller. At this point, I will never order anything else through Amazon.com again.Roy Geisler"
5,Perfect! Wonderful!,I got my product the first day of the time period that they gave. Everything was as advertised. Software worked great!. Would buy from agian.
3,Not perfect,"I do not do well with anything about a computer that is not real straight forward. I have not been happy with the word program. I go to close a document and it makes me close it twice and the word program from 2003 did not make me do that. I do not want to spend time calling customer support so I just downloaded open source and use their word similar program and it is just fine. I am sure it is something that would take all of two seconds to fix but I don't like feeling helpless when I expect it to just be right to begin with. They sell a million of these, right? Also, it bugs me that I can't convert Microsoft Works documents into word. They are the same company for crying out loud. Anyway, my wife insisted I get her excel program back after I deleted it when we got a new computer and this was a very reasonable price to make my peace with her. It's probably pretty good for the money."
5,software,"I am very pleased with the software, it is exactly what was advertised and the price was more than fair."
4,Worst. Package. Design. Ever.,"I normally wouldn't rate a product down a star just because of the packaging, but this one is so unbelievably bad I had to. It literally took me 20 minutes to open it and I never actually opened it the right way - I had to break it. And pieces of plastic shot everywhere. And my thumb is bleeding. And I can't toss the box because the product key is on it.If I ever meet the guy who designed this and/or the guy who said, ""whoa, this is a great idea!"" I swear to god I will kick them in the nards."
1,Come on Bill. You can do better than this.,"This product should have been named ""Microsoft Office: Treasure Hunt Edition"". The structure and interface of this software is a joke. I guess this is what happens when Bill is gallivanting all over Africa instead of running his company. If you have the old versions of these programs and access to a usable computer (not Vista), I would suggest you do what you can not to purchase this product. You will find yourself searching for commands that in most cases are not easy to find without customizing the toolbar. I really thought with it being a Microsoft product that it would have been of better quality and ease of use. After three months, I've decided I was wrong."
2,MS Office Home 2007,I purchased this product to replace Word Perfect which is not compatible with MS Vista. I understood that it would convert my WP files and it does that however it would not convert/accept the MS Outlook Explorer address book in any MS windows mail or labels/address book file. There is no Help menu readily available and the on line help file does not address the issue of moving an address book from one MS windows program to MS Vista windows mail program.I received excellent service from Amazon.com but literally no service from Microsoft. I have repeatedly asked for assistance with this issue to no avail.
2,Office Home and Student 2007,"I had been using Office 97 mostly just Word and Excel. Microsoft discontinued support for that version, so I thought I would try Office Home and Student 2007. For me it is like a completely different and difficult proposition to learn where all the simplest functions are. With 97 I found it easy to create a macro that would paste unformatted text. I recorded my steps to do an unformatted text paste in 2007, but when I use the macro it doesn't repeat the steps I recorded. With 2007 you have to select from eight toolbars before you can find the function you need to use. I may go back to the Office 97 suite even though it is now not supported by Microsoft. Nevertheless, I did get the software for 2/3 the price at a local retail store. Maybe I'll like it better later."
5,DID ITS JOB,Well now 2010 is out so hopefull you will purchase that one. I bought this aboiut 2 years or more ago. It worked as it was suppose to at the time. No complaints.
4,win 2007 review,Windows 2007 is a great tool. I had it on my second computer and wanted to add it to my laptop. I have had no problems and am pleased with the result.
4,Office home and student,"The order came to my house in due order, unfortunatly I haven't yet loaded it because the computer that I am going to put it on is temporarily down because of some minor work being done to the house so I can't honestly say if it works or not, but the package was in pristine shape and the packing that it came in was more than addequate and the delivery was quick. I give this shippment four out of five only because of the fact that I have not loaded the product and can't comment on the shape of the product itself, which isn't the vendors fault."
1,Microsoft WAY off target with this dud,"If Microsoft's Home and Student 2007 software were a test pilot it would have crashed the airplane. In test pilot parlance: They ""Poked the Pooch.""This expensive offering doesn't even include email capability like Outlook.Such a waste of time!!!! I sent it back!!!Jim Beazley"
3,"Fabulous value, but...","If you use MS Office at home, this is the only way to go! It is way less expensive than buying the full version - and I don't use the other features, anyway. I am glad they finally labeled this as Home and Student - let's get real, that is how so many of us used the ""student"" version.Having used computers for 20 years, yikes, I have forgotten way more programs than I use. I must say, the new version of MS Word is cumbersome and confusing. Instead of becoming more intuitive and using less keystrokes, it moved the other way. Yes, I'll get used to it, but come on Microsoft! Why did you make it so complicated to open or save a file?!!Also, the doucments save as docx files, which aren't compatible with the rest of the world, so if you want to share with most of the rest of the world, you have to do a save as...Too bad there isn't any real other choice out there."
5,Happy with purchase,"I needed to buy Microsoft Office for college. Since I did not need Outlook, the Home and Student version was perfect for my needs. This was the lowest price I was able to find anywhere."
1,Home Office 2007,The product was sold referencing a one year free e learning subscription. The access code received in my purchase was invalid. Nobody would help me. Everyone says talk to Amazon for a valid code. I wasted so much time trying to get help.
3,Had to upgrade -- very confusing even for experienced user,"I have been using MS Office Products since they came out. This latest version is completely new in terms of menu options, short cuts, and functions available via the menu bars. I had to upgrade and I am relearning from the beginning (almost) how to use Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. I would not recommend upgrading to this product. Plan on many many hours of learning if you do upgrade."
1,Don't get it,"Shalom,STOP! Don't purchase this!Office 2010 is about to come out!Why waste your money on an outdated program? It doesn't work the same as the last version either and is a bit frustrating because of that. You used to be able to hit ""Save"" and it simply saved it on your desktop. You can still get it to do that but it takes a bit more work to do. If you are already running it in a desktop icon and you hit ""save"" it will save it again but it has to go to another icon location rather than that which you have been using. It may be that it doesn't work as smoothly with Windows 7 as it did with XP but in any case, just wait for 2010 to come out and deal with the inevitable frustrations of all new programs then rather than now and again later when you decide to update to 2010."
1,Hard to adapt to this after years of Windows XP,"Have been thrown by the new requirements of this software. It seems to me to have needless difficulties simply saving a doc to another location, changing formatting, and many other word processing tasks. I'm struggling with a guide book published by Microsoft-- another $25 expenditure--Office Home & Student 2007 which I should have got from Amazon but I needed answers right away!"
1,MS Office 2007,"Since installing MS Office 2007 on my desktop and two laptops I have had nothing but problems and I use Word extensively for my work to write complex reports. The problems we have experienced, and continue to be plagued by are; numerous security updates through MS that have created hardware problems, the fact that MS never informed us that Office 2007 did not have a compatible spellcheck interface with Outlook Express, documents and whole folders disappearing from one computer to another on USB drives, and creating such an impossibly complicated version of Word that it is taking me months to use it....and I was exceptionally adept at Word 2003, which we thought was a great program and used for years.NICE GOING MICROSOFT. WE NOW UNDERSTAND WHY MS IS SO DESPISED!"
4,Love what it has but it is missing Outlook!,Microsoft Office 2007 is much better then the 2004 version I was using however I do miss OUTLOOK. I am resigned to us MSN Mail and very inferior program to Outlook!
3,confusing after so many years with Word,"I purchased this so that I could use it with a new computer with Vista. The look is very different from previous versions of word. I haven't yet figured out what is better than older versions of Word. I am able to save work documents in a way that is compatible with earlier versions of Word, which is helpful as I often start a project on one computer and finish it on another. This new version is not backwards compatible, so I cannot work with 2007 versions on my other computer unless I save them as 2003 Word."
1,You will be lost for weeks or maybe longer,"I installed and tried to use this new version. The user interface is completely different. I went online at Microsoft to see what this was all about. They call it a ""Ribbon"". What a mess. I can't find anything.It seems like it takes me so much extra time to do the most basic operations. If you have an older version of Office and it is working well for you, I highly recommend just sticking with it until Microsoft fixes it somehow. After reading reviews at other sites, I can't believe it actually had 4 stars on Amazon. On CNET, it was 5 out of 10. I wish I would have read these reviews before I purchased it. I felt like I was driving a car with square wheels. If it isn't broken, don't break it. The file conversion thing is also a lot of trouble to deal with."
1,Where is Outlook 2007?,MS Office Student & Teacher edition has always included MS Outlook. Microsoft replaced the useful Outlook with the useless Onenote?
1,Awful Product ...,"If you are accustomed to the 2003 version, good luck figuring out the 2007 version. Once again Microsoft took something that was pretty good and made it terrible."
3,Good and Bad,"i bought this office when i got a new computer. The word is impossible to get used to after using the old type for almost more than 10 years. The powerpoint, however, is a lot esier. the only problem is that at school our ms office 2003 is not compatible to i always have to resave my work in ""compatibilty mode"" whenever i want to bring it to school."
4,Great - once you get the hang of it,"I have been using this (Word) for about 2 weeks now and am still getting used to it. The user interface is different from the XP version and there are some font inconsistencies between the two. However I am slowly getting the hang of it and am beginning to really like it. To maintain compatibility (I have an XP and a Vista networked at home), I save the file as a Word 2002-2003 document. I don't see any difference (except when I use fonts not available in the XP version), so I am guessing that I am not using any of the advanced features that this version has to offer.Pro: Nice user interface (once you get the hang of it)Con: Font inconsistencies with previous versions. It would be nice if Microsoft would add the missing fonts to the previous version.I should soon begin using Excel and Powerpoint and just might update this review then."
4,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,Great Price and lots more features then the MS Office 2000 I was previously using.Required much relearning of the many associated tool bars in to use effectively.
4,Its Microsoft Office for Vista,"There is not much I can say about a product I have to purchase just because I have a new computer with Vista on it. (Another program I didn't really want) This is not a bash on the program...It's Microsoft Office. You get pretty much the same thing as you always have when purchasing Microsoft Office. There are a few things that are different. Cosmetic - Looks different. I guess you would say more streamlined. Tabs & Buttons - It throws you at first, but if you are familiar with Word, Excel etc., you figure it out and continue your work. My bottom line is that it is ""Microsoft Office"", I needed it, I got it, I will adapt & I will use it."
3,Very nice and brand-new look,"The interface is very nice and has a brand new look. Some of the functions I'm used to in Office 2003 though are hidden in a new Windows Icon on the top left and it takes a little getting used to. Some functions take longer to get to since you have to navigate to multiple buttons/options.I hate the ""Non-commercial"" label on the top of the window. I don't know why M/S needs to remind me of that all the time since I know what I'm buying. It would have been better said, ""Home and Student Edition"" instead.Can't say I've looked into the templates included in this version but I expect it to be more fashioned towards the typical student and home user."
4,Can't be beat!,"This product, older but still stable and useful was worth every penny. I needed a word processor for school and work but didn't want to shell out the $$ for the latest version that I wouldn't be using every day. This product was the answer. Plus, since Windows still supports it, I have been receiving updates and Windows patches seamlessly. This product was just what my system and my wallet as looking for."
5,On time OK,"This is Microsoft Office 2007 with a minimum package. It is perfect for my grandson who is taking computer training in the 8th grade.He tells me it matches what he is using in school. It was easy to install with the exception of the 29-character long product key, which took me a couple of tries to get right.Over all this is an excellent product for the price. I wish they had kept the Office 2003 menus."
1,Do not buy from any software seller that does not have a long history and a high rating. These people robbed me and won't reply,"Do not buy from any software seller that does not have a long history and a high rating. These people robbed me and won't reply to my emails. The software worked for a little while and then quit. I was also promised a free upgrade to Microsoft Office 2010. I keep getting an error message that the software needs to be activated and the product key code is invalid.After several days of trying, no reply from Sunshine E Commerce. They have probably changed their name and are still selling bogus software. Beware of ""MEGALOTS"" or any company that shows JUST LAUNCHED for their rating. Don't waste your money get [...] instead."
4,Very good upgrade,Very good upgrade. Commands are sometimes hard to find at first. Word and Excel both have added functions and commands.
2,Extremely Slow,"After installing Office 2007, I found that the program is exceedingly slow. Whenever you need to save a file, it takes forever to list the contents of a directory, and fancy new features like the reference mangement in Word take multiple minutes to display dialogs.It seems like computers should be getting faster not slower, and Microsoft has managed to turn my $3000 Core 2 Duo desktop into a very very slow machine. Thanks for all the bloat Redmond."
1,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,"After installing the Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007, I still cannot open alot of my emails and videos. I thought this new Microsoft software would improve my system but instead it has messed it up even further considering I'm just learning how to use the computer. I thought it would make things better not worse. No one told me when I bought it that it would not work with Microsoft XP. When I looked it up the web page said it was compatible to XP."
3,Not thrilled,"For some reason, when I send files to others, they cannot open them because they have the old OE. VERY FRUSTRATING!"
3,New interface takes getting used to,"I was perplexed with opening the new fangled container box. However, I had help in figuring that out. The software's new interface differs from the 2003 version which I use at work. What I do not like is that ""for non-commercial use"" is branded at the top border of each of the various components, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. I don't know why Microsoft found it necessary to do that. I have Corel's WordPerfect X2 Office Suite Student edition on one of my computers and Corel did not choose to do that, nor did Microsoft in its prior student edition. Other than that, the new design is okay and reminds me somewhat of the Mac version on my Apple computer. I like some of the new features. However, I wish I could change the color of the border from blue to perhaps silver because I find the blue too vivid for my taste. I have no idea what OneNote is supposed to be for so I did not download it. It would have made more sense to have included Access instead of OneNote."
1,MS ruined an already mediocre product,"Change can be good, but change for the sake of change is not always the best policy especially when producing a new version of an existing software. The changes implemented in this release are not fixes, nor do they increase productivity. They are simply a change."
3,O.K.,"I bought this product for my friends son and installed it - however it does not give an icon on the screen or in the menu bar and you have to go to the ""start"" key to find it (Windows Vista)...."
3,Product design damaged existing software making it unusable Miscrsoft dais tough sh t,"Installation of MS Office 2007 deleted the spell check function of my existing Microsoft Outlook Express. THe spell check function only is in FRENCH. No longer can I run spell check on my outgoing e-mails.Microsoft said tough. Even though it is their software, their programming removed the english language spellcheck. They must have developed the programs in ???. Google this problem and also Microsoft web pages I am not alone with this fault. MICROSOFT IS IRRESPONSIBLE."
2,What the hell was Microsoft thinking?,"Microsoft, what in the hell were you thinking when you were designing the user interface? And what was your trouble for not including the ""classic view"" option? I shouldn't have to work so hard just to word-process, for heaven's sake!Clearly, Microsoft has received and listened to the numerous and very loud complaints about the user interface in Office 2007, as Office 2010 beta shows yet another redesign in an attempt to make the ribbon look and act more like the classic interface. What a mess."
1,Getting worst rather than better,"I bought this new version thinking in an improved product, beyond the nice colorful icons and columns added there is not much that I like in this version, I use a lot of graphs but for my surprise they even eliminated the custom graphs menu, now to make a two axes graphs with columns and a line is much more complicated. This is a typical situation of ""just make a new version to make money"", same happened with Vista.MS should improve their products and not just make new a version to look like they are coming with a new wonderful version, in this case new version = worstI think 2003 and 2000 versions are much better.MS"
2,A product whose time has come and gone,"This program is so freakish, restrictive and over-engineered as to be a waste of time and money. My Office 2003 works better and cost less. I'm planning to switch to Open Office or Google Docs, which is crappy now, but has most of what you need."
2,Leave good enough alone!!,"Always wanting new and better humans are victimized by their folly only to get something that does the same thing in just a slightly different form. . Bill Gates and all other manufacturers know this and play it against our common reason. We fall prey to the weakness therein and then suffer consequences of only unknown proportions. Money changes hands, credit national debt increases and we all have something to replace that which already works or we can even get for free (open office) to accomplish the same goal. After all content is really what writing is about. Most great books and papers had even been written by hand!! BUT WAIT !! I'm getting this dizzy feeling: Must - go - buy - new - something - to - feel - briefly - better - and - empowered - can't - stop - clicking... (it must be those rfid chips in the new Captain Crusto's cereal I just ate)."
1,Stick with previous MS Office - It is so hard to use,Stick with previous MS Office - It is so hard to use.Hold unto your older version of MS Office as long as you can.It is harder to use compare to the previous version.It is very annoying to use this software.
1,This Version of Office is Not Permitted for Office Use,If I had understood I was not allowed to write paid work for publication on this software I never would have bought it.
3,Confusing,"I am usually really good at working with new software, but MS home & Student 2007 is really confusing. I don't like how the removed the Title bars. It's really confusing. It does look pretty though."
2,I wish MicroSoft would leave well enough alone.,"I ordered this Student and Teacher Office package omly becauase I had ""used up"" the licensed copies from the previous version Office (2003). My reward for trying to obey MicroSoft's license agreement was software that barely recognizable. They also omitted the Outlook Express that was part of the Office 2003 package.Now, I need to relearn Microsoft Word because the 2007 version is sooooo different. Had I known this, I think I would have chosen to download OpenOffice (for free!). It's interface is more intuitive and the price is right."
1,It did not work. the disk was cracked. and the key code was not vaid,It was total waste of money. The disk was cracked and the key code was not vaid. I want a repealment and total refund.
5,Good product,I have been happy with the product. I'm a basic user and I didn't need all the features that come with the other versions.
5,Microsoft Office - Great price,"The price on Amazon for the Microsoft Office Home & Student 2007 was the best available. Great delivery, great price, great product."
5,Buy it,Works great. MS didn't need to fix it and charge more. It does everything one needs. Don't buy the later one. Buy his before it disappears
4,Microsoft software,I am enjoying using the Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 software. I am very familiar with Word and Excel. I use it at work and at church. This software is really meeting my needs for home and church work.
5,Word 2007,"I use this product in my work, but it takes some getting used to after using Word 2002 for many years. Lots of improvements."
4,Office 2007,"I'm still getting use to all of the changes. I'm not sure I appreciate the difference. Be sure if you share or send files, others have 2007 or they cannot open the files (many do not). Option is to save in an older version."
5,Great Seller and Product,Product arrived new in box as description said. Works great and just what I needed.Thanks
5,microsoft office,theis product was exactly what i thought it would be. It arrived when I expected it to. I had no problems at all.
4,Microsoft Office Home & Student '07,This is a great program - worth the money. My high school student uses it for homework a lot.
4,Good product,"I think the product is good, but the tutorial is pretty difficult to follow. I finally got it right after a few tries. Alot cheaper atAmazon than anywhere else I found!"
1,"No, Thanks!","I'm using the 60-day trial. Word is bloated and extremely difficult to navigate intuitively. Compatibility with older versions is an issue. (Speaking of compatibility, don't get me started on Vista OS!) Overall, I'm very disappointed. Mastering this software will cost time and of course, more money. No, thanks."
4,Microsoft office home and student 2007,A great upgrade on the '97 and '03 versions I was using. Easier to navigate and better presentation tools. Haven't used One note yet. All my files were updated easily and it runs fine with 256 memory.
3,Microsoft Office 2007,"Let's face it people MS Office is a necessary evil. I was quite happy with my old version MS Office XP 2003. But a new computer bought came with Windows 7, so I figured that I would up my version of Office.I certainly don't mind when changes are made for the better, but this version is clearly for the stupid who can't be bothered to 'learn' the product. If you are used to using the older versions you will be lost for weeks trying to figure out how the drop down boxes have for some arcane reason turned into cartoonish icons. If you were an intermediate or expert user of an older version, I already feel your pain.Good luck"
2,Not user friendly.,"I had the older version on my desktop, and it was very easy to navigate. I could type what I wanted, and save it, and put it on my flash drive very easily. With this product there is an icon on the left that I had no idea was where all of those same things exist. I still have trouble remembering how to transfer my information to my flash drive, and once I have done it, I have trouble finding it again. I do not find this newer version to be user friendly at all. In my opinion, they should have left it like it was. Newer does not always equal better. The worse part is that you can not get the older version at all anymore. They should offer both for those of us who just want to do the same work on their laptop, without a bunch of hassle. Unfortunately, I did not have a disc from the desktop. It was already on my computer. Otherwise, I would have just put the older version on my laptop. I don't recommend buying it, but this is all there is, so you're stuck with it."
5,Microsoft Office 2007,Bought this Microsoft Office 2007 little over 2 years ago for about $99. Great buy great product.Does 99% of what the 2010 Office does. Probably don't need to upgrade till 2015.
3,Microsoft takes a step backward,"Microsoft Office 2007 still has many of the features we grew to know and love with Office 2003 -- or so they say. If you can find them, you can use them! Unfortunately, they also decided to do some of the thinking for us, providing multiple pre-designed headers and footers, for instance. But if you want to design your own, good luck beating the system!"
2,"Hard to do simple tasks, but cheap price","The price was good; But it took me 5 minutes to figure out how to open a file, and another 5 minutes to save a file. I've been using the older versions of Office almost every day for a decade, and considered myself an expert in the tools, until the interface changed how everything is done. Maybe someday I'll discover a backwards compatible mode that lets me get work done; Till then I'm returning to the older version. An annoying feature is the big tool bar at the top, I have a wide screen monitor, and space at the top is precious, I wish the tool bar could be placed on the side where there is plenty of space to waste. Although I'm an engineer for the past 20 years, it took about 10 minutes to figure how to open the box; I've bought puzzles that are easier to figure out than this product.If you never used Office tools before, maybe this would be an OK version to learn, (once you figure out how to open the box)."
1,Microsoft Office 2007,"There is very little new here. Everything has been changed, apparently, for the sake of change (and sales). It is nearly completely counterintuitive. It took me 20 minutes to figure out how to draw a line in powerpoint. The Excell popups in powerpoint are unlabeled and can easily be confused with each other if you open more than one. Word fails to shut down about half of the time without generating an error message. Worst software I have ever purchased."
1,User Friendly is a Thing of the Past,"This version of office is the worst version I have ever used. Microsoft has decided they now what you want and how you need to do it and that is your only choice. All customizability is gone. The ribbons are huge space hogs and force you to use 2, 3, 4 clicks to do what used to take 1 click. You can't remove all the ""cutsie"" garbage they added you have to work around it. Don't even try to make a chart in Excel. Charting can no longer be done in one process where you step through the formating, titles and location. Instead the chart is dropped right on top of your data with no titles or descriptions. Every thing you do in this version takes twice as long as it used to. Avoid this version of the software as long as possible."
2,download only,"I was disappointed with this purchase. A hard copy of the product was never shipped to me. I sent an e-mail to the seller and never received a response. Had I know it was a download purchase, I never would have made it. I wanted the box and disc."
1,One of MIcrosoft's WORST PRODUCTS,"The interface is completely changed. Auto-formatting of captions and citations is hopelessly broken and non-functional. Styles do not stay - Word reverts to default no matter how many times you change it. Randomly reformats document to new text/spacing/alignment. Text flow around images hopeless broken and non-functional.Basically - it all looks different, nothing works, and there appears to be no hope if getting it fixed any time soon. Save your money and sanity, buy an older version such as 2003, download the free converter so you can read documents from people who have unfortunately ""upgraded"" to 2007, and wait until the next release. Or two. Or three. Or for a competitor to come out with a functional word processor.Basically - this is the most useless suite of applications I've ever had the misfortune of owning. Avoid it."
4,Review of Microsoft Office Home/Student 2007 from Amazon,The product was what I expected. I had used the free trial that came with my new computer. I liked it so I ordered this product from Amazon because it was approximately $50 cheaper than the one offered to me after the free trial expired.
4,It was a necessary item,"Microsoft office home and student was purchased for necessity. My daughter needed it for school and I needed Excell for my business. So we were elated to get it and the fact it works beautifully. It was a great affordable price. My only negative comment would be that for some odd reason I can't access the tutorials. I actually had to search for one online for free to get an understanding of how it works. It also didn't come with a book, which could have been helpful. But all in all We are pleased and enjoy the product."
3,Got short changed,I have to say that I am really perturbed that I purchased this limited student package for my daughter and then found out that Microsoft is offering a MUCH better deal called the Ultimate Steal with a better bundle of products for $59.95!!!!
1,second-hand product,"At first I thought it was new,although it was second-handed,since it was introduced it was new. But I found that it seemed to be open,judged by the appreace."
5,Microsoft Student CD,Exactly what I wanted. ARrived promptly and in excellent condition! Thank you! A++++++++
5,easy to install,this product is userfriendly and easy to install. i would recommend this to anyone who needed something like this.
1,Item Never Recieved and no contacT from seller,seller never sent item and was contacted several times with no responsewhy are these type of sellers allowed to continue selling on Amazon
5,Office,"Works as promised, just had to add security code on program already installed. I have the disk and license rights to install on 2 other computers"
4,"Word works well, it'd better for that price.","I didn't really want to pay for ""MS Word,"" but I needed it for online college classes I'm taking. I didn't need the other programs in the package, but maybe I'll find a use for them some day. I got a great price from Amazon, about half of Microsoft's price. It still seems like a lot of money for an activation code: I had already downloaded the programs on the three month trial. They did send me a disc in a box about ten times larger than it needs to be along with the activation code. The ""Word"" program does work very well for everything I need. I guess I just like free computer programs best."
3,MIcrosoft home and student 2007,It is easy to use. Main problem you have to save as 97 to 03 file if you are sharing files with someone that does not have 2007. Some files such as powerpoint will not save as 97-03.
1,hideous software,"This is the worst thing since the Office Assistant animated paper clip. Forcing the ""ribbon"" on the user assumes that the user likes icons (I don't -- what's wrong with words??), and fills too much of the screen real estate. Nothing is where it should be. And what arrogance on the part of Microsoft to provide no alternate views, no ""classic"" view, just these piles and piles of inscrutable icons. Another oppressive, giant waste of my time and money at the hands of Microsoft."
1,Never received my item and they refunded the money,"It went to the wrong address and when I gave them a new address they refunded my money citing security concerns, when I tried to purchase again it came up for more than the previous purchase am still without the product"
3,SO-SO MICROSOFT PRODUCT AND IMPOSSIBLE HELP SOLUTIONS,"I DARE BILL GATES TO USE THIS COMPUTER WITH THE XP SOFTWARE WHICH CONSTANTLY HAS --LOADING ERRORS--- AND ASKS IF I SHOULD REPORT IT. HAVE YOU SAID YES? THEN IT TAKES MORE TIME OUT OF YOUR SCHEDULE WAITING FOR IT TO DO ITS THING.THE WORD SOFTWARE GENERALLY WORKS WELL-BUT AGAIN I HAD TO BUY A DUMMIE BOOK TO USE FOR RESEARCH BECAUSE THE HELP INFO WAS WRITTEN FOR GEEKS, NOT ME. IT IS SO FRUSTRATING THAT I KEEP THREATENING TO DITCH THIS AND GO TO APPLE.BUT, APPLE'S PRICES ARE ----OUTRAGEOUS-----SO, I'M STUCK FOR THE TIME BEING, BUT I DO HAVE AN IOMAGA BACK-UP HARD DRIVE FOR THE NEXT TIME THIS SOFTWARE CRASHES, AND YOU DON'T EVEN GET A KISS."
4,Different,"Seems to be a good program, not as user friendly as it should be. To many things that you struggle to find. But an ok product. Hope they made Office 2010 more user friendly."
5,"Buy Office 2007, Get Office 2010 FREE!","The Microsoft Office that I was using was 97. I bought a new computer, so I wanted to upgrade to Office 2007. I cannot live without Word and Excel. It was about a week before Office 2010 came out, but then I saw a special deal to get 2010 free. I think it runs through September. Amazon was offering 2007 for $99.99 ($50 cheaper than anywhere else) and just by registering my product by September, I could download the new Office 2010. I'm so glad I went this route. I saved money and I love both Office 2007 and 2010. It is well worth your hard earned money to buy Office 2007 with the free upgrade!"
3,MICROSOFT OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2007,Great price on amazon.com . Better price than on [...] . Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 does a decent job. Nice software for college students. I would recommend this software to buy on amazon.com and enjoy.
5,Microsoft Office 2007 Home and Student Edition,Great product as always from Microsoft. I love that I can put it on 3 computers! Thanks Microsoft.
4,A bargain for multiple computer owners,"My students use Office 2007 so buying this package was a necessity.Installation on three computers was a strong selling point and the""free"" 2010 upgrade closed the deal."
4,microsoft office home and student 2007,"It is good for 3 computers but if you are upgrading from 2003 product which I had, it doesn't keep your outlook and this product does not include outlook. When I installed it on Vista w/o a previous product being on there it worked fine."
5,Microsoft Office 2007 offers alot!,"Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007I consider myself, as being knowledgeable about MS Office 2000 and this is my first upgrade to a current version. There are a lot of improvements made since 2000. The new menus can do more functions giving more to do with any project you may need to do. It may not have all the software I had with the 2000 version like FrontPage, Access, and Outlook, but allot of this software is in this version of Microsoft Office. The Getting Started tab offered in each program has help and Tutorials to help teach you how to use everything. I consider this a great investment for anyone; consider this version carefully before going to the more expensive versions to make sure they have something more that you really need. (I used Grammar and Spell Check to edit this review.)"
4,good product-great price,I shopped around and found amazon with the best priceMicrosoft price were twice the price of amazon
3,Disappointing,"This was so complicated compared to 2003. Sorry I updated. I guess I'll have to give it a little more time to ""find"" the tools when typing a letter, etc."
5,Microsoft Office Home & Student,"I was pleased to find that there was easy installation and three licenses to serve my desktop and two laptops. So far so good, it isn't as difficult to learn to use the software as anticipated."
5,Great value.,The product was brand new at a great price. Quick shipping. Would buy from this seller any time.
1,packing destroyed....for what?,"I received the disc and paperwork in the packing noted in the photos. However....the package had to be destroyed in order to get to the disc and paperwork. I even tried the normally effective method of having my children and grandchildren attempt to open the package, but after nearly 4 hours I had reached a point of not caring whether the packaging survived and opened the package with a trusty hammer. So, someone explain to me again the theory of: ""we had to destroy the village in order to save it"" because I'm seeing a lot of parallels. I am not inclined to buy something I have to destroy in order to utilize."
4,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,"Good price & delivery on an excellent product! Would buy again, in a heartbeat, from this source."
3,"Good product, but not in love","The best part of this product is the ability to create powerpoint presentations. Other than that, the office, spreadsheet, and notebook features are pretty much the same as with the preinstalled Office Works. Not a lot extra for the money."
5,awesome product,This is a great product for students. It does not have too much on it that won't get used and it has enough where all projects can be completed. I have been very pleased with it.
2,Not Intuitive,"I first loaded wordperfect into my computer, but, later found it would be easier to have microsoft because of work. I was really put out trying to figure out how to access regular functions that are usually self-explanatory.I'm still 'picking' through what each button contains, and trying to figure out why microsoft seperated some functions from others. This program doesn't feel like a microsoft program. I'm finding that I use wordperfect for it's ease and familiarity for non-work activities. Even my daughter found it to be un-intuitive and she's very computer savy."
3,Too complicated compared to Office 2003,"There may be a few that want all the new features, but I think it got much too complicated, especially for Word as a word-processor. Would have liked a single button to push to get back to 2003 panel."
5,Microsoft Office Softward,I was worried that since I paid half the normal price there would be something wrong but it's worked perfectly and I'm very satisfied.
4,Mike's Review of Office: Home and Student,I find the above mentioned product very helpful in helping me get stuff out to my collegues. It is a very friendly product. I rarely find places that I don't know what is going on.
4,Micro Office Home and student 2007,"Since I am not so computer savvy, I did not realize that the product would be so different from regular 2003 version. I wish a manual was present sot that I could easily get answers to navigating my way through the program. I 'm sure that I will learn it in due time. I am having a few problems figuring some things out. I would purchase this again."
2,Microsoft Home and Student Office 2007,I have had numerous problems with this program and I uninstalled it because it was messy up my computer although I have Vista and that could be the real problem.
4,Eventually I'll like it,"They have changed the menu structure. I only purchased because I needed another license for Office. The previous version could access a scanner on it's own, this version will not talk to scanners and MS considers this a feature?Eventually I'll figure out where everything is, in the meantime I get to play hunt the feature and of course the Help function wants to talk to the internet every time you open it."
1,Disappointed,I had the Trial version installed on my computer when I bought it three months ago. I had to purchase this just to get the key to continue to use it. I bought a box with the works only to get a number off the box. I am disappointed to say the least. I should be able to get something more for my money than the number on a box.
3,I HATE the new LOOK,"I bought this to have access to Sharepoint Excel document editing services. I hate the new look and the lack of an option to change it to the classice 2002 - 2003 look. I believe it has all the features I used to use, but I can't even go to File open. I have to use the stupid folder icon. The only new feature I found so far, that I like is being able to sort by cell colors etc. I don't know why something new always has to reinvent the wheel instead of improving upon what's already there. Also It dosen't seem to like me keeping office 2002 Excel Word and Outlook. Even if I dumped Word and Excel my problems seem to be with outlook. I keep being told to upgrad outlook. As if I have an extra $100 lying around to further support the man. I suspect 2002 will no longer be supported in the near future.Still Amazon did there part. It was shipped quickley and the product works."
2,Bill Gates & VISTA strikes again,"This product is a step backwards - is does not even have the commands I use at work on Excel 1997 version. Vista crashes once a day, whether I need it or not. It also crashes and locks up when I dare to have multiple windows open.Another disappointment by Gates & crew - my next computer is a MAC!"
4,old version ('07) vs. new ('10),"My IT buddy agrees with me that there are still too many ""bugs"" in the 2010 version. Also for the price the 2007 version gives quite a decsnt bang for the buck."
3,Microsoft Retrogresses,"I was disappointed in Microsoft's new Office suite. Although there were some significant additions that made it easier to add graphics, the simpler operations seemed to be changed in ways which left users of earlier versions wondering. For example, one should be able to expect that if you click on ""Save As"" an opportunity would immediately appear to designate the name under which the file is to be saved as well as the drive. No such procedure is apparent. It took me a number of false tries over several days before I was able to achieve the desired result.Downward compatibility requires a download of a special converter program. To use a new or modified version of an Excel file produced with the new Office software in an older version of Excel requires the file to be converted first. This sounds like downward compatibility was just an afterthought.Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007"
4,English spell check is not supported,"It's a shame that Microsoft failed to support spell check for the English language. After installing this product, I discovered only French spell check was available in Outlook Express. I had to download English from a website. Good grief!"
2,Time to relearn Microsoft Office ? or not ?,"If you are a first time user of Microsoft Office or a current user of a older version with alot of time to relearn the software interface this is the product for you. It works well enough but having to retrain is very costly. I think this is a move from Microsoft to differentiate their product from the competition. Less open more proprietary. The problem is that the software user pays. I currently use MS Office 2007 and Sun Open office 2.2. My wife likes Open office, I have not decided yet."
4,Glad I bought it,"I am currently in school to obtain my Doctorates (oh the insanity), and needed to purchase the software for a presentation. I agonized over buying it, after all there are several different levels of this same system. I have Microsoft works on my computer and was worried that there would be some strange over load and my computer would disintegrate. I called a tech who confirmed it wouldn't and I purchased. I am so glad I did. The utility, ease of use and variety made my presentation feel less like work! I would definitely recommend this software for purchase."
2,I Hate this new version,They have changed the interface in a way that has now taken me hours to figure out how to make something work. I have used Office for years with great success and some design genius at Microsoft has changed the interface in a way that so confusing. The wheel was working and they re-invented it. NOT HELPFUL AT ALL!
1,disappointment in being an idiot and buying a new version,"Just to mention, didnt' realize this was 2007, installed it and don't know how to use it...hate Microsoft!!!! Sick of them changing stuff so much that you have to go to school to use something you've been using since 1998!!!! So...I bought a 2000 version. When did America start allowing monopolies again? I thought that was a thing of the past???"
3,the guy at office depot was right,"Registering software is a good idea, but MS doesn't make it easy. I never got mine registered so I dock it by one star. Often on power up it tries to reconfigure itself/I have to abort. Since WORD has become a defacto standard, one cannot live without it, and it is better than the prior version of Word. Neither have I been able to get the save as Pdf file option to work. I think it is overpriced, but what can you do? It does have one nice feature allowing conversion of 07 filesto older versions, Since I find many are not upgrading, this is important. overall a mixed bag..."
1,magnavox vcr-dvd,Ruined 2 of my vcr tapes. Defective. Cost me $27.00 to ship back. What a rip off.Al
1,microsoft office home and student 2007,"The company who sold me this product they stole my money,because I never received, this is my worst experience"
1,avoid this item,"I bought a new computer with Vista premium home edition (another mistake) so I got this for my daughter and myself to work with. I spend at least 5 minutes trying to get Word to open each time I access it. I click on it and it spins, then when it quits spinning, it runs a virus scan. When the program finally lets me access it, I spend an inordinate amount of time trying to find what I am looking for. I have better things to do than sit here and wait for a program to open up for me to use it. It is a pretty looking program but the older versions of Office are much better. My computer has plenty of power so that isn't an issue with this disaster. Just stick with Office 2003 and with Windows XP."
1,Hardly an Improvement,"This product was a great disappointment. The documents it generates cannot be read by anyone who has an earlier version of Word. It takes a time-wasting workaround to create a comprehensible document. It takes much longer to launch than previous versions of Word. Unless you have Windows Vista, you can't launch it from your start bar; you must go to My Documents and click on ""New."" Don't waste your money."
3,vista problems,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM TO ""CORRECT"" PROBLEMS WITH MY OFFICE XP SOFTWARE. MAINLY OUTLOOK EXPRESS KEPT CRASHING WITH VISTA AND MICROSOFT APPARENTLY DOESNT WANT TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THEIRANSWER WAS UPGRADE FROM OFFICE XP TO OFFICE 2007. THE PROBLEM IS .... AFTER RECEIVING THIS EDITION OF OFFICE 2007 I FIND THAT OUTLOOK IS NOT PPART OF THE BUNDLE . WHAT A GYP."
1,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,"... I never received this product ... I sent 4 different messages to Charlotte Software, and your feedback system sent me copies of each ... I received no response them ... I know my shipping address is correct, because I have subsequently ordered and received two computer related items from Amazon to that address ... I notice that Charlotte Software was a new supplier, and had not yet received any grading in your evaluation system ... needless to say, I want my money back ..HK Ball"
4,Back to basics,"Don't pay the extra expense for MS Office with your college student's new lap top. Students in college and grad school need the MS Office basics of Word, Excell, and Power Point, but they get their messaging and e-mails on-line and so they don't use Outlook. This product has 3 liscenses, so the user cost is only 1/3 of the list cost for these Office basics."
3,A word about Word,"Had to buy it to work with Vista, but I prefer the old version of Word better. Too much to pay just to stay even with the game."
5,Microsoft office Home and student,"Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007I started college this year, and my children bought me a lap top computer.when the trial versions expired I needed word and excelle. after shopping around I discovered that Amazon.com had the cheapest price around,savings up to 100.00. The program was easy to install and works great."
5,"A MUST for Productivity and Performance, Required for the 7-Hour School Week","I got this product for as low as $80 on Amazon compared to $140 from Microsoft for the exact same software. The Student and Home Edition have the Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint that most people need anyways. I use Gmail for my email, so I have no need for Outlook. Microsoft usually does special promotions for students, so look for it at school specials. The full version costs over $250, and most people don't need the full edition.Buy the full business edition if you need it. If not, just get the student one!"
4,Word 2007 is great,"Word Office 2007 is a huge improvement over Word 2003. No more need to customize the tool bar, the commands are a click away. The control + whatever shortcuts still work, but there's less need for them. There's a much longer list of recently viewed documents, and it's much easier to switch from document to document. You can click from mailings to inserts to page layout, to review, etc. rather than going through the old pulldown menus. I even like the color scheme. I definitely recommend an upgrade to 2007."
5,Great Upgrade,"Even given the time it takes to get used to the new ribbon format,Office 2007 is an excellent suite of products that only improve your ability to produce professional and easily accessible documents and presentations. Do not hesitate to upgrade!"
5,Microsoft for students,Thank you Micrsoft for helping the student. Microsoft Student Addition is awesome. I could NOT survive college with out it. It has everything a student needs and at a better price.
4,Good scaled down version,"I use MS Office 2007 professional at work and when I bought a new home PC I needed an affordable scaled down version of Office. This version has Excel, Word, PowerPoint which I use a lot at work. I can now take work home and have the same version (2007) as I do at work and perform all the same tasks and functions as I use at work without the cost of the professional version. I haven't tried to use OneNote so I can't comment on it."
5,Nice Upgrade,Upgrade from Office 2002 for my daughter's school work and projects. Free upgrade to Office 2010 and 3 licenses included was the major atractor. Easy to install and does have the option if wanted to customize what is installed.
4,Great bargain,I bought this thinking it was a single license package. When it arrived it is a three license package which allows me to put it on all my computers.
1,I Hate It!,"I absolutely hate Office 7!My netbook didn't have Office, so I bought this software, thinking it would have the old familiar tools that I have used for years without having to think about the process. NOT SO! I can't even find half the buttons I once used, for all of the garbage drop down menus. What happened to the simple row of icons?This is so foreign to the Word, Excel and Power Point software I have used for years that I cannot do even the most fundamental things.I didn't want to take a class or screw around with the software until I could figure out the new way. I have too much to do.At this point I definitely recommend the free OpenOffice software. At least it looks more familiar."
1,Office 2007 SUCKS!,"I HATE THIS PRODUCT!!! Is not compatible with earlier version! Can't make revisions to ""compatibility version,"" everything's deleted when it's closed. Power Point doesn't have same WordArt options as older version, so again can't transfer. Means all my old ppt versions have to be converted & then are not ""showable"" on other computers with old version!"
1,Worthless,"I was unable to use this product because when I tried to download the product, I could not because the product key had bee used before. I was very disappointed because as I am a teacher, I need the Mictosoft Office to be effective in my job. I am also disappointed because Amazon has previously been very good about the products that I have purchased. It is my understanding that since it is computer software that I can not return it."
3,USED BUT STILL OK.,"When I received this product in the mail I was expecting a ""NEW"" product for that price. This was too expensive and the newer version is almost the same cost."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,"I purchased this product in August 2010 and it stopped working. I was told the product key was invalid. As for the ""phone option"" that is supposed to always work-----where is the number in which said phone option is to always work?? Oh and btw I got a print out of instructions instead of a cd or product key card...... that should've been my first warning this was a fly by night company. I emailed and no response AND I'm out $70 I paid for this. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER YOU WILL GET NO COMMUNICATION AND/OR RIPPED OFF!!! They shouldn't be allowed to even sell on Amazon with this horrible track record just awful."
2,What is going on with the updates???,"Since the moment I installed this on my Dell Inspiron, Microsoft installs 16 updates every evening when I shut down. Not 15, not 17, always the same. I have the strong suspicion that it is installing the same 16 updates over and over through some glitch. I am not happy about this part of it."
1,bad service,this person was rude and never sent out my item i order and when I e-mail him about it he e-mail me back saying he sent it and he not giving me a refund and I needed it for school so i reported him to amozon.
5,it works,this is my first time ordering software online and i was weary but it was easy to add it on my computer and it has so many features that i didn't know was available. I am truly satisfied with my order and with ordering from Amazon
1,horrible service,I never received the item and never received any feedback from the seller after numerous emails
1,Invalid Product Code,"I have tried to load the software for over three weeks. Each time, I am blocked by what is apparently an ""invalid"" product code. Please accept this as formal notice of my intent to return said product to you within the thirty-day return period. I had to open the package in order to access the erroneous product code-so I was unable to comply with that aspect of your return policy."
4,Great and cheap,"I tried buying this from a software discount giant haha, after waiting two months I found it here for $42.00 cheaper and I had it in 3 days."
3,Is it really better?,I like Ofice but is it really much (compared to the price) better than Office 2003???? Or do I have to buy it to make it work with VISTA ???I surely would not have bought it without the need from VISTA which is not fully compatible with Office 2003.
3,Had First Problems,"I had a lot of problems at first. The excel and the powerpoint was working perfectly but the word would freeze up my computer. So I was using my Microsoft Works until something magical happened. The MS Word 07 changed into safe mode, which allows me to type, prints, and do all the crazy stuff that MS does except for clipart. My best friend made me come to the realization that it is because I didn't have Vista programmed into my computer. That is the reason why it didn't work for so long."
3,Too complicated,"I am a long time user of Word and Works, I use the word processor, database and spreadsheet options. I don't know who this new version was designed for, and while many wonderful ""arty"" features have been added, the basic functions seem too convoluted for me. I am constantly frustrated doing the simplest jobs. For example, the only print feature I can find in this program is a ""quick print,"" that means I can't select my printer or any preferences. For some reason unknown to me, my ""Quick Print"" is currently set on the by-pass paper and I cannot figure out how to change it back to ""tray 1."" I think the MS people have gone gadget nuts and forgotten about basic typing and printing features. After suffering through the Vista integration, which was (again) a very rough transition, I think MS has lost touch with their audience. I gave this 3 stars because of the cool menu bar which is easier to use, but where is the printer preference???????? I wish I'd saved my $80."
2,Product Stinks!,"Perhaps if you would include written instructions on what all the new ""bells and whistles"" do, your product would be more useful to those of us who have used your previous editions. Documents that used to take me 3-5 minutes to type, layout, print and/or send now take 4-5 times as long. Why did you change all the icons and drop menus that you had before that made things so much easier! WHAT GIVES, I DIDN'T MEAN TO RATE THIS PRODUCT WITH EVEN 1 STAR AND NOW IT'S RATING IT AT 2, BUT I COULDN'T SEND IT WITHOUT FILLING THAT REQUIRED FIELD!"
1,Another Microsoft ripoff,"I was having trouble with my old copy of Word occasionally freezing up because Vista is a crappy platform. I finally decided to ""upgrade"" to Office 2007, thinking this would solve my problems. WRONG! I tried opening a plain text document so I could manipulate it in the new Word. The program froze up immediately and consistently. So I tried Rich Text format. What I got was a page of useless little text boxes that are nearly impossible to use unless I cut and paste them individually into a new blank document. For this level of aggravation I paid nearly a hundred bucks? I am seriously tempted to uninstall and go back to my old copy. This is ridiculous. Does anyone at Microsoft give a damn about the end user?"
1,buyer beware!!!,I ordered an item with like a month window for shipping and my item was never received. I tried to contact this seller twice with no response. Please pay(if you buy) with amazons guranteed money back.
1,"This upgrade would be too confusing for my dad, he's 84","Being use to the upgrades in the past, I find the new Office a little hard to read & not so easy on the eyes. I'm slightly above-average computer literate so it was easy for me to transition. However, I recommend to the individuals who are simple-minded (i.e. my dad 83) and set in their own ways, to continue using their older version of MS OFFICE. The newer version would take me months to explain to my dad how to use IT & he would most likely give up &/or beg for the original version."
1,wrong item sent,"i ordered the vista did not get it the seller told me she would refund my money, and has not done so yet. this disc will not even open on my computer, so thanks alot for just taking my money and giving me a worthless disc."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"I HAVE HEARD THIS PRODUCT WAS GREAT..I LOST THE PRODUCT CODE BY THROWING AWAY THE BOX ACCIDENTALLY..IS THERE ANY WAY THAT YOU COULD GET ME THE CODE, OR FIND OUT HOW I MIGHT GET IT.."
1,bought the wrong one,I have a 64 bit computer and mistakenly bought the wrong one.........even though Student 2007 was loaded into it when manufactured.
1,microsoft 2007,dont buy anything from Matchbee as i have just found out from microsoft piracy department that matchbee should not be selling any of microsofts software
1,don't buy,"The product did not work. Because it had originally been purchased by another owner, I did not have the copy rights to install it, so it was a complete waste of money."
1,Broken disc microsoft office home and student 2007,"The disc came broken and I have not been able to get it replaced. The sender said he would send an address where I could send it back. But I have never received the address or instructions on how to return.The sender later said I could download the product from the internet but the site he gave me was not operating.I am still waiting. Can you help,I would like my money back so I can purchase the item locally."
3,Worried BUT GREAT,"I was very concerned that I would not receive my order on time due to the emails I received saying that UPS could not ship and that FedEx could not ship. Not to worry though, I received my Microsoft Office on time and through FedEx. I am very pleased with the product."
1,microsoft office home and student 2007,"Last time I purchased Microsoft Office, Outlook was part of the package. I was very disappointed that it no longer comes with the office package. I waited a month to receive the software. I had to get in touch with the people that were suppose to send it two or three times before they sent the product. It is definately not worth the purchase price."
1,Returning item,"It was received timely and then I tried to load it. Windows said they had encountered a problem and would have to close when I tried to install. I thought that it was me or my computer. I finally, after several times of trying, even calling We Care, got a man who was more computer literate than myself to help me. He said there was something wrong with the disc so I am returning it. I am not unhappy with We Care. I think it was just a flook of some sort. But I do want my money back. Wanda E. Selby"
3,Caution,"This is a ""non-commercial"" software. This fact is not advertised or disclosed on its label. I bought XP to replace Vista on a new computer. It is certainly better than Vista! The new Word has some new features that are good, but some features are frustrating to figure out and ""Help"" doesn't always help."
1,Just say no to Microsoft,"Once again Microsoft reverts a rip-and-replace product instead of a backwards-compatible product upgrade. If you create a spreadsheet or word document with Office 2007 and send it to someone using any other version of MS Office, they will not be able to open the file. You will soon find out that very few people use Office 2007, nor should they. Save your money and download Sun's Open Office or IBM Lotus' Symphony. Both of these products are open source, and they are free. They offer the same basic functionality, and they are both better and more flexible than any version of MS Office."
3,Office 2007,Not too enthused with this Microsoft product. Liked 2003 better but it won't run on Vista.
3,My review,"Excel seems to be okay (not much different from prior versions)...Word is pretty annoying..the top commands/options are not only out of place (compared to prior versions) but are difficult to find (ie Save File As, is in a completely different dropdown, which I had difficulty finding). Oh well, i got it for $119 (less a $30 discount for opening an amazon account). I'm not too familiar with OneNote, so I don't have an opinion"
3,Microsoft Office 2007 Home and Student,"So far the product has performed all that I have tried to do with it. Having upgraded to this from Microsoft Office 2000, however, I find it frustrating that so many changes have been made such that it is difficult to find common commands that were easy to use on Office 2000. ""Why change it if it ain't broken!"""
4,Microsoft Office Home & Student 2007,Product as expected. Would have preferred a handbook for easier access on tutorial imput. Your Amazon service was good.......thanks.
3,Difficult to Navigate,"I purchased the Microsoft Office Home & Student 2007, believing I would have a product that was as easy to use as my Microsoft Small Business 2000 software. Instead, what I got was a program that looked so foreign to my 20th century brain, that after four weeks, I am still trying to navigate and discover where all my icons are to do different things in my Word program. Maybe if I had installed MS Office 2003, things would have gone better...perhaps a smoother transition, but I am mind-boggled at how differently it all looks and operates. It took several minutes to find my thesaurus, and the spell check I stumbled across accidently. Good luck to those who are in the same boat I am in...the proverbiel boat in the proverbial sea of software, without the knowledge to navigate effectively or efficiently."
4,Super Upgrade With Two Caveats,"Pros: MS Office 2007 is a wonderful upgrade from Office 2003. Usability is enhanced with the new ""Ribbon"" interface. I appreciate the ability to see live previews of changes before they are made. I also appreciate that context menus appear only when they are needed and that most functions are more easily performed. The new file format is far more compact than the previous version and document recovery is more powerful.Cons: Unlike 2003, Outlook is NOT included with this edition of Office 2007. In order to upgrade that ""essential"" (for me) program, a separate purchase was necessary. Scanning pictures into Word is MUCH more difficult; 9 steps compared to 3 in Office 2003. BOO! With that exception, I love the new version of Office."
2,"It's ok, but there are free alternatives","Office 2007 is a pretty big leap from the previous versions, which can be nice for newer users, but the attempt to make things easier tends to make things harder for those of use who are used to a more classic system. If you're strapped for cash or just don't want to spend $70-$150 just to do some spreadsheets, word documents, powerpoint presentations, etc. there's always openoffice. This is a decent product, but I'm always surprised at how few people know of the free, open source alternatives. There's also Abiword if you just want a word processor."
2,Good product,"I bought this product and had it sent to someone else. My neice called in a panic because she could not get it registered, finally had to call Microsoft for activation because registration key had been used to the maximum. Product working great."
5,A step up,I have worked with Word and Excel for years but the upgrades in 2007 are fantastic. No more hunting through the task bar for what you need. All at your fingertips. It takes some getting use to but worth it!!
4,Everything I Needed,This product is great i saved some trips up to the school. There are so much stuff that you can do on here now its out standing. The only thing is that you got to get used to it there are alot of things that are different compared to the last one.
2,why change now?,"I just find it incredibly rude of Microsoft to totally change where all the familiar commands are in these programs, especially in Word. I still haven't figured out how to ""save as"" instead of ""save,"" and don't really want to waste the time to figure it out. Maybe it is ""new and improved,"" but if you don't want to put time into learning an entirely new system, stick with an older version."
2,rip off,the 2007 edition is such a big departure from the latter versions that you will find yourself re-learning how to use windows and excel... and that just sucks. they moved buttons and options around (and some are hidden altogether!) so the toolbar looks like a big messy web page. i've had this for a couple of months and i swear i still can't find some of the old buttons/options i grew accustomed to. and when i do find it by luck it's hard to find it again later. they didn't need to make these changes because it actually runs exactly like the previous versions. so if you have a previous version hold on to that... but if you must get this one... we should trade.
2,So-So product.,"I needed a copy of MS office for my new laptop and Word and Excel are the standard at my university.Being a long time MS office user, the UI is a little tough to get used to. I'm not sure what the heck MS was thinking when they developed this version. Office 2000, XP and 2003 were logical upgrades, but this? I am not sure.Because commands are so difficult to find, the software seems to have ""much less"" functionality than previous versions. I don't have time to read a book on how to use the software so I am struggling while using the software.I wish there were a ""2003 or XP"" UI for users that want to use it that way. (There could be, but I cannot find it).For now 2003 is definitely a better choice, meaning I don't think that I would ever ""upgrade"" to the latest office."
2,Degree of Difficulty,"I had the Word 2003 program before getting 2007, and I find the new product to be a LOT harder to use and way too busy. The Home and Student edition should be for those of us who are not working in offices or are computer experts. It's taking me far too long to figure this thing out after being used to the much simpler version I had before.Carrol L. Fry"
1,"""Ribbon"" style of menus is a major setback","I wrote this review mainly to address the menu navigation in this version of Office. The few upgrades in the actual performance of the product does not offset the lost productivity of having to wind through the so called ""ribbon"" style of menus as compared to using the drop down menus. It is not just a matter of learning the new menus, but the lost time of using this new slow method everyday. While it is quite annoying when using all of the programs in the package, the frustration is amplified greatly when I use Excel because I have to use a wide verity of its functions and options. The more you need function rich use of MS Office the more it will slow you down. For this reason alone it is a step down from their previous versions and I hope any new versions of Office will at least give an option of using the drop down menus, if not I will investigate the possibility of replacing Office with one of the competitors' products."
4,Office 2007 Manual,This manual is simple and direct. Instructions and explanations are well written and easy to implement.
5,The Empire is Better,"I tried desperately not to go to the dark side. I was a big fan of Open Office...until I used it more and more. MS Office is faster and easier to use. It also has features amenable to tablet PC use that are seamless. I often sign by hand (on my tablet) and fax documents I create. Previously, I had to print to windows journal, sign, and then print to pdf. With the inking features built into Word, I can sign to my document ""directly"", save it as a pdf and then fax it with fewer steps, all without using any paper. MS office just works more intuitively than Open Office, for instance it is much simpler to set up a background for a slide show presentation in Power Point than in Open Office Impress.Bill Gates is my father."
1,Beware!,The copy of Office '97 I ordered from Amazon showed up with the last part of the product key sticker ripped off!
1,Stay with your old version if you possibly can!,"Everything is changed and not for the better! Very little is intuitive. It's like learning a completely new software. What was Microsoft thinking? I've had it for a few months and thought I'd get used to it. Maybe eventually I will, but meanwhile I've lost DOZENS of hours of productivity searching for the right button in the right ribbon to press. And to add insult to injury, the old formatting issues in the previous versions of Word are STILL there. New and improved? No, just new."
4,"Fast Delivery, Easy Installation","I received this package on the date specified, and installation of the product was very easy. Thank you!"
3,Big Changes to MS Office 2007,"MS Office Home and Student 2007 has changed drastically! In an attempt to make it more user friendly, they've rearranged the menu organization. I feel like I've had to relearned the whole software. MS Office doesn't make it easy to put your good old tool bar icons back in place. It's difficult to accomplish what were easy changes before. Some of this will likely improve as you get use to the new formatting.Be sure you program MS Word to be compatible with the older version 2003.If you really like MS Office 2003 then I would encourage you to delay until you absolutely have to upgrade."
4,Great product,"Excelent product, it has everything you need to work at home or school, at a very reasonable price. I realy recomend it"
5,Microsoft Office 2007,Thanks you for the quick shipment. It's great to have the software installed and working! Thanks.
4,great product; has some updates,Needed product for my college student assignments. Installed w/o problems. There are quite a few updates for software as well as others.
3,Microsoft Office,Not happy about the way it downloaded onto my new computer had to take it to store to fix and costs me more money
4,Good But,"This is a great deal on this product, but leaving out Outlook in this version makes it less of a deal. Outlook by itself is another $80. If you need Outlook, then buying a more complete package makes more sense."
2,As advertised,Nice upgrade of a good product. Still difficult to track coding to easy correct format errors and too easy to recover changes in the final document.
1,Very disappointing,"If you look at the picture of the item I purchased you will see a new box with the title Microsoft Office Home. I received a plastic case with a cd in it with no title, no users guide, no box. Very disappointing, have been purchasing items for a long time and will not again. It even said NEW beside the item.."
4,Worked in a pinch,Bought a new laptop and needed an Office suite for it. this copy came and worked excellent and covered till I could afford to buy Office 2010.
2,crashes on exit,The program works OK for new documents but when closing older 1997-2003 Word documents it crashes. I've checked the web for solutions and haven't found one yet. Apparently it's a known problem that many people have had.
5,Microsoft Ofice,I recently ordered microsoft Office and was very pleased with the prompt attention. The merchant gave a window of dates for delivery and the software came at the statr of that window. The merchandise was securely packaged and arrived in excellant condition. Thank You.
4,Getting what you expected,"I waited until I HAD to buy this (a new laptop and two trial programs later), and appreciate the price that Amazon offers it at. Word and Excel is what I primarily needed, although I would have bought a version that included Publisher if those were not many times as expensive. I find the version of word to be quite user-friendly now that I am accustomed to it. Excel is unchanged, more or less. There are utilities in the package that I have not yet and may never use, and wonder about other customers' experiences."
4,MS Office 07,"Great prduct forword processing. My only complaint is it should have MS Outlook include for email. I bought this for $80.00 on sale, so that makes my complaint more like for your information.Hope this helps."
4,Overpriced,"Looks good, works good, yes there is a learning curve over 2003 software. As always with microsoft its overpriced."
5,Microsoft Office,The price was right and the shipping was timely.It had exactly what I needed at half the price where I had seen it sold elsewhere.
4,"Great idea for homes with multiple computers. New interface takes getting used to, but it is better than the old.","I've been using MS Office for 12+ years, and yes, I was frustrated by yet another Microsoft ""change everything to a new place"" move. But I have gotten used to it now, and it is good. The new pivot table tool in Excel is much better, and I like the much-enhanced conditional formatting stuff -- very useful for more eye-catching docs.The best part -- being able to install it on three computers! Microsoft finally figured out that the one-computer home is an endangered species, and who wants to buy multiple licenses at big bucks per computer?"
4,SLOWS MY COMPUTER TREMENDOUSLY & IS PROPRIETARY,"This product is one that is proprietary over ANY document you'd written before it's application! Each document is opened with a question/choice as to what to open it as and it takes about 30 seconds to 'convert' them from the prior format to the present one. Each previous document opened, is once again opened, before opening the one you are wanting to open! What a pain! It also slooowwws down my entire XP operating system. I need it for Excel but if there was a way to have it without all it's peripheral impact, I would grab it in a second! Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
4,Lucybear Review,"I wish they hadn't made such radical changes in where functions are located and how the toolbars are displayed. It apparently never occurs to software engineers that the average customer does not find it amusing to spend hours hunting for needed functions. In the first week, I came very close to throwing the entire computer out a window in total frustration. As a teacher, I have very little time and I need my software to work NOW.That said, the on-line help function is very good. You will need it. The programs are every bit as good as the older versions of Office and documents can be saved to older versions which is also good. I have several emails from Microsoft explaining all the wonderful new whizbangs that I have not had time to even wonder about. I'm sure the product is improved and I will be even happier with it once I have an opportunity to figure it all out."
4,A Satisfied User,"I am a long-time MS Office user and have been long overdue on upgrading due to the pricing and some changed requirements for its use. Having said that, I am coming to appreciate the increased capabilities of the Office suite and am still getting comfortable with differences in the user interface to the functionality of the different program elements. I am highly satisfied with the reduced pricing and this fine product."
5,Highly recommended seller! Two thumbs up for shipping!,"I expected my order to come in about 5 business days at least. Thank you for the fast shipping! Brand new sealed in a box as described, I highly recommend this seller and would definitely purchase from this account.I ordered this product sunday, jan. 24 2010 and today (jan 26 2010) i received it.I just received the package and was very pleased so im making this review. Im confident about the authenticity of this product because it is sealed and comes with the product box, it's like shopping at your favorite electronics store without the hassle and for a much reasonable price!"
4,Pretty good upgrade,"THis upgrades your Win XP version of OFFICE 2003 to Office 2007. Simple to upgrade, and the new versions of Excel and Word really are cooler to use."
3,Microsoft word 2007,"There is no indication that the software I bought is a used copy, and I hope it is not. I tried to input in a second computer and it does not work. I will be checking with customer services regarding this.The product itself works fine. No complaints so far."
1,A very strange experience,"I have never downolad the Office 2007 but for some strange reason it appeared on my PC after I openned up a file from my colleague a few months ago or might be due to my regular Microsoft updates. Every time I open up my file, my PC will automatically open it in Office 2007 and requests me to purchase it otherwise I can not modify my file. Office 2007 seems like stealthly get into my PC without my permission. I am very happy with Office 2003 and really want to get rid of the Office 2007 from my PC."
3,Microsoft Office 2007,"I like the idea that you can use this product in a few of the computers in my home, before we could't do that and it was not fair, after paying so much for a product and not been able to use it in your own homw, anyway I have been having a problem with the program, when I tried to open it, the old version in my computer opens up, and I spend a lot time trying to fix it. It should happen automaticly if you buy a product that nyou have the promo, it should happened instantly don't you think."
1,2007 Office Home and Student edition fails on mail/merge bulk email,"Unlike older versions of MS Word, the 2007 version of Word, is unable to process mail/merge bulk emails. If you depend upon this function avoid Office 2007. IT IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME. An internet search of 2007 Office mail/merge bulk email will confirm the frustration more than a few have experienced. Office 2007's major change seems to be in the area of screen image/icon format. Once through the quagmire to learn the new screen images/icons, one will find the 2007 versions much like older ones. It leaves one to wonder: ""Why the change?"" (NPH Mpls MN)"
5,As Promised,The product is working as promised. It came in it's original packing and was unopened as promised. I would recomend this item and seller.
3,I rather use the MS 2003 version,I learned the MS 2003 version first and used it for a very long time. MS 2007 looks amazing but hard to find the commands. It looks very complicated to me and I do not have time to find what I need here. I wish I can go back to MS 2003.
3,Too much for folks who don't need much,It is Probably a fine product for the average user but for those such as me who really computor challanged it is way too much.But I recognise that the average user will use 10-20-50 times as much of the programoing as I and I realise that in order ot get what few areas I want I have to have more than I will ever use. (Way too many I's-sorry).It works fine and I'm sure it is a good product.Aloha
4,At least.........,"After much hesitation (and I even used ""Open Office"" for a while), I finally gave in and bought and installed MS Office Home and Student 2007. The reason for my hesitation was that I thought the cost wasn't ""worth it"" for one computer but was happy to learn that the installation disc was valid for 3 different computers. I have one computer on its last legs and barely working, one new laptop, and a new one I have yet to buy.MS Office 07 at $69 was a good buy (usually costs at least $79 and sometimes even more) and I'll not need a new computer (at a higher price) that has that program already installed so I'll be saving there. As for the operation of the suite itself, that's fine and it has somewhat improved features over the '03 version. I am a little vague about installing it on my external hard drive - I suppose that it counts as a ""computer installation"" but maybe not."
2,Ok Program,If you have ever used excel or word and liked it - this is not for you. I have found that it is so different from previous programs that it takes way to long to figure out the differences. I have also found that the compatability with others really is not good.
5,Microsoft Office & Student 2007,"I am very satisfied with the purchase of this product, especially the price. I am using every aspect of it. Thank you!"
4,Microsoft Office home student 2007,The product is very user friendly. You just click and you go directly to the application that you are about to use.
3,Buy new get used.,"Not impressed. Ordered unused, got used (in more ways than one). Key code was scratched off. Contacted Amazon for exchange, was simply told to contact Microsoft tech support, nothing more. Won't do this with Amamzon again."
3,"manual, book, notebook","Don't remember this purchase, don't think I bought this. OOPS! think husband bought this and we use it daily in our computer. Satisfied with service and program."
4,Home and Student 2007,Expensive but had to have it since I'm in school. Glad for free upgrade to 2010 version - took the sting out of paying a high price for a product code key!
1,RIP OFF,"Surprised Amazon allows their name to be connected with this company, not only have I not received the product, none of my emails have been answered nor has my money been refunded. After this experience I will have to rethink any further purchases using Amazon."
2,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,The program was not down loaded from the disk in a matter that was explain in the instruction. No way to find out what went wrong. No one to contact. Still not sure if completed correctly. Bad information makes bad input.
2,Microsoft office Home and Student 2007,"Shipping is fast, but the sticker of the product box has been opened. There're two scrathes on the cd disk cause cd disk isn't stuck on it's box, free-moving in it's box..........refurbishment??"
1,Slow service no response,The product I purchased on 10/28/08 still has not arrived by 11/30/08. I contacted the seller twice and still have not gotten a response. The seller is pumbj4. I am very disappointed.
4,Office Home and Studen t2007,It's ok for the price. Probably not as good as the Proffessional edition but you get what you pay for!
5,Student Microsoft Office,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007I'm very satisfied receiving a new one that works.
3,Not Smarter Than A Fifth Grader,"As my title indicates, I am not smarter than a 5th Grader. I find the new version of MS Office to be very complicated and difficult to use, when comparing it with the older version. I am still having difficulty being able to understand the difference with the way I did things in the older version. But by the same token, my two 14 year old grand daughters (who are the primary users) do not seem to have this difficulty."
4,Vista version of Word and Excel,"My first exposure to Word 2007, have not used it much at this point but it was very easy to setup and the new additions are good and easy to use."
3,Office Without Outlook?,"This is called ""office"" but doesn't have Outlook.Isn't this a deceptive trade practice?"
1,OFFICE 2007 (miss the ofice 2003),"I am not happy with the new version.No improvements. CAN NOT USE GOOGLE SEARCH IN OUTLOOK. I miss OFFICE 2003. You can download the GOOGLE DESKTOP but for some reason, it disappears into abyss."
2,Environmentally irresponsible packaging,Office is what it is - we are all stuck with Microsoft's casual disregard for millions of hours of macro programming and keystroke commands hardwired into our fingers that evaporate with the next version. But the box on this one really ticks me off - it could be a slim biodegradable cardboard box but is instead a large hard plastic box impossible to file and millions of them will eventually be circling the great pacific garbage gyre. Just because you are the 500 pound gorilla doesn't mean you Should sit anywhere you want.
3,ld administrative student,This program did not interface with my other programs so I had to take it off my computor and I am stuck with a bad program.
2,does NOT include outlook,"if you e-mail, and who does not, do not buy this product. get the standard version that includes outlook. i almost made that mistake and i am very happy with my standard edition including OUTLOOK"
3,Microsoft Office 2007 - Not easy to find functions,"I was used to the previous version of office (97 - 2003).The 2007 has the access toolbar a little complicated that confusess a lot the way it operates.I did buy the office 2007 because my previous versuion of word and outlook was crashing all the time. Probably this was a way that microsoft used to ""stimulate"" old user to update their software."
1,Shipment Confusion,"I ordered Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 from Amazon because it saved $72.96 due to an online special. The website would not allow me to put in my PO Box, which is where all USPS deliveries for me HAVE to go. It would only take my physical address that has no USPS mail delivery. I tried to intercept the product at my P.O. but was unable to. I contacted Amazon customer service and explained the situation and was advised it could be returned to me with the proper address. That did not happen. Customer Service then advised me I would have to re-order. Of course the online special, no longer offered. Go figure. I purchased the product elsewhere and will never go to Amazon.com again.Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007"
5,Microsoft Office 2007,Product was delivered as promised and at a considerable cost LESS than my local retailer. Thanks Amazon for great products at great prices!
1,"Why did Microsoft have to ""fix"" a program that wasn't broken?","I hate it! Cannot find files. They fixed ""6"", but it wasn't broken!!!"
1,Microsoft screwed up again. In Word.,"Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007The Excel is quite an improvement to its predecessor.The Word side left me to question, ""why did I buy this piece of junk.You would think it would have all of the facilities of the Word's old software and further be an improvement of the Word it replaced. Not so! In fact, it lacks so much that I will not take the time report them. I had referred them to Microsoft, but they are too arrogant to even acknowledge their screw up. That why Microsoft makes it so difficult even address issues with them! They are like IBM was in the old days. They never admit to doing anything wrong. They, Microsoft are too busy drinking their own bath water and singing ""How Great Thou Arth"". So Mote It Be!"
1,Disappointed,The software CD didn't work. I had to call the Microsoft hotline and download the program from the internet. Bad quality for a company that prides itself on it's quality.
2,Microsoft office,I feel it was the biggest rip off ever. I really thought I was going to get a good deal and it was the biggest waste of my time. I did get my money back and it took a few weeks. The person who was selling this item wasn't presenting himself as a good business person. Calling me dude instead of referring to me by my name which was apparent in my e-mail address.I've learned a lesson at not to buy a used product from someone you don't know. IF I ever buy from Amazon.com it'll be a new product. It only takes one person to ruin a good thing.Lois Walker
1,Excel doesn't excel,Office 2007 has many fine features but Excel does not function properly. There are work arounds but using it is a pain. Re installing has not helped. Not sure how one returns a product when only one piece doesn't work properly. MS site yields no help!Certainly not Amazon problem it is a Microsoft issue
3,"Same progam, new face","Although I have to admit I had a little difficultly finding buttons/options at first because the layout is so different, overall Word and Excel are pretty much the same, the changes I see I like (autoformatting does a much better job than it used to).OneNote is an awesome program! I would highly recommend it to anyone, and especially students! I'm currently using it to draft short stories, create grocery lists, file recipes, and keep up w/ my ""To-Do"" list.Where was OneNote 5 yrs ago when I was searching for something like this..."
3,Review of Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,One of the most difficult word products I have ever worked with. It will not accept some images that I used for letter head in Word 3.0.
4,Microsoft Office 2007,I upgraded from Office 2002 and there are many changes that will take time to get used to. They moved a bunch of stuff to new places so it will take time to find them.
1,Not useful,"This product destroys,rather than add to,programs I already had on my computer. After installing it I removed it,and I am not using it."
3,just what I needed,"As a student ""Word"" is a necessity unless you want to stick with wordpad. I agree with some previous reviews that it tries to think for you. Outlines and citations are a pain in the a@@. They use to be easier in previous versions. But overall it's a good product for college work. One of the pros is that you can put on three computers! =P I think u could get it at cheaper price at walmart. When it was on sale it cost $65... you pick 65 or 100."
1,Don't buy from them,"I ordered this item over a month ago. I haven't received it, nor has the company responded to my e-mails. The price sounds good, but if you don't get your item what's the point."
3,General Internet software review,I feel that the product of Microsoft Office is a very good one. I am using it primarily because it gives me access to the programs Excel and Word. Two programs that I have not extensively used before and wished to do so. Now it will have to depend on whether or not I actually use these programs.
2,Incomplete,"""Student Edition"" implies it omits only applications for small businesses, but it also lacks Publisher 2007, Access 2007 and Outlook 2007. These are severe deficiencies!"
2,Easier typing and better layout,"I upgraded my old Microsoft Word 2003 to Word 2007 Home-Student Version. I liked it! Features that were hidden and difficult to reach under previous version are now easier to find -keeping in mind you have to memorize the order of the new arrangement.Let's say if you want to enlarge the title or size of your fonts just go to the Page Layout menu which makes it a breeze. Spacing, watermarks, margins and indents are right there, including columns and hyphenation. You have about eight different menus to choose from and it is easier to find the list of previous documents you have used or created."
3,MS Office Home and Student 2007 edition,"I have not had a chance to learn or even find out the function enhancements of MS Word and Excel, however all features of 2003 exist in the 2007 edition. The layout needs a little getting used to."
1,NO OUTLOOK & NO RETURN,"The Home and Student edition used to have Outlook, but does NOT have it any more. And you can NOT return it to Amazon, whether it is opened or not."
1,broken seal twice!,"Although I usually get great results with Amazon, this time was a real disappointment. I received the first order with the seal on the product box removed. I returned it and the second one also had a broken seal on the product box. I went somewhere else to buy and doubt that I will get software again through Amazon.This item, by the way, was bought NEW and direct form the Amazon warehouse, so I really expected more."
1,Big Brother knows what's best for you,"For anyone who has been using Excel for many years (i.e. people like me who remember when it was called MultiPlan) - avoid ""upgrading"" to 2007 if at all possible. I'm sure there are some minor efficiencies that can be gained from the new ribbon interface - once you learn it - however, if you were just hoping to do things the way you were used to, you are out of luck. There is no way to opt for the ""classic"" interface. Microsoft apparently thinks that they know the best way for us to do our jobs and is forcing us to learn to do it their way. So instead of doing useful work you will waste time re-learning how to use spreadsheets."
3,"I Like Some, But Not All","I don't like how Microsoft changed the layout for Word, Excel etc. But I do like the new programs. I use OneNote to organize the information I need for projects. It is the most organized I have ever been and it is great to have all that I need in one program, rather than switching between different ones."
2,Much worse than prev. version; doesn't contain Outlook,"Why oh why did Microsoft do this? All the menus are hidden and keystrokes don't work. There is no ""File"" menu - you have to click a little round dot to figure out how to open a file. Keystrokes are not backwards-compatible. For example, in Microsoft Word I'm used to typing Alt-E, U for Edit/Undo. Now rather than undo it adds a U to my text. Very aggravating. The ""ribbon"" may look pretty, but it's difficult to use.You can install a free shareware addin called ""Search Commands"" from this website: http://www.officelabs.com/projects/searchcommands""Search Commands"" makes excel bearable, but doesn't help much for Word.Outlook is missing entirely. If you want Outlook, don't buy this version or you will need to buy Outlook separately."
1,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,"Too expensive. Just think, most people in America have purchased Microsoft operating systems which is pretty much a monopoly, and generally buy others of their software and have made Microsoft what it is today. We have spent BILLIONS. They still break one off in us every chance they get. When will Microsoft finally give the public a real deal.....YEAH RIGHT"
1,Going backwards,"Microsoft has blown it this time. Forget about being able to customize toolbars. Forget about being intuitive. forget about all the training and practice you've had in office up until now. Microshaft has hosed the faithful with a new version that ignores all the good ideas that had become industry standard until now.To eat up a huge portion of my screen with useless ""ribbons"" that I infrequently use is crazy. When I need to change ribbons and then scroll down a menu bar when before it was a customizable feature that I could add to my main menu...whew.It's a memory hog, slows your system and does not improve production. You don't even have the option of choosing a ""classic"" look. Wasted my money, that's for sure. However, support will probably soon stop for the oder software so we are stuck. Thanks Bill"
1,If it ain't broke ...,"I am a novelist and have been writing on WORD since version 1. Every upgrade I have ever made of this product has been an improvement until this one. It is awkward to use, inconsistent in function, and requires constant fixes to both text and format. I am seriously considering an uninstall. If you have any version before this one, don't upgrade to 2007. If this is your first go at word processing, consider WordPerfect. Someone at microsoft should have said to the poobahs at marketing, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""Frederick Ramsay"
3,Not bad...,The only frustrating thing was the product did not have a serial number. I had to call Microsoft and get one in order to install it.
3,get the bugs out,"I use this for school, writing essays and sending them to prof's... and I'm having a heck of a time having word 07 ""talk"" to other versions of word, if I attatch an essay and send it to my comp from school, I have problems getting it to send on to another prof.. I wish the bugs were worked out before purchasing. I'm not the only student having issues with word 07 and getting their work to their prof.s.."
1,After a few months the licence expire...,"I bought this Microsoft Office from Amazon.com, and after a few months the licence expire...so now I don't have M/Office in my pc, because the pc cannot authenticate the licence number.so bad and sad, I loss my money and time :("
4,Review for MS Office 2007,"This item without ""outlook"", but with ""OneNote"".It is okay for general purposes at home, we don't have any choice nowadays.The price is still acceptable.If MS produces another version between MS Office (pay-version)& MS Works (free-version) with more cheaper price, it will be much better."
5,Excellent product,"This item is awesome. I recieved the package, looked for the activation and didn't need to insert the CD. Since I had a trail version installed on my laptop, all I needed was the activation key. If anything I'll use the CD for my desktop computer. It worked and I now have all Microsoft Office Suites for my laptop. Couldn't ask for more. Product was as described."
5,great price and product,WE recieved the product in short time and it was all that the reviews said it was. We only needed certain parts of the office and that is what we are using. Will order from you again. Al at EDH Solar Electric
2,more microsoft ruining a good thing,"if the folks at microsoft would actually care about people who use software, especially theirs, they would stop producing software with huge learning curves. I've been a user of MS Office since its first issue in 1990 - and I still can't figure out what they've done to make the product any more useful to me in almost 20 years. Yes, it's gone from 5 floppy disks to almost a gigabyte - but formatting in word is still a problem, plus with office combined with vista, most of my pdf writers no longer work as they once did, if at all. very disappointing issue - i'm just glad i didn't pay 600 dollars for it, or i'd be furious. Message to Microsoft - IF IT'S NOT BROKEN - DONT MESS WITH IT. The old menus were intuitive and simple to use - i need to go back and get a ph.d. to learn this issue - if i didn't need this to be able to read things people send me - I'd literally throw it away - go back to the old menus which worked just fine."
1,Evaluating attempt to purchase software from isuntrust,"After sale of software, the seller issued as fake shipping notice with a nonexistant shipper, collected the money for the software and shipping from my credit card and did nothing else. After a long shipping schedule had elapsed and I attemped to contact seller twice with no response. I filled out a claim form with Amazon. In less than 24 hours Amazon credited my credit card for the software andd shipping. Amazon has earned five stars for their role in this transaction. The seller, isuntrust doesn't deserve the one star I gave them. Anyone who purchases from this seller should make sure their purchase is warrented otherwise they face the real possibility of losing their money."
4,Required to continue!,The MS Office suite upgrade is a required package in order to provide access to previously created files. To date I have had no problems with the upgrade.Amazon.com has always given me excellent service and quality products.
3,within expectation,"The interface is fancy, but not as user-friendly as before. I still prefer to the old version like 2003."
4,Office 2007,This product is a very easy product to adjust to. Adjustment however is what you will have to do because the basic functions are not under the standard menu as previous versions. It can be a little fustrating in the beginning but overall is a good product.
3,Office Suite,Order was delivered promptly and professionally. Quite a few changes in this product that will require some time to learn but I think I will like it. I have had some trouble in Excel switching from one sheet to another in a workbook. At times it takes several attempts. Perhaps that is a problem with my new computer?
3,Microsoft Did It Again,Bought product thinking newer version would add capabilities to the 2003 version. Nearly all the functions have changed ... have to learn what I was familiar with all over again.Scan a lot of inserts into Word documents ... no easy provisions to scan on 2007 version. Overall I wasted my money to upgrade to Office 2007
3,Fair,I like the software I received but I wish that I had ppurchased a latter version. I will need to update this version soon.
4,Office 2007 Home and Student,It is great for students to use and to learn but it lacks some of the things needed for a small bussiness office and office work. Some of the programs are a shorter verion than the regular office product. Other than that as I said it is a great tool for students to learn what Office is and how it works
4,All good,"I mostly bought the package for Microsoft Word, though I'm sure that Excel and PowerPoint will become handy for me down the road, and OneNote looks interesting. This is my first time using this newer version of the software, and there are certainly some changes, but mostly just with how you access various functions (easier, I'd say). I did have a little bit of grief with it doing some auto-formatting for me that I did not want, but eventually got it to go my way. I'm sure with just a bit more use I'll figure out how to control that better."
5,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 - Great Product,"Product came on time and is exactly what I wanted, needed and more. Recomend to everyone."
1,Terrible,Word does not work well with Outlook. Is very cumbersome and doesn't work well with Outlook when making envelopes from my contact list. I guess I'll have to address all my christmas cards buy hand.
4,Microsoft Home & Student 2007,"Everyone pretty much knows what this product is and does. Nothing new to report there. However, normally it is ridiculously expensive. I really appreciate the more reasonable price I got it for."
2,MICROSOFT OFFICE HOME AND STUDENT 2007,THE PRODUCT WOULD BE USEFUL IF WASN'T FOR VISTA. MICROSOFT HAS CAUSED A PROBLEM FOR THEIR CONSUMERS. THIS PRODUCT NEEDS A TUTORIAL/INSTRUCTIONAL MANUAL IN THE PACKAGE. I AM REALLY FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY OVER THIS.
4,"Great price, Great bargain!!",I was very thankful to find this software on Amazon for this price when I had just received an e-mail from the manufacturer for the same software but for $50 more which made me hesitant to purchase at that time. Thank you Amazon for being a lifesave!
5,Microsoft Office and Student 2007,I recently purchased the Microsoft Office & Student 2007 for my laptop and it has worked perfectly. It was a new one and it was listed here for about half price compaired to other places that I looked. I am very pleased!
3,MS Office 2007,"I was more or less forced to buy, because I purchased a new computer. It was a learning curve to figure out where everything I use in Office 2000 was, as the format is all-new. The biggest drawback is new document extensions (.docx instead of .doc), and they are not fully compatible. I guess Bill just needed even more money."
3,Good suite of applications..BUT.,"Office 2007 is a good suite of applications. The only thing that prevents me from giving it a top rating is Microsoft's constant altering the user interface from previous versions and, in my opinion, not for the better. I resorted to 3rd party add-ons that largely allowed one to revert to previous menus."
1,MS 2007 sucks,"I only bought this for MS Word 2007, which works worse than the MS Word 2000 I already have. MS Word 2007 messed up all tables I had put in 2000 documents; I could not copy playlists from iTunes into a document (very easy w. 2000); several of the commands had changed unnecesarily; etc. However, 2000 often give message ""... has encountered a problem and must shut down ..."" This only happened in 2007 upon trying to copy the iTunes playlist.My next computer is likely to be Mac & I intend to stear clear of MS products whenever possible.Larry SarnerHaiku, HI"
4,great new look,"While it took some time to get acquainted with the new look of MS Office Home and Student, I am pleased with the new toolbars' ease of use. I do not have to hunt for what I need. The only drawback I see is not having Outlook for my emails."
1,Makes Easy Tasks Difficult,"I used Office 2000 for years at home and 2003 at work. I decided when I bought a new laptop to upgrade to 2007. What a mistake. Office 07 makes what used to be easy tasks complicated. I spent the first few hours just adding items to the main toolbars on each program so I wouldn't have to go through the ribbons every time. I also had to reset the font type and size. I also miss the drop-down menus which made things easy and quick to find. After a month, I installed Office 2000 on my new computer. If I could still return 2007, I would."
1,Read This First!!,"If you are a student with a ""student@college.edu"" email address, go to Microsoft's website and you can get Office Ultimate (includes everything) for $59.99- Hurry the offer only lasts a little bit longer- I am so glad I saw it b/c I was about to buy this limited product for $20 more."
3,As Expected,"At least it is compatible with Windows 7 right out of the package. It loads nice and runs without problem. Nothing that is important to me has changed in the last 7 or 8 years. The look and feel has changed enough to throw me off balance and reduce my productivity, but it works OK when you get accustomed to it. More of an asset to the Microsoft bottom line than anything else."
5,AlaskaGranny,I run a Mac with dual platforms(Boot Camp) and it its working great for me. I can bring home work from the office and work at home. The office is a PC platform. Recommend it for any of you Mac users running dual platforms.
4,a brand-new office,"After what seems like forever using Office, 2007 has an entirely new look. It takes a little while to get used to finding everything one's used to, but it is an over-all good upgrade from 2003."
3,Microsoft 2007 Office suite,This review is still under review as this was a gift to my grandson for use as a student at MATC.
4,"Software, M/S Ofice (MAC)","Due to confusioon on my part we got Office (windows), wanted one for the MAC. We felt your Consumer support group was very helpful and did a great job getting the unit we wanted, as yet still not received.The windows version of Office was given to UPS for delivery to J&R; today, following their instructions for return material.As you may also be aware you ordered a book from ""BookFinders"" for us (author was Boronoski) . . . I suspect you will credit my charge card for the failure to furnish it . . . but I have to wonder if Amazon might not have had another source available from whom it might have been ordered instead of just canceling the order? The book ""the Ascent of Man"" would be welcome, should you find a reasonable source."
1,Illegal copy,"This was a ripped off copy of the programs. I was not happy to recieve it and was more upset I wasted money on this product. I hope that Amazon will police what people sell on their site better, especially if is something that is easily copied. I destroyed the copy and went and got the product else where. I also will never by software from this site again unless they can fix this type of problem."
2,buy standard for a bit more but worth it,"I was very familiar with word so this student version looks stupid because all the icons are different at the top. I had to relearn and some higher functions are not there. This version is good for someone that is NOT familiar with word already and wants to use it quickly for school stuff. If you are already familiar with word, then by the STANDARD version and NOT THIS ONE."
4,Hard to make graphs little/no instrucion,"No instructions on how to use such as graphs I couldnt figure it out for a report, No instructions or clear help."
1,busy mom review,"I had alot of trouble installing the program, and had to have Microsoft send a working disk. It didn't work well for me."
1,Not worth it,"It seems the only thing added to most of the software was the ""ribbon"". and you can't customize a ribbon. After Microsoft introduced 'personalized menus' you would think that personalization would be a priority, but the ribbon totally destroys this concept.Almost every time I exit Word it crashes, Outlook is slower than molasses and locks up other software while it downloads even small email. A few nice features were added to Excel and Word will save as PDF, those are nice features that I'll miss when I uninstall Office 2007 and reinstall Office 2002."
1,Never received,"I never received my product from this vendor, nor did I receive an email back from them when I inquired about my order."
4,Needs more software for the buck,I liked the packaged. Just a little disappointed with the price with Microsoft. Amazon was the best place to get it for the money. Ebay's sellers were terrible. They must think buyers are a bunch of suckers. Before you purchase anything anywhere do your homework.
1,Don't buy this here!,I never received this item! I never reven received a reply from my msg requesting more info regarding this! Extremely poor/ unsatisfactory service if you ask me! The only reason it has one star was because it was required to add this review! Too bad no one has taken the time to fix the discrepancy!
1,very unfriendly software,As I said--very unfriendly software and painting tools very limited.My impression is company want me spend all my free time with this software.
1,Microsoft Software,I returned this item because it wasn't the correct software. I was looking for updated Outlook 2003 or 2007. This didn't have any Outlook.
2,office 2007,"This is not a good office product. It has been revamped to look cleaner, but it is much harder to use and to navigate through then office 2003, which is what most people use. It can not be opened by office 2003 without a patch, so things that I send to others can not be read. I find it horribly frustrating and wish that I would have waited to find Office 2003"
4,Great Price!,After using MS Office 2003 for about 5 years now I thought it would be harder to switch to the 2007 version. I actually found it quite easy to navigate through the features.There are some great features that the previous version does not have and the interface is well designed.It takes a while to get used to where everything is but once you get familiar with it there is no turning back...literally!!
4,So far so good,"I ordered this software to update from my 2003 version. So far I have mostly used Word for schoolwork. I find the top menu to be confusing, but I am also learning my way around it. I enjoy the flexibility to write and edit in other languagaes, something my old version never could successfully do (I think becuase of a glitch, but who knows). I haven't spent a ton of time in the other programs yet, but so far I am pleased with the product."
4,useful tool,"This is inexpensive way to obtain Word and the included Notes is promising as well. Unless you need Outlook, this is all you'll need for most document management on your computer. It seems far more functional than Apple's ""Pages""."
1,Illegal copy of a Microsoft product,"This seller has sold a home-made copy of a Microsoft product, there are no registration numbers. A total ripoff to many unsuspecting customers.This was falsely advertised as brand new product. Buyer beware!!"
1,MS has overdone it,Office 2007 is just horrible. It has so many unecessary gadgets and it's all icons. Anyone using Word should know how to read and not need ten icons on the top of the page. And basic things like undo are hard to find! I think MS has overdone it this time.
4,Takes some getting used to but I Like it!,"Coming from Office 2000, this version is much more user friendly. I like the additional features - seeing formatting changes as you pick them, The ribbons with commands right there, the option to put your most used commands in your own toolbar and locate it where you want.Yes it takes some stumbling around to get used to where things are located. Well worth it from my stand point.Plus the new user agreement allows buying it without the requirement of having a student in the household. Also allows install on 3 PCs!! Finally a reasonable arrangement from MS!Mary Jo Gilbert"
1,A giant step backward,"In my opinion, this is a giant step backward for Microsoft software. It is radically different from previous versions, much less intuitive, and more complicated to use. I'm staying with 2003!"
1,Endless Frustration,"Excel 2007 will open my older documents into something called ""compatability mode"". This will work for a few minutes and then lock up requiring [ctrl][alt][delete] to get out. After that, my files are corrupted. When Excel 2007 opens again, it will give the option to try to repair which will also lock up requiring [ctrl][alt][delete] again.Bottom line: I am not be able to work with my older files without converting them to the 2007 format.When converting to the 2007 format, changes are made for which I have no detailed information and the new files cannot be opened in an older version of Excel without being converted back using another conversion program.I recommend office 2003 instead if it is still available."
1,Harmful,"Do you enjoy studying new software? Would you like to buy a big book and spend your time re-learning how to operate your word processor? Do you have extra time during your work day to figure out out to do routine tasks? If so, this is the program for you. Because Microsoft has rendered a great deal of your knowledge useless and you'll need to retrain to use this. Want to turn off grammer checking? You've got to learn how to do it again. Same goes for many, many other aspects of the program. There's so much here you don't need or want. Be smart and don't buy this product."
2,Office is not what it used to be,"I recently purchased MS Office 2007. It is completely different from previous incanations. It is no longer menu driven, and functions are recatagorized, making it more difficult to perform tasks. I teach Office 2003 and previous in adult ed., and I know my students will find this new version quite perplexing. Beyond the differences, it also does not work well with Windows XP. There are printer conflicts and it saves as a .docx, not .doc, so for other versions to read the document, it has to be saved as 93-2003 compatibility mode. None of the Office 2007 Suites include Outlook 2007. I do not recommend purchasing this product until the user has Vista, and Vista should be avoided until the first service pack comes out."
2,Overcomplicated and unintuitive,"You can get an idea what you're in for by visiting Microsoft's online training. There are literally hours of video about using each of the programs like Word, Excel. I just needed to update so I could save a Powerpoint slide in pdf. Instead, I find that all of my familiar programs like Word and Excel are no longer something I can rely on to knock out a quick project. The ribbon supposedly makes things easier to find in theory. In practice, an experienced user of the older version can spend 15 minutes finding a way to, for example, remove the underlining from text. Really annoying.I will no longer buy programs or new versions that are not intuitive enough to use without spending a day viewing videos - especially after having invested the time to learn the old version."
5,A Necessary Evil,"You have to love Microsoft. They have totally changed their suite of Office products, which means if you want to be in the game, you buy the new software. Thank you Microsoft. It's always fun to ""hunt"" for the ""undo"" button."
3,Microsoft Office Home & Student,"Quite possibly the best price you will pay for this, and for home use, it's really the best office package. If you're used to earlier versions of the office suite, this one takes quite a learning curve to operate, and the menu bar has drastically changed. Microsoft in their infinite wisdom (or lack there of) keeps making each version easier for those who have never seen it, and makes those seasoned users curse like a sailor for a few months until we figure out where everything has been moved to. Not to mention the fact that ""Why doesn't office come bundled into the operating system anyway?"". It's because the only true way to spell Microsoft is ""Micro$oft"". They know that Works is a piece if crap, nobody will use it, and then they can sell an overpriced copy of Office. Well the price here will make this bittersweet reality a little more easy to swallow. Bon Appetite"
3,take care opening the package-do not mar the product code on tape,"the software itself is fine. however, to open the package you need to slit tape along the edge (like when you open a cd). the geniuses who designed the packaging put the product key code on this tape, so that when i slit it, with my poor eyesight and not realizing the significance of this code, part of it was torn off. when you start downloading the software, that's when you find out you can use it only 25 times without entering the key code, which had been destroyed trying to get the package opened. so a call to microsoft help (hah!) and 25 minutes spent to get a replacement code."
3,Why not include Outlook?,"Office 2007 is definitely worth the upgrade. I've been working with the beta version for a while now, and can say that this is probably the best upgrade the suite has ever received. OneNote alone is worth spending the money to upgrade; quite simply OneNote is the best application to come from Microsoft in years. But why doesn't Microsoft include Outlook with the Home and Student version? Don't students use Outlook?"
3,Office 2007 Good and Bad,"This version is obtained for my son and my wife. Don't know if this is true of previous H&S edition but this version comes with 3 CPUs licenses that mean we can put in on 3 different home/student computers. The installation is smooth on a Windows XP machine. However, the GUI design took Office 2003's design further into the new 'Vista' Look & Feel. My home office and work PCs still uses Office XP. It had the traditional Office programs Look & Feel so that it was a bit of shock to see the new Look & Feel of Office 2007. BTW, Word 2007 saves document in Word 2007 format. Users with older version of Word will not be able to open the new document. If you need to share, please use ""save as"" to save in older word format. If it is just for reading, one should use Acrobat PDF files."
3,NOT LICENSED FOR BUSINESSES!!!,"There is a review that says this already but nowhere in the Amazon description does it say:THIS PRODUCT CANNOT BE USED (LEGALLY) BY BUSINESSES!Amazon, please update your description (I'm surprised that Microsoft haven't been in touch...yet!)."
5,Microsoft Office Home & Student 2007,My daughter needed this for college. It was a great price here at Amazon.
4,Customer Review,Item arrived in a timely manner. Takes a while to get used to the new 2006 Vista format - not for the faint-hearted.
4,Lovin it,I found the product very good. The icons are slightly different than the office version but easy to learn.
3,almost,"THE BOOK GIVES VERY LITTLE INFO ON EXCELL. I HAD TO BUY ANOTHER BOOK TO GET SUFFICIENT INFO TO BECOME TECHNICALLY KNOWLEDGEABLE OF 2007.THE BOOK ""EXCELL 2007 INSIDE/OUT. WHICH DOES THE TRICK."
3,Nice features...but WHERE are the command buttons?,"The added features are welcomed as an upgrade from Office 2003, but I don't enjoy the default command settings. Slowly I am customizing the software programs so that I don't have to go searching for buttons (or words on menus) to click and do what I wanted to do twenty seconds ago. My daughter similarly was left wondering ""How do I do ______?"" and ""Where is the _______ command button to click?""Twenty years ago I memorized many of the keyboard commands. Then clicking mouses became the norm. Maybe we are moving back in the direction of mostly using memorized keyboard commands?One of the nicer features that immediately stood out while using Word 2007 was that when I thought about changing fonts, font size, etc., I instantly saw the change of the screen without have to click for the change, see the results, and then need to reverse the change if I did not like it. This ""instant preview"" feature is nice!"
2,High Price missing key item,"I received the microsoft edition that seemed complete from my purpose until I tried to email my resume from the word and guess what the email switch is turned off for this edition, try explaining that to a possible employer that would like to see your resume in word form and you can only advise that you can copy and paste. It also seems too busy at the top for switching for the needs to type a simple letter."
2,Lack of Customer Service,"I wasn't pleased with Amazon because I could not get anyone to respond to my e-mail or phone call. After I ordered this product, I became aware of the offer to upgrade to Office 2010 when it became available. I wanted Amazon to tell me if I qualified with the existing product but got no response so I returned the product. I have since ordered it again with the added fearure that I can upgrade to Office 2010 later this year.Amazon lack of response did cost me money because of the return fee and the price had gone up since my original order. I believe you need to review your ccustomer service ptocedures.The Seller did a very good job in getting me the product in a timely manner."
4,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,"It's fine. Easy to install and works good. I had to get a new program because my laptop crashed and I had to get a new one. Since the program only allows it to be installed on 3 computers; I had originally loaded it on my laptop, my daughter's laptop, and my home computer, I couldn't install the program again. It would be nice if we could have used my original program on my new laptop."
1,"I expected a CD with MS Office on it. But I got a box that I can't even open, and don't know what to do with it..","I'm not ready to write a review about this product, since I haven't opened the box it came in. I may return it."
1,"NO product delivery, did NOT return emails","Ordered on May 15th, and the product was never delivered. I sent 4 emails to the seller asking the status and NONE were returned!I had to wait 4 weeks before I could get a refund.I will not do business on Anmazon again. Ebay is easier and more reliable!!"
3,Different,Takes a while to learn how to use it. You need to sit down and use it for different tasks to get the feel for it. Don't like the new default font.
4,Good Value; cheaper than office 2003 standard,"If you don't need outlook but do need powerpoint, this is a great value. Before, you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price (full retail $150 now). Office 2003 standard even on eBay is still going for $175 plus. This does not offer anything much beyond Office 2003 but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn. Also, don't worry about file formats. You can re-set the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of Microsoft Office."
4,MS Office Home 2007,"I like the changes aesthetically and logically. Still learning where everything is at, though."
4,3 licenses and free Office 2010 upgrade is real,"I was skeptical about installing this on three machines AND getting a free Office 2010 upgrade on each installation, but it's true! I already have 3 laptops in my house running Office 2010 off of this one purchase. It's not immediately obvious how to get the upgrade, although it's quite simple - just go to[...]"
1,Pretty much worthless for students without Outlook,I should have noticed before ordering that Microsoft had inexplicably deleted Outlook from its Office for students package. Unfortunately I didn't notice until we had opened one package and installed it and discovered that it had stripped off our Office 2003 leaving the student without Outlook.And I should have noticed that Amazon has a policy of not allowing a return of opened packages of software. So we wasted that purchase. We returned the second copy for credit.
1,badbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbad,I really can't give a review of the product because I didn't get it but I can give a review of the service. You say you can't deliver to a P.O.Box but you still send the package by US Postal Service. I filled out the form that listed both my house address and the P.O.Box #. You left off the box # and sent it. If you had put the box # on the package the Post Master would have held it for me to pick up. If the Postal service made deliveries to my house I could save a cool $60 a year.
2,disappointed,I thought Microsoft Office products were similar enough to be compatible with one another and have many of the same features. Wrong. This program produces documents that cannot be read by any other Microsoft product. It has few needed features. Bad decision to buy this.
1,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,I have been ripped off. The code will not enter and the software will be useless after so many log ons. I have no clue how to really get what I thought I paid for.P.T. Barnum was correct!This is the first time I have been burned thought purchases though Amazon. I was too trusting!Roger Howard
1,Alternatives,This is a crippled version of the full package. OpenOffice is a complete version. It handles the MS proprietary file format along with open versions.Open Office is FREE for the download![...]
2,disappointed,When our man instakked it we found that it had no email site!! We have to use our cox email and we hate it. You would think any program entitled home and student would have email capacity. We feel cheated.
5,A good upgrade for a familiar software program,"I'd been using MS Home Office 2003 for many years, but I couldn't get free support any longer because of its age. So it was a no-brainer to buy the latest version. The Amazon.com price was the best I could find online and the item was shipped free. No problems with installation on my new computer."
2,Microsoft Office Home,I thought it would include Outlook. I just didn't read it close enough to realize it didn't. I believe I made a terrible purchase decision.
1,Watch Out!,"New users are warned: You'll be tempted to yell, ""what the heck is this?"" when you try to use Word. Want to save something to a certain place? Want to edit? Forget it! You look at a document you've typed on the screen, and it's in a font you don't like - a font chosen not by you, but by the Program. Want to hit ""edit"" so you can ""select all"" and change the font, or the size? Forget it! You can't do it! Want to ""select text"" so you can ""change case""? Forget it - there's no option to do it!Microsoft should have given its customers a choice to stick with the 2003 version or this new and definitely unimproved vertsion."
4,No spell check for Outlook Express with this version,"Works great. It's a learning curve because the tool bars are completely different. Spell check does not work for Outlook Express, which I think is a cheap shot by Microsoft. I guess they want me to buy MS Outlook, NOT TODAY"" that program is more work than it is worth. There is a link for a great free spell checker http://www.majorgeeks.com/download.php?det=2952 to cover the loss."
5,quality service,"I have throughly enjoyed microsoft office home and student addition. It has been wonderful to have. Shipping was very quick, and it was recieved in a timely fashion."
3,Satisfactory,"The product was just what it advertised. I wanted Word and Excel. I also wanted Outlook, but it did not include it with this package. The new Excel was different from the older version I had on my previous computer. I had to do a little studying to learn the new way. Overall the produce is good."
4,"Quality product, good price","I'd been shopping for this software for awhile, looking for the best price.I found it on Amazon and with free shipping. The product was received in perfect condition and installed with no problem."
1,Did Not meet expectations,"purchased this in response to an error message from my MSN explorer telling me I needed to install it to get a spell checker working.Now I am told that the version is too new to work with it.Sorry, if it is putting money into the Bill and Milinda Gates Foundation it should talk to the others... or they should fix it.Unhappy"
5,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 Review,"Great software!Came in just the right time, very easy to use, makes nice documents. Contrary to others saying it is not user friendly, it most definitely is. I would recommend to any student."
3,Still needs work,"I own this product and use it primarily to prepare papers for coursework. Two rather significant problems I have encountered so far are the right click to check spelling and the header / footer feature. When Word finds a misspelled word, it puts a squiggly red line under it and the user is supposed to be able to right click the mouse and have a list of words to choose from. That is the way it worked in Word 2003. With this version, the first right click brings up document editing features and the user has to attempt to right click again to bring up the list of misspelled word replacements. This can be frustrating as one wants to work as fast as possible and having to repeatedly right click takes time.The header / footer feature still needs much word. I'll leave it at that.Over all however the ribbon feature is very handy once the user gets the hang of it."
2,"Yea, yea,yea.","If I didn't have to use this product, I wouldn't. There are too many reasonable alternatives now for someone who hasn't been trapped in the Microsoft fraud. If you are just starting out, go with Ubuntu and OpenOffice.org. Tehy are just as good, for the vast majority, and they are free."
4,MS Office Home and Student,"I have used MS Office professional for many years. When I lost my job, I found that I needed an MS Office Version for my home computer and decided to save money by purchasing MS Office Home and Student. It contains MS Word and Excel which I use the most. However the format is completely different and takes some getting used to. I found I needed to purchase MS Outlook because I definitely needed the calendar and ""contacts"" address book. If you need a ""down and dirty"" version of MS Office, this will work and it will save you about $300."
1,An Absolute Pain,"The first time you open Word, you won't know what to do, and the same will happen with subsequent use. A friend sold his Microsoft stock when he saw how complicated & difficult to learn the new Office 2007 was! I have a free copy through my employer for home use. I put it on my laptop to practice with. I ended up putting 2003 back on it."
3,Bitterly Disappointed - Can't Find Anything in Office 2007,"Ouch. What a disappointment! I am an enthusiastic upgrader and never fail to upgrade, but this one was a mistake. MS took a proven, well-established user-friendly interface and decided to make it ""new"" and ""different."" Bad idea. It is new, different, difficult, frustrating and a definite step down from the last versions of Office (2003 and XP). Office 2007 runs fine, but with the new ""ribbon"" menu system, one cannot find anything and some previous features and options have seemingly disappeared altogether. The interface is user-hostile and you need to click on ""Help"" to find features, once obvious and well-presented. Save your money; you will be happier with the last version of Office."
1,Catastrophically different from Office 2003,"I purchased Office 2007 along with my new computer recently. I expected the program to be similar to Office 2003, with some adjustments important for Windows Vista compatibility. To my dismay, Word and Excel have been catastrophically redesigned to the point of being useless. If you are a veteran user of these programs, you will find that many keyboard shortcuts are no longer functional. Colors and effects you are used to in Excel graphs are no longer possible to replicate. Menus are extinct in these programs and have been replaced with a horribly gaudy ribbon that must have been designed for and by complete idiots. The reasoning for such a comprehensive overhaul of two previously very functional programs escapes me. Obviously, the engineers have never heard the saying, ""if it aint broke, don't fix it."" Go to the ends of the earth to find a copy of Office 2003 before wasting any money on this product. Good luck!"
2,Caution before ordering check problems online,"I purchased Office 2007 and I was impressed by many features with Word and Excel. But be careful. The Outlook 2007 will bring your computer to a screeching halt. There is a function that synchronizes folders and it will lock your machine from 20 seconds to several minutes while it downloads e-mail and organizes them. The internet is full of very dissatisfied customers trying to solve this problem. I have been a very dedicated Microsoft customer but this has turned me. They have refused to address it and take a ""tough luck"" attitude. They will tell you your e-mail is too large but size does not seem to matter much. Use caution and do your homework before you spend your money on this."
1,NOT USER FRIENDLY!,"Six months ago, we purchased and installed this product on our computers ,removing the earlier version of the Microsoft office suite, with the firm belief that we now have a superior upgrade.Unfortunately, after two weeks of earnestly trying to learn and use this version we gave up, and removed it and reinstalled the older, friendlier version.Perhaps we will keep it on one computer, taking some time during the course of the year learning how to use this format and product design.So far, we have found the format to be quite different (ie. from the older version), cumbersome, and somewhat difficult to use.We agree, this version is not user-friendly!Norton Internet Security 2008 up to 3 UsersNorton Antivirus 2008 1 User"
3,Microsoft office home & office 2007,Software arrived in a timely fashion and was installed on both computers. So far the product is working fine. I had purchased two new computers that did not have the office suite installed.
3,MS Home and Student 2007,Had to purchase this to make the pre-installed program on the PC I purchased function. Another Microsoft rip.
5,Worth spending!,It's worth spending every penny on Microsoft office. 2010 ver is different than 2007 but you will quickly get a grip and will know that all the changes are for the better.
3,Microsoft Office Home and Student,Great Product but I wish I had spent the extra money to get the corpoerate version. The corporate version allows you to fax and email documents easier.
5,Great Purchase and Service!,This was a fast easy purchase and I love the program. I highly recommend this seller!
4,"Definitely different, but manageable","I only purchased this because I purchased a new laptop that couldn't run Office 2003 (which I loved). I haven't had any real problems, except that it is so different it takes additional time to complete projects because everything is in a different place or doesn't work the same. I'm sure, as I become more proficient with this product, I will like it as much as Office 2003."
2,Microsoft Office student 2007,"This update of Microsoft Office Student 2007 that uses VISTA doesn't have all the same features in parts of WORD, like even the option to save the file as a PFD file. I am not happy with VISTA and I am not happy with this update of MICROSOFT OFFICE STUDENT 2007. I am unable to use files saved in WORD, POWERPOINT, and EXCEL with other versions of the same software without much, much extra work, or rework. Its cumbersome, not user friendly, not compatible with previous versions. I am very disappointed with the product."
4,Great for students,This was purchased as a gift for my granddaughter who uses it on a daily basis to complete class assignments. Definitely a great product.
3,Microsoft Office Home & Student 2007,I find this more difficult to use than Word 2003. People who still have Word 2003 cannot open documents I send to them that are written in Word 2007. This is NOT a good thing.
3,its ok,i still have to play around with it but i really only purchased itfor my resume updates and didn't feel like paying yearly so that makes it worth the price i just hope it has all i needso i dont have to continue to buy more for the next computer one day
5,Office 2007 Home and Student,This was fast and cheap. Other stores had similar pricing but only if you bought the laptop with it. The laptop I got did not have it. Quick and easy install. Took a few minutes to download. Great way to go if you are a student.
2,New is not always better,"We bought a new PC for home and went with the new Office. It is difficult to use, a total change from previous office versions. I hate it. I don't even use it because it is so darned cumbersome.If you can work without it. Do."
5,Excellent,This works exactly as the product lists and was easy to install as the product arrived after my son left for college. So I just texted him the product key and he was good to go.
4,Review of Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,"Overall I like Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 because of the many different program features that makes creating new documents almost a breeze. This is especially true with Microsoft Word which is evolving as a fairly good program for desktop publishing. I like that there is a bigger collection of templates especially for brochures, flyers and other marketing materials. There is an abundance of features -- both old and new, but searching, finding and applying them often takes time which goes toward my final point -- I wish it was a little more user friendly."
5,Office Home and Student 2007,"Item was received on-time and as described. What else is there to say, it's a Microsoft product. It works as described and I can't fault the seller that I dislike the new features of this product."
4,home use of office home and student,"My wife's new computer came with a trial version of this and she liked it well. However, when it came time to buy the full version, it was less expensive to get through Amazon than to do it through the trial setup. So because of the costs saved, I went this way."
5,Administrator,I purchased the Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 disk and am most satsified with it. The biggest problem was just getting into the plastic container. It took longer than the install.
4,Microsoft Office 2007,"It takes some getting used to. The commands are not in the same place. Don't panic, you'll catch on."
4,Everthing I need and easy to navigate......,"I use Microsoft Office for both work and school. I had Office 2003 and this version (2007) is much simpler to navaigate through a project. I would recommend this upgrade to anyone who is considering it.The price found on Amazon.com was the least expensive I found for this program and, believe me, I looked."
4,Very Good For Quickstart,This product is great with lot of new enhncements which are very good to have for presentations. They consists of basic needs for professional presentations. I think they can be better by giving some level of customization for the user that will enable us to handle the product with more flexibility. But current version is certainly way ahead of all the previous products.
5,Microsoft Home Office,Product was excellent and as advertised. It was shipped promptly and in suitable packaging. I would deal with this company again.
5,Everything I need and more.,"This is an amazing improvement over The Office 2000. It's way more user-friendly and I personally like the home button. It practically runs itself, all you have to do is to follow arrows and instructions on the screen. Very satisfied!"
3,Office 2007 sucks when it comes to macros,I recently upgraded to Office 2007 from Office 2002 and found that the large Excel macros (visual basic) that I write in Excel 2002 take FOREVER to run in Excel 2007. A macro written in Excel 2002 that take about 2 seconds to run... then took 3 minutes to run in Excel 2007. I tried to return the software to Amazon but could not find out how to do this. Be warned!
1,We don't speak french!,"Dear Amazon,First, I'd like to thank you for being in touch. I had been trying to contact either you or the seller with some difficulty. Unfortunately, 2 out of the 3 videos (Roman Holiday and Breakfast at Tiffany's) were in French. As I was under the impression, that the videoa were to be in English, I would very much appreciate it if they could be exchanged or if we could be reimbursed. Please let us know.Thank you -Shira"
5,Run Me A River,"I am very,very happy with the quick,efficent service. I couldn't ask for better service.Thanking you in advance for future orders!"
2,Dot.Kill,"Arman Assante stars as a morphine addicted New York detective, Charlie Daines, who is on the trail of a psychopath killer.The killer shows us the deaths live via the internet, and Daines is out to get him.And thus this is the whole plot of the movie.This movie would fall under the catagory of a norish thriller. A few grainy depections of the murders shown over internet nothing substainal.If you enjoy a cop thriller movie then I would say give it a look. I wouldn't say this was a must have to add to your collection, however it kept my attention and the story line was ok. You could pretty much guess what was going to happen, so there were no real surprises.If this is the type of movie you think you might enjoy, I would suggest borrowing it from someone who has this on DVD, before renting or purchasing for yourself. Save your $."
2,Don't Waste Your Money.......,"If you are looking to see a good horror movie, may I say that you won't find it here. This movie was a waste of time about a cop who is trying to catch a serial killer who kills then broadcasts the murders on the internet. Overall, just not interesting at all. Boring and a let down."
1,Disappointed,"I really enjoy the Once Upon collection. . . However was really disappointed with this books. The stories lack substance and characters. In addition, I was expecting more romance in the sense that the kiss in each story would almost be soul shattering for each of the couples. In several ways the authors could have focus more on the reasons as to why the kiss is so important or how it seems to have affected each of the characters. Instead I got the idea that the authors wanted to rush to the ending."
4,Really good buddy body comedy,"I normally hate indie low budget movies but Who's Your Monkey avoids all the bad cliches and delivers an original story that is well written and acted. 4 childhood friends must band together to get rid of a lowlife's body. Sounds simple and like something you've seen many times before but this version, with its very true to life buddy dialogue and suprises stands way above the norm."
2,False Advertising,"I rented this video and was disappointed. I thought it was going to be a comedy that starred a trained monkey. The package is VERY misleading. On the front cover is shown a monkey. The monkey has a limited role in the movie-- and of the little time it is on screen, it is not even a live monkey, but a stuffed animal strapped to a guy's leg. Further, the monkey in the movie is not even the same species of monkey shown on the cover. A large picture of an actress also dominates the package. This woman does a fine job but has barely a minute of screen time in the whole movie! About the only true thing said on the package is ""Beyond Funny!"" But that's only if ""beyond"" means ""nowhere near!""This movie is a minor adventure, but it's definitely not a comedy. The acting is good, the story bland, and the DVD package belongs to a different movie altogether!"
5,Zero problems.,I bought two of these and they have worked perfectly well on several computers. The design is also quite attractive (I like the neon) and the size allows it to be unobtrusively slipped into a laptop case.
5,THE BEST!,"I tried every other flat irons... and this one is truly the best... it really is the HOLY GRAIL of flat irons. It works for every type of hair! I used it on my wet hair right after i took a shower and it still worked! Also, I was really impressed at how straight my hair was even from the rain. Ladies, don't fall for the other brands- they're all imitations!"
5,the best,This is a great hardcore punk album! Most songs are under two minutes in length but the aggression and power with which they are delivered is astounding. Easily five minutes worth of metallica in two minutes!Buy this album now!
5,Tremendously useful,"The book provides some great ideas that are important to anyone trying to get the most out of their payroll dollars. As CFO of a public company that has gone through a world of change over the past few years, the advice and insight provided in the Headcount Solution are right on the mark. I wish I read it earlier! I know the book will provide a great foundation as we go forward. I highly recommend it."
2,A Manual for Layoff,"The book's objective: ""how do you cut costs while at the same time keep your best people"".What the book tells you: steps to be taken when the company is in distress. There are seven steps and layoff is in step six. According to the book, it is as important to retain good people as to layoff the excess ones. The management has to identify who the good people are and how to retain them.What the book does not tell you: how to handle the head count issue in an otherwise normal company. As the company grows managers tend to add more head counts to cope with the increased workload. I bought the book expected to see such issue addressed. Including this issue would have made the book much more meaningful for every company wanting to keep compensation costs under control."
4,Police Combat Tactics,"I have recently viewed this DVD and found the information provided by Lt. Dillon to be excellent. The concepts are realistic and easy to learn. Lt. Dillon is very articulate and thorough in his explanations. The movements are demonstrated several times and from different angles giving the viewer a full view.(very professional) As police officers, tactics must be effective and simple to learn, this is exactly what this production offers. I highly recommend this DVD to any police trainer.Steven Hiscoe, (Police Officer, 16 years, RCM Police)Public and Police Safety Instructor.6th Degree Black Belt Can-Ryu Jiu-Jitsu"
4,Great summary; Great pictures,"I bought the book just after visiting Carassone. Probably half of the sixty four pages are photos,the rest summarizes Carcassonne's very long history for those looking for a great summary."
1,No No NO,"It Doesnt Say that the things are only 3 inches anywhere man. i got them in the mail and was pretty bummed out. i just started collecting mcfarlane toys, but now i know to check the size of the box, which i would'nt or didnt do b4. learning experience for me i guess, but i was still pissed off"
4,Nifty little collectibles,"The description clearly states the size (3 inches) of these very detailed and attractive collectibles. They're not really playthings, of course, since they are not articulated, and it would have been nicer if the figures in the series were available individually instead of in pairs so one could buy the players one wanted and skip the others."
1,a mess,"Badly photographed, badly scripted, badly edited, badly directed--this sensationalist exploitation of young Jeff Bridges is interesting mainly to see what extents of humiliation Burgess Meredith will subject Jeff to. So jaw-droppingly bad, I watched it through to the end when it was shown on TV, but definitely not worth the cost of postage."
1,Aye carumba,"This movie is so bad it is entertaining. In fact, this movie is just begging for the MST3K treatment.It features Burgess Meredith as a Chinese pharmacist, James Mason as a Chinese/Mexican criminal of some sort, and Jeff Bridges as a draft dodger hanging out in Hong Kong. It also features a seven foot Chinese actor and a monkey. The plot has to do with stealing US weapons secrets -- not that it matters. The special effects and dialog are laugh out loud bad. The soundtrack will make you want to shove pencils through your eardrums.Check out Meredith's biography to see what he had to say about this film."
4,A long time ago,"This was a read from a long time ago. I chose to visit again, and also to offer it to my wife who needed to read such words in a difficult time. Leonard Cohen is an acquired taste when it comes to music, but his writing is for all."
5,It takes a lot of ...,"It takes a lot of courage to publish a book of spiritual exercises when your name is Leonard Cohen. But then, wouldn't we expect something different from Lenny? Yes, we do, and that's why this magnificent book is offered to us - for consumption, displays, adoration, negligence, dull moments. Take Lenny's longing from the book and understand that being alone in this world is impossible because Cohen will always be there. Wanna have a new friend? Try LC."
5,Not for the timid,"Powerful, comprehensive, unanswerable scholarship. Read this book at your own risk if you would like to believe the U.S. Supreme Court has the authority to strike down the death penalty."
4,My 3-hole punch is now a 5-hole punch,I have a loose-leaf Bible in a 5-ring binder. I was able to turn my 3-hole punch into a 5-hole punch. I'm pleased.
5,Enclume DR4 Ceiling pot-rack,"Outstanding! And the quick dry wall mount fixture was really a piece of cake - so long as it lives up to its specs. There are no joists where this was to go so the quick mount was the only option. So far it has done well, looks great, too!"
1,Content Lacking,"The publisher sent me a copy of this book. And while I appreciate the gesture, I have to admit that I really found the content and presentation lacking.The book seems very piecemeal and slapped together, and not at all up-to-date. IMO, this books lays at the very bottom of the heap of web community books.Readers would do better to see authors Amy Jo Kim or Cliff Figallo for concise, up-to-date information on building communities on the web."
4,"Information, AJdvice and Good Leads","As a Community Director for a website that talks to/with huge numbers of consumers daily, I found this book really, really helpful. It outlined several different approaches to the Community challenges without espousing one way only. This is great because not every site has the same needs for a their community. The links to other helpful sources alone were well worth the price of the book. All the advice and information was useable, applicable--nothing was so radical or off-beat that we could not relate. It is now on my desk as a reference tool as we build and rebuild our Community porton of our website."
2,Merely Okay,"The bad news about these 300 thread count sheets is that the threads must be so thin as to qualify for supermodel status. This causes the fabric to be so thin, you can just about see your hand through it. Also, out of the dryer they are quite wrinkled. The good news is that the red border color that I chose did not bleed in the washer. Further, they did not shrink at all. I don't know how they feel to sleep on, as they are for a guest bed, for occasional use only. Just by the way they look, if I were to use them daily I would have returned them."
2,2-star Review,"I would not recommend purchasing these sheets. They are thin, not very soft, and they wrinkle easily."
3,Feel weird!,"when I opened the package I thought they were polyester, cause they felt so weird to the touch! After a first wash they improved, and I think the glossiness and weird feel will wear off with use.Thankfully, when pulled taut on the bed they don't feel so strange, so I'm keeping them. The color does not bleed in the wash, and the edges/elastic/etc are well done and do not seem to have any flaws. I've bought other items by this brand and I've always found them to be of high quality and finish."
2,M from Connecticut,"5 stars for the looks and 0 stars for the noise that these sheets make. I couldn't sleep first week, and considered to ship it back, but I've already ordered a matching bath curtains from Balard Designs, so I will keep it."
2,Pinzon Percale Sheet Set,"I thought that percale sheets were not supposed to wrinkle. These sheets felt good, but when I washed them, they wrinkled terribly! I couldn't even iron the wrinkles out. I would not buy these again."
4,good quality for the price,This set is very beautiful and light but still resistant. I have washed it many times already and looks like new. I would recommend it specially for the summer.
1,Fell Apart in the wash,One of the pillow cases fell apart in the first wash -- came out shreeded and with holes liberally throughout. WORTHELESS!
3,Slick down home popsters,"Despite their exotic name, the Ozark Mountain Daredevils have a sound that is closer to, say, Elton John than fellow southern rock pioneers such as Lynyrd Skynyrd or The Allman Brothers. They had a brief run of success back in the mid 70s, built upon a couple of massive hits. ""Jackie Blue"" is an excellent piece of pop songwriting and easilly the best song the band ever produced. ""If You Want to Get to Heaven"" proclaims that you have to ""raise a little Hell,"" but does so in such a slickly smooth pop manner that you wonder if they're really serious. There are a couple of other well written songs like ""Following the Way that I Feel,"" but by the second half of this album you've already reached some rather dull dated filler material. OMD did not record enough good songs to fill up even a single disc collection. Nevertheless, the highlights of their career are here for anyone who is still interested."
4,Not a Bad start,"This book is a good start for perhaps someone that knows nothing of Digital photography. A lot of time is spent on the types of cameras and how to set up a shoot. I would have liked to see more information on actually working with the resulting photos.There are examples of this, but it would have been nice to have more focus on it."
1,It's not multicultural color at all !,Better to buy regular 24 colored pencils.Sargent Art 22-7208 Colors of My Friends 8 ct Multicultural Colored Pencil SetOR Finetec Skin Tone Pencil Set of 15 Colors has more real multicultural colors.
3,May not be worth buying,"Read my review about this product but in crayon form. I would add one caveat to my other review that I don't think Crayola makes 64 color pencil packs from which to choose the skin tones so, if you want pencils, it might be worth it."
1,Major disappointment,"I bought this expecting to see some material not previously released. Instead, the CD contained songs that you find on the Benny Hill DVD's. The accompanying DVD is a waste of time and money. A large part of it is supposedly from a VHS tape, but it looks like it was shot by some amateur using the lowest grade of tape. Overall, I'd recommend saving your money and avoiding this obvious attempt to exploit Benny Hill's popularity."
2,One Other Thing . . .,". . . the audio CD, contrary to what's asserted on the back cover, did see a prior release, as ""Benny Hill . . . The Best Of."" Only as on here, the opening and closing ""Yakety Sax"" aren't included (the original CD had 16 tracks, as opposed to the 14 on this set). Get the original CD instead of this for that. Even his New York special, as lackluster as it was in spots, is an improvement over the video footage offered here."
5,What a delight,This Herb Albert CD is definitely that. Always great to listen to his music again. One of my favorite CD's of Mr. Alberts
5,Really Fun,"I'm 38, and thanks to my Dad, I have this album permanently etched into my brain. But as a kid, I never minded when he played it over and over. This stuff was good!!!After all these years, it is still great stuff. Herb and the TJB had a positively unique sound that just makes you want to get in your car and cruise some scenic road, right foot on the gas and left foot tapping along with the beat.This was his best-selling album and my personal favorite. And you have to love the ""food"" theme of all of the songs!"
5,Great stuff,What a trip back in time! I remember this Album(YES vinyl)and it's cover from when I was a kid. I loved the music then and it is still some of the best. A must have.
4,a trip back in time,"I had the same item as a 33 LP purchased in Canada in 1966, but had not heard it for over 30 years.When I slid the CD into the player it was just like being flown back in time.To me this is probabily the best of Herb's releases.Great relaxing music."
5,LOVE IT,The remastered version of this album makes the music sound so new and so fresh. I've been listening to it for days. This band is so on point that it's SICK!
1,"Awesome album, Terrible remaster!","I was excited to have the TJ Brass on CD and remastered. Unfortunately, there is so much tape hiss that it interupts listening to the music. It is close to the old cassette days, so if you like tape hiss or can't hear it this is the set to get. Otherwise, wait for a quality remaster!"
5,Whipped Cream 40th Anniv. - Herb Alpert,Great album![ASIN:B0007MRXUQ Whipped Cream & Other Delights (40th Anniversary Edition)]]
2,Didn't Have the Song I Wanted,"When I looked for the song ""Rise"" on Amazon it showed this album...so I bought it, but the song it's on there :( The album is ok, and arrived on time as promised."
5,Whipped Cream Nostalgia,"I bought this album when it was new. I loved Herb Alpert's music, but the young Dolores Erickson on the cover was also a plus! It looks like ""whipped cream"" covering her, but it is actually shaving cream (whipped cream melts too fast according to the photographer!) I lost track of this album many years ago and decided to buy another copy, but on CD this time, when I read in the Seattle Times that Dolores JUST TURNED 76 ! Make you feel old (like me) guys?"
4,An Insturmental classic.,"An insturmental classic,everyone of the tunes.I have really enjoyed ""A Taste Of Honey"",""Love Potion Number 9"" and the title track,""Whipped Cream"".I can't really describe in words the title track running through my mind right now,one has to listen to this reissued compact disk."
5,Me Too!,"Me too! That really sums up my experience with this album, because, like almost everyone else, it brings back great memories of my childhood. It was released the year before I was born, and even before I was old enough to stand, my dad used to dance to it with me. ""A Taste of Honey"" and the title track were my favorites."
4,One concern,"I agree that this is a great classic. This was the first LP I ever purchased, and I attribute much of the reason I became a trumpet player to Herb and this album. Many of these tunes are on a tape that I keep permanentaly in my car, and listen to regularly. Even when I practice I often go back to TJB songbooks and try to mimic the Alpert sound. The only problem I have with the CD, is that I was really hoping they would have corrected the distortion on 'Lollipops & Roses'. The LP has that track so close to the epicenter that tracking becomes a problem and I could never get a clean copy. When making the CD A&M must have used a master recording from an LP. Strange."
5,Love the music-boys loved the jacket cover!,"I grew up listening to Herb Albert and was very happy to find this CD! I love the ""food"" music and my teen boys just love the picture on the jacket cover! The CD came with a small poster and two of them are fighting over who gets to put it up in their room. For every jazz music lover this CD is a must!"
2,Classic Herb Alpert tunes :-) poor sound quality :-(,"Herb Alpert's ""food"" CD is a timeless classic. This is one of the best loved instrumental albums of the 60's. If you decide to add Herb Alpert to your collection, this, and 'South Of The Border', would be excellent choices.However, as in many [most?] CDs, this release suffers from major bass-shyness. OK, that's probably being too kind. There really isn't anything here below about 200 hertz! I know from the original releases of this recording, that the bottom end was excellent. What happened here: I can't say. Just know that a portion of the music is missing."
5,Great Classics!,"Getting passed the wonderful cover...there are a lot of old classics in this CD. I hadn't heard Herb Alpert in quite a while. I had forgotten how crisp his music was. Excellent harmonies and depth. Buy it and you can remember some great music, too!"
5,Amazing Oracle performance book !,"I bought this book in order to improve my skills in performance tuning and I have to say that it exceeds my expectations. All Oracle events are described with their common causes and actions to take in order to reduce them... Great work... So a big thank for that book which will make every DBA a much better one !Also, I would like to thank you the Author (K. Deshpande) on replying for my queries...Regards,L."
2,"Full of Bias, Lacking in Facts","This work was written mainly by outsiders to Orthodoxy who apparently didn't do their homework.Some of the articles are factual and unbiased; unfortunately, some are not and are likely to lead the uninitiated researcher down the unfortunate road of church politics. I won't go too far in detail on this matter, but especially in the area of investigating various Orthodox jurisdictions, this book is hopelessly prejudicial."
5,Will the twins be initiated?,"In this book the twins are going through their initiation period and their powers have taken a leap but their uncle has something up his sleeve. Will they figure it out? Meanwhile Ileana and Miranda, the twins mother, have to watch the twins without helping them. Also the twins break a long time curse for good. How did they do that? Read the book yourself and find out. I can't wait for the Disney movie to come out!"
5,ahhh its out!!,ahh i cant believe its out! its gunna be sooo good! it wasnt supposed to b out for a long time! same with the new Avalon book ALL'S FAIRY LOVE AND WAR! i dont have to read it cuz it gunna be good anyway!!! buy buy buy buy it!!!
1,Awful,"This is everything I hate about bad comics - unintelligent, forced, unbelievable, and boring. I'm a huge fan of Millar's Ultimates, which I highly recommend, but this is not even in the same ballpark. I thought I was a Terry Dodson fan, but after wading through page after page, I just started getting angry. I see the good reviews and obviously some people like it, but it's just not for me. Some of my faves: Alan Moore, Frank Miller, Y The Last Man, Fables, Ultimates, All Star Superman. If you have the same likes as me, you probably won't like this book."
4,"Great Art, Story was a bit strange","The art alone is worth the price of this book. The story is not bad, but could get a bit too much for me at times. All in all just buy the book and you will not be disappointed overall. The story really just depends on your taste, if you dont like the art then you need to get a catscan."
3,A new generation of Variation V,"I've had Dansk Variation V for 35 years, including pieces manufactured in Denmark, Finland, Japan, Korea, and China. There are slight but real differences in the shapes of each utensil type (spoon, fork, etc) from country to country of manufacture. These latest sets are made in China; the polish is higher, and the molds are clearly different. If you have acquired this pattern in recent years you may not notice; if you have originals, you will. It's a bit too soon to tell how well these pieces will ""age"" (stand up to the dishwasher, etc). Otherwise, they blend in with the older pieces except when lined up with like items (ie, spoons, forks, etc). For the price, these are a great value."
2,Dansk Variation V flatware,"I ordered some individual pieces recently to add to my set which I have had since 1970. Actually, I only needed the teaspoons. Well, I returned the teaspoons and kept the rest. The forks are a different shape and the knives had spots after one washing but I decided to keep them anyway. The stainless is not up to the original standards of manufacturer. My biggest disappointment was the size of the teaspoons. They were much smaller. And the teaspoon is already on the smallish side. They are manufactured in China and I was truly not satisfied."
2,Not like the original,"I have enjoyed the look and feel of Dansk Variation V5 stainless flatware for years.I bought additional pieces recently to accommodate a growing family. At first glance, the flatware looks like it always has -- but closer inspection reveals that the grace of the lines has been compromised. The pattern has been cheapened. Is this because the flatware is now made in China? The originals were made in Finland. This is not the fault of Amazon. I ended up keeping what I had bought because no alternative is available."
2,Dansk Variation V,"I have had this pattern for over 40 years and the peices were made in Finland and Japan. What I just received was made in China and I was most disappointed. The size is different, which is not a huge problem, but the quality especially in the forks, is clearly inferior. I will keep it, but had I known what it would be like, I would have started over with a whole new pattern. This order came from csn stores and the service was terrific. The stainless arrived 4 days before they said it would."
5,Best Sounds of Halloween,"In 1977, I was about four years old when this album came on record. My parents bought it for Halloween, I was spooked out of the chair. The story is great, and dozens of sounds. When I went into the cabinet I found the original record. I was amazed it still exists. The more amazing thing is that it is now on CD. I love it when old records are put on CD format. This is good to listen to all year long. Let Halloween remind you to play this awesome CD (record). This is definitely a must have. Give Horrors a try, if you got guts. Ha-Ha-Ha."
4,"My baby, have you seeeeen my baby?","I had this album back in the late '70's when I was around 10 yrs. old. My little sister and I would turn out the lights and listen to the story and scare ourselves. To this day, we can still quote from the story -- of course it's funny now. I was reunited with the CD version around 1990 when I found out my new college roommate had it in her collection. Talk about friends for life!! I'm sure these days there are all kinds of scarier and more ""advanced"" Halloween soundtracks, but this will always be my favorite. It was neat to see that a few other reviewers have enjoyed it, too!"
1,This CD does not match the reviews!,Please notice that this is NOT the original Halloween Horrors from 1977 with the Haunted Mansion story as the previous reviews suggest! This CD is only spooky sounds and DOES NOT contain the original story from the LP. I bought this because of the reviews and I am very disappointed that this is not the original.
5,Classic story from my youth. I never get tired of listening to it! Brings back so many memories.,"Classic story from my youth. I never get tired of listening to it! Brings back so many memories. And besides, it really is an awesome story told by outstanding voice actors. Best ever Halloween CD. Ever."
3,Mine wasn't GE but USHIO,"I just wanted to warn people, this isn't a GE bulb, though it says so. I purchased three bulbs. What I received was ""Ushio Par 38 90W Halogen 120V"". I only used one, and it works, but I thought it was a false advertisement. Though it was Amazon Prime item, the seller wasn't Amazon, but it was ""Bargain Bulb"". I should've paid more attention to that fine prints. Still, one of three works so far, so I guess I'm ok for now."
2,received knock-off product,"though the light bulbs seem to work just fine, they're not GE products -- some knock-off Asian brand that I've never heard of before. I wouldn't mind if the company had asked if it was OK to send an alternate bulb brand."
5,Brand New,The books were shipped in a box with all the books still intact w/ the wrapper. These books literally are new. Amazon knows how to please customers.
3,Good attention getter.,Practice with this and its a lot of fun. I thought there would be more tricks that would come with it though.
3,"Basic, too basic","There are a lot of how-to's in here that are useful, but if you already have an active familiarity with any of catholicism, you probably want something more informative."
5,How could anyone NOT love this book?,"Cristina Garcia writes with elequence, with a wit so sharp, so kind and so filled with wisdom, that one is transported. I recommend this book even higher than her previous novel: DREAMING IN CUBA. Both books are just wonderful. I am an author myself, and I say CHEERS to Cristina Garcia! She is a writer to watch for."
4,Worth a read,"Not as good as Sonando en Cubano and takes a little time to be drawn into it, but it ends up being OK. It's a story of two sisters from Cuba and the divergent paths their lives take."
4,calling all Cristina Garcia junkies,"Readers who loved ""Dreaming in Cuban"" the way I did will like ""The Aguero Sisters"" a lot. They will also realize they've read this book before. It's all here: the two sisters (one in Cuba, one in the US), the wimpy husband, the lovably nutty artist daughter, the prodigal son. So, no, it's not a new novel, but it will satisfy your craving. Try it if you need a treat."
4,It helps me appreciate Cuba,"I didn't know much about Cuba or immigrants from there before I read this book, but now I appreciate what life is like under Castro. I kept thinking I was further along in this book than I was, since I was savoring every word."
3,"Worth a read, but disappointing","I really liked Ms. Garcia's Dreaming in Cuban, and had high hopes for The Aguero Sisters. I did enjoy the book, especially the quirky characters and the way I was effortlessly carried along to the end. I enjoyed her use of French and Spanish in the story, the set of musical parents, the set of scientific parents, and the mythical characters. However, I was really disappointed in the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but my sense was that Ms. Garcia just got tired of writing and so ended the novel. I felt really let down, as I'd been hoping for some grand explanation and was given only a page of vagueness. It's still worth reading, though."
3,Ambiguous,There were parts of this book that I found intriguing enough to hold my interest. And then it would meander and I had to force myself to read on. Lots of gaps in the narrative and lots of focus on what seemed to be gratuitous sex. Not my favorite read but did enjoy learning about the setting in Cuba and the mystery that served as the unifying thread.
3,Uneven,"I heard Stronger Than Desire on my Pandora, and I liked it so much I went and bought the entire album. My first listen through, I was cool with the rest of the album, but after repeated listening, there are only a couple tracks that I still really enjoy: Memory, and Stronger Than Desire.The rest of the album in my opinion is less musically interesting and a little too cheesy for me to swallow lyrically."
5,Great Taste,This is a really great tasting salad dressing that is low in calories. You can use this in any kind of mixed salad. Really good product.
4,Great grins!,Totally enjoyed this book that reminds older women of all ages to take off their inhibitions and live life!
2,not a great cd,"I love Beausoleil and have all their music, but this cd is the worst one that they have done.I found 3 good songs, 3 ok songs and the rest are bad. Hopefully their next cd will be as good as the Lamour ou la folie,la danse de la vie ,or the Cajun Conga cd's."
2,Pass on this... trust me (practicing Brand Manager),"Really disappointed in this offering from HBR. I was tempted to give a single star rating, but feel that someone just looking for a few cases to amuse themself may find this book suitable. While I often purchase cases and articles from HBS, these selections are outdated and lack in shedding light on contemporary branding issues; you can get a better cross-section of cases by going directly to the case site. I guess HBR just wanted to cash in on the 'branding' buzz- unfortunately this is no way to steward their own brand."
2,Outdated,"This book is truly outdated, don't bother to read it. Today it does not add anything to brand management. Most articles concentrate on arguments against line extensions but do it in a superficial way. It is easy to read but very light and almost totally commonsensical. The only part that I like in the book was the case of a shampoo that lagged appeal over time on which a couple of experts offered different solutions. This demonstrates what students often don't understand about case teaching: That there is no single ""solution""."
2,ho hum,"This is painful. Could barely get through the first few chapters. I have read at least 10 great brand books, and this is not one of them. Every once in a while I give it another try. Typically HBR will deliver the right compilation. Not this time.Good Chapter: Extend Profits, Not Product Lines.This is old. Would be nice to get the 14 years later version of this."
3,"An ok book, in great condition.","The content was a bit to general for my purposes, but nonetheless, it offers some good advise on branding."
2,Great ten years ago,"This would have been a great read in 1995; however, the statistics and points made seem very dated given today's reality of fragmented segments, consolidated grocery distribution and strength of private label.This is a good read if you are interested in how issues have changed since '94."
5,zero hour,This video is very good.I recomend this video to any anime lover .For the low price here you can't beat it.
4,Quick!!,"This book was started and finished in one day. A very easy read full of good information on a lot of film career types. I was disappointed in the book, however, because I was hoping (as per the review) for a basic pay scale on each job, but only a couple even mentioned it. It was slightly upsetting, but was an okay worth while read."
4,"Helps explain all those exotic filmworld terms like best boy, gaffer, and grip","This book was fun to read. Written in an upbeat fashion primarily for young people contemplating working in the movie industry in production-related jobs, the book describes these jobs in a direct and breezy way, taking care to define the terms I noted in the title of this review (and many others). So the book also can be interesting to anyone who has a general interest in movies, movie making, and the movie business.I was especially impressed about the job descriptions in the ""special effects"" area because the techniques themselves are also described, adding to my knowledge of them."
5,I Wish I Could Join the Cat Club,"This book from my childhood is one that lingers in my memory. I recently came across my old dog-eared copy, and hoped to find another one used. Instead, I find that it is (rightly) hard to obtain because it is (wrongly) out-of-print. At least I now know I am not alone in my affection for this volume and series. _The Cat Club_ explores that place between our sense of self-worth and our social status, in ways that still delight me (even at forty-something)"
2,"Entertaining, but poorly written","This story was very cute. I only wish the author would have taken the time to have it proofread and edited. It is full of incomplete sentences, run-on sentences, typos, and poor sentence structure throughout. It also lacks fluidity. She seems to intend to bring the story to the reader chronologically, however in one chapter she turns eight and in a later chapter she is seven again. Despite the difficulty I had with the writing, I was interested enough in the story to finish it."
2,Don't listen to the product features...they are all WRONG!!!,"The product features that are listed on the web are wrong, it states:Batteries included.Light up scoreboard automatically keeps score.Crowd sound effects.It has none of this!! I paid all this money for a stupid hoop with some balls! There is no scoreboard, no batteries needed, no noise, no sound effects, no nothing!PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CHEAP TOY YOU COULD GET AT THE DOLLAR STORE."
2,Handle issues,"We have two other Anolon knives that we love, but they have the black standard handles. The wood in the Brunello Collection looked good online, but looks and feels like plastic in reality. It is also not as flush with the metal as it could be.The handle is also very large, so it sticks out above all the other handles in the knife block (we have a mix of German, French and other knives)."
1,stay away from this device,"I had a choice between some cheaper Firewire hubs and this nice looking Kensington model. I thought I'd spend a little more on a brand I've had a good history with. Good lord that was a mistake. This thing squeals like it's got a tire with an air leak, it won't connect my iPod, and did I mention it squeals? I returned it and got another one direct from the manufacturer and it has the same problem. Also, for soome strange reason, it resets my audio settings so my Griffin iMic USB adapter (where the speakers are connected to) sounds muffled.I'm on a Powermac G5 and Powerbook G4."
1,Agree. This is NOISY. Squeels and high pitched noise.,"I can't believe this. It's noisy. It's obnoxious and it's hurting my ears! I just wasted $38...because I'm going to have to get a different hub. This one makes my near-silent system noisy.It's hard to explain, but the moment it's connected it begins to squeal and make this high pitched noise. There are no moving parts, so I can't even begin to explain the squealing."
3,Red speedster fire truck,"My son loves the toy, but after only a couple weeks of use the steering wheel is already broke. For what I paid, I would think the product would last longer."
4,:),"Graham was a highly sought after bachelor with a great career. Graham's life was smooth and orderly until he finds out he is a father. Graham's life is now upside down and has no clue how to be a father to his twins. Graham is also pretty ticked off to discover that the woman he fell in love with had only used him to get pregnant and than disappear from his life. The woman than died leaving Graham with two children. Holly has always had a crush on Graham, but for some odd reason he has avoided her like the plague. Graham is desperate for help and Holly is right there. Graham is attracted to Holly, but the similarities between Holly and the woman that tricked him years ago is uncanny. Hopefully, Graham can see that inside the women are nothing alike. Holly has a heart of gold and would be a terrific mother to the twins and wife for him. This is a great story about a man trying to cope with suddenly becoming a father and all the changes that parenthood bring-both good and bad."
4,funny book,I bought this book for my fiance when we found out we were expecting--it really seemed to put him more at ease with our situation. Just be sure he knows that not all of the advice given in the book is sound (i.e. you should NOT try to demonstrate the Moro reflex by dropping the baby on the floor!).
1,Skip This Book,"This book really pissed me off. The snide remarks and generally condescending attitude towards pregnant women in the book implies that the author thinks that pregnant women are a joke and an oddity. I guess Tom and Pat think that the only way to give a man (who's wife is pregnant) support is to insult women, nature and motherhood because they're feeling inadequate and side-lined. It contained very little actual information and really soured my husband and myself on the whole series."
1,"HORRIBLE,sexist and awful","I got this as a present for my fiance,thinking it would be a cute funny gift during our pregnancy.However,it got here and neither of us were amused.It's a HORRIBLE book!"
1,Book for a Man with a Pregnant Wife Who Wants a Divorce,"If your wife is expecting and you are a chauvanist pig, you might really enjoy this book. Especially if you have no respect for your wife and are looking for a rocky marriage. I was fooled into buying this book and seriously regret it. Save your money! It's full of negative remarks about women in general and assumes that a man and a wife cannot be friends. It is suppposed to be a parody yet is not funny in the smallest way. I would be willling to wager that the author of the book is no longer married, if he ever was."
2,"Husband thinks it's funny, but uneducational",Ditto previous reviewers....This book tried too hard to be funny & wasn't very informative.
1,The wrong book arrived and the seller hasn't returned my email,"Instead of the book I ordered, I received a copy of ""Romeo and Juliet"", something I couldn't need less. In addition, I sent an email asking what happened and when I could expect my correct book. (As it was a gift and about my pregnancy. Something that won't last too much longer!) That was over a week ago I sent them an email and they still haven't responded. All of this, and the wrong book came late anyway!Very upset. Wouldn't order from them again."
4,would recommend,I think this book is very cute and clever and breaks pregnancy down for men to understand. I just wish I could get my husband to read it!
2,"Cute, but not too informative","I bought this for my husband, and although there are some funny parts, it's not really very informative. For instance, a lot of the information from month to month is repeated, and the items to purchase each month are way off - suggesting that you buy things like a jolly jumper and bicycle baby seats by month two."
4,Informative but a hoot!!,I purchased this book for my son who is expecting his first child in December. He didn't have a clue as to what his wife is going through - this book presented the information in a hilarious format.
3,"Funny, but not informative","If you are just looking for a book that will make you laugh, this is a good on, but if you want one that actually has some good information about pregnancy, try another one. It hs a lot of sarcastic humor , that yes made me laugh, but I also wanted some real tips for my husband."
2,Disappointing,"Evidently the author of this book believes expectant fathers are actually not interested in learing about what their wife is experiencing and how their child is developing. Instead, he seems to think expectant fathers need to be distracted. While there were many humorous parts in the book, there was little information. Overall, I found the book disappointing."
2,Save your money.,"I thought this book might be helpful to my husband. We are expecting our first child. This book was insulting. Get ""What to expect when you are expecting"" and tell your husband he can borrow it if he has any questions or concerns during the course of your pregnancy."
1,"A Parody, What to expect when your wife is expanding","I guess the most important thing to observe before buying this book is that it's a parody. I hadn't noticed the parody label on the top right hand corner of the book. Therefore I was dissapointed when I found that I had ordered my husband a parody on pregnancy.If that is what you are looking for, I would suggest buying the book."
4,Great Funny Gift for Moms!,"This book is a parody of What to Expect When You're Expecting.It's not for super serious parents, those who are offended by the idea that dad might not be as ""on the ball"" as his pregnant wife, or anyone who still uses parenting advice books daily.However, it's a great book for laid back parents with a few kids, who have done the overwrought parent thing and moved on enough to be able to appreciate a few jokes at their own expense. In fact, I know more mothers who enjoy this book then fathers!"
2,Husband didnt read,"My husband didnt read this book because he thought it was silly. I read it and thought it was okay and humerous in the right parts, but it didnt have the effect I wanted it to have because hubby didnt read. Oh well...."
5,Great Parody,"Plays off of all of the recurring sections in ""What To Expect When You're Expecting."" Hilarious stuff, with a few useful bits thrown in - fun to follow along with your wife as she expands. Stay away if you are humor impaired."
3,Read the Small Print!!,"I bought this book because I thought it would help me to understand and relate to my expanding wife. Ever since she gave birth to Chad two years ago this November, she has been getting fatter and fatter and fatter. At first I accepted the weight gain as a byproduct of her pregnancy (she put on 40 pounds, 8 of which were the baby),but it's two years later and she's now 70 pounds larger than she was BEFORE she got pregnant. Anyhow, that's why I bought this book. Unfortunately I didn't read the small print beneath the title--this book is NOT about a wife getting fatter, it's a somewhat silly, tongue and cheek, joke of a book about a pregnant wife and the changes she goes through. It's occasionally amusing nonsense, but not at all what I wanted. Be warned."
5,Husband actually read this,My Husband has no interest in books of any kind. However got this so that the shock of the new arrival (and indeed the actual arrival) would not be to much. Imagine my delight when I spotted it on the ledge in the Bathroom. - He actually read it in bits and peices. It is the kind of book you can dip in and out of. I found it good to as it made me consider how he was feeling about things.
2,useless,"While it was funny as promised, the book is totally useless. There is little to no helpful or specific information about pregnancy. If you are looking for something to help your significant other learn about pregnancy, keep looking. Funny as it may be, for someone who knows nothing about pregnancy, some of the information that is a joke might actually be believable."
3,A Little Out of Date,"I didn't really pay attention to the date when I purchased this book. Had I known that it was old enough to not have accurate information in it, I wouldn't have bought it. It is still funny and it has some good information for the dad to be that doesn't want to be overwhelmed with information they neither need nor want. This book is very quick and to the point. Even though some of the information is no longer accurate, it is a great overview."
1,Makes Dads look stupid,"I was looking to get something for my Husband to have him stay informed about what was going on with our little one. This book mostly made fun of the whole situation. The Dad is portrayed as a dumb cave man whose only desire in life is if he can have sex with his wife. The Mom is portrayed as a whining and complaining you know what who will apparently makes her husbands life living hell. This is so not true and frankly offensive. I am 30 weeks into my pregnancy and both me and my husband have truly enjoyed learning about our growing girl from other resources such as What to Expect when your Expecting, The Happiest Baby on the Block, and our midwife."
2,This book scared my husband,"If your husband is even the slightest bit jumpy, and worries about all of the bad things related to pregnancy (money, etc.), then by all means, keep this book away from him. After reading the first two or three pages, I noticed my husband become paler and paler. I thought the book was perfectly fine, and kinda funny, but I guess this is proof that this is not the book for every husband."
1,Not Worth Your Time,For any serious father-to-be this not the book for you. I didn't even finish it. A very rough unserious treatment of the subject.
2,Nothing But A List Of Bad Pregnancy Jokes,Very disappointed in this book. If you want to take your wife's pregnancy seriously look elsewhere. If you want to read a series of not-so-funny jokes try the book out.
3,just one enough from Thomas hill..,"I purchased 2 books from Thomas Hill , surprising but they are almost the same.. "" What the heck u are expecting .."" & this one ""What to expect when..."" just one of them is enough from thomas..."
2,Negative experience,"Having only been through one pregnancy with one woman I can only say that this book doesn't reflect every man's experience. It does tend to have an overall theme of your wife will be most annoyed with you and that she is pretty much a great big snow ball of emotions that could start with you breathing to loud. But, for the laugh value it's pretty funny to hear how this guy impregnated a spiteful woman. I laughed at it, showed my wife a few things because pregnancy is an adjustment for a woman and isn't an everyday in everyway a bed of roses. Basically it made me feel like I have it perfect and this couple needs to implement birth control."
2,OK but Repetitive,"This book does provide some relevant info, but overall is OVERLY humourous and gives repetetive info. on what to expect month-by-month. I read it in one sitting and haven't used it for reference again."
2,Cute,"There are moments here when I found myself very amused. But all in all there are funnier books. For example, I loved ""Delano"" by John Orozco. That was hysterical."
5,I love it,"The recommended books are ordered by reader's age, making it very easy to select the ones that are appropriate for my child's current stage. It also provides a very good description about each book, and how it is different from other books in the same category.I also like that it covers a good variety of books, including books with flaps, mirrors, and squeeky sound, as well as books with different themes and messages for older toddlers. The suggested activities are also fun and creative.The most important thing is, my daughter loves those books. This book is definitely worth the price."
2,Not worth it,This book was not what I expected. I was really excited to read and maybe get some fresh ideas to spice up reading time but this wasn't it. I am not sure my expectations were met because I was a first grade teacher before having children but nothing in this book was very creative. I was disappointed to find their activities were some I was already doing with my girls and just basic common sense.
1,Disappointing,"I had never heard of Cornelius but I was intrigued and thought I would give this a shot. I was looking for some neat video/animation together with some interesting music. With the hopes of being pleasantly surprised I ordered my copy. I must say that I was disappointed in the music as well as most of the videos. The sound is excellent but the only decent video here, in my opinion, is drop. Most of the music is really corny and the last video is plain horrible. If your really interested try to rent this before you spend your money!"
3,3.5 STARS,"This is a pretty good album. Some of the songs get a bit boring after a while, but most of the songs are good. If this album is cheap then go for it, but if not then I probably wouldn't bother if I were u."
3,3.5 stars,"I like Making moves with puff and get down and flava in your ear and Real Raw, but the other songs is a little weird to me not really all that but ok"
2,i didn't really like this album,"i liked the song making moves with puff and get down but the rest of the album i didn't like, i am not a big fan of bad boy records but if u want bad boys best then pick up biggie"
1,"Skimpy, pedantic and superficial","I rarely write reviews, and as an author myself I'm loath to criticize another's work. But this one I couldn't let go by...At 147 pages (main text) there was nowhere near enough ""meat"" to justify ...[the price tag.]The writing style was boring and pedantic.Most of the chapters just skimmed the surface and lackedsubstance; the topics are covered much more thoroughly by otherauthors.Chapter 6, Networking Technology, at 12 pages, was much too""thin"" and already out of date; less than 2 full pageswere devoted to the 'section' on securing the network -- amajor concern these days."
4,"Managing Virtual Teams, by Martha Hayward",A must read for any manager who is either managing or will be managing telecommuters. It is a comprehensive resource on why telecommuting can work for your team and your organization.
2,just not for me,I like trippy movies and all but this one just isn't my taste. its just a really dark version of labrynth. and i didnt like that either. i know things werent pleasant in facist spain but this probably was beyond a ittle too far as fhe treatment of the girl.
4,What An Experience,"I loved the movie which is elegantly structured and written, but the plot twist ( where the young girl dines from the forbidden table...yeah yeah, I know ) left me disappointed. The character presented in the movie woudlnt have eaten from that table. But the feel, the cinematography....terrific."
1,"Literary and religious analogies, historic content, not worth the graphic exposure","I watched this years ago with a teen son, didn't like it then; watched it with another son as a school project again (hence the rental) and continue to dislike it. Too cruel and graphic. I can learn about fascism, cruelty and get an idea of certain historic events without the bashing of heads with hammers and slashing cheeks open, etc., etc., and the strange creature at the tempting table. The creatures were bizarre and subtitles bothersome. Persecuted girl overcomes odds and wins by losing, by self sacrificing to be in a better place is a 'works based' theology that comes out. Too bad it's not true, makes for disappointing conclusion."
3,Not in English,The product description stated that this was in English but it wasn't. The movie itself was still very good. I hope to find an English version soon.
1,I could not download it.,"It really isn't that I hated it, I just did not get to see it as I could not download it. I don't know who to contact to get helpor a refund."
3,It is okay,"To be fair, this film is hard to be excited about in 2013 because of the style and how the story is presented. Our modern war movies are much more realistic and we are a much more demanding audience than when this movie was made. Still, it covers true life situations which real men lived and I watched it with interest."
3,B&W Post War English Movie,This movie is about a rescue boat crew and the crew of an aircraft that have to ditch in the sea. The rescue boat breaks down and delays the rescue of the air crew that are now in a bad way from exposure to the elements. Michael Redgrave has an admirable performance but all in all this movie is poorly shot and lacks realistic drama. Only interesting from a standpoint of post war Britain. Don't waste your money on buying it.
5,Money Well Spent,"I chose this collection for its wide range of Ray's career hits. Some of which I had never heard before, like ""Mess Around."" This was before the film was released of course. All time favorites of mine include, ""What'd I Say"" ""One Mint Julep"" ""Night Time Is The Right Time"" and ""Hit The Road Jack."" A true American Icon, Ray's genius continues through his recordings, for they are timeless. Not much else missing on this one."
1,not recommended,"There are only about 3 or 4 songs in this whole collection that I really like. I think the title of this cd is misleading. I would of liked to have been able to listen to each song before I bought this particular cd. It was a waste of money for me. Ray Charles has so many other great hits that should be on this cd collection, considering the name of it."
5,Easy listening at its best,Arrived on time and in great shape. A great collection.and must have for an easy listening fan. Thanks for the memories
4,Blasphemous Bodacious Blubbering Barnicles!!!,I have listened to this CD four times in 16 hours. I throughly enjoy Guaranteed Chance and I hope to hear much more from Swift Albro in the future. Melodic rock to acoustic bliss. Love it all.
4,Good stuff,"Old School and cool local influences galore, this album sure rocks and brings back the pleasant why-worry times. Too bad Seattle's an expensive flight away, would like to see them live..."
3,He really doesn't like it...,"Purchased this for my 10 year old, but he played it one time and never looked at it again. He did not like it very much. I played it and thought it was fun but I'm not the one who needs to be interested in the game."
5,A compelling photographic odyssey,"Written and photographed by Charlene Edwards, Voices From Vietnam is an informative history, a compelling photographic odyssey, and an emotionally moving testimonial to the tragedies and triumphs of Americans and Vietnamese tangled together in a bitter and lethal civil war. Voices From Vietnam presents a memorable selection of anecdotes about all the human beings whose lives were marked and forever changed by the Vietnam War. The history of this terrible war, its lasting impact and human struggles to survive and grow in its aftermath make Voices From Vietnam unforgettable and strongly reading -- especially because the storm clouds of war are once again gathering."
2,Just ok,This one feels like you've seen it before. The end is a cop out. The vet is interesting but we've met him in many incarnations. An easy read for a plane ride.
1,Does not Fit,"The tolernace on the thread is too big, at 5/16 should be 0.313"" and the actual unit measures 0.295"" , it barely fits the treat and it is very easy to pop out. I had to pay $6.95 for return shipping on a $3.26 unit??"
3,Works,"Replacement for a twenty year old original, seems well made so I have hopes of another twenty years service."
1,Tiresome narratives of the Defeated,"If you've failed massively in life, enjoy wallowing in it, and the best response you could muster was slack-jawed bewilderment ...AND you're willing to be unendingly chatty about it, this loser show is for you. Loser Ira Glass delights in foisting loser after loser story on listeners. The stories are slow and endless and about 70 percent of the time they're quite depressing; because that's the narrow definition of art agreed on by this show's creators and fans. This American Life is a collecting place for defeatists and failures. Has TAL-regular Jonathan Goldstein ever succeeded at anything in life? I mean... really, What a schlep. This is the most regularly miserable, downbeat crap you can listen to on NPR."
1,disappointed baby boomer,"perhaps I'm too old to appreciate these stories. I was too impatient to hear several of them out to the end, though all I was doing was driving to a destination, without alot on my mind. A few were good, but not good enough to immortalize on a CD."
5,I loved this book,I loved this timeless book. I really helped me understand my need for my father. I will use the teachings for my children and hopefully they will turn out better then I did.
2,"Basic Hodgepodge, Unorganized","I saw a small write-up about this book in the newspaper. Intrigued by the title and encouraged by the review, I bought the book. I read through it despite not really enjoying it overall. It seemed real repetitive, unorganized and more or less, it is just a collection of metaphors with a little bit of narrative added to it. While it is a good basic book that you can reference if you are ever in need of a metaphor, if you are looking for a little more strategic use of language this is not it."
4,"Small book, Good Read",Miller provides good examples on how to persuade and sell using metaphors. It is a small book and could've been a bit shorter. I thought towards the end concepts were being repeated. However the information within is top-notch and the exercises will help to get the right brain a-workin'.
3,An improvement over the little viewer.,"The viewer is bigger, but not clear. I'd spend a few extra dollars and get a better one. It's a big improvement over the tiny viewers. You need to purchase the special cutting saw also. It's an odd size. It's really nice not to have to put your face up to the door to see. You can stand back and see who is there. Remember to read the instructions. The viewer shows everything in reverse. It should be installed at the height indicated, otherwise, you will not see everything."
3,Fun low budget revenge movie,"""Prey of the Jaguar"" is a revenge/vigilante movie. Cop Derek Leigh's wife and kid are murdered by a drug lord who escaped from prison. He seeks out his old friend, a martial arts teacher, and trains to become ""The Jaguar"", to avenge their deaths.The movie suffers from a low budget. But the low production values are redeemed by an entertaining script. The movie never gets boring (although they could have shortened the flashback sequences) and it has some good, fun action. Recommended to fans of low budget action movies and vigilante movies."
3,Fun Movie,"I saw this on ION TV tonight, Typical ""Guy gets revenge on Mobster for killing his family"" flick. Cool twist though, he becomes a Superhero from his dead son's drawings ""The Jaguar"" to exact that revenge. He uses Dart guns & such made for him by a toy maker. Fun movie."
2,pray for this jaguar,"This movie is really nothing more than Saturday morning kids' fare, except it is rated R by the MPAA. Therein lies the irony. The sophistication level of the movie is pretty low, stuff kids would believe in. Yet some of the scenes are violent and a bit too gruesome for children to watch. That doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy some aspects of this movie. The scene where our hero practices katas with his martial arts master in the dojo are moments of poetry in motion. And the opening scenes of our hero with his wife and son are nicely portrayed. But with such mixed temperaments this movie is left wanting for a real audience. As one other reviewer stated, Prey Of The Jaguar begs for a remake.I purchased this movie because it is directed by David DeCoteau, who is mostly known for his ""C"" grade horror movies. I was surprised at how much better this movie is directed compared with his Full Moon Production films. It's probably because someone else was writing and producing."
4,Don't isolate this book,"I had to buy this book as we had to use this book for our literature lessons.Initially, you may feel there is somehow a hidden meaning or something lacking in the story. However, as you read on, the story unfolds and you will realize the messages Susan Hill is trying to convey to the reader. The main themes of the book are fear, isolation, courage, human relationships and lastly, evil within the soul of a person. Readers will be shocked by how a child can lack innocence, as referred to Edmund Hooper, an important character in the story. Charles Kingshaw, the character we sympathize with greatly, will move us by the devastating circumstances he lives in.Bullying is no longer a light matter. It can leave a huge scar in one's life and even drive him to suicide. The story holds many symbolic situations and meanings. Parents should no longer underestimate the powers or the deep feelings a child has.Indulge into the story where you will discover the dark aspects of life."
4,I'm the King of the Castle,"Whilst I enjoyed the story very much, I found myself appalled at the ineptitude of the publisher. From repeated typos to run-on sentences to entire paragraphs being printed several times, it was an embarrassing mess."
4,A book designed to be read at school,"Although I have no doubt that ""I'm the King of the Castle"" is perfectly composed and uses all necessary writing techniques, I must say that in some places it seems cold and sterile. The plot is perfectly feasable, however, and the ending is worth the wait. But if, like me, you have to read it 4 times for school, you may not enjoy it quite as much. Take my advice- ask your teacher to use ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" by Harper Lee."
2,disappointed,"I had heard Susan Hill was good and I enjoy English authors...I found it repetative with no redeeming factors. The ending was the final straw. I may try another of her books to see if they are different..but if they are along the same 'tone"" , I will not go to the finish..."
3,An unhappy book with excellent use of language and technique,"I thought that the book was very well written and Susan Hill is a talented author. The characters were well built up throughout the book and I really felt that they were realistic. The book was believable and a book that, even if it's not your cup of tea, you can't put it down because it is written in such a way that you have to keep going and read on....."
4,"I want read more,i don't care if it is 11o'clock at night.","I am the king of the castle is aintriguing book.It makes you wantto read the whole whole book n one.The book is about 200 houndred pages of complete and uter conflct and exitement.It is about a widow with a child moving into a hous with another child and a lonly desperet man.The children hated each,they fought and fought, both children had weaknessso they knew how to get round to each other.The boy couldn't wait to go home.When he herd that the two parents were marrying he went and commited suisied So this the basic idea of the book."
4,Great company,"I ordered the BOHICA shirt and instead received the SNAFU shirt. When I contacted the company, they immediately made it right! This was an amazing company to work with and will order from them again!"
3,energizing,"This is a good video. It would be good for someone who has already had some intermediate yoga classes and knows how to do the poses correctly without injuring themselves. It moves very quickly and allows little time to attain some of the postures; it takes at least 4 or 5 sessions to ""get it"" to remember what is coming next. It would be a terrible tape for a beginner. It is more like being in a class where the sequence of postures is called out, but without any other instruction. The segment on ujayi breath at the beginning is fairly good, and overall it provides an excellent workout. It gets three stars instead of four for the production, which looks kind of late-eighties-exercise-video-ish."
4,"1946 ""Virginian""","this is a remake in technicolor of the 1930 black and white classic, with Joel McCrea playing the Gary Cooper hero role and Brian Donlevy playing the evil Trampas as earlier portrayed by Walter Huston. Sonny Tufts is a little goofier but still good as the doomed sidekick played by Richard Arlen in the earlier version. Both versions are quite good;neither great. This version would probably be more acceptable to viewers who just don't care for older black and white films."
2,Nothing to smile about,"It's a fair bet that people in 1946 were complaining just as much today about too many remakes and how they didn't make 'em like they used to when confronted with remakes as dull and lifeless as The Virginian. This fourth-time-out-of-the-stable take on Owen Wister's influential novel just trudges through the motions, with even Joel McCrea unable to bring anything to the title role and Sonny Tufts giving an object lesson in bad acting as his simpleton best friend gone bad while Brian Donlevy's black-clad Trampas seems a little short for bad guy duty. Even the immortal ""When you say that, smile"" moment is thrown away here. Pretty dire.Universal's DVD boasts an excellent color transfer but no extras."
3,movie,"this movie was okay. i usually enjoy westerns, but felt that this was a very predictable and simple story with a simple story line."
3,Peace with Sound and Visual,This is interesting and peaceful. The videos are good and the music blends in well. So if you are after a little quiet time this video offers some uplifting and peaceful moments. There are areas that could be improved but in general I felt it was worth the price and one I will watch over and over.
5,In His Presence DVD,"This s a wonderful comforting DVD in every way. Beautiful scripture, music and scenery. I get in my recliner and watch it when I need comfort and or help getting out of the worldly stuff and into a relationship with the Lord."
1,dissapointing customer service,never got the NATROL and the company cancelled the order. Tried to email customer services with no reply.
4,"natrol-carb intercept whit phase 2,120 caplets",IM very happy whit the product THANK VERY MUCH A++++++++++++ i
4,Carb Intercept,"I have read nothing but good things about this product. I have just started using it, so long term I don't know, but so far it has seemed to be helpful. Very easy to use and I have seen some results, which is better than some products."
1,Seems ineffective,This product doesn't seem to provide any weight loss effect. I wouldn't recommend that anyone waste their money buying it.
4,Seems to really work!,"I took 2 before my carb meal (burger and fries). I didn't crave any sweets afterwards. The next morning, when I weighed myself, I didn't gain any weight. Didn't lose, but didn't gain. So I think it must have helped. Normally, I would have been 2-3 pounds heavier."
2,Carb blocker?,"I haven't seen any weight loss after the first bottle, but I did cheat over the holiday. Now I am back on track and starting the second bottle, so I will see how it goes this time."
4,Carb Intercept by Natrol,Always good service when ordering from Amazon. The product seems to work but haven't been too consistant in taking it. I will order another supply when needed and am trying to be more diligent in taking it.
4,carb control,"I receieved this item very fast. It works good, but didn't see results like i was hoping. I did lose five pounds. I'm sure it can't work miracles, but we can always dream!!!"
2,"I like paranormal romance, but not this...","I am always looking for a good vampire romance novels. I was excited when I read the reviews for this one. So excited that I bought all three books (...). What a total waste of money. All three books were poorly written. The character development is non-existent. The sex is not sexy or enticing. There is no build-up in the relationships, everybody simply loves each other for no apparent reason. The only thing going for this series is the author's imagination. Don't waste your money on these books!"
5,As Expected,"The Pilot G2 is one of my favorite pens. Since the pen holds up well refills are a must. You definitely want the ""extra fine"" tips because gel ink in larger tips can get messy."
3,Writing is Too Light,A matter of preference really. Not as smooth and dark as the .7mm. Pilot gel pens are great! Penmanship is smooth and gel dries instantly. Can write on damp paper without smudging.
5,Excellent Pens,I love the Pilot Dr. Grip Gel Pen. I like it because it's comfortable to write with plus it's refillable. I find the refills to be reasonably priced. This gives you the chance when you find that great pen you like to write with to keep it!
3,Corporate Buggery,"Superlative ink. Somehow, though, it manages to be the same price or even slightly more expensive than a pair of new pens. It would be a responsible choice on the manufacturer's part to pass along some of the cost savings associated with reduced materials to the consumer, not only as an incentive to make a less ecologically harmful decision, but also as a reward to the product loyalty inherent in buying refills for a disposable pen.You could write it off as being stingy but I think they would sell a lot more of these if they were a nickel less expensive than the pens for which they are intended. Then everyone can feel good about reducing waste. Until then, I'll keep putting India ink in my Rapidograph."
3,maybe a little to thin,"The tips may be a little too thin, to the point that it really doesn't roll smoothly over paper like you would expect out of a gel pen."
5,Gel Ink Refill,"Went to a Staples vendor show at school and received a free B2P pen (Bottle to Pen that uses half of a recycled water bottle to make the pen). Searched for a refill and found these on Amazon. It's a good price and it does exactly what it's supposed to do -- write. It's not the smoothest gel ink rolling ball, but I actually prefer not-so-smooth, so I can control my handwriting better."
5,I always loves Japanese stationery!,Pilot never disappoints me. I write smooth and it won't break all in a sudden. Love that it always come with refill which is more environmental friendly.
3,"Love the product, misleading title","I love the G2. However the title of the product is misleading - there are only a total of 2 pen refills here, not 2 packs of 2 each as may be implied in the product description."
5,The best gel ink out there,This ink and the 0.38 are the only gel ink I'll ever use as a refill. It writes light and thin which makes whatever I'm writing smooth and neat. I just wish 0.5 and 0.38 were more readily available in stores instead of having to order online. Great ink and great pen that accompanies it
3,"Some flaws, but great flow","I use the Pilot G2 for everyday writing, and, occasionally, pen and ink drawings. It offers a thick, steady stream of quality ink, but in both applications, smearing can occur. Again, the refills empty in an eyeblink, but these seem inescabable compromises with gel."
4,Good Quality Refills,"I'm using these to refill my Pilot G2 pens and they work perfectly with those pens.The only problem with this type of ink is that it easily smudges.If I'm writing really fast and I go to the next line, sometimes the ink isn't done drying yet so it'll smudge. This is the only problem I've found so far with these pens.Other then that, the width of the point is perfect for me because it's not too thin like those ultra points but not too thick like a marker."
5,Worth the effort!,"I love my Dr. Grip gel pens and I use the freqently. It was alittle expensive for the actual pen, but the refills make up for it. They are cheap and easy to replace."
3,The pen is great but....,I really like these pens but am appalled that the refills cost just about as much or the same!! Seems like they really want to just sell more of the complete product rather than decrease waste. The refills must cost much less to make than the pen altogether so why 2+ dollars for the refill themselves??! I think these should sell say 5 refills for a couple of bucks. Then it would be worth the effort for people to actually save the pen and put in a new ink cartridge. I see these pens (which despite being great to write with do drain quickly) being thrown away all the time 'cause there's another in the box! :( IMHO because of this companies pricing structure nobody realistically has the incentive to recycle the pen.
1,Ridiculous,These refills have doubled in price since I purchased them less than six months ago. Why is the blue ink half the price?Now these refills cost more than the pens. What a waste.
3,Two refills cost more than two pens,"I love the pilot pens, and I love the idea of buying refills instead of entire pens, thereby keeping all those plastic pen housings out of landfills, but when the refills cost 2 for $3.99, and the complete pens cost 2 for $2.99 (seePilot G2 Fine Point Rolling Ball Black Gel Ink Pens, 2-Pack (31031)), where's the logic?Pilot should make it more cost-effective to buy refills instead of complete pens, not less so!Three stars -- the average of five stars for a great idea, with one star for a bad price."
1,FIVE BUCKS TO SHIP???,"I love these pens. Only pen I use. So I came looking for refills, thinking it's better for the environment, lower cost, etc. I read the review about the refills costing more than the pen, and noticed the seller DID drop the cost of the refills to 80 cents apiece. But five dollars to ship?!? All of a sudden my refills are almost three fifty apiece. I'm sorry, but this seems excessive to ship something that's already shrink wrapped and could (and probably will) be mailed in an envelope. I'll look elsewhere."
3,Decent pen refill...,"Worked good for the first couple of weeks, but begin drying up and not working very often. Wouldn't buy again."
2,Great for about two weeks.,"I love the ultra fine point of these refills, but I think the tips may just be too small. After about two weeks, both of the pens stopped working. The heads got clogged and I couldn't use either of them. I now use the .05 pens and they're great. They write about the same and the difference in the two isn't worth it for me."
5,Happy I Found Them,Exactly what I was looking for! Locally found only the complete pens. No refills. Arrived when promised and I'm happy!
3,Purple Ink,"I love these pens, and I have several of them. However, the purple ink does not write as smoothly as the other colors. It's also more pink and light in color then purple. Maybe I just got a faulty package..."
5,pilot G-2 fine point gel (red) pack of 2 refills,"ordered on 4/15/10 and received on 4/21/10: speedy delivery and very reasonable price. thank you I use Amazon for just about all I need as they are extremely reliable,reasonable and guarantee their transactions."
1,scratching paper,The price of these refills reveals its quality. It scratches the paper while writing. The original ones that came with my pen wrote smoother.
4,Happy Guy,This was a gift for my nephew who loved it! He collects Buddha figures and was bragging and showing it off to everyone. It's a nicely made little figure. Definitely makes ya smile!
2,Easy to put down,"I have read other Ana Leigh books and have enjoyed the characters and humor. This book is okay, yet easy to put down. The female seems like a brat and not realisticly cautious for a lone women in the west with no family. Cleve is sorta average. It does get better later in the book.The book is okay it just took effort to warm up to the characters."
5,A Great Movie,It's a great movie to watch......... I really liked it when I seen it about a year ago and I can't stop watching it!!!!!!!! I recommend it to any Joe Penny & Melissa Gilbert fans.
4,Not a Proper Album,"No one seems to have mentioned here that this isn't a proper ""album."" It's an odds n' sods collection of unreleased material and reworked live cuts. It's far more consistent than ""Head Shop,"" but still lacks the cohesiveness of ""Timebomb High School,"" ""Too Much Guitar"" or ""Break Up...Break Down.""That said, it's a good collection. I'm tempted to give it 3 starts, but the fact that it's Greg Cartwright means I'll give it one extra. Why? Because he writes great songs that don't always hit you right away. There's lots to discover, and I doubt I've ""gotten"" it all yet.Highlights are the acoustic reditions of ""If You Can't Give Me Everything"" and ""Funny Thing""; ""Carol"" and ""Pretty Girl"" (previsouly unreleased as far as I know), ""If Christmas Can't Bring You home"" (previously 7"" vinyl only), and a great live version of The Gentrys' ""Don't Send Me no Flowers, I Ain't Dead Yet.""I'm with ""Jumpin' Jesus"" - what I really want is another TBHS, but this is good for now."
3,OK,this dictionary is not for the new learner as it is mostly in Hebrew; i needed a dictionary that was easy to use for the English speaker learning Hebrew. this seems to be written for the Hebrew speaker learning English
1,Not as I thought it would be as stated in the advertisement.,"I was searching for a Hebrew dictionary that would give alpha interpretation, rather than the Hebrew signs. I am interested in learning more about Hebrew words, but this particular dictionary does not meet my need because I have no background in the Hebrew language. This dictionary is not for the beginner."
3,"Good dictionary, poor manufacturing!","I purchased this dictionary as I was looking for one with great insight into the hebrew language and the facets of various hebrew concepts. It is not lacking in this area, but my main problem with it is that the hebrew type is so small that sometimes a 'pe' (modified form of 'fe') appears as a large blot because of the dagesh in the center. Bad print. Also, the same night I finally got this book, a page came loose even with very careful handling. It is not placed together good at all, yet Ben-Yehuda's work does not fail. If it were manufactured with more care, I would have given it a 5."
3,Problem Book,"I First bought the book in 1961 when the plates were brand new. At that time it was a 5 star, and well made . Over the years I had to buy several replacements and slowly the plates have become nearly illegable. Also the last version I bought was only a few months ago and it has already started to fall apart due to a drop in manufacturing quality apparantly. I had hoped that new plates would be done and perhaps a better binding. However since I see similar recent complaints I gather this has not yet come to pass."
5,"A W S O M E !!! (not as good as Live After Death, but great)","Okay...not as good as Live After Death, but still great...I wasnt really sure what to expect. But as soon as I poped it in my cd player on the way home...I was hooked. The intro is quite ""spooky""...I like it a lot because I really like the songs they played. Live After Death sounds so good, but I like a lot of the new songs so...I like Rock In Rio just as much as Live After Death, but if you'r a new comer to Iron Maiden I recommend Live After Death first. Rock In Rio is great for any Iron Maiden Fan!!!UP THE IRONS!"
4,UP THE IRONS! 4.5 stars,"Iron Maiden's intensity and overall furosity are captured nearly perfectly on this CD. Bruce's voice seems somewhat weak in the beginning (noticable on The Wickerman, or maybe it's just because the 250,000 screaming fans drown his voice out). Either way it improves greatly by the 4th song so it really doesn't bother me. The musicianship is perfect, at no point is there is a mess-up. The guitar solos are awesome. I think it could have benefitted from a few tracks for solos. Like Heartbreaker and Moby Dick on How the West Won it would have been great to hear these guys no-holds-barred solo. But alas they do not and that is my only complaint."
2,Nice...but what's the point!!,"Yes, what is the point in hearing the same old selections? How about more from ""Somewhere in Time"" or different tracks from ""Piece of Mind"" or any other album. If you like Maiden (and I do) you will be better off hearing the old ""live"" sets. Just the same old stuff...except for some new tracks it ain't worth the money!!The sound quality is not bad, but sounds raw towards the middle of the first set and continues until the end of the second. It's just pure raw Maiden. With the same old tunes. BORING!!!"
3,Buy it if youre a fan,I was listening Maiden England on my Stereo and i thought to make a review of one of the saddest live albums of a metal band since S&M. This album has nothing new to offer except Sign of The Cross and Clansman vastly superior to the version sung by Blaze. Nothing new at all. Buy it if its your first Maiden album
3,Good,"The thing I didn't like was the song selection. For example, I just don't consider The Clansman, or Bloodbrothers to deserve inclusion. Also, instead of The Sign Of The Cross they could have inserted two better songs. I don't know why Maiden always fails to include more songs from Somewhere In Time (Stranger in A Strange Land, Wasted Years, Alexander the Great)and Seventh Son (Moonchild,Seventh Son)"
5,I WAS THERE,"I am very proud to write this review,as maybe I'm the only one here to be there by the time it was being recorded.I'm a Maiden fan since 1980,when I bought their album.But in the 90's things just didn't work for the band,and not so good albums were released.Brave New World was a beautiful return,and a lot should be expected from the concert in Rio.They didn't disappoint us,and the performance was just perfect.Everything was like old Maiden,there they were again,the Beast was back!!I just can't describe what it was to be there watching them as I did in 1985,in Rock in Rio I(I was there,too).So,as it is impossible to say it in words,buy this album and feel how it could have been.A perfect performance for the perfect audience.It was just impossible not to cry when more than 100.000 people joined the eternal intro to ""Number of the Beast"".Technically,this is also a perfect live album.Good quality recording,everything is clear and ,god,how they can play.Buy this.Then come to Rio."
4,Great energy.....,"and the material from Brave New World is done well. Doing the Blaze material was ok, but he could have left that off. They can also get rid of Janick Gers. He should have joined Deep Purple instead of Steve Morse, but that's another story. Dream of Mirrors is the best song on the record. Bruce's voice isn't too good on Number of the Beast, but he gets by."
1,"Oh, no!! They did it again!!","I can't believe they included ""Iron Maiden"" and ""Sanctuary"" in their live album!! Nothing against the old days, much on the contrary. They were the best days for Iron Maiden. But, form that time, ""Prowler"" is better; ""Phantom of the Opera"" is better; ""Remember TOmorrow"" is better, ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" is better, ""The |Prisoner"" is better, and so on and so on!!!!! Iron Maiden and Sanctuary are some of the silliest songs Maiden ever wrote (musically and lyrically)!! Worst than this, they were already featured in the other live albums by Maiden!! It seems like Rush, that always put ""Closer to the Heart"" in their live albums!! Really boring!! What a lack of imagination!!THis Live set at least tried to capture on disc the excitment of a live peformance in front of 200 hundred thousand people. But, Steve Harris, please, get rid of Janick Gers and chose your live set more properly!!"
2,Smart,"After generating so much hype with the long awaited reunion with singer Bruce Dickinsn and guitarrist Adrian Smith, which resulted in their best album since 1988's SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON, Maiden fed upon that hype and rapidly released a live album to make some cash....That's all this album is all about: money. There's nothing new here, except the fact that Bruce sung two songs fron Blaze Bayley's days, The Clansman and Sign of the Cross."
1,beware of copy protection crippling,"Some copies of ""Live in Rio"" have copyright-protectioncrippling and won't play on my cdrom player on the computer.Buyer beware! I went through and returned three copiesalready and they all wouldn't play on the computer'scdrom drive on serveral different machines."
1,Why?,"ALone in the the middle of a third-class roster, Maiden really was the best act in the Rock in Rio III festival, realized in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in January, 2001. They proved for their critics that they still have a trick or two to teach the mediocre bands of nowadays.So, why am I rating this one star? Because there's absolutely no reason for a Maiden fan to buy another compilation from them. In recent years, we had a lot of live albums by Maiden, more the compilations Best of the Beast and Ed Hunter. That's it: I don't see any reason for this product to exist. They should at least have recorded one more studio album with the reunited line-up. Sad, Maiden. Rod Smalwood is never satisfied with the money he's making..."
5,Scream for me Brazil.....,"If you are a TRUE Iron Maiden fan, this CD is a must have. They have never sounded better! This is a great live recording and the track list is fantastic (covering things all the way back to Maiden's ""Jurassic Era"" to quote Bruce Dickinson). Do yourself a favor and buy this CD, you won't regret it!UP THE IRONS!"
4,Very Solid Live Album(4.5),"I really like this live album by the greatest band of all time. It isn't up to par with ""Live after Death"", which was the greatest live album ever. My complaints would be too much material from Brave New World, and the lack of songs from such classic albums such as Powerslave, Somewhere in Time, etc.Other then that, this is greatness all around.My favorite two are The Clansman and Sign of the Croos, which were actually great when Blaze did them, but friggin awesome with Bruce on the vocals! Great, amazing renditions of the classic tracks."
2,"A resounding ""meh""","""Island of Death"" was mostly a disappointment. It does manage to fufill the PDA ideal of feeling like the era it's set in (season 11).... it just feels like the worst things about that era. Mainly, the Doctor's an arrogant childish jerk the first half of the book and there's about 50 pages of pure padding in the middle that killed any feeling of suspense I might've had. Not that there was that much suspense to begin with, it's obvious pretty early on roughly where it's all going, bar a few minor twists.But on the bright side, I liked the way Letts tried to flesh out Sarah Jane a little (too bad he didn't do it 30 years ago!), and I think he did a decent job with the Brig."
4,Black Comedy at it's finest!,"This is HOT! Check out the early years of some of the greatest comedians of our time; Dave Chapell, Bernie Mac, DL Hughley, Steve Harvey, amongst others!"
5,funny,i won't lie when the wayans bros. quiet directing these movies they kinda got lame. but i still find them funny as hell and scary movie 3 is funny as hell
3,This movie sucked compared to the other two.,"This movie was very dissapointing. First off shorty wasn't in it which is one of the wayne's brother's. Actually there are only two people in it who were from scary movie one and two. Cindy and her friend. The movie is basically a knock off of the Ring. They picked up some horrible actors for this movie. The little kid was kind of stupid. There are some jokes and humor spread out through the movie but it just doesn't match tho Scary movie one and two. Also they changed the rating from rated R to PG-13, which is kind of sad because they can't have the funny humor and hilarious parts from the previous movie in it. This is way more family safe. If you liked scary movie one and two you might like this. For the people who haven't seen scary movie one and two go see those instead, unless you can't then see this but beware it's not that good."
2,Stupid,"The sort of humor in this film will appeal to some (mostly adolescents). If this is your type of movie, by all means, ""get it"". There is a time and place for everything.However, for me, it is tired with a series of stale jokes and little originality. I found the first spoofs interesting and novel (i.e. Airport, Naked Gun, etc.). By this time the novelty has worn off and they have been done to death (pun intended)."
2,Overworked,"Without the infamous Waynes borthers, I found this movie a bit boring. Tired plot with only two spoofs of The Ring and Signs. The plot was too thin, the comedy was trite, and the whole movie was a waste of time. Besides the fact that there was a few laughs to have, the line up of stars was the only thing to look forward to. I suggest to anyone who has seen the first and sequel to this movie, don't hold your breath waiting to laugh..it isn't there."
1,What a wasted,"With the Waynes Brothers stepping aside, David Zucker sat in the director's chair to take a shot at the thrid movie.And missed horribly.With so much talent and no real story the 3 movie fall flat on it's face with no real direction, only a constant stream of jokes, not many of them are that funny.With attempts to Spoof 8 mile, Matrix Reloaded, the Ring, and Signs did not pan out at all. The connection with the tape in the Ring and the monsters in Signs just didn't connect.Unlike the pervious movies that were rated R, the studio wussed out and made it a hard PG-13. This is a movie that is meant to be R"
2,Let Down,"I enjoyed the first two movies, but this one was obviously the brain child of someone different. The good jokes are too few and far between. The focus was totally off on what to spoof and frankly, the lack of the Wayan brothers made this film not so funny. They gave it the outrageous factor (and R rating) that made it funny and different. It was like watching a skit show with many commercials in between. There were great actors, but even they couldn't carry the film void of plot. I want my money back!"
2,It really wasn't funny,"I was disgusted by the first one and pleasantly surprised by the second movie. I admire Anna Faris and her ability to never take herself seriously and be silly in any situation. Here, she was lacking. Charlie Sheen was maybe the funniest character in this movie, not that that says much. A lot of the jokes were really dumb, and like a previous reviewer said ""boring"". The humor veered more towards slapstick, and relied more heavily on people getting hit by random objects and knocked in certain delicate places of their anatomy. I felt like I was watching a cartoon.Just because people are beating each other up over a stupid misunderstanding doesn't make it funny. I felt like I could have thought up some of that stuff at home. I was disappointed in what they drew from what was actually very promising material. Oh well."
3,Ok movie in the SM trilogy,"This was a ok movie. Not great but good. I'm giving it a 3 because only 2 things are missing. The Wayans Bros. Other than that OK. They make great parodies of the ring, 8 mile, signs, and the others. Charlie Sheen was great in this also Leslie Nielson. OK but I hope in the 4th one Shorty comes back."
2,"Not the greatest movie in world history, but . . .","I would have to disagree with the statement that Scary Movie 3 was the best movie ever made. The movie was a complete mesh of other famous flicks, such as The Ring and Signs. I wouldn't suggest that people would buy this movie because it's just humor thrown into odd places. I've seen the movie five times, and although I laugh, it still isn't the greatest movie. I'm just relieved that there wasn't as much language in this movie than in Scary Movie 2. My God - they swore every other minute! Anyway, buy The Ring or Signs if you want to see a really good movie!"
1,"No Wayans, No Comedy","Much like the first 2, Scary Movie 3 was based on the hot scary movie of the year, in this case it was ""Signs"". The only difference between third and the first two is that this one wasn't funny in the least. Not written, directed, or seen in the movie (like the previous two), the Wayans brothers had nothing to do with this film. They signed over their rights to all productions, which explains why this movie tanked.The only scenes worth the slightest chuckle can be seen on the previews. I suggest you save the five dollars it cost to rent it for a real comedy."
1,No Humor Here!,"Don't buy this DVD. The jokes are flat, there is no cohesive plot, and the special effects are third rate. Anna Faris and Leslie Nielsen are the only bright spots in this flick. Leslie could make the description of a three car wreck seem funny."
1,the funniest thing about this is.....,"the fact that people are saying this was funny.i snickered in the opening scene then my eyelids started to fail me.the best compliment i could give this is it was childishly goofy,hence the pg-13 rating.im sure the teens will give this the ol''its the greatest comedy of the whole wide year''rating.and thats because the movie was aimed at them.i was surprised cuba gooding jr wasnt in this mess.producers need to learn to end a series.those responisble for the blair witch junk did(3 movies too late though).i read that S.M. part 4 is to be released on us but to the delight of the teens in feb 04.i gotta stop watching previews,theyre costing me money!"
5,I'm just screwin with ya,"When I saw that there would be an unrated version of Scary Movie 3 I was so happy beacouse that is my favorite movie af all time. I will get it right when it comes out and I will watch it again and again. It's about time they let us see all the nasty, disgusting unrated material that wasn't in thw PG-13 version."
1,not at all like the others,when i first saw the previews for scary movie 3 on tv i thought it would be just as funny as the first 2..but boy was i wrongg..the movie totally suckd it was not funny at all nd anyone who thought it was is retarded bc the movie was outright retarded i would not recommend this movie to anyone if u wanna see funny movies the first 2(scary movie & scary movie 2) were off the hook halirous..this movie madd fun of the stupiest movies it was a total dissapointment..and i hope that they post this review up bc people should know how the movie really was
4,U have to watch Scary Movie 3,Hello this is my revioew for scary movie 3 it is the mos ... funniest movie i had to c it lik 3 times cause it laughed n not many movie make me laugh I give it 4.5 stars cause it a mad movie better than the others well la8rz
2,Lacking parody with few laughs,"While it's better than Scary Movie 2, Scary Movie 3 finds original director Keenan Ivory Wayans and sibling stars Shawn and Marlon Wayans out of the picture, with Airplane! director David Zucker at the helm of this lacking parody sequel. Anna Faris returns as dim-witted Cindy, this time a bottle blonde reporter who finds herself embroiled in a mysterious tape, UFO's and alien invaders, a white wanna-be rapper (Simon Rex), his farmer brother (Charlie Sheen), and plenty of other spoofs of the Ring, Signs, the Matrix sequels, 8 Mile, and plenty of other hit Hollywood flicks. However, the laughs are few and far between, and the only cameos here worth noting are from George Carlin as the Matrix Reloaded-spoofing Architect and Zucker fave Leslie Nielsen as the insane President. With a fourth film already in the works, it's time that Miramax stops beating this dead horse."
1,Pathetic,"Well Scary Movie 1 and 2 were pretty awful, but still some jokes could put a merciful smile on my face. However Scary movie 3 fails to book the same result as the writers accidently forgot to put in the jokes this time. It is rather difficult to say which kind of people were targeted to enjoy this movie, but I figure them to be 12 year old boys without a brain. This movie does not only suck, because of the worst jokes in the world. The movie even has the nerves to reintroduce Leslie Nielsen, Pamela Andersen and Charlie Sheen again while everybody had been hoping those people were bannished from any screen forever. After watching this miserable piece of junk I did not dare to put the Scary Movie 4-dvd in my recorder anymore.(SARR)"
2,Boring!!!!,Man this movie sucked BIG TIME!!!!!!!!!!!! i only watch like 23 minutes of the movie Scary Movie 2 is the best my dad & my mum didint get any of the jokes so i got out scary movie 3 & returned it with my check this is a must rent!!!!!!
1,How to ruin a good triligy- see Scary Movie 3 page 7,"Scary movie and scary movie 2 were good spof movies. Scary Movie 3 comes out October of 2003 and it sucks. The acting sucks (not that one should juge acting in a film like this) and it's just not funny. The Scary Movie triligy went from funny spofs with ranchy, sometime racial hummor to shear stupidity. With plenty of hot girls and the guy from ""Son of the Beach"" thsi flim seemed like a really bad eposode of ""Son of the Beach"". The flim procedes to poke fun at ""The Ring"", ""Signs"", the newest ""Matrix"", and ""8 mile"". Last time I checked ""8 mile"" was not a scary movie. The only part that made me somewhat laugh was an overweit, afercan-american man typing the quo-card for a white ancorman. In conclusion, ""Scary Movie 3"" is a very dark chapter in the history of movies that make fun of other movies."
1,good yet bad,Nicholaus- Overall I think that this movie was o.k considering that the Wayans Brothers weren't involved in this one. It could've been better since it had a bunch of a list actors and acteresses. It was funnier than part 2 though. It also got kinda corny towards the end.
1,Disappointment gripe,Not a good movie. Inane and directionless.Watched it only because I hadn't seen this one from series.1&2 excellent3&4 :( :(Waste of time and opportunity
3,Okay,This film is okay. Funny but a bit stupid.Making fun of Michael Jackson has gotten old.I would watch it again though.
1,It's no AIRPLANE.....,"When I found out at the end of the movie that one of the Zucker brothers was directing, it made everything clear.... They tried sooo hard to make this movie into a 2003 AIRPLANE...but it fell severely flat. This movie doesn't even come close to the 1979 classic! This movie was so horrid...I am even contemplating not buying the DVD! Now, that is sad! Please save your hard earned money for something better...."
4,not bad...,"This movie wasn't so bad. It wasn't the best either but what can you expect? it's better than the second but not as funny as the first. Anna Faris did a great job and she protrays her character well. I enjoyed her performance the most. One thing that kinda kept me bored about this movie is the scene where they spoofed ""8 Mile"" and that kinda left me bored.If you didn't watch some of the movies it spoofed than you probably wont get it because I know some of my friends who don't. I'll probably get the DVD on strength of reputation? heeheeOverall a good saturday night flick that you can enjoy for yourself or with friends."
2,This movie was a waste,"I went and saw this movie earlier in the day. Some parts of the movie were funny, but the rest was a waste of time. PLEASE don't spend your money on such a BAD movie."
3,3 rules over 2 and 1,"Scary Movie 3 was a rather stupid yet hilarious movie. The first two were sick and the jokes were somewhat funny in some parts. I like how scary movie 3 is rated PG-13, it really gives it a broader audience...overall, scary movie 3 was hilarious, i would recommend this movie over the 1st and 2nd"
2,A couple of big laughs surrounded by unfunny content.,"I did laugh hard a few times during this movie, but overall it was pretty weak. I'm pretty sure I could write and direct a funnier spoof of horror movies."
3,Enjoyable at best.,"First things first, I found the first two Scary Movies appalling, and I borrowed this dvd on a friends suggestion.I am happy to say I was pleasantly surprised! It seems the departure of the Wayans brothers from this franchise has revitalised it.This film takes off movies such as Signs, 8mile, the Matrix, The Ring, The Others and more in the way Naked Gun and Airplane spoofed their respective movies. This is because one of the Zucker brothers directed this, and whilst its knowwhere near as good as his previous films, it's a huge improvement on Scary Movie 1 & 2. (How did they get away with the Michael Jackson spoof? Close to the knuckle and very funny!)The extras are excellent, in particular the alternative ending, which is very interesting to watch (though thank God they went with the final cut, as the alternative simply isn't funny - but its completely different - spoofing the Hulk).A fun film, with adequate performances and excellent extras."
3,It's Okay - But It Does Trys - Go Charlie Sheen!,"Scary Movie 3 is a farce and funny. The gags and tributes or satires to Signs, The Ring, The Matrix and ten other movies are hysterical. Light fun and great visual gags. The first film is still the best - but this one has its moments.It really tried to take long jabs at things and rely a lot of slapstick especially at a wake sequences. Directed by David Zucker - of all the Airplane movies it tends to drag a little.Pamala Anderson and Jenny McCarthy are hysterical in the beginning and this really is Charlie Sheen's film. I love the fact that Mr. Sheen loves doing these films. Hot Shots 1 and 2 and Load Weapon and doesn't mind doing funny gags, jokes, slapstick and just plain old fashion prat falls!Fun. Wait for the DVD - I hope it will have more extras ! (11-10-03)"
3,Scary Movie or Dumb Comedy?,"Well there both. This film has some original characters from the first two movies, but new ones that makes this film almost a two star film. After I saw the second ""Scary Movie"" I thought Whoa, this is a load of crap. When I heard they were going to make another one, I almost didn't go, but I like the ""Naked Gun"" movies and decided to go. I still like the characters Cindy and Brenda and the movies new humor. What I don't like is its dumb characters (like the president) who's jokes are plain dumb (the pee coming out of the finger)."
4,Third Time's a Charm and better than the second one,"I enjoyed Scary Movie 3 and I found it better than the second but the first one is the best out of the whole series.Alot of parts you will laugh your ass off and some parts that are dumb, but this a movie worth watching."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I saw this in the movie theater. I was SO excited because I loved the first two, but this movie absolutely blows. I don't think the Wayans brothers had anything to do with this film or it would at least be sort-of funny. It was not funny, the best character, Shorty, wasn't even in it, even though his 'fro was in the original movie poster. I swear to God, I didn't laugh once. I just stared in disbelief at this train wreck of a movie. There were a ton of celebrities in it, but that won't make a film funny, you know? People who think this is such a funny film must be insane, there's no other excuse.Well, I expect those people are 13 and don't know any better. I should have gone to see Underworld instead..."
5,Funny as Hell!!!,"I saw this movie the first day it came out and let me you, I got a headache I was laughing so hard, this movie was hilarious. Not better than the first two, it's about the same. I thought David Zucker did a good job with this movie for not doing the first two. He kept the original feel of the first two, which was another thing I liked.A lot of funny spoofs especially Matrix Reloaded, Ring, and Signs, very creative, I loved em. Charlie Sheen and Anna Faris were pretty funny in this too...."
3,it was alright i guess,"the fact that m-max made it pg-13 ... me off. the jokes were nothing but kid jokes. when i went and saw it in the theature, there were all little kids in there talking, so my experience ...leslie neilson and anthony anderson saved the movie with their funny one liners and halarius acting. I think they should have tried to make it R so it would have had better jokes, and would have been like the others. The wayans brothers are better at making the scary movie, movies, that m-max. What happened wayans? m-max cant make ..."
1,Stupidest movie ever made,The wayans Bros was not in this movie like the last two. This was thrown together and did not make sense. Was 8 mile supposed to be scary??? Dont waste your time and money buying this movie just watch it over a friends house and let them waste their money. Go see white chicks with the Wayans Brothers if you want a laugh.
1,Screamingly unfunny...,"I bravely endured about 20 painful minutes of this surrealy unfunny disaster. That's when i realised that the 3-4 funny scenes this stunningly bad movie included were all in the trailer i'd seen months ago in the theaters.Unless you're in the ages 11-14 (not that this is an excuse)you need to avoid this. ""Scary movie 3"" has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever ""seen"" even if it was for just 20 minutes but then just as well it was one of the most agonisingly bad 20 minutes i've witnessed on celluloid.There's nothing more worth adding to all this, i've said way more than enough. The barrage of negative reviews about this utter calamity are no coincidence..."
1,A kick to the junk would be better!,"Let me start off by saying that, David Zucker, usually a creative guy, the backbone behind the Naked Gun series that we all loved growing up, has taken a break to direct this piece of crap. By all means, I'm a very easy to please guy, but the fact that the theater was being silent during the entire movie says soemthing about a comedy. Ignore this movie, you'll thank me later."
1,"No Waynes, no winner!","Trying as hard as possible to humor myself, just to make it worth the money to get in, I realized it is pointless to fight the lameness that accompanied this film. This movie lacked the extremities that pushed scary movie and it's sequel over the edge into new territoy. Haunted by the usual clichés of any comedy sequel, the cast in SM3 did not seem choice for delivering the one punch lines as well as the previous. Scenes streched and tired easily. Mazin and Profit, although trying to follow the Wayne's examples set in the first to films of the franchise, seem to lack the grotesque and random nature of the original writers that made scary movie unique from other comedy spoofs. In my opinion, Scary Movie 3 was a horrible end to what could have been a great trilogy."
1,"If you liked 1&2, you'll hate this","Man this was bad! I Liked Scary Movie, loved Scary Movie 2, hated this. Not only is it one of the movies that all the funny scenes are in the commercial, two scenes in the commercial arent even in the movie!I expected a lot more from David Zucker. really really bad."
2,Not good this time.,"I've seen ""Scary movie 1"" and ""Scary movie 2"" and found them funny. A little bit stupid but funny (I bought both of them anyway). And I had high spectations for this one because I found the trailer very good. So when I got this one and started wacthing it, i was waiting for the good funny stuff to come but let me tell you that I just laughed during one scene and nothing more. Besides the movie only takes 74 minutes.You'll find several known people here like Pamela Anderson, Queen Latifah and Leslie Nielsen. Finally I can say that they tried very hard on this one because there were not several terror movies that came out lately and one proof of that is that you'll find here a parody of Eminem's ""8 mile""."
4,Great trilogies come in threes.,"this movie is comic genius. putting The Ring and signs together and making them funny, is..............funny. since the other ones are rated R, (sadly) I cant compare them to this one. some people said this one is dumb because of some dumb reason but this one is so funny, when I saw it in the movie theater, I almost started crying. just so you people know, its pretty surprising its PG-13. but its the best comedy I've ever seen."
3,Lots of good extras,This was a pretty fun movie to watch because everyone seemed to be playing it straight. You are going to have to watch is a couple of times to get all the jokes. Most of the movie pokes fun at the Ring and the Matrix.The extras were pretty good on the one espically the deleted scenes. I would have like to have seen the movie with alternate ending. It's kinda weird to watch because part of it is with no background music. They cut out a couple of scene I would have like to seen in the full lenght film and the aliens were more frightening in the deleted scenes.Finally the girls are pretty hot in this movie and act like they have no clue. I guess it is what you should have expected from a movie like this. A good parady
2,Yeah,"This is one of those films that gets funny the more you watch it. The first hall of the film is so funny, but the second half drags it down with only some mild laughs here and there. Scary Movie 3 is no where near as good as the first 2 which are hilarious but it still manages to be an alright comedy. At least wearth a watch or two"
4,"it was ok, it's just kind of crazy","i think the movie was ok. i didn't see it at the theater but i bought it and the only parts i liked were when the guy told the girl her teacher was dead, when the teacher was at her house with her friend cindi and she was playing with her acting like she was dieing and when she said in that creepy voice""you're gonna die in seven days"", andi like when the girl came out the tv and she was like ""Cindi this bitch is messing up my floor"", and i like when she said "" Cindi i'm whipping her ass"". and i like when she was on the couch eating that popcorn, it was so funny.and i like at the funeral when all that stuff happened."
3,...um...,"eh...this one didnt blow my skirt up...this franchise is nothing without the waynes and hopefully if hollywood decides to still put Scary Movie 4,5,6,7, ect. out, that they wont be as disapointing as this one...its not even that funny...yea it has some really funny parts but all the other spoofs are jsut kind of...lame...this is definatly for a younger audience...but what about the older audience who made the first 2 so populare? we were just completely forgotton about in the making of this movie? was the over 200 mill $ gross of the first 2 totaly ignored while this movie was going into production? Its kind of like a slap in the face, but hey, what can you do? it was still a good movie, definatly not the best, but good...the DVD sucked tho...commercials on TV were talking of 3 times the extras or something like that, and i get to the extras, and i have like..2 i was like wtf! good movie, bad DVD...what more do you want?"
1,Pretty Frightening,"I recently saw this movie for the first time, and am very upset that I will never get that time back again. If someone tried to even give me this movie, i'd hit them in the face. It's basically just a parody of the movie ""The Ring"", except that movie was good. I loved the first two scary movies, but it just seems everything funny from those movies has been done, and there's nothing fresh anymore. If you're one of those people that laughs out loud when ""Chandler and Ross"" get locked in a room or something, then you'll probably love Scary Movie 3. For the rest of us, just trust me and don't bother with this one."
3,Scary movie...maybe not so scary,"The best parody movie I've seen in a pretty long time. Maybe it's a little stupid but you have to agree it's pretty funny. All those famous movies that we've seen all in one funny movie, pretty good, huh? Some language and jokes might be a little offensive, but overall the movie is funny and keeps you entertained."
5,Scary Movie 3 is the best,Scary Movie 3 was better than the first two Scary Movies.Scary Movie 3 was very funny.I enjoyed the guest stars in Scary Movie 3.The DVD is great.I liked watching the deleted scenes on the DVD.The picture and sound on the Scary Movie 3 DVD is great.Scary Movie 3 was a good movie.If you enjoyed the first two Scary Movies then you should buy Scary Movie 3.
4,"Funny but not the same sick humor as the other 2 but funnny,","I bought scary movie 3 the day it came out and it was good. I thought it was funny, but it was not the same sick humor as the first 2, but it was still funny. So see it. Anna Faris, Jenny Mcarthy, and Pamela Anderson are all hot."
4,Best in Scary Movie series.,"This spoofs 8 Mile, The Matrix Reloaded, The Others, Signs, The Ring, Bruce Almighty, Short Curcuit & more, This is more entertainer, and cleaner than the first two, but it still is better, The best spoof is when Queen Latifah was beating up the girl in the T.V., This is way better than the first, and better than the second as well, my advice is watch this one first, than 2, and if you want to watch the first go ahead but it is the worst one, Buy the 3 pack if you wanna, I bought the VHS's of the first 2, but own this one on DVD, i wanted it in WideScreen, but my local used video store was out of it, so I had to pay almost twice as much at WalMart for the FullScreen edition(which in some cases I prefer, but not here), I reccomend the Scary Movie series, along with Shawn of the Dead."
2,"Flashes of the Naked Gun team, otherwise...eh","I saw the first SCARY MOVIE and couldn't believe how heinously unfunny it was.""Okay, in this scene, the girl jumps up in the air and freezes--just like in THE MATRIX.""That's pretty much the pattern of humor for that whole movie: make endless references to other (better) movies. No real jokes, just references.I saw SCARY MOVIE 3 only because I noticed that some of the writers and director had been involved in the NAKED GUN films. I laughed a couple times, but a lot of this felt like the first film (I never bothered to see the second). I really wished they would've left Michael Jackson out of the preview because that scene could've provided one of the bigger laughs--if I hadn't already saw it fifty times in the commercial.I could understand fusing THE RING and SIGNS, but tossing in the Eminem movie parody felt meandering and knocked the movie off-balance--especially since it had nothing to do with the second half of the film."
1,Flat out Terrible!!!!!,"This movie is just to prove that not all good things comes in threes. While this movie may have others leaving them in stitches, it had me looking at watch constantly hoping that it will end real soon. I prefer the first Scary Movie over this piece of crap any day. The very month when ""Scary Movie"" came out in the theaters 4 years ago I watched it 3 times. I lost track of how times I watched it on DVD. The second one could have been better but at least it's not as lame as the third one. I just don't get it when other's claim this is funnier than the first one. Must be the same people who thought that ""Goldmember"" was hilarious. The sad thing is that there is talk about releasing a fourth ""Scary Movie""."
4,hella tight,so damn funny... i loved it... i just rated off 1 star because the middle wasnt so funny.. but i loved the rest of it... BUY IT NOW!!
3,Weak,"This movie is definitely going to be weak, for one I was just watching the theatrical trailer, and it said that it was PG-13!! PG-13??? That means they have taken a lot of the sex jokes, sex, nudity, cursing, violence, and gross out humor!! Which (...) cause they are what make this movie!!! (...)"
4,Folk Music LIVES!!,"Judy's CD reminded me of all the great female folk troubadours of the 60s - Joni Mitchell, Judy Collins, Mary Travers, Joan Baez, etc. - although Judy's voice is more alto than soprano, so she's easier to listen to over the long haul."
5,One of the best!!!!,Ok...you have to buy this!Whats in it you ask?Well....We got a mysterous rich old man who is realy nice to Sakura when they are at a summer house.Then the kids at school have a play on sleeping beauty....SAKURA'S THE PRINCE AND LI'S THE PRINCESS!!!!!^_____^Its funny!!!Sakura and Li almost kiss too(for the plaY ONLY)...Toya is about to kick Li's butt when the Dark appears!!!Now Sakura must find out how to capture both the LIGHT and DARK card!!!!^^Its really good so really hope you buy it.
5,An EXCELENT manga!!!,"Ok, so I know the book looks so much thinner and smaller in comparison to the others, but Book % is my favorire- mostly because of the school play(tee hee!). As usual, CLAMP has done a superior job on the artwork, and there is a lot of humor.Also, there is a nice sweet episode without card-collecting where Sakura meets a nice old man on a family vacation.A wonderful book to add to your collection, and just as good for starters if you're new to manga!"
5,CardCaptor Sakura,"This is the BEST book if you are into Japanese anime. If you are not, the drawings are still wonderful. In this book, Sakura's school is putting on ""sleeping beauty"" for a school play. Sakura is the prince and Li Syaoran (her arch rival) is the princess... well, that sets the scene for a grand adventure for you to discover."
4,Another solid realease in classic Metalheadz tradition,"The first I time I heard about this one and had a chance to listen to the tracks was a few months ago on Drum & Bass Arena.I'm not dissapointed that I got it either. A few tracks took a little getting used to but overall they were all the same deep, intelligent, and moody type stuff I'd expect out of metalheadz. The feel of it is a little bit like MHZ03 but they took it back a notch and its a little less clubby. My favorite on here probably had to be Tuning by Kay and Lee. Scam by Digital is another real unique track where you may not really dig it at first but it grows on ya. Other than that Roughness, Tycoon, Jasmine Night, Sunstreak, Outrage, and Closer were all pretty good tracks.As of right now I'd still say that Platinum Breakz I and II are my favorites but I still found that I could get into this one the same way I could with MHZ03 to a point. If your a Metalheadz fan from way back I'd say this is worth getting your hands on."
3,Shipping issues,"This item took over 2 weeks longer than estimated and was only delivered after I spent a great deal of time contacting the shipping company and fixing errors that the supplier made on my address.specifically -- instead of: 123 any street; the street number was truncated and the street completely omitted -- resulting in the address appearing asmy name1city name(omitted postal code)Having order through Amazon to the (complete) address) I know that it is possible to input the address correctly and the order arriving within 1 or 2 days of the estimate.The extra 2 WEEKS for this order was because of the address error which resulted in the item sitting in a warehouse and accruing over 50USD in warehouse charges!!the item is fine, but I was VERY VERY unimpressed with the shipper."
5,awesome upcoming band,"i saw Kisschasy live in Brisbane with antiskeptic, i was very impressed by their performance (kisschasy was better than antickeptic in my opinion)--- i bought their EP darkside/stay awake--- this is a brilliant band- the leading vocalist has great voice. PLUS THE DRUMMER (KARL) ROCKSi guess some songs are a bit like 'the used', (they contrast from heavy to light- with a hint of punk)"
5,can't get much better,"This remains one of the alltime scariest books I've ever read, perhaps because there is nothing supernatural or otherwoldly to get in the way. A totally believable and wonderfully orchestrated psychological thriller, grounded in class and sexual consciousness, dark with menace; more than once I put it down to catch my breath.Was it ever made into a movie, as the hardcover jacket suggested?"
5,Parks: the next Fowles?,"This is the first book I've read by Tim Parks and I plan to follow it up immediately with the sequel, ""Mimi's Ghost"". Park's style can be compared favorably to a young John Fowles' , especially his earlier works such as ""The Magus"" and ""The Collector"".As in ""The Collecter"", Parks creates a disturbing story told from the perpetrator's POV wherin the main character attempts to justify his own deviant behavior and digs himself deeper and deeper into into trouble. The effect is chilling and Park's eye for detail is evident throughout, not surprising as the book's main character is an English teacher in Verona, Italy where the dust jacket states that Parks himself teaches English. Hopefully that's where his similarity to the books main character, Morris Duckworth ends."
5,I passed the NCLEX with the help of Kaplan!!,I just recently took the NCLEX and passed. I would highly recommend the Kaplan NCLEX RN 1999-2000 to anyone getting ready to take the NCLEX. It has great test-taking hints also!!
1,JEERS!,"Although Kaplan has some excellent strategies for certain questions, it did not have much on delegation, priority questions. These subjects are the majority of the NCLEX now. I took my NCLEX 3 weeks ago & did not pass. I feel the content in Kaplan needs to be geared toward DELEGATION!"
2,Not very good for true jazz fan,Sub par performances by average professional musicians. Made the mistake of buying this after hearing 1 cut on a radio station KCSM in California...
3,The Love Charm,"I love Pamela Morsi. That is the only reason I am giving this book three stars. This is definitely not the normal quality of her books. I am not into ""fairy-tale"" type books."
3,mixed feelings,"as thongs with sparkel go these are cute, and not bad to walk around in, however they do make ""farting"" sounds as you walk and if I wear them for more than 6 hours (walking around) my feet kind of hurt after"
3,they sent me the wrong color.,the item is nice but they sent me the wrong color. I ordered black and they gave me bronze. That's the reason why I am only giving it 3 star.
5,The Best of the Best,Every song that plays is my favorite--True Freddie Fender--Excellent choices of songs on this CD
1,It's difficult to get you rebate,They will make it very diffucult to get your rebate. They said my rebate is invalid. However I can reply their email. There is no phone number either. Big companies won't do these tricks.
4,goodwill books,They are quick at sending the book to me. I recieved the book in a timely maner. When I returned book I recieved my refund in a timely manner. This shows me that they are organized and they don't keep customers waiting.
5,My husband loves it,I bought this for my husband as a birthday gift. He just loves it. So far no problems with it. Very stylish and looks great.
5,Birthday gift my husband loved.,Got this as a birthday gift for my husband. He loves it the look of it and has no complaints so far..
4,Good item for the money,"I needed a smaller watch for work. Most men's watches today are quite large and I did not want this. This watch arrived as promised, is as described and worth the relatively low price. A good purchase as far as I am concerned."
5,New watch for dad,Love the cooler of the metal. The face is more purple than I expected. But those are the colors of his favorite college team so it works out!
5,Great watch at a low price.,"Have purchased other expensive watches only to have them fail. This Timex is tried and true. Easy to set time and date. Keeps time extremely accurately. Durable construction, as I use it when I work (in construction). Great watch at an affordable price."
5,Swingline 650 Mega Replacement Punch Head Kit,"Worked perfectly - Good instructions, easy to replace heads and our high capacity hole punch is good as new. Ours is ACCO Model 650. The Swingline 650 Mega Replacement Punch Head Kit is the correct kit for the ACCO Model 650."
2,Not a book for those with an in interest in music or history,"This book was composed prior to Shostakovich's death by, it would appear, a Party hack. As such, the book contains minimal information or insight on Shostakovich's life and music, but does make a fascinating example of Soviet political criticism. In reading of the various ""excesses"" and ""natural beauties"" in Shostakovich's oeuvre, one really gets a feel for the oppressiveness of the Soviet cultural atmosphere in which the composer labored."
5,great product,Works great and makes seat more comfortable. This is 4th one purchased. Have recommened to friends. Would buy this product again.
5,Great bang for your buck,"If you staple a lot, this is for you. Great price on Amazon. Staples with a very satisfying ""Whuket!"" sound. You can adjust the distance from the edge of the page where the staple will occur. Staple 2 papers together or 2 dozen. If you have arthritis, this makes stapling a breeze. Once you go electric, you'll look at those still stapling manually and think to yourself, ""If they only knew, if they only knew..."""
4,TAIYAKI FUN!,We purchased this for our daughter who has been engrossed in everything Japanese. She has had SO MUCH fun using this! ...and we have all enjoyed the yummy treats she has made!
3,"Different, But Still Good","The taiyaki pan I received was similar to, but not the same as the pan pictured. The product is, essentially, the same- it looks identical and seems to be of good quality. It seems, however, to be a Korean product- the box and directions are in Korean, not Japanese. A sticker with english instructions was placed on the back. Although I am not enraged by the difference, the seller should state that the product is not, in fact, of Japanese make as the name and seller description would imply."
4,Just as advertised...,"I live in Japan and my kids love these 'cookies'. The item did seem a little flimsy because the hinges are loose; but as I've used it I understand now that it has to be that way to accommodate the rising batter that is cooking inside. There are no directions in English on the box, but a Korean friend of mine translated for me, and everything is as you would expect (not too high of heat, don't heat the handle, don't let children use it, etc.) All in all, it is exactly what I paid for and it works great!"
4,This book was exciting.,"This book had a lot of action. It told the story from the point of veiw of both the fox and the hunter/hound, so that I wondered how there could be a resolution that would satisfy both the boy who was set on getting the fox and the fox who had no intention of being gotten. There were lots of exciting places in the story, and I couldn't put the book down. There weren't really many funny parts, though it was kind of amusing the way every single chicken-raid in the whole valley was blamed on the one fox. The fox thought that having a hound, or two or three, on his trail was the most fun in the world. There were only two hounds, though, that he had any respect for. I enjoyed this book from cover to cover and would recommend it."
5,A fun little book!,"This is a fun book to take on a car trip. It has some puzzles that involve math (you know- car A leaves going 60 mph, car B leaves going 30 mph, that sort of thing). Some don't involve math (my personal favorite) such as ""name 10 cities with over 1 million people each that start with the letter M (one city per country)"".if you like this sort of thing, you will enjoy the book."
2,"Get ""Waiting on a Train"" Instead","After falling in love with Smither's newest CD, Waiting on a Train, I decided to try this one. A big disappointment! What I love about Smither on the new CD is how wonderful his guitar playing is and how well he accompanies himself. On Drive You Home Again, Bruton overproduced the album. There are too many musicians and just too much stuff going on that you only hear Smither as a singer. The arrangments lack all of the sweetness that makes Waiting on a Train so great. I would not recommend this CD."
5,"Fair, unbiased facts presented in an enjoyable format.",I watched this for the first time on easter week-end and was impressed with the detaled research and fair portrail of what has and has not been discovered. I am ordering this to share with others and am confident they will appreciate this as much as I have.
1,just didn't resonate with me,I'm clearly in the minority. I'm afraid I didn't like the fancy set and the narrator's voice. I was so turned off I didn't watch the whole thing.
1,AWFULLY DREADFUL,"I am not going to waste much time writing this since I wasted so much time actually watching this. You can tell that these ""so-called facts"" are nothing more than rubbish. They did a great job trying to sell it, but anyone who knows the bible and has common sense can see that not much research was put into this. I found myself shaking my head constantly in disagreement with everything that was being said. I could tell a lot of this stuff was ridiculously made up (and I am not a scientist). Also, being a Christian has nothing to do with this negative review. There was simply no research, a lot of bending over backwards to make things fit. In reality, watching this thing kind of insulted my own intelligence. If you want something that is worthwhile... something that is accurate read the Bible or something else that someone on here recommends. But, this is one thing I do not recommend and think that the History Channel should be ashamed to have ever produced. Just awfully dreadful"
3,The Exodus Decoded,"You don't need to be an expert to quickly get the sense that this filmmaker is too confident in his under researched theories. At one point, he suggests that certain stellas represent the Jews being chased by the Egyptians, based on his objective, common sense viewing of them. Perhaps he is right, but suspicion is not enough to be called science. This guy is a talented storyteller, but a flimsy researcher. If your not too preoccupied with real archaeological research, watch this film and be amazed."
5,Exodus Decoded,"This is a well ""put-together"" DVD. If you have any doubt about the validity...read the scripture and verse the person gives to refute what he is saying."
5,Exodus Decoded,"Loved this movie. It is a plausible ""theory"" of what might have happened. We loved every minute of it. It is well done and extremely compelling."
1,Zero Stars Would Be Too Many,Perhaps James Cameron was trying to raise cash to make Avatar when he saw fit to take money for endorsing this travesty. He should apologize to those of us who respect him and his work.
5,The Exodus Decoded,"The DVD arrived quickly. It was everything I remember from seeing it on the History Channel. Regardless of your personal belief of the book of Exodus, this highly entertaining video challenges you to think and consider all of the possibilities."
5,Very Good Anime!,"I have read most of the Inuyasha books but the 1st one is probably my favorite! I always watch inuyasha and have seen almost every episode but the first few episodes and books seem to be the best. In this book Kagome a 15 year old girl in Tokyo gets pulled into a well by a demon. She finds out that the well takes her to Feudal Japan and she meets a half dog demon, Inuyasha. I cant really tell you much from there. If you've heard of Inuyasha but not sure to get the manga, you should its well worth the money! I would reccomend this book to somone age 13 and up! There is violence, blood and nudity. NOT FOR PEOPLE UNDER 13!"
5,Comedy Goddess Takahashi-san does it again!,"From the author of Ramna 1/2 and Maison Ikkuko comes this feudal fantasy tale. Rumiko Takahashi's best work yet has been accepted by many kids of all ages. Thought it does have some murder and war in it, please note that this was all based on history. After all, isn't history just a ""repetition of wars"", as one of the characters states.Meet Kagome-chan. She's a normal 16-year-old girl. Yeah right. She's actually the reincarnation of a magical priestess that carries a special bond to the dog hanyou Inuyasha. After falling into a well, she coes out of the other side...in feudal Japan (around the 14th century AD). There, she and Inuyasha must collect the shards of the SHIKON NO TAMA (Jewel of Four Souls).Journey with them on a magical, engrossing adventure...a once-in-a-lifetime thing you won't want to miss."
3,teaching inu-yasha,"amazon invited me to review this so what the hellI originally read inu-yasha in comic book forms yearsback and when I arrived in Korea discovered it's huge.My major use for this booking is teaching actually. I'm usingthem for practicing and reading in a TEFL program. highly useful but to violent for some parents taste unfortunately, but all the same kids seem to dig it and classrooms have a tendency to open up when discussing inu-yasha.peace,a"
4,A new twist on the classic Takahashi formula.,"First, let me say that I adore Inu Yasha and Rumiko Takahashi. Thus far I've read volumes 1-12 and the story keeps you engrossed from the first page to the last. It's a great ride, but it does have its flaws. In many ways it is a rehash of other Takahashi works: the Kagome-Inu Yasha love-hate relationship (like the Akane-Ranma & Lum-Ataru relationships) the seemingly neverending quest for the Shikon jewel (way to change back into man), and perverted pals (Happosai, the renters at Maison Ikkoku, Ataru). If you get past this, though, the story is great. It has more drama than Ranma & Lum, and in my opinion, the story's much tighter, there are no unresolved endings, and for this I am grateful! If you can get past the surface stereotypes (the characters quickly flesh out to be much better than anticipated), there's a wealth of fun to be had in this series. So buy it and enjoy!"
5,This was really good!,"I wanted to see the first episodes, but I missed them on T.V. so I bought InuYasha vol. 1. It was really good. I wanna start reading all of Rumiko Takahashi's stuff, 'cause this was great!"
1,Chemistry The Incomplete Course,"I have never been more disappointed in a video. On my computer browser I saw a 30 minute video called the Chemistry The Complete Course. I expected a little animated graphics and pizazz. Instead, it's a video of a teacher standing in front of a black board with a flip chart talking. Not a graphic in sight. What a shame. The title that showed on my computer did not make it clear that this was a part of a twenty some videos set. My loss. Even then it's a bad video. I would say worthless except as a review of a lecture."
4,"Great knife, poor packaging","I purchased this knife for my husband, because we had a similar one already and loved it. The knife is terrific and looks great. I was a little disappointed in the package it came in, because it was cracked and looked used. The disappointment was because it was a gift. The knife itself was a big hit."
2,ehhh,"I thought this book was going to have more interesting vocab, it's very basic and for me not helpful. If your'e not new toSpanish then this may be a waste of money."
3,Unique sound wins out over disc's flaws,"Miami DJ Ursula 1000 perfectly fits the Eighteenth Street Lounge mold. But where artists like ESL's founders Thievery Corporation are known for their sonic subtlety, Ursula 1000 puts his blissful, body-rocking beats right your face. The end result is a pastiche of mambo cut-ups, spy flick guitar riffs and mod swagger over a big beat foundation--imagine if Dmitri from Paris collaborated with Fatboy Slim. However, the pop genius behind this approach only produces sporadically. The slick buzz of ""Mambo 1000"" and ""Hip Length"" dissipates into pointless groove exercises like ""Funky Bikini"" and ""Pleasure Unit."" But, so what. Ursula 1000 is lousy with potential, a DJ with his own sound, and that's enough to make the disc's shortcomings forgivable. Those looking for a different kind of big beat--one that doesn't try to bite off of Fatboy Slim's or The Chemical Brothers' styles--will get the most out of this one."
3,"weakest of the Erskine ECM trio recordings, but.....","....Daniellson, and Taylor along with leader Erskine, are, in my interests anyway, among the the most tasteful players in Jazz. However, I found that on this outing, the band was finding interesting motiffs, but left them not fully explored/realized.The sound quality is a bit too much on the crisp side; this trio's other albums have a softer instrumental touch."
3,Quiet progressions,"3 1/2Classy, uniquely percussion-driven trio work is a bit understated and noodle-heavy, the type of compositions that concentrate more on wind-ups than run-downs. Still, a fine introspective elegance washes over most of the proceedings despite persistent elusiveness."
1,A truly bad book among a lot of nonsense,"Of course, 9/11 was not an inside job. All one has to do is look at the available information with a modicum of objectivity and common sense, and it's clear. I'm not wasting time and bandwidth arguing that point in this review. I did want to comment on this book, though. Even among the nonsense that's out there this book is really bad. At least some of the nonsense is literate. Not this. If you really want to read something promoting 9/11 truther stuff, there are better choices. As much as I hate the idea of anyone giving woohead David Ray Griffin money by buying his nonsense books, they are at least somewhat better argued and edited. I would simply ask anyone who does read any of this stuff to go sit in a quiet room somewhere and also read the opposing (nonconspiracy, logical, sensible -- correct) side."
2,++Nothing New Here. Spell Check Would Have Been Nice++,"First and foremost, didn't the author or printer or editor or publisher or somebody have a spell check done on this thing?Second, if you have been reading or listening to info about 9-11 more than the average bear, you've heard all these questions before.HOWEVER, for someone who is just starting the research the subject, it is a decent starting point. I cannot, however, recommend laying out your hard earned dollars for it. Ask the librarian to get it for you."
5,Cowboy Fan,"I replace all my light bulbs in my car with these bulbs, from interior, license and courtesy lights,this is my second order and I'm planning to order one more set, very bright and I highly recommended them..."
4,Good bulbs for a decent price..,"I bought 3 sets of these bulbs as I was looking for a replacement for my ""license plate"", ""city"", and ""side-marker"" lights.Not overly bright because of the blue filament that's wrapped around the bulb, but it does its job. The white really gives off a nice clean look that I'm sure a lot of us car enthusiasts are looking for.You won't be disappointed with the purchase."
1,VERY LOW LIGHT,"nice white light, but very weak. 5 watts. Used for daytime running lights on Benz E350 4 matic.. Better than stock bulb."
4,"Clean white color, looks great!","Big improvement over the stock incandescent bulbs. I'm using these as bulbs for my license plate lights, and it looks really awesome. Stock bulbs are probably 3000K, these appear to be about 4500-5000K."
4,Matches my Xenon Pretty Well,"I purchased these bulbs to match my factory xenon on my 03 Mercedes SL55. The bulbs are white with a hint of blue therefore matches the factory xenons very well. I am pleased with my purchase. The only reason that I did not give the bulbs 5 stars is due to the brightness. I wish that the bulbs were brighter to shine more light, however all in all, I got just what I wanted from these bulbs."
5,"As advertised, good deal.","Just got the lights and installed. A little brighter than other 5W lights, so it's altogether a good deal. Fast shipping, and exactly as advertised."
5,Nice white light,These are a nice white light not blue or blue tinted which I wanted to avoid to match my headlights on my S-type R Jag.
4,Great Product,"Like my title says this is a great product. As always these types of bulbs are easy to install. I've recently needed to change the bulbs in my gauge cluster in my 91' Mercedes 300E. I want to get something very bright preferably blue ( to match the car). After trying to buy many LED bulbs on eBay without success ( I'm saying because they didn't fit in my cluster). So I've read the reviews, and decided to give these bulbs a try, and to my surprise these bulbs are great. They are pure white, not that yellowish white that you see in many cars. And they were definitely much brighter than my original bulbs. I only rated it a 4 star only because these bulbs could be brighter, I was expecting to be over powered by the whiteness of the bulbs, but I do have to say these are brighter, and whiter than my old bulbs."
2,Not what you may think,"These are SUPER WHITE, but certainly not as ""bright"" as the factory stock bulbs. I have them in my Mercedes. You'll have to consider the trade off. I opted to buy No Error LEDs which are super white and just as bright if not brighter than the stock bulbs."
2,Not worth it!,"I put these in my license plate light and I have to say that I am very disappointed. After reading the great reviews, I couldn't help but buy it. People were claiming how it matched the stock HIDs. It does in some way but it isn't even brighter than stock bulbs. For 12 bukcs, almost 20 (after shipping) they are definately not worth it. LEDs are much brighter, use less energy, and provide a cleaner look. Save your money and time. Do not buy!!!"
2,Not as bright as advertised,"They're white, but they're not bright as the OEM driving light bulbs of a MINI Cooper."
3,Ok product,These lights are ok. They give off a decent glow but they could be brighter. I was really looking for that bright LED blue and these just dont make the cut
2,Blue / white (6K) but dim,"These bulbs are a bit expensive for what they are. I'd recommend finding a well built LED bulb at 5K if you are matching the factory HIDs. If you are looking for a blue color, and don't care about output these are your bulbs."
2,Not bright at all,"I replaced the stock parking lights in my G35 with LED wedge bulbs. One of the bulbs burned out in several weeks'time, which I attributed to heat sensitivity. I decided to go with wedge bulbs instead and bought these PIAAs based on the reviews. Very disappointed - they are too dim even when compared to stock parking light bulbs, while my (remaining) wedge LED blew these out of the water brightness-wise. They are going back, while I'll roll the dice again with LEDs (maybe the one that blew out was a dud)."
4,This is the book for CFA preparation,OK -- so you want to be a CFA. Then you probably will need to buy this book and you might even be told where to get it. Maybe you don't want to be a CFA -- then you will find that out reading this book. The point is -- this book covers the fundamentals of investing from a professional institutional investor's framework (or an MBA in finance student) and does a very good job of it -which is why this has been (and probably still is) a required text.
3,Not a book for the ordinary investor.,"I read this book from cover to cover and although it was pretty complete, it was also somewhat complicated and very dry. This is more of a college text, and benefits individuals best with the addition of instruction. Furthermore, This book is more for the person with a background in economics and finance."
3,"Good introductory book, but a little bit dry","The book covers so many concepts in finance and investing, from stock, bonds to derivatives. Accordingly, it lacks the in-depth discussion needed for the advanced readers. No one can do in-depth analysis for all topics in just one book.Although a little bit dry, this book is reasonably good for the beginners in finance."
4,General Advice Appropriate for Beginner to Intermediate,"Lynn'sSwimming: Technique, Training, Competition Strategy (Crowood Sports Guides)provides a general overview of competitive swimming, and I think it would be most appropriate for those just starting out in the sport, or non-competitive swimmers who want to improve.The pictures are very well-done, especially compared with some other swimming books I have seen, and the writing is clear. Personally, I would have preferred more on technique and less about the rules, nutrition, and so forth.If you are an advanced swimmer (someone already swimming competitively), then this is probably not the book for you."
2,Sammy Keyes and the Sisters of Mercy,This Book was VERY slow! The First and the last 2 chapters were good. But all the other chapters in the middle were slow and totally off the subject. I do not recommend this book.
1,i loved it!,i loved this book so much!it captivated me the whole time iwas reading it. get this book!
4,Sammy,"I loved this book! Sammy a mischevious young sleuth finds herself inside another mystery. A homeless girl with hightops, a stolen mitt, and a crazy bunch of singing nuns help Sammy and her friends solve the mystery for a priest."
4,Sammy Keyes and the Sisters of Mercy,"If you like laughing then you'll love this book called Sammy Keyes and the Sisters of Mercy. Sammy is a twelve year old girl that has enough trouble with school and her softball team, that the last thing she needs is to have to work off time at her church. Sammy meets all sorts of new friends along the way, some good and some bad. This book is full of fun surprises. Will Sammy figure out who robbed the church? Read and find out."
3,Too predictable for me.....,"Okay, I love the Sammy Keyes series, but I recently finished this book and let me tell you, I knew exactly who the guilty party/parties were from the beginning. Usually, there are a lot of twists and turns in this series. Unfortunately, that was not the case in this book. While I love Sammy, in this one the facts were slapping her in the face and she didn't realize it until the end, which is pretty hard to believe if you've read any of the other books; usually Sammy is pretty much ""on the ball"". An enjoyable read for me, mainly because I am a mystery fan, but not a great guessing game as to who-did-it. I'd dare to say that ANY of the other Sammy Keyes books would probably be a better choice for a reader who is new to the series."
3,"""Slower than Molasas in January""","I read almost the whole book and it was pretty slow. When Sammy tries the solve the mystery, the book doesn't give details. I wish the writing could be more enthausing in the writing instead of the character."
4,Edwardian Theatre,"May Sinclairs novel is a subtle and quite devastating disection of a females life in the Victorian era. Stifled by a rigid sense of what it is important for a girl to aspire to, the sensitve and independent character of Mary Olivier strives to find her own answers to lifes mysteries. She cannot ask anyone about literature, Arts or the more (for her) burning philosophical questions of meaning and substance. When she does she is early on taken to task by the very men she assumed would assist her. This is the key to the subtlety of the dialogue between Mary and her male friends.Considerable time is also taken up with Mary's relationship with her family members. This a satisfying book and the reader will be richly rewarded in following the life of Mary Olivier."
2,After Effects Spotty,"As an After Effects instructor I'm always on the look-out for new tips and techniques. While this book provides information on some of the new features found in After Effects 6.5, there is little here that can't be culled from online sources and the product manuals. This book may be good for beginners but offers little for the Intermediate or Advanced user of the software. The authors need a proof reader, there are many typo's and ommisions, in fact the instructions in some sections are just plain incorrect. Screen shots are blurry and indecipherable, the production values are poor, looks like it was printed on a 300dpi laser. If you're looking for great After Effects training you can't go wrong with Trish and Chris Meyer's books."
