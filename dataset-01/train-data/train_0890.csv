4,Great Entertainment,I have seen this movie and think it's great. Nick Scotti is extremely sexy and gorgeous. He made the whole film for me. I am not gay but this movie was a tour de force. A great movie for the changing times. Let's see more of Nick Scotti in future films. And the character Terry was super funny. Watch this film and Enjoy!
4,Worth the effort,"While hardly the universal comedy its billed to be, Kiss me Guido has more than an average share of moments. While relying too heavily on Italian and Gay stereotypes, at least it views them sympathetically, and we are blissfully spared the artificial ""conversion"" of Frankie to the homosexual lifestyle. The characters are allowed to be true to themselves while finding common ground upon which their relationships can work. One of the few films I've seen recently that's worth seeing twice."
2,Not very exciting,"I'm sorry but this movie didn't get me excited or interested at all. It's not a bad movie like you have to stop the VCR because it's hurting your eyes but I couldn't find any attractive elements in the movie. Anyways, what I liked the most was the peculiar accent of one of the main characters. It was enjoyable. I think this movie was cute during the years it was produced and now its value is rather gone."
5,"No Babble, No Boring Trial - Just The Facts of People & Places","Typically I am not much of a Carlton Smith true crime fan; however, I found Cold Blooded to be a tremendous piece of writing for the true crime genre. Most often writers are prone to present a bit of background, followed or preceeded by the known details of the crime and then the remainder of the book is generally the trial and sentencing of the accused; and, more often than not, is written almost word for word from trial transcripts.Not so in Cold Blooded! There is NEVER a dull moment in this book! The life and doings of Laren (aka Elisa) Jordan/McNabeney is better than any beauty salon gossip any day! And Carlton Smith details these events in a fast paced, attention gripping style that makes putting this book down difficult!Highly, highly recommended for true crime fans!"
3,Luke-warm,"If you are used to the quality of Ann Rule, you will be deeply disappointed. Smith often has not researched the history and will generously use phrases such as ""this area is a little murky"" or ""not much is known about this time period"" etc. Very frustrating. Also the time line is very confusing.Not impressed."
5,A most readable introduction,"I have an older edition of the book. I would commend it as highly understandable and eminently readable. While it could be a little less ""wordy"", I would much rather prefer that, than the style of most engineering authors, who seek to transpose the elegant and concise notation of abstract mathematics or symbolic logic or even programming code, to engineering text, with disastrous results, with little scrutiny from their editors/publishers. There is good balance and close knit between text and diagrams/illustrations. I am disappointed that the original has not been updated in newer editions, expanding on IPv6 and newer developments.Jose Oscar Noronha - New Jersey"
5,Excellent book on Mobile IP for a starter,I found the book easy to read and also technical. It is one of the very few books that I have liked to read. I would strongly recommend this book to any one who is new to Mobile IP.
4,Very Good,"This book is a fine example of why you can't judge a book by it's cover. First Cordeila who was looked upon as a real Christian. But as soon as tragedy stikes, she bails out on everything Christlike. Second Tangy who appeared to be so innocent and sweet had a closet full of skeletons.But she was a true nice girl. Bonnie was my girl. Ms Homey flipped the script and got her life together. And last that dang Sabrina. She was a real trip. I couldn't wait to see her fate and she got what she deserved. I almost felt sorry for ole' girl.The author did an excellent job of weaving the story together. I could hardly put the book down.It is an excellent read."
5,Tyner at his best,"In Prelude and Sonata, Tyner (as usual) creates a masterpiece. Several tracks feature Joshua Redman, who is incredible on this albumn. Every single song is one you'll want to hear again. This is Tyner at his best, and for any fan of McCoy Tyner's, this albumn is a must have. It's amazing that Tyner can continue to pump out these incredible albumns, but that just shows his skill. The first track, Prelude in E minor, starts off the albumn with Joshua Redman's incredible playing in a beautiful song. The albumn then goes through several of Tyner's old classics before ending on Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, which is just as awesome as the the first prelude and has an unbelivable solo by Tyner."
1,horrific movie,I hated this movie. Mary kate and Ashley were really boring. Even the specail features were lame. This was bad like most of the Mary kate and Ashley movies are. This movie is NOT worth seeing.
1,"Not the best from MK & A,","This movie was very disappointing, and I've read reviews of New York Minute and it's not very good. It's unacceptable for kids to see. The Challenge is gross. It's definitely not worth seeing. (...) Their two latest movies are disappointing and I hope they start making their movies better."
1,MaryKate and ashley aren't nice!,"I just saw this movie in school last week and I thought it was lame and too mean! In one scene, where the Olsens and a couple of other people are mountain climbing... This innocent guy falls off the mountain and MaryKate and Ashley SLAP A HIGH FIVE! Real nice...(shoves my finger in my throat!) If you parents want your kids to listen to good role models that don't smile at other people's pains, I reccomend ""The Magical Forest"" and ""Smurfs!"""
2,talk about shallow,"I recently rented this movie and I was hoping for the best (before this one, I haven't seen a single movie of theirs), but was very disappointed, but not too shocked. The olsen twins have no talent, all they have is a pretty face. The storyline is about 2 totally different seprated twins who come together on a Survivor-like reality TV show. That's death from the start. But to make it worse, on some of the tasks, the girls end up breaking or getting around the rules (aka: cheating) and it is never portrayed as wrong. As always, they fall in love and sneak of with their 'true love.' Predictable, boring, shallow and a lame attempt at a movie. These girls aren't people your daughter should look up to. Also, the opposing teamates are portrayed as brats, snotty and stuck-up. well, as always, it's your choice, but I beg you not to waste your time or money, your IQ will drop about 10 points."
1,"Stupid, and boring","If you are a parent starting to buy this dvd for your child, then think twice. There was no plot to this movie and was just down right stupid. All of the olsen twins movies were pointless and dumb. They are terrible actressess."
3,Almost Enjoyable,"While I found this movie more enjoyable than their last two, When In Rome and Getting There, it still does not come close to being as good as earlier titles such as Holiday in the Sun and Winning London.The story revolves around a group of teens divided into two teams on a TV game show, basically an exact replica of Survivor (the only difference is that they're competing for college scholarships). Mary Kate and Ashley play twins each living seperatly with one parent,with very different lifestyles, one is goal driven while the other is laid back.The plot is predictable and semi enjoyable, with the usual romance and adventure everyone has come to expect from these movies. The only part of this film that I truly enjoyed was the very end, which will surely crack up any fan."
5,"I don't like the DVD, I LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!!!","This is the best Mary-Kate and Ashley DVD there is and it is now my fav. movie. My whole family loves it! The myans started out losing and they ended up winning because Lizzie (Ashley) and Shane (Mary-Kate) stopped fighting.This is the BEST movie/DVD in the WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!If you don't already have it, get it!P.S. I am a big fan."
4,a good 7-30 year old girl movie,this movie staring mary-kate and ashley olsen is a great movie. i like this movie because unlike some of their other movies it is not revoling around boys. this movie is about sister hood and working together as a team and reaching and working for the gold. this is a great movie for sleppovers.
5,"Quality, Stylish Dress Shirt 1","I was looking for a tab collar dress shirt. I have always liked that style, but lately I had been unable to find any. I looked on Amazon and lo and behold; there they were. Reasonable price, fast delivery and excellent quality. I have absolutely no complaints and I intend to purchase several more in the near future."
5,its a shame this was the end,though the final studio album by this canadian band it was a really decent effort GOOD TO BE BACK is remenance of the old prism sound with RON TABAK. the rest of the disc sounded current(for that TIME)love LONELY TOWN (A ballad)and ONLY HALF A MAN it is a shame the album was the last one most of the original members could muster up. If you like the band you'll dig the album.
5,"Bosch 15285 Oxygen Sensor, OE Type Fitment",02 sensor went out in my 03 envoy about 6 months ago so I bought and installed this one and its been working great ever since.
5,Best Glenn Hughes Solo work,I have many many videos and Recordings of Glenn...In my eyes this is my favorite CD out of all. His second best work I would say is Stormbringer with Blackmore and Lord dueting with David C.If you do do not own this .... OWN IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Great singing, but not that great songs","Hello!I ordered this a couple of month ago from Amazon! I think Glenn is singing great on this album. I give the singing a 4 in rate and the songs a 2 in rate. I think he really needs a great guitarist to bounce off with. The guitarist JJ Marsh isn`t that guy! He has done good records with Tony Iommi, Pat Thrall & John Norum. He needs that quality guitarplayer to do good records. Everyone knows he has a great voice, but you also have to have good songs. I don`t think his solomaterial is that good, but once in a while he gets its right. He can`t write good songs on his own.He needs someone to write with. Lets see how the BCC will turn out?"
1,extremely disappointing,"I personally do not believe that it was God who told the author ""NO"". Did Jesus ever tell someone ""NO!"" when they asked for healing? I can't find it in the Bible anywhere. I actually find it quite offensive that the author would even mention that God was in any way responsible for the death of her child. Yes, her child is right now in God's presence, but it was not God who ""took"" this child from her.God is a good God. He's not the one responsible for the horrible things that happen in our lives. He is NOT ""taking"" babies from people, causing hurricanes, or ""allowing"" people to have cancer for a ""reason"". That stuff is caused by the fall of man and satan himself.James 1:13""Let no man say when he is tempted [tested or tried] that he is tempted [tested or tried] by God..""Why would you need to forgive the God who is perfect and has never done anything wrong?"
3,Good for Numerology of Dreams Only,If your interested in the numerology of dreams this is a good book to own. But if you are looking for good dream interpretations such as a dream dictionary this book is junk it will dissapoint you it is very vague.
3,zolars,"Good lucky number reference, I was hoping for a dream interpretation section, this is set up more like a dictionary with only 1 word entries with explanation. for example, I had a dream about my job - no where in the book does it reference Job, work - employment. The numbers section is excellent."
5,I'm a believer!,"This is actually a second purchase of this book. Originally I had one from when I was 16 years old, it is torn and tathered, well used over my years. I was quite surprised to see this cover still available from someone, I had searched for quite a while and I was not interested in the newer versions (front cover), I like the same book I originally used.The book is quite accurate when you understand what in your dream is relative to interpreting.Zolar is very creditable in the spirtual sense."
4,A pretty shoe,"This is a pretty shoe, it's very comfortable. My only complaint is that my foot just won't stay put, it slides forward with almost every step. I would suggest foot pads to help with this; it slightly helped me . Overall, I'm fairly satisfied with this purchase."
3,La Toya is great,"La Toya is great. This might not be her strongest release, but for example on ""Somewhere"" you can hear her vocal range. It reminds of Diana Ross and is as strong, if not stronger than Janet's. The single ""Bad girl"" was written by Klarmann/Weber, who also write for Chaka Khan & others. (...)"
1,Oh LaToya...,"To anyone out there who is considering purchasing this album: Save yourself the embarassment of having this CD in your collection! This CD is bad. I mean, I assumed it wasn't going to be very good when I purchased if for ...of Amazon.com, but I had no idea it was going to be so incredibly bad. It was made in 1995, but sounds like really bad dance music from the early 1980s. LaToya's voice is weak, the music and background vocals overpower her in just about every song. The ballads make me want to throw up, she sounds like a dying mouse. The first song on the album, ""Sexual Feeling,"" is just disgusting. It's LaToya giggling and moaning, with lyrics like: ""Oh wont you come inside, inside my walls."" Hearing LaToya say that is just nast, she's so nast, this CD is nast, don't buy it because it's only... I'm telling you, they should be paying you to take the CD, it's so gross. Even worse, I hear LaToya's coming out with a new CD. I don't even want to imagine what that one will be like."
2,Greatest hitz,"for everyone that thinks this is new music recorded by her it isnt. this is a greatest hits collection.first all the music is from the 80's and its pritty bad.she just cant sing, i feel bad for her but its the truth"
3,Three stars for only three good songs,"this is a bad album and is everyone deaf I mean this girl cant sing, but she got some good beats which takes concentration off the singing. Now I bought this CD and there are only three good songs on hear No.5 PLAYBOYNO.2 You and me the only song where she actually sonunds good well as good as she can sound which is just O.kNo.8 Bad Girl"
3,GOOD !!!,"i'm not a ""jackson"" fan, as they say. i like their music; sometimes more sometimes less. so, i listen to janet, jermaine (i like him the most), the jacksons, michael, rebbie (i like her jazzy style!) AND latoya AND i like her music.the cd 'bad girl' is typical music of the eighties. a good production and i like almost all the songs. i think that latoya has a lot to give. almost 4 stars..."
4,I like this album...a good bit,"This is surprizingly good music. I think Latoya Jackson is way underrapreciated as a singer. As a dancer, she sucks, but she has some good rhythm. I like every song on this album, especially 'Sexual Feelings' its very different to anything out there and, well...very sexual. But its nice.Playboy (Be Me or By My) is also very catchy.This is probably her best album to date. I havent heard all of them but the reviews are pretty disastrous.Looking forward to 'Startin Over' as its sounds much more modern and Latoya looks great on the cover.Give this albuma try. Its worth a listen. And its pretty hard to find to..."
2,YOU HAVE GOT TO HEAR THIS QUOTE SOMEONE SAID:,"''I can't believe this album hasn't outsold Thriller yet.''NOW HOW HILARIOUS IS THAT??!! OMG OMG OMG I NEARLY ***** MYSELF LAUGHING!!Latoya Jackson is honestly not very talented. This album has SOME decent songs, but this is pretty bad. The song 'Sexual Feelings' has a good beat, good rhythm, but hearing Latoya moan : 'Why don't you come inside...inside my walls'' or ''hmm get it harder, hmmm get it harder'' is SICK. I try to imagein Janet saying that (now SHE is HOT) but now Latoya.The other songs are pretty dull.BAD GIRL and HE'S MY BROTHER and HE'S MY LOVER (as if...) are the best songs here.but I INSIST that you hear 'Sexual Feelings', as you will not have heard something as explisit. +She is a Jackson! how cool is that? (lol lol lol lol)!!Vocally, this album is bad.Rhythmically, its decent enough.I think it deserves 5/10 only because Latoya is a Jackson and she tried her best, I think.Not worth buying, though. Worth a listend for a laugh."
2,not worth it,she may look like michael and janet but doesn't even come close to being as good as them. She's just throwaway bubblegum pop and when I did listen to her music I just shook my head and couldn't believe she was related to mj of all people with that horrible voie.
3,Great line-up of axemen....,"Decent songs, good production... not a fan of Kelly Keeling. I first heard him on some Michael Schenker albums & then saw him sing live w/Schenker. I couldn't stand him. Should have reworked these w/other folks. Joe Lynn Turner, Graham Bonnet, Sebastian Bach... how about Gary Barden from Schenker's band? Being the drum god that he is & getting all the heavy-hitter GTR players, he could have found a better singer or singers. I'd give it a 4th star, but I just don't dig Keeling's voice."
5,a book for children of all ages,I saw this book and just had to get it. I know it is a children's book but I call it a coffee table book. I loved horses when I was a kid and I still do. I don't have kids at home but this book sits on my coffee table in the living room.It is a book for anyone who loves horses.
3,Disappointed,"After reading the review of this product, I couldn't wait to open one and try it. Well, I opened one today, and I must say I was disappointed. The name brands in the grocery stores are quite a bit better. There were very few bits of orange rind in it and it had a rather bitter taste which I was not used to in the other marmalades I have tried. I am probably not the ""marmalade expert"" that the other reviewer is, but this is my honest opinion of the product. Perhaps I would like the other flavors better, but, I'm not willing to try such a large amount in case I don't care for them."
5,Top of the line bed tent,"As far as bed tents go, this one is really sturdy and well put together. It stays on my daughters bed, even though she sleeps like a crazy woman, and plays like that too. She loves it."
4,bed tent,This tent is made much better than the others on the market for little girls. It does seem like the bottom sheet has the velcro strips on the wrong side.I think my grand daughter will be very happy with it.
4,Better than most,"We were searching for a tent to replace the cheap beat up Disney tent that was on my daughter's bed. In contrast to the Disney tents, the poles on this tent are on the outside instead of inside which is nice. In contrast to the Race Car tent made by the same company, the tent is not sewn to the sheet it comes with, so you can wash that sheet. It attaches to the sheet via velcro. It would be nice if there were some more pieces of velcro to better attach it on the one side and if they would sell more sheet options. I may attach some velcro to her regular sheets so she can use them also. She seems to like it. I will say that the shipping for some reason took a long time, which is frustrating for a 7 year old that wants it right away."
5,Excellent Product,"I live in an extremely dry climate, Park City, Utah at an elevation of 7000 feet. I use this product twice a day and then Neutrogena Intensive at bedtime. I have had great results. In the last 6-9 months that I have switched to this regimen, I have had numerous people come up to me and tell what beautiful skin I have and what do I use. I tell them immediately that it is the Neutrogena"
2,Irritates skin,"I usually like Neutrogena products, but this one irritates my eyes for some reason. I prefer Oil of Olay for sensitive skin with spf 15."
2,Not for truly oily skin.,"I tried this product as one of the many on my quest to find an SPF product that doesn't leave my face feeling like an oil slick, and needless to say I was disappointed. Same old story here - the formulation is too emollient and especially uncomfortable in warm weather. Would I use it in a pinch? Yes, but only if it came down to this or a tub of Vaseline. A facial sunscreen for someone with oily/combination skin should probably contain Avobenzone as the main ingredient.In short, this is more suitable for normal/dry skin types."
1,NEVER GOT BOOK AND COMPANY REPLIED TO 1 OF MY 4 EMAILS,"I ordered this book on December 16th, it was supposed to be here by January 9th at the latest. It is now january 17th and i still don't have it. School started 10 days ago, and I needed the book by then. Some woman named Yolanda from cabrebookseller replied to 1 of my 4 emails and sent me a picture of a receipt for USPS saying sorry for the mail service's screw up! That was all! I don't care who's screw up it was! I'm out money that I don't have much of (which is why I ordered the cheapest one I could find online in decent condition) and a book! I'm EXTREMELY irritated and disappointed with cabrebookseller! I have never had trouble with an amazon order until now! I would like my money back ASAP!Joli Remund"
5,very pretty,"I love these earrings. They are even more beautiful in person. The colors are true and the crystals are clear and sparkle. I usually go for darker colors but these are so nice, that i am glad i stepped out of my box.The seller was great & the product was packaged and shipped well.I recommend these earrings and seller.Happy shopping"
5,Multicolor Swarovski Dangle Earrings,These earrings are gorgeous! I bought them for my daughter and she wears them all the time. They go with every color! Thank you!
5,Very pretty earrings.,"I am very pleased with this pair of earrings I purchased. The colors are very pretty and I think they are a good purchase for the money, I am going to look into other colors."
3,Too small,It's way smaller than I expected. Beautiful color though. Taller ladies should be aware of the size of this pair of earrings.
5,Lovely!,I love Swarovski jewelry!!! Gem Avenue has some really great ones and their prices are very reasonable! These earrings are really lovely and will look great on my baby! :)
4,Great watch EXCEPT,"Ordered this watch before Christmas and received veryquickly. It is a beautiful watch, very nicely designed.One nice thing - unlike a typical automatic watch thatdies in a day or two after you stop wearing it - thiswatch goes for days and days after you take it off.This negates the need for a expensive watch winder. Themain problem I have with the watch is that is smallerthan I expected. I do prefer larger watches - this ismore of a mid size. The bracelet is also thinner and lighterthan it should be. If this watch was about 35% bigger andheavier with a more substantial wristband, it would be the perfect watch in my book. The design is very distinctive."
4,Good watch. Could use a better finish,"I really like the look of the watch and it works well, just like most seiko watches. I am pleased with the watch but concerned about the durability of the finish. Some of the finish on the bottom side of the band has been worn off after only a month of wearing the watch."
3,2120 strange avenue,Stones living dangerously.Outstanding 'B-side singles' & obscure songs collection. Superb and ambiguous obverse/reverse photographs.Great quality of this teutonic vinyl issue.
2,disappointing,"Being a long time fan of Monroe products, I purchased the Sensa Trac shocks and struts. About three weeks after installation, I noticed one of the shocks was leaking. I know that things happen, but when I was unable to return the defective part for a replacement, I was not happy. I ended up buying a replacement shock through a local parts store and ended up paying twice for one shock. Be sure to check the return policy BEFORE you order from Amazon"
1,"NIV Version, Not NRSV!!",I thought that NRSV would be recorded on it. I received this item yesterday and I was shocked to know that I got NIV....Don't be confused.
1,Not all it's cracked up to be,"While this product is supposed to help with the glare on your kindle fire so that you can read/play in the sunlight, it doesn't. It makes your screen so that it is hard to see, and leaves finger print smudges like crazy. It was also difficult to put on - kept gettings lots of air bubbles. I would not recommend this to anybody."
5,Perfect,I can read my Kindle Fire anywhere!!! No glare at all. I have recommended this product to friends and they have said the same thing. Making sure there is no dust is a challenge but once you get it on it is perfect!!!
4,screen protector,Difficult for me to install - could not get air bubbles out. My son had to install it but once installed it works fine.
3,My experiences with the mirror set.,Mirror quality is good but the fit of the mirror shank into the mount is not a consistent fit. One mirror tightened up securely while the second mirror needed shims to tighten up and still does not stay tight. Seems like the hole in the mount is too large for the mirror shank and constantly tends to move.
2,Short stem,This mirror is better for chopper style handlebars because the stem is short.I put one on a cylocross style bike that I had to lean forward and reach down to the handlebars.My arm was blocking the view.The mirror needs to be above the arm so the rider may see behind the bicycle.Most Chopper style handlebars are riser type so the mirror is above the arm anyways and the arm is not blocking the mirrors reflection.Installation was a little difficult because the brace that connects it to the handlebar nearly wasn't wide enough. COULD THE MERCHANTS PUT SOME SIZE DIMENSIONS IN THE ITEM DESCRIPTIONS !
3,Cool/Different,"Surprising, showing northeast Brazil, black and poor, not the real Brazil but lovely and different.Could have more known songs. Good."
5,BEAUTIFUL,"This DVD is so beautiful, it really shows how spiritual India is. This is a must have in anyones collection."
1,"Beware, New age content!","I bought this book for my daughter who does gymnastics and is a Christian. I was excited to find similar role models. I was deeply disappointed in this book. I thought this was a Christian book because that is the reputation Mary Lee Tracy has and the book was published by a Christian publisher (Standard Publishing). I was disappointed to find the contributors from all walks of life and philosopy including New Age. Many of the athletes' entries are pretty light on Christian committment. And, one contributer is outright New age. Dr. Allison Arnold is a sports pschologist who is highlighted in the book. She has trained with monks and admits she is a closet eastern philosopy junkie whose sport's philosophy is based on the wisdom of the east. That would be ok if that was known prior to buying the book. I think it's dishonest to portray a book as Christian when it really isn't."
4,A Complicated Multi-Plotted Thriller,"Complicated but intriguing plots bring an introduction by Dr. Barton of Mike Calvert, a police detective in Austin Texas. Other characters in this multi-plotted thriller include a car dealer, a computer hacker, attorneys, a real estate broker, government agencies, politicians, and medical professionals all playing active parts in this author's early novel. Revenge, greed, corruption, & murder surround these characters and intertwine the plots together. The ending leaves an open door for several of Dr. Barton's strong characters to make future appearances in his novels."
5,Far and Away this is the BEST,"I love to gamble in casinos. I have read 63 books thus far on casino gambling, some single game books and some, like this one, multiple games books. This is by far the best one I have read. It covers all the games, has great strategies, and profound insights into gambling and the gambler's mind. It's also loads of fun!"
5,A Great Book by a Great Writer,"I usually don't like books that cover all the casino games in one volume, so I hesitated to read this one although I like Frank Scoblete's writing. Boy, was I wrong! This book offers some of the best information I have ever read in a gambling book. Scoblete not only tells you how to play dozens of the most popular games in the casino, he also explains what your psychology should be when you play them. The last chapter of the book, called ""A Day in the Life of a Guerrilla Gambler,"" is wonderful and would make a great movie. Scoblete honestly explores what it is like to gamble in a casino -- he makes you live it with him. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in casino gambling! Order it today."
2,myths over facts,"I was expecting a book that was at least mostly based on mathmatical principles. I am a fairly experienced gambler, and found many of the book's factual information to be wrong. The author seems to have a problem with Video poker, and tries to steer you away from it, I suppose because it's a difficult game. I particularly found the craps ""strategy"" laughable. To save you ten bucks, let me summarize: Play only the games with the best odds, (other than video poker) Play only a few hand/rounds/rolls, if you are ahead, leave the table,you are now a ""guerrilla gambler"". If you lose for the session, well... better luck next time."
4,Guerilla Gambling,"I got this for my dad last christmas. He liked it a lot and started using it for strategy purposes. I believe he had a good time last time he went and didn't lose money, which is a change. I hope his luck gets better!"
2,Same old same old,"There's very little new here and much of that is highly questionable. Scanning, Wonging, or whatever you call it will get you tossed in the real world in minutes. Also, who wants to fly to Vegas for five minutes of play? Taking odds on someone else's pass line bet, while innovative, is a good way to get a facelift. Buying numbers for $38 instead of 40 to save a lousy dollar? Clipping coupons and betting opposite sides to win $5? Might as well stay home, IMHO. Biased roulette wheels? Sure--guess how they pay for all those lights. The anecdotal chapter is interesting, but Barry Meadow's Blackjack Autumn and Stuart Perry's Las Vegas Blackjack Diary are far superior examples of the reality genre. I also tired of the references to the author's incredibly beautiful, talented, and wonderful wife. In addition, there should be fewer grammatical and editing errors (e.g., cite instead of site) for a professional writer."
5,The #1 Gambling Book Ever,"This book has great strategies for all the casino games. Some of these strategies can actually give the player an advantage over the house. Scoblete is a master writer who can make the hardest concepts understandable. His sections on comps and guerrilla play, his anecdotes about his own experiences, all give the reader a well-rounded view of the casino experience. This is a great book and a must-read for anyone who wants to know how to beat the casinos at their own games! Scoblete has no peer in writing about casinos."
5,The Pinnacle,"After reading Scott's ""book"" I was very leery of reading anything else in this field. But I bought Scoblete's book and I am happy that I did. This is the book that Scott's massive publicity machine really should have published. It gives strategies for all the games, many of these able to overcome the house edge. The sections on blackjack and craps were just magnificient as were the chapters on comps. I am so glad I read this book. Scoblete has reaffirmed my belief that not all gambling authors are self-aggrandizing merchants of garbage."
1,WISH I WOULD HAVE READ OTHER CUSTOMER REVIEWS,DO NOT BUY. THE SONGS ARE ALL REMAKES OF THE ORIGINALS. I WISH I WOULD HAVE READ SOME COMMENTS BEFORE I BOUGHT. PAY A LITTLE MORE AND GET THE ORIGINAL SONGS.
5,NOTHING SHORT OF MIND-BLOWING,"Every time I read this masterpiece, it sparks a new emotion within me, and/or I see one of the pieces in a manner different from the previous times I've read it. It makes you laugh, cry, gasp, sing, reminisce, makes you mad...it'll make you feel so many different ways because as hard and rough as the book's language is, it's REAL. I guarantee that ANY woman (possibly men also) who reads this book will be able to relate to AT LEAST one of the characters here (if not, ALL of them). I also love the arrangement of the book. The detail of the stories and the dialogue, the colors, the dancing, the pain...I love it. This masterpiece has been around for over 25 years, and it's just as powerful as its very first publishing day."
5,5 Stars is not enough!!!!,"Ntozake Shange's ""For Colored girls..."" is a gripping collection of poems about life, love, pain and hope that will tell YOUR story if you can't find the words. I have had the honor to read and perform this treasure of poems many times and I still can't get enough of it. It will take any reader on a trip into understanding, sisterhood and hope, as well as letting them know that they are not alone. This book is truly for ALL girls who have ""considered suicide"" when the world was too much, but decided on LIFE."
4,This is for colored girls,"This was a powerful read, the poems about women and what they went through, sometime we don't think about everything in our life's but with these poems it touch my heart. Now I have to see tyler perry would put this together."
5,For Colored girl who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf,This book is everything.......It was so great that I was sad that it ended.I recommend everyone read it!!!!
2,Hype for What,Such a plain book luckily I didn't pay so much... maybe it would be better if i saw the play version of this book?
5,Good Read,"A must read for all women. I read this book years ago, and saw the play. I lost my copy and was very happy to be able to replace it."
4,Enjoyed,"I enjoyed reading this material, it like a poem reading and play in one so if you are one that is used to reading novels that can be a little different."
4,For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When The Rainbow is enuf,I received this book before the indicated time and it is in excellent condition. The book was interesting and I was amazed the a movie was made about this book.
4,An educational book for the woman of the ninties!,"This book is about African American women, but it would be helpful to women of any race. It adresses problems from everyday life. It shows how different ethnic backgrounds view men and their dreams.The story shows ups and downs of the author's life. It also shows how women can keep on striving and keep their goals in sight. Read this book for your own good, and for your own insight into life. You will find that you are not the only one who has survived certain unhappy situations."
5,Great shine!,"Looks great with or without a lipstick. Also, it came with the box even though the add said without. Seams to be the real deal."
5,Henry James would approve.,"When Cynthia Ozick wrote of critic James Wood that ""he thinks with a sublime ferocity...[and his writing is characterized by] an intellectual daring that portends literary permanence,"" she might have been describing herself. A belletrist always, a polemicist when necessary (she agrees with Chekhov that writers should engage in politics only in order to protect themselves from politics), Cynthia Ozick is our most distinguished literary intellectual (perhaps she would prefer the old-fashioned word ""thinker""). Some essays in this collection are much finer than others, but a great writer's poor performances have a way of not mattering a great deal. ""A Drugstore in Winter,"" ""Literature and the Politics of Sex: A Dissent,"" and ""Justice (Again) to Edith Wharton"" are extraordinary."
5,A master essayist,Ozick writes with the great moral seriousness of one of her major mentors Henry James. She writes with very great intelligence and if her essays at times tend a bit to awkwardness they nonetheless always manage to provide new insight into the subject she addresses. She is naturally especially outstanding in her consideration of writers and writing.
1,Buyer Beware,"To begin with, the listed dimensions are wrong (it's actually approx. 64""h, 55""w, 17""d). I emailed Sportsman's Guide before buying to ask about this and never got a reply (first bad sign), but I bought it anyway. The materials are nice enough, but the construction is about the poorest I've ever seen on a manufactured item. On my unit one of the plastic clips that hold the tabletop on was installed upside down, making it unusuable and requiring drilling out rivets to fix. Other clips have been moved, leaving holes in the trim where they were incorrectly placed the first time. Holes that should be there to hang the pantry bag are missing. The fold-out shelves do not fold out to be level, they tilt. Altogether incredibly shoddy workmanship."
1,Price is a too high,"I think it is way over priced. I don't think it is worth $70. The frame around the countertops part didn't meet properly. The top shelf won't open level. The frame work is really weak. For what I am going to use it for it will do, but I can't believe I paid this amount. Should of spent a little more and bought the one with the sinks."
2,"Looked good, working not so great","When I first bought my cell phone, the battery life was great. I could go for many days without charging. When my phone started acting up, I bought this new battery. Now I can only go one or two days without charging. I don't talk much, so most of the battery power is used for the phone to be on. I haven't figured out if the cell phone companies are making their phones so they only last about a year so you have to renew your contract to get a new phone, or if the new battery I got was junk. You make the call. I guess I bought the cheapest cell phone battery I could find, maybe you get what you pay for.Who knows! I am just trying to make it to the end of my cell phone contract to switch service providers without a fee. Maybe I will go back to my old battery."
5,The New Standard in Jazz,"I'd first like to begin by commending Billy Townes and all of his fellow performers on their amazing accomplishment. After listening to his enriching album, you are left with very few words except ""Wow. That was real music."" Billy has an excellent mixture of both talent and creativity, not to mention a collection of compositions that are worthy of award. His music brings a whole new life to jazz, retaining jazz's old values, but bringing it into the modern world. I highly recommend this albulm to all jazz fans but especially to those who are not jazz fans, or are not familiar with jazz, Billy's music will open you to a new world. Before you know it, you will be tapping your toes, and whistling his tunes, for it is simply unforgettable. Billy Townes is a young, highly-talented artist, who has a bright future ahead of him. Billy Townes has set the new standard for Jazz. Don't miss this masterpiece."
5,Angry Lamb,Thank you so much for a very clean copy of an older book. I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,I think this is a great book!,"I think the Story of Helen Keller is a great book because Helen is a talented young woman and is very brave and I think she is a fast learner. She always wanted to try something new like trying to talk with her voice even though she never learned to talk. The lesson I learned from the book is to always be brave and never give up. I recommend this book to children who want to understand what it's like to be blind, deaf, and mute.My name is Tori. I am 4 days away from being 10 years old and I love to write book reviews!"
3,good message,"This movie has a good message on the importance of taking a stand for Christ, as we put first (most important) things first in our lives. A good family film."
5,The search is over . We have another great Tenor sax player.,"This album clearly demonstrates Eric Alexander's virtuosity. He belongs amongst the tenor sax giants; John Coltrane, Dexter Gordon, Joe Henderson and Sonny Rollins. In my view he is the best 'new' Sax giant around.This album is a pleasure to listen to from start to finish. Apart from Alexander's phenomenal tone and dexterity, he is a polished musician who has created a superb album with 'Nightlife in Tokyo'.He is accompanied by Harold Mabern on piano, who clearly revelled in the making of this cd. His playing is extraordinarily satisfying and enjoyable.Do I need to say anything about Ron Carter on Bass? It is self-explanatory.Joe Farnsworth is on drums and creates a great groove.Like 'Longboard Jazzer"" this album carries my highest recommendation. I feel unable to add much to his excellent review below which I endorse."
4,Eric Alexander almost reached greatness on NLIT...,"This is a brilliant CD that belongs on the shelves of any sax-loving jazz afficiondao, but it's also frustrating how close Alexander came to greatness on this particular album but fell short. In fact the first 4 tracks have a compunctory by-the-numbers feel that really prevents them being anything more than sterile showcases for Alexander's technical virtuosity on tenor saxophone. On the second half (tracks 5-8) the band starts to cook, with Alexander and the rest of the quartet improvising more freely, playing more as a unit than as a four guys taking turns soloing. This is when the magic really happens and why the CD is brilliant. Unfortunately I still couldn't escape the feeling that Alexander is playing more from his head than his heart. If he'd trusted the music more (""use the Force, Luke!"") and gone with the flow on these jams I think thuis would have been a jazz album for the ages."
2,NOT HIS BEST!,"I am a Micheal Moore fan. BUT, this set of DVDs is not what I call an investment in entertainment.Yes, there are moments of Moore greatness, but they are few and far between.Do not recommend."
1,If you want to move to France....... buy this dvd collection,"Michael Moore like all self-hating americans, and conspiracy theorists need to stop filling imprssionable young people with such lies and hatred. there are other cultures around the world that trick youths into believeing lies, they are called extremeists or terrorists. For anyone who disagrees just read, Michael Moore is a Big Fat White Man, by david Hardy and Jason Clarke. Unlike Michael they use FACTS ( believeable by the notes section and works cited section which you will never find in any michael moore book or Crockumentary). Its amazing to see how many lies and how unethically he reports his facts to just make money, like all the corporations he hates sooooo much."
1,Awful,"I don't understand why people seem to be amused or enlightened by any of Michael Moore's films. Did you guys know this guy is a College Dropout? He's probably got less of an Education than I do, and I'm a Senior in College. He also bashes our President Bush, who is a graduate from Yale, and has also recieved his MBA at Harvard school of Business. Before any of you judge Bush, make sure you understand Bush supports the Israel and the Jews and opposes the Terrorists that want to Destroy the Jews.....because not many people know about the danger of Anti-Semitism...especially Michael Moore."
1,What a waste of space,"I do not think about Michael Moore, other than in disgust. What a waste of an intelligent (if he even is) human being. What a waste of a human life...his.Find a cause worth living for, Mr. Moore. There are people with AIDS in Africa, starving in the Sudan and India - and all you can see is the nose at the end of your face. Again, what a waste.My attitude is, change the channel and ignore this man. Since when is crudeness worthly of being thought provoking?yulk."
3,It's ok,"As with everything Micheal Moore does it is about 50% crap and 50% truth. Some episodes are very good and rasies some interesting points that make you think. Others are over the top and just make you wonder ""What was the point of that?"" Over all not bad."
2,The Mean side of Michael Moore,It's easy to see why Moore didn't last as a teevee host. I thought he had a tendency to be mean at times.
4,Good,"I ordered this for my five-year old nephew. He really liked it. The gun holds plenty of water and the trigger is pretty easy to use. Unfortunately, the gun is just a little bit too big for my nephew to hold onto for long periods of time. In about a year or two it will be perfect for him...if it lasts that long. However, it seems pretty durable."
1,Crap,Good riddance Woodie. The worlds whitest Norterno. The world is a better place now that he is gone and his crap music is gone with him.
5,North Side,"This cd is off the hook,it's the bomb.He represents for all the homies and homegirls everywhere including the 916 and the 707.I can't wait for him to put out a new one."
5,fake shmake,"big chizzel is the only fake here, do not listen to what he has to say cuz he has no idea what he is talking about. buy this cd."
1,Yoc Influenced~ Woodie,"I wouldnt buy this if you like the real stuff, u know, non of that fake gangsta crap, woodie is just a white wigger, thinkin he claims norte, real nortenios are latino, not white like woodie, he dose got flows, but he is a fake, he aint no thug, but if you dont care that the rapper ur listening to aint really what he says he says in his rapps, then go ahed and buy it, like i said before, hes got flows, but hes a fake, and pathetic."
5,Savage living Lavage,Ain't no one got nothing on Woodie.That G got the sickest beats and flows.Life stories is the best album yet.Yoc influenced and Norte sidin are off the hook.He's always put it down and representing his hood
5,NORTH $IDE VACAVILLE CALIFORNIA,THI$ I$ THA JOINT RIGHT HERE HOME$ WOODIE I$ DOIN IT BIG REPRE$ENTIN THA MIGHTY NORTH$IDE EVEN THO HE A GUERRO.

1,Blew out within a couple of uses,"After two uses the amplifier stopped working. There was sound coming out but no amplification. The customer service asked it to be shipped to CA. After that they stopped answering the phone. Shipping would have cost a bunch, so gave it for repair to a local repair shop. They looked at it and said it was fried, the whole board needed replacement costing $250. Finally threw the amplifier in the trash and bought Behringer instead."
5,mind blowing,"i read this book,i was blown away...never before had i read a book that linked to my life as much as this book does.for her to to write this i would have thought she'd still be on tv.. her show was great.. the book is better.she tells of growing up southern, how her ex beat her and the abuse she felt..it will make u cry..and make u luagh out loud..she couldnt have done any better."
2,Dull and insipid...,"This is one of those cases when a miracle appears to occur in a person's life. The person in point is singer Brian Johnson. It's a miracle that AC/DC picked him up to replace the late Bon Scott. Why? Because there is nothing in Geordie to put this band above some of the most dull, insipid and common rock bands from the 70's. Ok, Brian's voice at that time was really powerful and with personality, but the songs and the musicians.. ugh! absolutely nithing to remember, I assure you. Just generic rock and roll."
5,Couldn't be happier with this ...,"I just wanted to be able to listen to my iPod at the office withour putting on headphones - is that too much to ask? A friend of mine had one of these sweet little stereos and she LOVED it, so I figured I'd try it out - and I'm glad I did. It's delivers great sound, but is small enough that it can sit on my desk at work and not draw any unwanted attention (don't want someone noticing it and walking away with it).It's compatible with *all* dockable iPods.Volume control is a breeze with these small silver buttons that you simply touch. No pressing buttons, no twisting dials ... it's kinda cool.I've recommended this stereo to all my friends and family who hae iPods who are looking for a really nice ""second"" stereo option to listen to their tunes ...Oh ... and I thought the price was right!"
1,Not Jbl On Stage II,I had the same experience as another reviewer. This is not the II. I even emailed them the mistake and they sent me the same incorrect product. We'll see if they get it correct the third try.
5,Great!,"I got the JBL on Stage B for my boyfriend over the holidays because he would be doing a lot of traveling for work, and I thought this gift would be good for traveling. It ended up being one of his favorite gifts, and he uses it for all occasions. He has had no problems what so ever, and the speakers play great! It's very compact, and has already used it to travel and loves the size! I would highly recommend this as a gift to anyone or for your own pleasure. Good price too."
1,Not what it claims to be,"Beware this is not the advertised ""JBL On Stage II"" speaker for I Pod but the much cheaper and not as good On Stage B system (no remote). Buyer beware! I asked amazon if this was the on stage II system and was assured it was. Bait and switch."
1,Junk,"I read a few reviews elsewhere that said this thing just stopped working after a week. Of course I didn't believe them and bought it anyway. Well, it sounded great for a week, then the speakers started growling. No all I hear is a distorted sound when played. Don't buy this thing."
3,died after two years. can't complain for the price,i used this clock for 2 years and now its dead (but i can't complain for the price I paid). I bought it for my apartment and now I have a home so I will invest in a better clock. Need something more contemporary.
1,It never worked!,"I received the clock in good condition, but, even though I tried several batteries, it never worked. I did not return it because the shipping would have cost more than the clock! It ended up in the trash. I guess you really do get what you pay for."
3,get what you pay for,"This clock fit the price range. It is an example of you get what you pay for, it was cheap. You have to be careful in handling the clock. It is pinned to it's package and you need to use care in opening or it will break. The number face is a thin cardboard and will can damage easy. Once you get it set and in place it shouldn't be handled much. Will not buy this model again"
4,I found this play to be very simple.,"I enjoyed reading the play. But, I found it to be a very simplistic and mundane piece of literature. Overall, I enjoyed the simplicity and down-to-earth form of the play quite fascinating."
4,Heartwarming biography,This biography makes the reader realize that hard work can bring riches to one's life and I don't mean just money. Anyone who loves her job and saves money can accomplish anything. Kids should read this book and take Ola's message to heart. Find something you enjoy doing and make that your life's work!
5,Landmark album,"At this stage in the decade plus career of pioneering turntablist master DJ Qbert once would expect no less than pure brilliance. And that's exactly what he delivers on his long overdue debut, Wave Twisters, an inspired, intricate turntable collage of deconstructed sounds. Inevitably Wive Twisters will become a landmark album, the blueprint for turntablist recordings of the future."
3,DJ Qbert's frenzied scratchfest,"Fan's of turntablism and speaker shredding scratching will enjoy this CD. 'Wave Twisters' is a scratchfest cavalcade, similar to the turntablist ferocity of 'Live at Future Primitive Sound Session' by Cut Chemist. Hypnotic, trancelike, with spine-chilling beats. The samples are minimal, but maintain soulful, almost tribal-like pulsating rhythms, somewhat like NWA's 'Straight Outta Compton'. The scratches aurally bombard you from all angles, almost like spread-out laser-beams echoing in the dark. It's amazing how something relatively stripped-down can sound so powerful and dense. Essential."
5,turntable wizardry and sheer insanity at its best,"DJ Q-Bert throws out some of the craziest scratching I've ever heard in this extremely original and masterful album. Q is a guy in complete and total control of his medium, and he uses his tables and some drop-dead funny samples to deliver an edgy sound that you really can't find anywhere but the ISP (Invisibl Skratch Piklz). It definitely is not a mass-appeal album, though. Some people who aren't into experimentation and turntablism may not appreciate what Q's got to offer."
5,Who's the Master?!?........Q-Bert!!!,"Turntable music at it's finest here!!! Q-Bert proves, yet again, that he is the tightest Dj alive. The Cd enters you into the ill-minded world of Q-Bert and at times you can even picture the pictures of intergalactic space battles of dentists and octopus people that he gives you. This is definetley recommended for any true hip-hop head out there. Don't be stupid and sit there and not buy it. You can't miss this album!!!"
3,Broke after 5 minutes of play,"We bought this sword for my 4 year old son. After about 5 minutes of sword play the sword broke from the handle. The blade is made of think plastic and did not withstand the strength of a 4 year old. We are trying to glue it back together but I don't think that will work very good. It has good effects, however it is only good for a kid who would not play with it as a sword."
1,Not worth the money,The sword was defective. It wont sound when you swing it. I cant send it back because my son would not understand.
4,Outing the Narcissist,"Masterson is one of the few theoreticians [come] practitioners to offer a coherent and self-sufficient theory of personality disorders, including the narcissistic one. This book encourages diagnosticians to diagnose pathological narcissism, even when the presenting signs are misleading. Masterson believes in the unacanny ability of pernicious narcissism to disguise itself and manifest in numerous, uncharted, ways. His is a road map backed by impressive amounts of research and practice. The only drawback is that it presents only the views of the psychodynamic [come]object relations school of psychology and largely ignores advances in other fields. Sam Vaknin, author of ""Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited""."
4,Good solid alterno-pop!,"On first listen, SUGAR seems too produced, too carefully crafted. And maybe it is. But with those second and third listens, each song becomes this infectious thing that swims into your bloodstream. Granted, nothing on this album matches ""Soldier's Daughter"" from their first outing, which is one of the greatest unheard hits of the decade, but for a sophomore effort, the album succeeds vastly more than it fails. Great alterno-pop songs with solid lyrics and an ear for the catchy hook, and definitely worth the price."
5,The perfect sing along...,"Tonic's sophomore release is just plain remarkable. I purchased Lemon Parade and was really happy with it. But it had the tendency to get really somber and it made you want to cry.Sugar doesn't disappoint! It's full of catchy tunes and ballads that you just can't put out of your head. The songwriting is phenominal. You Wanted More (""I don't know when I got bitter, but love is surely better when it's gone."") is the signature track on the CD.If you're a fan or haven't heard Tonic before, this is a CD that will make you an instant fan."
5,First impression: sweet,"I have had this CD less that 18 hours, and already I am obsessed. Every track has that terrific soul-pounding guitar mixed with Emerson Hart's unmistakeably poetic lyrics. ""Knock Down Walls"" will become your favourite song from the get-go; ""Waiting For The Light To Change"" will make anyone cry, and the title track is romance at its best.It's angrier than Lemon Parade, too. ""Knock Down Walls"" and ""Mean To Me"" both have a violent edge (and words I'd never thought I'd hear Emerson say...), ""Queen"" is a cynical look at obsessive music fans, and ""Drag Me Down"" drips adrenaline and anger.All in all a solid listen, and well worth my cash. Expect another, more in-depth review in a month or so, once I've had a chance to live and breathe this disc a little longer. :-) Tonic forever!"
3,So-so,"This is just your average run-of-the-mill pop CD. Granted, some songs like ""You Wanted More"", and ""Waiting for the Light to Change"" are above average, others such as ""Sugar"", are lacking that special something that makes a song great. This is definitely a ""Lite Rock"" radio station album."
3,sugar attracts,"the only reason i bought the cd was for the cut ""you wanted more"". expecting zepplin esque songs was suprised by the diversity of the ""band"". the band seems to be 3. no true drummer. each song is is carefully mixed to enhance the vocal. unfortunate as that may be there is potential. i want to listen to a band! the next record would be enhanced with the input of a member. its a cd you woulndt mind putting in the 5 changer. but next time ill download from the net. not anywhere close to zep. too l.a.. too many babys, familiar hooks and producer like techniques."
5,only bought it for one song,"I only purchased the album for the song ""you wanted more"" but the album got here in great shape within only 3 days. I'm satisfied"
4,A flicker in the dying embers of post-grunge...,"It's a shame that Tonic aren't around any more. Perhaps it's because there isn't enough of a market any more for light rock with an emotional undertone that is significant enough to be evocative to its fans without resorting to saturating itself in a sense of sorrow, self-pity or pseudo-hardship. Tonic are much more subtle than that kind of stuff, but the principal strengths of Sugar are the melodically powerful riffs, and the vocal nuances that Emerson Hart adopts, particularly clearly in 'Queen' and 'Top Falls Down'. This was an underrated band and I highly recommend this album."
3,Better than average,"Well, 5 stars to me means one of the best albums (CDs) ever. I really enjoyed Tonic's first album, and was hoping for a progression with their second. While there are several excellent songs on this album, it is plagued by ""filler"" material sprinkled in. As much as I would have liked to give this album a higher rating, I just can't. Tonic is reminding me of the Gin Blossoms and Collective Soul; their radio songs are terrific, but the rest of the album is unremarkable. If you are a fan, pick it up, but I think a better bet would be to grab their Live and Enhanced CD. Much better."
3,A compilation of early Genesis material,"Maybe it's just me, but I didn't find anything particularly special about this compilation of early Genesis material. With exception of ""Watcher"" all of the songs seem to be identical to those found on their original albums (at least to my ear). This alternate version of ""Watcher"" can also be found on the Archive box set. If you want a nice sampling of early Genesis and don't want to invest in the three CDs they come from then this is very representative. If you're looking for some sort of collectible don't bother. Save your money and get the box set."
3,Review of a Revue,"I have a rare Italian LP of this compilation (on Charisma/PolyGram, released 1982). It boasts on the back, ""This music is brand-new!"" Of course, it's not. I have it basically as a collector's item. Otherwise, not much value for money."
5,An EXCELLENT Product,"I =LOVE= this!! It is, quite possibly, the best idea for pet food storage.Not only is this a quality product and MUCH easier to handle/manage the pet food than keeping it in the bags, but it keeps the food fresh and free from pests. The top is a large opening with a screw-top lid and very easy to use. I can not imagine dealing with bags of pet food ever again.I give these as gifts to anybody bringing home a new puppy. Years later I am still being thanked for the gift. Yes, it is that good."
5,Perfect item,This container is superb. It has been very durable and the concept is perfect. Can dump a large container of food in it and it stays fresh for weeks. Love it.
5,"""Horror At Its Best!""","This version of Stephen King's ""Carrie"" was originally broadcast on NBC in 2002. It pretty much follows the book and the theatrical film closely in both story and production detail. The story deals with a young and introverted teenager being harrassed by her school mates. She soon learns she possesses powers of telekinesis in which she can move things with her mind. The movie is known for the powerhouse performance of Patricia Clarkson (from TV's ""Six Feet Under) who plays Carrie's Bible-thumping, overprotective mother. This TV movie is filled with outstanding special effects that actually add to the realism and graphic nature of the plot. When first aired ""Carrie"" was a ratings success after the theatrical release of ""Carrie 2"" as producers were convinced the public wanted more from the ""Carrie"" franchise. The DVD comes with the trailer and a booklet that features the cast list and scene selections."
2,JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE CHEMISTRY AS THE FIRST ONE,"I avoided this movie ever since it came out,because i thought the original Carrie was perfect ,and i was right. I finally rented the newer version of Carrie,i thought the new cast just didn't have that chemistry like the original. I don't understand why they would take a strong film and make a weak film. I didn't like any of the cast members. I mean Sissy Spacek is Carrie no one can top her performance, and Piper Laurie as Margret White just blew me away in the original and also Betty Buckley and Nancy Allen were terrific. I know they went more by the book, i would have rather seen the original updated with the deleted seens,like were carrie was little and was talking to the teenage girl next door about her dirty pillows but other than that the original movie was perfect,no need for this one."
4,Different ending is why I like the new version better,"Despite the 1976 film being more skillfully directed by Brian DePalma, and despite its star-making performance by Sissy Spacek, its over-the-top hellfire and damnation ending completely lost me. It seemed to validate the mother's religious fanaticism, and I do not believe it was what Carrie, as a character, deserved. The 2002 remake reinforces my view on this, since it shows more clearly than did the 1976 film that Carrie's rage-driven power, when it reaches its full-blown form, is involuntary. One can argue that leaving the remake open-ended for a planned TV series, which never got off the ground, was a mistake that leaves it unsatisfying, but I still prefer this more humane take on the story to the religious cheap shots in the original."
4,groovy,As i find the orginal the best and the rage: carrie 2 dumb the tv movie of carrie is nearly as good as the real carrie.What make it good is that this one is more to the book story line they have done a good job with this one.
3,Sci-Fi Finally Did Somthing Right! CARRIE,"I bought this DVD with no further knowldge of the movie than it was a Carrie film. I personally own the Special Edition of the 1976 version, the 1999 sequel, and now this little number. I am currently in search of the '76 soundtrack.This TV version falls under the same category as the Sci-Fi sequel to ""Firestarter,"" but definitely holds more value to Carrie fanatics like myself.First off, this vesion is more inclusive as far as holding true to the novel. The camerawork, one might notice, is a tad amateur, but behind the special effects, brilliant performances (especially on Bettis and Clarkson's part), and music that strangely resembles that of the original films--one hardly notices the flaws of this ""modern remake.""The DVD contains no special features, regrettably, but does have some MGM trailers that might encourage you to visit the video store.Have fun,GIGI"
3,Worthy Successor to Creepy Classic!,"Angela Bettis is GREAT! I mistakenly purchased this, thinking it was the Sissy Spacek version and decided to watch it because of the marvelous Patricia Clarkson. What a great, updated version of the Stephen King novel...lovingly yet innovatively produced with great performances, special effects and direction.A bit overlong (it was a TV miniseries), but wonderfully executed. The ending was not as satisfying as the original, but it remains a great story of terror and vengeance, well worth watching."
5,One of the Best Remakes of a Clasic,"While I am not usually a fan of remakes of movies especially when it is a reamake of a clasic like Carrie, but this remake actually really good. While Sissy Spacek is pretty much what I think of when I think Carrie, Angela Bettis's version of Carrie almost as good as Sissy in the role of the outcast with psychic powers. One of the things that I really liked abou this moive was the fact that they had parts in this movie from the book that weren't in the original movie, like the part where Carrie as a little girl makes rocks fall from the sky and hit her house. If you are a fan of Carrie, you should at least give this movie a chance, you might actually find yourself enjoying it."
3,Not as GREAT as the original but not bad at all.,"This is not as exellent as the original, but it's not bad either. I really enjoyed it."
4,I Liked It For The Most Part,"This remake of the 1976 movie wasn't really necessary, but it was cool to see if another actress could play the role of Carrie White. Angela Bettis does a wonderful job in her role, and I didn't really have any moments where I wished that Sissy Spacek was the actress. I actually think their performances are about even. I still think, however, that the 1976 film is superior because of the time period for the movie. In the 2002 movie, everything is upgraded to reflect the times we live in (Internet, cell phones, etc) which is a bit tacky. Also, this movie has a surprisingly weak ending. I thought the 1976 film had a weak and frustrating ending; it was nothing compared to the almost abrupt ending in this version. Still, this movie has some replay value, especially with those who want to compare the two movies. I hear that another remake awaits for release this year; what type of ending will this new one have??"
3,Pretty Darned Good,"My only disappointment with this was that the wall charger, which I was very excited about, took a LONG time to charge up the MP3 player. Other than that, it was all great."
1,not impressed,"This product was not what I expected, it is more for a little girl than a mature woman."
1,"Too short, too simple and nothing I didn't know already.","This extremely short book was something I picked up 2 weeks after my husband confessed to his infidelity. I was still on the ups and downs of the emotional roller coaster and had decided to stay with him and work it out. This book seemed to talk in third grader language and stated the most obvious things - feeling anger, feeling sadness, and offered almost no solutions. If you really want to work through infidelity and betrayal than you are going to need more than 25 pages of lists about how some people feel. There are a lot of other books out there that offer real solutions to forgiveness and anger release and how to get over the depression."
4,Great Short Book With Lots of Info,This little book has a bunch of great info packed into it. It also has a questionaire at the end for you and your partener. It is something you can fill out and then have a great open minded discussion. It helps open up the door for a discussion on what happened and what you want the out come to be. Great little book!!
1,Dangerous Chair!!,This chair tips over very easily! My 2 year old carefully would sit down and if he leaned even a tiny bit left or right he (and the chair) would tip sideways and completely tip over causing him to bump his head on the floor (thank goodness for the carpet). We are returning it! It looks like a perfect chair but is NOT sturdy at all!
5,My 18 month old loves her chair!,"She will sit in it all the time to watch TV or ""read"" her books, not to mention the fact that she LOVES Elmo. The chair will sometimes tip over, but in our case that doesn't happen unless she is climbing on it in a way she isn't supposed to. During ""normal"" use when she is just sitting in it like she should we haven't had a problem with it tipping over at all. She loves it and will ask for it if we have it put up."
4,Applied Life Data Analysis,"I don't own many dedicated volumes on this specific topic, but I have used several and this compares very well. The Weibull sections are explained vary well. There is enough information for a novice and yet will still be a good reference for someone with experience. Modern software tools have made the tedious tasks more automated, however this volume covers the theory and has reference material and good examples."
3,Received this as a gift,"I fell asleep halfway through it. It is difficult to understand the words. What is Bryan? He is not a strong singer nor is he an accomplished musician. He's still pretty good looking though. There is one REALLY GREAT song in which the piano player let go with classical sounding music, which showed he had training, but it was overridden by the audience's applause. In my opinion, these songs are not good enough to be eternal and they should be laid to rest."
1,Applying to BluRay Copy Only,"This is terrible. I own a regular dvd copy of Roxy Music at the Roxy, Sorry, this is a bootleg. There is no locatable menu, the dvd extras are gone, the picture is much worse than the regular dvd. It is a bootleg."
1,Are you serious?,I find it appalling in the 20th century there are book still writting about racial generalization. Shame on Tania Wang for belittling her own culture. I tried to give it no stars as one is far too generous.
1,Buying this book is a good way to *not* find an Asian girlfriend,"Quote from the product description: ""Each Asian group will have their own cultural traits and perspective on life. However, after reading this book, you will find that most Asians can actually be quite predictable."" This is offensive and promotes racial stereotyping.I'm Asian and would not be interested in anyone with this book on their bookshelf. If there are cultural differences, I'd recommend trying the same techniques you would use with someone from a non-Asian culture. Have an open mind to different perspectives and assumptions."
4,Celebrate the difference!,"Had I read this book twenty years ago, I might have stayed with myJapanese fiance...I'm a caucasisn male. We just could not overcome our cultural differences.Dating Asians is full of good advice and it looks at stereotypes in a humorous light. Miss Wang examines questions that most people want answers to but are afraid to ask; and she does it in a very entertaining fashion.It might make some politically correct types nervous; but that's too bad.There really are differences and we need to examine them. If you areseeking a cross-cultural experience; you need this book!"
1,I can't believe this slop!,"Being asian myself I am highly insulted by this book! To think there is some mystical book that tells people how they date asians is totaly foolish. Guys, asians are girls just like any other girls and they like the same things. Instead of throwing away your money on this cowpie of a book, buy the girl some flowers. They will go a lot further at winning her heart than anything you will learn from this book."
5,Mandarin ducks...,"...are a traditional Chinese symbol of marital fidelity, companionship and true love, so the cover is meaningful. Get the book, study and learn. (From Old Asia Hand, in and out of Asia for over 40 years with many wonderful relationships to show for it)."
1,What a bunch of BS!,"What do ducks have to do with dating Asians? Are you saying Asians are like ducks or Asians eat ducks? Also, who uses the word Occidental anymore?"
1,good luck if you buy this..,"i purchased this product, it worked great for 2 days and now suddenly no longer responds (reinstalled, rebooted etc no help). i looked for help by posting problem on pinnacle support forums and have received no answer for 2 days and counting... i have now been on hold with the non toll-free tech support for 55 minutes and still no answer... avoid my mistakes and look elsewhere..."
1,"Bad, bad, bad, product and Tech Support! Stay Away!","I own a top of the line PC: Athlon 64 3500+, Nvidia 6800, WinXP Pro card, etc. etc.Pinnacle PCTV crashed the WinXP Pro during the install phase and freezes the Windows XP ever since. Both Pinnacle Tech Support and Forums Suport do not read the questions and send irrelevant answers. They also suggested replacing my PC - What a joke! Don't buy it unless you are SURE that you can get reimbursed in full if it does not work for you! Don't even dream on counting on Pinnacle's support."
1,Bad product... Worst support...,"It didn't work! The support people at Pinnacle is useless. My question number is 041007-000056 and since 10 days ago I am still waiting for some help from Paul (the guy at the support line).Avoid this product, it has serious engineering problems."
3,"Does what it says, but...","As a TV tuner it functions OK. It isn't anything spectacular, but when one considers the comparatively high resolutions that computer monitors produce (as opposed to traditional PAL/NTSC televisions) the quality is rather good. A previous reviewer claimed that the A/V inputs were not functional. That is absolutely false. I currently have my Xbox plugged into it and am playing it windowed on my PC. My complaints are that 1) There is a video lag with the inputs, 2) The provided software is sketchy at best, and 3) Pinncale demands extra money to 'unlock' different encoding methods, (i.e. Mpeg-2, Mpeg-4, VCD, etc.) In short, it does what it says, but that is about it."
2,Not for the serious collector,"This book can most accurately be described as simply an album of the author's own handkerchief collection. Despite the misleading title, there is no helpful information for the serious collector, i.e., research on the various periods, artists, techniques, types of collections, resources and organizations. Also missing is an explanation of the methodology used for dating and pricing.The photography is presented without detail even when a detail is described in the cutline.A more careful editing could have eliminated annoying grammatical and spelling errors."
2,Disappointment from page 1 to page 144.,"You have to wonder if the author of this book had an editor. It is full of misinformation and was a big disappointment from beginning to end. Textiles were misnamed, flowers were identified wrong, price guide was completely unrealistic, the sizes of the hankies were misrepresented, and it lacked any history or information that a collector would be interested in. Many hanky categories were neglected or omitted entirely and most categories that were represented were incomplete and lacked history. I gave the book two stars only because I liked the photos of the hankies that were shown. Next time the author writes a book, she should stick with a subject she knows something about."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING & Full of Misinformation,"VERY Disappointing and full of misinformation. The author obviously did not put much effort into any research at all. Facts are wrong, fabrics & laces are misidentified, origins are incorrect. Not for the serious collector"
4,Greek revival 101,"I think this is a book of rather limited appeal. It deals exclusively with classical Greek architecture, and starts with ground zero. It reads like a calculus text book. (""Consider a parallelogram such that AB is 1/2 the distance from point D (shown) and CD is...etc. etc.) If you want to know how to, with dividers and string and a pencil, exactly reproduce all the Greek orders, how to design all the formal moldings, etc., then this is your book. I cannot imagine it to be of any use to anyone ""restoring an old house"". It will not give you any useful insight into colonial architecture or building practices. It will not help you make your 1760 Cape look more authentic. It's about absolutely correct, formal Greek architecture, or the very very best Greek Revival architecture. If you have a Greek Revival masterpiece, and want to know the theory behind all the mouldings and cornice an columns, and why the entablature looks the way it does, etc. etc., then this is your book."
4,Great book,This book is a great book for pre-law students. I was considering law and this book really got me interested in researching law more.
3,"Poor sound quality, okay songs","Let me start off by saying that I love Sarah Vaughan. However, this disc, in my opinion, does not showcase her best work. Buy only if you are into her very old, initial, ditties and wouldn't mind the clogged-up, foggy atmosphere the recording quality makes. There are plenty of other collections of Ms. Vaughan at her best."
5,an excellent read,"Voodoo Moon was an excellent read. A true page turner. I originally intended to read a chapter a night and found immediately I couldn't put the book down! Each character, each storyline is so easy to visualize you can almost put yourself there. I found myself holding my breath several times. Its way too easy to get caught up in this book. Keep writing Gina, I'm looking forward to the next one!"
5,Voodoo Moib,Voodoo Moon is a well written book. I enjoyed it from the begining. Voodoo Moon is one of those books that is very hard to put down until the end. I am sure you will enjoy reading this book as much as I did.
4,A good resume' of the famous German WW2 fighter plane.,A different perspective on the history of one of the most notorious fighter planes of the Second World War.
4,Cute,I got this toy for my daughter who is 5 years old. It is very cute and a neat kelly toy. I gave it 4 stars for durability because the cardboard trunk it come with is easily destroyed. As far as educational I guess it could be a stepping stone in teching a kid how to dress them selves. I had a problem with the ballerina outfit though. The seams on the tights on the bottom of the feet do make it hard to put the shoes on. Otherwise it is a cute and fun toy.
3,Cute...,"I purchased this for my 3 year old daughter but she only played with it for alittle while. The little dolls are so cute however the balleria outfit doesn't fit well and it's hard to put on. Once you get the dolls clothe off, you'll never be able to put them on right again. The shoes are especially hard for her to put on. I guess we'll just have to wait a couple of years and try again."
1,This book is not recommended,"I made the mistake of purchasing this book without thoroughly looking through it. I saw some of the code samples and it looked interesting. I was primarily drawn to it because of the use of Jabber, which is referred to prominently on the back cover and in the first chapter.The actual book is pretty bad. As a previous reviewer stated, the editing is horrible. Many of the sentences make no sense and go back and forth through past and present tense.The system that the authors built and describe in the book is not a Jabber solution. They built their own IM system based on web services and basically built an adapter to link up to a Jabber server. They offer no reasons why they do not implement a full Jabber server/client system. Their examples make no sense.I highly recommend that you stay away from this book."
1,Do NOT Buy this book.,"I made the mistake of buying this book without checking other reader reviews.After reading a few sections, I was apalled by how poorly edited and revised the text was - to the point that it severely detracts from the technical knowledge that one hopes to gain by buying it.Written by an Indian development team, it seems the book's language was never edited and revised for native English readers. Many sentences border on being comical.I promptly returned the book and have since purchased the Jabber Developer's Handbook by Dana Moore and William Wright. So far this latter book is quite helpful."
4,A very pleasant read (or listen),"This book, which is a part of a trilogy, doesn't let you down if you are a reader of Nora Roberts. It will make you feel good and keeps you interested with the dipiction of the main characters, three ""brothers,"" who have been adopted after experiencing extremely difficult childhoods and develope into very exciting, exceptional adults. The trilogy is about the power of love and how it can overcome extremely difficult barriers."
5,Nora Roberts,"Love my Nora Roberts books all of them. Bought most in hardback, buy them for my Kindle. Nobody beats Nora Roberts!"
5,Phillip's Story BK3,first read 12/2009.....and a few times since...and LOVE it Every time!! Book 3 was just as GOOD as all of the other 3 novels ARE!! Roberts has a GREAT imagition And a wonderful way of telling a story!!
3,pretty good,"This falls into the category of light reading. if you're looking for something funny, easy, and quick to read, try this. If you're looking for depth and something to make you think, look elsewhere.I don't usually read this genre, but I like the banter between brothers in this series. The way they interact with each other and each other's wives is amusing and a fun read. Phillip was a little promiscuous for my taste, so check out Ethan's story, Rising Tides too."
3,This book said very little about Phillip,"I don't think I have a right to criticize a great writer like Nora Roberts so I won't. Although I was not impressed with the ending I did enjoy probably about 3/4 of the book. There were just little things that bothered me. Like for instance unless my memory is shot I thought when Sybill was at the family party Phillip drove her back to her hotel in his car yet the next day she drove in her car, which was left behind at Quinn's home the night before, to go talk to Anna. Does that make sense? One big guestion I have is that if Sybill never really knew what love meant how can she fall so fast and quickly in love with Phillip? Another big thing that put me off with this book was that it doesn't really tell you much about Phillip. To me the book was more about Seth and Sybill. Maybe I just need to read the other series books to understand."
2,Predictable and boring,"I found this book to be boring and cliched. I hadn't read the 2 previous parts of the trilogy, so the first part of the book seemed to be covering too much (as I guess is necessary when it's the last part of a trilogy, but I still didn't like it.) I just couldn't get interested in it because I could tell right from the start how it would end (although there was sort of a twist in there). I would have liked a little more suspense about who Sybill was and what she was doing there. All the characters acted like you would expect them to considering their role in the family, with the brothers behaving in ""typical"" male roles, their wives also acting out their cliched parts, etc."
3,"Loved the Quinns, but Sybill left me cold","I enjoyed the other two books in this series immensely. I loved the Quinn brothers, and having three sons and thirteen nephews I can relate to their antics. The women with whom they fell in love were perfect for them without being perfect. In this book, however, I just kept shaking my head and thinking, ""What the HELL does he see in her?"" SPOILER ALERT!!!! First, I can't imagine anyone with her training missing so many OBVIOUS signs that Seth was abused or that her sister was doing the things she did. Maybe Sybill should turn in her credentials? Second, there was nothing about her as a character that I liked. She was cold, manipulative, secretive, and insanely blind to anything she didn't want to see. I love the Quinns, and frankly, Phillip could have done much better, lol!"
3,Poor Female Lead,"I found Phillip to be another great character by Roberts, but Sybill the female lead was just to unlikable for me and for the two of them not to fit. With such an outgoing personality like Phillip, to fall for someone with the quiet of Sybill just didn't make sense. I understand you're supposed to see that Sybill isn't cold, just shy and unused to the loud displays of affection that make up the Quinn family. But to me, Sybill never really leaves the characterization of boring and cold.Instead of adding to the family, I don't think Sybill fits in at all and therefore just found this book ok."
5,Excellent conclusion to a great trilogy,"Inner Harbor is truly an excellent conclusion to the great Chesapeake Bay trilogy. Nora Roberts ties the trilogy together by bringing in the focal point of the crisis, Seth's mother. She throws some surprises with the usual finesse that classic Nora Roberts. Excellent book."
5,WOW.... I'M IN LOVE WITH IT :0),It is the most wonderful... great book i ever read and phillip is the most handsome & ruthless guy between his bros but the guy has brains and guts u will just fall in love with him... god bless Mrs.Roberts about this triology ^*^
5,Great book.,"All of the books in this series are great! If you are looking for a read that is about family, love, and coming out strong from a broken past, you should go out and pick up this series! You won't regret it."
4,Inner Harbor,"Phillip Quinn has made something of himself. He is an educated accountant and has a high profile job that he loves. He struggles daily to keep a balance between the life he built for himself and the promise to his family to be there for Seth.Sybil Griffin shows up claiming to be doing research for a new book, but then it comes out that she is in fact Seth's biological aunt. That puts the family on notice. The brothers know that she could claim Seth and destroy the family that they have lovingly put together.Phillip is used to women falling at his feet, but when he meets Sybil he is hooked. When he finds our about her deception, he tries to resolve his feelings for her and still be loyal to the family. It has taken the four brothers a long time to build their lives and to become a family, and as Sybil begins to see this, she sides with them."
4,Family drama,"The four Quinn brothers are finally coming to terms with the death of their parents who adopted all of them, saving them from life on the streets and an almost certain life of crime.The youngest, Seth, is only 10 and unfortunately has a drug addict and drunk, Gloria, for a mother who has been demanding money for giving up her son and who continually threatens to take him away from the Quinns. Gloria's sister, Dr. Sybill Griffin, comes to their town to check out the Quinns and to see if Seth is happy and well cared for.She and Phillip Quinn, the third son and a very successful businessman meet and a powerful chemistry sparks between them. As a psychologist, Sybill is forced to face her own issues with her sister and their controlling mother before she is able to unbend enough to acknowledge the love between her and Phillip."
4,"Art is crass commercialism, isn't it?","I've been on an Andy Warhol kick lately; I go through cyclical periods where I review his Diaries and read a book or two written about Warhol. This was my latest find and it was very enjoyable, with a novel premise: Polsky's story is about his pursuit of buying an Andy Warhol painting. Polsky recounts meeting Warhol briefly in 1986, shortly before Warhol's death, when he purchased a ""minor"" Warhol painting (one of the ""$"" paintings). With engaging prose, Polsky details the ups and downs of the art market in the 1990s. I have to admit that some of Polsky's anecdotes and comments about the art world's top dealers and celebrated artists were embarrassing. It somehow gets tied together nicely, though, as the ever elusive Warhol masterpiece darts in and out of Polsky's hands."
2,12 Years???,I have one question. What's so great about taking 12 years to do what most serious art collectors do in one telephone call?
3,I've plowed through worse,"The criticisms of lack-of-plot in this book are well-founded. It's advertised as a ""coming of age"" book, but the coming of age is spectacularly abrupt, and strikes me as far too much of a deux ex machina. Until the end, there is a great deal of running around, talk about issues that are never resolved, and a general lack of focus that left me frustrated. Finally, I don't know if it was just the trade paperback copy, or every copy, but the book had no chapter breaks at all, which made it a somewhat annoying read.However, on the plus side, I enjoyed the lunar background very much, and quite liked many of the details thereof. But with a protagonist who struck me as somewhat flat and uninteresting, I can't give this anything above a five."
1,This is not what is described,"I ordered this product and received a pack of HD-DVDs about many places, not just Costa Rica. This is advertised as a DVD, which I can play. It was HD-DVD, which is of no use to me. Also, it was a multipack of HD-DVDs with lots of different locales featured in shorter vignettes. This is not anything like the description. I was able to get Amazon to refund my money and shipping without difficulty, but was disappointed as this was going to be a present."
1,Why isn't Pumping Iron on DVD,Don't care to watch this DVD but I would love to own the original Pumping Iron on DVD. That's It!
5,This is better than Pumping Iron!,"When you watch this film you wonder what happened to the Ms. Olympia contest where women look like healthy athletes (Carla Dunlop, Rachel McLish) to the vein-popping, manly-looking contestants of today? The movie hints the answer with the introduction of Bev Francis. Though she does not win the contest, you can sense that her type is the wave of the future.I liked this movie far better to Arnold's version, though Arnold was able to launch a mega-career from his movie where Rachel McLish only had a brief and unmemorable movie career.The competition between McLish and Dunlop is fierce and more intriguing than the Arnold/Ferrigno competition of the men's version. Just watching these two goddesses compete is worth the price of the disk!"
1,false advertisement,"This book is not, despite being advertised as such, a paperback copy of the Loeb edition of Aeneid Books 7-12 and the Appendix Vergiliana! As far as I know, paperback Loebs don't exist! It is just a bad scan (full of misprints) of god knows what other book, containing a little bit of Vergil and a little bit of Lucretius. Don't waste your $5!"
3,Begginers Beware!,"Way too fast, and the teacher would sign unlear and the ""student"" who obviously actually knew ASL would sign better! So follow the ""students"". NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED!!! I find that very hard to believe. I HIGHLY reccomend ""Signing Made Easy"" with Anthony Natale...perfect intro DVD to ASL and also deaf CULTURE!"
2,Not good for beginners,"The video is of good viewing quality and basic content, but the speed of signing is too fast for new students. Advanced students can handle speed but by then, the videos are too elementary. I am in my 4th week of signing classes and had the entire class of 20+ view it to see if I was just too weak at signing. All of them commented basically the same thing, nice video but far too fast for them to handle. None of us felt that the would be good for someone learning. I was looking forward to this as the author is good, but was sorely disappointed in the production."
4,"Good ""How-To"" for beginners","Rucker does a great job of outlining the steps for directing and producing a musical or play for church. The book addresses both big and small situations. A ""must have"" for any person dealing with church members and drama."
5,Yngwie The Guitar God!,"I am a huge fan of Yngwie, obviously, and this album is no exception! I own every album of his and this one is true to form. Technical genius is what he is!I heard pretty much what I expected to hear - fast and blistering guitar! Dont listen if you dont like fast and furious guitar! Recommended for all neoclassical metalhead listeners!"
2,bad choice of edits,"So the 4-Skins are an absolute top-rank 2nd-wave Oi band, that much is true. But when they put this comp together (of their 1st 2 albums, The Good The Bad And The 4-Skins and A Fistful Of 4-Skins) they couldn't fit both albums on 1 CD so they omitted some tracks. Inexplicably, they decided to hack off the last song on their 1st album, which just happens to be One Law For Them, one of their best tracks ever! Really dumb. So that makes this a severely crippled collection. You would be better off with the 1st 2 albums available separately."
2,Ressenya de Real Cities (català),"Encara que el llibre presenta cert interès, part del text es dedica per exemple a qüestions de psicoanàlisi, mantenint per tant una aproximació de vegades pseudocientífica."
1,Not so perfect,"Honestly I almost didn't finish this one. I really was looking forward to reading this one, and the book let me down. The writer's style is chopping and confusing. Right off you're a bit lost as to what's going on, and the book just does not grab you. To me the characters are just unlikable. And over all it's just a dragging book. I will have to be forgiven for a short review but honestly there is not much to say. The book had a weak style and unlikable characters, it was not enjoyable."
4,Subdued US Flag,"This is a nice patch, and will look good on the bag I want it on. But the only problem is that when I got it, the edges were a little frayed and that makes it look like over time the patch will come unraveled. (Which may be only for the one I got) But other than that it is a nice Patch."
5,Good buy,Arrived promptly. Was confused as it didnt have velcro on the back but after realizing it used some adhesive velcro and used an iron to melt the adhesive on back of the patch to the velcro. good buy overall
1,Sad,The product was listed with ball caps with velcro. The product came without the velcro application to attach to the cap.. very disappointing.
3,Surprisingly good,"If you are an Ian Gillian fan, this is a good CD. The DVD sections are not great, but the CD is worth the trip."
4,A jewel is released for Christmas,"I have seen this movie twice on TV and each time it is entertaining as ""heck"". James Whitmore captures the tenor of the great writer and claymation aside, Mark Twain lives. I came here hoping to find a copy and find that it is about to be released on DVD so I guess I'm just in time. This video is just good hearing Twain's interpretation of Adam, Eve, and the bear cub that would become Cain."
5,will vinton is da shiiiii-,"if you dig claymation or loved will's noid/cali raisins/pee-wee dinos you need this!!! really trippy with a few parts which might actually scare youngsters so parents,watch it first!"
5,Adventures of Mark Twain,I have always loved this movie since I was a little girl my mom loved this movie that is another reason I bought it and so my children could enjoy it to.
1,Weirdest show EVER!!!!,"I clicked on this movie thinking it would be somewhat educational for my kids. Wrong! It was weird - a winding, crazy claymation story that combines mark twain, Halley's comet, Adam and Eve and more. Kids didn't get it and my husband and I were, quite frankly, freaked out watching it.Note, it was also quite scary for the little ones."
3,Mark Twain is the best but this dvd is just OK.,My son doesn't like it. He is a five years old boy. The movie was not for him. Mark Twain is a world of histories and I think they deserve a better adaptation for kids that age.
5,play it loud or not at all!,"As opposed to garbage like 'Korn' or 'Linkin Biscuit' where you play it.....""not at all"". If you're reading this then you're either familiar with the Psychopomps or if not, then you're investigating more industrial bands to broaden your musical tastes. The 'pomps are one of the hardest industrial acts ever! Mixing elements of industrial, metal, and punk rock and taking them all to new lengths makes this album the musical equivelent of a savage beating! As you listen to this cd it will become apparent how this band stays out of the mainstream. Then when people talk about heavy music and bring up bands like 'Korn', you can look at them and laugh. The Psychopomps make Korn look like Wayne Newton doing a duet with a backstreet boy.666 nights in hell. A 4.5 star album at least. (although not quite as good as Assasins DK) It is heavier and more guitar based. Songs like Superpsycho and Lies are evident of that. This album is guaranteed to damage your ears if played correctly."
2,Outdated ingredient lists,"I use Ms. Solomon's Thai cookbook all the time, so I naturally bought this one, thinking it would be a bargain and a nice introduction to other Asian cuisines.However, I find I never use it. I have the first edition -- with a bit of luck the recipes have been updated -- and the ingredient lists are about twenty years out of date in regard to what is available in American supermarkets. Ms. Solomon also specifies canned Asian ingredients like water chestnuts, when fresh substitutes (jicama, in the case of water chestnuts) are freely available."
5,The Best Available,"It seems presumptuous to add more after reading the author's review of her book, but I must agree with Mrs. Solomon that this book is easily the most stained, dog-eared well-used (actually coming apart from the binding) book in my cookbook collection. Surely that must be the highest praise of a cookbook! I have been cooking from this book since 1984 when I was a new bride in Australia and knew next to nothing about Asian cooking. Using this book almost exclusively I have been able to 1. easily educate myself about Asian ingredients 2. go to Asian markets and purchase unfamiliar ingredients and 3. relatively easily duplicate meals of the sort I buy in Asian restaurants. Should I also mention that I regularly knock my friends' socks off with the dishes I've made from this book? Not only are the recipes universally delicious and authentic, but you'll get an education about various Asian countries' cuisines as well. This book is a must-buy for any world cook's collection."
3,"Lots of pictures, minimal information","I bought this book to plan my trip to Peru but it didn't really have much information on hostels, tours, transportation, or any other such information. I ended up buying the Fodor's book instead at a local book store and liked it more. The pics are nice though. Just don't buy the book planning on using it to plan your trip."
4,Works great. Great price,I've been using this for a few months now. It works great and stayed sharp. The grip is good too.
5,Great for Som Tum,"I use to cut up green papaya the old fashion way, with a knife, and it took forever! A friend told me about this and wow it makes the job 10X easier. I havent used it for anything other than making Som Tum though. Love it"
3,"Solid, No Complaints","Nothing amazing about this little blade. Used to make Zuchinni Noodles. Worked Perfectly.No Problems yet.Kind of wish I had gone with one of those multi blade peelers but this was a little cheeper, and I ofern find multi use items tend to break often."
5,JIMBO ROCKS!,"I've met a Jimbo a number of times thanks to a friend who produced some songs on his last release ""Drinkin' Antiseptic"". Let me just say that I'm not doing this review based on my friendship with him, I'm doing it because I love his music. In my opinion this is the best stuff he's ever done, and that includes the Zippers. From the first song, ""Mean Old Line"" you get hooked into the blues! ""How Long?"" follows it to keep you rockin. ""Dope Sniffin' Dog"" is pure blues/rock. ""Blues Jumped A Rabbit"" will have you boogie-ing. Jimbo slows things down with ""Get Back To You"" a song about lost love. ""Cheap Champagne"" is great. ""Let The Devil Ride"" is a song everyone should cruise down the highway to. Last but not least ""Call The Warden"" a typical country song much like a slow ""Folsom Prison Blues"" that will keep you waiting for whatever Jimbo will come up with next. And trust me, there is more there!"
1,This book is awful!,"I bought this book in the hope that it would offer hands-on techniques to improve my concentration. What I got was a book full of platitudes that are either obvious or of very dubious quality. It reads like something a self published author puts out via a vanity press: preachy, not very well written, and containing very little of any value, at least to me. I was going to add this to my pile of books to give away, but that seems unfair to the recipient, so in the trash it goes. Sigh. Bottom line: before you buy, look through the version that allows you to read parts of the book first! I wish I had."
5,Lovely Sham,"I love the Nautica Havana European Sham. It matches the decor in the room beautifully. When I opened the package, the sham was exactly what I expected it to be based on the description of the item I saw when I was shopping at Amazon.com. It is made very well and really holds its shape. I had difficulty finding a sham with the colors I needed, and I was very happy to find that the colors shown very accurately in the picture. I highly recommend the Nautica Havana European Sham."
5,Great Documentary!,"Extremely well made program. Very thoughtful. A great story told by the veterans themselves. Great interviews, recreations and images of Normandy. Would recommend it to anyone. One of the best, if not the best I've seen about D-Day!"
1,Beware of fire hazard!,"Hope there have been improvements in the past few years on these products in terms of flame retardant treatment. We had a spark from the fireplace land on one of these couches and it immediately went up in flames. Thankfully, I was in the room and was able to snuff the fire out and run the couch outside immediately! It may seem very far removed that the circumstances would exactly repeat themselves, but I hope people are at least very cautious with the use and placement of this item in their home."
3,"Unfortunately, a somewhat dated book","Following the Arcade scene for a few years, I've been promising myself this book once I'm ready to sit down and start building my own MAME Arcade cabinet.After getting the book and skimming through the pages, I was disappointed to find it's either information I've already discovered on my own by surfing the Internet, or the links to additional content or files are severely outdated and a number of external links no longer work. The copy of MAME they provide you is ver 0.7x (Latest incarnation of MAME is over .100)Don't get me wrong, this book is great for those who haven't already done the research and want an all-in-one book on how to do it. For me however, I gained nothing from the book."
5,I wish I had this when I made my first project!,"I've been visiting the author's web site for several years & have already built a 'prototype' arcade control panel. The site is a GREAT resource, filled with extremely helpful & experienced people, but I feel that I would have been MUCH happier with my project if I'd have had this book next to me the whole time. What the book does a great job of doing is consolidating all of the information available on the web & using it to provide a reference project to work by. This book has inspired me to begin planning a full arcade cabinet & it will be the FIRST place I look to guide me through its construction."
2,Outdated. Most links do not work anymore.,This book has not been updated. Most online links are gone and the companies that supplies the controllers/parts are defunct now.Well written but not worth it.
2,Introduction to InfoMaker 7.0,"Very shallow, limited, not to be used as a reference, but as a notebook for a class. If you're taking the class - fine, but not worth it without."
3,drum pad,"its ok if its all you can afford, the only reason i dont like it is because it moves around alot whenever you are playing on it... other than that a good buy"
5,HOW TO BE HAPPY AND HAVE EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN LIFE!,"I have read over 600 self help books in my life and so far this little book is the best one yet. Direct and to the point, power packed on every page, and fun to read. It has the best information on how to REALLY create what you want in your life. It really works and it FEELS GOOD! Don't let the small size fool you! Every page will astound you with some of the most valuable AND USABLE information you'll ever find. I have given this book as gifts to all my friends and every person I gave this book to has thanked me over and over and told me how it has changed their lives. It has changed mine as well. The information in this book is directly responsible for my perfect mate, who is now my wife; my salary increased by $30,000 in 1998; and I am now the adored manager of a prominent firm! Don't let another day go by without this valuable little gem."
5,EXCELLENT,"Item arrived in excellent conditions!I'm a big fan of ANOES, and could't find it anywhere!Great Purchase!"
1,"An impulse buy, makes me want to stop impulse buying...","The animation was cool, but the storyline lacked a whole lot of substance. This movie needs a lot more background information for it to be interesting. Also, remember the speeder chase through the forest in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi? Well, expect to hear those very sound bytes for the alien fighters in this movie..."
3,Not bad but not exactly great either,"I had mixed feelings about this anime. For one, it felt too short for the story it was trying to tell. While the plot was interesting it just didn't feel as intense as it probably should have. And I was slightly disappointed by the quality of the animation. And the whole notion of nymphomania as a symptom of Gods brain-washing seemed merely like an excuse to include a couple of brief uninspired sex scenes rather than a plot device."
2,"Ok, a bit disappointing though","This movie was rather dissapointing to me. If you like action anime movies then steer clear of this one, it doesn't have too much action, except towards the end. The animation is also rather lacking and is rather outdated, for instance, lots of time when one character is moving and talking the rest of the screen is completely still"
1,Horrible film is a nonstop freak show,"Mundane, bottom-of-the-barrel futuristic STAR WARS - type movie, tracks the exploits of a land battleship called the Aeoba and its captain as they battle it out in long, dreary fight scenes. Nonstop parade of slimy, repulsive effects turns this into a freak show and drowns most of the action. 1 star is too good for this piece of trash."
2,Stolen Lives,"I heard the author interviewed on the radio and was looking forward to reading this book. When I finally got it I was disappointed. There wasn't a lot of what I would consider ""new"" useful information. Mostly a rehash of common sense suggestions most people probably already know. Glad I got it used and didn't pay full price."
5,Captivating Read!,"I truly did not want to put this book down! It captivates you from the beginning to end! It's one of those ""on the edge of your seat! What's going to happen next?"" kind of books! Sherry, I do hope that you will write a sequel to this to let us know what is happening later on in the characters lives! I want to know! :-)Latisha Crubaughwww.YummyCandles.biz"
4,"Awesome, an easy read, simply captivating!","I was impressed with how the thoughts flowed, how she handled the paragraph transitions, and her nice crisp paragraphs. She captured the feelings of someone caught in an abusive situation, I could feel the fear, and was relieved with the hope she offers anyone caught in simliar situation. The book was simply captivating and hope others read it to, if only for enjoyment."
2,potential but many minuses,"the annual Robinson family BBQ. Much hilarity and drama ensue. The first and biggest problem: ultra low budget. Looks and sounds like it was shot on a hi 8 camcorder. It is terrible quality as far as piture and sound. It is quite long as well. Every social issue is covered; interracial relationships, AIDS, homosexuality, hip hop, dead beat dads, domestic violence, infidelity, infertility, education, discipline ...etc. and it starts to drag. Some of the humor was very funny and it was at times very dramatic and well directed. With more money and tighter editing and direction this film could have been great. Unfortuntely it falls far from the mark. Amusing. Rent it if you must, however I don't think most people besides Phamily will want to spend their money on this."
1,Worst Movie EVER!,"This is the worst movie ever! It has beaten out other bad movies in a ""bad movie contest"", where we watch both bad movies back to back and then vote. The first time I saw this movie, it was the hardest movie to sit through because it feels like 3 hrs but now I love it because it's so bad, it's funny. This movie does have every social issue and also includes a song ""blood is thicker than BBQ sauce"" and also includes random farting throughout this SPECIAL movie."
4,Really Really like it,I am very happy with this watch so far it looks good is easy to read with my over 50year old eyes just one problem the stem has come up while I was wearing it and this has caused it to stop. If it had a screw down stem I think this might be the perfict watch for me. It seems a great value a friend with a Omega Speedmaster gave it an admiring look that seemed to say what did I get for my extra $1500. Well something I guess but still.
1,Does not wotk with Intel based Macs,I bought it because it stated that it was compatible with Mac OS X 10.2 or later. Well I have a Mac pro and the mouse cannot be configured because it is not compatible with Intel based Macs.
2,Price = quality.,"I've bought this mouse to work on my Mac.After 1 year of using i've found that it is very clanky - all buttons too noisy and left (that is main for right-handed) stop working well and i'm decided to use only right button as main. The middle scroll circle is made awful - it's not smooth, noisy and move jerking - i'm try to not use it at all.So, the conclusion is - you get what you pay. This mouse is cheap and it was made with cheap details.Want something good - find mouse that costs more."
3,Mouse accuracy,"I really like the mouse as far as size, comfort, buttons work well, etc.....I have one at home and one at work, and find that the accuracy is poor. Meaning, if I try to expand a window, and put the mouse on the corner and get the double-arrows, sometimes I'll just bring up the window that's behind the one I want to expand.... so I see the double arrows, but the mouse is working a few pixels off. The same goes for highlighting text. Sometimes I'll miss a letter at the end of the string.Both mouses work that way."
3,Re: Great mouse... Questionable quality,"As follow-on to KDH's review above (Nov 10 '08), this mouse feels great, but quality is its downfall. My scroll wheel died about six months ago, and tonight my left mouse button died -- I've set one of the side buttons as left-click for now. (And there are no loose screws.)A shame, really, since it's a well-designed, comfortable mouse, but it hasn't stood up to everyday use."
4,Perfect,"This is my third of these. Love the shape and feel, with the rubber side grips. Also like have page forward and page back buttons"
3,Not for the mildly interested,"I bought this book after purchasing Building Construction Before Mechanization, which is one of the best books I have ever read, and I highly recommend it. Inspired to read more of John Fitchen's work, I bought this guy, and it is incredibly detailed. If you have specialized interest in New England Dutch barns, this will be a good read for you. If you have a more general interest in timber framed structures, it won't be."
4,Excellent documentary delving deeper in Austen's life!!,"This is a great Jane Austen documentary, that delves deeper into Austen's life; Informative and educational, as well as interesting, narrarated by a man with a fun British accent!This DVD tours the countryside, showing places and things having to do with Jane and her life. It offers some insight into Jane's views on things, what society and life was like for her at that time, and where she would have vacationed, what she would have done, etc.I enjoyed this very much, and I'm sure you will too! Highly recommended to any fan of Jane Austen!!"
2,"Very British, Very Boring","While there is a wealth of facts and items of interest presented here they are given in such a dry manner as to cause one's mind to wander. In particular, the narrator has all the charm and charisma of Miss Austen's least desirable male characters -- I would prefer a Mr. Collins sermon to this dull and droning creature!Perhaps A&E;, the BBC or another organization will take the content of this well intentioned but compromised shoestring production and do something that engages and entertains while it educates.Jane Austen deserves better."
3,Semi-Yawn...,The video was fairly informative but the narrator had a tendancy to stray. There were a few too many shots of flowers as well.
3,An okay documentary...,"It is an hour long tour of all that is Austen. Where she was born, various places that she lived and then where she died. The in-between places consist of her life with her family, and all about her family."
2,Less then expected,"Well you get what you pay for. Extremely light weight links are cheap, clasp the same broke first day. Looks very nice, however smaller then thought and the paws are hollow. Just no quality. Worth $12.00 at most. I'm half Native American and so is the wife and we both love the looks but that's as far as it go's. As part Native american I'm embarssed."
3,Case for Gigabeat 40/GB / 60GB,"I like the design of the case. I don't like the idea that you have to remove the case each time you have to download music or recharge the battery.(BAD, BAD, BAD)"
4,Case for Gigabeat 40GB/60GB,Great little cover. The only thing keeping from a 5 is the fact that you can't use it with the Toshiba Docking station.
2,Doesn't really fit,"This is a really nice case that doesn't really fit the 60 G Gigabeat. The buttons and such on the case just don't lign up properly making it difficult to use the gigabeat controls by touch. Also, the sc reen protector slides around and would probably damage the screen, more tham the inside of my pocket."
5,The Wright way to restoration,"Excellent documentary hosted by architectural historian H. Allen Brooks. The colors and music are fantastic. Gives more insight as to hat Wright was accomplished in the original ""Prairie style ""design and how they could recapture the design and still incorporate today's technology."
4,Helpful,"This little, and I mean little, book is packed with good history and great information. If you are traveling to Latvia it is a great resource!"
5,A Necessary Album,"You absolutely need this if you are at all interested in punk rock. It is more poppy than their debut but better than Leave Home. The best songs, in my opinion are the simplest ones: Surfing Bird and Happy Family. This is one of my favorite all-time albums. Throw away your Blink 182 ... and get into the Ramones."
5,Sheena Is a Punk Rocker,"the ramones best. this is like one of the first 10 albums i ever owned . i even had 8 track tape to listen to in the car. to this day it is still my favorite ramones release and any fan of punk music should own this ,"
5,great historical recording,"I got into the ramones in the late middle 70's when music was the pits and then I heard Rocket to Russia. I think that it is one of Rock's best albums made both in beat and vocals. I think it is a well written album and signifies the idea that punk was fun yet political in nature.I highly reccomend this album as well as the Live album,anthology which is a good chronilogical representation and pleasent Dreams."
5,Punk Pop Perfection,"""Ramones"" (1976) and ""Leave Home"" (1977) were the birth of punk, but their third album ""Rocket To Russia"" signaled further growth. They incorporated more pop and melody into their fast and furious sound in an attempt to be accessible. It worked. ""Sheena Is A Punk Rocker"" and ""Rockaway Beach"" were the closest they ever came to having hit singles.The fact that it includes such famous tracks as ""Cretin Hop"", ""We're A Happy Family"", ""Teenage Lobotomy"", and ""Ramona"" only sweetens the pot. Well-chosen covers ""Do You Wanna Dance?"" and ""Surfin' Bird"" really seal the deal. Great bonus tracks? Yep, plenty of 'em. This CD is a must-have.I love all 14 Ramones studio albums, but favor the first 7 (up to and including 1983's ""Subterranean Jungle""). After that they took on a metal edge. Still great, but different. Hugely influential, always humorous, engaging as all-get-out - the Ramones are a band for the ages. Don't miss them!"
1,"Great music, horrible vinyl quality","First off, the music is fantastic! But Rhino Vinyl is nothing but junk! I've bought albums from many different establishments and 3/4 of the Rhino Vinyl albums I buy new do not play in any of our turn tables. They skip all over the place and it's not listenable nor enjoyable. Even repurchases of the exact same album from different stores in different months have found to skip in the exact same spot. I will not be buying a Rhino Vinyl product again."
5,Their best.,"Here we have what I consider to be the best album by the best Punk group of all time: the Ramones' 'Rocket to Russia'. This edition includes all of the original songs like Surfin' Bird and Rockaway Beach, and also features demos and B-sides as bonus tracks. This CD edition, along with the deluxe editions of the rest of their albums, will be a welcome addition to any fan's collection. GabbaGabbaHey."
4,Good film; yet a tad on the overlong side,"MRS. MINIVER is a very poignant and touching film experience filled with a great cast and a lasting message. Although it is not a landmark motion picture, it still provides a perception of the Second World War and how it was like on the English side for a family having to split up and decide their fates. The only problems are the fact that it feels like a soap opera often dragging on for over two hours and that the Miniver family, although portrayed by masterful actors, isn't as completely convincing as it should have been. Quite watchable, but never works entirely."
3,British family album.,"Some people say: ""The best movie I have ever seen in my life"", but I think in its time (1942) this was a great movie, now a remembrance of old techniques. Example: It looks as pencil drawings of the city of London, boats that are simply animated cartoons, and the mansion of Miniver Family seems as a postal card stamp. To recapitulate, the plot was simple, appealing to a superficial nationalism, without deep roots of convictions. Why are two women alone in the middle of a battle? Where was Mr. Miniver? What was he doing, he left these two women in this dangerous moment? Else, the rose contest was very ""kinder garden"" like activity. In addition, the man of Mrs. Miniver rose seems fool in its acting manners. To recapitulate, it was a family album story."
5,So far so good,"I love these old movies. I love the simplicity of them and that I can let my 10 year old watch with me without worrying about the content. I really liked ""An American In Paris"" (how can you not with Gene Kelly) and ""Casablanca"" but have not watched the others yet. For the price you can't go wrong."
5,The war movie without the soldiers,"This film highlights the resilient nature of the British in the face of adversity. The movie begins before the war with the typical middle-class family. You learn their joys and their everyday concerns. Then, the message comes to let them know that war, WWII, has started.Greer Garson plays Mrs. Miniver who is at the center of the story. Her oldest son has enlisted as a pilot and serves to defend England in the Battle of Britain. Her husband works with a civil defense unit and helps to evacuate soldiers at Dunkirk. Through all this, you see her continue life, as hard as it is, with a positive attitude and a stiff upper-lip.If you are a fan of war movies, I would highly recommend seeing this movie. It not only provides a contrast, but allows you to see another facet of war. A great movie."
5,LOVE it!,"Great family movie, thought provoking for discussion about what is really important about how we live our lives. It came highly recommended to our family of 9 and we highly recommend it to others. There is much to be learned in our day from the WWII era."
1,It states the obvious,"I am an experienced instructor. I purchase many books about training, based on recommendations and reviews here and elsewhere. Most of them have new and interesting ideas contained in them.I found this book to state the obvious. It did not offer a single useful suggestion about how to deal with presentation, classroom, students, preparation or any other item.If you have a tinge of common sense, and have taught in the classroom even a few times, you will not find anything new here.I have no opinion as to whether novice instructors would benefit from reading this book. Clearly, experienced instructors would not. I.e. this book, at most it will get you to one step beyond novice. It will definitely not get you to be a ""master""."

2,Yoga Power without Power,"Although a good basic yoga video for beginners, the title is misleading. There is no power associated with this video."
5,"Clear instructions, great for any level","It is typical Karen Voight fitness CD - clear instructions and great editing. She gives you simple, easy to follow instructions and shows you very clearly how it is done. Her words are concise and her voice is calm. I am new to Yoga but I had no problem following her routines."
2,Light workout,"THis disc is for someone not in such good shape and who wants a light, quick, yoga routine. The instructor is middle-aged, and kind of has that middle-aged energy (I am also middle-aged!). There is not much depth in the commentary or focus on personal transformation. The scenery looks like your living room floor. Some of the poses are over-held and burn your thighs. I am not a huge fan of this disc."
4,Great yoga video,The two yoga workouts on this dvd are perfectly contrasted. The Yoga Strength is a great workout that's challenging and strenuous. It's especially good for people who want to work on their balance. The other workout is a stretching yoga workout that helps you gain flexibility and really stretch out your muscles. I like to alternate between the two workouts doing the more strenuous yoga one day then the stretching yoga the next.
4,Well researched and written,"Keith D. Miller does a good job examining the sources of Martin Luther King Jr. and explaining their significance. King was very successfull as the leader of the Civil Rights Movement in America because he effectively appealed to many white moderates. By quoting the founding fathers he was able to appeal to the broader American tradition. By borrowing and blending from black and white tradtions of speech and language, King was all the more effective at uniting people. There is obviously a considerable amount of informaton on Ghandi within Miller's publication. I think much more attention should have been focused on King's borrowing from Aquinas and natural law, which is so clearly evident in King's ""Letter From A Birmingham Jail."" I found it also interesting that King borrowed sources from contemporary white preachers as well as historical figures. Of all the criticisms you could throw at King, he was still very very intelligent."
3,Works for me,"I bought this as a gift to myself.The sellers were great! The package arrived on time with all the components they listed, as promised.I use the SanDisk Sansa e280 to listen to music, and watch small video clips.Points that it lacks for me...1. No ability to listen to AM talk radio stations.2. Cannot fast forward or rewind videos.Only allows to pause and play videos from the beginning.Other than that, I like the product."
5,e280 a great mp3 player,"The sansa e280 is a great mp3 player. It is my second one,I bought a refurb from another outfit and it crashed. I still liked the unit enough to risk a new one. I fully loaded it and have been using it for a month and it has been great! Buy this unit......New not refurb."
2,screen too fragile,"This my 2nd Sansa that I purchased because of the over sensitive screen. If breathe on the screen the wrong way it will crack, even if you the protective covering. It takes too long to upload to your PC. It worked fairly decent. Hope fully Sansa will do something about the screen. It should not crack if you have the unit in your pocket unless you hit it with a hammer or something. I will wait until the Zune 8 GB go on sale on amazon. Right now it runs about $180.00, but in Feb, March it will be around the low $100's."
3,Not there yet,"Why I bought the e280: Small, light, long battery life, didn't care for video playback, not an iPod, large flash storage space (still not enough for all my music though), $[...] coupon at Costco, FM, voice and FM recorder, IT guy at work has 2 gig version, and finally I just liked it.Why I returned the e280: poor sound quality even with nicer headphones, can't delete from e280 (has to be done from computer), playlists are difficult (must sync with 3rd party software and then to delete manually using computer), lack of good software (relies on 3rd party), and not enough storage (but I knew that going in).I tried to like my e280. I was disappointed over an over again and my wife could tell I just didn't like it. What finally did it for me was helping my mother-in-law set up her iPod Shuffle she got for her birthday. It was all so simple and seamless! I returned my e280 and I'm going to get an iPod."
2,"Nice screen, good value, but awkward and unreliable","Looks nice, easy to sync, good battery life.But I had to return it because it was locking up from the beginning even after the firmware upgrade. Described features were missing until I did the upgrade. Buttons are hard to get to with the raised circular control (that ring-thing rotates in addition to the center button clicking). Doesn't have a sleep timer or bookmarks, and annoying to select an album one has to select the album and then the first song to play the album."
4,I love my MP3,I Love this product. It is easy to use and to download music. I highly recommend this product.
5,Sansa E280,"Robust features of this Sansa make the ipod nano pale in comparison, for the price. Easy to use, easy to transfer files. Good size display for the photos and videos converted by the Sansa utility. Battery is user replaceable and costs around $15, something that can't be done with the ipod (except by factory ($$$) or a good hacker)... Cannot comment on reliability yet, have only been using for a month or so. Two methods to tranfer, one can be used with Media Player or Itunes, etc, automatically syncs up your music library to the player. Other method is like a USB drive, drop & drag.Cons:Charging through USB must finish before you can transfer files. Recommend an extra wall charger/car charger, - inexpensive gadgets. Charge it up before you connect to PC. I also recommend a case or silicone cover and display shield. Will keep it from getting scratched up. Earbuds not so good, but easily replaced with better."
1,Poor customer support !,"I've bought two sansas.One went dead after 4 months of use... a problem known as 'Blue Ring'. All of the sudden it went dead... I was disconnecting Sansa from Rhapsody and pooff... the blue ring goes on but nothing else happens.If you search the web foruns you will find a lot of people with the same problem... but try to find a solution in Sansa's website.. no way !Sandisk: be responsible for what you sell and find a way to solve this... I don't want to spend my money on products with such poor quality.If you are looking for a player, beware."
4,sandisk Sansa e280 8gb MP3 player,I purchased 3 of these MP3 players. They did not have an installation CD and they did not have any documentation (user manuals) in the box. it says that it is included but there was nothing included with them. I bought these for my grandchildren for Christmas and it would be nice if San disk would include the information as to how to use the product. If you could tell me how i could get it that would be great.
4,Great for the price,"I had previously owned a 4GB IPOD Nano, this device has a MUCH better battery life than the NANO and was less money that the 8GB Nano that I would have otherwise purchased. The menu navigation was just as good once you get used to it. The only downside is that it is significantly slower in powering on and loading, up to a minute to get to my music after installing an SD card in it. That said once running I have no problems with response time."
4,"great player, software sucks","player is good the software supplied for media sucks... there are many forums which discuss the problem with their media converter not recognizing the player is plugged into the computer -- there is no solution, Sansa's technicians don't have a clue either. It works fine with Mediaplayer and Windows explorer for drag and dropping of files. Some people though are lucky they get the Media Converter to run fine... Sansa really needs to address this issue I know of a few people who have returned the player just because of this software glitch when there is nothing wrong with the player itself!"
3,Just OK,"Had this for about a week, then it crapped out and would not hook up with PC after. Tech-help had no clue, ""Just RMA"" they said. When skipping songs, there is a real pause that is aggrevating. Scroll wheel is cheap as stated before. Screen is real nice and video option is nice. All in all, I returned this for an Ipod Nano 8gb. No comparision. Outside of video (which I have no use for) and price, (you do get what you pay for) this player can't even stand in the Nano's shadow. Get the nano, you'll be glad after you did."
4,Excellent mp3 player,"This player is much better than Ipot. However, if Sandisk would load the player with more songs than just 20, that would be excellent."
1,Good if it lasts,"Bought one for my daughter as a present. It stopped working in 6 months. The sound of this was preferable to the IPOD ( much better than the IPOD when it was working). But she has gone back to the IPOD since it is more reliable and has not broken down yet, after 2 year."
1,"Mine works, wife's doesn't","Bought 2 of these for my wife & I as a pre-Christmas gift. Mine works fine in all regards, except when it comes to syncing w/ the Media Converter. It doesn't pick up either of our devices, and I haven't been able to convert any pics to them either.My wife's MP3 part actually stopped working. When you try to play something, the device freezes up. Everything else works fine (except getting the converter to work). I don't know what the deal is considering all the great reviews it's gotten. I do love the FM radio!"
1,Not working,"I bought this player 2 months ago and I am having a lot with problems with it: some times it screw up with all my songs, sometimes it freezes and some other problems. Searching in the internet I found out that I am not the only one having problems."
2,sandisk e280,several problems with this product. problems with charging the battery. the player locks and i have to wait until the battery is completely depleted to re-charge. the viewer remains on with nothing but a white light. problem with the sound. i have used several different earphones and the problem presists. i have had to reformat the player and reload all files. very disappointed in the product.
2,Cheap Scroll Wheel,"I been waiting to get my hands on the e280 since it was announced. I finally got mine today and have been less then impressed. For one, even though the unit feels solid, the buttons and especially the scroll wheel feel very cheap. The scroll wheel isn't smooth and locks up at times, not too bad but enough to be annoying. Every time you add or removed media, the sansa reboots and does an ""inventory"". I had about 4 GB of songs and it takes well over a minute to boot up, I'm sure it'll take much longer with 6 or 8 GB. Don't be me wrong, for the price it does have some nice features that the nano doesn't like FM tuner and video, but I ended up returning mine and will probably look at the nano or creative mp3 players. If sandisk would make a smoother scroll wheel and easier to manage media, this would be a nano-killer, but as it stands - not yet."
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE - Don't Buy It,"I ordered this as an alternative to buying an ipod. Not only is it slow when trying to flip through the song library, but it also feels cheap and fragile. Now comes the biggest part - after a *week* of using it I tried to turn it on. The screen lit up and showed the ""sandisk"" logo and then slowly faded to black and froze there! After this the player wouldn't even turn off or do anything at all! Customer service DIDNT HELP at all and this product is just a waste of time and money!! DONT BUY IT!!! I've also had a couple of friends who have had the same experience as me (I found this out after I had purchased it)."
5,"Better than a*****'s product, not as much periferals","This is the one I own, use it at work with fitted earplugs in an industrial setting, puts a smile on my face, can usually go three days without charging. Superb sound!!! Not much for periferals yet, that's the only drawback. I would love to buy amplified docks but not much out there (altec lansing and macally) If I lost this unit I would go buy one the next day. Enjoy"
3,great but not the R version,"You want a high capacity player great? You are looking at it and a fine one it is. Owning one of these could be the best alternative to an Ipod which I also own. The only drawback to this particular model is that it is not the e280R. That R stands for Rhapsody. The R version allows you to work with Rhapsody softwares ""channels"" and other Rhapsody features which are well worth the little extra cost if your a music nut and got a subscription to the service. If you do not require the Rhapsody service take this player for a spin you won't be disappointed."
4,Good product. Customer service is not helpul!,"The product came shipped with instructions for a earlier model, the e200. By comparing the e 200's insructions with my e280, they clearly don't have the same interface. The e280 was supposed to come with a driver as well(according to the packaging and product description) but did not. The device is not self-explanatory for this first time mp3 player's owner. I contacted customer service twice with my issues and both times they directed me to their website for said instructions and driver. Neither were available for this particular model however. In fact the website's link for the e280's instructions took me to the instructions for the e200, the same set of instructions included in the packaging. It was only after consulting several forums (unrelated to Sandisk) that I received the help I needed to get my player running properly. Nice product but lousy customer service. Thanks forums."
4,How to play .wav files on this unit,"Many will buy into the Sansa E series because of the FM recording feature, which works very well, if the recording is less than 2 hours. Sansa stores these FM (and also voice) recordings in uncompressed .wav format.Some listeners, like me, despise compression because they can hear the difference and believe that compressed audio further dumbs down an already compromised audience who have lost touch with the sound of live music. Sermon over.Anyhoo, you CAN play uncompressed .wav music files, but not if you put the music files into the MUSIC folder. The MUSIC folder only supports the compressed audio codecs MP3 and WMA.You have to drag-and-drop into the RECORD/FM or RECORD/VOICE folder. Sounds pretty dumb, eh? Sansa could have enabled WAV in the MUSIC folder, but in their finite wisdom, refuse to do so.It's a swell unit, and if you want to hear all the music that was actually recorded, use this workaround and you'll be happy."
4,sansa e280,Works well. Being more familiar with zen vision m&w and 8gig zen I had a slight learning curve to over come. The video converter makes everything I've tried so far play fine. The zen players won't play everything they convert. I also like the user replaceable battery and the AA battery extender. I would like it slightly better if videos were viewable from the micro disk. Overall a good product with good battery life and and audio-video play back.
4,Good value for the money,"Not as pretty or as easy to use as the Apple things. It also doesn't cost as much, you can replace your own battery and use it with whatever software you want."
3,"Great when it works, annoying otherwise","This MP3 player has a lot of things going for it. Good battery life, decent sound quality, awesome size, durable.My only real problem with it is how glitchy it has become. The player often crashes when it is hooked up to the computer, a problem that does not go away after being reformatted. Many of the features aren't very intuitive so expect to spend a bit of time tracking down information concerning problems on the web."
5,Sansa e280 MP3 player,"Love this product. Can record seminars, meetings that are broadcast on FM, sound quality is excellent. Downloads from the computer are easy.Very easy to use, very durable.Recommend purchasing Belkin chargers for wall plug, because charging the MP3 on the computer is very slow.The earplugs are kind of useless, Recommend purchasing good headphones, as you will enjoy the MP3 player much more."
4,SanDisk e280 MP3,"I like the MP3 player but I was disappointed when I couldn't load music from my Son's Mac on to it. Also, I can't seem to hear it over the lawn mower so that disappointed me too. I like that the battery lasts a long time and I like the fact that I can use it for pics too. I'm still learning and trying to get comfortable with the mechanics of it. I've noticed that most accessories out there are for Ipod's not MP3 players which made me wonder if I should have went with an Ipod which my Son constantly says (he has an Ipod)."
4,"Compact, durable, and extremely user friendly...a nice buy...","I had bought two Creative Zens 30GB before this and they both were dead on arrival...I tried this and it was perfect...smaller and so more portable (fits in my shirt pocket easily) and perfect for travel...i use this mostly in my car so the charger/FM transmitter (iTrip) is a must buy...With it's small size the screen is way too small for serious video watching but adequate for short plane trips and travel around 2-3 hours. Battery life is excellent,,,Of course, 8 Gb ain't much, but still enough for my whole music collection (about 6000 songs) and about 7 vids ranging from 5-40 minutes long. Still I will be looking forward to one with about 15Gb or more.Highly recommended..."
3,"good mp3 player, fast transfer, and design flaws","plays mp3's very well, battery life is good, however i do have numerous complaints,1) the buttons around the rotating circle are hard to press, and very user unfriendly.2) although the player looks cool, its designed using marterials that make it very easy to slip form ones hand.3) if you play files in a random order, the sond that you get if you click on the previous song button is not actually the previous song, i.e. the player forgets which song you just played, hence the button is useless.4) the earphones are a little big for small ears and the sound quality is average.5) does not play video;s in their native format, you need to convert them into a scandisk specified format using a software converter that is easily available."
3,"Works great, but a little difficult to learn to operate.","Like most electronics a 10 year old can just pick it up and make whatever it is work. Well, I'm 52 and I had a very hard time learning how this player works. First off the download offered by San Disk doesn't work with this player e280 ver. 2. After a call to tech support and a promise to send me the new link I'm still awaiting the link... 2 weeks later.Works well with Media Player 11, and I'm just stumbling around with the manual that you must download. Sounds pretty good with new earbuds from my old player and I like the form and fit in my pocket. A must have is a rubber/silicone case just to hold on to it. The aluminum case is great and solid but slippery as all get-out.Overall, it is worth the money but San Disk support is very poor."
4,Great mp3 player at a low price.,"I bought the SanDisk Sansa as a Christmas gift for my 17 year old son. He is really enjoying it. He says that the size is ideal and the sound quality is excellent. 8GB seems to be enough for his music collection. He formerly had a Creative Jukebox which no longer works. Compared to the Sansa, the Creative was much larger and the display was difficult to read. It also cost about twice as much as the SanDisk."
4,Work's for me!,"I realy like this unit. The controls are easy to use. The recorder has a nice microphone that picks up sounds quite well. Storage capacity is great even without using the optional card. The FM radio is a bit of a disapointment, it has to be a very strong signal for the unit to find it. I never used the radio on my last player, so to me it is no big deal. I'd definately by another one."
4,better than I expected,"This is my first mp3 player and I now regret having waited so long to buy one. The 8G of memory sold this player to me as I have way more mp3 files than it can hold, but did not want a hard drive type player. My only problems with the unit are that I don't like the headphones, and windows media player does not always want to auto sync right with it once the memory is full, unless I manually delete files first. I bought koss portapro headphones for it and the sound quality I now get amazes me compared to the old walkman type players I have had. I didn't buy the ipod simply because of it's much higher price and now I am glad I saved the money. I would have given a 5 star rating if I considered the headphones even usable."
1,VERRRRYYYY Upsetting!,"At first i was extremely happy with this product, but now it SUCKS! The damn thing freezes. Thats never good. I am completey unsatisfied!"
2,Sloooooooooooooooooooooow...,"I really want to enjoy this player... its a beauty to look at and is the perfect size. But...Takes about 30 seconds to boot up, takes another 10 seconds to get anything to play, takes about 10 seconds to skip to a new song, takes about 30 seconds to transfer 1 song... i've never had a player that was anything but instantanious (except for the initial boot)."
2,Doesn't Work with Any Known Music Subscription Service,"I've owned my e280 for about a week now and have come to the realization that the e280 is not compatible with any known music subscription service. Even though the likes of Napster, Rhapsody and Yahoo Music declare that any of the e200 series players work with their services, it does not. This defeats the very reason why I picked the e280, to hold a lot of subscription music for my trips to the gym.The player seems to work okay for your own MP3 music, but don't even consider this lemon for holding anything more than that."
1,Very poor software,"This product works only with Microsoft Media Player which is a very poor software, nothing for the real music fan.I have tested the sansa e280 in my office when it came and it worked despite all the problems with windows media player. But then I wanted to connect to my computer at home and it was blocked absolutely. I tried everything (uninstall and install again), but without success. Today I went to a computer expert of our lab, but after some trials he gave up. So the Sansa e280 seems to be rather useless because of its close connections to Microsoft.The update of the firmware solved this problem, but the software for upload is still very poor: let the Chinese do it ! Used the Media Monkey which is much better than the Microsoft Mediaplayer, but still not logical enough.The memory size is too small for a music freak, 32 Gb would be more appropriate."
1,DO NOT BUY-SCREEN WILL BREAK!!,"I had the e 280 for 5 weeks. I made the mistake of putting it in a backpack (in its case). The inner screen broke, the warranty does not cover physical damage and San Disk won't repair it! I spent two hundred dollars for a paperweight. I am a grown woman who does not abuse things. DO NOT BUY THIS-you will be sorry. All the features in the world do not make up for an item that is so fragile!"
1,Sansa e280,"Not a bad mp3 player until it breaks. Mine stopped working after 9 months, in fact went completely dead. amazon are not prepared to honor any warranty. Buy something else."
2,Think twice on this one...,"You've probably noticed how many refurb units of this product are to be found everywhere. There's a message there. I bought this unit and found it delightful, easy to use (better interface than c200 series) but it only lasted three months of light usage. One or the other channel would fade out all the time. Sansa customer service strung me out for three weeks asking for successive things (invoice, packing slip, all package contents including old blister pack) and finally denied my warranty return for who knows what! Once you've bought this product, it's yours! Good luck."
3,Okay,"I had no owners manual with it. I did find one online. Also, I had the 2GB player before and took the music off it and put it on this one. Now it won't stay on for more than 4 minutes at a time unless the screen is on all the time. Very annoying. I've gotten no help for this problem no matter who I've contacted. Again, annoying at best. Not sure I'd recommend it to anyone. However the 2GB was a real trooper, so I hope I just happened to get a dud."
1,Buy the ipod,I bought this product in early December 2007. It did not work and I was sent a replacement. After downloading 5 CDs it froze up and quit working. I'm returning both items and getting an ipod.
1,cool......................................untill it doesnt play your songs,i always wanted one of these players just ts be different than people with an ipod. i opened this gift on christmas morning and ran to plug it in to my computer. i transferred all of my music to it and listened to until a little pink message came up. it read to continue music subscription sync to divice.so i syncronized it to the player again but the message came up again. this is a big problem according to customer support so i took it back to the store
3,Defective -- trying again.,"Good player... easy to use. Buttons are a bit difficult till you get used to them. I especially like the flywheel volume control. Sounds very good, as good or better than my 6G Zen Micro did before it died. Much easier to carry and generally deal with than the Zen. Had to send back for a replacement after one channel suddenly went bad after about two weeks. I'm sure it was a physical defect in the jack (for awhile before the channel completely died I could jiggle it and get it working again), so hopefully the replacement will work well. Up till that point I was really enjoying it."
2,Okay until the headphone jack stopped working properly...,"I bought this player a little over a year ago and enjoyed it for the most part. I agree with the other reviewers saying it's slow to boot up, load playlists, navigate around, and the interface could use some work, but overall it wasn't that bad. Then last week all of a sudden, the headphone jack wasn't working properly. When I pushed the headphone plug in halfway, the left plays but not the right, and when I pushed the headphone plug in all the way, the right plays but not the left. So, I guess depending on whichever ear is your favorite, you plug in the cord accordingly. How annoying.It's really irritating because I bought a Sansa thinking that it would for sure outlast an iPod, and it didn't. 'Tis a sad day..."
2,Con-Fuzed and Ticked Off,"I pre-ordered the 8GB Sansa Fuze and didn't receive any promotional microSD. But that's the least of my concerns. I find the product -- which doesn't ship with any media converter software -- is throwing all types of general fault errors when trying to remove tracks. What's worse is I can't even register the player on Sansa's web site, making support an issue. Perhaps Sansa should build support around a new product before releasing it. I am disgusted with Sansa beyond this review! Oh, did I mention that it takes what feels like forever to upload and refresh the unit?"
4,Excellent value for $$,"I bought this item a month ago and I am very happy with this product for the following reasonsa) Cheaper compared to Ipod nanob) Very Good sound qualityc) Easy interface to drag and drop your music files just like a regular USB drive, no need for additional software on your computer. If you want to transfer photos and video, ofcourse the software is includedd) Very Good microphone for voice recording, have used it multiple times since I bouth this iteme) Looks goodg) Very nice battery life ~14 hoursWill recommned to everybody, I bought it for $149, now it's selling at $129, even better"
4,SanDisk MP3 Player Usablilty,"This device is user friendly and has all of the features one could ever want from an MP3 player. Good price. Excellent sound and video quality. Battery life is sufficient.Improvements I would suggest are: smoother scrolling wheel (iPod is easier to use), better supporting software (support for POD casts and sources for video), accessory selection and availability is sparse."
1,Don't buy,"I bought two of the Sansa e280 players for Christmas 2007. My player is working fine for now but my son's player has gone into ""white screen"" mode and I have not been able to find a solution on the SanDisk site or on the Internet. When I contacted Amazon customer service by email they refused to accept the defective unit back because it is beyond ""the 30 day"" limit. A call to the Amazon service rep was a bit more helpful. The rep was very pleasant and connected me via conference call to a SanDisk technician. The technician could not solve the problem of the ""white screen"" either. He told me to email my Amazon invoice to SanDisk Support. I am still waiting for a reply. Hopefully, this story will have a happy ending. In the meantime, my recommendation would be to find another player until SanDisk can fix this problem and the problems related by other owners."
3,Uncertain,"While I'm sure this is a decent product if you buy it new and from a reliable source. My experience with it was not the greatest. In fact...new or not, don't buy this if you have Vista. Do what I did, buy the updated one, the Fuze. It works so much better. Overall a decent product I guess. But the Fuze works better. ""Let the buyer beware"""
4,Full Service MP3 Player,"I have been throughly impressed with the functionality of the SanDisk Sansa e280. For the price, it does everything that an MP3 player should do and then some. A very nice feature is the FM tuner. Great for those evening commutes on the subway/bus."
4,good mp3 player,"Its a nice little player. It appears to be constructed very well and it is inexpensive. If your not caught up on the idea of having an apple icon on everything you own, this should be definite consideration. I use my mp3 player with Rhapsody and it works great."
2,Not what I had in mind,The SanDisk Sansa may be fine for some people but I was disappointed in three things: 1) The FM radio reception was so poor that it would not even pick up stations that come in loud and clear on my car radio. It would pick up a few local stations that I had no interest in. 2) The transfer of MP3 files to the device was unnecessary complicated. I succeeded (evidently) in transferring 2 GB of MP3 files to the device but none of them showed up on the Sansa screen nor in Windows Explorer. The various preloaded folders are a real annoyance and cannot be deleted. Why not just allow one to drag and drop MP3 files the way one does with a flash drive? 3) JPEG images have to go through some sort of processing that vastly reduces their resolution. It's clear that the concept of MP3 players of this type needs a lot of work.
2,Does not support non-latic characters,I returned it because it does not support non-Latin characters.Another negative point - little bumps on the wheel that are supposed to increase traction are way too sharp and unpleasant to touch.
1,UMS mode not so UMS,"Note there are 2 versions of this player. You can find out by looking at the back of you player. I originally purchased this player because i like organizing my music with the my own directory structure and not use ID tags. This player does not support folder structure. you will need to use their software. with version 2, there is a special process just to transfer files using ums mode. also this product looks cool, it does not perform the way i had thought it would. If you like not having to use any propietery software and would like to use your own file organizational structure, the similarly priced Cowon D2 is the way to go."
1,Problem with Amazon,"I ordered this last week and I was supposed to get it on Monday, which I didn't, so I tracked my package. I am in St. Paul, MN, and Amazon put the wrong label on it and delivered it to someone in Coffeyville, KS. I called customer service and the man I talked to didn't apologize once for the HUGE mistake and just laughed a lot when I told him that they delivered a relatively expensive item to someone who didn't pay for it. They're sending me a replacement, but I'm still really pissed off."
1,looked good on paper....but,"After less than 30 days of use, the screen has blackened, rendering the beautiful color display screen useless and the unit no better than the iPod shuffle.There has been no trauma to the device, no evidence of dropping, abuse or mishandling - just a black screen, especially dark at the area immediately above the SD card slot.Although, when it was fully functional, the sound quality was better than the iPod, display was brighter and the colors more vivid - however - I can't afford to replace the player every thirty days or so.My advice - avoid SanDisk, drop the extra cash for the (this hurts to say) iPod - pick any model - it will certainly be better that this piece of junk."
2,Terrible Product - Video in your pocket - NOT,"This is a terrible product if you purchase it to view viedoes. The media converter that is sold with it is not up to date and a new one must be downloaded. After three calls to customer service, they still have no answer as to where a movie or TV show which is compatible with their product can be purchased."
3,Windows explorer for transferring mp3 to player?,can you use Windows explorer to drag and drop mp3 or wma into the player or is it limited to using Windows Media Player for transferring files?also can you use music that Ive converted to mp3 or wma from my own cd collection?
1,Dont buy it!!! It works fine for a short while than it breaks,"When I got the Sensa I was happy with it - sound quality was good, it was a small nice device. The problems started when I tried to upgrade my headsets to the Bose In-Ear headset. For some reason the Sensa is not compatible with those. After going back and forth for a while with SanDisk they eventually admitted that their MP3 player hardware has some problems working with Bose.But the problems did not stop there... Two weeks ago my Sensa just froze, no key would work and it would refuse to turn off. I had to wait a few hours for the battery to die before I could use it again.And the last problem - now my Sensa would not turn on!!! it just died while playing some music - I am on the phone with SanDisk support now, from my past experience I do not expect much help there....My only wish now would be to be able to return this junk and get my money back..."
1,Bad Product line,"I bought the Sansa e200. It was on sale for about $84. I also bought a power supply for use while traveling. It was a total waste of money. My e200 has menu screens that are neither English or Spanish. The manual/instructions were supposed to be available on Adobe PDF. I have the latest Adobe (8.0), but I cannot bring up the instructions. All attempts to solve this problem have failed. I would never waste my money on another Sansa product.Puffmaru"
1,"Constantly Freezes up. Refreshes Data Base on its own, takes ten minutes. I hate it.","This player is terrible. The buttons to play, stop, and skip are WAY to small, and the volume ring is raised, which is right next to the buttons making it even more difficult to control. In one month, it has frozen several times, and I had 1700 songs, and I turned it on one day and 1000 of my songs were gone. I called the 1-800 number, and they had no solutuions. I took it back to the store, exchanged it for another sandisk same model, and it is even a bigger disaster. I went to run two days ago, turned it on and it said ""refreshing Data Base"" which took 10 minutes, and I could not use it while running. As I write this SCATHING review; I look at My Sandisk Sansa, the screen Frozen, and I cannot even turn it off. This player is a nightmire, I would stay far away from this player, and only recomend it to enemies."
4,Best for the money,"After a lot of looking and shopping around, it was the best for the money at the time (Christmas 2006) through Amazon.Pros1)Has a great battery life2)Lots of memory built in and able to use a memory card for more.3)Small Size and still able to have pictures and videos.4) Firmware update easy5) Radio with recordCons1) Not much control(Add/Delete/Move/rename etc..)if not connected to computer through USB2) Not so user friendly. Having not much experience making playlists, it took a lot to try and organize some of my files also setting up slideshows was hard for me to figure out.Overall, Very Happy with it after learning curve and getting it configured."
4,MP3 Sandisk 8 GB,Only a 4 star because when you move or hit a bump the head set moves and sound only plays in one ear. You need to move it around again until both sides play. Good sound normally. I don't like that you have to buy the charger separately. It should come with it. It will play for what seems like days on a full charge.
4,Great MP3 player at an affordable price,"This MP3 player is very good... once you get to learn to use it. You have to work a bit on you Windows Media Player to have your playing list right. Fidelity is awesome... I have heard things in my music that I have never done before. There are also a lot of accesories, but I have not found any DVD player that fits the sansa in a similar way like the Ipod."
4,Sansa E280,"I have been thoroughly satisfied with the Sansa E280 MP3 Player and recommend it for anyone who is looking for a flash memory player. I have about 465 songs on it now and have used 2.2GB of memory. There is plenty of space left for more music or videos. The FM receiver is excellent and a welcome addition. The user interface is easy to use and downloading music has been a breeze (I use Rhapsody). The relatively short play time is not a problem as I just include the E280 into my daily charging routine along with my smart phone, etc. I have not used the earbuds that came with it very much as I have my own headphones so I can't really comment on them. The shuffle may occasionally replay a song now and then but not as often as other music shufflers I have used. In all, this is a well-deigner unit that does everything I want it to and more."
2,"Good sound, bad software","This little MP3 player offers good sound, but after a year or two, the software gets corrupted and it becomes difficult to navigate the menus. I'd recommend finding a different, more recent player. Despite the price and storage capacity, avoid this unit. Even if it offers superior sound, what good is it if you can't access your music/content?"
5,Excellent iPod Alternative,"Works beautifully and plays MP3, WMA, and WMA with media rights. Also includes a converter to convert most popular video formats to play on this one. Includes FM Radio, Voice Recorder. The controls are also very intuitive and friendly. Almost as friendly as the iPod at a much lower price."
4,Good player but the firmware was buggy,"The player came with old firmware and buggy media converter. It didn't have the option for selecting the USB mode and the media converter couldn't detect the player. So there was no way of copying video to the player.I had to spend more than 2 hours researching on the internet to find ways to upgrade the firmware (the sansa firmware updater didn't work either). The earphones are pathetic, you are better-of getting a new one.Other than these issues, its a good player, good value for money. Audio/video quality is very good."
5,SanDisk MP3 player,"I love this product. Bought this 8 GB model to replace the 4 GB model (which I gave to my daughter). It's small, stylish and works wonderfully. Unlike the IPOD, the user can replace the battery, when required. Also has FM and recorder function. For my money buy this instead of the more expensive IPOD. Battery life is also very good.Buy it!....you will Like it!!"
5,Nice,"This is a nice MP3. I got it on Black Friday on Amazon for only $99.99 , yes Sansa View 8 GB MP3 280. While everyone else was looking at the lighting rounds on Black Friday they didn't see the tiny small icons around the today's deal page. I use Sony's SonicStage myself. Records at 192 for crisp sound."
4,"Excellent value, wish it worked with iTunes","I bought the 8GB Sansa e280 for less than a 4GB iPod Nano. It has a great screen, lots of cool functions like voice recording and FM radio, and I like the navigation wheel MUCH better than the tempermental iPod wheel.I do NOT like the ease of adding tunes and movies on the Sansa. The Rhapsody makes it a little easier, but it can't compare with the ease of iTunes.And SanDisk's anti-iPod campaign is a loser. It reminds me of the VHS-Betamax battle of yesteryear. If Sansas worked with iTunes, SanDisk would take a much bigger share of the market, since they are clearly superior machines in functionality, design, and value."
3,OK,"The player is easy to use and a good value, however the earphone jack no longer works after a couple of weeks."
1,Poor quality. I have 2 and they both malfunction.,"Poor quality. I have 2 and they both malfunction.Nice while it lasts,,,,"
1,Pretty much everything is wrong,"- Received wrong manual with it- No software included- None of my songs will play, and none of my songs have any DRM -- I've tried multiple formats- Songs transfer, but will not show up on the e280 -- they are taking up space, but are not visible to be played- Cannot drag and drop; MTP is not working at all- Rough on edges -- the craftsmanship is poor, rough enough that it's uncomfortable to holdI will be returning this immediately."
4,:),"the mp3 player works just fine, it came in a box and everything, the same if I would've bought it at Best Buy or somewhere else. It works just fine, I'm very happy with it. Shipping was faster than expected. Amazon.com is awesome.thanks."
4,good for this prive,"hello all,i used sansa before and that was a refurbished item.this is not a refurbished but i have a feeling that this is not a perfect product. first i bought 8gb. the wheel was not really smooth andthe tip of the headphones was really hard to plug into the the player.so i wanted a replacement. eventually they admitted that they have only 4gband i accepted it.but again the wheel is not smooth and tip of headphones is frustrating.BUT for this price, this item is still great.and i love this item because it works with LINUX as a memory stick.thanks"
4,Sansa MP3 review,"This was a reconditioned MP3 player, and I would rate the purchase 5 stars except the shuffle option often plays the same group of songs again and again. Otherwise, it was a winner of a purchase."
5,Sansa e280 8g,Great product. We now have 3 in the family. Best advantage over Apple is FM radio access and ability to increase memory with micro flash drive.
3,SANDISK LACKS CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I BOUGHT TNHIS PLAYER FROM ONE OF AMAZONS'S DROP SHIPPER, (NOT THEIR FAULT) AND AFTER I RECEIVED IT, THE MICRO CARD SLOT WOULD NOT ACCEPT A MICRO CARD.....KEEPS FALLING OUT. I CALLED THE COMPANY THAT SHIPPED IT (TheFactoryDepot) and they tell me that they have no replacement, that a new model in out. So I called SANDISK, AND THEY TELL ME TO RETURN IT TO AMAZON, AMAZON SAYS IT WAS SHIPPED BY (TheFactoryDepot) .....I'M BACH TO WHERE I STARTED WITH TheFactoryDepot.i CALLED SANSISK AGAIN AND DEMANDED THAT IT BE REPLACED.....THIS TIME AFTER A FEW E-MAILS, THE GAVE ME AN RMA # AND PREPAID POSTAGE TO SHIP IT BACK.....THAT WAS ALMOST A MONTH AGO. cALLED SANDISK AGAIN AND THEY NOW TELL ME THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS PLAYER STILL LISTED ON AMAZON EITHER, THEY WILL GET BACK WITH ME WHEN THEY FIND ONE.WELL IT'S ALMOST OCTOBER AND THEY HAVE NOT GOT BACK TO ME YET......NOT MORE SANDISK PRODUCTS FOR ME"
4,Great for the money,"This is my second Sansa. The 1st one died because I kept it in a rubberized sleeve which instead of protecting the unit allowed mositure to collect and rust the unit.This Sansa charges quickly, holds the charge for a long time and has a good form factor. My only complaint is that once an album is done playing the music stops, it doesn't continue to the next album; something my Lyra did automatically."
4,Love it!,"Some of the funtionality seems awkward. Althought this is my first MP3 player. I really love that when you pause and it shuts off automatically, that when you restart it comes up paused right where you left it. I wish I could listen to my files, at the same time I have it plugged in to my laptop for charging."
3,slightly glitchy and doesn't hold 8GB worth,"The mp3 player doesn't hold 8gb worth and sometimes freezes. I've actually had to take the batteries out a couple of times. But that's one of the reasons I chose this model. My last mp3 player's battery needed to be replaced after about a year of only sporadic use, so I picked this one since you can change it yourself. Just two little screws and it's as easy as your cell. Overall I think it was still a pretty good deal."
5,does not take 5 mins to boot,"The report of this device taking 5 minutes to boot up is incorrect. I have mine nearly full and it takes only a few seconds for it to boot up.Overall, I am thrilled by this MP3 player. Its easy to use, small, and has a good radio receiver. Be prepared to make Ipod users jealous, especially when you tell them the price.The only disadvantage is that you must have the Real Player installed on your computer to transfer files back and forth. On the other hand, once connected, the device shows up as a device in the file manager and you can drag and drop files back and forth. You don't actually need to use the Real Player to transfer your MP3 files to the device."
4,SanDisk e280 nice little player,This MP3 does everything they say it will do. I only listen to music (no videos/movies) so the 8 GB is more than enough for me. It does have the mini-SD expansion slot if you need additional space. I immediately bought a new headphone set as the one it comes with was very uncomfortable for me to wear. I keep my player in the little black sleeve most of the time since the face can be scratched very easily. The battery life is very good. I listened to it in the car on an 8 hour road trip and only used about 1/4 of the battery. No negatives to report for this player.
5,After fighting the idea of an MP3 player for years...,SanDisk SDMX4-8192 Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player (Black)I bought one for my wife to use on her 2 week stint in the hospital. I researched it and came up with the Sansa Rhapsody 8GB. I have 1200 CD cuts and pics of the family and room to spare. Battery is a strong point - both run time and life. And I can replace it. Let me be clear - I CAN REPLACE THE BATTERY. I love it so much I bought one for myself AND have since bought a 3rd one. I love this darn thing. Where have I been?Only downside I have noticed - it seems to have a bit of a steep learning curve. But don't be afraid to experiment. Play with it a bit before you go off on your trip expecting it to block out the noise on your flight. Trust me... it will be worth it. BOOT TIME is no where near 5 minutes. Sound is great. Updates are easy. Did I say I love this darn thing?
2,first it was ok,"its a nice mp3 player, but the description fails to mention that it has to ""refresh"" data each time you unplug it. and even though it can hold 2000 songs i could never get above 500. now it doesnt want to have ANY songs playing on it."
2,It stopped working,This was the greatest alternative to an ipod I loved everything about it but after about a year it completely fried! maybe i just got a defective one. ? Im not gona buy another R.I.P. sansa e280
2,Great unless it breaks..no parts available!,"This unit is great, very easy to use...But don't be unfortunate enough to crack the screen...Sansa doesn't care...there are no places to get it fixed...they don't sell parts...We have one that is less than a week old and the screen(with the flimsy screen protector ON) cracked as it came into contact with my son's cell phone!Sansa says tough luck. I'll not be buying or recommending these to anyone again...AND I BOUGHT 4 of THEM!! NICE!Thanks for nothing Sansa!"
2,Good MP3: defective earphones,"The MP3 was fine. The earphones were defective. One side didn't work. Two calls to SanDisk were fruitless. They said the earphones were an accessory and not covered under warranty. But if they could find some they would send them. That was 7 weeks ago and no response despite another call getting the same response. The earphones came with the player, had Sansa name on them and are needed to use the player. So I bought another set of earphones. Pretty disappointed with a company with such a good reputation for quality products."
3,Not as smooth as I thought,"I have had a number of problems downloading my music from my laptop. I have a number of CDs on my computer that SanDisk failed to recognized. Even some I have downloaded a number of times, but it failed to show up in a way that I can listen to it."
1,Works great for a day.,"I had to return the first Sansa I had because it malfunctioned. I just received the second a few days ago, and now the replacement isn't working either.When the replacement was working, I really enjoyed a lot of the features. However, I have sworn off getting a third replacement. Two that didn't work are more than enough for me."
3,a good alternative to the nano,"I should say up front that I got the 8GB Sansa for half price at Best Buy due to a typo on their website - otherwise I would have seriously considered a Nano. ($169 CDN instead of $269 in the store)I like the idea of having a radio, voice recorder and picture/video capabilities - and the fact I can replace the battery myself puts this device light years ahead of the nano (hello Apple, radio's only been around for oh... 100 years).On the negative side the wheel is terrible, it actually gets stuck while you rotate it and it is raised up so high it blocks the smaller buttons surrounding the wheel.Fortunately someone wrote a neat script that works with iTunes so you can sync your Sansa with an iTunes playlist - very cool.If Sandisk fixes the scroll wheel they'll have a real winner on their hands"
4,good mp3 player,"A good full-featured player. Decent sound quality. Easy to navigate.Our family owns 3 Sansa players (1, 2 and 8Gb)"
1,Very Dissapointed!,"I'm returning mine today ... I wanted something that was intuative and easy to use. I don't like Ipod because I prefer to drag and drop my own music to my player. My E280 cannot connect to my computer because it can't find drivers. Extensive research on the Sandisk web site resulted in no drivers for any of their new products! So, ease of use is out the window on this product ... very very dissapointed in SanDisk. Looks I am being forced to buy an Ipod."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I was excited to order this ,nice unit...but very limted compatibility with what's out there...i should have gotten an IPOD."
2,I dislike the Sansa e280,"The graphics and equalizer function on this unit is very good. However, the system is not user friendly. The installation CD would not run. The player cannot be recognized by my system. The connections are not compatible to most other devices; i.e., camera, and cannot download pictures other than those already downloaded to your computer. There is no AC adapter; the buttons surrounding the SanDisk Sansa e280's scrollwheel is difficult to press; photos and video must go through conversion with bundled software; the expansion slot can be used with music only, not photos or other media or data; and recordings are made only in WAV. For an advanced type of player (as advertised ""advanced MP3"") previus models have more to offer. I am disappointed in this purchase."
2,JUST CHUCK IT UP AS ANOTHER MP3 JUNK!,"I purchased this Sansa MP3 player on May 14 2007 and unlike the Creative and Philips that I had and returned them. I had not hav any problems with this SanDisk for 6 months then it stared to freeze and went to hell after a year, This e280 had great sound. Just chuck it up as another MP3 junk by SanDisc!"
4,Musicbox,I love the product. It is simple to download songs or pictures and it's my first MP3. Sound is very good. The earbuds are fine but easy to break. The only complaint is that this 8mg is not going to store anything like 2000 songs. 464 songs loaded and less than 2mg is left. The controls are ok and the look is great. The screen is good for the small size. I bought another one for my daughter because I have not seen anything better. I don't expect to use the video and have not tried it.
1,Avoid this MP3 Player,I purchased this MP3 player because I wanted to avoid the IPOD cool aid. I downloaded paid for music from Napster To Go and that was the only time I have been able to listen to music on this device. I investigated and installed the firmware updater to ensure I had the most current firmware; this did not correct the situation the pink screen of death as returned and will not go away. I contacted SanDisk and they have ignored my email. I just order the IPOD this morning.
4,A gift that's worth it,"I bought the Sandisk Sansa e280 for my partner because his other mp3 player (not Sansa) couldn't be recognized by Window's Vista. The Sansa he just plugged and played. I uploaded his library that I had on my external hard drive so he didn't have to do much, just explore all the wonderful features. What he really likes is that there is a radio on this mp3. Furthermore, you can expand the memory on it by using the micro sd slot on the side (I got him a 2G to place videos and photos on the card). It's an excellent buy AND you don't have to use iTunes!"
4,Good MP3 Player Sansa E280,"The Sansa is a great MP3 player. Easy to use controls. It offers much more than music. FM radio, pictures, video's. Transfering music is a snap! Converting video's is a snap also. The player is built tough. The only problem I had is the SD card slot will not work with mine. Keeps popping out of the slot. I tried two different cards with the same results. But all in all 8 GB is plenty of storage. For the price you can't beat it. I even received more money off the original price because the price dropped with in the thirty day period. Thanks Amazon!"
4,"Nice design, great functions","I bought the Sansa e200 convinced it was better buy than a comparable iPod. It sure is. Both are similar regarding size and design, but the e200's extra functionality (FM radio and voice recorder) and lower price make it a better option. It's one black spot is having only one playlist (called Go List). Other than that, great product."
5,Great Player,I've had this player for a couple weeks now and I love it. You can use media player to organize your music or just drag and drop. I uploaded pictures and a movie onto it just to test and while you have to use their converting software it really was not a big deal. I recommend getting better earbuds. While these are not that bad I think the sound would be much better with higher quality ones. I also recommend getting the travel kit and use the plastic screen saver & leather holder. It cushions falls and protects the screen.
4,good travelling companion,"I have never had an MP3 player before, but I was planning a long bus trip and decided I needed something to keep me entertained. I found the SanDisk SDMX4 loaded with my music and pod cast an excellent way to pass the time. I chose this particular MP3 player for a number of reasons. The 8 Gig size, the FM tunner, the estimated 20 hour play time and a price well below Apple products. There are some things that I wish were better. I found the ear buds uncomfortable, I would have liked a ""scan for station"" feature on the tunner. Finally, I found it more difficult then necessary to load things on it from my computer. For example, I wanted to put a picture of my family on there to be able to show people, but I had to mess around with several program to get a picture that visible. Nevertheless I am not sorry that I got it."
4,Renate G,"This is my first MP3 player, which I selected after reading other reviews and I like it. It has a large capacity and holds most of my CD's and sounds great through my stereo."
1,New Product Has Limited Functionality,"There are two versions of the e280 - v1 and v2. v2 is NOT an upgrade but is in fact a downgrade and one that is not pointed out to the consumer. You are no longer permitted to switch your USB mode from MTP to MSC mode meaning your device no longer doubles as a USB drive! You are also locked into using Windows Media Player and DRM only mp3s. What an upgrade!Aside from the rant, the product is a phenomenal piece of technology. I only wish I wasn't deceived into buying a newer, lower version of a fantastic product."
5,Sansa 8 gig,"This player was easy to set up, easy to use, has the right accessories. It holds all my songs and has a long battery life.The Zune's software was not compatible with my version of Window's XP Media Center 2004. I bought that and could not use it.I realized that I was over complicating it and that 8G and a fixed flash drive was more than enough. Who is going to watch video on these things anyway?"
3,mtp vs. mrc,"This is a good enough sounding unit but the controls are a little hard to use(unless you have really small fingers) probably the price for being so small.I had problems with mtp mode / Rhapsody. After a rhapsody download, the rest of my music (loaded from cd) could no longer be located by the unit. the files were still there - you just couldn't see or play them. I switched to mrc mode and discontinued Rhapsody and now everthing seems to be working fine."
2,A big disappointment,"Don't waste your money on this one. Mine worked well for a few weeks but was not as user friendly as I had hoped. When mine began having problems syncing playlists, I contacted tech support. The TS was abysmal. I tried four times but got nowhere. The reps were obviosuly middle eastern with nearly impossible accents to understand. They could not move beyond their troubleshooting script and had no real working knowledge of the device. I don't like Apple products but finally bought an IPOD NANO. It is more user friendly, smaller, lighter and it works."
1,Fast Forwad doesn't work with audio books and lectures,A major disappointment. The device does not work at all with large files ( 1hr or longer). Fast Forward skips to next item or back to main menu really easily. The whole navigation experience is very frustrating because the unit loses current playing position every time you connect it for charging or to download a new song. Horrible for audio books and lecture podcasts.
4,Sandisk Sansa 8 gb,"This mp3 player is fine unless you need to record something. It doesn't record clearly. Other than that, the features and everything else is fine."
4,Excellent Quality,"The quality is excellent. The collection of music is abundant. The sound is wonderful. The recording feature is useful.Although I did not read the dirrection, I have not had any big problem in handling it. However,if the playlist is editable and the lyrics of the songs can be shown on the screen, this product could be my dream work. This is why I give it four stars. The one left is for the future."
3,"Sansa e280 some problems, but a good buy!","This is my second Sansa product. The only 2 complaints I have are:1). The bezel is loose.2). The only way to charge the player is through a USB port.Other than these issue the product is easy to use, performs very well, & holds a long charge (21 hours).MWR"
5,highly recommended!,this video remains true to the spirit of dr. seuss books. the original illustrations are animated and my 3 year old son just loves to repeat the rhymes. it teaches reading and spelling but is also highly entertaining. it's a good read along video if you have the books. highly recommended!
2,Médiocre...,Presque tout est dit dans le titre de mon commentaire (le mme que pour les autres volumes). J'avais acheté le DVD il y a environ 10 ans et non seulement les raccourcis sont grotesques par rapport à la BD mais les voix américaines sont pitoyables. Seule utilité: j'ai pu parfaire un peu mon anglais... pour un vocabulaire qui me sera sans doute peu utile...
3,"Pretty Good, But Not Great","I did like this book, but sometimes it was just a little too unrealistic. Towards the end of it, I flipped it over to see if it was a christian novel. The male character, Chris, was cool, but he wasnt the typical man to me. I know a lot of people were pleased with the fact that there was no cursing or sex scenes, but to me without them the book seemed like it was written by my pastor. Overall, it was a good book with a good plot, but it, without a doubt, could have been more spicy."
2,BORING!,"This book was boring and my opinion has nothing to do with the fact that it was ""clean."" I've read books by Francis Ray and Victoria Christopher Murray who are ""clean"" authors who have written strong, wonderful books that I enjoyed.Where was the dialogue? Why was it so wordy? I found myself bored by the end of the third chapter. There wasn't enough interaction between the characters and some of it was just unrealistic. I would not recommend."
3,Just Okay,"Living on the Edge is not a bad book but it's nothing special either. The plot, the characters the whole concept has been done before and done better. It's a pleasant beach book but you'll forget it in two weeks. Read anything by E. Lynn Harris or Terri McMillan instead."
5,Outstanding for teaching how advertising really works,"This is an outstanding book which simply and practically teaches the elements that make ads effective (and ineffective). You must purchase the answer key to go along with it in order to benefit from it (the answer key is under the same name and easily found with amazon.com's search engine). I have been in advertising for 20 years and this book is a must-have for anyone interested in creating effective print advertising. Also, anyone who teaches advertising would benefit greatly by using this book as a text because students love it."
4,"Good product. A little more worn then the title said, but overall great!","I ordered this book because I needed it for a class. It came very fast!! I was surprised! It came a little more torn up then the review said, but it's still the book I needed so I am still happy."
1,Rip-off.,"First beef: All the ads compared in the book were 1-page, 4-color ads. However, reproduced in the book they are sixth-page B/W.Next beef: It's a workbook for classroom discussion. The book never reveals which ad pulled best.Third beef: Not only does the book NOT reveal which ad pulled best, it doesn't reveal where/how/from whom to obtain an answer key.Fourth beef: Amazon review system doesn't allow zero stars, so I had to give it one."
1,This book stinks!,"Shame on me for not researching carefully enough to discover that it's just a textbook with NO answers; you have to have the instructor's guide. All by itself, it's nothing less than a ripoff. As a marketing & advertising professional, I'm disappointed."
1,worthless without the answer key. where is it?,This may be an exceptional book but without the answer key it is useless. I can't believe you would not publish the key with the book!
2,So which one did?,"Well this book could be helpful, it has a lot of research talk in it. The ads are black and white. It can be a bit confusing. I'd pass on it if you are a graphic designer, but if you are in market research and analysis it might work for you. I'd recommend it if you can buy it real [inexpensive]! Don't pay a lot for this book it's not worth it. But you may get some information from the ""professional"" comments. Over all it's a pass up. Don't buy it by the cover! It's not going to answer that question"
1,waste of money,"My Professor has the answer book where all the ads are rated and answers are given. Also, he got color transparencies. How come they don't include this in the package?! (I don't mean Amazon) The book is really bad! The illustrations are black and white which is terrible! The quality of the paper is cheap! I regret I bought this book."
3,Okay for the novice...,"It was a good book for the basic ad designer, but I have only been designing ads for a year and the stuff in the book seemed very academic. Any designer knows these basic design elements. It did teach me a little and I would recommend it to a beginner."
1,List of potteries is incomplete,"If you are a collector of Arts and Crafts Art pottery this book is not for you. Of the many collectible potteries for this movement (i.e. Rookwood, Grueby, Weller, Hull, Tiffany, Pewabic, Teco, Newcomb, Ohr, Chelsea, Fulper, Roseville and Van Briggle) only two (Roseville and Van Briggle) are included in this book."
4,"Too much fiction, not enough fact","This film would've carried more power if it had not used a ""cut-up"" of different art dealers and patched them into the fictional character of Max Rothman. The narrative is choppy as is the acting, but Noah Taylor's performance gives a reason to see this film. Taylor's portrayal, although a bit over the top at times, does create a humanity for Hitler that has never been attempted for and so a reason to see this film. It is an interesting film to be made at this time, in the midst of surging nationalism in the U.S. and the might-makes-right mindset of U.S. leaders."
4,"AN EERIE ""WHAT IF"" STORY!","The film ""Max"" poses a serious question: What if a Jewish art seller tried to help Adolph Hitler down the road of art instead of politics? This question is answered with exceptional poignancy in this eerie ""What if"" tale about Max Rothman, who tries and fails to keep Hitler on the path of art. John Cusak gives an amazing performance as Max Rothman. Noah Taylor gives an exciting and dramatic portrayal of the dictator-to-be, although he falls short of Robert Carlyle's portrayal in the still-superior CBS Miniseries ""Hitler - The Rise of Evil."" Fine supporting cast, including the talented and extremely beautiful LeeLee Sobeeski (I might have mispelled her name). The DVD features commentary and interviews that are fine for the DVD release. Give this film a look. Movie/DVD Grade: A-"
1,Dissapointed,"Although Sizzla Kolonji is one of the best DJ's to ever touch the mic, this DVD doesn't give you that. He flows into a microphhone in a hotel room for over an hour, that's it."
4,Boredom Lacks - Roxette's Back!,"The definitive video collection...at the time anyway. A little out-dated since their 2001 DVD release, ""All the Videos and More!"", but still a great piece of entertainment.On buying this it was the first time I had seen most of the videos featured on it. Coming from New Zealand, it wasn't that often you saw many by this fabulous Swedish duo.The only thing that I would've liked from this release, in order to make me give it 5 stars instead of 4, is the fact that the video came out before the release of the other singles from the greatest hits album. ""You Don't Understand Me"" is an excellent video (one of my top 5, actually), but I still would've liked to had seen ""June Afternoon"" and ""She Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" on it as well.It still rates highly on my you-must-have-this list. So please do yourself a favour someday. :)"
4,Very happy,Didnt think I would be able to find a copy of this book since it is quite old. Was very impressed with both the condition of the book and how quickly it was delivered. It was a perfect Valentines present for my boyfriend as it was the cookbook he grew up with and wished he had one of his own. Now his mom can have her copy back. Thank you!!
5,Divine Inspiration + Great Workout = AWESOME,"I am the type of exerciser that likes to get a good workout while also soothing stress and elevating my spirit. And this workout fits the bill. Great things about this video include: it is visually beautiful, it's got a great soundtrack, it gets energy flowing through your body in a balanced and harmonious way, AND it targets the big muscle groups in a shaping, toning, lengthening way (its toning action is sort of like Pilates, but with more flair and flow). I also love that it is so unique! There are a million yoga and belly dance workouts out there, but how many are composed of ancient Indian devotional dances that embody aspects of the divine feminine? Not many. If you hadn't guessed already, I highly recommend this DVD!"
5,GIrl from the Home.,"This book was very special to me.Muriel and I were considered ""sisters"" as we lived in the 'Brooklyn Hebrew Orphan Asylum"".She writes through the mind of achild.Her style is most engaging.She illustrates so intmately her harrowing experiencs in foster homes and the joys of the orphan home.Because I was a fellow inmate I can attest to the TRUTH of her narritive. It's a ""Can't put it down book"".Her tale is quite dramatic and VERY unusual.I opine this is a MUST read book.Esther Gerber"
3,Made for an Elf,"Absolutely not sized right, Way too small!Nice looking shoe and wish it would have fit."
4,Rea still making strong records...,"Espresso Logic finds Chris Rea taking life a little less serious than on his last two releases. The songs are generally more pop friendly and the lyrical commentary is brighter and more trival. Sometimes that doesn't work to good effect, like on ""Julia"" for example. But Rea maintains his moments of moody atmospherics, such as the dream-like intro to ""Espresso Logic"" and on ""Miles is a Cigarette,"" both being fine songs. Rea should have made the Top 40 on some format or another with ""Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea"" and the spectacular riffery towards the end of that track. Much the same could be said for ""Johnny needs a Fast Car."" If you only are familiar with Rea's work through ""The Road to Hell"" and found that album interesting, it would be worth your while to track this one down."
1,Crunk......I think not!!,"This book was awful!!!!! I read a lot of books that are ""street"", but this book was horrible I could not even finish it. I read 2 chapters and basically browsed through the rest, please save your money!!! If you want some real street drama read anything published by Triple Crown, or even Urban Books, but ""Crunk""...... STUNK!!!!!!! It's way too over the top. Trust me most books I read are fire, but this is terrible.I recommend ""Street Dreams"" by K'wan in place of this crap that calls itself a novel!"
2,I just don't understand,"After reading the reviews about Crunk and seeing the responses aimed at Ghetto Heaven I decided to read both books and give my opinion, and YES people I actually READ both books from cover to cover....now, I must say that Crunk left me befuddled. The conversations between what are supposed to be elected officials sounded like two street corner hoods talking about a fight on Pay Per View. The characters were not brought that much to life as much as their circumstances and situations. I believe that the effort of the THREE different authors should be applauded, but even for ""Ghetto Fiction"" this work lacks what is needed to keep the reader enthralled. I basically finished it because I set out the task before me. Not because it held my interest. I look forward to reading the sophomore effort from these three, hoping that this constructive criticism is taken to heart. Much love and luck in your future endeavors."
1,Horrible Book....,I couldn't even finish the book...I am happy I got this book on sale because if I would have paid full price. I would have returned it. Do not waste your money. If you are that interested in the book after reading the reviews...I will mail it to you for free!
1,PLEASE DON NOT WASTE YO MONEY.,"The story line is so catchy,but this book was some crap. i was SOOH disappointed,and once again i want my money back. 3 WRITERS!? Come on now man,3 WRITERS,and yall couldnt get ONE thing right? yall got writer's block or something?(...)Do us a favor and do not write anymore books,please."
3,too much crunk,"This book is very street. The characters are too hardcore. The female characters are too hoochie. Didn't take me long to read it because I wanted to find out the fate of the ""thugs"". I hope that there is not a Crunk II."
5,One Of The Best Urban Books!,"Nevermind what ""WriteOne NY"" says who's obviously on crack if they didn't like this book! High-drama, high-suspense is bursting out the pages of the story.Twisting and surprising ending makes you think about a sequel!A+++ for the Bad Boyz!!!!!"
5,A wonderful book,I love this book! It came to me on time and in beautiful condition. I would buy from this seller again any time/ Thank you Angela Miller/
4,It's good enought to buy,Not as good as #1. #2 slightly is better. But for a compilation album it is worth the money.
3,Amazon should get new shipping boxes for LPs,The disk is good. A live album from a great band.The album showed up in OK condition but it had been stuffed into a box too small for it and the dust cover got beat-up as a result.I wasn't about to return the album in an attempt to get one here without damage. The LP works well enough and the album art isn't so spectacular as to warrant hanging it up anyway.
4,pretty cool stuff,"I like this disc. Although the descriptions sound like it will be a blend of cultures, the music is basically straight forward, at least to my ears anyway. Nonetheless, the bottom line is that its good stuff. I find myself listening to these tracks more than most of the music in my player"
3,An interesting idea for a book,"The art is neat and interesting, the rhymes are awkward. We like it because we eat dim sum with the Chinese side of our family, and take our daughter to dim sum whenever possible. At 16 mos old, she is not at all interested in this book yet (if ever) although she loves most of her books. It is possible she will grow into it as she makes the connections between the book and Chinatown."
3,Not as good as the sushi book.,"I bought this book for my one year-old son, because he loves the sushi book in this series. Neither my son nor I enjoyed this one as much. I expected the book to be more interesting. The pictures are nice and it it does provide an easy way to introduce dim sum to a young child. Ultiimately though, after reading it to my child, I decided not to buy any additional ones in the series."
4,cute and charming,"At first, I thought this book wasn't the greatest. I thought the images of the food were a little strange. I still wonder why they didn't do cartoon drawings of the food or more realistic images. I'm not sure about the food looking like it's made of paper. And I think the pronunciation of the words are a little off too. But overall the rhymes are cute and charming. My 2 year old son loves this book especially because he loves dim sum! It's worth it."
4,Ambitious...but...,"Covering an impressive range of materials, Brown offers an ambitious treatment of later 17th- and 18th- century colonial Virginia from the point of view of the marxist-feminist tetrad: race, gender, sexuality, class. As the book's title tends to suggest, the work is strongest when dealing with the connections between discourses of gender and race (and to a lesser extent, sexuality). The wide scope of the book means, however, that some of the nuances and complexities of these discourses and their connections (and this is particularly true in terms of 'class') remain untraced. A second weakness is that the text lacks wider direction. Perhaps we can excuse the absence of explicit discussion of the study's theoretical assumptions. Less so the failure to engage directly with previous historiography and to 'signpost' clearly the argument being made over 375-odd pp. Subheadings help but only when descriptive; those drawn from primary sources are of little value in guiding the reader."
3,Where'd the blues go?,"Somewhere along the line Guitar Shorty lost the meaning of the word 'subtle"" when he hooked up with Alligator records. He just pummels through just about every song - loud singing, guitar playing, smashing drums, etc. Where's the blues? This is a rock CD.He has had some fine releases this past decade that mixed blues and rock but now he's moved to almost all rock. This is not his forte and this big change in his sound might gain him some new fans but leaves old fans like me puzzled.GET BACK TO THE BLUES!"
1,Alligator Should be Ashamed,"Only way to put it, this album is horrible. It hasnothing to do with blues at all, Shorty use to bea pretty good blues entertainer, so now he wants tobe a rock star?Not sure how this recording got past upper managementat Alligator, but it's only for the hardcore GuitarShorty fan."
2,"First Kress book, and probably last.","Reading the various reviews, I was looking forward to an interesting book on the struggles of travelling to and settling on a uninhabited planet, and then getting into first encounters. After reading it, I wouldn't use the word ""interesting"". It was fairly dull and uninspired. But it did help me fall asleep on several nights.Usually I try to figure out why a book was written. What is the point of the book. A fun story is legitimate. Maybe some interesting technology. Colorful characters. Better if there is philosophical or moral dilemmas, or some sort of analogy. I am not sure any of that was present in this. There was some religious commentary, but it didn't really go anywhere."
3,Adequate First Contact Tale; 3.5 Stars,"A solid but unexceptional first contact story. A group of colonists from Earth discover that their chosen planet has a small population of sentients who are also not natives of the colony planet. The humans find themselves in the middle of an interplanetary war between 2 other species. The plotting is moderately clever because of Kress' inversion of one of the usual plot devices. In many books, the usual device is human conflict with some kind of eusocial, usually insectoid, colony species. This is often accompanied by alliance with other individualistic species. In this book, the human allies are somewhat pacifistic colony-type plants and the enemies an aggressive mammaloid species. Kress also includes a number of human Quaker colonists to reflect this theme.Readers who enjoy this theme should look at Joan Slonczewski's neglected Still Forms on Foxfield."
2,No back support,It is OK for a double seat cushion or cut in half for two. However there is no frame and the straps with one cushion in back offer no support. It is all kind of floppy.
2,Nice idea but...,"In theory, this is a great concept. For a busy family, however, the space to write daily stuff is simply too limited/small. We also had trouble getting used to the days of the week going ""north to south"" rather than the conventional left to right. It's a great idea-it just did not work for our family. From the previous reviews, it would appear we're in the minority!"
5,Can't live without it!,This calendar is responsible for keeping my entire family organized. There's plenty of room to fit in everyone/s appointments!
5,Finally we're more organized!,"We LOVE this calendar! We've tried many others, but this calendar is the best. Instead of cramming everyone's schedule into one space, each member of the family has their own area. This makes it easier to read. I highly reccommend it. We buy it every year and you will too."
3,Great Calendar!,This calendar has everything I need to keep my family's active schedules all in one place!
5,Mom's Family Calendar,I can't live without this vital piece of communication for my family. It keeps my family on time and motivated for our daily endeavors.
1,liberal agenda,"this book has an extremely leftist bias. It is a book of primary sources but seems to only use excerpts from the primary sources that serve the liberal agenda, little or no conservative sources are consulted, unless to be made to look foolish. its very one sided."
3,...Long forgotten,"British power pop band ""The Records"" were never a great band, they just wrote and sang catchy pop tunes about love and heartbreak...nothing really serious unless you happened to be in love. The Record's debut and second album ""Crashes"" (which you can no longer find) are well represented on this disc with probably more crashes and near misses than smashes but needless to say ""Smashes, Crashes and Near Misses"" does give you a fairly good scope into the band and their short history. Songs like Starry Eyes, Teenarama, Girls That Don't Exist, Hearts Will Be Broken, Girl, Affection Rejected all reflected my youth, it was puberty going into adolescent for me and all those songs were the coming of age for me because I could relate to them. Such as having school girl crushes but being much too shy to do anything about it, The Records just put it down as music for me and it's nice being able to reminisce about the past through their music...it's a very welcomed addition to my collection."
3,Good forgotten band from the 70's,"The Records were a power pop band that employed the new wave chugga-chugga (muted barre chords) sound as opposed to relying on stereotypical jangly guitars. Nevertheless, the harmonies and hooks were sweet as could be and they had strong songwriting skills. ""Starry Eyes"" is by far the best song but others from this sampler are of such quality that a fan of power pop can certainly enjoy this worthy compilation."
3,Good retrospective of a footnote band,"This is an enjoyable disc that I bought to get two essential tracks from the era, ""Rock and Roll Lovesong"" and ""Starry Eyes."" The rest of the disc is not as strong as other bands but still an enjoyable listen."
5,Best of one of the best,"I, too, heard enough of the Byrdsian ""Starry Eyes"" back in the late '70s. But this record is a revelation. Really great, well-crafted pop songs that hit the spots. A high-point is ""Girl in Golden Disc"" with the great duo harmonies. The singer, Wicks, is still around with his ""new"" Records and doing great material!"
3,hard to comprehend in 2006,"Honor, loyalty, comradship and most of all the Regiment. Concepts difficult to relate to in the 21st century. Are they really relative? This question I really can't answer, but it is eminently worth pondering. This movie and its stage play predecessor pose those questions. One must understand the attitude of people living in a foreign country, the change this makes on their attitudes, combine this with being an infallible being in that country, add strong tradition to the mix and you have the crux of this extremely well acted and written film. I recommend it very highly"
4,"""Conduct Unbecoming"" is very becoming","Conduct UnbecomingThis mystery that takes on all the suspense of a courtroom drama keeps you interested to the very last moment. I have watched it numerous times with delight. The director and cast have delivered to the world a screen gem that will remain a classic for years to come. Michael York's audio commentary--a special feature on the DVD--invites the viewer into the mind of one of the world's finest stars of stage and screen. If you haven't seen it, treat yourself to fine entertainment by seeing it."
4,Love the Concept of Honor Portrayed Here,"This film has the greatest line I've heard about honor. When asked by a superior officer, ""Do you place your own honor above that of the regiment's,"" the principled young officer responds, ""No, Sir. They must be one.""Yep, that's it alright."
3,An adorable book of baby photos to accompany baby names,"A nice book to not only look up baby names and meanings, but to enjoy all those precious little people! I only gave it 3 stars because it is still after all, a baby-naming book. However, of all the books seen in this category, it is definitely the best! Very enjoyable!"
4,Beautiful Watch - Prominent Diamonds,"This is really a beautiful watch. It's a little heavier than some Bulovas. I think that's because it is a sports watch. It's not too heavy though and feels comfortable on my wrist. The only problem that I am having with the watch is the date feature. The date is quite small, and I am near sighted, so I can only read the date with my glasses on! If your vision is good, I don't think this will be a problem. Regardless it is very fashionable, the dial is easy to read, and the diamonds look just like they do in the picture. I really enjoy wearing this lovely watch. You can't go wrong with Bulova!"
4,classy glamourous sports watch,"I bought this watch as a special gift for a friend, and she will certainly appreciate it. She is the glamourous type, charming and outstading and this watch will fit her style, for sure. The discount bring it to a very reasonable price (169,00)."
1,Disappointed,This book is not what i was hoping for. Not very many exercises. Its more of a meditation book than an eye book. 90% seems to be about how to calm the mind and flush out worries. Waste of $5...
2,Too many side story lines,"This book drew me in, but I got very impatient with the side storylines. I had faith that there was a reason she included them, but in the end, I was left wondering, why were these other characters and their backgrounds explored in depth? I had to really concentrate to understand how everything fit together.If the whole book had been just about the family and the boy, I would not have been able to put it down. As it was, I was bored at times."
1,disapponted,"I am sorry to say that this book, as much as I care about the topic or topics, didn't address the inherent emtotions in any of the issues--at all. The judgments, the smugness, the way the poor child was just airbrushed out in the end (what happened to HIM?), it was a loaded subject, a brave topic to take on, but was tackled with a yuppie shallowness that said all too much about what was right for the yuppies. I'm sure they're fine. Scarred maybe, but fine. And anyway, who cares about Sah Harbor? Why not explain, at the very least, where it is? Presumptuous not to, no?"
2,A Member of the Family,"Compelling enough drama that is hindered by its mediocre character development. The only round, fully realized character is the narrator..... What is most striking is that the adopted child -- the very center of the plot -- is strangely missing from the story. The narrator recounts everything -- eliminating any immediacy or emotional involvement on the part of the reader. Furthermore, the author pays significant attention to tertiary storylines that don't seem to play any huge role in the action. Is distracting......"
5,CX-12,Item arrived quickly and in good condition. I bought this for my Sony CX-12 and CX-7 cameras. Because of their unique design when using the filter you negate their built in lens shade. In most instances this is not a problem but I found that at times I would get a lens flare caused by the filter.
2,Reveiw of Polarizing Filter,I had to return this filter because it had no effect on light contol and color saturation.
1,Show me the money,"The author's conclusion that the Korean War and subsequent security alliance was purely economic from the U.S. standpoint. This ought to be easy to prove using pure numbers. In his 288 pages of diatribes, the author never once shows us 1. How much money is spent on the defense of Korea every year 2. How much economic benefit the U.S. gains from Korea in foreign mililitary sales and trade. Even if he could not prove that in 1953 there were leaders in the U.S. government who could predict the conditions that would exist in the future, it would lend some credibility to his weak theory. In a book such as this, the numbers need to support the conclusion."
1,Socks fall down,"I bought one pair of these socks as a trial before ordering a bunch. I was impressed with how soft they really are. Almost plush. You feel as though they cushion your feet a little bit.Unfortunately, by the end of the day, they had fallen around my ankles.I've bought Gold Toe over-the-calf socks for years and they only fall when they are almost threadbare. So, no matter how soft or plush, socks that fall down from day one get a poor rating from me.-John"
5,never had favorite socks- NOW I do,"these ARE the softest socks in the world. if you like crew socks that are plush and thick, you will love these. someoe wrote they did not stay up all day, but mine did, I do have a largish athletic calf, so that could be the difference. i did have a sight binding at the top but not enough to leave a mark. i just bought 2 more pair. try a pair. you will love them"
2,Poor Quality,"The subtitles in this production were very poorly timed, and appeared rather unprofessional. The usual ""features"" often found in such productions are absent, replaced by several hours worth of poorly-made previews for other titles, few of which are even anime. In addition to filling free-space, the producers have utilized a dual-sided disc, filling one entire side with garbage."
2,Not impressed.,"When I found this DVD, I was thrilled. I am a HUGE fan of the 7 part manga series and expected this to be the same. However, I was wrong. While this DVD has an interesting plotline and the same three main characters: Subaru, Seishiro, and Hokuto, it chops up the original story from the manga and distorts it in a weird way.Now, I did like some of the elements of it (example: the relationship between Mirai and the older man. I found that sweet), but I rather liked the ending of the manga and was hoping they would cover it.If you are a fan of the manga, I would advise to stay away from this DVD. It is not flattering."
4,A bit of the manga...,"Tokyo Babylon is a good portion of the anime, but sadly if you have no background whatsoever on the story (which is hard to find, unless you are able to find scans of the un-released manga, can pick up whatever you can in watching/reading X/1999, or the like) or the characters for that matter, the anime seems quite useless. I suggest finding out information beforehand in order to appreciate the anime a ton more. ^_^"
4,"Subaru is cute, but what really happened?","^.^() The anime form of this tale really doesn't explain everything, and I find that a real pity. Also, those who aren't famaliar with manga might not get it. It never really explains Seiishiro's relationship to Su-chan, or either of their powers. When I first rented vol 2 I had no clue what was going on, though I still found myself enjoying it. Later I found out much more about the story and bought both the tapes. Anyone who already knows the manga, or at least knows the cast, will most likely love this tape. (Come on, it has Subaru! You gotta love it!)"
3,Good deal except for the sound,"As said, this DVD contains both Volumes to CLAMPS story, Tokyo Babylon. I've had the chance to watch both the tapes and the DVD and I would have to speak more for the tapes. The 2nd Volume on the DVD had some serious sound problems that continually came up throughout the show which stole a lot of the attention from actual story and animation. The people who did the transfer of this DVD did a horrible job, otherwise I would have given 5 stars. The reason it gets three is the sound."
5,A Reprinting?,"Having recently purchased this item, this item appears to be exactly the same as the ""other dvd"" of this same title? (Which has excellent, informative reviews if you do a search on Amazon.)I won't bother with a dvd review here; the reviewers on the other dvd's page captured its essence perfectly.Needless to say, this OVA has an excellent few side-stories to the manga. However, as far as I can tell, the only difference between the two dvds is the color of the cover."
2,A pale shadow of the manga,"This anime takes the wonderful and adorable Tokyo Babylon manga and makes it look bad. It gets points from me because I adore Subaru and Seishirou, but the dub voices are awful, the plot is, while CLAMP-ly original, not on par with the original manga (which has not been translated in the US, but you can find translations and scanlations of it online), and the animation just doesn't hold the same charm that other CLAMP titles do.I've heard said about this that you either love it or hate it. Personally, I was disappointed. Some adore it, but most haven't seen the manga, of which this is a sad, pale shadow."
1,horrible,"This review refers to the DVD.The English voice acting is quite bad, that's well established by now. Oh well, there is the Japanese track with subtitles, right? Not quite. The Japanese voice acting seem decent enough but the subtitles are outrageous. The timing is wrong half the time (the text appears before someone speaks or long after they finish speaking) and even with my minimal knowledge of Japanese I can tell they left a lot that was said unsubtitled or partly subtitled. Worse than that- they sometimes added dialogue that was not in the Japanese script. What makes the makers of this DVD think they know better than the script writers of the OVA? Their job is to translate, not rewrite the script.The video and audio quality is also unimpressive- not what you would expect to see on a DVD.Overall- quite bad."
4,What about tha eye?,I really loved this show. I just bought it today and i'm assuming that this is the end of the show as well. If it is then what about seishiro eye. They say he lost his sight in his right eye in this series. Othe then that i really though it was enjoyable.
1,its BAD very BAD,"if i could i would rate this smelly series i would give it 0 stars!.it has to be the WORST anime tape that i have EVER seen!.the story line is very very slow like a sleeping drug,bad acting and NO VOILENCE what so ever.take my advise grab your dvd copy(if your unlucky enough to have bought it)and commence an attack on it untill its toast!!!"
5,"WHAT AN AMAZING SURPRISE, SHAKIRA ROCKS!!!!","I became a fan of Shakira in the Laundry Service Era. I loved the CD even though I knew it was not her best. Then FO1 came. and I got eternally hooked with La Tortura (and its video). I was longing for the English counterpart and definitely I was surprised at the growth that Shakira has had. I cannot regret of any single song as far as music goes. I may regret of the lyrics at ""How Do You Do"". BUt still it's a great CD. I think I can't get enough of Hey You, Animal City, Dreams For Plans, Timor, Something, Don't Bother, and Costune Makes the Clown.Definitely the best CD I've heard this year"
3,Disappointing,"I love some of Shakira's songs...especially her Portuguese/Spanish versions. I bought this album after hearing her fantastic song, ""Hips Don't Lie""...expecting more of the same ilk. Unfortunately, the other tracks are nothing like ""Hips""."
2,Thank God for Wyclef Jean,"I was very disappointed in this CD. Outside of the track with Wyclef and the duet with A. Sanz, the cd is terrible. C'mon Shakira, go back to your roots and true fans before you 'crossed-over'."
4,Not bad - maybe a little flat in parts :->,"I do like this. It took a couple of listens to before I really started to enjoy it more. I cannot - CANNOT - stop listening to Hips Don't Lie. I love that song. I could keep listening to it until forever. Other than that fantastic song, there is Hey You (upbeat and cool) and Your Embrace (a really nice ballad). There are some songs on here I still don't like. Some are a bit political and I personally don't like that influence in the music I listen to.There are a lot of artists today that don't write their own music or lyrics. She has written all the lyrics and the majority of music which proves how talented she is. This is a cool and funky album - well worth checking out. It's got quite a few potential hits on it."
4,Oral Fixation II,"esta bien ademas de que esta de moda Shakira, lo malo fue que venian 2 discos y lo mejor seria si todo estuviera en uno soloGraciasR O C"
1,Big disappointment,"I've loved some of Shakira's previous songs, and when I heard ""Hips Don't Lie"", and the fabulous ""Don't Bother"" (I LOVE those lyrics), I just had to get the album. I put it off for a while, but saw it at a semi-reasonable price, and bought it.My oh my.It isn't good!!! The only two standout tracks on the album are the two previously mentioned tracks. I listened it to it twice. Normally I can love an album on first listen, very rarely will I get bored of it on a second listen. Nope, not with this one. Shakira has a lovely voice, but the rest of the tracks are nowhere near as upbeat as ""Hips Don't Lie"" and ""Don't Bother"".Don't bother buying this album unless you are a true, die hard fan of Shakira. Don't waste your money."
2,Not Impressed,"I don't know what I was expecting. Most of the lyrics were beautiful and kind of emotional, but I just didn't really like any of the tunes, with exception of ""Hips Don't Lie"", the only ones that caught my attention were ""Timor"", ""Dreams For Plans"" and ""Something"". Her mind is brilliant as evidenced by her word choice but this album was really very dark and melancholy. While I enjoy darkness in tunes...I don't want to be bogged down in it. If anyone wants a free CD - email me. I'll be glad to mail it to ya. Sorry if I hurt you fans, but that is my honest opinion."
2,<Don't bother> is right!!!,"As I've said previously, any re-release of an album simply for a profit is downright wrong. Especially, when it happens relatively shortly after the album was originally released. However the improvements of ""Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 Part 2"" do not make it a necessary purchase. The obvious hit out of the bag is the crazy ""Hips Don't Lie."" From the horns blowing, to the melodic hook, to Wyclef's rap; the song teeters on perfection! And a must have, though I recommend you download it from your local itunes store. The second edition to this package is ""La Tortura"", her monster hit from the accompanying Vol.1 disc. Though Vol. 1 is entirely in Spanish, it is a great album and includes a total of 3 versions of the single. So what are we left with?? The same underwhleming album that greeted us just a few months past."
1,Shakira Is Terrible,I think Shakira sucks a lot. She can't sing. I don't understand her musical appeal.
5,brill,great cd i think timor and how do you do are the best tracks on therei would recomend this to any one
2,stick to singing in Spanish!,"Shakira has definite potential for making good music (Laundry Service), but Oral Fixation isn't it! Hips Don't Lie and La Tortura are the only two songs that are worth listening to on this cd. Laundry Service is a better Shakira cd because it has a mix between Spanish songs and English songs. But making an English singing cd cold turkey isn't cool. She wanted to explore both fields and that's fine, I'm cool with that. But Shakira, please go back to singing in Spanish!"
4,"Not flawless, but still intriguing","Latin-based international pop diva Shakira sets speakers on fire with her latest (though oddly-named) offering Oral Fixation Vol. 2. Her smash ""Hips Don't Lie"" is, of course, the standout track here, but surprisingly most of the remainder is consistent and well-written, well-performed and well-produced. Of course, it's not perfect, but it's definitely worth listening to for its Latin-influenced English music performed in the unique vocals of one of the industry's most talented singer-songwriters."
3,Unfair!,"For Shakira fans who supported her by buying the initial release of the album it's unfair to have to have a re-release with 2 new songs added. Next time I'll wait to buy her CD or just rip it from someone else. In this day and age when artists are constantly asking their fans to buy the CD instead of burning a copy from a friend, I would expect the artists to show some loyalty as well. I'm not buying the same CD twice for 2 extra songs, even though those 2 songs are probably the best on the album."
2,eh... she's getting kinda annoying...,"Aside from those horrid Nike commercials that made me laugh and want to kill her at the same time, ive been hoping to like her follow up to Laundry Service. this One had such promise. Rick Ruben producing, a rock approach.. but it just comes off a bit forced. And listening to her theological critiques is like Taking Ricky Martin seriously as an artist... c'mon. Pink Floyd, you're not. The songs just aren't that good. I got bored first listen and was really disappointed. I like Laundry Service a lot and her first two in spanish are pretty damn good too. But maybe she's trying to hard to appeal as a rock act, i dunno. Or just needs to write better songs. I guess i should have guessed from these really cheesy record covers on the ""Oral"" series."
1,My hips don't lie either... and they know this music stinks,"Every one is obbsessed with ""Hips don't lie"". Don't they relize that the songs horrible. Well, so is every other track on this album. Save your money to waste on something that is atleast some what decent."
2,shakira,"i know who you are shakira i been know her sence 99 in the 9th grade her older cd,s are better much she like jet li his english movies are awful but his chinesse movies are better much . unlike gloria estefan was able crossover and win hearts but shakira is very diffrent 1. she already famous in the latin world this cd is awful where are the thivies was better than this .i know thaila also try to crossover but it fail she success in crossover but english cd,s are bombs i hope she come out with a better one madonna new cd,s sucks too my deadsy cd is better than this bomb and i like shakira a lot i hope she does next time. beyonce solo cd sucks buy ciara the media won,t praise her as hard as they do beyonce and her is cd better."
1,Not Dance Music,"This CD is not dance music, which is all my narrow mind is interested in. It may be great for listening or whatever, but its not dance and it should not be listed under dance pop.john"
1,Dum Dum Dum,"I thought Hips Don't Lie was absolutely lousy. Shakira is not sexy shaking her hips. Shakira, is not sexy. Apparently, Hips Don't Lie (HDL, don't make me type that atrocious title again!) is this album's best song.I smell month-old sweaty socks."
4,Solid,"While I liked her previous album better, this is still a great album. I haven't found a song that just jumps out and grabs me either, yet I still want to listen to this CD over and over again. This album, once I heard it, did cause me to turn around and buy the spanish version of this CD. I think all Shakira fans will enjoy this album as well as funs of rock."
5,The Best Shakira CD Yet!!!!!,"Oral Fixation, Volume 2 by far is the best CD made by Shakira to date. Shakira sings in a variety of ways and shows that she does have an oral fixation, which is singing. The songs range from the soft songs such as, ""The Day and the Time"" and ""Your Embrace"" to the heavy songs like ""Animal City"" and ""Costume Makes the Clown."" She gives other languages a try such as Arabic and Hebrew from ""How Do You Do"" and sings beautifully in French in the opening stanza of ""Something."" Her vocals are by far better than that of 2001's ""Laundry Service."" There is a song for everybody on this CD. I highly recommend this CD."
5,The True Shakira Comes Out,"This CD is cimply great. You can see Shakira mixing together all different types of music and making it sounds really good. The lyrics are clever and well-written. ""How Do You Do"" and ""Timor"" stand out because of their topics and messages. The first contains a set of questions to God while the latter addresses the egocentric views of developed countries. Oral Fixation vol. 2 is a must-buy. So is vol. 1."
3,Not so great...but get Hips Don't Lie if you already own this album,"I was also disappointed with this album. Then I heard Hips Don't Lie and wondered where to get it. Imagine my surprise that it's now on this album. Hmmmm...like other reviewers I got angry. So I thought I'd go to Shakira's website (shakira.com) and write an e-mail. But guess what? Right on the first page it lets you know that if you own either Oral Fixation album, you can download the song for free. All I had to do was pop the cd into the drive, the site recognized it, and boom....I now have the song. I'm much happier now!!!!"
2,So disappointing,"I bought the cd because I loved ""Hips Don't Lie"", and I was hoping for the rest of the cd to be in the same vein-a good beat that you can dance to. Timor and La Tortura are pretty good, but the rest of it is really bland pop-could have come from anybody."
3,An Alright Album,"Allright so I was very exciting after Oral Fixation Vol. 1 and after hearing this album the excitement seemed to vanish. I definitely prefer the first of the two Oral Fixations. To give credit to each song, here I go:1. How Do You Do 4/52. Don't Bother 5/53. Illegal 3/54. The Day and The Time 3/55. Animal City 2/56. Dreams For Plans 3/57. Hey You 2/58. Your Embrace 4/59. Costume Makes the Clown 4/510. Something 5/511. Timor 5/5I might seem like a hard rater but this is in total honesty. By the way, how is this C.D. enhanced? I'm tired of inserting it into my computer and nothing happens! If anyone has an answer to this please feel free to e-mail me at pupi11717@yahoo.comThanx!"
2,Don't Bother,"I bought this album because of ""Don't Bother."" Yes, it is the best song on the album. The rest of the songs are hardly exciting. Her lyrics are excellent, but musically, nothing really stands out. In other words, if you are wondering if you should buy this album, take a hint from the first release from this album- Don't bother."
3,Not Quite What I Expected,I should have looked at the tracks closer before ordering. Did not have all Shakira's hits that I thought it did. My mistake.
4,A pretty decent album if you can get past some of the obvious filler,"Just to make it short and sweet.GREAT TRACKS:How Do You DoIllegalCostume Makes The ClownYour EmbraceDECENT TRACKS:SomethingTimorThe Day and the TimeYour EmbraceHORRID TRACKS:Pretty much all the singles, and Hey You.Overall I'm not a Shakira or modern pop fan, but I think this is a solid album and a good way to kill some time. Recommended, just as long as you're prepared to hit the ""skip"" button a few times."
2,"Die-hard fans, stay away!","I've been a fan of Shakira for many years, and I believe that her first two albums, Pies Descalzos and Donde Estan los Ladrones, are still her best works by far. If you've watched Shakira grow since day one, then you probably won't enjoy this album, because this doesn't even compare to the old Shakira.If you're a non-Spanish speaking American Kelly Clarkson, Avril Lavigne, Madonna fan, then you'll probably enjoy this album. I mean, with all due respect, I only like one song on ths album (Don't Bother), and that's because it reminds me of ""Si Te Vas,"" a song featured on Donde Estan los Ladrones. Everything else is just a mess.I still love Shakira, but this album is a huge disappointment for her more mature fan base."
1,shakirastakwer,the worst female performer ever seen with shrieking voice coupled withe most stupid lyrics of all time what apair
3,Tu es mejor en espanol,"I love Shakira and have listened to her for years, but honestly she sounds so much better when singing in spanish. I am not a fluent speaker of spanish, but you can tell she has more feeling for the songs she writes and sings in spanish, than those in english. This album is good, but not her best. Hightlights on this album are Hips Don't Lie, and the re mix of La Tortura. I would recommend her first album, Fijacion Oral 1 over this."
2,A Disapointing piece of work from such a big talent,"Shakira is an amazing artist and by no means is the rating of this album meant to imply that she's talentless. But this album just disappoints. There are really very few songs worth mentioning and she insists on peddling her American audiences with a bleh mixture of pop/rock. Rick Rubin supposedly produced on this album, what went wrong Rick? No more mojo left for Shakira?Fijacion Oral Vol. 1 is ten times better executed. Don't bother getting lost in this translation."
1,Shakira Spanglish,"Honestamente ya no se que decir de una ""artista"" como Shakira. Es pésima cantante y su voz ahora ya no es igual a la del gallo Claudio, ahora intenta ser sexy, pero se queda en la voz de una persona que le estan apretando el cuello. Horrible CD, peor que el otro. Lo unico rescatable es la portada, Shakira es muy bella pero que no cante!"
1,How she sings in english sucks!,"Whats up rockeros/as... I listen to the full CD in Ritmo Latino... and I just whant to say when Shakira sings soff-rock in spanish ella realmente canta bien... pero cuando canta en ingles... realmente tiene una horrible voz... so realmente son criticos de todo tipo de rock (R&B[Black Rock & Roll],Rock & Roll, Rock, Soft Rock, Heavy Metal, Punk Rock, Hardcore Punk, Thrash Metal, Speed Metal, Black Metal, Death Metal, Grunge, and Alternative Rock)no compren este CD... es la pura neta."
3,Just good!,"This album it's more comercial... Fijacion Oral Vol 1 it's much better...The Shakira's english is poor, it is not understoodIt seems concentrated more in pronouncing well that in interpreting... I hoped much more of this album"
4,simple look and installation,"Purchased these to replace existing knobs that were identical but brass, so screws went in exact same holes- no drilling needed. Product exactly as desccribed in listing. Overall, a good product."
4,A good release,"This is a really good album with many different sounds within. For those of you who heard the first album ""Tears in Rain"", this is definately a step up. Not to say that ""Tears in Rain"" was bad, far from it, actually, but ""Light and Shade"" is just much more developed in terms of sound and vocals. More complex, If you will."
5,A must have for Northwest Maritime enthusiasts,"Jim Gibbs is simply the guru of Northwest maritime history. This book ranges up and down the west coast with fascinating tales of shipping mishaps and contains plenty of photographs. If shipwrecks interest you, ANYTHING by ""Shipwreck"" Jim is for you!"
5,sky conference box,great product when using with Skype. It also comes with a handset. it has all the buttons to navigate through the Skype functions. compact and it can travel with you. USB interface and no need external power. it also has input jack for the microphone if needed. The volume controls work well with the PC. Fast delivery from DSI.
4,Earrings with a contemporary look,I wore them to a party. Got lots of complements from friends. They add a conptemporary flare to my traditional chinese dress.They are a bit too heavy. My earlopes got tired after the night was over.
2,Her moves are awkward.,"I find Karen Voight's choreography extremely awkward.Also, she will often switch movements without cueing. She'll cue you as she's doing the new movement, so she's already switched by the time she gets around to cueing you. Very frustrating.On the plus side, it's a decent aerobic workout, if you can deal with the awkwardness and the cueing deficiencies.For better instructors, Gin Miller, Gay Gasper, Kathy Smith, Keli Roberts, Christi Taylor (if you're an advanced stepper, Christi Taylor is the best!)"
4,Great Mother Gift,I got this for my mom for Christmas and i cant wait till she sees it. The only thing i didn't like is i ordered 12 pack and all of em where the same. i thought they where going to be different.
1,Piece of Crap,"I bought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas. She played the sound game. She always got the answer correct, but 60-70% of the time the bear still said it was incorrect. The rest of the family tried it and it did the same thing. Therefore, this is not a learning toy and it is no fun. After trying a few times and the bear telling my daughter she was incorrect when she actually was, she decided she hated the thing and didn't ever want to play with it again. I took the thing back to the store and got a refund."
1,"Good Idea, bad toy","I have to agree with the first two comments. We went to check it out after my 4 year old saw it on TV and liked it because the bear had glasses just like him. The product seemed decent in the store, so we bought it. He has only played with it once or twice since Christmas. The only time he had fun with it was when I got mad and yelled at the thing because it wouldn't do what it is supposed to. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY THIS JUNK!"
2,frustrating!,"Although this bear is very cute, with his glasses, my 3 year old son doesn't enjoy playing with him in the manner he's intended to be played with because it's frustrating. Even my 6 year old son gets fed up of trying to get him to do what he wants. They follow the instructions, wait for him to stop talking, but he still doesn't seem to work properly...and try getting him to be quiet! Supposedly you can tell him ""Good night Koby"" and he'll yawn and go to sleep. After trying it a half dozen times, when I walked into my son's room and found Koby sitting there, talking to himself (!), I flipped him over and turned him off!"
1,I guess I was the only one,"I don't listen to country or cristian, so maybe in song form it is better, but I found the story as well as the illustrations to be rather creepy. Daddy is the king and Daugher is the QUEEN? eeeewwwwwww. I know it had to rhyme and whatnot, but this whole poem/song/story is icky to me. there is a line in it about loving you no matter how much you squirm or something equally blech. even where it isn't sort of inappropriate, it is sickningly shmaltzy and when my child takes this golden book from the bookcase, i have to hold back the bile, while trying to make up new words for the charachters to say. and the illustrations are nasty. the people look like marionettes, there isn't much about this book I can recommend. I keep meaning to chuck it."
1,Didn't get the correct product,"A completely different book came in the mail than what is pictured. It is not the Butterfly Kisses book, it's a book of letters written by dads to their daughters."
1,not very good...,i always hate giving a book only an hour but i just couldnt read any further. don't wast your money on this.
5,This book truely helps you in understanding the bible!,I bought this book really not know if it would help and I can't put it down!! I have been trying to read the bible and always get confused and end up not reading. But with this book it puts everything in a whole new light. It is very easy to understand and read. I definately suggest this book to anyone looking to study the bible!!
5,Must Have,It broke the bible into understandable pieces. A very great tool that makes exploring the Bible an achievable venture the family could embark upon
5,hare/brained hits,"i grew up on bugs bunny and this one tape reminds me of the times my grandpa us to tell us about his days of growing up , especial the part about the hillbilly's. cause i'm from the north carolina mountains. i'm 27 years old and i still love watching this one,but i can't find it on vhs tape any where here. i've been looking at all stores and no one has it. this is my first time on the net and i hope some one could help me keep my memories of my grandpa alive ,cause he's been gone for 10 years and the hare/brained hits reminds me of him when he was young. even its is just the part about hillbilly hare is my favorite one of all of bugs bunny."
1,Careful,This company has serios issues with construction! Bolt in back can break and you might fall backwards while holding your baby!
1,Spend a few more and get a better one,"This chair is not comfortable at all. The back is very stiff and does not recline easily. The Ottoman is very small and low. The chair too is very small. Overall, I think since the whole idea of having this chair is to relax and fall asleep, the idea is not met at all.I think one should spend a little more and get something comfortable and enjoyable not a compromise."
4,Awesome value,"While I agree that the cushions could be a little more plush, for the low price you won't find a better value in a glider. We purchased the glider nearly a year ago. We use this chair to death and haven't had a single negative issue with it . . . no noises, no sagging cushions, etc."
3,rocker,the rocker is nice looking but the cushions arent all that comfortable in the rear area after sitting in it your butt in sore..
4,Worth the money,This was the least expensive glider and definitely worth buying. You might want to wait until your baby is born and try out gliders at the store. Some babies don't like them!
4,Great Chair for a Great Price,"Saw this chair at major baby store but only in the peachy color. Only saw the denim on-line. I was nervous to purchase without having seen it in person and was skeptical about the price being so low and wondered if it would be of good quality. The chair is fine, I am very happy with it. Obviously, it is not as cushioned as some of the higher priced models I looked at in the store but for the money the quality is good and it will definitely serve its purpose for the next year or so with the new baby. The denim color is nice and true to the picture and assembly was easy - I assembled it myself at 8 months pregnant. I would recommend this chair highly for the price and quality."
1,Shipping Issues,The rocker looks great. Just can't bring myself to pay $90.00 for shipping. A bit of gouging going on by this supplier.
2,No good for breast feeding,"I purchased this chair for my wife to breast feed our 4-month daughter. My wife complained the chair is not wide enough to hold the baby.I put my daughter diaper, wiper, toy, and story books on the chair. It's the only one function for me. ..."
3,Can someone please help...,"I received a glider already put together and now it's falling apart. I don't know if it was the person who assembled it once they bought it, or if it came out of the box pre-assembled wrong. Since I don't know how much of it already came assembled I was hoping someone could email me to advise what part/parts of the chair come pre-assembled and what parts do you have to put together yourself... The part in question on my glider is the glider base. PLEASE EMAIL ME: serena_smiles_sd@yahoo.comTHANK YOU IN ADVANCE!!!"
3,"OK Value, but noisy!!!!","My wife and I bought this glider, because it matched the baby's room and it ended up being a good chair for it's price. But after a few times of usage it started to squeak and quite frankly it is annoying to a point where it wakes the baby up. I tried exchanging it, but Babiesrus didn't think it was a good reason for exchange. 2 thumbs down for the exchange policy."
4,Good for the money,"If you are not willing to spend $500-700 on a glider, this is a good product for the money. With all the items a baby needs, I was not willing to spend a small fortune on a glider but I've been assured they are a necessity. This glider has a wonderful gliding motion. The cushion you sit on is very comfortable, but the back cushion is not quite thick enough. Another criticism is that the fabric is not really denim, as it states in the description. It's denim in color, but is a sort of woven polyester blend. The wood is a nice honey oak color. Overall I am pleased, and it was very easy to assemble. But for those willing to spend a bit more money, I'm sure you can get a more comfortable product."
2,NOT DURABLE; Cushions Are Cheap- ottoman cushion sags too,Well the chair is fine BUT... The cushions haven't lasted at all. I am about to have my second child and looking to replace all the cushions. I really only used the chair for breast feeding for the first year with my first child and the cushions looked so bad(sagging/flat) after that I didn't want to make it apart of my regular living room/den furniture. The ottoman- I tended to put my feet in the same area each time I used it and now the indention is permanent and no longer comfortable to use. Same with the seat cushion it's no longer comfortable. After looking at prices to replace the cushions (around $200) I think it would be a better investment to spend the money on a chair with better cushions. Instead I am looking into making my own replacement cushions. Just make note that if you buy this chair to intend to use for more than a few months the cushions will no longer cushion after ONLY A FEW SHORT MONTHS.
5,A must have!,"I'm telling you that I am so impressed with this chair. Amazon.com you are the greatest! I ordered this chair last week and it came in 2 business days FedEx. After trying to get this from the actual babies-r-us store and finding out that it was an ""on line"" special only, I went ahead and ordered it. Even with shipping it was ...less than the store and it came with the ottoman. I'm telling you, if you are on a budget setting up your nursery, this is a must have! My baby is due this week and I am sure that I will be spending alot of hours in this chair. It is very comfortable and is made with great construction.......don't pass this one up!"
1,Disappointment.,Be warned - Two things not listed on the item specifications and packaging (but is stated on Belkin Webpage)...Not compatible with OS10.3.x and DOES NOT SUPPORT MULTI-FUNTION PRINTERS!
4,Printer Switch,"A Low Cost alternative to Wireless Switching. This Printer share device works exactly as designed. Flawless, quick switch from one computer to another. Easy to install the software on both computers, plug in the cables to your usb ports, and ""presto""! works Great. Only bad part is cables are not provided :~("
3,Not Automatic,"The product was difficult to configure and did not work as expected. I expected that the printer would AUTOMATICALLY be available to two different notebook computers via USB. In reality, software is involved plus the need to click on an icon in the System Tray. Even so, the switching did not produce consistent results. Both notebooks were running Windows XP Home Edition.It was easier to manually switch the cables so I'm not using the device at this time."
1,Just doesn't work,"Followed all directions ... connect two PCs ... to one printer and it simply does not work!It deserves zero stars. Not only do I hate it, I hate that I have to take it back!Move along and continue in your search for something that works."
2,Doesn't really work on Mac any more,This peripheral sharing switch works mostly with Windows operating systems and can be used only for printers.
2,shockingly censored,MPD Psycho 'may' have been enjoyable on japanese television with all the gore blurred and softened in frame (CENSORED) for general mass consumption - however as a dvd release it leaves alot to be desired - why bother?it is an essential component to the understanding of the mysteries and without it - it is all unfathomable.i feel for Miike - how could they not have found the uncut footage - surely there is a master copy somewhere?? it does his work no justice!!!this CENSORED dvd collection of the tv episodes may be unrated but its real rating is a simple G for 'generally boring'.the extras have a few shots of the FX sequenses uncut for diehards only!
5,My favorite ski movie!,"I've been skiing and watching ski films for fourty years. MSP is the best producer of ski movies out there and this one is my favorite. There is a second DVD in the box called ""Hit list remix"" in which the skiers used thier favorite clips and mixes it with thier music. It is what starts my season at first snow every year since it came out!!! I had to have watched this movie 20 times and it never gets old!"
4,Great Instant Video,"Wish Amazon had more Matchstick Productions available for instant viewing. Hit List is one of those films I could watch over and over, particularly when fall comes and I start thinking about snow. It's great having it in the Amazon cloud so I can pull it up whenever the ski bug bites me."
3,Excellent quality,"Excellent paint. Should make it in much larger jars. They should make ALL their paints in much larger jars. NOT a toy, as listed by Amazon. They should get their act together. This is probably TOXIC and dangerous for children. It is not for a child to play with."
1,Pretty but not what I expected,"These are pretty but I was very disappointed because I thought I was getting pink pearls with the Swarovski pink crystals. The pearl is not real and actually feels plastic. I own several pearl necklaces (including pink) and these will never be worn with them because you can definitely tell the difference by looking at them, without even touching them, no luster at all. Very disappointing. They should have been listed as 'faux' pearls."
2,Didn't see any results,"I used this product for about 3 months (the amount of time one bottle lasted for me), morning and night immediately after I washed my face and never once did I see any improvement, long-term or short-term. I'm a female in my mid-20s seeking a preventative-care product for the looming fine lines around my eyes and mouth. I wasn't searching for any miracles, but at the very least expected a product that would temporarily fill in any creases. This product did absolutely nothing for me; I might as well have been using a regular moisturizer."
1,Another Bad One!,"I was given several books from a friend written by Dr. Jeffrey Lant. I suffered through 2 of them and thought I would give him one more try.But, they all seem to be the same. Lacking any informational value. This one in particular really was useless. I would not recommend that anyone spend their valuable time reading this."
1,A waste of money,The book is just one long hail of the author and it has nothing to do with the subject.
5,Pipe Band,"Bought this CD as used. The case was in great condition and the CD itself was almost unmarked. Good CD if you like bagpipe music, which we do as we are from Scotland and play the bagpipes."
3,"Great film, lousy video quality","Well, the other reviews have said it - this is a FANTASTIC restoration, and the availability of the 1925 version makes it even better. You get TWO prints of the film for the price of one.But, the ghosting effect on the restored version is simply awful. Folks, there is not a SINGLE clear frame in the whole film! Every frame is a composite of two films frames, and the whole thing makes the film look very clear but very blurred at the same time.It's an incredible shame that this wasn't handled correctly. There is NO excuse for a film of this high quality to be spoiled by poor transfer to video. None.But then, some people will watch this and not notice anything wrong. Your mileage may vary.The other features on the two-disc set are absolutely worthwhile, and having the choice of soundtracks is fantastic.So, caveat emptor on this one. There's much to recommend, but a big disappointment as well."
4,A Dullened Masterpiece,"I did enjoy the film very much, the old effects and color tinting were fabulous, but I was diappointed to find out that the muscial score was redone in a ""nineties"" fashion. I would not call such a release a superb feat in film restoration. True preservation and restoration is trying to present the film as close to the original as possible. It's great that the print was restored, but the original score should've been revived along with the print. It would be even worse if the score no longer existed, and sometimes that is the horrible fate, just as bad as an eighty year-old nitrate film turning to dust. A great film, but the editing and dubbing ruined the experience. If you are a ""perfectionist,"" I suugest seeking out an original version of the film--if such a thing even exists."
4,1925 Better than 1929,"I am greatly disappointed with the 1929 version of the film. I thought it was going to be better than the silent one because it had sound, but I was wrong. The 1925 version is better than the restored one. Even though the restored version has sound, it takes the orginal and rearranges everything. They took the beginning of the 1925 and put it after Christine sings in the 1929 version. The person who plays Carlotta in the 1925 version is now Carlotta's mother and the Carlotta is different. The four stars is given to the silent 1925, the restored one is given 1 star."
2,how to ruin a great movie,"The Phantom of the Opera is a great movie. My only bone to pick is the horrendous score in the alpha video edition. TPotO is a dark tale, it's a horror story for crying out loud and the score is happy, repetitive, and inappropriate. It sounds as if someone took a greatest classical hits cd and slapped on the movie. I can't complain too much because of the price, but still someone could have put a little thought and effort into it. The picture is amazing though. I enjoy the fullscreen version and the original black and white with the color masquerade scene.bottom line: great movie, but find the best version."
2,Cheaply priced for a good reason,"This 1980s GOODTIMES videotape of the widely available Lon Chaney silent classic ""Phantom"" is dubbed from an unrestored b&w; print (no color flourishes here) in the LP mode-- a problematic speed on many VCRs. Audio track is linear only. NOT HiFi.If a fine quality VHS is your goal, recommended is the KINO edition ofPHANTOM OF THE OPERA(1925). Restoration includes original color footage (in spots) and an excellent music score."
5,Awesome!,"[...]I like old movies and this 1925 movie is awesome, thrilling and a little bit spooky! I read a review that says Erik was a normal man who hid underground after he was disfigured but Erik was born with a disformed face. That's how it was in the book and in this movie they never actually said why his face was like that. It was the Phantom Of the Opera movie that came out sometime in the 40's that they had it that his face was disfigured when someone threw acid in his face so maybe she is mistaking the facts from that movie with this one."
5,The greatest horror movie ever,"I'd been wanting to see the Phantom of the Opera for a long time but I never knew it would be this good. The plot is about a deformed man that lives in the depths of the Paris Opera House. He's madly in love with Christine, an opera star, and he'll do anything (even murder) to get her. I liked the movie because the Phantom's face was about the scariest thing I've ever seen, and it made it ultrascary becuase in every scene the Phantom was in, the screen semed to be in shadow. The reason that Lon Chaney Sr. looked so scary was because he used wires to extend his eyes and gums."
4,Very Nice,"A bit of a let down after the ALW musical, but a fabulous interpretation! It is very true to the origional book, an aspect which most Phantom movies have lost. Lon Chaney is spectacular as Erik, the escaped madman who longs for the love of Christine Daae, played by a lovely Mary Philbin. I recommend getting the DVD so you can have better sound and visual quality. And yes, it does have that famous unmasking scene which ""made women faint with fright"" when it first came out in theatres."
1,Silent Phantom of The Opera,This particular movie wasn't what I thought it would be. I have several other movies but this one was silent and in black and white. It was for my granddaughter who is a big fan but is visually impaired and couldn't see this one at all. I would not have ordered it had I known this first. It would be a good collection for someone with no visual problems though.
3,Remember Blackhawk films?,"Once upon a time there was a film preservation company named Blackhawk. They used a 1925 edition of ""The Phantom..."" and not a 1929 re-issue version to make their VHS tapes. There are differences, most of them beign additions and some do not have the technicolor section or it looks ""muddy."" Just as a word of advice to a purist, watch what you are going to buy.I am glad I bought Blackhawk films back in the day...."
1,Not Worth your money,"this is the first and original Phantom of the opera, the silent film version i watched the first five minutes of the movie and shut it off. I warn you do not waste your money on it. Unles you like these types of movies. The newest version is a lot better."
3,Lon Cheney as the Phantom,"Though I'm not a fan of silent movies, I found that I truly enjoyed this version of a modern movie I love. Not that many years ago I would have never admitted to even liking opera, but a group from work went to see a live production of The Phantom and I have been an addict, er uh fan ever since!"
4,Who needs dialogue?,"The 1924 silent classic stands tall among the bevy of imitators.The combination of music, shadows and color tinting of a black & white film work to render any dialogue an impediment to this film.Lon Chaney's hideous face and his body language are more than enough to keep any viewer on the edge of their seat. Simply stated, the film is worth watching again and again so as to better understand all the theatrics apart from dialogue that make a film a classic. Hitchcock realized this as many of his films went minutes without a spoken word.Take a hint producer's of today. If we want to be read to, we'll listen to audio books. If we want to see actors act, we will watch The Phantom of the Opera, 1924"
1,Another Cheap Rip Off!!!,"This Delta disc is nothing but a bad rip of the old Lumivision laserdisc. Which means the picture won't be as clean as either of the Image DVD versions now available. I love the movie poster that comes with it, but it is a crying shame about how they just flat out STOLE their video source from another company. This might be part of the reason this edition is not available anymore....."
5,a must-own for fans of gothic horror,"Image's lavish 2-disc set does justice to Lon Chaney's riveting performance as the ""Phantom of the Opera."" This has long been one of my favorite films, but felt as if I had only seen it for the first time after watching the 1929 edition included in this set. The print is beautiful, and the commentary by Scott MacQueen is insightful. The technicolor has been added to the ""Bal Masque"" scene, and there is a gorgeous scene of a red-cloaked Erik poised against an anotherwise blue-tinted background. Plus there are loads of stills, promotional materials, alternate music and soundtracks, as well as the 1925 cut of the film. Absolutely essential for fans of gothic horror."
4,Lon Chaney is spectacular!!,I purchased this Ultimate Edition after receiving another edition by DigiView in Oct 2005.Lon Chaney is truly magnificent!!This Phantom is better than the newest movie and the other version with Claude Rains.
5,Excellent book,"I'm learning Calculus with this book and I'm finding excellent!My college changed Swokowski's book (it's out of print in Brazil!!!) by Anton's book. This book -together with Swokowski- is highly recommended for the beginners undergraduates. For me, Anton is very better Stewart's book -for instance-. Therefore, buy ""Calculus a new horizont, 6th edition!"
4,Yay for Calculo!,"It was exciting. I can't believe how excited I was to practice Calculus once I opened this book. How amazing! Logarithmic and exponential functions! Analysis of funcations and their graphs. Intregration, oh integration! I like Calculus."
4,Nice,"As an Agatha Christie fan, I love the story. You do not know the murderer till the end. The acting is wonderful, typical british. Costume and sceen is beautifully selected. The only pity is the DVD effect is not obivious, maybe because the movie is comparably old - 1981"
4,A little hokey but true to Christie,"The acting was a bit stilted in this one but, all in all, not a bad rendition of a Christie favorite (I'm a HUGE Christie fan). The filming comes off as sort of soap-opera-ie for the indoor shots but the outdoor scenes are A-O-K. I confess (as a Christie apologist) that this is one of Christie's more inplausible mysteries but the director pulled it off darn good, without making his actors look ridiculous. I was especially impressed with the length of this film, quite long, and a good partial afternoon of DVD entertainment as far as I am concerned. To summarize, if you're an absolute Agatha Christie NUT, go ahead and consider this one a 5-star rating... however, if you are randomly looking around for ANY film to watch, regardless of genre, and have never seen a Christie mystery, you might find this to be a THREE.... (or a TWO!). I liked it a great deal and very much recommend it to appropriate fans."
5,A must read!,"I have a copy of this book but it is much briefer than the 400+ pages mentioned in this listing. Nonetheless, this diary is a must read. Young Moshe presents a far more detailed look at the trauma of a teen in terms of his Jewish faith and the situation he is in than The Diary of Anne Frank. This is not to denigrate Anne's diary-it is a must read also. This book by Moshe is worth tracking down."
2,cgi looks cartoonish here,"I have no problem with the acting but the cgi effects here look like a cartoon figure is on the loose. Scy fy makes lots of very low budget movies that I find tolerable and ok but this one is hard to watch. I disagree about vanessa angel and the rest of the cast , the did a fine job actually with what they had, but the effects for this era are very poor. If this was a 1980's cgi effort , then you'd say it was fine but this is really poor. If you want to see some awesome sabertooth cgi then check out 'walking with prehistoric beasts' or the sci fi show 'primeval'."
2,Okay,"This movie was .... Okay. For people who like movies like this will like it. But it's not got very good actor's. The story line is good, There wasn't much cursing at all. The monster. He wasn't very real looking at all. Violence. It was okay.All in all if it's like on sale for $9.99 or $5.99 or less. I'll buy it. If your looking for a bloodfest scary movie, this isn't the one. But if you like all the movies likethis you'll injoy it. I did."
1,Snorefest,"To predictable and to utterly stupid to get any higher, but still it wouldn't make the top 100 worst movies ever made. It is very bad, and you already know the plot. A beast of some sort terrorizes and kills a few people, and team set's out to investigate what did the killings, they meet the beast, they run around and scream for 45 minutes and magically defeat the beast at the end, and everyone lives happily ever after. Typical monster movie schlock. I suggest seeing something else, cuz I can't really find any redeeming qualities about this reched movie!"
3,LITTLE BIT LONG IN THE TOOTH,"SABERTOOTH joins the countless direct to video shockers that would have been better with a bigger budget and a more talented cast.David Keith, fresh from his non-acting role in DEEP SHOCK, plays an Indiana Jones ripoff great tracker, who delivers his lines as if he were on Ex-lax, and afraid the motion may motivate? Vanessa Angel should probably take Acting 101 to remember the basics; John Rhys Davies should just be ashamed at himself, and Josh Halloway looks good in tee-shirts, and tries to maintain a sense of character.The effects on this go from bad to horrendous, but even then, credit is given that the film does have some suspenseful shocking sequences.Not a real howler, nor a real horror, this movie is one you could rent, but don't buy."
3,Decent fun overall,"This is a fairly amusing low-budget sci-fi flick with good-looking girls and a not-too-serious script. It's not scary by any means, and the sabretooth looks like a silly cartoon, but it works as a way to spend the evening laughing with a few friends"
2,Watch Jurassic Park or Ice Age instead,"Jurassic Park is a good movie in which prehistoric predators are cloned, Ice Age is a good movie with CGI sabertooths. This is why SciFi should never have canceled MST3K. Basically its just another disgrace to horror/monster/scifi movies. The characters are about as bright as slasher victims are, the plot takes stupid twists, the killer animal eats way too many people for it to believably have actually killed. Bloody gory deaths, only a few characters live, the dumb blond scientist who cloned the big mean kitty goes crazy and for some reason thinks her monster will obey her and she is corrected the hard way ,blah, blah, blah blah, ( I also loved how the nerdy guy was freaking out because a cougar showed up and despite all the noise he was making, the cougar was laying down on the ground with what looked for all the world like a relaxed smile on its face)You get what I'm saying. Besides Diego is a much cooler CGI sabertoothed cat."
1,Avoid this Guide,"This study guide is rife with errors. Even if someone were to give you the book at no cost, you should still not read it. It does more harm than good."
2,Every Fish But...,"If you want a book that shows you a picture or a drawing of every cichlid that there is then this book is for you. BUT if you want to learn about the fish you see then this book is not for you. It mentions very little in the way of behaviour, eating habits etc. If you want to keep cichlids in an aquarium, rather than go out and catch them, then this book isn't for you. I was very disappointed after I bought the book. It shows lots of very beautiful pictures but tells you little more."
2,A lot of short medley tunes!,I would have liked to have known that many of the songs I wanted were in medley form. I would have purchased a different album.
2,A Great Compendium,"This album is a delight. It features the artist in two club appearances from near the end of his life and is a treasure. Contents include some favorites from earlier albums and some new material all freshly cast with his timeless, sharp edged wit. Singer, songwriter, actor, playwright, author. A tough act to follow."
5,"An excellent account of Koei-Kan, written by a true master.","All of Sensei Frost's wisdom and knowledge of the art of Koei-Kan Karate-Do has been displayed and documented in this, an excellent reference for both begining and advanced Karate-ka. As a Sho-Dan (1st Degree Black Belt) in the Koei-Kan system, I found this book invaluable not only in my own training, but also in instructing new students. This book offers an extensive account of terminology common in Koei-Kan training, history, the ""family tree"" of Koei-Kan, as well as discussions on Budo, Dojo, Anatomy, Kata, the essence of Kiai, techniques, and Bogu (a full contact exercise unique to Koei-Kan). Whether you are an advanced student in Koei-Kan, a new student, or just an interested party, KOEI-KAN KARATE-DO: PRACTICE AND PRECEPT is an excellent choice to begin your journey into the heart of Karate-Do and the spirit of Budo."
5,ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE PRACTICE OF KOEI KAN,"THIS BOOK,LIKE NO OTHER YET PUBLISHED, GIVES AN IN DEPTH VIEW OF THE MIND,SOUL AND SPIRIT OF AN AMERICAN MARTIAL ARTS ADEPT,SCHOLAR,AUTHOR,AND WARRIOR. B.FROST,LEGENDARY IN HIS PROWESS, AGAIN DEMONSTRATES HIS GENEROSITY BY PRODUCING THIS WONDERFUL INSIGHT INTO THE SECRETIVE STYLE OF KOEI KAN KARATE DO, AND INTO THE AUTHOR. BRIAN FROST, WHO HAS DONE SO MUCH TO SHAPE KOEI KAN IN AMERICA, ALLOWS ALL TO SHARE IN THIS MASTERFUL WORK! WE SHOULD LOOK FOR MORE FROM THIS MASTERFUL MAN."
4,very well written,"sensei frosts book was very well written, however as a 20 year student of the koei-kan system and a nidan. I feel some of the training concepts were taken from other sources and not just sources that are or were taught to the general koei-kan students"
1,hair product,I ordered 6 and at least half of them was old. Meaning that the procuct had gone bad and become as hard as a rock.
2,Very difficult to adjust.,"does work but is not east to adjust. It is nearly impossible to get the bolts tight enough to hold the monitor in place. Had to get another allen wrench and add an extension on it to get enough leverage. Once mounted you are pretty much stuck with that position, other wise go through the entire process again."
2,"awkward, clumsy, hard to use",Very difficult to adjust; barely holds the weight it claims to support. Plastic caps on joints pop off very easily. Just all around awkward and difficult. Not what I'd hoped for.
4,Easy to understand,True books are great for allowing young kids to explore non-ficiton topics in a easy yet informational way.
3,A yarn too well spun,"Contrary to public perception, this is NOT The Teenage Opera.RPM, with my co-operation and support, merely created an illusionary ""What If...?"" scenario - a compilation of tracks, including the only three genuine T.O. tracks ever recorded (""EFTO,"" Sam"" and ""Weatherman,"") that were produced during the general time vicinity of the ""Grocer Jack"" release. Aiding and abetting the illusion was Phil Smee's fictitious cover and inlay art, so brilliantly conceived and executed, movie-poster-style, that it further fueled the imaginary ""sound track"" deception.Those who are genuine Teenage Opera fans, take heart. 30 years after the release of ""Excerpt From A Teenage Opera,"" I finally revised, updated and produced a genuine, COMPLETE version of the work, faithful to the original vision and spirit, entitled ""The Teenage Opera - TEMPO."" General release of this work is projected for the fall of 2003.Mark Wirtz"
3,Childlike Psychedelia Circa 1968,"I bought this for the song ""Grocer Jack"" and I expected that to be my favorite track, but I was wrong. There's an amazing song called ""(He's Our Dear Old) Weatherman""! That one is worth the price of the CD. Another highlight is a pop version of the Tomorrow song ""Hallucinations"". (It's called ""Mr. Rainbow"".)And there are remixes of a few other songs of theirs, plus a different band doing ""Shy Boy"".The disc contains some tasteful easy-listening instrumental music. The opening number stands out. Some tunes sound like they were designed for little children to listen to.That one track, ""(He's Our Dear Old ) Weatherman"", makes up for any weak tunes on this record."
3,I like it!,"When I played this CD I was pleasantly surprised.I actually liked it; making allowences that it sounds like 1967 --some pop psychadelia (with some unfortunate lyrics of that genre).However the songs are pretty catchy and I like the vocals by Keith West.I also enjoyed the instrumentals: most have very unique, creative gooves and melodies.This is really not ""THE"" Teenage Opera --only some songs are from that original concept. I thought the music had a taste of Small Faces, some Ray Davies, Burt Bacharach, and Brian Wilson (in fact, this recording sort of plays like a very British ""Smile"".)"
5,Plantronics Headset,Outstanding product. Exceeded all expectations in performance and comfort. Searched several sources and Amazon was $58 less than the next lowest price and shipping was free. Extremely satisfied.
4,Good value - Comfortable,"I was happy with this product. Very clear, great noise cancellation. People tell me the sound quality is great. It is also very comfortable to wear. I hope you buy it at Amazon because they are so much cheaper than everyone else."
2,What they didn't tell me,"I ordered this headset because a colleague uses one. It arrived and guess what? You cannot just plug it into the phone. I have a headset ready phone and evidently need some sort of polaris cable to plug into the phone. Now I have to order this cable, pay another shipping cost and wait to be able to use the headset."
4,"Not Daniela, but solid","Ivete seems to have taken the Axe torch from Daniela Mercury, which is fine, and she certainly does a better job with it than, say, Jay Leno with Carson's.Ivete puts on a great show and also produces fine records. There are some fantastic, peppy songs on here, including the title track. I think ""E Tudo Mais"" would be catchy enough to be a hit with any set of lyrics in any language (and as it is has a nice Cole Porter-esqe lyrical run in the chorus). ""Tum Tum Goiaba"" is silly and fun.This is a totally engaging album, and definitely worth purchasing. But if you want the real thing, check out some Daniela Mercury too (especially ""Electrica"", her recent live album)."
1,Great while they last.........A SHORT LAST!!!!,"This mug works great while it last however, don't expect the mug to last longer than 6 months before it cracks. I actually bought this mug twice the first one lasted about 6 months before I notice the crack. I at first thought it was because I left it in the freezer too long.Yet the second one I bought and this one only lasted 2 1/2 months before it cracked. I also only kept it in the freezer no longer than 2 hours however, it still cracked.My advice if you HAVE to have is buy 2. One for looks and the other to drink out of even after the crack happens."
5,Peter Tork & James Lee Stanley's voice blend like butta!,"As a complete show of 20 songs with funny banter, this show they did at ""The Coffee Gallery"" is just plain enjoyable! The harmonies between Peter and James are heavenly! For the followers of Per Tork's solo career, there are plenty of Pete's solo songs. Even Monkees fans with love his rendition of ""Pleasant Valley Sunday"" and his famous live banjo piece, ""Cripple Creek"". The unsung hero singer/songwriter/actor James Lee, has talent!! An excellent songwriter with a voice from above! Fans will know his songs from his albums including my all-time favorite ""Touch Like Magic"". For the price it's listing for today (6/23/12) This is a steal! I recommend any Peter & James collection!"
3,A sturdy bag,"This is a really sturdy, ready-to-go bag. Something I didn't really like was the magnetic clasp is right in the middle of the top of the bag, so someone can just reach right in and grab something. On the inside it only has two pockets and I kind of wanted more than that. The inside fabric is a dark green with white dots. It also has one kind of small zipper pocket on the inside. The strap doesn't really adjust to largely.I'm not sure I'll use it too much. It's not really a messenger bag either."
5,Compelling literary fiction,"Edges does what the best literary novels do. It makes you think and feel and takes you into a world not your own. The novel explores the boundaries in our lives: between countries, between a mother and daughter, and between lovers. Exquisitely written and haunting."
1,Edges O Israel O Palestine,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. The descriptions were so favorable, well I was terrably disappointed. First it didn't deliver even on the story line, much less the editorial reviews. If she had put as much effort into developing her characters as she did in describing noxious smells, and depressing landscapes it might have been a better story. At the end I didn't feel like I really knew any of the characters, and really disliked several. The first chapter starts out very slow with unending descriptions of the plane, her mother, clouds, etc. I should have put it down then. There are so many great books (fiction and nonfiction) about the early years of Israel you shouldn't waste your time on this one. If I could have given it less then 1 star I would have."
2,If I saw it in a store I would have passed it by.,It's very light weight. Can't put it in the oven covered. If I saw it in a store I would have passed it by.
2,Never used this pot...,"To be honest, I only purchased it to get free shipping and it was not how I imagined it would be. That's what I get I guess! Seemed very cheaply made and I ended up selling it in a garage sale."
2,Great nursing pillow - Bad Playgym,"As a nursing mom, I find the boppy pillow an invaluable resource. I us it almost everytime I nurse. It is especially great for when your baby is a newborn. However, the 5 in 1 concept leaves little to be desired. If I put my baby on the pillow with the toys overhead, she is constantly wiggling until she is off the pillow and no longer under the toys. She needs to lay flat to learn to roll over. Another problem is that everytime I have to nurse her, I have to unhook the overhead gym from the pillow. I wish I would have purchased the plain boppy pillow and a different playmat for my baby."
2,"good idea, bad for baby",i thought this was the best thing since sliced bread... boy was i wrong! the only two things this is good for is 1)the boppy pillow by itself to help support baby to sit up and 2)the toys to play with (not attached). to use this item as a play gym is not a good idea for baby... they can't move anywhere or learn to roll over. they are stuck in the pillow and always in an upright position. i actually disasembled this and only use the pillow and toys and went and bought the fisher price basic play gym (much cheeper) that is better for baby to use. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
3,SO-SO Gym for Baby,"I was given this as a shower gift and thought it was going to be wonderful as both a nursing pillow and gym. I never used it as a nursing pillow, as I had a C-Section and found the pillow too painful around my middle. I ended up just using a soft bed pillow. I don't like it as a play gym for the baby, either. As he swats at the toys, he slides off the pillow and ends up stuck on the floor, unable to move and frustrated. For a lot less money, we got a Fisher-Price gym where he can lie flat on the floor and roll around or stay put as he pleases!"
3,Alright - OK,"I thought this looked great and I've heard so many wonderful things about the boppy. But, I didn't think it was comfortable to nurse with at all. I thought my baby would love laying on her back and playing with the toys, but she would cry after only a few minutes. I found that it was because she would slide down and get crunched up. I had just a regular gym for my 2 other children and they loved it. Now that she's 3 months, she'll tolerate laying on it. I'm hoping that she'll like it more as she gets older. I'm also hoping that I'll find more uses for it, like helping her to learn to sit up. But, as yet I wish I had just bought a regular gym. The sassy toys are nice though. She does really like those by themselves."
2,Mine didn't like it,"The boppy part is great for nursing when little, and sitting up when bigger, but the gym part was a total bust. My baby was never into it, even if he was mildly interested in the toys when I took them off. Not worth the money. Buy a plain boppy and a more interesting activity mat."
2,Not impressed,"I got this as a shower gift, and I do not like it as a play gym because my 3 month old son slides out of it within seconds. I tried using blankets tucked around him to hold him up into the pillow but he always would wiggle his way onto the floor with his head in between the two ""arms"" of the pillow. I ended up buying another playgym where he could lie safely on the floor and kick as much as he wants."
5,Love it!!!!,"We added this to our baby registery after reading several good reviews. I was more than happy with our choice after I set it up. It has multiple uses and does not take up much space, which is helpful since we are in an apartment. I like the fact that this product will be useful to the baby for more than 6 months. It is well made and you can add and subtract toys as you wish so the baby does not get bored. It is one of my favorite baby items."
2,OK product,"Just an OK product. I have a few regular boppy pillows, which I love. I didn't find a use for this. It would be way too much work to use this in place of a regular boppy and clip and unclip the top part (they're not easy to use). We do like the toys which come with it though. Don't waste your money on this product, nice idea though."
2,BOPPY LESS,"Very pretty design, looks great but it's not really practical. Skip the boppy on your registry and get ""MY BREST FRIEND"" (nursing pillow)which can be found on the internet if you plan on nursing your baby."
3,Small Fit,"This pillow is wonderful for play! The colors are very stimulating for baby. The quality also seems to be very high. However, I was not able to use it for nursing, as it would not fit around my waist. I am average to below average in weight and size and was disappointed to find that it did not fit a postpartum woman."
3,Great as a play gym but...,"unfortuantely, I am unable to use this for nursing. First, the pillow is tight around my waist. I am of average weight... perhaps the manufacturer thinks all new mothers are a size 2! Next, my baby seems to fall asleep when lying across the pillow while nursing. However, she really does enjoy being propped up on it for play."
3,Not quite what I expected,"The Sassy toys that came with this product were not quite what I expected - the mirror toy does not face so that the mirror faces my son when he is facing up, no matter where I put it, and the other toys were fairly low quality (just how much fun is a plastic donut?). The packaging for the 5-in-1 says that it can be used for tummy time, but the boppy is too thick for my 3-month-old to comfortably lay on his tummy. I replaced the toys on this with other Sassy toys that I received with another playmat and it is a fairly satisfactory toy now, but my son still prefers another playmat that we purchased for about [money] less."
3,Not as a feeding pillow,"I found this pillow uncomfortable to use as a nursing pillow, but baby now 3 months does like to lie on her tummy and back to play for short periods. I like the toys and how they are interchange, but they also hang quiet low, so don't think it will get much use once baby is sitting up. Baby does like the black and white strips."
4,Boppies are a must for breastfeeding mothers!,"I love my boppy! It made breastfeeding my children so much easier, and so much more comfortable. We got the 5 in 1 thinking it would be great alternative to the playmat, but it wasn't. It's a pain to always convert the boppy into the play gym, and it's really not ideal until baby is older because the baby look so uncomfortable propped up rather than lying down. What we did was take the toys from the gym and added it to our baby's gymini. They toys are great...they are Sassy, and our baby loves them! The Boppy is also a great alternative as a support pillow when baby is learning to sit up on his/her own!"
5,Smart for Travel!,"Granted, if used as both a nursing pillow and play gym on a daily basis, attaching and removing the arch would be cumbersome. However, for use as a play area at home, and a combination nursing pillow / gym when traveling, it's a smart buy -- one less item to pack in the car."
4,A boppy gym enthusiast,"I had registered for a different play yard until I read so many negative reviews about the arches not being sturdy. So...I bought this boppy gym & dearly love it! After our son was born, my husband & I used the pillow alone to support the baby (& our backs) when we fed him. Our son didn't care for the gym until he was almost 3 mos. old, but now he loves it, & he is fascinated with the green smiley face/mirror, cooing & smiling at it all the time. If your baby doesn't like to be confined, don't use this item until he is long enough for his legs to extend out of the pillow. Oh, and the arches are definitely sturdy!"
4,I love this product!,My baby loves this.. she will lay there and look all day if I let her! She is most attracted to the white/black side bars. The boppy pillow is a great fit for her to lay on. This isn't a 'must have' but it sure is nice and also fun to watch your little one 'ohh and goo' over it!
2,Good for breastfeeding,I dont breastfeed but I was going to and this worked great for the week I did. But for bottle feeding its too much hassle. And I still havent put him in the play gym part. I keep a cover on it and I think they should put vinyl or something on the back of the cover so it wont go thru to the pillow.. Once you wash the pillow it is basically ruined. And the covers should have a space for the hooks for the play bar to pull through so u dont have to take off a cover everytime your baby wants to play.
2,looked like a good idea but....,"This looked like a great idea and was well reviewed. Now that my baby's had it for 3 months (baby is 4.5 months old), he has used it a total of 6-12 hours of his life.He really enjoyed it in the beginning, but tired of it quickly (in the space of 30 minutes over 3 days), and because he eats a lot and the toy-supporting arches hit me in the face when I undo them, the nursing aspect of the toy isn't really exploitable."
3,Just buy a regular Boppy.,"I absolutely adore the Boppy pillow, however I wouldn't spend the extra money on this one with an arch. My baby was very frustrated when she was young because she couldn't reach the toys to bat at them. I'd suggest the Gymni Deluxe play gym instead. If you disconnect the arch and don't have a good grip on it as well it can fling back violently and smack you as well."
2,Buy a regular Boppy and a separate playmat,"The Boppy pillow is wonderful for breastfeeding and provides good support for babies in sitting, but I hardly used the hanging toys. It was just too inconvenient to hook the arches on for only about 5 to 10 minutes of play. Then, when it was time to nurse, my Boppy wasn't readily available because I hadn't had the time to remove the arches. I'll be buying a separate playmat for my next child!"
2,"Just buy the Boppy itself, and invest in a better gym","I loved the Boppy pillow -- it was invaluable for the first 12 weeks or so that I nursed. After that, I didn't need the pillow so much anymore and set it up with the playgym attached. My little girl would just cry every time I tried to lay her in it though. I finally switched the toys that came with this Boppy for some different ones, and she liked it better, but she's constantly sliding off the pillow and hitting her head on the floor. Also, the links that come with this gym are terrible! It's impossible to get toys on and off of them because they're not at all flexible like other links I've tried.Do yourself a favor and buy the plain Boppy pillow but a different playgym. We have the Carter's butterfly gym and my daughter loves it. I know that the various gyms by Tiny Love are good too."
4,Perfect for feeding,"Makes for a comfortable baby & mother during feedings. I use while nursing, my husband uses it with bottles. Daughter likes the toys. Only one complaint, does not have removable cover and lost some of its shape once washed."
2,Didn't work for my little one.,"I received this item as a shower gift, and am not happy with it. The pillow itself is great for nursing, but my daughter hates laying in the pillow to use the toy bar, it is very uncomfortable for her and makes her cry. So her grandma sewed loops on a little quilt, and atttached the toy bar to it. Now my daughter loves playing with the toys. She is 3 1/2 months old."
2,Took off the toys,and used it as a regular boppy.When my daughter was small enough to lay still in the boppy she couldnt reach the toys. Now that shes bigger she gets bored with them too easily and its useless.
1,GREAT IF SHE DID NOT CRY SO MUCH!,"MY DAUGHTER REALLY LIKES THIS GYM-BUT THEN SHE ROLLS OUT OF IT AND SHE CRIES. SHE IS UNCOMFORTABLE AND SHE WIGGLES-THEN OFF SHE IS AGAIN AND THE CRYING BEGINS. THE SAD THING IS SHE WANTS TO ENJOY IT AND PLAY WITH IT-IT'S JUST SO FIRM IT ALLOWS HER TO WIGGLE OFF. AT 3 MONTHS BABIES KICK ALOT AND ON A BOPPY THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT ROLLING RIGHT OFF IT!BUY A GYM THAT ALLOWS THE CHILD TO LIE FLAT, IT'S JUST EASIER."
1,Nothing New,"Consists of old material by each artists. No duets. The sound quality is poor. Waylon's selections are from the ""Live at J.D.'s"" sessions. They have been issued and reissued far more than they deserve. Willie's material is rarer, but no better. Packaging promises Waylon doing ""A Moment Isn't Very Long"", but it is definitely Willie performing the song. Pass on this one."
3,Willie Waylon together once more,As most of the records by willie & Waylon. is well wourth each cent of the cost. I like it.
3,&#65533;but certainly not funky,"Formed from the ashes of 60s psych outfit The Churchills, this Israeli band signed to A&M records and released this album in 1971. Tracks include 'Man in the Crowd', 'Triangulum' and 'Champs'. Traces of psychedlia can still be found on some, whereas other songs mark the band's move towards hard rock, a style they would embrace in full on their next album, the excellent 'Jericho'"
3,Not sure it works,Either this stuff doesn't last very long once applied or my cats like it because after a thorough dousing I'm still finding tufts of yarn pulled up from a new throw rug. Maybe whichever cat is doing this (I haven't caught the culprit in action) can get past the bad taste.
1,This is not a safe product,"After purchasing this product, I was able to read the ingredients and the warning label. This thing was inundated with warnings and unpronouncable ingredients. It said to wash any skin that it touches, etc.Similar products like Bitter Apple, do not have such toxicity warnings.I would not recommend this product. If it can't be good for even our skin, it definitely won't be good for your household stuff or your puppy's mouth and GI tract."
3,"Good, but not Great","Product works to keep our dog from chewing for about a day. However, my dog went from chewing to scratching! Also, no matter how careful you are, you WILL end up with this product on your hands and that will make your food unappetizing for a day or two. We now use gloves when handling it."
1,My Cat loves the taste,This product does not work. I bought it to put on cords and my cat has since chewed more cords. The taste is aweful for humans but he seems to love it. THIS DOES NOT WORK.
5,Great Watch.,"I finally decided to replace my old Seiko that kept perfect time, but looked dated and was rather scratched after 30 years (yes thirty). I have a smallish wrist, and the big chronographs are just to much for me. I saw this titanium watch and love the light weight and reasonably sized face. I've had it for about 2 1/2 months so far and had no problems. It keeps time as well as my old one, is super comfortable to wear and looks great (for me that's jeans and T-shirts, but it would look good with dress clothes as well). It would be nice if the hands glowed in the dark, but I knew that going in. Also, my 48 year old eyes have a bit of trouble reading the date, but that's no big deal either. Two thumbs up!"
5,IT LOOKS AND FEELS GREAT!!,"This watch looks just as I hoped it would. And, I really like the sleek design. As a titanium watch should, this one is light weight and doesn't feel bulky. I think anyone wouldn't be disappointed if they purchased this sporty Seiko."
1,Do not buy this watch,"I have owned several of these through the years, and with everyone, it winds up getting water in the watch when it defiantly should not have. It seems to happen after the battery needs to be replaced, which leads me to believe that they do not seal properly once they have been opened.(using multiple jewelers) Seiko, will not correct, nor fix this issue with out charging in excess of $100. After hundreds of dollars spent and multiple issues I have finally given up and will spend the money on a watch that the manufacture will stand behind."
1,a nice wear all the time watch,"I could not get the stars to be selected. I would give the watch a 4/5 stars with lack of luminiscent hands as main problem.I was looking for a replacement for my inexpensive watch that i lost recently. I wanted a watch that was water resistant, light weight and reliable. I have an old sieko kinetic watch that I decided to not repair and bought this watch instead. It is a good looking watch, with a locking titanium bracelet band which is light weight and attractive. I wear the watch even in the shower every morning and appreciate its water resistant quality. my one compaint is not having luminescent hands to see the time in the dark. the band is very comfortable and nice looking and it does not pull on arm hairs etc. I am hoping the locking fold over clasp will hold up over time but since i dont take the watch off much, I expect it will. van"
5,wonderful watch,I received this amazing watch 2 days after placing order here. It is new and seems wonderful. How could I express my love for it? It is made by Titanium which make it never fade I think. And it is adjustable so it can fit my slim wrist.
3,Indiglo Does Not Work!,"Thw watch is great!! However, one big problem, the dials were suppose to light up in the dark and they do not work! We are also not sure how to get a replacement one that does work. Other than that, it was a great watch and a great purchase!"
1,Stay clear if you are looking for the current Oaks.,False advertising. I was looking forward to the current Oaks singing gospel songs and what I got was a set of old recordings of earlier Oakridge Boys recordings. That would be okay if the current Oaks weren't on the cover. That is false advertising. I thought I had found a good gospel CD because the current Oaks have a great sound. I was sorely disappointed. Whoever created the cover for this CD and the current Oaks should be ashamed of themselves.
3,IS Current Group,"Some decent cuts from their early gospel days of the 1960's.Side note: Yes, this IS the current group on the cover, which I would complain about, as well. Richard Sterban, Duane Allen, William Lee Golden (before his long beard), and Joe Bonsall, as well as their keyboard player at the time, Garland Craft ARE featured on the cover."
4,No funny aftertaste,I have searched for a whey protein mix that tastes good for a while now. I mixed this with milk and a banana and it tastes pretty good. I was pleased to get the greens as a bonus.
1,Simply disgusting!,"This is the WORST tasting protein drink I have ever tasted, and I have tried many that were awful tasting.I luckily bought only one envelope of it. The ingredients look superb, but somehow the makers of it must think that as long as it is healthful, palatability is out of the equation. It's too bad Shakeology is outrageously expensive, because their chocolate flavor one is amazing in taste and chock-full of great ingredients."
1,You really do get what you pay for!,"I am in receipt of this product and am extremely disappointed because it hardly has a scent to it - to me its almost as if they had placed into the bottle water with just a small touch of the perfume. I am going to return this product for a full refund as its a waste of money and I'd rather spend my money on the real thing from the store. In addition, the actual product came in its box; however, did not have the plastic shell to it which tells me that the product was opened and tampered with. Poor don't buy this."
5,Perfume,Just like the picture. Designer name on all the product and it smells just like the designer perfume. I like this one and will order it again.
5,Cool Water,Very prompt and what I expected. A good buy. Amazon's shopping experience has always made things easy and reliable. Have come to rely on Amazon purchases.
5,Tennis: Play to Win,This text is one every professional coach should own. Inside you are given insight into how a small country came to train some of the games most dominant champions such as Ivan Lendl and Martina Navratilova. A coach who can apply such a system to modern tennis will benefit from this book's structure and insights. The text is well organized and you can find easy reference to most any facet of junior training. Numerous drills and illustrations cover all aspects of the game.
3,Decent strap for the price,"This strap does a decent job of keeping your instrument in place while spreading the weight out over the contact area in a very comfortable manner.While I have a few favorite straps I like much more, they also cost significantly more as well. This strap is not recommended if you need your strap to slide around while playing, as is my preference when I'm playing electric, but great if you want it held in place, which is what I need when playing acoustic."
2,Too short!,"This strap is well-made and potentially comfortable, but at its longest length, shorter than many other straps I own. Disappointing but not worth returning."
2,Expected a little more,"I play an acoustic and the strap really is too short. It should have been about 5"" longer. I read the reviews and I thought maybe the guys who play electric below their belts thought it was too short, but apparently unless you're 90 years old and play your guitar under your chin it's just too darn short. The other problem is that the strap adjustment loops on the back don't lay flat. Therefore, you have a constant bump on your back where the strap adjustment is at. I would have sent this back but my wife threw away the packaging so I'm basically stuck with it."
5,Just Depends how big a fan you are,"I lost this album a couple of years ago, and was So happy to be able to find it here. While I enjoyed the tracks from Shock Treatment, the ones I found I just could not live without were Tim Curry's. It is true that ""Baby Love"" seems quite flat, but I am nuts over his other three on this album. Unlike many of his other studio recordings, I find that these are most appealing to RHPS fans, as they're full of the attitude and flamboyant sex appeal that attract us to him in Rocky Horror."
4,Some very good tracks,"This CD has become somewhat obsolete, because its main attraction was tracks from the soundtrack of ""Shock Treatment,"" which wasn't available on CD, and the audio of the trailer for ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show.""However, it does still have great appeal for including the 7"" remix of ""Shock Treatment,"" which as far as I know isn't available anywhere else, and also quite a few wonderful recordings from ""Little Nell."" She has the strangest voice you've ever heard, but her songs are electric and fun to listen to. If you like 70's pop fused with a bit of 50's flare, you'd love ""Little Nell's"" songs.The downside to this CD are Tim Curry's tracks. I know it's blasphemy for any RHPS fan to speak against him, but the songs just fall flat. Though he was the breakout star of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" he failed to produce any songs that are even tolerable in the recording studio."
2,So-so read,"This book did not grasp my attention. The plot was too complicated and the heroine and hero just made it worse. How is it possible to be surrounded by Godly people, but not one of them help you when you are down and out. Everyone in the book is a hypocrite and never faces up to their wrongs. I'm glad that the characters made it through the end, but the book never connects from one point to the other. The book was a good effort, but I prefer books with less complicationss"
5,HEAD OVER HEELS,"Stephanie Mittman is a wonderful storytelling, delightful romance writer. HEAD OVER HEELS is inspiring...well written. It keeps you on your toes since it's packed with conflict. She did a great job with this tale of Nan and Harry's story bringing them to a fantastic happy ending. And that's what I want in a book. Don't miss this one! Keep up the good work, Stephanie!"
2,not for everyone,"I bought this book after reading the 5 star reviews above. I found it to be very doom and gloom...panic disorder is torture and this book definitely highlights that...but some of us are on a path to wellness and for me, its through CBT and SSRI's...two things that he knocks in the book. Before you take everything he claims too seriously, educate yourself of the real side effects (positive and negative) of other pharmacological treatments OTHER than BDZ and look at the positive effects of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Here is a link to a great site: [...]PD doesnt have to be debilitating. I understand the need for BDZ sometimes but I dont like how he discounts CBT!Just ok."
4,love my mug,"I love this mug for tea in the morning. i like the shape and sturdiness, and it keeps tea hotter longer. the infuser is only ok, if you dont mind some leaves in your tea, which i do, so i use a bag and put the lid on for steeping. the lid is also a good place to rest your tea bag and spoon.one other downside is that the handle gets a bit hot in the microwave"
4,Good Thriller-Updated Version of Forsyth's 4th Protocol,"I enjoyed reading this-good analysis of life as an intelligence analyst. The plot line is nearly identical to Forsyth's 4th Protocol written 2 decades earlier-MI5 tracking an invisible agent in UK. Only in Rimington's version, KGB has been replaced with Islamic terrorists as the antagonist. And the planned attack is not a dirty bomb and the target much more specific. Still, I enjoyed reading it and plan to keep reading the rest of her work."
4,good debut,"It isn't easy to write a decent spy thriller. The genre itself insists upon a quick turn of events, and adrenaline pumping through reader's veins. Unfortunately the reality of the most of inteligence work is a drab, slow progress that might put anybody to sleep.Stella Rimington has the neccessery qualifications for this tough job, she spent decades working for MI5.The result is a authentic novel with a good plot, reasonably believeable characters, but with some of the expected beginners bumps and lumps.""At Risk"" is a very good debut and the first in a series. I already own three of the others, and will read them soon enough."
4,A Compelling Battle of Wits,"This is not the edge-of-your-seat action-packed thriller that some fans of the genre might expect, nevertheless Rimington grabs the reader's interest and holds it by showing us a much more subtle, and doubtlessly more realistic, form of spycraft. The heroine is not risking her life at every turn; instead she is in a chess match trying to piece together the clues to unravel the terrorists' plot before they can hit their target."
2,It takes talent to write thrillers,"This book is an example of how a good story idea can get ""underutilized"" in the hands of a not-so-talented writer. I bet Frederick Forsyth would turn this story into a red-hot and unputdownable thriller where the pages just turn by themselves. Instead, Stella Rimingtom gave us something that kept me only mildly interested and engaged."
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,Stella Rimington did a sub par job. The ending was expected and boring. The novel was relatively interesting but an ending like it had was most certainly a let down. I regret spending money on the book. I would expect Ms. Rimington to know better than to write something so obviously skewed. She should take a page from Daniel Silva and learn how to set aside personal happenings or wishes from novel worthy ones. It was obvious to me the entire time I was reading the novel who would come out on top. There wasn't even any pretense to the contrary.
5,Cold Dog Soup tastes so good and sounds so living!,"Cold Dog Soup rocks the Blues and Blues the rocks with that ""perfect roughness"" we love the Blues for."
3,"Not a curse, but Singapore Sling's blessing","It can only be speculated what chemicals these guys were on when Singapore Sling recorded this CD, but chances are it was probably the same stuff The Verve took during 'A Storm In Heaven' or Primal Scream popped during 'Screamadelica'. 'Curse Of Singapore Sling' is a whirlwind hallucinatory guitar ride, a vitriolic and mind-altering experience. Just think Jesus And Mary Chain meets Spacemen 3 or a more psychadelic The Raveonettes, all with a touch of fierce psychobilly swagger. Amongst other interesting substances, you can also smell the dust and gas-fumes trailing behind the Harley. You can smell the danger. 'Curse Of Singapore Sling' is great album by another overlooked Swedish band."
4,Good but needs to be retracked,"I think the album tracks better in this order:1 Overdrive2 Nuthin' Ain't Bad3 Midnight4 No Soul Man5 Roadkill6 Overdrive Demomix (not on album, from band's website)7 Listen8 Dirty Water9 Chantisissity10 Heart Of ChromeThe songs are good, but could flow together better to make a continuous sludge of sound instead of one heavy song followed by a slow song as the album is currently tracked. Summer Garden does not fit with the other songs and should have been left off the album. There seems to be a slight twangyness to some of the songs. The new B.R.M.C. is a much harder album, this sounds more like early The Jesus and Mary Chain meets country. Worth getting, though."
2,Fishing Mississippi,This book wasn't what I had expected it to be.The author spends too much time discussing the type of fish andthe waters location and no time on fishing locations on thosewaters. The author concentrates most of the material on lakesand streams of southern Mississippi.Most of the material in this book can be found in the states wildlife dept. fishing guide.
5,OUTSTANDiNG,"Wow! I was just excited when I picked up my copy of How to Become A POkemon Master. I was so impressed i even bought a copy for my kids, Nick and Scott. They fight over it all the time. Just remember to buy one for each of your children."
2,This book was not very helpful,I nomal do not give bad reviews but this book did not help my soon get better at the games or the TCG it a was do not buy
1,Yuck,"This is definitely the worst book ever written about Pokemon, by a considerable margin. The vignettes by young players weren't explicitly awful, if unnecessary -- but it is when Schlesinger attempts to discuss the game in his own words that he sounds, frankly, like a creepy old man. His attempts at ""humor"" -- which show themselves immediately in the introduction -- are absolutely lunatic.I was simultaneously disturbed and insulted when I first read this book as a 12-year-old Pokemon player. Now that the games are of little popular interest, it may actually be worth buying, just to marvel at the miraculous sequence of events that caused Schlesinger to get published. Just don't expect to learn anything substantial about Pokemon."
2,"Wow! These dudes put Vomit Remnants, Septic Pus and Putrid Mucus to Shame!","Ever wondered what it would sound like if you recorded a guy burping into a microphone while behind him a construction crew is trying to break up a solid concrete sidewalk with a jackhammer? Well wonder no longer! Yeah, it IS that good. If you thought the grandaddies of death like Pungent Stench and Puking Urine could never be beat then I'm pleased to tell you that you're mistaken. Formed during May 2005 in Kobe, Kansai, with a starting lineup of Hidenori Sato (lead burper), Kouichi Masuda (electric lawnmower), Masahiro Nagatomo (chainsaw), Shinichi Semba (jackhammer) and Masazumi Mitsuno (drum machine), these guys make our local German favourites like Bile Duct Excretion sound like Justin Bieber. So if you like the sound of breaking wind and jackhammers in a complex three-part harmony, don't waste any more time, and order this now! Just don't forget to order a set of ear plugs too."
2,Awkward,Plant doesn't look as pictured; much more stiff and leaves difficult to position for a more natural look. Long stem makes it out of proportion. Returned for credit.
5,A brilliantly colorful picture book,"The collaborative effort of Tony Porto and the graphic design firm 3CD, Blue Aliens! An Adventure In Color is a brilliantly colorful picture book about a young person's imagination running wild. Could color-eating aliens that suck all the green or blue out of a world really exist? The story is told in narration with color-themed pictures; the mysterious color-eating aliens are never actually depicted --- unless the teacher Mrs. Sapphire is one of them!"
5,SUPREME,it is so nice to get the old songs by my fave girl group..just played it today and so happy groovin' along with the music!!!
3,Action Packed,"This is a typical Mark Roper, fast paced war action flick that keeps you on the edge of yor seat. There's plenty of blood and gore, good Marines and bad Russians. Brant Cottons role as the young Marine leader was dead on. A missed cast black man as the crusty Colonel with a Mike Tyson voice, was the only distraction. All in all a movie worth watching. Semper Fi.."
2,It's your ticket to the Promised Land.,"This CD features Little Richard singing gospel songs, obviously. It is a very disappointing album. The production values are next to nonexistent. Very minimal instrumental support, not very well played. As for Richard himself; he is not the over the top, exhuberant showman from his classic rock and roll songs. Instead, he sings in a restrained, rather boring style. Give this one a pass."
4,Very enjoyable Bordeaux wine book,"Very comprehensive, well ilustreded, historically informed book. For Bordeaux wine lovers find out at this book an good source of informations and knowledge. Salut!"
1,Cheap.,"You could build this for $50.00. Just buy PVC at a hardware store, and bags at Wal-Mart. Sounds like a rip off."
3,Memoirs of an arrogant ass!!,"Having looked at the 3 other online reviews as well as the book cover quote ""Vitally significant and impressive"" I'm starting to wonder if I have just read the same book!This is a very average, not very observant, account of life in the American Embassy in Berlin from 1939 to '41.The author comes across as selfish, rude and a social spastic. His interaction with Germans appears solely for the opportunities of mockery. He gets all the perks of diplomatic life yet is oblivious to the sufferings of the rationed-to-death Germans around him.His rather coarse and nearly laughable portraits of Hitler & co. read today like the crudest propaganda and in hindsight forms the most dated part of the book.How such an unlikeable man came into the field of diplomacy is one of the ironies of this rather self-centred tale."
4,Good Cow Boy Stories,"I found this little gem of a book referenced in a book review of another book! It's been around since the early 1880's and is a splendid read. Not complicated, but very entertaining."
2,Action/Adventure:YES Compelling:NO,"Although his interesting childhood kept you glued to the first quarter of the book, the rest is just a basic cowboy's life written with little or no techniques to keep you compelled to read every word. It is interesting to read, however, since he was a true to life cowboy. If I had to do over, I'd saved my money."
1,Give this guy your money!,"A long, stupid and boring story that you MUST read and memorize at college for quiz tests. I still wonder how studying this most unimportant account of a most unimportant guy is going to help me become a better Mechanical Engineer."
5,The Mystery of Cabin Island,I sent this book to my grandson in Scotland for his eighth birthday. He is thrilled!
3,stiff and glossy,"Got this gift as a sentimental remembrance---we both loved this book as kids. It had the complete original text plus vintage ads in the back for other series--all very nice. The binding was a little stiff and tight. The dustjacket looked cheap--not the best reproduction. Also, I object to the spine of the dustjacket identifying it as a facsimile--that doesn't seem necessary. That being said, the gift worked as a thoughtful piece of nostalgia."
5,very entertaining :),"i loved this book, it has a good set of characters. i can describe everything in this book but that would fill hte whole PAGE!"
4,Who knew?,"My 1 year old son checked this book out of the library with his babysitter, and I have read it no less than 5 times a day ever since. Now it's time to return the book and I'm happy to invest in our own copy, even though it's not something that I would have been drawn to myself. I don't know why my son likes this book so much, but there must be something about the illustrations and the simplicity of the text that really works for him."
1,Not good for people with eating disorders,"I was bulimic, and reading this to my toddler made me feel like stuffing my face again. I gave it away to someone who doesn't have this problem."
2,Not suitable as a guide,"We recommended this to our actors thinking they could use it as a guide to prepare in private before rehearsals start.Oops.This particular show obviously interpreted the original script fairly loosely. The arrangements of about a quarter of the songs are so different from the score that they proved unusable. For these I either had to buy the original songs and edit them on a computer, or played and recorded them on keyboard as per the score.Also, some of the singing reinforces my opinion that most singers can't act and most actors can't sing. Unfortunately our singers have now absorbed the quirks and it's proving difficult to unlearn them.But I can well imagine that, if you were at this particular show, this is a nice memento."
3,Too low power laser and too heavy.,"I feel the aluminum level is much too heavy. Hard to believe it is aluminum and feels heavy as steel. When placed on a steel locker, the magnet will tend to slide down the door when attached by the magnet. This should never, ever happen. This laser is too heavy for it's magnet. The laser brighnest is too low, hence only good for short distances, 20 feet or so. On a flat wall, the beam barely lays out a visible line due to the low intensity (or low angle), and that was a very disappointing criteria for me, since I use it for hanging wall objects. Otherwise, it is very sturdy and good quality as I expected. The ability to rotate the laser beam from vertical to horizontal seems to be well engineered. Regretably, I will return to using a spirit level."
5,It works!,"My 88 year old father-in-law is a severe diabetic. He did not notice the switch from glucerna to glucoburst. He drinks this twice a day inbetween meals and this helps to keep his blood sugar stable. He is under, rather than overweight. Ordering this product is convenient and the best price I have found so far for similar products. I hope the price does not increase!He likes the taste and enjoys drinking it."
4,Makes a difference!,I am a diabetic and have used this for a while to comfortably say it makes a difference. Sometimes it takes a while for a greater difference to emerge. This helped me when needing an assist with lower glucose. The flavor was VERY good for me..if you like ensure or Glucerna then you will have not issues with this product'a taste. I chose chocolate and felt guilty at first but it is great!
1,A different opinion,"I have to rate this film extra low to inject a little reason into this ridiculously high (at this time, four stars!) rating it has here.It is not even up to the standards of an ABC after-school special.My main complaint, after the premise, the script, and the b-acting, is the music rising and drowning out the most crucial dialog...again and again.Somewhere there are people embarrassed by this movie, and others who should be.Life is short, don't waste your time."
3,It's an OK Film,"This movie is moderately entertaining. It is definitely B-movie quality. There is some bad acting, over-acting, and the writing is what you would expect for a B-production. I noticed a lot of exuberant reviews. I think these folks are giving the film too much praise. It is a solid 2.5-3. Your average film that will entertain, but not impress."
2,Trying too hard...,"I, like many of the other reviewers, had high hopes when I bought this book. Ultimately it felt contrived. As though he wanted to use every idea he ever had for a clever turn of phrase in one book. Sometimes I could only roll my eyes as I was reading some of the metaphors. I didn't care about Gloria. In the end her character didn't make sense anymore and I was just glad I had finished reading the book so that I could read another perhaps more interesting and satisfying one."
2,Kind of dull...,"I have never read any books by Jonathan and Faye Kellerman, so I did not buy this book with any pre-conceived expectations. I saw it in a bookstore, thought it had an interesting premise and decided to give it a chance.It's not that this book is badly written. In fact, there is really nothing wrong with the writing persay. It's just that there is a whole lot of nothing going on in this book until about the last 60 or 70 pages, and at that point it's as if a set of different characters had entered the story to take the place of the previous characters. Mild mannered Gloria becomes gun-toting bad mama. Not a bad story, but not a good one either.I will give the Kellerman's next book a try (that too looks like an interesting premise.) Let's hope it's not as disappointing as this one."
1,Couldn't get through it.,"Gloria Mendez has worked for, and been in love with, her boss, Carl Perreira for ten years. Gloria receives an unintelligible message from Carl, who is on vacation in Mexico. When she tries to find him, she learns he was killed in a car accident. As Gloria tries to find out more about Carl, but the more she learns the more she finds he was not who he seemed.I like books that are character driven, but the characters needs to be interesting and the story needs to compelling enough that I want to keep reading. Both these aspects were missing here. It wasn't terrible and I could have kept going, but finally, at page 112, I found myself wondering why I wasting time with this book. My overall reaction was that I really didn't care what happened and that's when I put the book down. I'd rather spend my time with a book that makes me need to read it."
5,Awesome!,"Jesse Kellerman delivers a debut as close to flawless as I've seen in a long time -- perhaps not since the first Lisa Scottoline, Everywhere that Mary Went.Three-dimensional characters.Plot twists that actually take you by surprise but that seem logical and connected.Clues for the reader as well as the characters (he plays fair).Scenes vividly described .No loose ends left hangingSmooth writing that keeps pages turningA chronology that's easy to followWhat more do we want?The supporting characters -- Gloria's best friend, Gloria's ex-husband and the LA detectives -- were somewhat sketchy. But that's okay: they're in background.I had no trouble believing the characters or the plot. And I wish I'd had this novel last week, for a long plane ride. It's been awhile since I could get so caught up in a story.So...what's next from this author? I'm waiting."
2,"Rated ""B"" for boring","Not good. Just not good at all. The shame of it is that the plot had real promise, but the story unfolded poorly and I ended up not rooting for ANY of the characters, to include the protagonist. Don't bother with this book."
2,"Hope he gets plotting and pacing down, because he knows characters and dialogue ...","I gave him another chance (read Trouble first), and I'll admit, the guy has some writing chops. His characters are vivid, his dialogue is entertaining, but his pacing is awful and while his plots are decent, their execution is less than desirable. 50 pages of meh with 3 pages of fun is not a novel that keeps my attention."
2,"More Kellermans! Disappointed, adopted?","I bought SUNSTROKE with exciting anticipation - I love the writing of Jesse's parents! I don't know the genre of young Kellerman's novel; but it's not a thriller. It's a ""ho-hummer""!Pick any 2 or 3 pages at random and you'll agree the writing style is quite good. Perhaps the family name misled me; but gradually it became b.o.r.i.n.g. I read to the last page, ever hopeful, but at last disappointed. I noticed the reviews tend to be 1 star or 5 stars; I do not have the literary insight (or pretensions?) of the latter 5 star constellation. No more Jesse.I did appreciate the Acknowledgment to his mother, Megillah 15a."
5,"Deep, engrossing, unconventional thriller!","""Sunstroke"" is a terrific book that doesn't easily fit in any category. Sure, the conventional pulp thriller is a fine genre, and Jesse Kellerman could have (very) easily decided that he wanted to adhere to all its conventions and become its newest scion. Instead, he took a risk and created, ""Sunstroke,"" which - like a wolf in sheep's clothing - comes in the guise of a thriller but ends up much deeper, more haunting, and ultimately far more satisfying than virtually anything I've read in the thriller space. Much like the Coen Brother's film ""Fargo,"" Kellerman will toy with the standard levers of crime fiction to produce a page-turner, but to a much higher end. Writing is vivid and often hysterically funny, but it's the perfectly drawn heroine Gloria Mendez and the erie themes relating to our tragically limited knowledge of people we love that will linger for a very long time. Bravo, Jesse Kellerman!!"
4,Good first novel,"I enjoyed this novel very much. Really couldn't put it down--it was fast reading. I didn't see the ending coming. I do agree with one reviewer, in that it is a ""book noir"". Looking forward to his second read."
2,"What's it all about, Alfie?","I read this one clear through but wish I hadn't. It gave me heat fatigue! The idea of searching for a lost ""love"" in the wilds of Mexico sounded interesting but, in spite of good stuff here and there, it was a long dry walk in the desert. The characters didn't make sense or help the plot. The ending was a real letdown and pissed me off.[SPOILER] What amazed me the most was that this lady spends the first half of the book crying in her beer over her lost love object. Then when she's given his ashes and they turn out to be instant coffee, she shrugs and that's the end of it. Isn't she curious? Sure, she asks el Teniente. He says he don't know nothing 'bout no stinking coffee--and that's it!!"
1,don't bother,"First off, I agree with the other reviewer that the type was way too small. I was glad to read his comments regarding the difficulty of reading this tiny type, because I thought my eyes were going bad.This book did not grab my interest, at all. I kept reading, thinking, its got to get better, but it dragged on. I didn't think the characters were at all interesting and the unending background information about the main character's (Gloria)life was unnecessary and boring (page fillers at best). It was not an exciting or believeable book and left me thinking ""who cares?"" I'm not sure why I even finished it, just wanted to get it over with so I could start a more interesting one. Maybe the author inherited some other talent or trait from his parents, but it wasn't writting thrillers."
4,A pleasant surprise,"I picked up this book at a thrift store and then read some of the reviews prior to reading it. Let's just say my expectations were low based on some of the recent reviews, but I gave it a shot. I actually thought it was really good. At first I thought it was going to be predictable but it didn't turn out the way I expected it. It wasn't a 'thriller' in the sense that it kept me on the edge of my seat in suspense, but it definitely took some twists and turns and kept me guessing. I don't want to give the plot twist away, but I would say give it a chance, it gets better as it goes along."
2,D.isappointed,"I loved Jesse Kellerman's book ""The Genius"" but could not warm up to ""Sunstroke"". I think that Kellerman is very talented and I will continue to read his books."
4,Hawkwind - 'Live 1974: Live At Chicago Auditorium' (EMI),"A one-disc version of the Hawkwind - '1999 Party' 2-CD import that EMI had released - over ten years ago now. Good sound mix. It's always good to hear these space rock merchants perform such gems as ""Brainbox Pollution"", the stunning ""You Know You're Only Dreaming"", ""You'd Better Believe It"" (Simon House's violin playing really shines - particularly on this track), ""Master Of The Universe"" and ""Welcome To The Future"". I know several patrons that saw Hawkwind on this actual tour here in the U.S. Nice pick, but still pretty much aimed toward the die-hard fans."
4,Good read...,"Definitely gives a different perspective on getting through to your man. Men and women think, talk and process things differently. This book helps to hone communication skills not only with your mate but also with your kids. Saying it so he'll listen really gets their attention."
5,Unbelievable!!!! Everysong gets you pumped.,"This cd was referred to me by a friend who lives in Sicily(Italy). Many of these songs are played in the Italian Dance club scene. I myself don't speak a word, but with this cd it doesn't matter. The other cd's by 883 are regular rock and roll, but the remix cd is all dance. Best dance cd I have."
1,Disturbingly False,"This book is written by a Canadian who watches too much CNN and Fox in determining the strengths and weaknesses of the American Government. However, he does poke fun at the American people by saying that, ""Americans think that they represent the world by large. The only truth to this is they represent it by being large and fat."" Does Hodge mean by the American people's wallets or waist size? It is too unclear. Besides that, this book does list in order some of the American presidents which is a good thing."
5,Never knew gardening could be such an adventure!,"I laughed, I cried, I got poison ivy...the experience was so real. I read this book in one sitting and decided right them and there that I'd plant my first garden! Following David's narrative was a lot of fun...following his advice may be a lot of work, but I know I won't regret it. (I'm giving two copies of this book as gifts to my garden-growing friends.)"
3,Wonderful band------ Poor DVD!!!!,"BLACK OAK ARKANSAS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL BANDS OF ALL TIME, HOWEVER THIS DVD DOES NOT DO THEM ANY JUSTICE.THE SOUND QUALITY IS TERRIBLE AND THERE ARE NO CAPTIONS TO HELP US DISTINGUISH THE SONG LYRICS.IF YOU'RE A FAN OF THE BAND AS I AM, YOU'LL BE BETTER OFF LISTENING TO THE CD'S INSTEAD.ALTHOUGH WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED FROM AGED MATERIAL ANYWAY?THE FOOTAGE IS QUITE OLD AND THEREFORE THE SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT.MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS ON THE DVD AND SEE THEM LIVE INSTEAD!!!"
5,Incredible Musicianship,"Scott is the best crazy-amazing guitarist you've probably never heard of. I'm a fan of complex, melodic, techically incredible guitar playing--think Greg Howe, John Petrucci (Dream Theater), Vinnie Moore, Blues Saraceno, etc., and without a doubt Scott hangs with these guys. He's incredibly talented, both technically and compositionally.I learned about Scott by taking guitar lessons from him in Scottsdale, AZ. Although I was a fairly advanced player, after hearing him play, I wanted to give him my guitar. Hearing his own material made me really respect his abilities as a composer and musician. If you like amazing guitar work and jazz/rock fusion, you'll love this disc."
2,Clumpy and smudges easily,"I found this product to be very clumpy and gloopy and smudge. I can't understand why this mascara would smudge without being rubbed or getting wet but it does. I also have to wipe off the brush of all the excess before I can use it. Good price but I would be willing to pay more for a better product. Compared side by side with my Clinique mascara, this product doesn't perform nearly as well."
3,Wouldn't buy again,"It is thick and clumpy when taking the wand out of the tube. You even have to wipe off the clumps before applying. Then while you are wearing it, it smudges. Not worth buying again."
5,I laughed until I fell off my chair. Perfect gift.,This is a perfect gift to take to someone in the hospital or recovering or someone who just needs a lift.
5,They really all make sense,"One of my favorite Yogi-isms isn't from any of these books--it appeared in an insurance commercial he starred in, where he remarks that the policy they sell has this feature: ""If you get hurt and miss work, it doesn't hurt to miss work."" Everybody in the barber shop where he is at the time goes ""huh?"" If I'd been one of those customers, I wouldn't have had that reaction."
4,FUNNY,IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED. I THINK WE ALL GET A CHARGE OUT OF PEOPLE MAKING FUN OF THEMSELVES. IT WAS A GIFT MEANT TO BE HUMOROUS...AND IT WAS JUST THAT.
4,fun from a simpler era,"You always hear yogiisms pop up like ""you can observe a lot by watching"" - they combine homespun wisdom, unique humor, and gramatical error. In this book, Yogi puts it all together in a wonderful excursion into his life and mind, and the result is very very fun and funny. He is really from a less cynical time, when it was easier to believe in heros and you could take things more at face value. I love this book and have perused it many times for a chuckle as well as a good quote to post around the office. Great gift book."
4,Short but funny with some ponderables,"This small book contains many of Yogi Berra's humorous, and sometimes thought-provoking, statements. I added over 30 to my quotes collection. He explains how many originated and that he did not say some of the sayings attributed to him (p. 9: I really didn't say everything I said). Quite a few of them have been quoted so often as to have become part of our culture:p. 30: It's dèja vu all over again!p. 95: You can learn a lot by watching.p. 118: The future ain't what it used to be.But some were new to me:p. 64: It gets late early out here.p. 73: Always go to other people's funerals, otherwise they won't go to yours.p. 93: Never answer an anonymous letter.Finally, Yogi's family contributed some of their own:p. 125: Tim-I knew exactly where it was, I just couldn't find it.p. 125: Betsy-Sometimes you have to get lost to find yourself.p. 125: Mario-I've double checked it six times."
1,An overpriced comic book,There's not much to criticize here because there can't be any more than 500 words in the whole book. The rest is padded with photos from the good old days. What is written is not very funny and has been heard before. I rate this as a waste of time even if it was only 20 minutes.
1,A BIG ZERO!,An amazingly empty book. Just a few quotes we've all heard a thousand times before. I think Yogi was a wonderful player. But this lightweight book certainly isn't worth owning.
2,"Enjoy the read, but don't take this book as historical fact","Yogi really DIDN'T say everything that's attributed to him. A whole cottage industry for sports writers has sprung up inventing way too clever stuff and putting it in Yogi's mouth.Unfortunately, it may be too late to correct the record. How can Yogi disown such gems as ""It's deja vu all over again"" when everybody WANTS to believe he said it?In the early 1980's I read an interview with Berra in which a journalist walked him through the fifty best known Berraisms, and Yogi disowned about half of them. Included in the spurious Berraisms was the world-renowned ""It's deja vu all over again.""Sorry to be a spoilsport, but let's have a little truth here. Does anyone seriously believe that during his playing days this guy, who had such a shaky command of basic English, had the French expession ""deja vu"" in his word stock to draw upon when needed?"
5,Perfect Gift,"There is no better gift for a devout Yankee fan. Ninety percent of the quotes you know, the other half you don't, to paraphrase Lawrence Peter Berra. The pictures are great. Yogi's comments and the perspectives he offers are hilarious. Buy it!!"
1,Terrible,"I highly recommend you do NOT buy this DVD. I bought it off of Amazon and couldn't wait to get it, and it was a huge disappointment. First of all, the band doesn't have anything to say in this. It's all ""friends"" of the band who knew them back in the early days. The commentary sucks, some lady with a British accent that can't say Mustaine. There is no Metallica music in this DVD because it wasn't ok'd by Metallica or the label so the music is a bunch of depressing, immitation metal. I am a very loyal Metallica fan and own tons of Metallica DVDs that are worth having. Like Year in the Half in the life of..and Cliff 'Em All. This is just a waste of money. The only thing good about it is it says Metallica on it in my DVD rack."
2,No new information,This dvd is the same old information we have known about the band for ages now. None of the dvd had the band members on it. It was a huge waste of money unless you are a new Metallica fan and know nothing about them. Skip this dvd if you are looking for something with the band members on it.
5,"Finally, a collection of the work of a true modern master","This is a book which is long overdue... I was introduced to the work of Oscar Chichoni via the covers he created for or were reprinted by, Heavy Metal magazine in the US, and have until now had a very hard time finding anything else on this amazing artist. My only complaint about this book, is that it is far too brief, although its content is excellent, with many full page color illustrations and several excellent preliminary pencil sketches. I highly recommend this book to any fans of fantasy artists such as Royo, Sorayama and Simon Bisley. Chichoni is an unsurpassed master of the use of texture, and his work would be great inspiration to any student or even professional artist."
5,Powerfull Eric Burdon!!!,"This is an authentic Rock'n Roll album,with great performance of this ""Monster""! Eric Burdon's music is of great energy specially some tracks like ""Leo's Place""!!!This is music that goes directly to our vain...directly to our soul.Just put the earphones,hit the level of the sound....and what delicious music!!!!!!"
3,Not good for gaming...,Connects well& easy to use but it cant hold a sold connections for over a hour..It drops & reconnects every 20-50 minuets. That's enough to kick you out of game or disconnect from Steam. This usb N card is no good! Don't try & save money like I did & just pay the extra $15 for a good N card.
2,good...not excellent,....I couldn't connected to my Linux computer..... :(....On windows works fine. nothing extraordinary
5,Even my mom could install it,Ordered this adapter from Amazon and had it shipped to my mom about a month ago. Talked her through the installation. Asked her about it recently and she said it's working just fine.
3,Inexpensive but problematic,"The price and overall connectivity of this Zonet is fair; my complain is with its strange tendency to stop communicating with a wireless router when another USB device is disconnected from the computer. It happens EVERY time when a device, be it a USB flash or a hard drive, is disconnected by simply yanking the USB cord out, and very frequently when the disconnection is done utilizing 'Remove USB device' icon. No other - and I've had many - wireless network adapter has ever done so on my computer. It, therefore, creates enough of inconvenience to earn only three stars.I also wonder if anyone has had a similar issue and if there is a way to correct it. Thanks."
4,Unit is still kicking....,and will likely to be used on some Windows 7 box down the line with WPA2.Use the drivers from here:http://www.ralinktech.com/ralink/Home/Support/Windows.htmlas the Zonet drivers haven't been updated since '07.
3,Not bad for the price,"The only issue I have with this product is it will drop connection from time to time. However when it has a connection, its strong and performs really well.My best test case was using it while playing World of Warcraft. My lag would be low, but at times I would have major lag where I was unable to do anything and I took a look at the Zonet monitor and it dropped the connection, but would then reconnect.It's possible I have a defective unit. The reason I purchased this unit was due to other user reviews saying how much they liked it. I am not sure if they were gaming while using this product, but that's why I wanted to share my experience with everyone."
5,The Little Top Gun,"Easy Setup, easy connection, no drop outs, great range ... I must have been the last one in the neighborhood to get hi speed because the whole neighborhood is available. Have not found a complaint yet. I am happy with my Zonet. Russ"
5,This is a great adapter!,"I needed a new wireless adapter because my old pci adapter wouldn't work with Windows x64. This small wonder worked great right out of the box, though I do recommend downloading the latest drivers. I've been using it for about a month now, and I haven't had a single problem with it. Highly recommended!"
2,Raylan Givens portrayal hideous,"Peter Falk is great as the bookie being hunted by the mob. The casting for the Raylan Givens character (it's not T. Olyphant who does it wonderfully) is awful. Givens is portrayed as a country bumpkin idiot who can shoot. Boring and actually hard to watch. However, as mentioned above, Falk is a delight."
5,No reservations Peru,I enjoy anything done by Anthony Boudain who is a great entertainer with a wonderful sense of humor
1,Not too pleased.,The whine of the woman's voice grates on my nerves. Is she supposed to be singing? Not a pleasant sound.
5,Absolute bliss!!!,"I've got quite a few albums, and many of Djavan's albums, but this one is definitely close to the top!!! The tune 'Meu' is probably one of my favorite songs of all I know (and that's saying a lot). This album is for people who love great music, and not just the regular commercial stuff. If you love arrangements, you can listen to each instrument at each time you listen and you'll be inspired. By the way, I am Brazilian and I have a vast knowledge of Brazilian music and this is stuff I'm proud of and can share with anyone I meet. Thanks, Djavan!"
2,Don't bother with this one,"A MUCH better book is Toni Weschler's ""Taking Charge of your Fertility"". ""Fertility Awareness Handbook"" provides far less useful information. While it gives a general overview of reproduction and fertility signs, it doesn't provide truly useful information on how to use FAM to avoid or achieve pregnancy. I am someone who is trying to achieve pregnancy, and I found this book's single page on ""how to get pregnant"" a joke. I agree with the previous reviewer, this book basically tells you ""you can get pregnant anytime""."
4,Great Watch Plagued By Fragile Clasp,"As you can see, this is a great-looking watch. It is very comfortable and light weight. However, the clasp is fragile and woefully inadequate. After owning the watch for only year with no hard use, the clasp broke. Paid nearly $30 (US) for replacement. Within 6 months of use (being very careful to avoid recurrent breakage), it broke again. Would expect far better for a $375 retail titanium watch (or anything from Seiko).Only other complaint is that date function is inconvenient to adjust for each month that contains fewer than 31 days (and make sure you don't go a day too far or you have to spin forward through 30 days!).A very attractive watch that generally works well, but with an expensive weak link!"
2,Great watch with fatal flaw,I love everything about this watch except that the band is literally the weak link. It broke weeks after buying it. Look for another watch with a strong band.
3,Not the color we wanted,"We thought this watch would be a nice titanium color (charcoal grey) with gold highlights. It is not as appears from the photo. The watch is just a standard silver/gold. Nice watch, but not the color we wanted. We returned it so can't comment on its working quality."
2,Not for Vista at this time,"That is what I was told by a service tech, after I purchased the unit, and after I spent many hours trying to get the product to work. It's not mentioned anywhere in the product information either."
1,bad equipment,The cd it came with was blank.The instruction were a reduced copy the size of business card.
1,**DO NOT BUY THIS!!!*,"I bought this before reading reviews. After I made my purchase, the reviews scared me then I thought, oh well, this is just a select few who had issues. NO! They were spot on! Unit apparently comes from a teenager who lives with parents trying to rip people off! Generic CD (""RiDATA""), from Wal-Mart, no labels, etc. and something that Windows simply cannot recognize on not one but THREE (3) different machines! Plugged the actual unit into all 3 machines, same error message: ""A USB unit has exceeded it power limits of the port hub."" ...and that's just the barebones unit plugged in with NOTHING attached!!Need I say more?"
4,What is between josekis and empty board,"Very good information about the first few moves of the Go game. Principles are gone through one by one and are enligtened by analysis of example games. At the end of the book is ten problems in format where is not only sole right answer, but indication of how good 20 or so best choices as the problem answer are on scale up to 10 points. This book is fast to read unlike many other books in this serie. Only down side was the fact that this book doesn't make the reader comprehend the early game presicely, but that is more due the nature of the early game than fault of this book."
2,Difficult to get into & deflated after 3 months,"The concept is great - lumbar support for your hard-working back during the first few months with your baby. However, stepping into the boppy at night while holding your baby - or before picking baby up - is a balancing challenge. So, I took off the back pillow attachment after a few weeks. The pillow itself then doesn't compete with the softness of non-inflatable boppies. Last, but not least, about a week ago (2 1/2 months after starting to use it) it started leaking air so I have to blow it up every day now until I can find the time to find the hole and put duct tape on the hole. My recommendation - go with a traditional boppy."
3,Catholic History,The author is frank in his introduction. His subject is the Catholic side of the nine years war. Perhaps he is right that the story needs to be heard. Still the loaded words thru out the book bother me. The Protestants are vilified and the Catholics glorified.
5,A great mix of songs by terrific female artists!,"This two-disc compilation is an excellent introduction to a broad range of talented female singers. Ranging from popular artists such as Sarah McLachlan and Sinead O'Connor to (in the States, at least) lesser-known singers like Kate Rusby and Thea Gilmore, the discs offer a variety of sounds - from pop to folk to blues, and back again.If you enjoy Songbirds, you may also enjoy albums by the artists represented and other similar singers. Check out some of the following:""10"" - Kate Rusby""Daybreaker"" - Beth Orton""Sleepy Little Sailor"" - Oh Susanna""Rules for Jokers"" - Thea Gilmore""Tropical Brainstorm"" - Kirsty MacColl""Be Here Now"" - Suzanne Little (not featured on discs)""Heroine"" - Wild Strawberries (not featured)""Trigger Fables"" - Taste of Joy (not featured)""Silence"" - Tara MacLean (not featured)"
4,Very Nice Compilation,"This is a very good double CD. The sound quality and volume consistency are very, very good. (No need to raise or lower from track to track). Also, the songs flow well from track to track; obviously a lot of effort was taken on this. I just wish that some heavy hitters (Joni, Carly) were included. Eva Cassidy's take on Simon & Garfunkel's ""Kathy's Song"" is outstanding. Check out Philo records compilations (Philo So Far, Singers & Songwriters) as well!"
3,money clip,"O.K. clip for the money. In retrospect wish I would have spent a bit more as it was a bit on the cheap side. However, I wasn't expecting much for the price so I got what I paid for."
2,Good for a Few Months,"Based on reviews I brought this item in late August. It worked like a charm early, but the quality of the material started to show after a few months. It started losing its ability to clip my cards and money. Finally the metal cracked and broke. A money clip is something a guy should have for a long time, like a watch. Skip this product and invest in material that will last years NOT months."
4,Nice inexpensive replacement,"Looks good. Not the finest quality but just as good as any $15 to $20 clip. I've been using it every weekend for the past 2 months and it's still holding up quite well. Again, I only use it on the weekends. I only carry 2 ID's, one credit card and a $20."
2,not what I expected,I think I should have gotten his first book first. This book keeps referring to it. Complicated recipes too.
2,Great if you like Tofu!,The book looks great on the outside however many of the recipes are vegan style or tofu related.
3,real age cookbook,"I have tried some of the recipes in this book and were good, but most of the recipes are not something I would fix on a daily basis because of time and lack of every day ingredients. This cookbook is for the serious dieters that have more time than I do."
3,Good but not what I thought it would be,It had information that I wasn't expecting that was good but things I knew as a nutritionist. I was disappointed that it didn't have more recipes. That was why I had purchased the book.
1,Revise the book for ease of use.,"After fumbling through this book to read the recipes, I realized I will probably not use it again. The layout is so cumbersome that recipes you think you remember hide within and require too, too much page flipping. The recipes are also pretty basic, which may be fine for novice chefs. But, are nothing new to anyone who has been cooking nutricious food for many years."
4,great book great recipes,"good book, good recipes, i liked it ,it was practical nothing over the top .. for a get healthy book itis a good book"
2,"liked the book, not the cover","It took longer than expected to receive this book and when I did get it, it was obviously damaged. I was not happy. It was described as new, and it looked used."
2,Not nearly enough recipes,"I love Dr. Roizen, and Dr. Oz, who both have appeared on Oprah many times. Their not about fad diets, etc., but just eating right. I was dissapointed with this book, though. I thought I was getting a cookbook, and instead it was 3/4 reading and 1/4 recipes. I thought it was hard to follow. ""You"" The owners Manual is a much better book to read, which was written by both Dr. Roizen and Dr. Oz."
2,Repeat of information from other books,"If you think you are buying a book with over 300 pages of recipes, save your money. Over 2/3 of the book is repeat advice about how to eat the ""real age way"". Along with this repeated information from Dr. Roizen's previous Real Age books is ""silly"" advice ranging from what kitchen utensils will increase your kitchen IQ along with how and when to buy produce."
2,Cooking the RealAge Way:,"i look forward to any new publications from dr oz and dr roizen, but i was disappointed in this book.....too much repeat information..."
1,Buyer Beware,"4/8/10 - I bought this Golf Guard case in December of 2009. It has four clasps. One of the clasps didn't make it through the first flight in January on Delta...it literally got ripped off. I've now traveled with it several times and I'm down to 2 remaining clasps. Last night on the luggage carousel, only one of the remaining clasps was holding it closed. Today I had to ask the TSA to tape the bag closed. It's a shame...every other feature of this bag is as advertised...I really like the case... but the cheap clasps are a critical design flaw. I'd recommend you spend a little more money on a sturdier case."
2,First time with Borges,"This is the first time I read J.L. Borges. The stories, somehow disturb me. Some are confusing, but all of them attract the reader because the are so well written and are full of memorable sentences. If you want to have a reference in latinamerican narrative you have to read Borges."
5,"""...probably the most discussed and analyzed narrative in Latin American literature.""","Jose Luis Borges has four works highlighted in ""The New Essential Guide to Spanish Reading"" published by America Reads Spanish, a campaign aimed to increase the use and reading of the Spanish language through the thousands of libraries, schools and book stores in the US. El Aleph is perhaps the best-known. As reviewed in the guide, ""Among the unparalleled volumes of stories by Borges, perhaps none is as well-known as this one. The title story is probably the most discussed and analyzed narrative in Latin American literature."""
4,entertaining BS,"This is a collection of short stories by the renowned Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges. They reflect his penchant for mystico/philosophical musings, literary allusions, and historical references. They are entertaining, sometimes shocking, sometimes amusing, well-written......and in the opinion of a hard-core materialist/realist (myself), BS. Still, they're a fun read. I withhold one star because of the BS factor.P.S. Maybe the BS factor is why he never won the Nobel Prize?"
3,absolutely a must BUT SHARP edges,"for expresso lovers, having a expresso machine at home. this product produces max. foam (plz. read my review on expresso caprisso to know how to achieve max.foam)The design is very, very scientific. I tried a similar height and volume cup; but got bad results.The BAD part : The edges are very sharp, while cleaning with hands, be VERY, VERY careful. You might end up cutting yourself !! I take away a whole 2 stars because of this suffered twice."
2,Another useless kitchen item,"When I bought a new cappucino machine, I decided to buy a metal frothing pitcher to accompany it. Until then, I had always used a pyrex 1-cup measuring pitcher to froth my milk. To my dismay, the pyrex pitcher works much better. Save your money on this item and, if you do not already have one, purchase a pyrex measuring pitcher. Unlike this product, the pyrex has MULTIPLE uses."
3,"Nice Item, Nasty Design Flaw","I was pretty happy with my purchase for a week or so, until the morning I cut my finger open on therazor-sharp lip of the pitcher.. I hadn't realized it was so sharp, until I accidentally ran my fingeracross it the wrong way, and owwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!Was it really necessary for KRUPs to make this with a super sharp rim ?Will have to see if I can buffer the steel edge out a little bit without ruining it."
4,great product,Well the reason I ordered this product was because the other steam piture I ordered was too tall to fit under my machines steam wand.
2,Frothing Pitcher,"I am not crazy about this pitcher. I bought it to use at my folks house when I visit them so I can have lattes and not drive a million miles to get one.The volume is all the in width, not the depth so it is hard to use without rotating the whole thing during steaming and frothing. The rim hits the espresso machine and the wand on the one I used doesn't move so it's limiting and awkward.I'm only not returning it because I will only use it 2-3 times a year."
3,MADE IN CHINA -- FLIMSY FEELING HANDLE,"Yes, it's cheap and 20oz. is a good size. But, the handle is thin and probably feels more flimsy than it is, but that feeling and shape makes it awkward to hold, at least for me.Also, since online retailers like Amazon like to avoid mentioning country of origin for obvious reasons, let me share that this item, like many made by Krups, is made in China. This might be an issue for you if you care about avoiding support of regimes that have records of human rights abuses."
5,Frothing Pitcher,"This is the perfect size for frothing milk. I use it for capuccinos, hot chocolate and more."
5,Frothing Pitcher,"This is a must have item for expert latte and cappucinno. I have tried other pots, and nothing works better than the Krups Frothing Pitcher. Cost me 3 trips to Bed Bath and Beyond before I finally broke down and bought the Krups Frothing Pitcher. Now I make the BEST Cappucinnos and Lattes. Oh yea. Sure makes a difference having the right stuff. ThanksSincerely, Harley"
4,Bigger not better?,"I bought this Krups frothing pitcher along with a Gaggia espresso machine. It's stainless, very attractive - and big. For my uses, it turns out to be too wide and too tall. I never heat/froth 20 oz. of milk or even close. Usually only a cup, 8 oz. or less. With this pitcher I find I have to tilt it in order to get the frothing wand beneath the surface. I've even used a 1 cup stainless steel measuring cup instead of the Krups because of the size. In itself, this pitcher is probably a 5-star item; for me and my personal use, I have to subtract a star. Reminds me of the story of the stork who was given a saucer to drink from - and a bulldog (I think?) who was provided with a tall slim glass... See what I'm saying?"
4,nice large pitcher,This is a great pitcher to use when making more than one latte. Its large size keeps the foam from overflowing. Remember not to fill more than 1/2 way up.
3,The filters work...,The odor eliminator does work in small places such as the bathroom or a closet. It's quiet and the filter has lasted for 6 months.
4,Really works,These filters help clear out the smell of smoke from my neighbors. My neighbors smoke so much the smell comes through my filters and these really help. My only concern is they don't fit in the one intended to stand alone on the floor.
2,Hamilton Beach True Air Replacement Filter,"These came with the air filter itself or I would not have bothered to purchase them.I really didn't notice any difference at all when I used the filter.....I purchased it for an occasional smoker and his (clean, but still) dogs. Not worth my money."
4,A Good CD!!,A Great compilation by BSB. This edition is SO MUCH better than the US one because this one has like a million new remixes & a few new songs + a major enhanced video section. But the worst thing is that some of their songs are really cheesy. Those songs shouldnt have been in this CD in the first place...! Well - Great Cd and buy this one instead of the US one cause this is so much better!
1,Poor chrome,Bar started rusting one the day it was installed. I do not recommend this item unless you plan on painting it.
4,Works just like it should,"I used this with a banana seat on my daughter's 20"" bike. It fit perfect. With the extra holes, I appears it should work on 24"" bikes too. I would guess it may work on 26"" bikes also but only if the seat is set very, very low.Anyway, it seems well made, looks good, and bolted right up with no problems."
5,A Yoga vid that kids love,"With three kids ranging from 3-7, I can easily say that this is the first video my kids watched and participated in from beginning to end. Shana Banana's ability to co-mingle music with yoga brings a whole new dimension to the art. Both instructive and entertaining a must for every parent's collection."
1,Shana Banana Yoga,"I ordered this for my kindergarten classroom, we were so disappointed. It was hokey and did not keep the children's attention. We had just finished Yoga Fitness (which they loved)! They said ""Please lets go back to the the old one"".I would NOT recommend this Video."
5,Amazing book! A must read!,"This book is about two best friends (Nemi and Becky) who are in High school. When they both ""fall in love"" , the term used lightly, with a pair of siblings, they scheme of how to get them together. When they acheive their plan however, they find out that it's not really what they want. It is very well written and I suggest all of you out there ages 12 - 19 read it."
5,Pep in a bottle!,I love this stuff!! Gives me a little boost! Only thing that is annoying is the way the mouth of the bottle is shaped causes it to drip when you pour.
5,excellent dictionary,"Since I've been majoring in Spanish literture for more than five years, I've been using so many diffenent kinds of dictionaries to compare and understand the right meaning of the words and the expressions. Now I just can say Webster's was the best. The contents are imcomparable. It's just excellent. The only thing I want to say is the paper. This is the third time that i bought this dictionary. The copy falls aparts easily I think(or maybe it's just because of my habit) Anyway for average users webster's will give all the answers. (and Spanish doesn't need pronounciation signs)"
4,Great Dictionary,"This is a great dictionary. It provides common idiomatic usage along with the definition, which is always helpful. The only time I've had trouble finding a definition was when I needed something a bit more colloquial."
5,i have to agree,"This is the best Spanish language dictionary I've come across thus far. I've had my copy since high school. It's almost eight years-old and well-used. I usually find what I'm looking for in this dictionary and sometimes it's just fun to read entires randomly, there's so much to learn. But like another reviewer, I must complain about the physical condition - the binding is not that great. I've had to tape mine back together, but alas - it has come undone again. Nevertheless, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Webster's New World Spanish Dictionary as an essential resource. If this is only the concise edition, I'd love to get my hands on an unabridged version! But hopefully, with better binding... :)"
5,Perfect,"Well, almost. The flaws posted in other reviews are credible but not as important as the utility of this book! The number of words and word uses is surprising. The book's size makes it easy to use, the pages never yellow, and the type is easy to read. The USPS lost mine in the mail, is there an updated version?"
1,I'm sorry I bought it!,I'm really sorry I bought this book for my son. It doesn't even have any of the pronounciations for the Spanish words in the first half of the book! I can't understand how anyone could rate this book highly when even the cheapest pocket dictionaries have pronounciations. This is the first time that Amazon readers' comments have led me very much astray!
1,No Spanish pronunciation,"While this is a substantial dictionary for such a low price, I was quite disappointed to find that it doesn't include pronunciation for each Spanish word (it does for the English entries). One could make the point that Spanish pronunciation follows consistent rules and that therefore a pronunciation guide is not needed for each word, but think about how many people are going to see the word ""viejo"" and pronounce it ""vee-ay-hoe"" instead of ""vyeh-kho."" I'm sorry I bought this dictionary."
1,pathetic,"I bought this on other reviewers' recommendations. Are they blind?This is pathetic. Two examples.1. English word--'often' gives the Spanish equivelent 'muchas veces'. Look up 'vece' on the Spanish side, it is not there. What does veces mean? The dictionary does not seem to know, and I don't either.2. Spanish word 'hay' used at the beginning of a sentence. Says it is part of the tenses of haber. Does not mention that it means 'there is' or 'there are' at the beginning of a sentence.I could continue but these two examples should surfice. The book isn't worth the paper it is printed on in my opinion."
4,Almost perfect,"I received this replacement carafe less than a week after ordering. I would have said the order was perfect if it had been exactly like the original carafe. However, the central raised area of the lid was just a bit too tall for our machine. Fortunately we still have the old lid to our broken carafe, and it fits the new carafe just fine, so all worked out OK."
3,Coffee Pot Replacement,This item is exactly as described in the literature. The only complaint is that the glass is so thin that it does not take much for it to break.This is the second replacement.It would be a better product if the glass was somewhat heavier.Madlyn
2,thin glass,This was a replacement caraffe for the one that broke after a minor bump. The new one appears to be just as fragile. Manufacturer needs to make the glass shatterproof.
2,doesn't match product,"Krups 016-42 Replacement Carafe, Black: While the carafe looked like it might fit and work properly to the Krups coffee make, it doesn't because of a misfit for the cover pushing up on a spring inside the coffee maker that starts the coffee making. The carafe that came with the coffee maker didn't have a removable top. Is there such a replacement carafe in black?"
1,cheap glass,"The third time I washed the carafe, I touched it against the sink and it broke into a thousand pieces. Haven't made another cup since and it's been about four years now."
2,Light and obvious,"There's not much to say about weblogs, really. Go to scripting.com or megnut.com (run by one of the authors) or caterina.net and see how its done. Then go to radio.userland.com or blogger.com to find out about the popular software options for running a blog.The authors of ""We Blog"" go to great lengths to make weblogs seem deeper and more of a topic for study than they really are. The companion website for the book, blogroots.com, is often full of angst about articles in the popular press misrepresenting weblogs as simply diaries or the phantom topic of ""journalists vs. webloggers."" It all gets tiresome after a while, and it isn't worth buying a book about. Maybe, just maybe, it's the newer breed of webloggers, the ones without agendas, that are making the medium interesting."
2,Obsolete.,"With so many improvements in Blogger and Six Apart's Typepad, this book is by now obsolete. If you want tutorials go online and you'll find thousands that will help you start your blogging adventure."
4,Got me started blogging,"The review from A reader from Champaign, IL USA is obviously someone who knows a lot about Blogs or blogging already. If you have heard about blogs in the popular media, or have happened upon other people's blogs, this book is a great way to get started doing your own.Admittedly, the authors might take this blogging stuff a bit too seriously. But they explained how the tools work, how to get started, and how to get beyond the basics. I was able to create a new blog, get it hosted, and added a comment system. I plan to tackle templates next.If you are looking for a short, easy, hands-on read for the nuts and bolts of blogging, this one does the trick."
2,i was not impressed,"The ""burnt onion"" taste in these breadsticks is too overbearing, but doesn't add any positive spicy notes."
2,For CRYin' Out Loud!,"A lot of $ for a 35 minute DVD, and a grand total of three face-shots of Sun Ra. He gets more screen time on the still-photo feature, with those same three head shots. His *hands* are on screen far longer than he is. The soundtrack is not exclusively Arkestra, either, and what there is sounds like it's culled from ""Sun Song"". The ""educational film"" approach, with its black folks vs. white folks confrontational discourse on what *is* jazz (circa 1959, and its imminent death is forecast) is like a MAD-TV sketch. The word ""Negro"" is used (possibly) a hundred times in those 35 minutes."
3,I've changed my mind.......gave it another listen and.....,"Well, I've had a change of heart with this cd. I found myself bored one night and decided to give this cd another listen and I had a much better reaction to it! It's certainly not her best, but Lisa at her worst is a lot better than the BEST that some can do! By far, the STANDOUT song on this cd is ""I'm Coming To Get You"".Overall, not her best, but better than a lot!"
4,She doesn't disappoint,"An excellent CD. If you like her earlier music, you'll like this CD too! Four stars only because it's a slight notch down from her previous releases."
2,"Face UP, It is not her BEST!","Being a huge Lisa fan, I was excited to finally purchase this cd since it is not being released in the US. When it came today in the mail, I was ready to start it playing.....after listening to the whole thing, I thought to myself what a step down this recording was from her 1997 album, LISA STANSFIELD. That album had not one bad track!!! This one, with the exception of HOW COULD YOU, CANDY, 8-3-1, WISH ON ME and BOYFRIEND, is just not up to her usually stellar songwriting and delivery!! Her voice is drowned out in many cases by the production. I am hoping the next time around, she does what she is capable of!! This is a dissapointment.......not much else to say. I am just not happy with it!"
4,VERY GOOD BUT...,"This was an enjoyable cd but a little disappointing.The British diva has given us such pleasurable music over the years like Change, All Around The World and Never, Never Gonna Give You Up. However there was nothing earth shattering about this cd.Most of the songs were typical Lisa (You Can Do That, 8-3-1 and I've Got Something Better) and some were experiments gone in the wrong direction (Boyfriend-infidelity & Candy-too silly).However Lisa's voice is as powerful as it ever was but held back. She did not provide us with the powerful vocals from, what I consider her best work, her Sophomore cd ""Real Love"".Ultimately the two songs that stand out with her signature sound are 8-3-1 and the title song Face Up.If you are a Lisa fan-this is something to have. You might not love it as much as her stuff in the past. But like me, you will learn to love it."
3,Buena ficción,"Para quienes han leído otros textos de Manfredi, este queda fuera de lote, aunque no precisamente por ser mejor. Sin embargo, los conocimientos arqueológicos del autor, hacen muy creíble este suspenso de ciencia ficción. Nos traslada a épocas remotas y hace renacer a un terrible monstruo para tener en vilo al lector."
4,"Natasha is a DOLL, but..............","....the video portion of this has some problems. What we have here is a Dual Disc rendering of the American version of her ""Unwritten"" album. My five star opinions of Natasha, and of this recording, are already on record. The songs carry a message, and are superbly done. Nasasha is a gorgeous girl, with a wonderful, and clear, voice. But...............The DVD side is difficult to work. The menu is poorly highlighted, and selection of any particular track is hard. Oh, the enhanced audio sounds great on my TV, and the videos are beautiful. [How could Natasha be otherwise]? But, I like to be able to select without a hassle.Natasha, I love you...keep your audio engineer, and your cameraman...fire your video engineer."
5,Unwritten - Natasha Beddingfield,I thought all the songs were easy to learn and appropriate for my kids to listen to also.
2,I wanted so badly to love this album...,"after seeing Miss Natasha perform ""Unwritten"" and ""These Words"" live at the Dick Clark ""Rockin' New Years Eve"" party (yes it's pre-taped). I'd only heard these two songs on the radio and didn't know much about her - but she was so cute and spunky I couldn't wait to run out and buy her cd. (Though the producer did say ""oh good, she's in a good mood today."", which made me wonder, is she normally uber cranky? But I digress..)I did like the song ""Wild Horses"" and the two aforementioned, but the rest of the cd was extremely disappointing - not a memorable track among them. I wanted to make ""Single"" my anthem - but could never end up getting into it.Don't bother buying the cd - go to iTunes or something and just get those 3 tracks..."
3,Fair cd,"A few good songs. If you can download a song or two, go ahead. Would not recommend purchasing the entire cd."
1,This album just sucks,"This is probably one of the worst albums I have ever heard. Other than Unwritten, the rest of the songs are a waste of time. The beats may be nice, but the lyrics are ridiculous. They're great for pop songs, but if you like music that actually has lyrics that don't sound like a 12 year old wrote them, then this is definitely not a cd for you."
3,"The ""D"" is back!","im a big fan of the d even since their hbo show.but now they're on the big screen. plot-- jb and kg meet and jb thinks that kg is a famous sing, but he finds out he is not and he cant pay his rent, the d then does a gig at a club in hope they can play for a battle of the bands with a cash prize so they can pay the rent. but they figure out they suck, so they learn about a pick made from the devils tooth which gives them awsome musical power. so they are trying to find this pick so they can win the battle of the bands and get the money to pay the rent.also with ben stiller, tim robbins.this movie is pretty good not as good as the show but i still like this film. great soundtract as well."
2,"Great music, awful movie","A friend of mine kept frothing at the mouth about how good this movie was. I like Jack Black and I've seen/heard the Tenacious D stuff, so I figured this would be a fun movie. The music in the movie is great and funny, but the rest of the movie is hideous. There's a couple of scenes with Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins that are pretty funny, but when it's just Jack and Kyle it really seems like they're trying to be funny, but not really succeeding."
4,Tenacious D fans will not be disappointed,"People who do not like the D will probably not enjoy this. I am a Tenacious D fan to the max and I loved this. That being said, it is a bad movie. I can't explain myself, have a few beers and dubies before you watch, and you will most likely love it. The training sequences were my favorite part. They are very short, but the training pays off. Yes! 3.5/5"
1,what a disappointment,"This movie should have could have would have been better . . . if you want Tenacious D then get The Masterworks DVD or their CD. This movie was probably a blast for them to make, and I think they had much more fun than the moviegoer did. It just came off kind of flat and boring, needed more edge. sorry Jack"
1,Be FUNNY!!!,"I watched this film last year over the Christmas break and remember being underwhelmed. These guys are funny, and they have a rock `n' roll attitude, why is it that they can't make a movie on their own that is better than ""School of Rock""? Outside of a few good lines (""Your training begins tomorrow at the crack of noon!"" ""Patience, young Grass-smoker."" ""I've had this birthmark since I was born."") and a few good bits (the spread-legs guitar that Kyle plays is pretty absurd), there's not too much there. Okay, Dave Grohl is pretty hilarious as the Devil, and Tim Robbins as the Mysterious/Weird Stranger is okay too, but otherwise - yawwwwwwwwnnnn..."
1,Never recieved,I did not recieve this item. I contacted the seller they that they shipped it on time but I have not received it.
3,Good to watch once...,"Entertaining for a couple reasons.Jack Black is an entertaining actor for the most part. When it comes to comedies like this one or Nacho Libre, well i guess he can play the crazy dumb man pretty well.Movie is about a man (Jack Black) who's dream is to be a rock star. He meets another man (Kyle) who has the same passion. They decide to form a two man band and become the greatest rock stars alive with the help of the ""pick of destiny"", a guitar pick that's part of satan.Pretty pointless plot. But it is entertaining. Funny at times. Good music played by ""satan"".I recommend it for a few laughs, but not to be considered a great movie."
1,Do I have to give it a star?,"I grew up thinking Cheech and Chong movies were funny. In retrospect they were fresh and original even if highly morally questionable. This on the otherhand was trash. 1/3 of the words in all of the songs were F*&K; or its various incarnations so the songs were kind of repetitive after awhile. The storyline was lame. Where was the nudity that you need. Why didn't they achieve greatness in the end? I am guessing the answer to all this was that they were too busy smoking from the devils horn bong.Jack, you are so cocky you are a joy to watch but next time get someone else to write the movie. The script was one long bong hit and that aint good."
4,It hit's home.,"I grew up as a musician in the beach cities of Southern California. In the 80's and 90's my guitar playing friends and I were always looking for the holy grail of guitars and amplifiers. It was ridiculous how excitable we were about playing guitar and guitar equipment. Everything was so magical and secretive. We'd hear about some guy in some basement somewhere who was making these amazing amplifiers or was sitting on some vintage guitars, and we would drive sometimes hundreds of miles to check out their stuff, usually with a lot of drama on the trip. We'd go on these insane treasure hunts all the time. So this movie really does a great job of making fun of us....and yes, there were even times when we would search for rare and vintage guitar picks because they reportedly had something incredibly special about them. We could play with no others than these, for they had ""the tone"". lol"
4,Tenacious D & movie fans will LOVE this DVD!,If you love Tenacious D's awesome music and comedic value that you will absolutely enjoy this movie too! A lot of laughs and any movie with Jack Black is a winner!
4,hilarious.,wish there was a little more music in it but they did a great job. strawberry river = LOL.
3,Could have been great.,"My nephews begged me to watch this and then asked for my opinion. They didn't want lip-service - they wanted to know what I thought about this film. Here it is: great sounding music and some of the lyrics were terrific. The storyline was fun and the cameos hilarious. Here's my problem - why so crude? I don't mind sexual references and rough language when it is essential to the plot. In fact, I'm annoyed when it is excluded when essential to character development (some people will NEVER say ""heck"" or ""sugar"" instead of the alternatives). However - this story could have been great with much less of it. While certain physical acts (I'm writing this so that minors can read it) are a lot of fun, I don't think I need to hear about them (in so many variations) set to music. Jack Black often resorts to shock value for entertainment. It isn't necessary. The guy has loads of talent."
2,Word that come to mind...Worst movie ever!,"Ok, so maybe not the worst movie ever but still pretty horrible. The first time i tried to watch it i turned it off after about ten minutes, i think I've seen it best described as ""Jack Black seems like a 12 year old that just learned how to curse."" His overuse of F#&k, C*#k, and many other words just ruins most of the movie, when i sat down and tried to watch it again i made it through and there were some comical parts, but still i wouldn't recommend this unless your just an epic jack black fan, maybe a really big Tenacious D fan, even though mos fans thought the movie was horrible too."
5,In the right mindframe...,"This movie is amazing. It's semi funny on any day... but under an influence.. it's great lol. Just kind of sucks that Ten D. doesn't seem to actually have a contact link on their website anymore. What's up with that, JB? Wiki tells me you were disappointed that this movie flopped, but you make it hard for fans to tell you they like it. I hear the the gig simulator going boo here. For the rest, get over it. Yes, there's ""foul"" langauge, so what?! It's not supposed to be a great epic; it's supposed to be funny! It succeeds there."
5,Great movie.,"Best movie ever (in my opinion). I wanted to buy it before I could no longer find it anywhere. Great film, and impossible to find anywhere else."
2,Rude language needlessly.,Needless language for the humor. Jack and his partner are hillarious but I don't know what audience this is being marketed to.
3,Not my kind of movie,Ordered for my son who got a total kick out of the movie. Ease of purchasing was very cool. Good deal.
1,Love Jack Black,I was disappointed in the language. It was too much and took over the whole movie. Wouldn't recommend it to many people
3,"Alright movie, but a little redundant","This is an alright movie, and has it's funny parts, but the overall gist of the film just takes tenacious D nowhere they have not been. Quite a few of the rehashing of the old jokes, batroom humor, sensless annoying swearing, and the songs were not nearly the quality of the first Tencious D album, nor their d fun pak single/ep. If you really like the stuff from the original HBO work, and or the master works, then you will like this a lot. This movie is worth renting, but if you buy, get a good deal on it."
3,Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny,This is a very funny movie...I have seen it in the past but wanted to add it to my collection of movies that I have. There was an issue with this specific movie but the seller and i have spoken and figured it out.
4,Meh,"I bought this for my boyfriend, I don't really like the movie. So, I rated it 4 because he absolutely loves this movie."
4,Arrived quickly,"This movie was for my son, so I didn't watch it. I am rating the fact that it came quickly and packaged properly."
3,Could have been so much more,"Tenacious D and the Pick of Destiny could have been a fantastic movie. If they had really expanded more on the show instead of making the D more accessible to Jack Black fans and the general public. I love the D. I have this movie now, and of course I have the double-DVD set of the HBO series. If you really want to enjoy Tenacious D, then buy the series on Tenacious D""VD"". The movie is more or less for completists. It definitely had potential - it could have been fantastic if they had followed up the brilliant opening scene and had made it more or less a rock opera. But oh well...Long live the D!!"
2,Not Quite Here or There...,"Let me set this straight: I'd never seen the HBO series but I liked the whole rawk n roll approach of Jack Black.Tenacious D has a classic plot line but it really needs the audience to be a little more in magic mushroom land before getting into it. It conjures up a lot of films but it isn't quite Wayne's World; Harold & Kumar or School of Rock - it's bits and pieces of all these films and has more of an extended Saturday Night Live feel to it.Jack Black plays the frustrated rocker (aka Jack Black) and there are nice cameos (the best part actually) from Ben Stiller - and Tim Robbins. Kyle Glass is pretty good.The music is ok, but something about Tenacious D is more lame than what it needs to be: Wicked. Definitely a cult film - but not wicked enough for me. I watched it because of JB - but it could've been more Jimi Hendrix and less Blue's Clues... that's about how I'd put it..."
3,Not bad,"This book was not a bad read, I liked the Havamal in the back the most, but I felt too much was trying to be covered in one book and as a result every topic suffered a little. Also, the font is really big, so even though it looks like a big book, it is misleading and you are not getting the full bang for your buck. The pictures were a nice added touch though. It was a good read, and I would recommend it. It just wasn't life changing for me the way some other books on the subject I have read have been (see 'The Nature of Asatru' by Mark Puryear for that!)"
1,totally off base,This guy is way off his rocker and has basically came up with his own self made religion. Strickly for stargazers only. Has nothing to do with Nordic/Germanic asatru.
4,A great Encore for Russell Watson,"Watson's voice has grown stronger and more polished since The Voice. His passion comes through in Italian and English. Che gelida manina, E lucevan le stelle are beautifully done and I loved his O Sole Mio-interesting rhythm. Must admit, his version of Somewhere is my favorite right now and Va Pensiero keeps running thru my mind. If you liked The Voice, you'll love Encore. Hope Russell Watson decides to promote the album with a tour."
1,Absolutely HORRIBLE,"I don't know what Russell Watson and Decca Records was THINKING! Compared to his first album, Encore is certainly a GREAT disappointment! Russell showed promise with his first album, but he should have stopped there.His management team is leading him on the road to ruin! What are they doing?Don't waste your money on this album PLEASE it's a disgrace - Andrea Boccelli's album is miles better than this peice of rubbish!"
3,"Above Average, But Not Great","I really like Russell's first CD, The Voice, and thus have expected this album to have at least the same quality as his first one. Yet, The Encore is somewhat a disappointment. Russell's voice is still charming and powerful, but the songs just don't fit his style at all. Also, the recording is VERY POOR, which greatly degrades the overall quality of this album.Unlike The Voice, which every song in the CD moves me; in Encore, I think only tracks 5, 7, 15, and 16 are comparable to Russell's earlier songs."
1,Unsatisfactory,This cd is really unsatisfactory. The singing is technically substandard and the singer has not bothered in invest any emotion into the music. It's bland and uninteresting.
1,No good,This cd is no good at all. The music is poorly sung and the production is slick but insubstantial. Disappointing!
1,A recording with little appeal,"No, this recording has so little appeal that I cannot recommend it to anyone. Thus, just one star. The singing here is lousy, musically careless, tonally abrasive and stylistically charmless. The recording is over-blown and the musical arrangement over-done. Other than the posh jacket design, which doesn't really count, there isn't anything to recommend in this poorly produced album."
2,"What happened, Mr. Watson?","After being totally enamored with Russell Watson's first album, ""The Voice"", I have to say I am sorely disappointed by his latest offering. There are too many ""pop"" songs, and the opera selections here are plodding and dull. After such a nice selection of songs on his first album, I was hoping for something similar here. Unfortunately, this album did not live up to my expectations. I still like his voice, but I think he should more carefully consider his choice of songs for his next album.However, I loved the first track, ""Va Pensiero."" That's the only reason I gave this album two stars instead of just one. Too bad that song wasn't released on its own as a single..."
1,outrageous,How come such poor performances be released on CD at full price? I think I could have given it a higher rating had it been released at super-budget price! This is outrageous! I regret having bought such a poor-quality CD.
1,This won't do,"This simply won't do! In this kind of cross-over album, I'd expect a pleasant voice used imaginatively, and that there should be joy in the singing. Nothing like these can I find on this CD. Instead, we're treated to a voice pushed and pulled to distortion (both by the singer himself and the record engineers) and singing that is both joyless and technically clumsy. No, this simply won't do!"
1,One of the worst,This is one of the worst CD that I've ever come across irrespective of category. The singer featured here has little voice and an absolutely terrible technique. Musicianship is almost inexistent. What a bad recording this is!
1,Not a tenor,"I found it strange that some people keep calling Russell Watson a ""tenor"" and praising his ""high notes"". Well, if he really is a tenor, he won't need to sing with the aid of the microphone. If his high notes are really impressive, he won't need to transpose some of the music down! Such claims are all groundless and are very misleading. The truth is - Russell Watson is no tenor and does not have secure high notes. He is just an ordinary singer who is embarrassing himself in such music and misleading other people into thinking that he is capable of singing the music by covering up his own inadequacies through marketing strategy. I found the whole phenomenon to be nothing but a farce."
5,Another great CD from Russell,"This is my second CD from Russell and I again have enjoyed every song. His voice is so clear, and I even think it has improved since his original CD ""The Voice."" His sound has made me an opera listener. I enjoy the way he sings both opera and pop tunes with such ease. This tenor's ability to deliver the high notes as well as sing such songs as ""You are so beautiful"" is just amazing. It's hard to explain how his voice captivates you but it will completely. He sings with passion, enthusiasm and gives you a nice variety of music as well. I highly recommend buying Russell new CD ""Encore."" I also recommend buying is first CD, ""The Voice."""
2,Worse than The Voice,"While Russell Watson's 1st album, The Voice, is quite good, this latest album is disappointing. Not only is the choice of music less interesting, the singing shows a marked deterioration from that in The Voice. Why is this so?"
1,One of the worst,"It would be uncharitable to say that this cd by Russell Watson is the worst that I've ever heard. But it's no exaggeration in saying that it is the worst cd I've heard in the last 2 years. And I've bought over 200 cds of all kinds over this period.It is really bad - the voice, which is of ordinary quality, has been poorly employed. What on earth do record companies give us such substandard and boring stuff these days?"
1,From bad to worse,"Judging from ""The Voice"" and ""Encore"", the singing of Russell Watson has gone from bad to worse. His voice in ""Encore"" has lost its shine and there is no improvement in the singing skills. I just don't understand why Watson's recording company can release such substandard stuff."
1,This can't do,"I respect artistic freedom, and people should be encouraged to try out different style. Yets, this should only be attempted, especially for those who're making money out of the venture, by people who have something special to deliver and also the means to do the project justice. Unfortunately, Russell Watson or his singing here has neither of these qualities. As a result, this CD falls flat and is not entertaining at all. What a missed chance!"
4,Unique,"Why do self-proclaimed experts presume to know everything about vocal expression and then insist on pidgeon-holing every artist that breaks onto the music scene. Russell Watson is, as many artists are, unique. He obviously appeals to a wide audience as is evident by his record-breaking album sales. Let him be himself, do his own thing, and if you don't like it.....don't listen!! I object to these so-called ""experts"" trying to convince everyone of what they SHOULD or SHOULD NOT listen to. It's an individual's choice, and if it doesn't sit well with you, then tough!! Russell oozes personality and I'd rather watch and listen to him sing than some of the ""Prima Donna"" opera soloists that 'grace' our auditoriums. I really enjoy the contrasts that Russell offers on both his albums, between his breathy, sexy pop voice and his still in training operatic voice....give the 'bloke' a chance will you?"
4,A great voice in the making,"I am no music critic, but I know a wonderful sound. While in the operatic arias, he is no Domingo or Pavarotti, (but who is?)His voice has power, and beautiful tone. I loved the album. The reviewer who so terribly attacked his albums, must have a personal vendetta against him. (perhaps a high school enemy??)He cannot even sign his own name!I hope Mr Watson continues his training and gives us many more wonderful recordings. Apparently the DVD, is not available in the USA. I hope it will be soon."
1,I hope people didn't actually spend money on this,"Listening to this, I just wish some of those composers (Verdi, Puccini, etc.) were alive today, so they could take a club and beat Russell Watson with it.To say that Watson is the worst opera singer in the world would be unfair. After all, he's not an opera singer. And calling him the world's worst singer would be unfair too, because he's not a singer. He's a welder. And I just hope his welding wasn't as bad as his singing, otherwise cars all over Britain would be having their fenders fall off and so on.I think anyone who considers Watson to have a 'beautiful voice'must have been spending the last twenty years in a cave on Mars with their fingers in their ears."
2,I had ordered...,"I had ordered this CD but canceled my order when I heard a copy at a local music store. I had wanted it because of the ""Enterprise"" theme but it just wasn't worth it."
3,Disappointing,"Although this is not such a bad album, I have to admit I am disappointed. Since I bought Russell Watson's debut album, I have been a big fan of his and have been looking forward to the second album. Maybe I was expecting too much, because I admire the first album very much. He may lack of the traditional classical singers' technique or duration of high section, but he, in his first album, casts a spell on me with his sweet voice and unique selection of the songs. In this second album, he sounds as if he had lost ""The Voice,"" or at least he fails in maximazing its magical quality. The song selection is not as appealing as in the first album, either. I hope this secod album may give him a good chance to reflect on why he managed to become popular and where he should head for in his music career in the future. I hope he will get The Voice back and mesmerize us again."
1,The singer can't do anything,"This album contains a wide range of music. Unfortunately, the singer, Russell Watson, does not succeed in any of the music types. I think Mr Watson should do some vocal studies first and then find out which kind of music he can do best before proceeding to parade his vocal flaws in public."
3,family connection,I sought out this book because my grandfather was raised at the St John's in the Wilderness school and it is where he met my grandmother. My great grandfather and great uncle are mentioned in the book by name. The book would be of interest mostly to individuals with similar connections to the subjects or area. It is readable and interesting. I was disappointed that there was not more information about the school and the orphans that attended. It is mostly a biography of the founders.
5,Solutions for individuals and couples with chronic illness,A thoughtful and caring look at the problems and solutions that face individuals and couples living with chronic illness.
5,Great Gibson Shirt,"Great fit, easy cleaning, great product. Should have an image to show great detail of guitar. Husband loved it & wears it to gigs."
4,Good Series,Nice series. Graphics good for the 80's. Nice to see another universe besides Marvel and DC. The last 5 episodes in this set are the best.
4,Great Memories,"I'm a big fan of this series, as soon as a I get it I started to watch it, great memories!! nothing like those 80's cartoons, you must have this, great price for all first season."
2,Too many anecdotes... it wasn't what I was looking for,"I was really frustrated with this book. Based on all the glowing reviews, I had really high expectations. The Complete Communicator is broken down into five categories: Person to Person, Writing (which goes into editing and getting published), Giving Speeches (accents, stage fright), Listening, and Media (guesting on TV, cultivating relationships, letters to the editor). I didn't need pages and pages of anecdotes to understand the author's points. I feel the Complete Communicator was far too broad in focus and did not concentrate enough on one-on-one communication. I think Communicate or Die and Talk Less Say More offered more of what I was looking for. I'm not saying this book doesn't have value to others. It was just a bit too general for my taste. The glowing reviews led me to buy this one, and I wish I hadn't."
4,"Good Read, Good Advice, And Great Tidbits","I'm not even finished with it yet. But, I'm hooked. This is a well-written book on the art of writing. It has a lot of good information and advice. Plus, he added a few tidbits about some of his own writing experiences including some very funy ancedotes. Thanks, Jerry."
5,The Real Question Is...,"The real question is not whether--if you live to write or write to live--you should read Writing For The Soul. The real question is whether or not you should read it more than once.For this writer, the answer is ""yes!"" Jerry's easy-going style will carry you from beginning to end without realizing you are learning, actually learning, about the gift and call of writing. There are both practical applications (that it is best to spend your good money on a good office chair) and that which seems obvious to most of us, but often is not (""Good writers are good readers. Great writers are great readers. So much of our art is learned from osmosis."").Jerry has truly had an extraordinary writing life. He has graciously shared with us. We would be foolish not to accept the gift. (Man, I hope he doesn't have his thick-skinned editor's pen out right now, she thought. I hope I wrote all this correctly. Or, is it correct? Geez...now I'm puzzled... LOL)"
2,book not complete,"I bought this book and it wasn't complete. The book ends at chapter 12, it should be at least 20 something chapters but amazon refunded my money but i would still like to finish the book!"
4,Mandatory for all women,"I am a Martial Arts teacher, doing women's Self Defense Seminars for many years. I have used this book on many occasions and highly recomend it for all women. It is concise and practical. Professor Don JAcob is a world Famous Jiu Jitsu master you can't go wrong. One of these moves may save your life.Sensei Albert Andrews, Jupiter, FLorida USA"
3,Too Big,I bought these shoes in a size 10(i wear a 9)because I don't like my heel to come over my shoes. I should have ordered a 9. These shoes run a little large. But overall I like these shoes.
5,Krups Replacement Carafe,"We are pleased with the replacement carafe and it works well although I'm glad I read the reviews which said to keep your old carafe top, this is very important as we have an older machine. The new carafe top has a slightly different center that does not fit the older Krups machine where the coffee drops into the carafe. The older top fits the new carafe, although a bit loose."
2,Issues with lid fitting,Lid did not fit the coffee maker I had - seems to be confusion about different models
5,Replacement Carafe,My father-in-law had broken carafe for his Krups coffee maker and have some extensive web searching I found it on Amazon.com. The same carafe can be found in many places but Amazon had the lowest (and of course) best price.
1,Didn't fit our coffeemaker.,"I have a KRUPS KM4055, 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Black. Both, Amazon and the Krups Web site read that this replacement carafe would fit. It was 2 inches too tall. Be sure to physically measure your coffeemaker, before buying."
1,Shattered carafe,"This is the second time I have had this carafe; my husband was going to pour just brewed coffee from this carafe and it shattered just by removing it fromt the coffeemaker. This is the second time that this has happened to us, however this time hot coffee went everywhere. I would not purchase this carafe or any other coffeemaker from Krups that uses a glass carafe as they are obviously not concerned with consumer safety."
1,No replacement,"Although its description said it is a replacement carafe also for a different model, for which I bought it, it did not fit at all. I felt it a nuisance to return it, so I did not return it. But I certainly wasted the money I paid. I was very unhappy."
1,You sent the wrong product!,"We were sent the wrong carafe, and the one sent did not fit our coffee machine. I was then able to get a better price on the carafe dealing directly with the maker of the coffee machine."
2,much like a lead balloon,"I have to agree with the other reviewer- this is the Sutherland you wish could have stayed in the vaults, never to see the light of day again. A critic once wrote that Joan Sutherland without high-flying coloratura is like a sad child who lost their balloon. Parlor songs like these are written for the middle register of the voice, which was always Joan's major weakness, even in the earliest part of her career. Still, when she did sing them in the late fifties / early sixties, at least the voice was lighter and fresher. By the time of Serate Musicali, Joan's voice had thickened considerably, exaggerating the aforementioned flaw.If you want a reasonable document of Joan singing this reperatoire, buy The Art of Joan Sutherland on DVD, which includes a a televised recital from the mid-sixties."
2,Great for Warmth--Cannot wash!!,"I bought these for my husband last winter. It wasn't long before I discovered the problem with them. They kept his feet warm and cozy, BUT you could not wash them . . . so after a while the SMELL was overwhelming!! Then they had to be thrown out. I bought them at the $70 price, so I wished I had bought cheaper ones you could actually wash."
4,nice product,"nice product, made well, very comfy. i bought these for my son for Christmas. They run small. He currently wears a size smaller than what i bought. they ""JUST"" fit."
1,Does not work in Blu Ray player,I bought two differet Living Landscapes HD blu ray movies and neither works in a blu ray player. Working on returning them.
2,Just spend your money on Planet Earth!,"It's blu-ray so the picture is amazing, but the transitions are too slow. The description mentioned white-tail deer - the reason why i bought it for my dad; however, I never saw any, only Elk. I would recommend spending the money on the Planet Earth series - do it right!"
2,Not a good description of product,"I enjoyed the pictures but thought there was a commentary to this product, so a little disappointed. Some scenery stays around for too long so gets tedious."
2,Cheap,This item does what it is suppose to do and looks nice but after about two weeks the emblem fell off of the money clip. Should have invested ina more expensive one.
3,Made in Taiwan...,"That's the only downside to this handy little knife. I'm just really tired of buying products from USA companies, then recieving it and finding (made in China,) or in this case, (Made in Taiwan.)"
5,PVD- Truly is the trance god!,"If your a fan of Paul Van Dyk you must have this 3CD box set.It features all his remixes from as far back as 1992-1998.a lot of tracks here you may or may not have heard.Every single one is quality with the PVD touch!.Every thing he touches turns to gold!.The box set features 2 discs that are unmixed but very well sequenced.The third disc is a an awesome 78min mix by the master himself featuring some all time classics FOR AN ANGEL,FLAMING JUNE(collaboration with BT),AGE OF LOVE etc as well as great remixes of other tracks.Just do yourself a favour and get this it is A LIMITED EDITION!"
5,The BEST Electonica Collection,"This 3 CD collection is simply superb, there's no better way to put it. All tracks flow smoothly and beautifully, with empowering beats and original rhythyms, far superior to many electronica CD. This collection is an absolute must have!"
2,Be forewarned,"Be forewarned....the very opening of all of the movies on this set have been truncated. The source for these transfers is evidently a program hosted by Roy and Dale in their later years. While I have no problem with the DVD's containing the intros, I did not pay for movies that are not in their entirety...COMPLETE opening credits and all.Secondly, the source is not good either. Roan Group did a much better job with their Roy Roger movie transfers.In spite of being ""Authorized by the Roy Rogers Estate""...which made me think they were a safe purchase....these Happy Trails Theatre DVD's are anything BUT high quality."
5,The best Savatage album with the greatest vocal performance,"Streets by far is the best Savatage album and it has Jon Oliva's best vocal performance as well. Jon shows off all of his different vocal capabilities on that album from mad soulful lows like in Heal My Soul, to high screams like the end of Ghost In The Ruins, and everything in between, he does raspy, grating, grinding,and then turns around and nails smooth emotion filled ballads, the raw emotion, the completeness of each song and how each one is perfect. It's just one of the aspects of Streets that makes it so perfect. His keys on Streets are also outstanding, his vision and the end result of the album speak volumes about what he can accomplish when he sets his mind to it. Then when you add Criss' playing and the atmosphere they created within that album that puts you right there and makes it all feel so real."
5,"one of the best, out of everything","This is one of my (very few) favorite albums. Period. Criss on guitar and Jon not screaming. This and 'Edge of Thorns' are truly beautiful and impressive albums I can listen to repeatedly and then again. These are good people and amazingly talented musicians you don't want to miss out on, just because so many others did."
4,Streets: A Rock Opera,"Just like it states... ""Rock Opera Music"". Try it, you may like the way it moves."
3,"A concept album, which is hard to do by any band","Like Fate's Warning's ""A lighter shade of grey"" cd, this concept cd from Savatage drags down in monotony by having to write songs in trying to complete the tale.Very few bands can do such a cd terrifically, and I give credit to Savatage for making one that I still can listen to without wanting to sell it.If this were 10 star review, I would give it 6/10"
2,"Very disappointing, no headbanging here.","This album shows that they disappeared up their own ***. It was too much a progression into intricate song writing with lots of piano and tempo changes which makes for a very boring album, in my opinion. If you want metal with class buy their previous albums, Mountain.. being the best. This album is not for headbangers..maybe thinkers(whatever that means)?"
1,boring,I loved gutter ballet but thought streets was one of the worst things i had ever heard. I sold it to the pawn shop for 25 cents. It's not even worth that!
1,Got boring fast!,"Well, it seems that you think you could like this band forever, than you get tired of it after a few weeks. When I first heard this band, I thought ""Wow. Queen with metal guitars."" Some of you may remember my review of this album about a few months ago. Well, let me say this..These guys do not rock! Every song is a ballad or 80's thrash metal, which should've died a long time ago. Criss Oliva is a great guitarist, however, but the rest of the band isn't. Jon Oliva sounds like Meat Loaf with an astma attack, Johhny Lee Middleton plays about 3 notes in a song, and the drummer's drums are OVERPRODUCED! I used to think Believe was a sad story, but now it's just epic nerd rock. If Criss left the band and did his solo stuff, I would've listened to it. I'm sorry, people. I can't listen to this anymore."
5,Cute Board Book!,"All of of these little board books by Amy singer are great. Perfect for the toddler who loves to turn the pages and learn about something a little different than, ball, duck, and dog!"
4,Slick,"SLICK is a good name for this book. I love Brenda Hampton books and this was no different. I was really shocked at how the book ended, but this makes you really think if you can trust your girlfriends and make you wonder about the advice that they give...."
4,great read,"this was a great read . this was my first time reading her books, i will read all of her books"
3,Slick,"this book was a soap opera with to many irresponsible horny, self centered, adults. If the term ""just say no"" applied, I guess there wouldn't have been a book. It kept me interested because I kept trying to figure out who else was going to get caught-up in the mix and how they were going to get out of it. Talk about drama...this book has it."
5,"Let's Face It, Slick'S GOT IT GOING ON!","Five stars again for my favorite author who seems to very well have it going on. I do agree that this book being a republished edition of her previous book was confusing, but I do question those who wrote bad reviews and call themselves fans too. I hope that there's a way for Amazon to inform readers about these changes too because it would help those who do not read the book description. Either way, I enjoy reading Ms. Hampton's novels and she will always be a five star author through my eyes."
2,"Poor story, bad editing.","This book was lame, lame, lame. The writing was poor and the plot was terrible. At the end she had the nerve to interject ""the man up stairs."" There were so many grammatical errors! I would be very reluctant read another book from this author. Please don't call someone your best friend ""when you have eyes for her husband."
4,Damn!,"This book kept me on my toes. Johnathan was somethin else. Syliva stabbed Dana in the back, but then again she got what she asked for for cheating with Lewis. At the end Dana got what she asked for. This is one of those books, where the friend wants her best friends man, b/c he is being cheated on and lied to. Read at your own risk."
1,Fat girls kill too!,"EVIL DEAD TRAP is a great film. If you haven't seen it, you're in for a treat. This is not a sequel. It's about a fat girl who kills people, because she's lonely. It's pretentious and dull. If you like watching fat girls kill people, watch FEMALE TROUBLE instead."
2,Not sturdy,"We've had this chair for a bit over a year and really loved it until this weekend. My 22 pound daughter was eating breakfast in the high chair when all of a sudden I heard a cracking noise and upon inspection, the plastic on BOTH sides of the chair that attaches the chair to it's stand (the part that holds the chair in place and allows the chair to move up and down)cracked in half and the seat, with my daughter in it, was about to fall backwards onto the floor. If you purchase this chair, inspect it often."
1,Not worth it,"I was so disappointed with this high chair when I got it home and fed my son in it for the first time. I'v got the same complaint as some of the other parents as far as the height of the tray. My son is also very tall and the tray was at his shoulders. He's almost 6 months old and looked teeny tiny in that highchair and not very comfy because of it. PLUS, the tray was very difficult for me to take on and off, it was like the one I got was not made right....and actually one of the plastic peices where the tray slides on popped off a few times. This chair was definitely not worth 99.99! I should have gone with my first instinct and got the Fisher Price Aquarium high chair, way cooler chair. We ended up taking back this baby trend the next day and getting the fisher price aquarium and he sits way better in it, and it's really easy to put the tray on...and it has toys! I dont know why I got the baby trend....I felt way better spending $100 on the fisher price Aquarium high chair."
1,"Bad customer service, bad company","i receibed a baby trend high chair at a baby shower on july 17thtried to put it together when baby started eating solids in decemberwrong parts in boxcalled to ask for new onespromised new ones, but never receivedcalled back in januarythey told me i had to pay for them because it had been over 6 monthswon't give refund, due to the fact it was a gift and no receipt"
5,We love this highchair.,"We love this highchair. My 6 month old is very comfortable in it. This chair gives the plush, armchair type dining experience for our baby. We put the cotton cover on top of the vinyl so it's extra padded and comfy. She can reach the tray when properly strapped in the 5 point harness, it is very sturdy and i like that i can use the cotton cover for her now and maybe switch to vinyl later when she is older.The other important factor in favor of this chair is that the underside of the tray is a smooth surface unlike other chairs with ridgy trays. we felt that our baby's legs [kicking endlessly against the chair] could get hurt by a non-smooth surface. I also like that it is in upright position when placed in the least recline position [unlike evenflo chairs which can never be placed upright] and comfortably reclines for a small baby to relax when not eating.The only con i have is that the tray is too heavy to handle and is not a one hand insertion."
5,after reviewing EVERYTHING!,"so i know how you feel, seeking the saftest high chair, but all of them look the same and none stands out more than another other than the $$$! So after reviewing, researching and finally checking things out in the store, my husnad decided on this chair while i was eyeing one doubled the price thinking that it would be best. boy was i wrong! this chair was not only affordable, it was easy to manuever, has safely straps and a bar between the legs so your child will not slide out. it also has a removable top tray for furture safety. the designs are cute as well.my only complaint is the trouble of removing the cloth to throw into the dryer. but it is washable and a great product! save your $$ and your piece of mind and get this high chair!"
5,trend high chair,excellent chair. This is my first grandchild and I am always concerned on contruction of something he would be sittingin. Im very pleased.
3,not to good,"the tray sticks and is hard to push in and out. It rolls great but the tray track is bad, not smooth at all"
2,Very Childish-looking,"The necklace is a lot shorter than I imagined--it's literally half an inch away from being a choker. The pendant is not in proportion and much much larger. I was looking for a cheap Valentines day gift for my gf, but this is just too childish."
3,"Delicate chain, nice pendant.","This is a nice silver necklace. The chain has an extension, otherwise would be too short for the heart pendant. The heart pendant is pretty and larger than 1"", but the silver is a lighter weight than what I normally wear."
5,A Great Resource,"Kalani has done it again! An excellent resource for the music facilitator, classroom teacher, or music therapist. Kalani breaks down the skills needed to facilitate successful music experiences and lays the techniques out in a clear and easy to follow format. His DCMI innovation is a great way to communicate ideas for drumcircle facilitation. I highly recommend this resource for the beginner all the way to the seasoned pro in music facilitation. This book is chock full of helpful tips to get you out there to help others find their rhythm. AND you have to see the DVD that is included. An eyes on approach that lets you see the facilitation in action with a true community drumcircle."
2,"Good facilitation techniques, but no rhythms outlined.","The book outlines specifics well, but I think it is important to see from beginning to end, how a drum circle excercise/rhythm is followed through. The video just shows excerpts. Also, no syncopated rhythms were broken down visually or in the book. You have order the next installment to get the drum circle rhythms! The instructor's method is great, but I was left feeling that some crucial beginner elements were missing from this video."
5,This is a great book about facilitating - Drums or otherwise,"I am just getting started with drumming - but I have facilitated other kinds of groups for many years. This is by far the most helpful resource I have ever found on the basic art of facilitation (vs. teaching or leadership). Though the book is focused on facilitated drum circles, I highly recommend this book for anyone involved in any kind of group facilitation. That includes corporate events and brainstorming and committees, church small groups or youth events, camp counselors, etc."
3,"OK Book, don't use as only reference",I bought this book after failing the first time and also used PrepLogic software but failed. The book helps somewhy but doesn't really go far enough for the needs of the exam.
1,Doh!,"As a humor book, I would give this 5 stars. But it's not. I'm a guy and had borrowed it to read, just to get an idea of these 'rules' books. I loved all the 'Man Facts'. I actually laughed out loud. And was fairly insulted.Waiting to find the person you're meant to be with can be frustrating. So there's no sense taking advice that turns it into strategy, and turns frustration into bitterness. If you have to follow 'rules', you're playing a game. If a guy can give some advice, be yourself."
1,A Bunch of Bull,"I don't even want to elaborate on the crap this woman has written. But readers should be aware. First of all, how can a person take advice from someone who is in her mid to late 40s and never married? What can she tell a sister about finding the ""right"" mate when she haven't even found him for herself? What a hypocrite! 'Do as I say, not as I do' syndrome.It's a sin and a shame that people will cheaply cling their paws into lonely women and write anything to soothe their burning flesh just for the sake of fame and fortune. Ladies, I say, see what Jesus says about love and marriage and stay away from the predator writers who lean unto their own understanding."
4,Pretty good!,"I thought this book was pretty good. Being single is hard when you really desire to be in a relationship. Michelle's books are always a good ""pep talk""... the difficulty, for me, is to put her suggestions into practice."
2,Not Necessarily,"As a guy, you want to be in tune on what the sisters are saying about you. When a man finds a woman he finds a good thing. Sure enough. But ladies, please be prepared to be found. I wasn't in agreeance with this sister but I do give her some credit. I'm one of those type guys that believes in doing it the Bible way. For no other way will work for me. But I can recommend a book that is on point about women being prepared and position to receive her mate and when she gets him, what she should do to keep him. That book is called WOMAN, TAKE YOUR POSITION by Beverly (forgot the last name), but the book is right-on."
2,THOMAS THE TRAIN SET,"WE BOUGHT THIS TRAIN SET FOR OUR GRANDSON BECAUSE IT SEEMED SO STURDY BECAUSE THE TRACK IS MADE OF WOOD AND YOU CAN ALWAYS ADD EXTRA TRAINS AND TRACKS FOR THE FUTURE... THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS THAT THE TRAIN WILL ALWAYS GO OFF THE TRACKS WHEN IT STARTS TO MAKE A TURN. FOR THIS REASON, I WOULD NOT RATE THIS ITEM EXTREMELY HIGH."
3,Battery died.,Thomas's battery died on day 2. Otherwise iris fun. However don't know how to replace the battery. That is all.
5,Awesome purchase,"I am pleased with the construction. I purchased this item for toddlers, and believe it will be more durable. There are enough pieces to make a very nice sized track."
3,"Okay, but company needs to improve it","I really wanted a battery-powered train for my son, and at the time, Thomas and Friends train sets were the only ones I could find that were fairly priced. This train set is ""okay"". I read reviews that this falls off the track while going around corners and to buy a couple more train cars to prevent this from happening. I purchased two more train cars at the same time as purchasing this train set. Yes, it helps having about 3 cars being pulled to avoid the falling over around corners, BUT this also creates more weight for the engine to pull, thus creating a problem pulling all that weight up the hill to go over the bridge! The train set is also a lot smaller than I anticipated. The train engine and cars are about 2 inches long. The track itself is about 1.5 inches wide. I am a little disappointed in this product. I plan to look into GeoTrax train sets now- which were recommended to us by a friend."
4,Pretty Clever,"This show sends-up so many medical series and movies that it's hard to keep track. It's pretty funny & clever, and there's a lot going on. Pay close attention and you'll have some fun."
2,a bit disappointed,"I was looking forward to seeing this show, but it was silly. Nothing spectacular. I won't be spending more money on the other seasons."
1,Bad,"Bad. Bad, bad bad. And stupid too! Even the ding-dongs this series represents wouldn't find this funny.I want my 99 cents back."
2,KD tools valve grinding tool,This tool will not stick to the valves at all. Every time I go to spin the valve it just falls off. Consider a higher quality piece.
3,Not my favorite Jane Austen,Love and Friendship is definitely not my favorite Jane Austen book. This is her early work and is a group of letters. I had a hard time wanting to read it so I could finish it and move on to something else.
2,Great Start,Bear had me engrossed through the first 2/3rds of this novel. Then it just faded away. This book is not what we've come to expect from Mr. Bear.
1,Too Loose,"The handle does not hold the shaft tight, keeps falling off and after having it a long period of time it gets so stuck inside the handle it take a pliers to pull it free, I should know I bought over a dozen all at once. I owned one before (you know the ones you get at those hardware stores) and it was the best until I lost it, so I tried these.YUCK!"
3,"Gold, Miners, and Strikes","I was disappointed in this book by Todhunter Ballard, after having read and collected his work for many, many years. And I think I know the reason why--he probably didn't write it. After reading the foreward, I think it makes it clear enough. Too bad. Todhunter Ballard has written some excellent books, and not just westerns; and as John Hunter even more great stories of the west. This one is just not one of those. It is readable, but barely. Sorry, I had to say such things about someone who is dead, and can't defend themselves, but I think he too would agree with me."
5,Two Tons of Gold,"The Bank of California in the 1860s is a powerful company that pays its mine workers very little and will not tolerate strikes, sending in vicious strike breakers to beat down any opposition. When Major Mark Dorne's father is murdered by strikebreakers, he begins a one-man war against the bank, always leaving behind his calling card - a small silver coin. Now the Major is ready for his most daring attack yet, the theft of five million dollars in gold coins from the Bank of California, from under the nose of the Wells Fargo guards. But his enemies are aware of his plans and have devised a foolproof way to stop this war once and for all!--- from book's back cover"
3,"""Getting"" Emotional Discipline","""Emotional Discipline"" ... a Manz first for me. I ordered 2 of his books at the same time from this seller after reading Goleman's ""Emotional Intelligence"" and ""Social Intelligence"", both very impressive reads.Hopefully a reader gleans some benefit from these pages. I skipped over all his ""poems"", actually grimacing each time he presented another offering; I love poetry. Really ""too little time"" to take in the really 'move me off the page' stuff out there... if I make time, I look for depth of material; why bother if the stuff doesn't stimulate your brain to process. With Manz's stuff I felt like I had definitely wandered into the shallow end of the pool. What proved a most helpful construct - for me - the 5 steps, the skeleton that he fleshes out the rest of the book around.All in all, just not worth the price. So get ye to the city Library for this one, if ye be interested in ""getting it"". As always Amazon's service was wonderful."
5,The most comprehensive Islam 101 book,"This book seeks to present Islam`s true face and make it known in a summarized form with most of its aspects.Islam, which literally means peace, submission, and obedience, is the religion of the whole universe. The universe is orderly, a cosmos whose parts are linked together and work together for the same purpose and goal. This book seeks to present Islam`s true face and make it known in a summarized form with most of its aspects: Islam`s essentials of faith, principles and ways of worshipping God, morality, and rules ordering human life and relations between people."
5,Great buy!!!!,"Having a new Krups carafe has made all the difference in the overall look of my (fairly old!) coffeemaker. After 10 years, my old carafe was worn out and covered with water spots that I could not remove. Now I wake up to a ""clean"" look--and this was worth every penny I paid. I believe I got a bargain!!"
5,Exactly what I needed.,"I worried after ordering that it did not have the lid, but it did and it went perfectly into my Krups Pro-Aroma. Mornings are good again!!"
1,Would somebody please list the titles on this collection?,Would somebody please list the titles on this collection?
1,Hold out for the real deal,"There is only one way to package classic TV programs, and that's one box set per season, in order of original air date. As long as the people who own the rights to this program insist on releasing a few episodes in haphazard order (and then repackaging them in a 'Marathon', whatever that's supposed to mean), we should refuse to buy them. When the full 'The Andy Griffith Show, Season One', box set comes out, I'll be first in line to buy it. Meanwhile, we shouldn't buy ripoffs."
3,List the episodes,All of these reviews complain about how the episodes are not listed on the box. How about listing them in your review? Then your review would be most helpful.
1,"It's an insult to Andy Griffith, a great actor ....",How can they do this to a great show and great actor(s) like Andy Griffith. The DVDs' quality is the most horrible and made a fan like me feel very sorry for them.So upset and sad. I never touch that DVD ever again.
2,Not impressed,"The quality isn't that great. I've seen most of these episodes in the DVD bargain bin at the dept store.The episodes included are: ""High Noon In Mayberry,"" ""The Big House,"" ""Mountain Wedding,"" ""A Wife For Andy,"" ""Opie And The Spoiled Kid,"" ""Rafe Hollister Sings,"" ""The Loaded Goat,"" ""The Great Filling Station Robbery,"" ""Andy Discovers America,"" ""Aunt Bee's Medicine Man,"" and ""The Darlings Are Coming""."
5,TOO MUCH,"Ok, these characters were cutting it up! All this drama just to fall in love. I LOVED IT! Brax was my kind of man; Imani was a real sister trying to do her best in motherhood & romance; and Nia...shorty...I wanted to ring her neck my self, but I did understand her. And I loved what happened to Nigel in the end, HILARIOUS! You go, Ms. Harrison, keep writing."
5,WHEN PERFECT AIN'T POSSIBLE,"I really enjoyed the book.Brax had me goin' and I do mean goin! Cause he had it going on. I truly believe the interaction of the characters was very realistic. Being a step-mother myself, I understand what Brax went through with ""shorty."""
4,Worth it...,This book arrived in good condition from the sender and before time. The book has sufficient and clear information with descriptions to match.
4,good guide,"good guide to lots of information. Good reference for any design library. It touches base on resumes, presentation, etc."
4,using it in 3D studio class,just the book for beginning intr design students to use thru out their schooling. it covers everything they need to do all the presentations for thier courses. from drawing to models and most useful those sample boards. it tells you what tools to buy (with photos to help) and as basic as how to cut foam core. it has color step by step examples for color rendering. all in the same book is such a good value to the students
4,Great resource for ID students,"I just received this book and I wished I had had it for my first in-class presentation. I gives the reader ""fresh"" ideas and helpful information on organizing your boards. I would recommend this book to any Interior Design student."
4,leighbeec,"For the novice designer, this is fab! It covers the basics with great examples. It's loaded with ""How to's"", from orthographic drawings, floor plan drawings , presentation boards to resumes!This book is a keeper."
3,Nor Elle - Phantom Of Life,"Norman Feller's downtempo debut as Nor Elle, PHANTOM OF LIFE, focuses more on the ambient side of things, as with the title track, though little hints of beats filter in. ""The Real Thing"" has some bongos for a Balearic feel that's emphasized by the crumbs of guitar that appear. The longer ""Silent Storm"" sets itself adrift on more of a gentle rain than a storm, really. Some light jazz-step livens up ""Moon B252,"" which is unfortunately saddled with the most overused samples ever -- the NASA moon landing -- but ""La Rue Jules Verne"" and ""Disembodied Consciousness"" succeed in their spacier approaches. But much of the album floats by pleasantly and forgettably, though the fake saxophones on the closer ""Into the Sea"" are memorable -- just not in a good way."
5,EVE AND HER MAN GET 5 STARS FOR A MARVELOUS READ FROM ME,"quick review:THIS IS A STORY OF BETRAYAL ALSO. AND IT'S IN AUTHOR ROCHELLE ALERS, HIDEAWAY SERIES.I LOVE THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT'S GOT SO MANY UNEXPECTED TWISTS AND TURNS IN THE PLOT, YOU NEVER EVEN SEE THE END COMING, AT LEAST NOT UNLESS YOU LOOK AHEAD.BUT IT'S ALSO A VERY PASSIONATE ROMANCE. CAN YOU SAY HO-OOO---OOOO-----TTT????WELL, I WANT TO KEEP READING IN THIS SERIES BECAUSE SO FAR THE BOOKS ARE WONDERFUL."
2,First Naked Chick from Howard Stern not worth much,The only thing noteowrthy about this singer is she was the fist woman ever to get Naked on the Howard Stern show. She should have conitinued with that becasue her singing voice definitely is more South Philly than South Beach. Save your money.
5,Superb Smooth Jazz CD!!!,This CD is a perfect example of smooth jazz at its best. I was not familiar with Mark Douthit until this project but his renditions of some of the old classics are really intriguing. I would recommend this to any fan of sax music and smooth jazz in general.
2,Junk,"Bought this and hoped it would be better than the last. It wasn't.Piece of junk. Never turned on right, and couldn't tighten it down."
3,Lamp,"IT's OK.I can find an use. Came with a chipped part wich I' ll have to fix, but is not a big deal."
3,"Nice clock, but ticks loudly.","The price is great, the clock is nice, but it ticks too loud to be hung on a wall above a bed...."
4,little blue clock,Love the gentle tick-tock! Inexpensive little blue clock that fills the bill and matches color scheme in our kitchen.
2,"Specifications say 10"" diameter, but it's 8.5""","I went through several clocks before choosing this one. In reading the descriptions of the various clocks I looked at, I saw that some clocks said they were 8.5"" in diameter and I wanted a 10"" clock. The specs below the photo on this clock said this was ""10 inches in diameter"" and the shipping size was 10.6"", so that's what I thought it was. But this clock is only 8 inches. So beware, if you're looking for a REALLY small clock, I think this would fit the bill, it seems to work fine and keep decent time. But if you're looking for a 10"" clock, this isn't it."
4,"Love this series, this presentation is a bit lame","While I'm not a big fan of all the extras that are included these days on many DVDs to have next to nothing is very lame. It would be great to have the option to see interviews from the actors, many of whom seem to have reached a deadend in their careers after the series and the movies that followed. It would be great to have a guide to the series or a dictionary of terms that are used. Anything. But there is next to nothing. In fact, the DVDs are double sided which I believe lowers the lifespan of them. The series deserved better treatment than this."
4,Green Eyes - Where is the second half?,"I am very happy to finally have the series, I had the wisdom to record what episodes I could. These got me through the dry times before and between movies. I was happy to see the transfer to DVD finally available.But what happened to the second part of Green Eyes? Certainly the behind the scenes was ok, but it only took 5 minutes, surely there was space to put the second half of Green Eyes on to the DVD. Maybe they wanted to create a hook to get us to buy the movies DVD? But then Green Eyes doesn't appear to be on the movies DVDs. So what is up?"
5,Alien Nation - The Complete Series,"I bought this new from Amazon after reading lots of reviews. I was skeptical however about the quality because of a lot of bad reviews. I was pleased with the quality though after watching all 6 discs. I didn't think of it at the time but I am using a Toshiba up-converting dvd player. It must work because I thought the picture & sound were fine. I've never seen Blue Ray so I can't compare it that way, but I am happy over all that I got this series. It was kind of expensive but you do get 22 episodes. All my dvd's played fine on both sides, although I really don't like 2 sided discs.I'm 58 years old so I'm used to some pretty bad tv reception over the years from these bogus cable companies. The discs are better than when I watched the shows originally on tv. Go ahead and get this series if you liked it on tv or like sci fi in general. A really good story line with lessons for us all to live by."
2,Alien Nation - The Complete Series,"I was not happy with this product out of 22 episodes 12 were missing and by time I discovered it out it was too late to send back so I had to settle for a refund of half of the money which was fair; nevertheless, if I want to see the complete series I have to buy it again. I just will not do that, and I'm not watching what I have because so many part II's of the stories are missing. It was just a lesson learned, if you buy any products use them in time to send the purchase back for a full refund if the product is not working."
3,Alien Nation DVDs......,"I had read a review by a woman that had to return the DVDs several times due to problems with the discs, like skipping, freezing, etc. so I was a little hesitant to purchase. Well, I have NOT had that problem so far and I am now on disc 3.The problem I have is the recording itself. Very, very poor quality. For the amount of money they charge you for the complete series, you'd think they would have put a little time, money, effort and care into the recording.I absolutely LOVE the show, but the poor quality recording of the discs took away all the excitement of sitting down and watching the entire series on a Saturday afternoon........"
4,Alien Nation DVD,Great series. I watched when it was on TV. I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the DVD's. Maybe I am am used to the new High-Def/Blu-ray videos... Looked like a VHS tape that was transferred to digital. Fun to watch though.
4,delighted,I've enjoyed this series when it was on TV. Now I get to give myself the joy and pleasure of Alien Nation.Delivered promptly.Thank you.Barbara Henson
3,Faded Memory,"Granted, I have just begun to view the series, but I did so after watching the movie with James Caan. My memory of the TV show is not serving me well, as it's not as good as I recall (and I watched them all back then). And in comparison to the movie, the series just does not measure up. It seems hokey and poorly acted and constantly straining for humor."
4,The Series,If you saw just one of the shows when on the air the rest of the series is now here for your enjoyment to view at your pleasure.
4,No TV Movies & Picture Quality Could Be Better,"It may be the ""Complete Series"" but does not include the four TV Movies made in later years.Picture quality is okay but seems too colorful and a bit fuzzy.Audio level also changes greatly from episode to episode so be very careful with your volume control.Six double sided DVD box set with two episodes per side with no indication on packaging that DVD's are flippers.Last DVD does feature a special on the making of Alien Nation.This in places has a better picure quality than the episodes!Please note however this special is five minutes in length - WOW!So yes another great series let down by poor transfer to DVD with little or no quality control."
3,Missing Disk,"I purchased this item for Christmas and was generally pleased with the product...until I got to disk 5 only to find that there was no disk 5 in the set, I received two disk 6's but no five...lost four episodes...beware.."
5,Spectacular series,"I truly loved this no nonsense series. Slavery, racism and other issues come to light as ""humans"" of all ethnicities come face to face with another race from another planet, no where else to go, former slaves who are trying to find themselves and make a life amidst fear, stupidity and hatred. The opening tv movie was amazingly powerful, the series was riveting. But, sadly, as with all Fox's hits, was cancelled at the height of it's popularity. It's too bad Fox doesn't know how to handle great shows."
5,Great old Sci-fi show!,"I was still watching cartoons when this show first aired, so it is great to have to oppurtunity to get to see this show on DVD. I'm also glad to see that the show got a resolution to its cliffhanger in the form of 5 TV Movies that are now on DVD as well.There was a ton of potential in this show and I'm amazed that the show didn't last longer, and I'm actually waiting to see it re-imagined for the CSI generation.I'm surprised at how often I will revisit the show, so having both DVD releases makes this a welcome addition to my DVD collection."
4,Alien Nation series,I wasnt sure what to expect but it was everything that the series is.nothing cut out. it was odd though for the first time ever you have to flip the disc over to view the rest of the seriesThere seems to be a few stories short but they could be all there. I remember more but it could be in the movie series. or this was all they were able to release. I really cant say this is complete
3,So-So Packaging,"Upon opening the first season/premiere episode package, there were three disks in a 2-disk holder. One of the disks was just losely thrown in with the other two, with no place to hold three disks. Disappointed."
3,Not the Whole Story,"There is just too much going on in the movie for the producers to have condensed it into the 2 hour 15 min time frame on the DVD. While this is a decent summary of the original series, there isn't enough in here to get the point of the story across.Should have been a double disc. This abridgement of the movie doesn't justify the power of these drug cartels and the political strength they have on both sides of the border."
1,It's missing about 230 minutes,As with many other reviews I was truly disappointed. The editing is spotty at best. Seeing the whole mini series would have been alot better. The shorter version lost alot of the characters and isn't really worth the time watching it. I have heard of the mini series and hav not seen it. So as many people who have already commented - I am waiting for the mini series to come out on dvd. It is truly an injustice of what they had done with the film. It would have been better to release it in its entirety.
1,Drug Wars - The Camerena Story,Too many scenes were cut out from the original film. The scenes that were cut out greatly dilutes the full impact of this case and the conclusion as it relates to the consequences of those corupt individuals involved in the murder of Kiki Camerena.
2,drug wars sucked,I saw this movie when it aired on tv and so much of the movie was not included in this video. this video does not tell the whole story and it's a shame because this was a really great film. i tried contacting the company who released the video and had no success. Drug wars the whole movie is a great film.
2,Drug Wars The Camarena Story,"I bought a copy of the ""Drug Wars"" and was extremely disappointed; all the main plot were eliminated. There is one scene in which the drug lord started to explain to his guys why he got into the drug business, selling it to America; it was a beautiful scene that waseliminated. They condensed it very badly. I would advice buyer to be very careful about this buy; now if a buyer had never sean the series, he/she might not know what is missing. I would have returned the VHS, but decided to throw it away instead."
2,Make sure you view the DVD right away upon purchasing it,I added this DVD to my video library. Due to my own fault I did not check it as soon as it arrived. After the 30 day refund policy was up I discovered the first 45 minutes of the movie was not there. Now I have to repurchase the movie. What a rip off.
3,3 of 5,"The problem with John Singleton's Rosewood, based on a real-life massacre that happened in 1923 after a black man allegedly beat and raped a married white woman, is that it goes on for too long. It's a few consecutive days condensed down to about 140 minutes, but the plot could've rolled along more productively in two-thirds the time. There's lots of filler, including hints of a very unnecessary romance, but the action scenes; if black people being lynched, shot and hung qualifies as such; are generally worth the wait. I'd just add that the south back then wasn't only filled with racists; the whites were racist toward the blacks and the blacks were racist right back; but also sexists and ageists as the lives of men were considered expendable in comparison to the lives of women and children.marcellee.com"
4,Thank god things are changing.,"The topic of discrimination between the blacks and whites was alot worse years ago. This movie gives a decent view of the way things use to be. But I guess we still got a ways to go concerning loving each other. This world is so messed up today that I dont think it will ever happen. At least not until the second coming of our lord. Watch the movie, But keep an open mind. Things could of gotten worse."
5,Great Movie concerning historical facts of what happen,Well What can I write about this true story about Rosewood. I am impressed with the location and the wardrode of period costume was true to life.
2,"Great movie, AWFUL DVD!!!","Rosewood is a great movie!! The cast is well directed, and the subjectmatter is not sugar-coated, so get ready for racial violence & prejudice typical of the early 1900's.Now, as for the DVD, I HATE IT!! For some strange reason, Warner Brothers felt the need to split the movie into halves, so that you have to turn the disc over during the movie!! What's up with that ?? The VHS version is on one tape, and this DVD lacks any special bonus features to warrant a 'mono layered' disc.They did the same thing to the great'Goodfells' movie, so try to read DVD specs on the back of any Warner Brothers case.They have a habit of making lackuster DVDs!!"
4,...in the words of Martin Luther King,"Rosewood being something that actually happened shows what happens when people make pre-judged decisions. Martin Luther King said it best in one of his speeches. Its not the color of one's skin but the content of their character that counts. At the begining of the film a lie is told and that lie was the beginning of the end for the town of Rosewood, Fla. but also towards the end there was a change in the character of only three of the people in the film. It is also living proof that even today racism is still alive."
3,"Somewhat flawed, read the book first","Shrtly before this film came out, I wrote an article on the actual Rosewood and Tulsa massacres. The film shows the destruction as being far worse than what it actually was and that business about John Voights affair with Miss Bousia and the character of ""Mr. Man"" never happened. This was dramatic license. However, if you want the real facts about the Rosewood Massacre, read Michael D'Orso's ""Like Judgement Day"" upon which this movie is based.One of the other reviewers asked how many other Rosewoods were there. The answer was THOUSANDS between the 1860s and 1960s. Read Ralph Ginzburg's ""100 Years of Lynchings"" for similar stories in other cities and towns. Also read Scott Ellsworth's ""Death in a Promised Land"" about the Tusla Massacre of 1921, which has yet to be filmed about aside from scant mention in some documentaries."
3,Guns are good.,"Good show except for the rather 2 dimensional characters (previously discussed in other reviews). I am surprised that no one caught on to the fact that the black citizens who were armed were able to fight back. The unarmed were gunned down, mutilated, raped, burned, and on, and on. Lots of the normal rah rah about racism, injustice, etc, but almost nothing about defending one's life, family, and property against armed thugs by being armed. Heck of an idea!Of course, thank goodness the Sheriff showed up to preserve peace and justice! HA!..."
4,Great Movie Bad DVD,It is a flipper! You have to switch sides of the DVD to finish watching the movie. This is another poor example of Warner Brothers saving a buck.
3,only got to see half,"I purchased this dvd abouth a month ago. I went to finally watch it this weekend. I only got to watch half of it, due to the fact of the movie stops 1hr and 10 minutes into it. I tried 3 different dvd players and the movie stopped 1hr and 10 minutes later. Needless to say i was very disappointed. From what I did see it is a very good movie. I can only give it 3 stars cause i didn't get to see the rest."
1,Ripped Off!,"Rosewood is a movie I had seen years ago and liked very much. I chose to purchase a copy so that my husband would be able to see it. We were half way through the movie when it just stopped. For some reason the manufacturer found it okay to only put 1/2 of the movie on the DVD. I was truly disappointed that my husband was unable to finish the movie due to the manufacturer's inability to deliver a whole copy. This movie is a true story of racial tension and struggle in southern Georigia. It is a moving story that would have been wonderful to see a second time, but I guess that is not meant to be. Do not buy this movie expecting to see it through to the conclusion."
1,What they forgot to tell you,"I have not been able to work this highly rated software.Why? My Sony DCR HC-30 camera is not supported and the software does not work with it. What? How was I supposed to know that? Nowhere on the webstore does Cyberlink tell you to check to see if you DV camera is supported before you buy. This is a terrible case of the vendor wanting to sell-sell-sell without caring for whether or not you can use the product.Since Cyberlink is Taiwanese and the support is in India, I expect that I am stuck with this mess. I do not think that they care."
2,Will not Capture,"This is an ok program. It is NOT so easy to figure out! However, once you get used to some of it's features, you can make a dvd. Unfortunately, It constantly shuts down my camera and will not capture more than a few seconds of video. I have a brand new Dell XPS desktop. I am really furious. Their answer???!!! Use another program to capture the video...great...They offer NO phone support unless you pay for it. It is outrageous...I have no answers. If you want a more professional looking dvd, better wait until someone invents something easy to use that will do what it is supposed to do! Good Luck!"
1,Problems with PowerDirector 5,I would not recommend this program or upgrading from PowerDirector 3.0 to 5.0. The program hangs up when trying to load projects. It is slow to open and seems to have quite a few other issues. After Internet research on this program I have found many people who have experienced similar problems.
2,"First seems good, later sucks","It seems to be good and have everything, but later will slow down and give you glitches. Not as bad as pinacle studio 10 though."
2,power Director,The product will work okay for the automatic pan and zoom. It is very slow. The service is poor. I believe that almost everyone tries to fiend you off with Re-installing the software. That has never worked for me. Most never admit the software is flawed. I have Pinnacle Version 9.0 and it works well. I have not found any software that does everything I would like. I wind up using at least four different software packages to make a Wedding Video DVD.Jim Burnett
1,HORRIBLE PROGRAM!!,"Spent hours editing, then was never able to actually create DVD's. This program is full of bugs, after days of trying to create DVD's all that I received were errors. Horrible customer support. AVOID THIS PRODUCT AT ALL COSTS!!"
1,power director 5 is very bad,I have been a power director user for quite some time. I started out using PD 3 then 4 then 5 and the trouble started. PD5 WILL crash. It was unusable. It WILL crash for no reason. It is very frustrating to put in hours and hours on a project and then crash and lose all your data. I think it is time that Cyberlink fixes it's product once and for all or refunds it's customers their money.
3,Somebody in Cyberlink should be shot for using old DLLs.,"Somebody in Cyberlink should be shot for using old DLLs. I saw 2 old DLLs in the program directory, comctl32.dll and msvcp60.dll. Try copying these 2 dlls from your Windows directory and paste them into the PowerDirector directory. After I pasted these 2 DLLs, the program could at least load nicely. Don't know about crashes at other places.I am giving a middle score of 3 stars because I haven't played much with it yet. Just writing this message to help anyone reduce its possibility of crashing."
3,All were broken,"The taste is great, but so far every box we've opened has all broken breadsticks and a lot of crumbs. It was a bit of a waste."
