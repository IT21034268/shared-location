5,Awesome!,"These headphones are *great*. The quality is really good (better than the apple in-ear ones). They stay in my ear well too. When I play sports with them, the over-ear attachments keep it in place really well. The best earphones out there in this price-range!"
1,why does cord make noise???,"these suck ... pretty good sound if you stand perfectly still, if you plan to move around when listening to music the cord makes a rubbing noise that you hear from the headphones ... waste of money"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I am not an audiophile, but even my ignorant ears can tell that these earphones are awful. No bass, treble is piercing. The $10 earphones I bought from Target are much better. I am trying to return mine, but seller's policy does not allow - so don't take a chance on these!"
1,JBL Headphone (not good),"I found that the quality of this headphone to be worse than the set that came with my ipod. In order to get quality bass it had to be inserted far into the ear, and during physical activity (working out at the gym) it constantly became dislodged, causing the sound to be very tinny."
1,The worst IEM I could ever use,"Sorry for those who will certainly disagree with my review, but IMO this is the worst in ear monitor (monitor?) that I could ever try. Not even close to a flat response, too much mid range (close to 1K~2K), absolutely no bass response (strange, someone else claimed it has an over response on the bass range), it doesn't sound even like a cheap 10 bucks mini phone. I primary bought this as a substitute for the crappy phone that comes with the Apple IPod, but now I really regret this buy. I can think it's a faulty peace but I'm not able to return it as I'm not an US resident. It's a shame a faulty (or not) piece like this, with this terrible quality coming with the JBL logo on it."
1,Very surprising!,I am baffled by the sound quality of these. I love JBL products for their intense deep bass but these have absolutely no bass response at all. They lack any significant range of sound. The apple earbuds that came with my iPod are far better. The design is great and the case and accessories that come with the headphones are all really cool. I am not sure if my pair are just defective but I am now looking for something else and hoping I can get my money back for these.
4,GREAT!!,"for the price that you pay these are amazing, i have had them for like 2 weeks now, i have meany sets of headphones, bose, sony, and the jbl's are my fav so far. being in afgahanstan living with like 30 ppl in one opin bay they do great with cancaling the nose t that is around, with out having to have them blasting, the EQ's are well complimented and they are all in all gteat"
3,Just OK,"I had bought these headphones in Japan and fell in love with them. They lasted about a year with a lot of use at the gym. They stopped working I think because of overuse. Great sound but because of the material the wires are wrapped with, they give feedback into the headphones when rubbed together. I could not wait to buy another pair and when I was back in the states, I bought another set and they sound very different then the first set I had. The bass is jumbled and one side is not as clear as the other. I was very disappointed with the second set and wonder why the one I bought in Japan sounded so much better then the one here in the USA. Who knows but now they are just average headphones not worth the price."
2,Sound is off,"For some reason, the sound is muffled by the design of the headphone. I think it's the membrane that allows the sound to travel through and stops things from falling in the headphone. Not worth the money."
4,Failed after 6 months,"[original review Nov. 17, 2007] I'm not a huge fan of the fabric that surrounds the cord, but in a way it's good because it should be easier to clean. However, the headphones sound great and block out quite a bit of noise (can be good AND bad).[Update now after 6 months of having the earphones - 5/14/08]. Even though I tried very hard to keep the cord safe, they totally broke the other day. They are useless now. I can tell it's a broken connection near the plug. It must be because the wire is covered with fabric instead of plastic. Very annoyed that they only lasted 6 months and quit without notice (in the middle of a run!)"
2,bad quality of sound,I had a pair of senheizer and there's not comparison in the quality of sound. i definitely don't like it.
3,Too much cord noise!,Sound quality is great but these produce an extreme amount of noise when the wires touch anything. You can reduce this by folding the wire behind your ears but I found this too much trouble to setup. I ended up sending these back.
3,Not the report I expected,"This is not the report I had previously downloaded from NASA's web site (as a PDF) which was sent to the press. This is the internal NASA report and contains a lot of detailed data analysis and some good diagrams to help you understand what failed. It does not cover any of the work proactice problems or management descisions that are covered in the other report. One point I did note - 8 tools were lost reconditioning Columbia including three screwdrivers, two sockets and a mini flashlight. There are also several mentions of low bolt torque setting on closeout panels and other fittings. All in all not the report I wanted. The paper is average quality and printed on one side only. The pictures are OK but would be better if they were larger and on glossy paper. Would someone plase send me the report that NASA sent to the press? nigel-t@msn.com"
5,excellent knife,"I decided to purchase this knife after using it in a cooking class. I cook frequently, but never splurged on high quality knives. This knife is amazing! It's much lighter than many of the German brands like Wusthof and Henkels, but still cuts through food effortlessly. It also has an ergonomically correct handle, so it feels great in your hand. Oh, and not to mention, it's beautifully designed."
2,Quicktionary II,Pro: Does scan text well Con: translates one word at a time even though it scans a whole sentence. You have to figure out what the sentence means by piecing together the definitions of each individual word. This is difficult to do when you don't know the language you are trying to translate.
3,Small,"Appropriately lightweight, but this is smaller than I expected. Otherwise works well. Brings back the memories... A fun tradition to start with the kids."
1,Angel Chimes,I had one of these when I was a child. It was delicate and probably inexpensive. But this one that I just bought puts a new spin on delicate and inexpensive - it's called flimsy and cheap! This one doesn't even ring the chimes when the candles are lit - the angels hit the chimes but they don't make a sound. And the whole thing is made of such cheap material that it easily bends and dangerously wobbles - not a good thing to do with lit candles. But of course the one I had as a child - 60+- years ago - was made in America.
1,Review of Angel Chimes by Plow and Hearth,"Please do not put out your $10.00 for this Angel Chime. I grew up with Angel Chimes all around the house that my mother and father purchased and this does not even compare in anyway. It is the worse quality material I've seen and I could not even use it one time due to the bending of the metal.I woulc recommend you purchase any Angel/Santa Chime by the Original Swedish Design, much better."
5,Angel chimes,Family tradition. more than I expected with the other marry go round chimes. gave as gifts to my children can use year round
2,Flimsy Angel Chimes,"I remembered these from my childhood and I know they aren't the most robust thing in the world. However, these are ridiculously flimsy. They barely stand up straight. Additionally, the ""brass"" tone turned black once the candles were lit the first time."
2,Not great,"Looks alot nicer on box. Easy to assemble, however, top angel required crazy glue, as it did not readily fit in pre fashioned slots. It does work nicely, but overall, thought it was quite flimsy looking."
1,TERRIBLE piece of junk,"I grew up with one of these and loved it! I wanted my children to see how fun and magical it is. I always loved hearing those chimes. This is a piece of junk. The pieces are so flimsy and the angel on the top bent just from sitting up there. The center piece that holds everything up is so precarious and the little pieces that hold it in are so flimsy the piece starts tilting and then the angels don't hit the chimes. When you get everything bent the proper way and balanced and the angels do fly around and hit the chimes, you can barely hear it. The little bells are so thin they make almost no sound. The longer it sits there the more it starts bending to one side or another and then it stops working. There is no way this will last more than this season - I'm hoping it stays in one piece for at least a couple weeks."
1,Cheaply made,I had this same chime as a child. This item is made in China. There are not sufficient assembly directions and the metal bends very easily in your hands so that it is like putting together something made of foil. Not worth the money and very disappointing.
1,Different item sent. Very poor quality,"I ordered this chime after doing a little research to make sure I was going to receive a quality item, supposedly made in Turkey, not made in China. What I received is a very flimsy product, made in China. The angel at the top does not stay on,the moving angels touch the chimes but also the star which kills the pleasure of the chime sound. In order to get the chime to work, I had to superglue the ""falling"" angel to the top and the stand to the plate..., which means that I will not be able to take it apart to store it easily. There was a lot of complication with the seller who claims that Amazon is responsible for the mix-up and that there was no misrepresentation on his part. To be fair, I was given a full refund on the product, but I still believe it is unethical to send an item that is not the one described on the web site, particularly to replace it with such a bad product."
5,Beautiful,"I had angel chimes like this when I was a child and I was delighted to find this. It went together easily (came with pictured instructions) and even included the candles, which other ones I've seen don't always."
4,very satisfied,After reading several reviews I was hesitant to order this because other reviews said they werecheaply made. But I was very satisfied. It has to be thin metal or it wouldn't turn with just acandle flame. I love it!
5,A talent deserving wider recognition,"Anyone who likes Peter Cincotti, Michael Buble, Michael Feinstein, Matt Bogart, Adam Pascal and Harry Connick, should check out Steven Kowalczyk's ""Moods and Grooves"". This album came out in 1995 and it was produced by Ahmet Ertegun. This guy composed all the songs in the album save for ""Polka Dots and Moonbeams."" He has this innate feel for jazz and his voice is a showier Peter Cincotti, with a less heavy drone unlike Connick and he also has this fragile upper registers when reaching for that high note. Matt Bogart and Adam Pascal may perfect that but Kowalczyk reaches your heart faster.He is now known as Steven Santoro and teaches at Berklee and may have another album soon, but that doesn't mean you should not get his underrated 1995 album when he was still Kowalczyk."
3,Gave good Idea of every day life in NFL,He explained the day to day life in the NFL. The hard work and pain. The fun and excitement. Those people that lived during the Packers Lombardi era will appreciate this book.
5,This is splendid,"Fish ! was an exciting book that no doubt brought in a fresh perspective to light up our lives at work. Pike Place Fish Market ranks # 1 among the places that I would like to visit during my lifetime. Mary Jane , Lonnie and the kids now seem to have become a part of our own family. In this book, there is a happy homecoming for Grandma too.Frankly, this book is the next logical extension of the author's first book Fish!. It brings the powerful philosophy from workplaces to our homes. Written in very simple words, the frankness and the depth of conversations between Lonnie and Mary Jane have the power to change the way we live at home. The Fish! philosophy can work wonders at home as much as it can at the workplace.Read this book aloud with the family, ten pages a day and experience the joy of living . Thanks Stephen, my family joins me in thanking you for this wonderful book. We are grateful to Fish! and are committed to adopt it at home."
4,inspiring and practical read!,"I really liked this book. Written in a similar style to the fantastic 'Serendipity's Secret' the practical learning points are woven around a hearwarming story. It is very simply written and very easy to apply the learning points to improve your life and to make instant improvements. The only reason I didn't give it an extra star is that, unlike Serendipity's Secret, it just lacks that extra spark to make me think 'that was amazing!'. Maybe it's because the family involved in the story didn't quite capture my imagination the way that Serendipity and Pollyanna did in 'Serendipity's Secret' and, although I was glad the story ended on a postive note, I wasn't left greatly moved the way I was at the end of 'SS' Nevertheless, if you want a quick, uplifting read with simple, practical steps to improve your life this is, in my view, one of the better self-help books around."
3,Hmmm not much to say,"This book is not bad, but just a little predictable the story is not bad either, but I have read better stories. It seems that the book is short, and missing the heart of the writer, I DID NOT READ any other fish! books but I don't think I'll find a lot of differences. If you have never read inspirational books before, this is a good one to start with."
1,Author should take a course in creative writing,"I gave up the struggle to get through the book halfway through. The cliches killed me. The writer must be a 15 year old high school boy based on the lack of style and large number of trite expressions. ""Racoon faced""? Give me a break. Finish high school English before trying to write another book.The story itself was so-so, I'd give it 2 stars, maybe 2 1/2 if I was generous."
2,So-so story,"I put the book down a third of the way through. I was bored. The story is so-so, not really worth spending the time to finish.If I'm going to read a work of fiction I'd rather read a better novel. The 'good guys' weren't worth rooting for, and the bad guys were the usual mix. Ho hum."
2,"Lite read, moderately entertaining if you have nothing else","I found this book abandoned at an airport, whenI was stuck during a long layover. Normailly I wouldn't have read it but I had nothing else on hand.Parts were mildly entertaining and it helped to pass the time. Better than just sitting and staring out the window for hours. I skipped over the boring spots and hunted for the action.I'd stick to Mario Puzo if you want good gangster reading."
5,Dutchman's Gold,I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. It is a page turner of the first order. It is a cross between Mel Brooks and Sam Spade. The book has more turns than a maze yet with a relentless amounts of action and tense moments. A wonderful first effort from this new author.
5,This book is surely worth the money!,"This book is surley worth the money for any kind of flight simmer out there. This guide covers all kinds of different issues not included in the flight manual that came with the game. My one tip would be that if you have the game, Buy THIS BOOK!!! I'm not joking!"
4,definitely useful,"while the campaigns are dynamically generated, they do include a number of ""special"" missions, the guide does an excellent job guiding you through those.I would have liked a little more help on general tips and techniques, especially for the kiowa and blackhawk, but overall a very useful book."
3,Fairly useful tips book,"Because the game uses a dynamic engine to generate campaigns, the book cannot include the usual 'walk-through' (or how to win each mission). It does provide tips for staying alive, and walk-throughs for the single missions and some 'special' missions that may appear in the campaign. Most useful are the statistical tables giving weapons strength, range and so on."
4,Patient people might like this book.,"If you like a detailed, psychological analysis of love and family relationships, then this is a book for you. You need a while to get into Maria's writing style. His style is not the most readable - a sentence can be a page long. After you get used to the sentence legths, it is a great book to read. The plot is well presented with surprising flash-backs and time intervals. I started to really enjoy the book in the middle chapters. From then on the pace of narration is much faster and interesting coincidences makes you curious about what might come next. The final scene is gripping and very emotionally engaging. Overall a very intelligent book."
4,"Powerful, European in nuance","A rather straightforward story line, creatively structured, unraveled slowly through nuance, sexual enticement, digressions, reversals, repetition, and thought provoking writing causing one to become intrigued by its intrinsic mosaic beauty."
1,When the author's pedantry drowns the reader's interest.,"This must be the most pedantic, long-winded and self-absorbed piece of fiction I've encountered in over two decades. I for one can't begin to fathom the cause for rejoice expressed by other reviewers. I found the novel to be wanting in good character developement, basic narrative skills and overflowing with an embarrasing sense of conceit and narcisistic self-admiration that bordered on the ludicrous. There was something very adolescent to the tone of this pompose, pretentious book that seemed to want desperately to convince us of how smart the author was. By the end I was far from convinced of that, and would have rather see the author work harder at some basic aspects of style, structure and character. Before you become a prima donna at least you should be able to sing."
4,Interesting book by Spanish novelist,"The third novel by Javier Marias I read. But the subject matter is more or less the same of ""Tomorrow in the battle think on me"" : a ysterious death and how to deal with a secret. Sometimes Marias lingers too much on certain ideas, but as a whole the book is well written and masterly constructed. Also contains a very satirical view on the role of translators in international politics !"
1,Heart So Depressing,"Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. I reached page 204 and can move no further, for if I come across one more simile, I might blow my freakin' brain out of my cabeza, or jump off of a really high object. Alas, the one positive note is that this book inspired me to fall into the work of an artist whom I love: Georges Bataille. Let me say this too: I don't read much contemporary literature; I was told that this was a great work of contemporary literature; I'll stick to a nostalgia for the works that were written when writers could actually write--thank you very much. I was truly floored by the emptiness of this piece; funny how a book can waste one's time."
5,Excellent rules for competing in the bridge auction,When to overcall and when to make a takeout double. Excellent rules for responding to takeout doubles and for making overcalls above the one-level.
3,Up & Over,"For about six weeks in 1980 WHFS in Washington DC, then a great progressive radio station, loved Pearl Harbor & The Explosions. Hard as it is to believe now, songs like ""Drivin'"" and ""Shut Up And Dance"" sounded progressive way back when.But it's 23 years further on down the road and this record sounds...well, 23 years old. The guitars sound a lot less edgy, the bass sounds suspiciously disco at times, and the songwriting is a lot more mundane than it seemed when I was in highschool.""Drivin'"" and ""Up and Over"" are still great fun, though."
3,amazon falls short,i think my issue is .. i would like to use amazons mp3 down load and the few songs i want from peral are not available ( thats crap) so i have to buy a poppy scratched album and play and transfer it to mp3 .. it's 2011 get with it and stop the blocking certain songs... not sure if it's pearl or amazon who is creating the proplem... thx.
3,Good but not for me,I bought this cream for my husband. he has psoriasis and it really was not helpfull for him. However the texture of the cream is great so we are using it as a regular cream
3,Rumpole for the Defence,"Rumpole for the Defence, as read by Patrick Tull, is great! Unfortunately Patrick Tull's readings no longer seem to be in circulation. The reader for this set of cd's has a grating voice which is hard to listen to. Ouch!"
2,Hoped for more than this!,"I bought this DVD based on the one and only review wrote here. I really hoped there's going to be something big in it. Especially after seeing that all who bought Banned from TV & America's Funniest Uncensored bought this DVD as well. But to tell you the truth it was disapointing!Ok yes some celebs where worth catching on this DVD... but in most parts it is boring plus you cannot see it more than once! So maybe it's worth renting it but not buying it!In the end, you see that celebs do deserve privacy of their own and any of us if we were in their shoes we'd be very frustrated.The best part is of Pamela Anderson & Her Ex..! There are so many celebs that I wanted to see where not in this DVD...In other words, don't hold your breath!"
5,A Miracle in a Bottle,"This stuff is liquid gold to me. I am allergic to practically everything and can't take OTC remedies for my sinusitis, night-time cough, and hay fever. My nose drips like a faucet 24/7 unless I use expensive industrial strength nasal spray and it is expensive and doesn't always work. If I take a small sip of this, the dripping goes away and so does the dry hacking cough, sneezing, etc. I don't know what I would do without it. If you are sensitive to OTC products, you owe it to yourself to try this. Absolutely NO side effects!!!"
1,No Actual Medicine in the Bottle,"Wife picked this up because they go out of their way to make the package look like normal cough syrup (i.e. Robitussin). Turns out this is just homeopathic magic hippy water, and each dose contains no actual molecules of decongestant or expedient.If you really like sugar water, or want to explore the placebo effect, this is the product for you. Otherwise order a cough syrup that will actually do something."
2,Sandisk CF cards are mediocre,"Although a good steal at this price, I would recommend against this card if you were in dire need of speed. This card scored very poorly in the ratings of other cards. I initially thought it would be good to get in on a cheap deal, since this card is cheaper than the other ones. However, since I got the item, I've noticed that it's slower than my other cards, much slower. According to dpreview.com, this card only shows a 14x read (2,085 KB/s) and a measly 6x write (855 KB/s)! If you have one of the newer cameras, like the canon powershot s230, I'd recommend against it! Also, if you had a dell axim or ipaq, you'll notice the speed difference immediately when you try to upload programs on to the card!Ok for people with like to wait, and people who just want storage not speed, but I'd pay the extra money just for the faster speeds offered by kingston, simpletech or viking.If you like sandisk, their ultra series are much better."
5,Works great!,I use this with my new Canon PowerShot G3 and it seems to work great! No complaints and I can hold 500 pics at a time!
5,works great,"I use the sandisk 512 as memory for a Fostex digital multitrack recorder. Even though the Fostex web site says it is not compatible with sandisk cards, it has worked perfectly."
1,seriously annoyed,"This card is on its way back to Amazon. I purchased it as it was one of the ""recommended items"" with the camera I also purchased, never mind that it doesn't work with the camera. I'm not hugely tech savvy--I (wrongly) assumed that any items recommended with the main item (a $500 camera) would be compatible. Check to make sure that any recommended accessories will actually achieve what you want them to."
3,Not for all cameras,"Maybe this is obvious to most Amazon customers, but not being ""technically inclined"" I read up on these and thought I was getting the right product to fit my new digital camera, but it arrived and I quickly realized it was too big and I had to return it. The return process, however, was quick and painless."
1,sent wrong card,1 of Canon Powershot SD500 7MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom by Canon [Electronics]--I purchased this =camera--was advised to purchase the above Card--(Card was recommended to go with the camera on Amazon website)--which I did--the card does not fit the SD500 camera--was a waste of money and time
1,SanDisk used to be good but no longer,"Every year, I purchase hundreds of Compact Flash memory cards for a product that my company manufactures.SanDisk used to be one of my top brands for reliability. No longer.My last purchase was 10 CF cards, 7 of them failed. This is not just bad luck, over the last two years the failure rate went from less than 1% to this peak of 70%.The failure rate averages about 40% in the short term, the long term has more of them fail.We had to write a compact flash card testing program to eliminate the bad cards. One or two errors is no big deal because the software corrects for that but these cards have hundreds of errors.I will stick with Simpletech or Crucial CF cards. They typical test without any errors on them.Do yourself a favor and don't buy SanDisk !"
4,SanDisk Is Reliable,"This card has been working great for me so far after over a month of heavy use.512 MB is more than enough space for anyone with a 5 MB or less camera, assuming you transfer photos off your camera fairly regularly and are not shooting hundreds of photos at a time. With the 1200x1600p setting I use on my camera most often, this card holds over 400 photos, and it will hold even more for those using a more email-friendly setting. Do the math to figure out if 512 is the number for you, but I've had no problems with SanDisk products."
3,Kotler journal writings are more interesting,The book was just okay. Kotler's business industry and journal writings are much more insightful and interesting. Too basic for marketing practicioners.
1,Not a true PR book,"This book is one of an increasingly common genre: the marketing book in PR clothing. Essentially, the author claims that to ""add value"" to public relations, the latter should be turned into marcomm. I found the author's condescending tone to be extremely grating, and his suggestions superficial.It's a matter of outlook, I suppose, but if you are interested in a relational approach to PR, this book is a huge disappointment. If you are interested in the field of marketing communication, you probably won't hate this book nearly as much as I did."
2,Not an Internet Book,"I suppose this book is valuable if you are in Public Relations, or want to learn more about that field. However, I was looking for something more related to the Internet and CRM, and this is not it."
5,Tim is tha man!,I've met Tim several times and is amazing live. This album is a great find and very underated. He is very underated as a performer and I was glad to see reviews for him. He is honestly an inspiration in my life and will continue to be.-Kwesi (Eric's Nephew)
1,Arrived damaged and late,"This item arrived marked up and late, even though they charge insane shipping fees. I needed to return it because it was way too large. It's been over 3 months since I returned it. I should have just thrown it in the trash, between both shipping fees. This vendor is horrible and I will never order from them again. I gave it one star but it really is less than one star."
5,Excellent but not as durable,"Children loved it right out of the box. The graphics, the story and the rules were simple and fun. Game ends quite quickly and keeps children involved. I wish the cards were a little durable..."
4,Nothing new,"Each year, the calendars for GWTW are reprints of photos used in previous years and this is no exception. The calendars themselves are lovely, but unless you're a collector and not expecting to find anything new, you will be disappointed. I am a collector of GWTW items, so I'm satisfied."
4,Tiempo de soledad,"Tiempo muerto se sirve de las voces entrelazadas de varios narradores para explorar los rincones más escondidos de papabuelo, un inmigrante afro-británico en la República Dominicana maltratado por la vida y por los años que huye de su soledad. Aunque la vida de papabuelo está llegando a su fin, sus recuerdos permanecen vivos en su nieta, Mariita, y con esta tranquilidad el alma de papabuelo puede por fin descansar. La lucha imposible de papabuelo por conseguir un lugar en la sociedad dominicana, y por extensión, la lucha de todos los cocolos como él, que para muchos pudiera parecer tiempo muerto, se rescata del olvido gracias a este emotivo y enigmático homenaje."
2,Poor editing and organization,"My rating would have been higher. However, there are typos, errors, and poor editing. It also could have been better organized. I would have also liked to read accounts of more close family members. Maybe they chose not to participate. As for the content, I found it very interesting, especially the accounts of the musicians who played with her. I think it provided more insight into Dinah Washington than the encyclopedic Nadine Cohodas book (which, although well-researched, is a cold recitation of Dinah's shows and appearances)."
5,Queen of the Blues: A Biography of Dinah Washington,"I love it when there are still honest people around! The book has a little tear, or so....but the seller refunded me $1.95! I still don't see the damage but I love any kind of blessing!"
5,Genius,"Everything about this album is brilliant. The noise, the drones, the interesting textures, and the overall unlistenable quality of the musick; re: Tunnel of Goats.This is an absolute joy to play at softer and maximum volumes.Highly recommended for the noise and drone enthusiasts.AWESOME!"
2,literally unlistenable,This album is typical of most of Coil's work--underproduced garage recording done over a single weekend.They have four GOOD works. Everything else is either AWFUL or AVERAGE.They standouts are-- 1. Musick to Play in the Dark vol. 1 2. Musick to Play in the Dark vol. 2 3. Astral Disator 4. Black Light District
4,A source of information on life,"Although the book takes a very specific focus on a particular practice it allows you to deduce much between the lines.After getting used to the strange, not very pretty style of the book it becomes a source of information which falls into the category of ""Everything you have always wanted to know and there was nobody there to tell you"". Whether the book achieves what it suggests, which is to abolish religion through logic I don't know, but it certainly helped me to think."
5,Great item!,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that this item was very well made and that the rods, that support the cups, are put into the rack with screws vs. nails.The holders that I replaced had to be replaced because the rods were put in with nails. And, with age, those nails became very loose and were no longer safe to hang the cups on. I expect these replacement racks to last a lot longer due to their excellent construction.Good value. Highly recommended!"
3,cute glasses...but not 10 inches...,"These are really cute and colorful glasses, but the title says 10 inch tumblers, when it should be 10oz tumblers. Makes a big difference! They can not be stacked due to their shape. But overall, these are nice tumblers and kids love the colors!"
2,bad shape,"Love this line of dishes, but really wish they had kept the cup shape simple and stackable. The colors and textures are fun enough, do not need the strange shape. Very hard to store in cupboards. Please make regular shape cups Zak!"
1,Not worth the $$$$,"Not worth the money!! They are way too small, they don't stack. I'd return them but it's not worth it to pay shipping.UPDATE: Not only are they small, they break when little hands drop them. We once had a six pc set and now it's four. I was thinking about getting the bowls for my son and daughter but after seeing how they shatter. I wouldn't dare waste the money."
4,I Read This Book Twice,It took some searching to find this book on-line. I read it twice because it didn't 'stick' in my pea brain the first time through; too many distractions at the time. This story had a slow start but I liked the way it built and evolved. The characters were forgettable. I'm glad Perry didn't stick with them for subsequent storylines. The Big Fish tale is not up there with the Jane Whitefield series but a worthwhile read nevertheless. I passed it along on paperbackswap.com and I hope it is still making the rounds as it is out of print.
3,Right Part -- but not for export Jeep's,"I bought this because I had to replace my headlight on my Jeep here in England. I figured a headlight is a headlight. Not so, over here they use all glass enclosures, not plastic with different bulbs. Too bad, because to buy one for an expert is more than $150.00 for a used one. Talk about rediculous."
5,Great Product,"My old 98 Jeep Grand Cherokee headlights needed to be replaced bad, using the restoration products didn't work and even the sanding technique didnt work. went to my local Autozone and O'Reilly Auto parts stores needed to have the headlights ordered, and they were 60 bucks a piece. decided to take a shot and purchase these headlights I couldnt be happier they came packaged good and the bulbs were included installed them on my truck looks much cleaner and im very surprised on how bright the lights are."
2,Buy a better quality product,"The product was just as described and, for the price you pay, the product does provide a nice beam of light. However, upon installation, you can follow all instructions about installing to a T and the plastic clips will still break. Despite my efforts to gingerly install the product knowing that others experienced the issue with the clips breaking, all but one clip broke on the headlights. I will be purchasing a better quality product to install in the near future. Spend a bit more and buy a better quality product, bottom line.."
4,Going to be great!,I am writing this review before it came out but I still think it is going to be a good computer game. I want to buy this game because I like basketball and maybe it will improve my skills. I think so because I have Backyard Soccer and it sort of improved my soccer skills. If you're a basketball lover like me I think you should get this game. I hope this review was helpful to you.
2,Bad controls- can't say I liked it,"This game is the 7th and worst of the Backyard Series games. It seems to me like they rushed this product to the market. I really liked the other backyard games better. The main problem with this game would be the controls. It is virtually impossible to play defense. There are many glitches to the game also. There is limited saving(only to season games)If I were you, I'd stick with Backyard Football 2002 or Backyard Baseball 2001- my favorites."
2,add more please,backyard basketball is okay but it lacks so many things. For one it's way to easy. Second not enough pro players you can just take all the pro's if there was more it would be harder. Third no pro teams it would be better with pro teams so then it would be at least a little bit realilistic.
1,Game doesn't work for XP as stated,"The description for this item is incorrect! Purchased the game to play on machines running Windows XP. The game does NOT work on XP. Tried the game on numerous machines running Windows XP...it does NOT work. Sad. If it's like the other ""Backyard"" games we have, it would've been fun to play."
2,not a good software,"I enjoy the backyard series, but backyard basketball is disappointing. It dosen't include enough pro players, the power-ups are terrible, and the season is too long."
2,ok,"This game has fun gameplay, but could be more realistic. You can hit a 3-pointer, half-court shot, and whole court shot almost every single time! And anyone can dunk, and just tell me, HOW CAN A KID IN A WHEEL-CHAIR DUNK!!!! These kids shouldn`t be able to hit EVERY SINGLE shot!!!! Some of these people make every 3-pointer they shot. I was doing training, and I was Dimitri Petrovich, and I was shooting half-court shots, and when I finally reached 236 in a row, I just decided to quit. Like come on, no one in real life could do that. You can buy it from me if you want, and i`ll give you a free cd case too for getting this THING and WASTE-OF-TIME out of my life. DONT BUY!!!!!!!"
4,basketball bash,This game will exite you and amaze you.There are fun killer basket ball courts and two pro basketball players Lisa Leslie and Kevin Garnet.Even have your whole team of customs.After the game the player of the game will be talked to and see the rewards they get.One tip pick Kevin Garnet.There's weird teams to pick through and even make your own team.If your looking for a good and fun game this is it!!!
4,Not bad.,"This is a pretty good game. The graphics aren't to shabby, but they aren't as good as NBA Live 2002 or NBA 2k2. The game play is cool, but the controls feel a little weird."
1,The Most Horrable Thing You Can Buy,This is a really bad software. We had to return this CD twice! It alwayse stalls and I got in troble because this CD almost crashed our computer!DO NOT BUY
3,PRETTY GOOD,THIS GAME I WOULD HAVE TO SAY IS NOT THE BEST WORK AND A LITTLE DISSAPOINTING BUT IT IS A GOOD GAME THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE PRO PLAYERS BUT DUNKS R TIGHT. MY FAVORITE IS TYIPING IN THE CREATED PLAYER BARRY DEJAY OR LEMON BOY THEY R FOR MORE AWSOME SOIF U LOVE BASKETBALL GET IT IF U DON'T CARE U JUST WANT IT WAIT AND COME UP WITH A WISE DESCION 2 STARZ R JUST FOR THE AWSOME BARRY DEJAY AND LEMON BOY. THIS GAME HAS DECENT GRAPHICS. ALL IN ALL A GOOD GAME.
4,Basketball At It's Best,Backyard Basketball is and excellant game. Not enough dunks but a fun game for kids.
3,way too easy.,"Don't get me wrong though, I like this game. But even the hard level is child's play. However, this game is designed for kids 5-10. I like it, but it is too easy. My best game so far was 132-12. I think that even a 5 year old wouldn't have a problem kicking everyone's butt in this game. Its fun, and anyone who likes the other Backyard games (hockey, soccer, football, baseball) will like this one.Pros:- Very simple controls- Not hard for little kids- No offensive content (it is, however, targeted to younger persons)Cons:- Way too easy for older gamers (e.g. 9-12)- Gets stale and repetative after awhileAltogether this is a good game, but if you are over age 9, this one will be way too easy and you shouldn't get it. Otherwise, you will like this one. It's fun, just too easy, which is why the younger audience will like it."
2,a below-average game,"I own all of the backyard games, and this is byfar the worst. It has bad gameplay and is completely revolved around the fast-break. It is also impossible to play defense or rebound. Also, you cannot play as real NBA or WNBA teams such as in the other Backyard Games. Also, there are only 2 pro players (Kevin Garnett and Lisa Leslie). So unless you are a hardcore gamer under 10 with a good temper (because this game will get really annoying after a while) dont waste your money on it. Spend it on the new Backyard Game, Backyard Baseball 2003 (which is a great game)."
3,Ok Game.,"This is a fun game just it makes my computer slow down. It also gets pretty boring after about a month. I already beat the wholegame. The good thing about this game is that you can make a whole custom player team. None of the other backyard sports games have that. It is really easy. If you are a basketball fan you'll love this game. If you don't really like basketball, stay away from it and don't think about buying it."
1,Bad Basketball,Trust me this game is not worth it. You will get tired with it really quick. Sure maybe the other backyard games are cool but this one [stinks]. I wanted to get it so bad and I couldn't wait till Christmas and I spent my own money then it was dissapointing!!Don't buy it!! I repeat dont buy it!!!!!
4,Backyard Basketball is Tops,"This game is not too hard. I haven't gotten too far, but I can tell it's really great. I would recommend this game if you're not familiar with backyard sports, beacuse I brushed my way through most of it. Try checking this game out."
4,backyard basketball,"I'm ""MoneyMan"", a registered online coach at humongoussports.com, and as a registered coach i can play ""backyard"" games online. I haven't bought the game yet, but was very disapointed to find out that this game nor Backyard Football 2002 didn't have online play. I was very happy though to find out that it had more descriptive create-a-player options, pro players, and specific options. My fellow Backyard gamers updated me on the game, and I found that it was not as good as I expected. This game was what everyone was waiting for at ""The Sidelines"", the Humongous Sports messageboard, before it was unexpectedly shut down for a second time. To find out it had limited saving options and no online play was a bad start. However, finding awesome graphics and great play-by-play and other options was a big plus. Overall, I think I will be happy enough with this game."
2,Pointless and Sloppy.,"Cute art by Jamie Hewlett can't offset the awful writing of Alan Martin. The stories themselves are pointless and meandering, and the ""Brit-icisms"" mostly went right over my head. Tank Girl herself is cute, and the adventures of the foul-mouthed, beer-swilling, Kangaroo-shagging minx roaming the futuristic Aussie Outback are fun at times, but mostly just pointless and sloppy. I'm kicking myself not only for buying THIS, but for buying Volume 2 before I read 1."
5,The Very Essence of Awesomeness,"This is one case in which it's okay to judge a book by its cover. Seriously, the most amazing comic I have ever read, the very definition of awesome."
3,comic anarchy,"tank girl is the chronicles of a post apocalyptic beer-swilling punk-chic tank commander and the crew of misfits shes friends with. the motley crew includes, jet girl and sub girl, booga (tank girl's mutant kangaroo boyfriend), and stevie the surfer aborigonee. the art is really wild and imaginative but somewhat uneven, sometimes its really good and sometimes the characters look extremely crudely drawn. the plot is nonexistant and the comic relies heavily on slapstick, swearing, booze and extreme violence coupled with silliness, but it works. its a genre piece aimed at hipsters and punk kids but i like it."
3,Fun read,"Tank Girl is the name of a female survivour who travels around in the post apocalyptic Australia. On her adventurers she runs into various odd fellows(In this book she even meets the devil!) The comic is rarely takes itself serious, and the artwork is pretty fun to look at. Many small funny details."
1,Just a bunch of clips of other movies.,"There is something important for all prospective buyers to know. ""Bimbo Movie Bash"" is not an actual movie, per se. It is entirely made up of clips of other movies spliced together.Most, and perhaps all, of the movies were brought to us by Full Moon Entertainment. Some of the films which have segments contained in this movie are such infamous B-flicks as ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"", ""Beach Babes From Beyond"" and ""Assault of the Killer Bimbos"".Some parts of the movie are nothing more than lifting entire scenes from other movies. Other parts are slightly altered. For example, the background music might have been changed or a narrator might make a snide comment a la MST3000 (but not nearly as funny).Please don't think that you are buying a ""new"" movie and please, please don't think you are buying anything funny. It's very dull to watch this stuff for almost an hour and a half."
1,Bad!,"The target audience for this film is a group of stoned teenagers on Saturday night. If you don't meet the match, then skip the ""film"""
1,Do not waste your money buying this movie!,The best parts of the movie are the previews! Please avoid this movie it is stupid so stupid!
5,"After a 250point inspection,this is CERTIFIED TALENT.","I must say i recently discovered this artist during an extensive research of one my favourite producer(DAVID FOSTER).I knew right away that any artist associated with him atlease can hold a note.Guess what i was right, Jordan Hill is one of the few modern day female singers that can really sing.I will ask that all fair minded and patriotic Americans begin to investigate why this wonderful singer(JORDAN HILL)did not achieve the same level of success as all the other non-talented female singers of her generation.Lets begin by calling our congresional representatives,the music industry,media,holliwood...lets dig up some dirt,make some waves..this wonderful artist deserves it."
5,simply amazing,"In response to many of your questions, Jordan is currently writing new songs in Nashville right now. There will be a dvd of her coming out in the next month or two and as far as a second album, I expect it to be out either later on this year or next year. Just know that she will use the name Riley Jae."
5,looking for a new cd,I check back periodically to check on Jordan Hill's list of cds. Why is this woman not producing more music. She is awesome beyond words. Her voice is great! I've had this cd for ages and I still enjoy it. Please make another cd. I can't believe you're not a major star. I heard Jordan Years...ago on our local radio station 99.1 KGGI and I ran out to find this cd. Where's the music?
4,Dino costume,"This costume is great. My daughter wore it for Halloween, and she has worn it almost everyday since, and hasn't worn it out yet. It has survived several trips through the washing machine!"
5,I heard that death by drowning is euphoric...,"This album is dark man, but this darkness has life, like some kind of ugly/beautiful coma pillow. Fans of doom metal of the ""gothic"" variety (pretty keyboards weaving throughout the riffs that go from slow to slower to almost not slow) have heard this before, but somehow these guys make it their own. I feel compelled to play it over and over again, I keep hearing new things. Gruff vocals are pitched slightly from time to time, going from rumble to screech with a touch of clean, which keeps things vital. Sounds great at 3 in the morning...the cover of the album conveys this vibe nicely. The bonus Candlemass cover is a nice indication of where they're coming from as well-it's always good to see a band salute the root. Recommended for those who like to take baths in the dark, or maybe just those who would rather sleep than talk to most people."
3,Doom meets Death - 3 1/2 stars,"Not bad, not bad at all. Tempos and drive are mostly doom-like, but plenty of catchy bits and changes to make things more interesting. (Much better song-writing than most doom albums I've heard!) Lots of great guitar crunch, death vocals and awesome use of synth and piano in a metal context. In fact, great playing all-round, nothing to criticise there. It reminds me of Rapture's ""Songs for the withering"", except slower tempos - that's another one for the ""must have"" list. Hey, there's even a few teasing moments of clean vocals for Opeth-style fans, in fact I would have given an extra 1/2 star for even more of that! :) Buy with confidence!"
4,Finland rules you worthless Americans,"Yeah I'm American too so spare me the hate mail. This is some dark-ass doom, man. Finland rules again."
4,My first Smith,"This is the very firts Smith novel I read and it has made me look for more of his writings.This book starts in America and ends in a war turn country Zimbabwe. In my thought it teaches the lesson of long lasting friendships which are forged by steel bonds. It tells of betrayal and what the human spirit is able to achive when faced with life and dealth situations. It has a fast pace from start to finish with all the neccesary pause for breath calculated to the last degree. Immegine you have go overseas to study and on your return to find the land (your home), changed by the conflict of men and his politics, place your self in that point and think about it real hard."
4,Great Study Book,"This is a great book for all types of study environments. It is good for small groups with study questions for each chapter. It is also great for personal study of the basic tenants of Christianity. In easy to understand language, Paul Little covers the foundational aspects of the Christian faith. I currently use this book in the development of new leaders in our church."
4,good read,Great information. Easy to read and understand yet illuminating. Goes along brilliantly with Know Why You Believe.A must for every Christian library.
5,Great Read!,"A board member at Biola University recommended this book, to supplement my bible reading. I found this book to be very relevant and instructional. I highly recommend anyone who is searching for clarity and meaning of the Christian faith, to read this book."
3,Idea Book,"The book is based on a great idea, using memory pegs to remember Spanish words.Some of these are really good while others are not. You would be better off to usethe idea but make up your own."
5,muy bueno!,"I enjoy Jerry Lucas' material. It is fun, creative, andeffective.The material was delivered in a timely manner."
2,"Frankly, I'm astonished at you people","As much as I wanted to adore these guys, I can't help but feeling they're sitting back and laughing at all the pretentious idiots who think this music is good. This is like an irritating joke on Saturday Night Live that just goes on and on and on....and isn't funny.Performance art to irritate the masses? If so, well done!"
2,Past regrets,"The kind of obnoxiously edgy indie debut that can eventually make ya blush with disgust, Mirror unfortunately had just enough bite to get noticed. Pathetically produced, laughable vocals ripping off either Television or The Cure do not compliment these mediocre garage druggie compositions well. Somehow though, when not concentrating too hard, rough edges shine through, and the album almost becomes honest, before veering off again and as usual confirming my past ""musical edginess"" shame."
4,Straight up action,"This book started off with a bang and continued on in that same vein. It was almost one action scene after another. Some of the scenes were a tad on the ""ooh gross"" side, but aside from that, the book was pretty good. Unfortunately, I listened to this book on an abridged audio tape so a good portion of the book was cut out. And in some cases, you could tell where scenes were missing. But aside from that, the book was enjoyable."
2,Better As a Movie Than a Book,"I read this book for two reasons. First, I read Keanu Reeves was negotiating to play the lead in the film version. Then I came across the book again. Two times in one week; so I decided I should read it. Having just finished the lyrical descriptive style in ""Cold Mountain,"" going to Thayer's minimalist sentences was like shock therapy, food without spice. As a tale teller, Thayer's constructed a tight suspenseful plot. As a novelist, his style is bare bones. I think White Star could make an excellent screenplay. The love interest seems more obligatory than inspired and it's action-packed. As a novel, it's okay."
3,Entertaining book but unbelievable,"I really enjoyed Thayer's book, Terminal Event, that prompted me to buy this attempt at dramatization of an ex-Marine Corps Sniper going one-on-one with an ex-Ruskie Sniper. White Star is an entertaining read but the supposed physical stamina of the players is a bit much for me. The final duel is, shall we say, unbelievable, especially when one considers the geriatrics involved. Both snipers where in Vietnam back 1969, so do the math. I would love to hear what real ex-Marine Corps Snipers have to say about this book. Thayer can do better which he proved in Terminal Event."
1,Unrealistic and totally unbelievable.,"James Thayer has clearley not spent too much time in the woods, if ever at all. As an avid outdoorsman, I find his depiction of the wilderness contradictory at best, and unrealistic at worst. Apparently the author knows nothing of firearms, specifically military firearms. His description of the story's hero, Owen Gray, holding the WOODEN stock of a modern Marine Corps M40A1, is laughable, as all current USMC sniper rifles have composite stocks. Finally, none of the characters are believable or even sympathetic. Don't waste your time on this one. If you want to read an excellent fictional book about a former Marine sniper, check out Stephen Hunter's Point of Impact. If you want to read about the real thing, check out ""One Shot, One Kill"", which is about Gny, Sgt. Carlos Hathcock, an American hero from the Vietnam war, with 93 confirmed kills."
4,Fun Action,"""White Star"" (1995) is the story of Owen Gray, the most successful military sniper in American history. Now an assistant district attorney in New York, Gray is trying resolutely to put the past behind him; he never wants to see a rifle again. But a relentless sniper is stalking New York a step behind him, striking from uncanny distances. The sniper's objective: to draw Gray into a duel to see who is truly the best man.I can't decide whether I like ""White Star"" better than Stephen Hunter's ""Point of Impact,"" another novel whose protagonist was one of the best Marine snipers in Vietnam. Both Thayer and Hunter know an incredible amount about rifles, although Hunter spends more time on detail, often boring detail. ""White Star"" seems more plausible than ""Point of Impact"" (although not much), yet ""Point of Impact"" was more intense."
1,"Unrealistic, Unbelievable, and Poorly Written","James Thayer has clearley not spent too much time in the woods, if ever at all. His descriptions of the wilderness ring completely false. As an avid outdoorsman, I find his depiction of the wilderness contradictory at best, and unrealistic at worst. Apparently the author knows nothing of firearms, specifically military firearms. His description of the story's hero, Owen Gray, holding the WOODEN stock of a modern Marine Corps M40A1, is laughable, as all current USMC sniper rifles have composite stocks. Finally, none of the characters are believable or even sympathetic. This book was painful to read and hard to finish. Don't waste your time on this one. If you want to read an excellent fictional book about a former Marine sniper, check out Stephen Hunter's Point of Impact. If you want to read about the real thing, check out ""One Shot, One Kill"", which is about Gny, Sgt. Carlos Hathcock, an American hero from the Vietnam war, with 93 confirmed kills."
1,One badly written book,"Mr. Thayer did no real research into this book and it shows. From the police to the snipers, Thayer creates these characters to be no more than unrealistic, blathering idiots. Facts have no place in this book, just the fantasy renderings of a lawyer who has watched too much TV. This book may be for you if, you are a sixteen year-old video game junkie with delusions of sniping, but if want a story line with more realism than fantasy buy Stephen Hunter's Point of Impact. This book does nothing more than insult the character of Marines and police everywhere. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,tent,"I own a daycare and this tent gets alot of daily use, it is sturdy, large enough for 4 toddlers to sit in it comfortably with a large entrance and windows with ""curtains"" that can be tied back, its good because you can see inside easily, I strongly recommend this product."
5,rock roll benny,"very very heavy and darkly beautiful, great musicianship.great songs i think this band is the future of heavy metal,i highly reccomend this cd"
5,Quality and speed,this book was just as claimed. It arrived in a timely manner and I am enjoying reading it. Very well done! Thank you.
1,Not the book it's the MLM business model I do not vibrate to!!!,"I was involved with an MLM and it was recommended. However, I am not an MLM type person I realized that before I read this book. Since the MLM process went so low vibrating I did not read this book nor do I know what happened to it...Therefore I have no idea if it has value or not!"
3,"No real ideas, just encouragment.","I purchase this booking looking for ideas on how to run a successful party plan business but was disappointed.I gave this product three stars because it was good encouragement. It did have some great stories in it and a few good ideas, but for me... it just wasn't my cup of tea.Party On!-GameLady VerlinaSimplyFun Senior Consultant"
5,excellent condition,This book was used and came as if brand new...Thanks for a GREAT BOOK! Highly recommend!
2,Disappointed,"As a person new to network marketing, I am disappointed in this book. I expected to see many new techniques on finding new clients and recruits. They are the same methods the MLM companies have been telling you to do which do not work or make you any money. Like contacting friends, relatives, associates, neighbours. Nobody wants to be hounding the people closest to them for sales and recruits.There is no information on how to make the most of your business, shortcuts in the business, tips on how to get your business going, etc.It is a book based on the same methods and techniques that your MLM company might have told you to do. Who wants to approach their local cashier or someone you don't know at all for sales. That is intrusive. They don't talk about what a person can do if they don't have a lot of contacts or know a lot of people other than hitting up absolutely anybody off the street for sales.I do not recommend this book!"
4,Basic but essential ..,I'm a clinical psychologist. You need to have this book . You need to understand the psychopharmacology of your patients. Lots of interesting and important information regarding Dx and the effects of Rx. The only problem with this book is (as you know) things are changing so fast that we need a new edition.
4,Why the hype?,"I was left with the feeling from the other reviews that this book would be great for architects, which it is not. It is more for an art student. If you want a better book on architecture drawing get ""Color Drawing: Design Drawing Skills and Techniques for Architects, Landscape Architects, and Interior Designers, 2nd Edition"" by Michael E. Doyle"
4,Great Fun,"Overall, this was a great purchase. My 3 1/2 yr old little boy just loves driving these Monster Trucks, he keeps himself occupied for hours. The game is a lot of fun for Dad too-we love playing it together. It is great to see such prolonged concentration in a little boy. The graphics and sounds are fantastic. He especially enjoys designing and customizing his truck. One of the best features is that it works with Tonka's ""Digs and Rigs"" (also highly recommended) steering wheel controller that quickly mounts over your keyboard. Without this feature, I would not have purchased it for him. This is a game that is easy to get up and running properly within a few minutes of installing the software."
2,Nothing but trouble,"We have all the other Tonka titles and have loved them all. However, this game has been nothing but trouble for me. I installed it on Win 98 where it ran once, nicely, enough to get my boys excited. It never ran again. Countless uninstall/reinstalls have not fixed the problem. It's dead to Win 98. No problem, I'll install it on my Win2000 machine. Wrong! The warning says this game was not designed for 2000. I ran it anyway and it starts but is choppy and unplayable (1.5 GHz machine). I hope Tonka goes back to their original software developer."
3,More than a crash & burn,"If you run Windows XP, and really enjoy rebooting your computer, then I highly recommend this software package. We own the ""Dig & Rig"" play set and it works great, but this software is developed by a different company and they figured out how to make XP an unstable environment. The graphics and games are very well done, but I think the instability is too much for this adult let alone a child."
3,Good game for pre-school aged children,"My son plays this at his pre-school and he received it for Christmas. He is really having fun with it, it's easy to get around and the instructions from ""Tonka Joe"" are easy for him to follow. It has a lot of grahics and can be a little slow loading; it has also frozen up on us a few times and we had to restart the computer. Overall it has been a great game."
3,tonka monster trucks,"I liked the game and so does my son, but I was disappointed to find out that the dig and rigs playset does not work with the monster trucks."
2,problem with porcelain,I bought the Dutch oven for my grandmother she is 80 years old for her birthday. She loved it she made every thing in it. but after six months the porcelain on the bottom poped off in a chip when she was cooking something. She did every thing right with it. I am now looking for a new brand to try. the price on it is great so I wonder if it pays to spend the extra money.
1,No Customer Service,This is bottom of the line cast iron made in China. The guarantee is worthless as the Co. is out of business. Ultrex was one of the Innova brands tauted on HSN. After a major recall it seems they have evaporated. Want quality cast iron spend the bucks and go for LeCruset or Staub. You will have a quality product that will last a lifetime.
4,A solid book,"I would give the content of this book 3 stars, but since it's much better than Plaskett's effort on the same topic, I give it 4.Too much emphasis on variations and move orders (sometimes the author will have you flipping pages and you can get lost in the maze of transpositions).Also, I have the impression the book is written from white's point of view. This is especially visible in the short section on the Qd6 variation, where the author shows how black can quickly get into trouble without providing any improvements.Be aware also that the book is centered around the Qa5 and Nf6 main lines, with only a few pages devoted to Qd6. So if you only play the Qd6 line, there's very little here for you."
3,Superficial in Spots ...,"Every time I play the Scandinavian, I'm taken out of this book by 1.e4 d5 2.ed5 Qd5 3.Nc3 Qa5 4.d4 Nf6 5.Bd2 c6 6.Ne4 ... . The positions following this line aren't bad, but they're thematically much different than the main lines, and not as easy to play for black. White's game plays itself. In any case, more coverage of early deviations would have been nice."
3,A pleasant piece of work,"Voices--from Vangelis--was released in 1995. It consists of nine compositions. The album is almost 55 minutes. I like all of the pieces. Except for the gentle ""P.S."" and the serene, quiet ""Dream in an Open Place,"" the rest of the tracks include vocals. The album's sound quality is also nice. ""Echoes"" and ""Prelude"" are my favorite compositions. The laid-back ""Echoes"" exhibits an engaging melody with a pretty timbre, while ""Prelude"" is attractive and calm sounding. Examples of other pieces that I enjoy are ""Voices"" and ""Ask the Mountains."" Not only is ""Voices"" stately and spirited, but it is also lavish. The peaceful ""Ask the Mountains"" displays curious, nice female vocals. Actually, I rate this piece of work 3.5 stars. Voices is a recommendable piece of work."
3,My only Vangelis c.d.,"I listened to this c.d. in a music store some years ago and liked some of it enough to buy it. I am particular about ambient, contemplative music, and this c.d. just barely squeeked into that realm. Most of the c.d. is listenable, with a few tunes getting a foot into that space I consider nice (or close to it). Although it is the only Vangelis c.d. I currently own (with only one other they've put out that is sort of tempting me), it has won a small but permanent resting spot in a warm part of my heart. ""Losing Sleep"" (Still, My Heart) is by far my favorite tune. ""Come to me"" is also appealing, as is ""Echoes"", with its hypnotic , eight minute plus melody. All the other tunes are anywhere from listenable to kind of bland."
4,"A warmer, more ""human"" enterprise from a synthesizer wizard","My favorite on this album was ""Come to Me"". I taped it for a labor and birth cassette that I brought to the hospital with me. I included ""Come to Me"" several times on the tape--it seemed so perfect and was--especially when I started taking the pain drugs!! A striking contrast to Direct, which is one of my all time favorites as well as Heaven and Hell."
5,Vangelis' best work,"I have listened to many of Vangelis' albums, both new and old, and I believe that Voices stands out as his greatest work. The title track, Voices, is an instant New Age/Ambient classic. The whole album has an other worldly and almost eerie sound to it. You'll have to listen to the album from start to finish to truly appreciate it. Fans of Enya and Enigma may find something to appreciate here as well. If you like New Age music, don't pass up this sleeper hit."
5,Phenomenal,"The first several times listening to this CD may put you into a ""State of Shock"" because it is very Spectacular & Overpowering. It's like a musical miracle. I can relate to other reviewers comments about- Creation of the Universe and- floating in air, because this CD is very visually stimulating as well. Ask the mountains is very original. While listening to this I once visualized (while closing my eyes) seeing a female ghost like angel come down from the mountains speaking to me and fading in and out & moving around, appearing and disappearing strangly, ect... It's the same way with the other tracks-& all kinds of wonderful sound effects. Voices & Echoes are exceptional records that I have listened to countless times. Vangelis is the World's greatest living musician & composer. Consider this CD before you consider anything else."
3,Different...,"Although the opening title track is a bit derivative, Voices, as an album, tends to get somewhat deeper (and more interesting) the further in you go. The most provocative tracks include ""Come to Me,"" ""Ask the Mountains,"" and ""Losing Sleep (Still, My Heart),"" which feature guest vocals by the likes of Caroline Lavelle, Stina Nordenstam, and Paul Young, respectively.Overall, this is a somewhat unusual album, melodically, and though it's perhaps not as readily accessible as Direct nor as prolific as Mythodea, Voices has a voice of its own."
4,Heartbeat,"There is something compelling about this album. It's not the 'Voices' or 'Echoes' or even the captivating vocals on 'Come to me' and 'Ask the Mountain', it's what lies beneath. Vangelis is a musical magician and he draws us in with the clever vocal orchestration and arrangements on these tracks, but we are propelled along by something else. It's the beat. Listen to it, it's also your heartbeat. Like a march, it's rapid, strong and pumping at first in 'Voices', slowing to a walk in 'Echoes' and then you are barely aware of it by the time you reach the the appropriately titled 'Losing sleep (Still. My heart)'. The remaining tracks gently take us out of our reverie."
2,Pretty But Smaller Than Expected,"I saw this very pretty strapless bra and being a size 44D that is NOT easy to find!! This came close, but still not satisfied, this is why. I put it on for probably 15 minutes before I expected to leave the house. In that short timespan the top of the band had moved (slid) down squashing my boobs! Any female that has had a mamogram knows what I mean when I say they were squashed to look like pancakes. So you could easily see the top elastic line across my chest which was unsightly and looked (and felt) very uncomfortable. So size 44D is more like a size 38-40D and not comfortable in the least. I really wanted this to work out but so far I have not found a comfortable strapless bra for my size. This bra has now joined a stack of bras I call ""The Cruel Bras"". OUCH!"
1,Absolutely Useless!,"I purchased this to wear with summer cami tops under other tops based on other reviews that it had support. But there is no truth to that fact. I am a 44D if this bra offers support it should only be worn for sizes that have no bigger than an A-B Cup. I simply cannot imagine that it would work in any size other than that. Larger sizes should not even be offered, do not buy this if you have a cup size over a B."
1,Disappointing,"There is nothing ""adjustable"" about the cups. The points (dart seam in the cup) go wherever they want and can give a lopsided appearance. The cups are not ""molded."" The entire bra is made of thin, flimsy, cheap satin. To add insult to injury, breast support is minimal. Note: I am a 32/34 B."
1,Did not like bra,"This bra was horrible. This bra did not have any support,these side supports dug into my skin and the fabric was thin. I put this on and was ready to take this off at the end of the day hours. Not comfortabe at all."
1,not true size info,"The bra though fairly well made is at least one to two sizes smaller than specified. I know my size and this didn't fit. If you need one to fit, order one at least one or two sizes bigger than you usually get."
3,Pretty good; nothing to write home about...,"This bra works pretty well. Let's just say at the end of the day, I wasn't wearing it as a belt. It stayed where it was supposed to. I'm a full-figured gal and so it didn't have a ton of support but that's to be expected. I have really sensitive skin and the hook and clasp part of the bra itched my back so I sewed a little sleeve to slide over that section. Normal people probably wouldn't have a problem with it though. Overall, I'd recommend this bra if you are in a pinch and can't find something better in town. It's a good deal for the price."
1,Not for 38D's,"with back fat.The bra is pretty but it didn't work out for me at all! it dug into my skin, rolled up and rolled down... in short, it did everything but what it was supposed to do.I think this bra is made for women with smaller breast/back"
1,Pointless,"This ""bra"" is just a strip of fabric with a little shape. It does not support, conceal, or in any way act as a bra. Granted I'm a 42D, but I assumed this would do SOMETHING. It doesn't even prevent me showing nips in a sweater. Utterly pointless."
4,product as advertised,"The bras were as expected and I would readily recommend it to a friend, it is so comfortable. As a matter of fact, I have done so already."
5,Wonderful!,This was exaclty what I needed. I wanted a less cumbersome strapless bra that I could wear with a supportive gown and it was perfect!
3,"Size was too small, not what would have fit in other styles.","Size was too small, not what would have fit other styles. Had t send back and get larger size twice so that it would fit. Would suggest getting size larger than normally wear. Quality was very good."
2,not worth the price,This bra does not fit well and is uncomfortable. It does not provide any support. It does provide full coverage and could be worn under summer tops with no worry.
3,"Bra is comfortable, but....","I received this item with no problem from the vendor. Came as advertised and even fit nicely and was comfortable.However, you should note that if you're a woman of a ""certain age or size"" this bra affords zero support."
1,disappointed,I returned two items. One I wanted exchanged for another size. The other I wanted a refund.I never heard back from the company and this is over one month now.
2,No support,I needed enough support for a D cup in a strapless dress. This is not it. I do not like underwires but ended up in one because this one made the bodice fit horribly.
1,Waste of Money for larger chested woman,"Why even make the sizes that this bra comes in if there's absolutely no support? I can see there's no cups, but I thought there might be some boning on the sides of the bra. I put this thing on and it drooped right down. No support, too much cleavage, and uncomfortable too. What a waste of money, luckily it was cheap and the vendor shipped quickly."
2,yin but no yang,This ring is cool but after wear it a week one of the ball end came off. No problem I thought I can just use one my others. Then a ;littlt while after that the yin yang fell out. Nice so you see I am not wasring it any more...
5,The warmth of the cello in hands of one the best cellists of the world!,"This album is a true finding. Noras is a magnificent cellist, gifted of a powerful fingering and tonal personality, plus the presence of Bruno Rigutto at the piano make of this album a true collector item.The performance of Franck's arrangement of the Violin sonata is flawless. The second movement is amazing. And the lyrical noblesse of the last movement is carved in relief with sublime majestic.The formal austerity of Faure's cello sonata (1917) is underlined and played with imagination and éclat. It's another high point in this album.The only minor flaw I find is in the given approach respect Debussy' cello sonata. To my view, the performance lacks that sarcastic noblesse and lightness in the last movement. In this sense I have to recommend the version of Franz Helmerson during the Eighties.If you love the cello this album is for you!"
3,Easygoing mystery set in the world of county politics and scorching Texas heat,"Shortly after starting ""Red, White, and Blue Murder"", I saw the excellent crime film, ""No Country For Old Men"", starring Tommy Lee Jones as an aging Texas sheriff. Immediately thereafter, I started picturing the sheriff hero of this novel as the Tommy Lee Jones character of the film, which probably lent a little extra gravity and nuance to Dan Crider's novel that likely wasn't there originally. No matter, this is still a pretty good mystery novel even if you don't picture Tommy Lee Jones' sensitive performance or otherwise apply to the book the same ""weighty feel"" and generally thoughtful tone of the movie. Especially recommended for those who enjoy a laidback pace and generous amounts of cynical humor. The paperback edition of ""Red, White, and Blue Murder"" is only available new via a mail-order book club, but a previously-owned copy is easily obtainable through used-book venues, including those that link with Amazon."
2,For recent students of Physics,This book expects a lot of readers. I would not recommend it for those who have been away from Physics for a number of years and want to brush up on it. I haven't taken a Physics class for 10 years and find myself going back to my old textbook to get a better understanding of a concept that is being explained. The author assumes a fairly good understanding of the material and in many cases doesn't offer an explanation. You'd be better off just reviewing your old textbook unless you've taken College Physics in the last couple of years.
4,Art - A Crash Course,The size is terrific. Easy to slip into a purse or pocket and carry through the museum. Fine reference for art one does not know. Clear and concise and intelligently written. Nice heavy slick paper with lovely colored illustrations. I'm buying books for two of my art pals to carry (also) when we go to the museums together.
5,Whitework Quilting,"Karen is one of the best machine quilting teachers out there, and this book shows you why. Her directions are clear and concise, the photographs are stunning, and her comments are accurate as well as funny. Karen makes you feel like you, too, can do this! This is a beautiful coffee table book, and will be an asset to any quilter or non-quilter's library."
5,Beautiful beautiful Book,"This is the MOST beautiful book I own. I have completely fallen in love with the pictures of the completed works. It does have a few chapters on consturction and supplies, but it is not a machine quilting textbook. For that I would look to Harriet Hargraves Guide to Heirloom Machine quilting. However this book should be on every machine quilters book shelf. One note- Karen uses a long arm machine, but I use a regular sewing machine and find this book very valuable, as she nothing she talks about is exclusive to long arm machines"
3,Generally entertaining reading,"Main character, Heris Serrano, is a former military starship commander, who is forced out of the service by an evil Admiral. She carries this book pretty well with solid support from secondary character, Cecelia, who is a rich, aging former champion horsewoman, with a passion for fox hunting. The riding and hunting scenes are very well done, and it appears that Moon must herself have a passion for these things. The book loses its direction in the middle when Cecelia's spoiled nephew and his foolish cronies sneak off for a picnic and find themselves in the middle of a hunt where men are the prey. The book eventually regains its footing and the ending is fairly strong, promising an interesting sequel (which I will certainly read). All in all, a pretty good book."
4,"Foxhunting can be ""the most dangerous game""","The first book in Elizabeth Moon's ""Familias Regnant"" series (and easily the best of the first three), this novel combines two of the author's interests--horsemanship and navy life--that would at first glance seem incongruous, and sprinkles liberally with Machiavellian House politics. If a would-be reader enjoyed ""Sassinak"" and ""Generation Warriors,"" this is a good book to try next.Though it may seem to some that Moon spends too much time focusing on characters who hold little interest compared to Heris, this is not merely Heris's story (as readers will find later in the series). Though it may not be evident at first, this book sets up for important events that will take place later on."
2,Too much emphasis on setting,"I've waded through to page 150, but it's been a struggle, and I'm absolutely bored. The most interesting things that have happened so far are that smuggled goods (never identified) have been found aboard, and the yacht owner's spoiled brat of a nephew has jeopardized everyone with a stupid prank. Much of the book to this point has been setting -- the yacht's decor, the environmental features, the characters' clothes, the cuisine, even the yacht owner's exercise equipment. I've got 200+ pages to go, and they promise to be much the same.So I set this book aside for MAROONED, a Star Trek Voyager book that also deals with space pirates. Within 30 pages, I'm hooked -- and I've never really been a Star Trek fan. Seeing the contrast between it and Moon's book I decide I've had enough of HUNTING PARTY, which goes into my box of charity give-aways.Too bad -- it could have been a good story if there hadn't been so much fat."
1,Science Friction,"There is nothing like a good science fiction story... And this IS nothing like a good science fiction story. This tale has been told in many, many different books and films and every single one of them was better than this poor excuse for a novel. The characters lacked depth, the premise lacked credibility and the plot had more holes in it than a factory full of of polo mints. Instead of being an integral part of the story the science fiction element (basically a disgraced starship captain and a few wretched attempts at some futuristic style technology) was totally incidental and the story could easily be cloned to take place in any country, in any social setting and in any period in time. This was the first Elizabeth Moon I had ever read... and the last."
3,Not Moon's best work.,"This isn't Elizabeth Moon's best work. A good portion of the book takes us away from the excellent main character she developed, to follow the tribulations of some rather unlikeable characters that we're now supposed to root for. That portion drags."
2,"Skip Book One, The Idle Rich of the Future Are Boring!","This is a book about horse back riding (and racing), fox hunting, and managing a space yacht. It involves the adventures of spoiled rich children, and their eccentric aunt, who doesn't even like them much. We get introduced to Herris Serrano, an ex-captain of the Fleet, starring in the role of nursemaid to her idle rich employers. She also gets enmeshed with the police as an investigator, which doesn't make sense as Fleet officers are not trained detectives.The first half of the book is soul-crushingly boring, and I would have dropped it already if I hadn't gotten the trilogy as one item. The second half follows odious characters too closely, over-emphasizes the setting of 'rich hunting world', and barely scrapes up an ending. I had a hard time relating to the characters, and while later books in the series are better, I'd simply skip book one. Overall, not enough worthwhile to make the time reading pay off."
2,Sorry Survivor Fan,"I am disappointed. Infogames or whatever they call themselves blew this one. They had a chance to turn the hit show into a hit game. Ugh. This game is a hit in the recycling bin.OK, so maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe I'm just a little annoyed that being a die-hard fan, I wanted a great game. I asked for too much. Here's the good:1) Fun to vote. That's about it.The bad:1) Computer is stupid. Here's an example of a conversation I had with a contestant:Who do you think is going to be voted off at Tribal Council?Computer: Time is running out...for Rodger.What have you heard?Computer: Amber is on edge.Should we get rid of Rodger?Computer: You're crazy!You've seen enough. 2)The reward/immunity challenges are exactly the same: either shooting at targets, doing a race carrying something, or flinging rocks.3) The graphics are a bit subpar.4) The voting doesn't always make any sort of sense.That about does it. Don't buy it."
1,ITS AN OUTRAGE,"DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SAVE YOUR CASH...BEING A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER BY DAY, AND SURVIVOR FAN BY NIGHT, I CAN ONLY SAY THAT THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE, AND HAS ONLY SOLD COPIES BY LEACHING OFF THE PHENOMENA THAT HAS BECOME SURVIVOR. SPEND YOUR MONEY ON A NICE DINNER OUT, YOU WILL ENJOY THE MEAL A LOT LONGER THAN YOU WILL ENJOY THIS GAME."
1,Beware,"I am utterly disgusted that this game was even put on the market. I have computer that was leased brand new in August and the game will absolutely not work. They have put out a patch that didn't fix the problem will ""possibly"" be out in the next week. I wouldn't even suggest buying it if and when a patch is completed. From what I have actually seen of the game it is absolutely boring and the challenges are way too easy."
1,This game is bogus,"I couldn't get it loaded on my old machine as it wasn't fast enough. My new machine is certainly fast enough, has more than enough RAM, exceeds all requirements, but this game won't load if you run Windows xp. I had tried it a few times on my husband's computer before he upgraded to xp, and it was hard to understand how to use the characters. I have watched every episode of ""Survivor"" ever televised, I bought this game after Australian Outback, and there were supposed to be upgrades that don't exist - the website referred to doesn't exist."
1,"If you bought this game, demand your money back","This game is extremely terrible. First, installing the game is more work than it is worth. Second, horrible graphics. Third, horrible game play. Fourth, meaningless conversation and bad music. Missions are terrible, no collision detection, etc. Need I say more? This game is a total disaster, and is a down right let down to any survivor fan out there. It is a complete disgrace.It is not worth the money to buy. ... Save it for something practical, or something that is fun and works."
1,Avoid at all costs!,"I am not an incompetent...I can do this....I can always make things work on the computer, I said to myself as I spent most of the day trying to install and play survivor. The trick seems to be that your computer will crash at some point. The furthest I got was to the end of one reward challenge, whereupon my computer crashed before I got to find out the reward....I suggest that you wait until the makers of the game tweak all of the programming errors before you invest time and money in this. I was enthusiastic...yes I was. But rebooting a crashed computer several times a day is not my idea of holiday fun.Trust me--it's the game, not me. Thumbs irrevocably down."
1,These programmers should be ashamed,"After playing a once, I almost threw it out.After playing it again, I did throw it out.This is one of the worst games if not THE worst game I have ever played. Shame on the developers for fooling us into buying this tragedy by capitalizing on the Survivor name.This must have taken 2 hours to program. TERRIBLE."
2,HAHAHAHA,"... You can't start alliances they never listen! They just randomly vote and say stuff!!!!The graphics are sooooooooooo poor! It's laughable! Oh, and if you get voted off after the merge you don't get to be in the jury! You even play the same challenge VER and OVER again!Youe ven don't build shelter!!!! Here's what you do Walk around and talk to people who randomly say stuff next reward challenge that doesn't matter then immunity then tribal council. In tribal council you just vote. They don't dramatize it, Jeff doesn't ask you anything the CPU randomly vote!I gave it a 2 because it's so pathetic it's funny!I would reccomend this to canibalistic clouns, Party going monkeys and fools."
1,I wish I could return it to the store...,"I should have read these reviews before buying it myself. Coulda saved myself 20 bucks. I totally agree with what the other reviewers have to say. It's tedious, the AI is repetitive and does not seem to have any effect on the voting, gameplay is horrible and with the exception of the trivia, the challenges were long and boring. You can tell this game was rushed out to capitalize on the remaining popularity of the show. Buy at your own risk....you've been warned, I tells ya!"
2,NOT FOR ME!,"When I orignally wanted to get the game I was so excited.....not anymore...they repeat everything, u always win, chaleenges same, graphic worse out of anywhere.... I suggest you dont waste your time and money on this game."
1,Doesn't work,"The game doesn't work for most people! There is a bulletin board with numerous adverse comments. There are already many patches for errors, etc."
1,I could have enjoyed it more.,"I think that after they get the bugs fixed with this game, it could be more fun. I had no trouble installing it, but when I tried to play, I ran into problems. Either my person would freeze up until the other team won, or on the slingshot challenges (either for the team before the merge or individual in the shorter game)my character would go off the course and end up in a black screen. From there I could exit fine, but I really wanted to play the rest of the game.Even once all the bugs are fixed, I think only the die hard Survivor fans will really enjoy it."
2,Absolutely the worst game I have ever lost sleep playing!,"Huge Survivor fan here, just happened to see the game on the shelf and picked it up. Don't get me wrong, this would have been an awesome game if it had come out about 8 years ago. It has more bugs than a Dairy Queen bathroom, and the graphics are about as clean as Richard's taint after 33 days on the Island. All that said, I did play it for 5 hours or so (unfortunately this was due to the fact that a few of the challenges took 30 or so minutes to complete). If they come out with a MASSIVE patch for this thing, it would be worthwhile to pick up (considering the low low price). However, the only way its worth ($...) now is if they start taping twenty dollar bills inside the boxes."
2,Bugs,"This game has so many bugs its annoying. It either freezes, the screen goes black, or you just sit their waiting for a popup when it never comes. I was looking foward to the game but know that I paid my 15 I regret that I did. It has so many bugs. Its annoying."
2,Coul;d have been better,"This game is a classic underachiever! While some aspects are interesting, it quickly becomes tedious. Clearly this format is difficult to transpose to gaming, but only the most ardent Survivor fans should purchase this game. Not much entertainment value here unfortunately."
3,Wow I got voted out...,"This has to be the most annoying game ever. I played 3different games and each time I got voted out 8th. Thedialog is just awful and doesn't mean anything. If youform an alliance with someone, they will still probabally vote for you. At the beginning you get to choose a different job to do each day and the computer does the job for you. What is the survival time for anyway? save your 20 bucks. Oh yeah and at least7 of the challenges are almost the same, in one you push a boulder in another you push a log. Who cares?"
2,it's fun but um.....,"you can't do ANYTHING!!!i tried to make my team do a contest where you push logs toa finish line and guess what? they acted like a bunch of idiots!!! you just sat there doing nothing!! it's fun to talk to people but be prepared to do stuff yourself but at my camp my people walked around,picked up water and fished!! but that was itthey even refused to help me when i needed a question answered they just would tell me to find the answer to something myself!!!"
1,This is horrid!!!,"I bought this game about a month ago and, several video cards later, I still can't get this game to work. No wonder it only cost [price]. I love ""Survivor"", the TV show, but this game is useless. Most people can't get it to run; and those that do find it locking up all the time. And by the sounds of things, even when it runs the game is stupid, repetitive, and the AI is a joke. Worst game ever....and that's me being polite."
1,don't do it....,DON'T GET IT!!! This is not a cool game. I bought it for 30 bucks and was really disapointed. It is slow moving and boring. Talking with the other people is so lame- you have to pick from a list of choices and you don't ge to say what you want to. Why don't you get Tony Hawk- that game rocks and is so much better.
1,Worst Game Ever,"This game is the worst. The only thing that is remotely fun about this game is some of the challenges. Other than that, I don't believe that interacting with computer characters using fabricated conversations was any fun. =("
3,Patience required,"Being a major Survivor fan, i was a bit disappointed. But since I am a major Survivor fan, I was able to cope with the slowness of the game. Patience is not included in the game - you need to supply the patience. The transitions between games are very slow and some challenges take almost an hour. Still, you get the feel of the TV show vaguely and it still deserves 3 stars."
2,Sorry Survivor Fan,"Let me say I LOVE the Survivor TV show. So Infogrames or whatever the heck they call themselves released this game, I eagerly bought it. Too bad I didn't realize the game was fun for about five minutes. The computer is inconsistent, pathetic, dumb, and downright boring to talk to. The ""challenges"" are easy, boring, and quite bland. Even the screenshots are misleading. You see a screen with everyone sitting around the campfire. I never ONCE saw that in the game, and I got to after the merge. What B.S! The advertisements are misleading- STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME! Sorry Infogrames, you blew it."
2,Oh LOOK it's the SIMS on an island!!!,"Just when you thought they couldn't milk the Survivor thing here comes this.Don't get me wrong I love the original Survivor ... it was different. Survivor Outback had it's attractive qualities too. And I'm sure that Survivor III will be popular too, just look at Survivor's predecesor ... The Real World ... they're up to what now? Real World 25?I can not see how this game will be interesting for more than one day. The one thing that could've made this game interesting would be the graphics, but they're just average. Bad graphics of a tropical paradise or the Outback will just [tick] me off.Now I'll tell ya this ... I would be fired up about this game and send in my preorder if they at least let us kill the characters in a first-person perspective shoot-em up ... now that's my kinda SURVIVOR!"
1,Just a heads up for anyone looking at this game..,"It never worked for me on the 4 computers I tried it on. (Windows 98, ME, XP, and XP) even when my computer lived up to all the specs on the box. A definite do not buy!"
1,Will you survive the operation of Survivor,"This is the buggiest computer game I have ever used: nothing works. I loaded this program and have never been able to get it to work properly. It locks-up my computer everytime the game is played. I have had to download several other programs in an attempt to get Survivor working and to date nothing has done the trick. Approximately 8 hours of my time has been spent trying to get this program working for my nine year old son and it has been a miserable experience. In fact, writing this review to warn others of the pitfalls of this program has been my only satisfaction to date. I would not recommend this program to anyone. Don't buy it. I would have rated it with zero stars, but the star scale doesn't go that low."
1,Horrible Game,"My friend invited me over to play this game with him on his PC, the game is boring and the graphics are poor quality. Don't waste your money on this item."
3,It's okay,"My sister had this when I was like 3 and though I had no idea what I was doing, I loved it. When I was 10 I decided to buy it again (hers broke) and I was so excited. I loved it so much! I think it was kinda funny how the screenshots were all fake. The one where they're sitting near the fire, that never happens. And the one where they show the challenge with the plastic cup with water in it never happened, thats not a challenge. I think it is a little to easy though. But, when you talk to people during tribal period, say I was talking to Stacy, she'd say, ""I'm gonna vote for Maralyn"". So at tribal I vote say I vote for Keith, there will be no votes for Maralyn and 60% of the time whoever you'd vote for gets out even if his/her name never turned up. But I think its pretty good but I'd get the newest one it's a lot better."
1,YUCK!,"To put it simply this game sucks! If you don't like someone, give them this as a christmas present. The original Atari games were more challenging and entertaning than this(...). Wizard Works should have WORKED on this game before they released it. I don't watch the show but, you shouldn't have to, to ""get"" playing the game."
3,Archetypal Road Novel,"Follows the archetypal road novel trajectory; the tall-tale yarning protagonist eventually picks up various hitchhikers and travelers with their own tales to tell, each with a philosophical bent, on his journey through the late fifties and sixties to reach the grave of the Big Bopper."
2,A Disappointing Follow-up to Fup,"I loved Fup... everyone I know loves Fup. Fup convinced me that Jim Dodge is a genius. Not Fade Away, while showing flashes of that brilliance, is also many things that Fup is not: contrived, overlong and redundant, and ultimately anticlimatic. Somehow Dodge lost the storytellers knack for the concise and telling detail on this one."
5,This is a great book for all ages! -Write me!,"When a young, divorced, mother is falsly accused of beating her young daughter. She tries everything withen her power to fight this accusation.

Will she ever live a normal life with her precious daughter?What will happen to the love that is springing up in their harts? Find out in Anonymous Tip"
3,"Not the best book ever written, not the worst","I'll attempt to keep my thoughts simple...this book was just ok...It's too far fetched (who really sues CPS & goes the whole way to the Supreme Court)and I didn't agree with how it was suddenly ok for Peter & Gwen to marry as soon as Gordon kicked the bucket, but it did make for an easy read."
5,Outstanding Book with a Terrible Title!,Almost didn't read this book because of the title -- but glad that I did. Farris provides a thought provoking account of today's court system using a storyline that was realistic -- and his research compelled me look for other books by him.
1,A joke,"This book denigrates the many hard working people out there trying to stop child abuse. It paints the mother as good and virtuous, and the child care people as a bunch of boozy floozies with no morals. This is ridiculous. No child care worker ever took a child away because of spanking, that's just pure hysteria. But hitting children is wrong and speaking out against it, whether by child care workers or neighbors or anyone else, is the brave, noble and yes moral thing to do."
1,Waste of paper,"I've read some really great books in my life and some not so great and rarely do I come across a book that provokes such emotion that I feel compelled to write a review. However, I can't exactly say I read this book because, for the sake of my sanity, I never finished it. Not only was the storyline development exaggerated and biased, but the writing was immature and insubstantial. Of course there are things that can go wrong within the CPS system, but to publish a story that is so grossly exaggerated and inaccurate is actually an enormous disservice to everyone. Just like there is free speech for an author to write a book like this, there is also power of choice. And although I wasted my money, I'm not going to waste my time finishing this book."
1,"While Opinionated is Fine, this is Ridiculous...","Yep, people go into Child Protective Services careers -- which pays badly and gives you too much responsibility and not enough power -- for the power trip. CPS is really out to get the poor god-fearing parents, by stealing away their children. Apparently, Micheal Farris, an advocate of home schooling, really believes that everyone is out there to get him.This book is trash, and not particularly well written trash. If you want to hear about the evil government, and the good citizens whose prayers are answered, you might enjoy this book. If you want good writing, a believable story, or characters who don't pray but are still nice people, avoid this book at all costs."
5,What a great author!,"You can't get enough of Mary Robert's Rinehart! She may be an author that is nearly 100 years ago but her writing is witty, engaging, surprising and can't-put-down quality!"
4,enjoyable,even after one hundred years this story still delivers . very easy to finish. kept my interest all the way thru.
5,Great read!,I truly enjoyed this book and introduction to this author. I am looking forward to reading her other works because I so enjoyed this book. I took a chance and was so very surprised by the story and how it kept my attention to the very end.
1,A very poor attempt at a comeback...,"Bonnie, who produced some memorable tunes in the 80's, attempts to capitalize on Nicki French's hit remake of ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"" by remaking Meatloaf's ""Two Out of Three Ain't Bad"" in the same vein. The songs here are extremely weak and the entire project sounds uninspired. Sometimes it's best to rest on past glories."
2,Time for a new direction?,"You know, I think it's time for Ms. Tyler to realize that she is not a biker chick anymore (was she ever?) and face the fact that it's time to grow up. Even with the raspy, damaged sound of her voice, her vocals can be extraordinary, but here, she sounds merely tired and used. Songs like ""Sexual Device"" wouldn't even cut it on an 18 year old's disc let alone the middle aged Ms. Tyler's. It's time for some new, more sophisticated song writers and producers to get this recording artist's career back into gear and let us hear what she's truly capable of. For shame."
4,"Pretty Good album,but contains to much filler","This is a pretty good disc,but does contain to much filler.The only track that really stands out as a classic is her remake of ""Making Love"".This was a missed chance at a hit.Poor promotion from East West didnt help."
4,Best work of the 90s for Bonnie!,"This is a pretty good album, even though it lacks the sound that really launched her career in the 80s. I think it should have more piano sounds than synthesizers. I must say however that (making love) Out of Nothing at All is a great song by Air Supply, but Bonnie's voice is far more powerful in my opinion. It is the extended version and boy is it ever worth it. Her take on ""2 out of 3 ain't bad"" sends her in a new direction. I found that meat Loaf's version was great, but this upbeat one is just as good. It gives it a new life. In my opinion, a great album for the 90s. Her best 90s album!"
4,raspy vocal,"I really enjoy two cover versions on this album. ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" is emotional but not over wrought. ""Making Love Out Of Nothing At All"" is just as or even more powerful than Air Supply's version."
5,Bonnie Tyler Still Has It!!!!,"The loyal fans of Bonnie Tyler will love this comback album. It is either loved or hated, I am one who felt this album is grest to add to your collection. She returned to her old form and NOT the one hit wonder with ""Total Eclipse Of The Heart"" that she had been labled by her rivals."
3,I enjoyed it..,"Bonnie Tyler has an extraordinary voice. This album is not for everyone, in this album she experiments by showcasing her vocal talents in various ways. I think you'd have to be a true fan in order to appreciate it."
4,If u're into Ween...,"Fans of Ween, I can say fairly confidently that if you do like Ween you will like this one too. There are several trippy songs on here and I have to say I liked it from first listen and it grew from there. I have been listening to Ween since The Pod and Pure Guava days so I know a thing or two about the band, alright? Don't doubt the Boognish..."
2,condition of packaging,the package for this product was worn from apparently being stocked in store previous to being sent to me. i store price take was still on outer packaging too.
1,Returning,"These clippers do not hold a charge for more than ten minutes, are heavy, and get very hot in five minutes. I am Disapointed with these especially since Whal is supposedly the number one brand of clippers ."
4,Very Sweet...But sensitive?,"It never fails- guys are clueless. This manga is about a high school girl (don't ask me to spell her name, or any name, it's just beyond me) who has grown up in a household of spoiled brothers. In high school, her best friend is one of those beautiful-yet-boy-struck girls who may or may not have a scheme or two cooking when an old flame shows up. Problem is, our heroine not only never told crush boy her feelings but also manages to offend andthen emotionally ensnare his best friend! All within a week of starting freshmen year. This girl has got her hands full between a beaudecious best friend, aloof crush, hot tempered and beautiful eyed kumdo members, and three bothersome bros."
2,Needs work,"First off i'm from the same place as him and have heard him kill tracks. For a debut this was just lazy and stail. I know he's been doing his thing here and there but don't play like it's your second or third CD. He did rock tracks where he wasn't overcome by the beat and was clearly heard. As for tracks where the hooks were not need and just trash? XXL needed focus. I mean he's an ENGLISH teacher. And Bad Newz MCs don't do the whole down south thing. Keep it real, take it back to the 8ball days."
4,Rush on Steroids!,"Alex Lifeson takes no prisoners on his first (and only) solo effort. If you love Rush, you'll love Victor. My advice, though, is to start with track 2. Track one is dark and disturbing and really doesn't fit with the rest of the record. But the rest of Victor is incredible - play loud!"
2,Alex Experiments,"This album, by Alex's own admission, was an experimental exercise...and it shows. The songs are definitely not Rush-esque by any stretch of the imagination. Alex's tastes in more straight-forward hard rock are in full effect. It is quite a surprise to read the lyrics to the first song, which is quite crude and pornographic. I wonder if Alex purposely led the album off with this as a statement to say, ""No. These are not Neil's lyrics!"" The album could be lumped in with many no-name hard rock bands of the early 90's. There is no noticeable style or discernable direction that makes it stand out.It's not that the songs are bad, they just aren't good either. It's not an album that I listen to regularly. The one highlight that I enjoy is ""Shut Up Shuttin' Up!"" where Alex's wife and his friend's wife bicker about their husbands while they boys play a pretty good instrumental piece. It is both an enjoyable listen and hilarious at the same time."
3,Alex on his own,"I like most of the songs and sounds on the CD. I think some are a bit a turn back to his early years as seen on the video ""beyond the lighted stage""."
2,Regressive Rock,"I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed with this album. It sounds like what it is: Rush without the insightful lyrics of Neil Peart or the vocals/bass of Geddy Lee (actually, the singer does sound like Geddy in his earlier days). I won't say that it's a bad album, but to be honest, I haven't been inspired to listen to it much since I bought it. The band, Rush, has grown and evolved so much over the years; this is a step backward."
1,Rubbish,"While Alex Lifeson is considered a master guitarist, he's clearly not the driving creative force behind Rush these days, as evidenced by this steaming pile of musical dung.This album -- lyrically, musically and conceptually -- is excrement, with Lifeson demonstrating none of the qualities that make Rush's music compelling. From a guitar perspective, it's an aimless, disjointed soup of half-realized riffs. Lyrically, it's simply offensive when it isn't completely risible.It's a mess, and recommended only for no one."
2,I expected a LOT BETTER from Alex Lifeson,"I've been a Rush fan and guitar player for 24 years and consider all of Rush's albums to be good releases. And Alex Lifeson is THE reason I learned to play guitar in the first place.However, it pains me to say that Victor is a big disappointment. It is a disturbing album about the ""dark side of love""... Hardly something you would expect (or want) from a member of Rush.It does have a few good songs, like ""Promise,"" ""Start Today"" and ""Strip and Go Naked."" Also, there is, not suprisingly, some interesting guitar work.Unfortunately, other than these few strong points, most of the material is unlistenable and forgettable.Not recommended."
1,Most disappointing Toy,"My three year old daughter loves dogs and of all the toys she asked Santa for, I thought she would enjoy this the most. Unfortunately, the first dog we received did not do any of the things advertised and neither did the replacement dog we ordered. Neither dog answers to claps or calls or returns to its dog house, but the dogs utter in a very weird voice, ""Come on doggie."" It is very strange. As the other reviews mention, the ramp also falls off the dog house-a house my daughter doesn't even use for the dog it came with; instead she uses it for her other dogs which she plays with and were $25 cheaper. This toy was very disappointing."
1,Disappointing Doggy,"We ordered this for Christmas for our daughter. Unfortunately the on/off switch does not work, so the dog would not stop unless we dismantled it and removed the batteries. Then the dog kept getting stuck and would not get in its house by itself. This is a very poorly made toy and was a waste of money along with a major Christmas dissapointment."
2,Disappointing,"I was excited to give this to my daughter for her 3rd birthday. It's about a month later and she likes her stuffed animals better. It's got a flat plastic bottom and wheels -- nothing fun to hug or hold at all. it rarely makes it back to the house on it's own. Despite the cool commericals, all it really does is bark and roll."
1,HELLO PARENTS! LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW,"I don't have this, and let me tell you I never want it. All the reviews say it's junk. So listen. Don't cave, get them something else. They don't show the commerciel any more, so but another dog to get them to forget about it. Animal Alley sells cute dogs fo onley $5.00. Buy them. Please, unless you wan't to waste your money, don't buy this. It's a peice of junk. Onley pay $35.00 if you want your child to cry. I would of given it a - 10,987,654.321 rating if I could. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PEICE OF WORTTHLESS JUNK! PLEASE!"
3,Spotty,"The good news is that ""Souvenier From A Dream"" is musical perfection. Must be heard. ""Grip Of Love"" is very strong also. ""Red Leaves"" is okay.The bad news is all the rest of this. ""Breakin' In My Heart"" is all foreplay with no follow-up; I'll bet it would have sounded better if played by Television. Verlaine really hit his limitations on this record if you ask me."
4,I don't get it,"I loved ""Tidewater Tales"" and was enormously impressed so went looking for other John Barth books and found ""Sabbitical"". The names are different but the story (or one of the stories) and I still enjoyed it. However I was hoping to find something from the author explaining why write ""Sabbitical"" first and then retell the tale as part of ""Tidewater Tales"", although I now know why the Talbots boat is called ""Reprise"""
3,Has some good moments.,"Dead Winter Dead is quite ambitious and energetic. I find this to be a little better than Handful of Rain; mainly because it's more experimental and the songwriting and musicianship seems better. ""Overture"" reminds me of King Diamond (it's quite dramatic). It's also great to hear Jon Oliva sing on a couple of tracks (no one does it better than he does). The ones that he sings on are ""I Am"" and ""Doesn't Matter Anyway."" The keyboard playing throughout the album is also good. Dead Winter Dead does deserve some credit. I do admit that I don't listen to it often and don't consider it to be a personal favorite--it's never grabbed me like previous efforts. They've released much better material. Worth a listen."
2,The Worst Savatage for the Metal Music Lover,"If you like metal (which is what Savatage used to be all about), this is the cd to avoid. There are only 3 good songs on this cd.If you like operatic, symphonic music, you may find something good about this cd."
2,"Far below Hall Mtn King, Edge of Thorn and Gutter Ballet","I have listened to this cd at least 9 times and it still does not get any better.It is boring, nothing special.Personally, I believe Savatage died with Chris Oliva (RIP)"
5,Awsome!,"If you like Trans-Siberian Orchestra, you'll probably love this! It's kind of a rock opera that I'm really fond of. Hey, tell me a story with music, and I'm happy."
5,The Gargoyle,"A brilliant rock opera- Concept album about three lost souls in the Bosnian wars. The music is loud and powerful. Combines classical within the rock format. Mozart and Beethoven both have their music incorporated within it are content. Read the booklet in order to understand the story line and the poetry helps also. Zak's vocals have never sound better, and the two songs Jon sings are perfect for his voice. The album will make you question all you really hold dear and feel when the only one left who morn's is the gargoyle. This could be performed on stage and would blow Tommy out of the water. This album is poetry put to music buy at once!"
4,Another superb rock opera from the masters of the form,"Savatage have once again created an excellent rock opera with ""Dead Winter Dead"". While not quite as good as ""Wake of the Magellan"" musically, the story line and characters in this opera are the most meaningful and relivant they have created since ""Streets"". ""Christmas Eve (12/24)"" foreshadows much of the Trans-Syberian Orchestra work."
1,Do not buy,I ordered this but received a Phonex device used for collection issues. Since I don't have collection issues I returned it. I feel very misled and I had to foot the bill for shipping! Do not order if you really want the Zenith ZEP100 EZ Hang-up because you will not get it.
2,Notifies unwanted callers to stop calling,All this little thing does is send a spoken message in the proper form to notify a telemarketer to take you off their list.Unfortunately not all such telemarketers heed the request!
2,"no memory, totally manual",This device only gives the outgoing message if you press the button. It has no memory and so if they call again you have to press the button again. Dishonest and criminal callers will not be put off by this. They will continue calling. One called five times a day for many days.
2,"Worked, but...","The good news is that this device worked as advertised. It does play a nice ""go away"" message to people on the other end of the telephone. The issue (at least for me) was that it didn't stop the telemarketers one bit. I ended up just putting my phone on 5 rings before answering machine starts to answer, and only answered phone calls from my family, and that worked a *lot* better."
4,blusher is a good thing,I really like this product. Both the transluscent and the colored side. I am no at all impressed with the brush....it is hard to use but otherwise good product
2,Was disappointed.,"I gave this to my daughter, she got rid of her other knives only to find out that these were not sharp. She rarely uses them. She can't even peel potatoes with them. They are all serated which we did not know. No I would not recommend them to anyone else. Sorry."
1,My biggest disappointment from Amazon,In three months these knives have dented and rusted. I hope it's not too late to return to the manufacturer. I wouldn't consider buying this brand again!
2,Didn't ship one of the knives!,Knives were fine except they didn't ship the pearing knife. And I tried to dispute it but it wouldn't let me unless I returned the whole thing. Ridiculous.
5,It feels like home!,"If you have never used this knife before you will be amazed!I owned on prior but during a divorce my ex hid the knifes the day I moved out, knowing they were my favored item in the kitchen. These knifes are now replaced. they are perfect and once you get a handle on the capabilities of this knife the possibilities are endless! For me it makes my kitchen feel more like home.They are not weird to hold, they are extremly sharp and they have a fliud shape to them this is a way awesome product! They are very comparable to the Cutco brand!"
5,Ginsu knives,"I love these knives, they work so well.Very durable. They are extremely sharp,I love the design of the knives andthe block. They would look great inany kitchen."
3,Japanese label on product made in China,"First the item was delivered without ordering issues. However, the package clearly states it is a Ginsu knife set with a Japanese stainless steel label; however, all knives are made in China. Are these the same quality? Will they stay sharp and last as long?"
1,Perfect library book to be read for free...,"I was interested in learning about the history of hospital care in NYC and I thought the parallel comparison between Bellevue and New York Hospital had potential. While there is some information from the historical record to be found, the author makes the reader waste too much time slogging through her personal bias to get to the historical fact. Following the author's premise that health care is a right and should, therefore, be free, I trust she also supports google copying books for free placement on the internet. Knowledge and information are also rights and should be free...therefore, this is a library book only...most definitely not worth the $60 price but purchased only one time and then loaned over and over again, never to result in royalty payments."
2,Disappointing,"This video was very limited in application to dogs. The subject being groomed was a show dog whose hair was in excellent condition, no mats, already expertly cut. Dog was also perfectly cooperative and passive. There were no tips about cleaning or grooming specific areas, such as ears, paws, or bottom. If you want to know how to do a top knot, then this video is for you."
2,Disappointing,"I found ""Show Off Your Dog GROOMING BASICS"" to be extremely limited. It does give a good illustration of bathing, combing, and how to do a top knot, but too much time is spent on each task. There is very little instruction on how to position your dog for clipping, and ""no"" instruction on how to get your dog to cooperate. If you want to learn how to use clippers on your dog, this is not the video for you. Overall, it's a disappointment."
2,Show Dogs Only!,"This video was VERY disappointing! It relates only to Shih Tzu owners who plan on showing their dog. The tips were from a ""professional"" that handles a very docile, already well-groomed dog. There are no basic tips for the typical dog owner--just fancy topknot and show grooming. Who keeps a dog oiled? Definitely not for your average dog owner. I suggest you save your money for a good groomer!"
5,A West Coast Classic,If you like west coast rap this is a must have for you collection. The whole cd is the bomb.
5,A brilliant science fiction mystery novel!,"Architects of Hyperspace is a well-written, engrossing story about a group of space travelers who come across an abandoned planet made up of concentric rings. Dr. McDonough's humor and knowledge of space (he's spokesman for SETI and The Planetary Society) combine to make this an exciting and enjoyable adventure."
3,ok,"i have every backyard sport game on pc every made.there all the same.there to easy.in football i have scored over 100 points in 1 game.they getold to.only pros are a linebacker a defesive linemen a qb or a running back no wide resivers or cornerbacks,olny 5 people on field for one team,you have to have more.i think the people who made it should make it more real.it has wierd names for made up teams.the pigskins!?orcras!?i whish they would make it more hard,and i think they should have more things to do.like madden 2003,thats the best game i've ever played.it has lots of things do do..."
3,Easy for Kids,"My 6 year old son enjoys the game. What he enjoys may not be what you expect. The game allows kids to choose pro teams and pro football players (as kids.) My son enjoys picking the teams as much as he enjoys playing the game. A neat feature is an ability to mold a player, picking build, sex, hair style/color and playing ability. This is especially fun for kids. Playing the game is rather cumbersome, however. The computer does a lot of the work. You really only play one player. Plays are available but do not make much sense to a young kid. A good game. We've tried some of the others, backyard baseball and soccer (not basketball yet.) Baseball seems to require the most input but it is slow. My son likes soccer the best. Have fun."
4,Backyard Sports does it agian,"Humongous Sports has just launched another great sports game with this title. If you have ever played the original Backyard Football,your in for just as much and maybe even more fun. Added features include more fields,added pro players,more power ups, a full draft mode were other teams select players,and speedier game play. The only down part is that kicking is incredibly tough and The pass routes can get a little confusing. But all in all this is a wonderful game. If your a fan of the backyard series this is an absloute must have."
5,Great game!,I bought this game with christmas money in late December of 2001 and I played it and found that it was one of the best Backyard Sports games ever! The gameplay is fun and easy to learn.I highly recommend this to fans of the Backyard Sports games and fans of football.
4,Football at its Best,"I have not bought this game yet but I have played it at school. Me and my friends loved it. At first it might seem like a little kids game but you need strategy to play this game and that is what makes it fun. The game is perfect for anyone from a beginner like one of my friends who played the game at school to an experienced player like me. I would recomend that you get this game if you can't decide which ""Backyard"" game to get (and that is coming from a baseball fan)."
4,AAAwwweeesssooommmeee!,The plays are much more advanced than the previous version. I was a little disappointed in how they didn't put on the old players. But I was still happy how they put on some new players. They do celebration dances in the end zone that really crack me up!
3,Fun but go with madden or primetime,The playbooks in this game are the BEST. But no season mode and limited replay value make this game no fun after a few months. But an online mode may extend life for a while longer. You should rent this game because you'll get a lot out of it but won't waste money on something that you wont play after a few weeks
4,More fun than the original,"BYF 2002 is a really good game for kids that love football. I have two sons (6 and 4) that enjoy it tremendously.Seeing the game from this perspective has helped them understand the sport a little better.Their only complaints are that there are no pro receivers, and some players (Cade McNown) that they don't recognize.We've had one problem. We have an iMac and lately the game has been shutting down around the third quarter. I don't know if this is a bug or if they have been treating the game a little too rough and it has some scratches."
4,great game - loved it!,This is lots of fun - good alternative to wii-fun games. I like the people featured (players) and had fun playing against computer - it's a blast!
3,Still pondering !,"I am still at a loss as to whether I like this movie or not. If Loni Anderson's portrayal of the real Jayne Mansfield is accurate, Loni did a brilliant job. I can understand why Jayne's career really never took off, hence only making approximately some 12-14 movies - her public persona showed her to be a dizzy blonde which probably limited her opportunities in the eyes of the Hollywood moguls. I'll watch it again in perhaps another 18 months - shelved for the moment."
4,A Mike Stern Fave,I'm a drummer and follow David Weckl where'r he goes. So I knew this album would be good from the start. I also find this album to be one of Mike Stern's best ('Is what it is' is another excellent one) - it blends the best of his melodic (mostly minor tendencies) with the occasional leadfoot on the distortion pedal to tread a very interesting jazz/rock line.My only reservation is Mike's solos can get to be a little in sameness - even live at the Continental I was almost otherwise distracted at times wishing he'd get on with it and make a point.Nevertheless excellent jazz/fusion. Highly recommended.
1,Mystic-Realization,"Order this if you are at the farthest point on the mystic side. Mr. Jackson-Bear makes a long series of Self-Realization statements which he evidently feels are profound. After each statement he gives a long pause, perhaps, he feels that you will need this time to understand what he has said. Further, he ""The Star"" poses with a huge smile appreciating his own statement. Make no mistake; this DVD is solely about mystic self-realization with the barest mention of the Enneagram."
1,never got my item,I never got my game boy advance sp power max ac adaptor.so i can't review and thing.
5,One of the best!,"""The Gold of Cape Girardeau"" is a wonderful story that successfully combines fiction with history. You fall in love with the characters and become unable to put the book down. It has an intriguing plot that mixes the past with modern day. You go back through time and become a part of Lindy's and John's world, laughing when they laugh, crying when they cry. It evokes all your emotions and touches your heart. It is truly one of the best!"
2,Haleys Hints?,"I was looking forward to getting this book especially after watching the PBS special, but I was so disappointed. I was really looking for good products for cleaning products(which I haven't found yet). I think that if he transcribed the show that he does for PBS and sells that he will have a much better book. I would only recommend this book if you already have some good home care books in your collection. This is not a particularly good choice for the modern family."
5,Haley's Hints,This book answers many questions that are otherwise hard to find. We bought two different books. They are very helpful.
1,"Common Knowledge Material, Low Content","Most of these many hints, are common knowledge. There was only a few surprises. I returned this book without hesitation after trying to find more than a few worthy ideas. I consider the book to be 95 percent filler.Some examples,Hint: Insulating the hot water pipes saves energy. Wow.Hint: Rotating your tires, will make them last longer.Hint: Using a roll back thermostat saves energy.Hint: Alternate wearing two pairs of shoes, makes them last longer.Sorry, I was not impressed. I believe those who are handy-person types will agree, this book does not command the going price."
5,WONDERFUL - FULL OF GREAT INFORMATION,This is a great book. I didn't know so many common household items could be used in such an effective way. I have tried several cleaning suggestions for around my house and my friends and relatives are really impressed!ThanksD. BurrowCamino CA
3,Great ideas but needs a better writer,I like using Haley's books but the challenge that I find is that who ever wrote them needs a few more writing classes. Several of the how to's are just too limited in explanation. But still glad that I have the books.
5,Great book to go to...........,"Haley's hints is a great book to go to for finding how-to information. It has been very helpful when I know there's a better way to clean something when the over-the-counter products are not performing, or when I don't have them on-hand. This book will save you time and money and you'll go to it often."
4,Haley's Hints,Very informative and gives cleaning instructions that probably wouldn't be found in many places.
3,Somewhat outdated information,"It was very helpful in some regards, the author uses vinegar for many of the hints. We noticed in each chapter there were hints that were not needed in todays world. Outdated with technology. The only real problem is some of the chemicals suggested were not easily found if at all. (Borax) A good book for anyone wanting to have a reference."
2,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"This album is a huge disappointment because of Jimi Jamison's vocals. To say he had an ""off night"" is an understatement. Survivor is one of my four favorite bands and I've seen them in concert several times. I've never heard Jimi sound anything like this. He missed more notes than he hit. Surely there are other recorded concerts that could have been released as a live album. The rest of the album sounds fine. This concert was obviously in support of their Vital Signs album but I would like to hear a live album that has some songs from When Seconds Count and Too Hot To Sleep. Maybe the band can put something together from a concert supporting Reach. I am not aware of any other live CDs from Survivor - that is the only reason I can imagine purchasing this train wreck."
1,Bad vocals,"I love Survivor and I was looking forward to this cd.What a disappointment.Jim Jamison's voice is so strained,he has a hard time to stay in tune and most of the time he can not. It is hard to listen these great songs like this.Sound like an amateur band.Buy the studio albums,not this awful live cd."
5,Survivor Extended versions: The Encore Collection,Jimi Jamison the voice of survivor brings a crisp rock sound like no other this collection is mainly the songs used for the encores at the end of concerts really great songs Im not that Man Anymore is one of my favorites very rich vocals . Susan King
5,An essential cookbook for Christmas...,"I've had this cookbook for the last 15 years. I think my sister gave it to me one year at Christmas. I once ate at the Lion House in SLC for someone's wedding, and it was incredible.This is an excellent cookbook for those who need to cook for crowds. There were always crowds in Utah...it's kind of self-explanatory. So the women learned to cook in great amounts, but that didn't mean they didn't cook well. I've used many of the beverages, especially the hot ones, for all kinds of get-togethers. Even adolescents appreciate a nice hot cup of apple cider/wassail in the fall after playing football. For those who prefer to find comfort in each other's company, rather than drinking alcohol, this book provides the beverages and the desserts (so many tend to have alcohol at Christmastime) without the problems.Many of the recipes are simple, good food. A great cookbook for a beginning cook, or for someone who aspires to entertaining well.Karen Sadler"
4,Good mix of songs,"'In This World' is my favorite track from 18. It samples an older song (one of Moby's signature movements) and the instrumentation is fine-tuned dancey, yet ambient. The two b-sides included go well with this track. 'Piano & Strings' sort of continues the great piano work from the first track. 'Downhill', a good song though a few minutes too long, takes the CD into a more ambient atmosphere. Although now people can get the 18 B-sides, this is still a great mix of songs for people to really take in the music."
1,CHEAPLY MADE!!,Do your self the favor and do not order any thing from brand on sale!! I have had to many bad experiences with this company!There pictures on line look NOTHING like what you recieve.
5,"Informative, Witty, and Beautifully Written","I've been looking for a way to jazz up my undergraduate statistics course. On a whim, I bought a copy of Wainer's ""Graphic Discovery."" What a treat! This is a book that should be required reading for every undergraduate in psychology. Beautifully typeset and written, loaded with interesting and important examples, the book manages to be entertaining and informative without being condescending or simplistic. Wainer has a real gift for elegant, succinct writing. Highly recommended!James H. Steiger, ProfessorDept. of Psychology and Human DevelopmentVanderbilt UniversityNashville, TN 37203"
3,Graphic Discovery,"Howard Wainer is an entertaining writer. However, much of this feels like a rehash of things that he has written elsewhere."
1,What not to do,"If you're interested in wasting time, playing games, frustrating people, and attracting guys who know how to work the Rules then buy this book. On the other hand, if you're interested in meeting good, solid and sincere people avoid any advice these authors have to give with the exception of personal safety. This book teaches women how to act disinterested, aloof and unavailable - the perfect way to disuade Mr. Right from contacting you again. Perhaps the worst advice in this book is limiting yourself solely to men who respond to your ad."
1,Is this a joke? Please tell me it is....,"This is the worst drivel of nonsense I have ever seen. First, any man with an IQ over 100 will know you are trying to play games, screw with his head, and immediately dump you. Second, (unless you like really dumb guys - some women do) the content is shockingly wrong. It will result in you looking pathetic, if you do indeed meet a man they will be a complete dork most likely, or some macho fool who wants to prove he can `get' you, and you would basically self-destruct any chance you might have of finding someone worthy of you (if you ARE an amazing woman).Take my advice: Any Rules books are for laughter only and the sad, pathetic compassion you should feel for the Yenta authors. I have them because they ARE so funny. But take them seriously at your own risk.Damon"
2,here we go again....,"This is the Rules applied to the web. So if you've read the original rules, all their advice applies here via online. Again we're dealt with common sense advice, that was dished out on the Rules, except this time you'll hear ""don't date a guy without a photo."" Its obvious that the authors are writing it just to make money and btw, isn't the author in divorce court? I believe so, and why would you want to take advice from someone that's divorcing? Enough said."
1,bunk!,bunk!do what u want when it comes to dating.like duh?i think the ruls book does have some common sense in it but then it goes off the deep end with some real nutty behavior suggested.if you do want to read this book-pick it up at your local library.and check it out with the mind-set that this is a total humor book. only.
4,Interesting,For someone new to online dating this info could be helpful. It's all about snaring a man off a dating site. It's different.
1,I have no Idea what it's for but it did not fit.,It did not fit the the unit and the strap is too long even if it did.I have no Idea what it was for but I found it unusable so I ended up tossing it in thetrash.
2,Is it working?,I got this installed and it was working great at first. But not even two months and the display went blank on me. Professional car audio store owner told me that it was probably still working. Keeping it installed and not knowing for sure that it's working properly leaves me to conclude that this was a regretful purchase and maybe an optima battery or even a good brand capacitor would have been a better choice. I will not recommend the Pyle brand.
4,Nice intro to the martial arts,"This video is instructional for 34 minutes and then there is a 10 minute interview with the instructor. Matt is a very good instructor and introduces you to about the first 10 forms of tai chi. Before beginning the forms lessons there is a short 5-10 minute Qi Gong energy building exercises.Each of the forms are done repetitiously about three times. Each demonstration builds upon the first until the last segment in which you practice the forms in succession as a fluid tai chi movement.The only thing I don't like about this video and it seems to be with most, all the poses are given from the front view only. There was a you tube video I saw that had the instructor demonstrating in front of a dance studio mirror so that you were able to not only see the whole form, but also become oriented correctly as to left and right. This is very difficult to overcome viewing in the front position only.Great introduction to the martial arts and recommended."
2,Avoid Instant Video purchase,"If you purchase this item on Amazon Instant Video, you only get one of the two programs. Further there is no menu and no efficient way to move between routines. Might be OK for complete novices but not much use for someone looking to customize a workout."
5,Excellent Video,"I was thinking about buy this video online but had already paid for two DVDs by a well known TV actor so I thought I would wait. While waiting I was at a local store and saw that they had this and its companion Qi Gong video on one DVD and purchased it. I liked the TV actors old TV show but Matthew Cohen's demonstrations and guidance are far superior. You can tell that he feels the energy during his demonstrations and he gives excellent descriptions of visual imagery in his mind and instructions without being theatrical. He gives his demonstrations in mirror form, and while there may be slightly different camera angles to better show forms, they are all from the front without being confusing by jumping from front to back views."
2,NOT for people with arthritis or balance issues,"To be prefectly frank, I stopped watching the video about 10 minutes in. When he started standing on one leg with that knee bent, I knew I couldn't do his routine. I've got arthritis in many of my joints and am looking for something to start incorporating gentle movements into an exercise routine. While his routines may be ""basic"" from a martial arts perspective, they are not for someone with any physical or balance issues."
1,Enamel broken off 2 roasters.,"I ordered this roaster as a birthday present and some of the enamel was broken off when I received it. I returned it for an identical item and the second roaster arrived with enamel broken off. Both the shipping carton and the interior box appeared to be in good condition with no signs of damage. Therefore, I think the broken enamel is a defect of the manufacturer. I requested a refund of the second item and Amazon's customer service department was very efficient in processing my request."
1,Not an easy read,I will just say this:There are far superior books on XML than this one.Microsoft and Wrox do a better job.
1,Do NOT buy,The book was required as the text for an XML course. The authors thrown in too much additional info that is not pertinent to the subject matter. The source code for the chapter problems is not on the CD and it should be. Also the course code and book examples are wrong. The example code in the book is taken from screen shots and is difficult to read. I highly recommend obtaining an XML book other than this one. I would not even give this one star but I had to input something to rate it.
2,BEWARE - PCM AUDIO IS MONO,"What a bummer - a great concert spoiled by a mono mix - if you don't have surround sound, I would pass on this DVD until they resolve this problem. The power of Metallica's sound is dependent on having James in one ear and Kirk in the other, or else it sounds like a lot of mush. Plus you'll also notice the drums and vocals are really loud like they made the PCM audio out of two the surround tracks."
5,happy customer,"real good concert i love it , i bought for my self it sounds, looks real good thanks i love it"
4,"Spicey, diverse, rockin, cheap, and lengthy","It's about time Estrus did a cheapo sampler. Seems like every other half-cocked ""punk"" label in existance has already ridden this particular gravy train till the wheels fell off. Well this one is darn sure worth it. 26 songs that rock in every great garage method possible. All the big boys are here: Makers, Mono Men, Nomads, MOAM, Drags, and many more. And for a measly five bills, you get some very rockin tunes. And the treat is that the disc gets better as it goes along. Even if you aren't a huge garage freak (or especially, if you are) this is a great way to sample the best from a wide array of top bands. Not to sound like an infomercial, but you simply cannot go wrong! Buy Buy Buy!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Unfortunately, another ""don't waste your money"" Does everyone with a video camera think they are qualified to do a travel film??? Or does it have something to do with vacation travel & tax write offs? I don't know but this is another example of bad production, sound, visuals, content... Sorry for being harsh but I was excited to order this (video/dvd material on the subject of Sicily is hard to find) and looking forward to receiving it and then was really let down. Don't waste your money!"
1,Upset customer,"After recieving the wrong order I called customer service, they instructed me to ship the wrong package back and they would send the right one. It should have been a pre paid return label and I should not have had to pay shipment. That was not the case, after recieving the package back I called customer service again, yet again instructed me to send the wrong order back. Also told me if I didn't send it back in a reasonable amount of time they would charge me for the wrong order. Again I recieve the package back. All together I recieved the wrong package back 3 times and finally paid for shipment just so they wouldn't charge my credit card. After calling customer service they told me that they had given me all the discounts they could, I'm not sure what discount I got but I don't remember it!"
1,Old Technology,Would not recognize or run the tapes from my HD camcorder. I sent it back the next day!
3,awesome toy,"i love this telescope. you should know this thing is a monster when it comes to weight. I don't have a designated place for it, so i have to move it in and out of the house, it can be a pain in the a**. but the optics so far are amazing. light gathering power is amazing. it is pricey but if it keeps performing the way it has, it's worth it. i took some photos of the moon and jupiter with it, i will post them. I am an amateur amateur photographer and stargazer, the photos are not as good as some taken by some of the more seasoned folks.Reason for 3 stars? well, star align was the reason why I chose this particular telescope, and it doesn't work. I have looked up and read a lot about this problem, and unless you have a very big sky where the weak GPS system can get signal through, you won't be able to star align. hills around your house, mountains near by or tall walls around the yard will hinder the star alignment, BE AWARE! otherwise, spend the green and enjoy :)"
4,"Nice, Concise, But Don't Go Without a Topo!","This map and its Southern Counterpart are almost all you need to plan your trip into the the Wind River Mountains. Two maps covering the entire range gives you a great overview of what is there and where the trails are. But, beware! The marked trails on these maps are not 100% accurate. There are many red dashed lines on these maps that represent trails that do not exist - I know, I've looked for some of them! Use this map to plan, but go ahead and order the topos from USGS for the area that you plan to hike. They're much more detailed and in most cases more accurately represent the actual trail locations. All good girlie scouts use Earthwalk Press maps AND USGS 7.5 Minute topos."
4,Great value,"You can't go wrong with this when the price is so low. The animation quality is like that typically seen in basic Saturday morning cartoons, which is good enough for kids. What I like is that all the videos in this series give all the important details of the story, rather than giving a shallow, watered-down version as is usually the case in children's stories. These will entertain preschoolers up through junior high and the script is very closely based on the scriptural account. Each video is 45-50 minutes long, and this double feature has two such videos on the disc. The only reason I didn't give this series a 5 is that each video has a hokey song that could definitely have been left out, but for such a low price and good script, I can overlook that."
2,"Great band, weak compilation","La Ley is one of the best pop rock bands in Latin America. However, this album, which was released as a compilation of the band's works, falls short of showcasing the band's work in all their splendor. You are better off getting a copy of just about any of their albums: truly, it's hard to go wrong with them. So I don't know who would be responsible for picking tracks on this compilation, but they are doing the guys a disservice."
3,Would have worked better in the smaller format:,"While as with most Putnam books, there is a wealth of information that has never before been published in the West, the larger page format that Putnam adopted for its later books simply does not work well here.Putnam's earlier books (including ""Japanese Aircraft of the Pacific War""), with their 8-3/4 x 5-3/4 page size, were much better at presenting the data in ""encyclopedic"" books like this one; the larger page size should be reserved for books with a running narrative. At the very least, the three-column-per-page format should be replaced with one or two columns.I hope that, if someone puts the Putnams back in print, that they re-format this book, and similar Putnams with encyclopedic listings of aircraft, in the 8-3/4 x 5-3/4 page size, which would make this book much more pleasant to use!"
5,Coro's is #1 Always!,"I'am Coro's #1 fan and, I love all his songs no matter what anyone may think I find Coro to be my #1 Freestyle singer."
4,a good find,"Baz Luhrmann's ""Strictly Ballroom"", ""Romeo and Juliet"" with Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio, and ""Moulin Rouge"" with Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, are included in this set. Luhrmann's unique directorial style is delightfully showcased in these films and it is intersting to note his progression in developing his craft through the films.I gave it a 4 because ""Strictly Ballroom"" isn't as good as the latter two films, although still worth a watch or two."
1,Brababy BREAKS right out of the box,"The second Brababy fell apart in the wash and the bra was ruined.If the BraBaby were actually in a retail store, I would have been able to see how flimsy it is, and I would not have purchased it. Not only did it break on me, but my bra straps came right out of the large holes and snagged with other clothing. Save your money - it costs nearly as much to send it back as its online price."
1,Cheap material,"The latch broke during the first use. And, they claim that it can go in the dryer, but it melted the first time I put it in the dryer."
1,too small by half,"If you wear a bra size up to maybe a B cup this would be great, but anything bigger and the BraBABY is just to small. I managed to get my bra in sideways but the clasp immediately broke in the first washing. Definitely not worth the money, but if they could make one a more practical size..."
2,Bar Baby is made for Baby Bras,"This is only made for people that wear small cup bras A or B,it is impossible to put even a C cup bra in it."
2,"brababy, bra baby","It did what it was supposed to do, and my bras came out of the wash without any weird creases. However, some bras hold up better in the washing machine than others, and I think the one I put into the BraBABY was one of the more durable ones.While it does what it's supposed to, it definitely is not easy to use. I had difficulty putting a B-size cup in without squishing the bra. The clasp is also badly designed. If it breaks, it's not a big deal to tie the outer ball closed, but the whole thing is poorly engineered. I think it was made even harder seeing as how I tried using the BraBABY with a front-closing racer back.In the end, I think it would have been easier and just as effective to use a lingerie bag.I don't recommend this product."
1,Disappointed,"After less than 2 weeks, the item broke. The bras dont completely fit in there, and a few times it came unlocked in the washer, so it became pointless. And then after a week and a half, the locking part broke off."
1,Satin Bras got scratched up,"I ordered two sets of BraBABY Bra Washing Holders. When they arrived, there was no statement/invoice/receipt inside the box. I used them today to wash three bras. It was tricky to get the straps in the ball. When the washing machine was on, I can hear the balls bouncing around in it. When the wash was finished, and the bra straps were sticking out of the balls. My bras have some satin on the edge. The satin were all scratched up, probably from all that bouncing around. I am very disappointed."
1,Broke on first wash,"I saw that there were mixed reviews for this product before I bought it, but I decided to take a chance on it anyway. Unfortunately, both balls broke their first time through the wash. My bras fell out and got squished and creased. Don't buy this!!!"
1,Bra buster,"Similar to others, straps fell through vents and got caught on other items in the wash. Also, the outer shell has sharp edges on the inside, which caused pills and small tears in the bra."
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"After seeing the amount of time it takes for my girlfriend to handwash her bras, I was excited to buy brababy after seeing it on Amazon. However, it's completely useless! She was really disappointed because the bra straps tangled and fell right through the gaping holes that are almost 3 inches wide. She had to squish her bra in because it barely fits in the plastic, and so it's probably impossible for ladies with larger sizes. The cheap plastic on the latch broke off and fell to the ground, and the rest of the plastic is very flimsy. My girlfriend and I wish we would have passed on this product because we waited eagerly for it to arrive, but now it's new home is in the trash. She wanted me to write this review and warn others about it."
1,Very Disappointed,This product has holes so large that it allows bra straps to escape during the wash. The locking mechanism also breaks easily and the plastic is not durable. It didn't protect my bras at all.
1,Do not buy this!!!!!,"I spend hundreds of dollars a year on bras and intimate items and decided to try the brababy vs a laundry bag. this product RUINED my bras. It caused lumps in the padding and after the second use, fell apart. I would not purchase this product again!"
1,completely ineffective,"I also had a problem with the straps coming out of the holes in the container and getting tangled up with the other clothes in the washer. Secondly, my B sized bra has lightly padded cups. Even though I followed the directions on how to arrange the bra in the BraBABY, by the end of the wash cycle, the whole bra was wadded up in one side of the BraBABY. I don't know if women with larger bra cups may not have that problem."
1,BraBaby,"I bought this item from Bed,Bath and Beyond. It broke apart and ruined my very expensive bra. I tried it again, with an old cheap bra-thinking I had somehow done it incorrectly the first time, same thing happened. Both of my bra's were ruined. Waste of plastic!"
2,Less than impressed,"I found this product after seeing it lauded on The Today Show and it appeared to be a GREAT idea. However, I had a lot of difficulty getting the back and strap porting of the bra into the BraBABY and they were pretty tangled when I later took the bras out. I also have to wonder how a larger bra would work, considering I'm merely a B cup and it was a tight fit. In theory, I think it's an excellent idea. In truth, I think it still needs work. Additionally, although the advertisement claims that you can put them in the dryer, one out of two of mine opened in the dryer both times I've used them - even drying on gentle cycle. It did maintain the shape of the cup and the underwire throughout the wash spin cycle - a plus. I hope they keep working on the strap and ease of insertion issue."
1,what a disappointment,"I was really excited about this product, because I like to buy quality bras that last a long time and I wanted them to stay looking new even after I washed them. But, the first time I used this product it broke and completely destroyed one of favorite bras. I should have known before I used it, because it looked like it was made really cheaply. I would never recommend this item to anyone."
1,"Skip this, not helpful.","This book is no where near helpful enough for the life of a REAL teen mom who has to overcome the stigma of being a teen mom. I wouldn't recommend it at all. Instead I would choose ""You look too young to be a mom"" because in reading the stories of these teen mamas or former teen mamas you can not only be enlightened but empowered too."
2,questionable purchase,"I enjoyed it, my students in Brit Lit were less than enthusiastic. I may try using it again in class. BTW, it's basically a narrated powerpoint slide show. Production value is about a 4 out of 10."
2,"OK Nuts, Nothing Special","These peanuts were a little bland, almost stale tasting. They didn't have the freshness that I like, but that is probably because they don't contain any preservatives. They do have a substantial amount of salt on them, which adds to the flavor."
3,"Good Virginia Peanuts, but could use more salt","Don't get me wrong - I'm not addicted to salt and I actually never add salt to anything that I eat, but I expected these nuts to taste like Whitley's famous Virginia Peanuts and they just don't. They could use a little more salt. They also taste a little over blanched -- it's hard to describe. For virginia peanuts, however, these are a good value. I'm afraid, however, that I'm headed back to Stew Leonards for their version of these Virginia Peanuts -- they taste more like Whitleys."
5,Brilliant x 3!!!,DVD's you can watch over and over again and get something new out of them each time. I Love the extras too. Highly recommended
5,Very good!,"Good overviews. Use them to show my kids. Not the highest budget films in the world (when compared to Discovery Channel or History channel films), but informative!"
5,Excellent Source for Wisdom,"This collection contains three great DVDs.Intelligent Design is a complex topic, but these videos do a excellent job at simplifying the message into something that you can grasp.I love watching these videos.Each of them strengthen each other.They are a great group of DVDS on Intelligent Design."
5,Intelligent Design - awesome DVD set,These are a great set of DVD's for people who are interested in learning more about the Intelligent design theories. HIghly recommend!!
4,Needs more songs,"Tracy Lawrence live is a great album,although I think it's a bit too short.It would have been nice to have had more than ten tracks on here.I know it was early in his career,but if he recorded ""I Threw The Rest Away"" for this,which wasn't even a single,then there were other album cuts that he could have recorded for this as well.Many of which,at the time,were alot better than ""I Threw The Rest Away"".Overall,this is still a great album because it's Tracy Lawrence,and I still recommend it."
1,DashMat Review,"The item was listed correctly when I ordered it but when it was processed it came out came out as a wrong item. I wanted the original Daskmat but got the Signature series, which is NOT what I ordered. To make this worse you don't allow responses to your emails and that is a huge probelms when you have a problem."
5,Seminal Country Record,"Ron Elliot and Sal Valentino devised an exquisite record. Along with _Triangle_, perhaps some of the best American rock of their time. Literate, intelligent, subtle, and quite unknown.It's great that both Bradley's Barn and Triangle have been released on CD. I think that the wonderful critic Richie Unterberger may have had something to do with this. If so, thanks Richie."
3,Review of advanced techniques,This book is OK if you are a Pro/e user with moderate experience. It explains about start parts - which I've found to be lacking in all the proe users I've met for exaample. Also the assembly techniques are ok. I would take exception to the book being aimed at advanced users. Anyone who has used proe extensively will find this book unfulfilling. Also it contains little or no reference to sheetmetal.
3,Where is the Phantom?,Universal's 100th Anniversary has caused them to reissue and restore some great films. But no silent films including the Phantom Of The Opera....why does Universal continue to ignore the film?
4,List of movies that are included,Here is the list of movies that are included in this set:All Quiet on the Western Front (1930)American Graffiti (1973)Apollo 13 (1995)Back to the Future (1985)The Birds (1963)The Bourne Identity (2002)The Breakfast Club (1985)Buck Privates (1941)Despicable Me (2010)Do the Right Thing (1989)Dracula (1931)E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)The Fast and the Furious (2001)Field of Dreams (1989)Jaws (1975)Jurassic Park (1993)Mamma Mia! The Movie (2008)National Lampoon's Animal House (1978)Out of Africa (1985)Pillow Talk (1959)Scarface (1983)Spartacus (1960)The Sting (1973)To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)Schindler's List (1993) (DVD version only)Dracula Spanish (1931) (Blu-ray version only)
2,Huh?,"Solely based on the fact that the package will include the horrid DePalma Scarface (1982), The Bourne Identity (though a great movie but not ground breaking in any way except proving Damon can play action roles) and The Fast and the Furious (why?) this really is one package to stay away from in my opinion."
3,"Everybody say ""cheese!""","This is a rather uneven Christmas album. The standout track is the great, funny ""Merry Christmas From the Family"" by Jill Sobule. There are some other good performances here, but nothing great. The lowlight is the seemingly endless 8 minute long jazz saxophone version of ""White Christmas"" by James Carter. This CD is almost worth getting just for the Jill Sobule song."
4,To be continued,"Admittedly, this is not a proper review, but I just wanted to convey a quick ""thank you"" to the person who felt her voice was important enough to meddle with the one recorded version the world has of Tori's Little Drummer Boy.More from http://thedent.com/sleigh.html#littledrummerboy ...The Little Drummer Boy was recorded live on November 12, 1992 at a club in Dundalk, Maryland called Steel Town. Tori asked the crowd for silence, saying that the song would be recorded for a children's charity benefit. Of course, there was a woman who had to shout ""play it, Tori"" in response to the ""shall I play for you"" line. The bouncers quickly took care of her but, in a way, she had ruined the mood -- at least for some of those in her immediate surroundings..."
5,Mindy Starns Clark is a winner,"Good mysteries! I would read her books any day. It has been a while since I read this one, but I do remember that I liked it!!"
3,"Interesting, but not authentically Christian","I enjoyed reading the story of Penny for Your Thoughts and found it drew me into the story. However, having read other Christian authors who weave into their work authentic principles of the Christian life, I found this author falls short in that department. She seems to tack on a Bible verse occasionally in order to call it Christian fiction. I am not a devotee of fiction, so perhaps my expectation is higher than the average reader of such. Today there seems to be a real opening for the use of fiction to convey the reality of life in right relationship to God which can be a great tool for at least pre-evangelism. I may read another of this author's work to be sure I give her the benefit of the doubt, but I cannot say this one fulfilled my expectations."
3,"Love this stuff, but shipping $$$!!!! Really?","In the age of UPS, FedEx, DHL, and USPS, it's beyond ridiculous that I should be charged more for the shipping on this than for the product. This stuff is great, but it seems like the company sending it to you is more interested in gouging you on shipping than anything else."
2,Loses It's Carbonation Too Quickly,"The soda loses its carbonation too quickly like a cheap store brand generic soda. Essentially the soda is a cherry flavored drink...not maraschino/grenadine cherry like other cherry flavored sodas or products with 'cherry' flavor added (i.e. Cherry Dr. Pepper, Cherry Coke)...but Cheerwine taste like real pitted cherries. The soda has the darker red color like a real cherry, not the bright red syrup/food coloring look. I like the real cherry favor idea behind the soda; however, you cannot finish a can or bottle without to going totally flat. I assume they have to cut corners to complete with their massive corporation competitors."
3,3 Star beverage.....,"Cheerwine is a cherry flavored carbonated drink. The cherry flavor is light and not as powerful as one might expect. It's lack of intensity is the only reason I give it 3 stars. I am a full flavored, give me something to sink my teeth into, kind of drinker. However, despite my tendencies, I still purchase Cheerwine when lighter is what I am after. Extremely hot days, for example. Too much flavoring and sweetness can make me ill and Cheerwine is at its' best during those types of days. Being a North Carolina regional drink, it makes perfect sense. After all, hot balmy days can run from May through mid September there. For a spectacular combo, try Cheerwine with Red Velvet Cake for dessert. Now talk about cuisine, that combo is truly top notch. The tastes compliment each other in a way that produces a wonderful 6 star experience."
5,Strong Commentary on James,"Baukham has a great commentary here, dealing with many critical issues of history and exegesis. Not a lot of fluff, and not a lot of ""Osteen's devotions"" kinda comments here. If you're seriously studying James, you need this and the Pillar NT offering by Doug Moo (not forgetting MacArthur, Lenski, Kistemaker, NIGTC, NIVAC, NICNT, BST, R. Kent Hughes and both the 1st and 2nd version of The Expositors). Study the Bible like it's THE Bible!"
4,Gibby standin naked in a freezing Detroit morning? Priceless,"This captures the 'Holes just a few years before the peak of their live performances (the traveling circus of lasers & smoke machines & upside-down films & Katherine the mute trancing centerstage...) Great performances of material through ""Psychic...Powerless"". In between songs, an exasperated interviewer attempts to get the goods as the band lounges together in a motel bed with Mark Farner and a siamese cat. It's a side splitter."
5,goddamn yeah!,the dance hit of the century! mr quintron is like the devil but cooler and he's got all the best tunes.
4,Wiiiiiiilllllldddddd....,"This album is crazy in the best of ways. The few and far between lyrics are as disorienting as the music. Tracks 2, 3, and 4 are true keepers, but all are enjoyable if you keep an open mind. Not for the normal. BTW, try listening to the tracks in their numbered order on the back. It strips the album of its novelty approach and makes it more real. Depends on how you like it, though."
2,"Quintron is great, this album...not so much","I consider myself a fan of Quintron. His live shows are not to be missed. They're full of energy, and scatting, and inexplicable noises. I bought all the albums up to this one, and I must say I was disappointed.The earlier albums were fantastic. They contained a good mix of odd grooves and what-the-hell-is-that. This album though I thought was lacking a lot of the energy that made Quintron great. It also had some serious stinkers that I just couldn't stomach. ""It's Moving Me,"" for example -- yeah, the whole song sounds like that. I ended up selling this CD for a couple bucks.If you're interested in Quintron I'd recommend you steer clear of this one and pick up one of the earlier gems. ""Satan Is Dead"" is good as is ""The Amazing Spellcaster"" and ""IF 001-011"" (if you can find it anymore)."
1,This book is a false teaching.,"There is only one way to prepare for death and that is with Jesus, no other way will get you into heaven, and certianly not anything that is taught in this book. It is a lie..."
3,The miracle of death,"Although the poems in this book (2) portray themselves as delving deep into the eternal mystery of auto-necrophilia, the actual coverage of said topic is sadly lacking. One may ask oneself - how does a dead person engage in intercourse with one's own self? Offhand, I would say that such a process is impossible. Of course, it can be done (with the right tools) but Mr. Knott does not enlighten the eager reader on this vast topic. One final note - where did Mr. Knott get his pictures for this book? The activities there preserved on photographic film are illegal in this country (except for Nevada) Is there no justice?"
5,the last amusing woody allen film,"""a midsummer night's sex comedy"", written, directed, and starringwoody allen was his last truly amusing film. portraying a wackyinventor, who true to allen's screen love life, is also wracked withregret for former lovers, fulfills the history of human comedy &tragedy. the cast is perfect, the scenery tranquil, and the pace ofthe film is excellent. subsequent allen films seem to depressing,unamusing, and lacking in emotion. for a good time, watch this film. it was the last one allen made that will bring a chuckle,smile, and amusement to you."
4,The Statistical Abstract,"This book is traditionally the most authoritative, comprehensive one-volume collection of the latest facts and figures on the economic, political and social structure of the United States.

5,The movie that hit the nerve,"A movie as never affected me so deeply and made me feel in a way that I can't put into words.Watching this movie as affected my life in a positive way and changed my outlook on life.I feel that this movie is deeply emotional, if you had a difficult childhood yourself, it might even help you emotionally, like it did me.At the end of this film tears were running down my eyes...Toby Whaymandreisebok.com"
3,"Great Quality, heavy product","I can not deny that the quality of this product is superior, as well as the quality of the sound. Using AAA battery in an earphone is not a good idea i guess. It makes it heavy to carry around the nick. About the noise canceling feature is pretty good, not great but you get what you are paying for."
4,Philips noise-cancelling earbuds,"They do the job but don't have as much power as Sony's do. Then again, Sony's cost twice as much.Big plus - they come with airplane adapter."
2,Less than impressed,"The noise canceling is just barely discernible in comparison to when it is turned off and the music quality is not comparable to other earbuds in this price range ($60 list, $35 Amazon). The cloth wrapped cords seem like a nice feature for making them a bit more rugged, but I don't like the way the cords are arranged which create this loop that you put your head into (combined with the stronger cord, better not wear them around machinery since getting them caught will likely result in something a bit more painful than just having the earbuds yanked out of your ears)."
3,mediocre headphones,"Pros: Sound quality is good, earbuds are really comfortable. The buds stay in your ear with most types of motion.Cons: Some may not like the neck strap. The cord gets tangled. Volume is not very loud, needed to turn up volume.Noise cancellation seems to just turn up the volume, not sure how effective they really are. Havent tried them on a plane yet."
3,"good, but broke quickly","it was great, but the noise canceling didn't really work, the volume just seemed to get louder when the noise canceling was turned on, and eventually, the left earbud stopped working. in only about a month, too. i was disappointed."
3,"Poor seal in ear canal, low ANR","I've been traveling with these 'phones since my full earcup Philips ANR model died and burned my PC's headphone amp out. These stay put a lot better than earbuds, but no matter what I do, I can't get these to stay in the part of my ear canal where I get the best performance.These sound best when I put a finger on them to hold them in.With regard to ANR, after hearing Panasonic's sets at CES, I was stunned. More money, but CES is the loudest place on earth during that show. I walked over, held the -300 cup over my hear. The cups muffelled the noise. I turned on the ANR and the entire convention WENT AWAY. Maybe Panasonic pulled a fast one by tuning the demo circuit. If it didn't, I'm trying those next."
2,"Oh, for the love of less noise","Yes, the inserts bite - into the sides of your ear canal - but the technology is solid. We simply all have different width ear canals. Mine are very narrow, necessitating personal customizing of some inserts and special molds for some applications. I got the Philips at the blowout price of $7.95, and so couldn't pass it up (I've also got an ear-covering, and more bulky, Bose set). One bud hurts going in, and easily slides out. A touch of oil can help, but only if it doesn't also reduce friction (they'll fall out easier). Cut down the inner flange to try for a better fit. But be careful - your eardrum may not be as far in as you think!"
2,Not worth it,"These fit into my ear ok. However, the noise canceling feature not only produce the high pitched hissing sound I saw in another post but distorted many of the other sounds including the lows.. Very disappointed, I am returning them tomorrow. Also tried the Bose Triports and the sound is amazing, however these didn't fit into my ears very well. Hope this helps you decide not to get these ear buds because they aren't worth the money."
2,Very disappointing,"My first foray into the world of noise-cancelling in-ear headphones has been, to say the least, disappointing. I paid $A70 for this pair; a total waste of money. I perhaps should have opted for the more expensive Sony equivalent instead.I find the sound way too low. When I turn the volume up to how I like it, all I get is distortion.My $A27 Sennheiser MX550 h'phones absolutely destroy these.I'm not even going to bother to put them in my ears again."
2,"Not bad, but not worth $60","I bought these at Fry's because at $60, they were only $20 more than Apple's in-ear headphones and I figured that the sound-canceling feature was worth the extra price. Unfortunately, the sound canceling seems to only increase the volume, making it completely pointless. Instead, you're stuck with basically regular in-ear headphones with a big weight attached to them. Also, the materials used seemed extremely cheap. After a couple of weeks, the wire coming out of the bottom ripped out and I had to glue it back into place. I wouldn't really recommend these to anybody, since the sound quality wasn't much better than any other in-ear headphones."
1,Very High Priced Marginal Ear Buds,"Typically, I don't write such reviews, but I feel so cheated by Philips, I want to try and minimize the number of other people that will be cheated in the future.I purchased these Philips HN060 Earbuds for a recent international trip. The physical design and feel of the product is very smart. The key appeal to me was the compact physical size of the system. However, the noise cancellation feature does not work at all. On or off, there was no noise difference in the rumble of the jet engines. These things will end up in the trash and I'm going to buy a pair of noise-isolating earbuds."
1,"More like ""noise blocking""","I bought these for the commute (train). I am very unimpressed. Any noise reduction seems to come from the presence of tight-fitting plugs in your ears, rather than any electronic ""magic"". I can detect no difference in the background noise whether the noise-canceling circuit is turned on or off. The sound quality is poor either way. So this will be a returned product. The fact that replacement earplugs are unavailable seals the deal. The earplugs, while comfortable for me, are very thin and very soft. And very unlikely to stand up to daily use for very long."
4,Completely Satisfied,"I have searched everywhere for a pair of earphones that would fit properly in my ears. I have a very small ear canal and hurts to use the hard plastic ear buds (even the ones with the thin, foam bud protector). I work out in the mornings and it's discouraging to have to either fight through the pain in my ear or constantly keep adjusting the buds so they would fit properly.This product comes with three different bud sizes (sm, med, lg) the medium works well but starts to slide out after a period of time. The small fits like a glove! I did even use the noise cancelling feature for a period of time because the buds seal my canal from outside noise. However ever once I did, I was AMAZED! I hear Bose and a few other pricier options are better however this was really a great buy, especially for the price."
1,Uncomfortable,"The noise cancelling works just fine, but they constantly fall out and I found them uncomfortable after an hour or so. Mostly they sit at home and I use other headphones on flights now."
3,"Good sound, major snarl","The noise canceling feature works well for me, but the cord design confounds every attempt to slip them on quickly. They loop and snarl and every time I have to unravel the knots. The unit has a battery-powered amplifying device which adds weight. The ear buds are very comfortable but tend to come off."
2,Noise Canceling decent; music sound bad,"If you're not that picky about sound quality with music, then these may work for you. I think the frequency response range with these earbuds are pretty minimal. To me, the music is all mids. It's missing significant highs and lows for this price range.I gave these away to a friend who's not that picky at all, but she could tell a difference in sound quality right away. She normally uses the IPod earbuds which are uncomfortable to her. However, the noise canceling out weighs the sound quality so she prefers to use these earbuds over her Ipod buds riding a crowded train or bus.Hopefully I can find something affordable that has good frequency response. Or maybe I need to educate myself. Is it the frequency response, the impedence, or something else that covers the sound spectrum? I'm just looking for a good balance of lows, mids, and highs."
1,No real noise reduction,"These are comfortable and the audio is OK, but there is virtually no noise reduction noticeable. Used these on a flight recently and could tell no difference between having them on or off as far as noise reduction goes. By far the worst NR headphones I have tried. Definitely not worth the money."
1,"Noise altering, not noise cancelling","I tried using the headphones in the presence of machines that make a continuous backgroung humming noise. The noise level and character was similar to what you experience in an airplane. The headphones diminished the noise somewhat, but very little. It also creates its own (annoying to me) white noise and the sound quality was significantly poorer than that of a $10 pair of sony earbud headphones. In my opinion these Philips ""noise cancelling"" headphones are little more than a gimmick."
1,Phillips terrible,"These pop out of my ears constantly, I spend more time readjusting them that actually listening withn them. Sound was good, but not worth the constant hassle of moving them back into my ears. And if your using them doing any ting of activity , you will never keep them in. Cord is too heavy and puuls on plugs and the cird catching on everything including clothers hair, and pulls plugs out."
3,"Good quality sound, bulky ackward set up","I had these for a while before using them much. I got them for a trip, used them and then put them away before using them more as of late.I do think the sound from the ear buds is great, sound cancelling is decent considering there is nothing that can shield sound from your ears like over the ear style. However I can't get by the bulky thing that hangs around my neck just making these cumbersome, and the wires from the ear buds themselves stick out and look a bit goofy. Really though even around the house using them just to jam while doing normal chores, the foolish volume thing is a pain.I'm considering a pair of beats by dre, as they have really good reviews, and no hangy thing around the neck."
1,unflexible,"Got these earphones on clearance at Wal-Mart. As with other reviewers, the earbuds slip out of my ears rather easily. The noise cancelling function eats up AAA batteries quicker than I'd like. The biggest drag is that the rubber earbud ends kept coming off and the sound quality is terrible without them. I've now lost both of the rubber pieces and don't think that I can replace them."
1,Horrible,"I do not recommend these to anyone, spend the extra bucks and get the sony high performance ones."
2,Noise-cancelling newbie...,"...So I was satisfied with the noise-cancelling qualities. The cloth cable is very nice and doesn't tangle as much as the usual plastic ones. I liked not having to spend so much time untangling thes in the morning. The headphones I purchased come with 3 sizes of rubber cap earbud covers and I found only one to be suitable for my ears. Of course, after less than a month one of those earbuds fell off and now I can't use these earphones until I find a replacement somewhere, which is proving to be troublesome. Super. I didn't buy these on clearance at Target so that hurts my pocketbooks and I am very ANNOYED right now. In the meantime, I've returned to some $10 non-earbud headphones and I really miss the noise-cancelling quality of these Philips earbuds. Life sucks and I want to die because now I can hear everything going on around me during the morning commute on public transportation."
1,Don't buy,Don't buy this. It doesn't work and I tried returning it to Duane Reade and they won't take it back. I tried calling my credit card and Philips they won't take it either. I bought another noise cancelling headphones by Virgin for $50 and that works great. This is a cheap headphones not worth $5 bucks. It doesn't block out any noise and is uncomfortable to wear.
1,What they really meant by `noise-canceling'...,"I cannot believe how terrible these earphones are! I've had these earphones for two months. The only thing these earphones cancel is my ability to listen to music for longer than 5 seconds. And, from what I can tell from the 5 seconds they stay in my ear, the quality of the sound is terrible. I can also hear exterior noises (such as the AC vent above my cube...) Of course I can turn the volume up, but you can do that with any regular earphones without having to wear a battery pack around your neck, and these Philips earphones distort in the nastiest way at high volumes.I also waste a lot of time pushing the earbuds back into my ear, it's basically a second job since they absolutely refuse to stay in. As soon as they wiggle out ever so slightly the quality of sound deteriorates immediately, not that it has too much to deteriorate from to begin with. Please learn from my mistake, don't buy these earphones!!"
2,Poor Fit,"Like some of the other reviewers, I have found it impossible to use these headphones because they will not stay in for any period of time. In concept they are great, they sound good and do a respectable job of blocking noise, but since they won't stay in my ears, this is of little consequence. Furthermore, the rubber bits that fit in the ear come off very easily, another poor design trait. In fact, I'm on the phone with Philips right now to get replacments and their CS has been unhelpful. They just told me to buy replacements at Radio Shack &/or CompUSA, which is annoying b/c they are lost because of the poor design. Avoid these."
2,Don't Pay Extra,"I was very disappointed with these earbuds. The volume control must hang around you neck which is uncomfortable. The plastic part that goes into your ear falls off constantly. I finally lost one of them, which means the buds are useless. The sound really isn't much better than the pair that came with my iPod. I don't reccommend buying."
2,Avoid!!!!,"Just bought these and they are rubbish. Put simply, for music they are terrible. Absolutely no bottom end. At the maximum volume with my MP3 on full as well they are very quiet and cancel little noise. Infact ordinary earphones cancel more noise. For speech they are ok i guess. These really are worth avoiding though. A huge rip off. They barely stay in your ears. What a waste of my cash!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Better than nothing, barely","If you're looking for significant noise canceling activity, these are not the earbuds you want. There is a barely detectable decrease in outside noise when you switch them on. They mainly work by introducing a lot of background hiss and boosting the volume of the music. 10 dB ? Maybe if you glue them in with epoxy. Still, they are better than airline-supplied headsets. Just don't expect too much."
5,Great for the price,"I bought these for $19 at target, and they are well worth the price when you consider that Sony has ""regular"" headphones that go for the same price.They do indeed cancel out background low-frequency sound quite effectively. I am in a coffee shop now, and all I can hear are some vocal noises, and some high-pitched sounds behind the counter. I'm not even pushing any tunes through them at the moment, only using them for cancellation. And, contrary to what some have said, the noise reduction is not only due to the passive effect of having them in your ears. The switch does do something.I've used the Bose before, and they are amazing. However, given the price of these, I am more than happy with the quality. I'm not going to be spending more than $100 on headphones in the next ten years, to be sure."
2,Save your nickels...,"after having used them for a few days with my ipods, i have to say that they are just not worth the time and money.noise canceling is an overly ambitious statement, maybe some slight noise reduction, and most of that i suspect is from the silicon plugs used on the earbuds.the fidelity is simply not acceptable these days. i keep drifting back to my koss titanium set. light weight, good fidelity.if you really need serious noise canceling for regular train and plane travel, these are not the set for you. save your nickels a while longer and get something from the big boys...."
4,Not bad for the money.,"I purchased a set of these for flying and studying in noisy places. The advantage is that they are very small and fit easily in your ears. The earbud design is very comfortable - I have had earbuds before that cause my ears pain after an hour of listening. I can wear these for a whole 6 or 10 or 13 hour flight and they still feel good. They don't block all sounds, but for drone (like jet engines) they are fantastic. In fact, to test this, put them on, wear for a few hours on a plane, then switch them off - WOW THOSE ENGINES ROAR W/O THESE! Battery life is exceptional. I would like to try the BOSE or another high-end model to see if they are any better- but most are a lot more money!"
3,good enough at work,"I got these as a gift. I was unsure how the in-ear thing would work and if it would be comfortable. I was pleasantly surprised that it was comfortable enough to wear up to 6 hours a day.I listen to online talk radio and radio stations and the sound is fine for those.The noise cancelling works okay. It reduces the AC hum in my office building, but not so effective in a noisy airplane.If you don't like stuff in your ear canal these probably are not for you."
3,not a huge change,did not make a huge change in ambient noise on flight - comfort was ok and construction was good -
3,I wouldn't buy it.,"I own this product. They deliver excellent sound, but they have a very annoying neck strap, that you CANNOT GET RID OF.And, although everybody's ears are different, these really bothered me. The seal inside my ears was OK, but it could have been a lot better. Earbuds should fit snugly in the ear, and block a lot of sound without the noise canceling on. These headphones did not have long enough buds, so I had to push them in to get decent performance. But then the sharp plastic scraped at my ears because i had it so far in.I even had a friend try it, with the same results.So, these were pretty bad, but OKAY sound quality. Honestly i would buy something else. I threw mine in the trash and got a 12 dollar set that were really awesome, better than these(Philips SHN2500/37 Noise Canceling Earbuds).Do some research before you buy! - thanks for reading."
2,Noise Cancelling - Not so much . . .,"Thses are okay earbuds - they fit better than some and the sound quality is okay - not great, but acceptable. I mean, I knew these weren't the Bose $100 version. However, the ""noise cancelling"" seems to works by just increasing the volume of whatever you are listening to. If you want noise cancelled, I'd suggest popping for the over-the-ear ear-muff style headphones and be done with it. Don't think ""dork"" - think ""retro""."
2,Watch out for those gels!,"I received this headphone from my insurance company as a replacement for a stolen Sony noise cancelling headphone. While I like the string-like wires (it doesn't kink and tangle like regular headphone wires), the clunky control unit is not good if you're moving around (I'd rather have one that clips and stays put...this one swings around like a pendulum). But the worst problem of all is the gels easily come off the earbuds. You cannot replace them with the proper gels. I've tried using replacement Sony gels but they slip off all the time (usually stuck in your ear). Opt for another brand or wait until Phillips makes replacement gels available."
4,Ear Buds for DL,Nicely equipped with all typical plug types. Convenient volume control and good sound quality. Noise cancelling capability is still under review.
2,"Good sound, bad noise reduction.","Sound quality seemed very good with the noise-cancelling turned off, but the output level was lower than I expected, and bass was non-existent. When I turned the noise cancelling on, the volume level increased to what I expected but the noise cancelling didn't seem to work at all. I tried it near the refrigerator, in a car, and by the computer with its fan but it didn't seem to reduce any noise. Then I took it into a quieter room where the only sound was rumbling from distant traffic. In there, I noticed the headphones produced a sound similar to a stereo system when it's turned on loud with no music playing. So turning on the noise cancelling seemed to actually add noise. Back to the store."
3,"good earphones, bad noise canceling","these earphones fit me well, but that isn't gaurenteed for everyone. They are better than the ones i had previously, and have good bass and depth, but the ""noise-canceling"" is non-existant. It simply raises the volume with the help of a bulky box attached to the cord needing a AAA battery. Good earphones, but disappointing because of the false advertising.."
2,Not as good as I expected,"I just got this pair of headphone this morning and I can't wait to put on and try its noise cancelling function. However, things turn out out of my expectance though the treble is good. The bass is absolutely nothing, my ipods original earphone could work better than this. So if you are consider of getting a earphone which produce much bass, this isn't your choice. I can swear you will regret it. If you really want to buy an earphone which can 80-90% cancel the ambient sound, I would recommend Etymotic ER-6, that is ten times better than this though the price is somewhat expenssive."
1,Lose your earplugs? THROW AWAY THE UNIT!,"Not happy with sound reproduction. Cheap apple buds sound better. WORSE, when I told Philips, they told me to buy another unit? Screw you! I expected better"
1,Terrible earphones,"Got it as a gift. First off the amplifier actually generated noise, not cancelled it. Most of the time I used it without turning it on. Secondly, they lasted less than 7 months before the left earphone went out. I used these mainly when riding my motorcycle. They fit comfortably but that was all. I didn't expect much and was not disappointed. If you can find them for less than $5 they might be a good buy."
1,stay away,these were some of the worst headphones I have ever had. I don't even know how the sound quality is because it didn't even make it that far I tried for about an hour figuring out how to put these in my ear. They do not fit my ear at all and im not even sure if i'm going to get my money back. They kept falling out and i tried all 3 sizes several times to try and make it work. I expected alot more for philips. Who ever made this ear canal design i want to find and smack them for such a stupid useless design.
4,These headphones are great,"These headphones are great for a number of reasons. The small earpiece fits all size ears and they are very comfortable. They offer noise-canceling features with only ear-buds. For noise-calceling headphones with no straps, they do their job and do it well. I use them whenever i need to listen to music in noisy environments"
1,WARNING!!!,"I've used this headphones on and off for about 3 months.Last night, the rubber piece designed to go into the ear canal fell off while I was using the earbuds. The piece stayed in my ear canal and I was not able to take it out myself. I had to go to the emergency room and waste hours waiting for a doctor to remove it.Currently, I don't have any complications. It seems that my hearing is fine and the earbuds have not damaged my ear canal. The fact is that because of the product's malfunction I wasted my time and nerves.So, be very careful buying these."
1,don't waste your money,"This earbuds does not work well. It does not cancel the computer cooling fan noise and I doubt that it will cancel anything else.I have JVC HANC100, which works 10 times better, if not more. Not to mention the price is not much more. I understand that HANC100 is a lot bigger and won't fit under helmet, but it works very well. I bought the Philips HN060, because they are smaller, but it does not perform. Heck, if anyone wants to try it out, I will sell mine for half the Amazon list price.Yes, you will see the listing on ebay soon."
1,Horrible headphones,"One star is extremely generous. Do not waste your money. these headphones are terrible. They are bulky, with the noise reduction device moved to hang around your neck. The ear buds must be awkwardly and uncomfortably inserted to achieve noise reduction. And, the volume regulator remains too low. There are much better, much cheaper headphones from other manufacturers."
1,Do not cancel noise.,"I bought these on a whim before a trip to Europe, hoping to get a little piece and quiet on the plane. All those people who paid $200 or more for the Bose noise canceling headphones always looked happy, so I figured I would attempt happiness on the cheap.Wow, did I waste my money. These headphones DO NOT cancel plane noise. Turning the noise canceling on made no discernable difference. To make matters worse, there is no way to disconnect the earbuds from the noise canceling unit, so I cannot use these while I work out -- unless I want to wear a neck strap while I'm jogging. Run, don't walk, away from these."
2,BEWARE! Easy to losethe ear caps,"Great sound but disappointing that the end caps can come off and be lost without you noticing. I guess it depends on how much travelling and stuffing them in to a bag you do. Once you've worked your way through the different sizes of spare you have an unusable set of earbuds. ""...regrettably Philips do not at present supply the ear caps as a spare part.""."
2,Didn't stand up to the test of time . . . .,"Seems like a price too good to be true (not purchased at Amazon). Turns out it was.I had turn major problems,1) Ear buds eventually wouldn't stay on, they easy got lost/knocked off2) Battery compartment eventually needed a piece of cardboard to keep the battery in position, other wise would get a buzzing sound.In general, it could have been a great product.1) Noise cancelling work, not the best, but works2) Having a volume control is really really nice3) The ear buds where comfortable.In general I wouldn't recommend them unless you have to have a cheap pair of noise cancelling headphones. Then treat them with a lot of love and care . . ."
1,No customer support at all,"I purchased a pair of this a while back and subsequently one of the plastic tips fell off. When I called phillips, they said they didn't have replacement parts for it, and that I would have to offer a receipt in order to claim a whole new replacement set. I hate companies that make products without replacement parts, and I won't be buying anything more from them.The earbuds themselves featured a rather unwieldy design and a neglible volume control. There's no real way to wind up the cord without getting it tangled, and the sound quality was so-so.Addendum: I have since found out that you can order replacement parts from another site on the web, unafiliated with Phillips, or even on Amazon, if you look up double flange replacement tips."
1,Do not buy!,"I have owned a wide range of headphones, from cheap to pricey, and I am in the market to replace my last set of good headphones (Shure e3c). I bought the Audio-Technical ""EarSuit"" but found that the ear pressure just wasnt comfortable or compatible with sunglasses. So I bought a pair of these, and the best way to describe them is ""crap"".I wore them for a day and a half, and got so fed up with having to put them back in, their complete lack of noise cancelling, and the terrible sound quality that I couldnt try them out any longer.I will continue my search, and consider this a lesson learned, I hope you will to."
1,False advertsing...,"""Introductory concepts""? ""Elementary fashion""? ""...for the non-engineer""? ""Easy-to-understand introduction""? Who is this guy kidding? The entire book from start to finish is nothing but charts, equations, and graphics. This book is NOT an ""introductory"" book -- it's more for a 300-level Telecom college course. It's quite obvious that the author himself noted the previous review (below); he is simply trying to push this book as an ""easy-to-learn"" guide for Telecommunications. He's lying. There is ALOT of technical jargon in this book, and if you want to begin learning about Telecommunications this is not the book for it."
3,good fun movie,"This thing is a WEIRD movie. It has a bunch of wrestlers for Sonny to go up against. His partner is like the king of Judo and I have to say they could have did without him. Same actors as all of the movies. But this one is just better than the last 2 in the trilogy. The final fight is freaking awesome even with that same camera man who seems to be shaking it up and down. The best of the trilogy and some how the weirdest with these wrestling death matches.The picture quality is good btu does have horizontal lines that do distort the picture. Still pretty good picture quality though. Percectly widescreened, good sound, very good subtitles, and some really good liner notes just like the other 2 movies."
2,Overpriced,"This is nail polish remover, in a form factor for the foam gun.It doesn't really matter, after use of the cleaner and following all of the directions, the foam gun clogged up."
5,Clasic,"It is a great CD, brings the best Xmas atmosphere, simply love it. Recomends to everyone who likes clasic sound of Xmas songs."
5,An All 4 One Christmas,I love the harmony these guys sing and the variety of Christmas songs on their cd. I had the cassette tape for years and now have the cd. I listen to it even when it's not Christmastime.
3,Average,"It is kind of like Triva Persuit the Bible version. Despite what the box says about ""you just have to have an incling to win,"" that isn't exactly true. The reader has a card to read from, it will either be about a person, a book in the bible, or a thing. The player spins and whatever number they land on will determine the next phase. On certain numbers you can bid the card away (using chips) to another player so they can anser it, on other numbers everyone gets to guess the answer, stuff like that. Whoever reaches 50 (i think) chips wins. But at some point you will need to answer these questions, you don't have the options of bidding all of these cards away to another player. I mention that because these questions are hard to answer. Sometimes the card gives you scriptures to try and guess the answer, sometimes the name of the person's parents. Good Luck"
5,Great Trip Planner,"I'm planning a family camping/roadtrip to Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland. This book has been a real asset in the trip planning. I also recommend ""Off the Beaten Path, Virginia"" and ""Off the Beaten Path, Maryland & Delaware""."
3,National Geographic Guide to Scenic Highways and Byways: Second Edition (National Geographic Guide to Scenic Highways and Byways,"It is a nice book, but it is not comprehensive at all. ex. for Georgia there is only one. Actually most of the South East is sparsely represented. The information that is there is good and reliable, so from that point of view it is useful."
2,Not what it seemed,"My 5 year old daughter bought this with her birthday money. She played with it for an hour or so, before retiring it to her room. It just sits in the corner. The doghouse has a ramp that doesn't stay attached. She claims that the dog doesn't listen to her or do what she thought it should. The dog is very mechanical (I guess she was expecting a ""realistic"" dog). I would say, probably not worth the money. We would try to return it, but I already tossed the box."
2,Not what was expected,"I bought this for my 4 year old who LOVES dogs. Since she is allergic to the real ones, I thought this would be a good alternative. She saw it in the display at the store and ""loved it more than anything in her whole life"". She opened it on Christmas morning and after trying to get it to do as it did in the store for over half an hour, gave up and tossed it in the toy box. It did not come out of the house when called. It did not walk easily with the leash. It could not even figure out how to get back into it's house. I suggested we return it, but she loves the house it came in and uses it for her stuffed dog. The $40.00 dog that came with it, remains at the bottom of the toy box. Save your money, buy something that really does what it's supposed to!"
2,THE POUND PUPPY THAT DOESN'T WORK!,"This pound puppy doesn't work! I tried all the things to make it work but nothing happened! Everything I tried doesn't work on the puppy! He doesn't come out when I clap. He doesn't spin. He doesn't walk on a leash. We have to drag him. He doesn't find his way back to his house! It's terrible! I wish it could work! By Alexandra, age 7."
3,Family commitments,"Hopkins says in his biography that he can act very well Bill Hooper (a middle-aged bike boy) because he was this character, a divorced father (allowed only limited access to his little son)who takes revenge of women by the story of an other separated father. It's not my favorite movie, Hopkins is very good as usual, he is spectaculer, brilliant, terrific, a smouldering fury. But the story is not very thrilling. It's like a social case. I didn't like the heavy atmosphere, neither the long scenes on bike."
3,"Cheap Price, Cheap Product","For the price I guess I can't really complain. The order was filled quickly, as is always the case with Amazon. The quality of the product however, leaves a bit to be desired. The rubber scraper heads are quite thin and flimsy making them rather useless when scraping out anything with any body to it. For the moment they will do until I can order something a little more substantial."
2,Much like a high school research paper,"I was so excited to read this book, I found it at an amazing price, and it's about music! I got through the first 25 pages and had to walk away. I felt like a high school English teacher grading a research paper. The author comes off as trying too hard to sound like a REAL author and spitting out facts and things he heard throughout life. Blah blah blah....I would suggest finding a book that doesn't determine ""legends"" by the number of times the author has heard the story in a lifetime. This was not entertaining at all...now I know why it was sold for such a small price."
4,"don't hate me for my opinion, but...","i just received this book and was completely shocked that it was so full of satanic and occult references. had i known this i would not have purchased this book (and no i didn't get it through amazon, otherwise i would have known better than to buy it). i only skimmed through it-cover to cover and was so disgusted that i threw it out. for those that are into the extreme dark side of life or are interested in reading up on someone elses journey there then this book is for you. it was well written and informative, but unfortunately not for me. still i would give it 4 stars."
5,Creeps,"This Rough Guide to The Da Vinci Code is sound, articulate, well written, and altogether a brilliant investigation into the issues surrounding Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code. Anyone who is curious and wants to be informed, and wants to make use of the extensive further reading and website lists, will welcome this book. But a lot of creeps will not like it because it tells the truth."
2,"poorly written, inconsistent","For a book that is criticizing Dan Brown's accuracy, I found this book poorly written and containing many mistakes. Did they rush to publish this before editing? Mistakes such as claiming that the first crusades were ordered by Urban II in 1145, or claiming that ""symbology"" is not a real word. At other times sentences and phrases are so jumbled that you cannot understand the meaning after re-reading 3 or 4 times.I love Rough Guides, but this book was poorly edited and I expect better from this publisher."
5,a senior citizen speaks,"I'm a senior citizen. I like to read books before I give them to my grand daughter. I enjoyed ""When I was Built"" The illustrations are lovely and the story gives a good account of how things used to be. Ofcourse my grand daughter loved the book."
4,A breath of fresh air,"I rented and watched it last night. I loved it. The guys who gave it bad reviews do not have the slightest idea what difficulties the constraints of a limited budget pose. Finally a movie with a gay subject matter that can be enjoyed by regular audiences , not just a gay ghetto commercial for jaded queens. The locations were breath taking, let me ask; how many times to you get to see the Louisiana bayou in a gay movie? What we usually get is a New York, LA, SF yawner and the plethora of cruising venues (bigger yawn), here we see is something different for a change. How refreshing! (Not to mention suspenseful and touching). I thought it was better then most gay films I have seen and left you feeling entertained and enlightened not vacant. Kudos to you and your wonderful film Kyle Schickner."
1,Not Genuine! High Fructose Corn Syrup in this one (Heinz),"Not Genuine! High Fructose Corn Syrup in this one. You are buying a Heinz knock off. For the Genuine sauce you need the one still made in England called ""Original and Genuine."" See wikipedia for more info."
1,Disappointing ingredients,"While this kind does have high fructose corn syrup, Lea & Perrins offers an ""all natural"" variety which does not. That one has good ingredients and I recommend seeking that out instead of this one. I found it at the grocery store, but I don't see it on Amazon."
2,"NOT the ""Original"" - this has HFCS in it.","As other reviewers have noted, this version of Lea & Perrins' ""original"" Worcestershire sauce is far from the traditional recipe that's been used since 1838. As mentioned in the product description above, this product contains high fructose corn syrup. I hear Heinz has finally gone back to using sugar in the recipe this year (see the ingredients listing for the US version on the L&P; website), but unless and until this product information is updated, I'll assume what's being sold here is old inventory containing HFCS. If in doubt, stick with the bottles with orange labels if you can find them - that is the imported British Worcestershire sauce, and will most definitely be HFCS-free.Good on Heinz for listening to the opinions of their customers, though!"
1,Beware - high fructose corn syrup!,The above delightful reviews are sadly recalling a different product. The Lea & Perrins that is sold in the US now uses high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar (which is what is still in the UK version.) This may not matter to some but it definitely detracts from the authentic clean spicy taste by making it more sickly sweet which the original is not. It really becomes apparent in Bloody Mary's and also in scrambled eggs or toasted cheese (Welsh Rarebit.) Bring a bottle back from the UK and compare the difference. A pity because it must mean only a cent or so difference in the manufacturing cost.
1,They've RUINED IT!!!,"I've been buying and enjoying L&P Worcestershire Sauce for 30+ years. Now they've changed the recipe, it doesn't look or taste anything like the old product. Store brands are better now. What a shame!"
2,The original is available,"I've always avoided the Lea&Perrins brand due to using hfcs but today I was in the store and I was happy to find Lea&Perrins ""all natural"" it uses sugar instead. Seek it out if you want the true original."
1,"HFCS is gone, Replaced with GMO beet sugar? Not original recipe.","I stopped buying this because of it containing high fructose corn syrup. They replaced it last year with sugar. Most of the time if it says ""sugar"" without saying ""cane sugar"" it likely came from sugar beets which are almost always genetically engineered. I'm sticking with an organic brand from now on.The original recipe calls for malt vinegar. The American recipe uses regular white vinegar. The bottles sold in the UK still use the original recipe."
3,SIMPATICO RECUERDO DE UNA ESTADIA EN LAS NUBES,"conjunto desprolijo de canciones que parecen haberse desprendido de una subita sacudida de cabeza de uno de los ""locos"" mas simpaticos de la voragine psicodelica..caido de un ascensor desde el decimotercer piso, intentando agarrarse en cada saliente, ERICKSON nos ofrece un puñado de temas asombrosamente melodicos y agradables, escondidos tras un sonido mediocre y ""de entrecasa"" que desdibuja un poco la apreciacion final."
2,Get Coloring Mandalas 2 instead,"As I received both Coloring Mandalas Volume 1 and Volume 2 as gifts to help me during recovery post surgery, Coloring Mandalas 2 is a MUCH better book than this volume. The mandalas in volume 1 (this one) are not as complex or meaningful as the ones I prefer in volume 2. The mandalas in volume 1 are much more simplistic in design and suited toward the younger coloring book crowd - even the ages 4-8 category - than those in the other book. So as an adult, this is not the coloring mandala book for you unless you prefer less detail."
2,Not as relaxing as most.,"After coloring hundreds of mandalas I found this book to be less calming or relaxing. I'm not a fan of mandalas that contain eyes, angles, demons, etc. within the designs, so this was not my favorte mandala coloring book. It makes me hesitate to purchase Ms. Fincher's other mandala coloring books."
2,"mandalas, not all are created equally","The volume 2 from this author was exceptional so I purchased volume 1 expecting the same. I was sadly disappointed by the material in this one, not nearly as 'spiritual' as the 2nd, plus was filled with people like drawings that I wasnt fond of. I'm debating on trying Volume 3 now, will it be more like 2 or like 1??"
4,Beautiful book,"I was looking for a book of Mandalas to not only color but then hang up near my meditation area to look at. For the most part this book is perfect and I've colored two Mandala's so far. For me though, at least 50% of the so called Mandalas are really pictures of people, trees, etc, and not the typical meditation kaleidoscope repetition I would use for meditating. However I'm please and will try other books like this."
3,I Was Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book. The mandalas are way too basic, and not very relaxing. They're also not as ""spiritual"" as some I have colored. The lines are harsh and angular. Also, the author didn't provide enough information on mandalas - she just covered the rudimentary basics. I guess I was expecting more, but it's my own fault for ignoring the other Amazon reviewers' comments."
5,Awesome Book to Color,I have the other two books to this and I love all three of them and the fact that there is no pattern on the back side of each picture is absolutely wonderful because that is where I take time to write where I am at with my emotions before I start and during and then after it is all deone. Helps me stay grounded and in the moment
2,disappointed,The good news about this book is that it has a spiral binding which makes coloring very easy. The bad news is that I didn't care for the designs. I was hoping for something much more intricate and while there are several pretty ones most of them aren't to my taste. I purchased two books and was much happier with the designs in World Mandelas although it doesn't have a spiral binding.
3,Hardly Essential but...,"Basically, this is a fine compillation from Ray's early years; at some tracks he even sounds quite close to Nat King Cole (his early idol, from the period before he actually found his magnificent voice).This is still fine popular music, although a notch bellow Ray's tops and, since the title is misleading, there goes one star..."
4,Wagner's Bird Seed 20lb,"Well for about the first week and a half after putting this food out the birds weren't really digging in. They went from swarming the feeder and finishing it in around a day, to picking at it. I was worried that there was something wrong with the food, but I guess they just needed to get used to a little bit different of a mix. Now they eat this stuff like there won't be any tomorrow, and if I don't fill the feeder up there won't be, haha. The majority of the birds that eat this are lots of common sparrows, but I've seen a cardinal come around too."
3,Birds loved it... my wallet didn't,"I have used this bird seed many times... it attracts cardinals, blue jays, and other beautiful birds... (Squirrels like this product, too!) it contains a lot of sunflower seeds, so you can expect to find their black casings on the ground, which is messy. I can usually find this at Home Depot for a cheaper price."
1,IT IS MOSTLY ALL MILLET,upon opening this bag to transfer to a container I find that it is 98% millet!!! I am very dissatified with product and will not recomend!
1,"Full of bugs, Full of bugs, Full of bugs!","Watch out! I purchased this bag of bird food which ultimately has all the bird food birds DO NOT LIKE! My birds continually would dump the seed out of the bird feeder trying to find the very few sunflower seeds in the mix. Even worse, after the second or third time of having to refill what was dumped on the ground, I started seeing lot of bugs within the bird food. Black bugs with a very funny head. Almost look like ticks! I forgot to mention... had to throw the whole, bag away as I didn't want some type of infestation in my other foods."
2,It made my birds sad,I guess you really do get what you pay for. There are hardly any sunflower seeds in this mix. My birds are sad.
1,save the trees,"this book is a complete disaster. As its mysterious title indicates, the book is very vague and does not explain any of the proposed matters. It seems like the author gathers information from here and there and throws it at you in an attempt to make up the chapters. To make the matters worse, the quality of the print and paper is almost as bad as the author's work. Although this book would make a great door stop, it's still a waste of a good tree. PLease save the trees and your money and don't buy this book."
4,Great Review/Reference,"""Electrical Energy Systems"" provides easy to understand descriptions and sample problems for the reader. An excellent reference for anyone involved in the Electrical Power Industry."
5,Brings the levels to life,This parable brought to life some of the meditation techniques that I have studied and read about. The story is so sweet. I was read the first three chapters by a very dear friend as a bedtime story. I just had to have more to see what would happen to the main character and to keep the memory of the bedtime stories alive. I will read this many times and enjoy new aspects of it each time. It is very insightful and is delightful to read. The author is truely gifted.
4,What's the score?,"A fantastic single from Sleater-Kinney. ""Get Up"" is one of the sexiest songs (really, just pay attention to the lyrics!) and ""By the Time You're Twenty-Five"" is an irresistable slab of, and I hate this term, pop-punk.However, the true gem of the single (and one of my five favourite Sleater-Kinney songs) is ""Tapping"". The opening guitar part is fantastic and it's a little different from the typical Sleater-Kinney track. Sort of epic... at least for the Kinney."
5,3 of their best,"""Get Up"" and ""By the time yr 25"" are such good riot girl pop. Both b sides are great, better than a lot of the songs that made it onto the Hot Rock (which was fairly disappointing after hearing this EP)."
2,Fragrance Way Too Strong,"I thought for my newborn son the smell (lavender) was really strong, as I have found with all the Mustela products I registered for and received. I won't use it any more on him because the smell of his skin (which I really love) is totally over powered by their added fragrance. I'll use it for myself though. If I had paid for these products myself I would feel ripped off, just because they are some of the most expensive doesn't make them the best choice. I recommend using something more mild, I switched to Johnson's Head to Toe Baby Wash (and no, I'm not getting any money to state this, sadly). If you are really interested in Mustela then get a sample first and try it out. Also, for cradle cap, which my son has gotten twice now, I just rub some olive oil into his scalp, wash off the oil, and scrape off the, uh, shall we say grossness with a really soft tooth brush. I do this outside because it can get messy, and yes, gross but do-able."
3,"A decent option, for newborn shampoo","We originally bought Mustela Foam Shampoo for Newborns, because we had read numerous reviews about it's ability to fight off cradle cap. Unfortunately for us, our little one must have such a stubborn case, even regular and continuous use of this product didn't even seem to phase it. But, that aside, if you're looking for a quality shampoo for other reasons, it's a solid choice. It has a light fragrance and as a foam, stays in place on the babies head and doesn't drip into their eyes. Just make sure you buy this product from a quality seller on Amazon or elsewhere. The first bottle we received was delivered unsealed, without a cap, and with a sticky bottle, and there was no way I was using it on my newborn in that condition."
5,"2 Kids, got rid of cradle cap","I have 2 boys, 2 years apart. Both developed cradle cap, and this product took care of it both times. I had friends telling me to use olive oil on the scalp, to scrub their baby heads, and suggesting all sorts of other remedies. I was very pleased to find this product and have put it on my ""list of things to be sure and tell my friends about"" for their babies. Good luck!"
5,Worked great even on the first try,"My baby's cradle cap was REALLY bad. She looked like a lizard head (poor thing) I saw the reviews for this, and bought it right away. It honestly worked the very first time I used it. It didn't magically disappear, but it was VERY noticeably better. Within a week it was pretty much completely gone. I also bought a special brush which i used on her while it was in her hair, so I don't know if that helped it work faster..... Either way worked great!"
2,"Smells great, but didn't help with her cradle cap","This shampoo smells great, but did very little for my daughter's cradle cap. I found the old fashioned baby oil and a good shampoo afterward really made the greatest difference along with gentle messaging her scalp with a brush several times though out the day. My friends also told me dandruff shampoo works well too, but be careful not to get the suds in baby's eyes. Regardless, I say save your $$$ and try another solution."
5,works wonders,This shampoo is a must have!!!! My baby is one month and I used this shampoo for his moderate cradle cap. After just one use I saw the difference.
5,cradle cap gone in a few days,"i bought this along with the Bean B Clean baby scalp brush. My sons cradle cap was gone in a few days. While the shampoo doesn't smell just 100% wonderful, i didn't care. The point of the product is to help with cradle cap and that it what it did. Great product."
4,Better than regular shampoo,I got this for my one year old twins. Their scalp was a little flaky and wasn't sure if it was cradle cap or not. After a several uses it cleared it up on one of my sons head. My other sons head this differently helped but didn't clear it up all the way.
2,OK,"I have just finished reading ""Rave America, New School DanceScapes"" and I must say that Mireille Silcott has done a great job regurgitating the same rave history lesson that is given in most ""rave"" books. Her ability to capture the essence of Rave is pretty good and her style of writing is also good. Yet, I felt as though I was rereading books by Simon Reynolds or Dan Sicko. Check out ""Rave Culture, An Insiders Overview"" for something new and different!"
3,Terrify No More,"This is an incredibly gripping true story of the child molestation/prostitution rings in various countries throughout the world but primarly on a notorious one in Southeast Asia. It is a must read for any individual with a heart for the suffering, especially children. It is a hard read in the sense that the authors go into details of how these children are being exploited but again this is a reality in the world today. Also heart pounding when the authors tell of the raid which is the primary focus of the book and the work of IJM."
1,Disappointment,This book is a great disappointment. Buying this book I thought to obtain some serious information on the subject. I didn't expect to buy some superficial nonsence of a local U.S. sect. To European standards Gary Haugen's prostelitizing is appalling obscene and self serving and in this IJM is to be considered a dangerous sect. Don't buy this book.
5,"Painful, powerful book -- may change your life","Sometimes enlightenment comes like a cold slap in the face. That's what this book delivers -- stories of abuse and oppression that most people don't know exist in our world today. I didn't. But Haugen and Hunter, in a style that is smooth and suspenseful, tell the stories of numerous victims of slavery and oppression who were helped through brave undercover operations by true-life heroes. At times heart-breaking and painful, at others joyful and celebretory, this book is hard to put down. You won't want to, but you will want to give copies to your friends. Nicely done. Thanks for helping me to understand the world just a little bit better outside my own whitewashed life."
3,"Well written and good plot, but just not my style","I don't normally read romances. This is a short book and a very fast read. A widower takes a job as principal of a school in a small southern town and falls in love with the Special Ed. teacher. She has family problems of her own in an alcoholic half sister and together they find each other. Not bad, but definitely not my usual style."
5,The Hurricane starring Jon Hall 1937,"(...)I watched on it on my portable 7"" DVD player and cannot wait to rerun it on the larger TV. It was in one word spectacular. The special effects of 1937 made the hurricane scenes come alive. You don't need the computer generated effects of a movie such as the new STAR WARS to hold your interest. Sure its Black and White but that makes it even better. Bravo John Ford, Bravo Jon Hall, and Bravo to Amazon.com for making this classic 1937 film available. Five Stars plus from Connecticut."
3,Just one complaint.,"This is a great old movie. The single most important reason I bought it was to see Lamour sing Moon of Manakoora. But the song has been cut out, so if that's important to you it will be disappointing. With the song in it I'd give it four stars."
2,Disappointing!,"I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed with this album. Several places ""Triangle"" has been referred to as a classic album and as the best album by the band. It does feature several fine strings-arrangements by Van Dyke Park, but the overall lack of real good songs, makes the album a pretty dull experience.Actually the first song that really stirred my attention was Randy Newman's ""My Old Kentucky Home"" and by the end of that song, the album was over. A few more songs like ""Magic Hollow"" and and the title track lift themselves above average, but not enough to make the album really interesting."
2,Naaah!,"Much over rated,apart from the lovely 'magic hollow' - and very short. Buy the 'best of' instead!"
4,the fall is pretty good,"Okay so I don't own the album yet. But I have see the birds live a few times in Chicago. They are a great band, and you should give them a try, they have a new album out that's really great, ""Come to the city"" is easily my favorite song, written by tim, my sister's boyfreind actualy? Hmm, coincidence, nah.But it's called String of bee's, actually you'll even see my sister amy on the cover or in the jacket. She's good too."
2,the only one I need is missing in the kit,"I order the kit just for the white plastic tool (showed in the picture, which is used for loosing the cartridge). The funny thing is this one is not included in the kit. So I return it."
3,A bit of MTV trivia,"VH1 Classic recently re-broadcast all of the videos from the first 12 hours of MTV (in order plus a little bit of the original VJ commentary) in August 1981. Everybody knows that Video Killed The Radio Star by The Buggles was the first video ever on MTV but did you know that When Things Go Wrong by Robin Lane and The Chartbusters was shown in the first hour? And I Don't Want To Know was also shown that day?Seeing the When Things Go Wrong video of RL and the CB's running around on a boat was a great deja vu moment for me. Great song by a band that coulda, shoulda been contenders."
4,"Heavy, yes, but differently so","These guys are like the missing link between Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age. They are heavy, but they are also quirky and original. They have less production and are less thick than Kyuss or QOTSA, and less emphasis on tuneful vocals. But don't let that stop you. FJ never forget the groove, and as you listen to this CD more and more, you start hearing how the hooks emerge in fresh new says. Good stuff, worth your time."
4,Ask a rocket scientist,"I think ""Publishers Weekly"" needs to talk to an actual rocket scientist before they declare this technology a ""dream."" We've had many successful tests of this system, even recently in October of 2007. Such partisan ""reviewers"" should check the facts rather than look so ignorant. This book does a good job of laying out the groundwork for the background of the need for a defensive system against ICBMs, the technical challenges of ""hitting a bullet with a bullet"" and such.Some day we may look back on this as the best thing our technology did to protect millions of American citizens from a nuclear holocaust, despite those who tried to dismiss this as a ""dream"" or impossible. The technical successes of the test program have already proven them wrong."
5,Can you believe a bluetick hound?,"Sheriff Zachary McCoy's bluetick hound bounded forwardsniffing the air and raced down the line of the bucketbrigade. Birdie jumped up, placing her paws on the woman'sshoulders and let out a howl. The sound was pure joymade by the hound dog. Birdie did not know, that shecould have blown the cover of this undercover agent,sent into the compound to find out what this cult wasplanning....a possible up coming act of terror. Evensheriff McCoy remembered Teagan and wondered why shewas there. He did not want to give her away butknew she did not belong in this situation.Through laughter to fear this book carries you alongto an exciting ending. Much of human characters areshown here to add to a marvelous and intrigueing read.I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did. I hope tosee more written by this author."
5,Graffiti Rock Rating,"I think it is a must have, if you were from that era, or if you just a Hip-hip head at heart. It brought back memories as when i was a kid. The Extra features was a nice touch, you see Doug E. Fresh, Dj red alert, Afrika Bambata, RSC doing their thing."
2,Old School 4ever,"Graffiti Rock! wasnt there 2 episodes? anyways,while the show itself is classic,they couldve included some BETTER special features!i think they could've represented a lot better on this disc,whut about classic b-boy videos,or battles.Some of the stuff on there is just plain corny!i remember seeing the Nyc breakers perform in front of President Reagan...Twice!! Hello??,only 2 stars, maybe 2 and a half,could've gotten more......."
5,Works Great!!,I got a price quote for this at U-Haul and they quoted me double what I paid here. It fit and works perfect. No complaints here.
3,The ghouls are coming,There are no real scares in the movie.It started out slow then picked up towards the end of the movie.Good for kids and teens alike.
3,pretty good,THis movie is about a girl who finds out that the town she moved to is cursed with goblins that come out of their graves every halloween.
4,Good,"Good fun Halloween movie takes place in a town where nobody celebrates Halloween, or even says the word Halloween because of a past tragety. The movie is about about a boys grandpa who dies after having a ""Halloween"" (getting hit on the head by a pumpkin) and comes back, as a good guy."
4,A must for Halloween,Our family enjoys Halloween and this is a must see for our Halloween party. Our grandchildren are at the age to pass this tradition on to.
4,Zombies keep coming out of the ground. YIKES!!!!!!!!!!!!,Curtis Danko made a statue so scary that it can burn somone's eyes out! So nobody dares to look underneath it.
4,You've found THE sound !,"A fine CD by a fine band. I own several of their earlier releases and have had the pleasure of seeing them live. Their combination of instrumental and vocal material is excellent. I am not a surf fanatic but these guys got it ! R n R played right. FYI - some of my other faves are:MC5, Damned, Link Wray, Mudhoney, Jerry Lee Lewis"
1,(...),"While this book talked about, and delt with reaserch regarding a very serious topic, the reserch was done very atrociously. For some one that is a so called jourelist, she did not only not dig deeper to find the facts, but told bold face lies about individuals. If the book was to be a work of fiction, and called as such, than it should not include real people with in the story. There are many people with in this book who could not only have there lifes ruined by lies(or mis-interpritation, telling what Mrs. Burkett wanted to tell, not what was the truth)but who could also sue the author for libel, slander, and nemerous other ""crimes"". I would only hope that on the aftermath none of the individuals written with in the book, nor the writer, were to have to suffer any negative consiquenses as a result of horrible journalism. It would be best if the rest of the world, including those written in the book, would just ignore it and forget about it."
2,title,"The book was shably written. It was full of run on as well as incomplete sentences. The subject jumped around to much making the reader lose what the setting or topic was. It was full of not only misinterpritations, but details and quotes that were falsified. While few parts were true and most of the topics were topics that most people with in any comunity do not wish to accept nor discuss, over all it was shabely reserched. Due to poor writting ability it made for rough reading."
1,Save your money,"This was a very poorly written book. The author jumps around so much you totally lose where she is going with her ideas.The book also is slanted in such a way that all the educators are portrayed as complete idiots and as people who do not love their jobs or the young adults they teach. I fail to believe anyone would dedicate their lives to teaching if they did not truely care about the futures of those they are educating.Save your money and just go back and re-read Lord of the Flies, the main story is about the same."
1,Another Planet: A poor account of high school,"I was a senior at Prior Lake High School when Eli Burkett was there to research for her book. I feel that our school and community was cheated by the guest we allowed into our school. By no means is this an accurate account of an American highschool. She talked with the so called ""rebels"" of the school and did not include anything from your average mainstream student. The book is full of one sided views that do not properly represent our high school. Save your money, because this book is not worth it."
5,the definitive resource,"This is almost the last word on Rabbit diesels if you have to know how to fix just about anything on the car no other book even comes close to being as thorough as this one, I have just about worn out my copy, but that's after ten years and at least as many Rabbit diesels."
3,knives,Picture was deceiving...didn't want serated knives but all of them were except the one they showed in picture. Thought they were all serated
3,Ginsu knives,"The knives are attractive and sharp with a substantial feeling in terms of weight. We have noticed a couple of spots on one of them that look like rust. It won't wash off or wipe off. It doesn't affect the utility of the knife...more cosmetic. We will be watching as time goes on to see if other spots appear or these get worse. Thus our ""they're OK"" rating for the time being."
4,gc controller starter kit,"I will not buy from ebay anymore, you could have pay much more for it at ebay. and the service of follow up from amazon is unbelievable, quality and service is the best in internet purchase. very happy with the gc kit.thank you amazon! be sure to deal with reputable production."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought the Lapinator as a gift for both my mom and my dad. They both use their laptops while they watch TV all the time, so I thought it would be a great gift idea. When I opened the box, I was very dissapointed at the product I was looking at. It is pretty much a piece of cardboard sitting on top of some foam padding. I would have been better off taking an old pillow and gluing a piece of an old box to the top of it.The picture makes it look slick, but it's lame. I returned both of them immediately."
2,Not worth the money,"This was the first lap desk I had purchased and I was initially happy with it because it kept the heat off my lap. However, shortly after I realized that the stick on bumpers aren't high enough to allow adequate air flow to circulate and keep my computer cool. My computer became so hot the glue on the bumpers melted and they started shifting. My computer would still overheat and shut down. I threw the lapinator in the trash. I consider it a waste of money."
3,blocks heat well; comfortable -- but could be better,"I've had my lapinator for about a year. It is comfortable on my lap, and keeps the heat away from my legs. However, the airflow between the lapinator and my laptop is negligible, and the laptop still gets very hot, which can cause electronics problems. Plus, most of the heat my laptop generates is toward the bottom of the keyword, where there is even less airflow. Also, the angle of the keyboard would be more comfortable if it was higher -- and this would also put the screen at a better height for viewing.I think the lapinator could be improved by moving the small rubber ""feet"" to the bottom edge, and providing much larger rubber feet to go at the top -- 2 to 3 times the height of the small ones."
2,Overpriced and uncomfortable,I would not recommend this lapdesk if it's comfort and convenience you're looking for. The attachable mouse-pad is a nuisance and the mouse tends to slide off. The bottom of the lapdesk is bulky and lays uncomfortably on your lap. For what you get I feel it's overpriced and not very convenient.
3,Espionage,"I have enjoyed reading quite a few book by Eric vanLustbader, but ""Black heart"" was a bit too long to maintain good flow of the plot. There was also a tendency to delve too far into mysticism for the story to be fully plausible. The reference to historic events and the far east is quite unsurpassed."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This book is about a warrior who is now a political operator. When the guy he is in charge of gets killed, he gets dragged back into using his more overt violence oriented skills.At the heart of the conflict is Asian racism, nationalism and xenophobia, as two antagonists from different countries do not like each other at all. He gets caught in the middle.Martial arts moves galore, too."
3,Good Page Turner But...,"Just read this book recently having gotten a used copy.The book is overly long. It could be at least 100 pages less in size, and, while the author's knowledge of the specific names of karate and judo moves (etc.)is impressive, it grows a little weary during a fight scene to have each punch and counter-punch described with a text-book name. Also, some of the sex scenes while short in length, are a little too graphic (unnecessarily so). This will offend some.Still, an interesting read."
4,just what I needed,my mother fell recently and had to stay in bed I got this because even with a monitor I couldn't hear her so she can ring it to get someone to help when needed
2,Does not fulfill...,It did not fulfill my expectations.Not a lot information about USING your camera...Fair buy.Luiz
3,Memory,"A collection of mnemonic tricks to recall a wide variety of stuff. Too scatter shot to be considered much more than entertainment. Although one could say it teaches by example, leaving the readers to create their own ways of remembering things.Mostly uses acronyms, alliteration, sing-song sayings, and the like.A bathroom book if there ever was one."
3,not too bad,"These are heavy duty and look alot better than an outside the window mounted visor, it did take a few days for them to seat properly in my window without it getting caught in my window, you may need some more double sided adhesive tape to prevent this from happening on the backside of the visor."
3,"Only ""so-so""","This is an awful ablum. I bought it because it had ""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"" on it, a master piece song. I was also happy to find one other song that I liked very much on it. I only recommend getting this cd if you have a plan for the music. It is not a good cd just to listen to."
4,If you want a BIG lunch box THIS IS THE RIGHT ONE,"This lunch box is what I expected PLUS MORE. It is a bit larger than the usual lunch bag or box. It can hold your soft drinks in an upright position and there is room for several, plus your lunch. If you want a lunch box for two, this one is perfect. It has enough compartments to store your utencils, napkins and even a placemat.Even though this bag is larger than most, it is nice to have the extra room for those sometimes larger containers.I got this bag for my Husbands lunches and it works out great. I can even include a midday snack without 'smashing' other parts of the meal.Delivery time was perfect and the product is first class."
2,Not exactly what I had in mind,"I needed a lunch bag to take to work. I knew it said large however it was gigantic. I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but when I go on a picnic I'll be using it then I guess. Quality is average, not too flemsy but not the best either. Hope this helps."
3,Chinese Made,"Problem with this item is that although the outside in nylon, the inside liner is plastic and less than a mil thick. The liner breaks way beforethe outer layer. Basically, it sucks."
3,Bigger than I thought,"My own fault, didn't look at the dimensions close enough. This is way too big for a one person lunch bag in my opinion. Good for a picnic or family travel lunch bag. Well made though so it will be useful."
2,way too big,I thought i was getting a cooler bag that would be good for a lunch bag for my husband whom takes big lunches but the bag was way to big.I had a hard time determining from the details how big the bag actually was and tried to pick the smallest one. He could pack 10 lunches in this bag. Would definently be great for picnics or summer outdoor events.
3,just too big,"I had bought this to take my lunch to work, but after an incident where it almost ate me for lunch, I decided to give it to someone who was able to tame it. It's just too big for me."
3,Cooler Bag,"I was looking for a cooler bag with stronger sideing, but that was my fault.... should have read the description better.I do not think that it kept my water cold for an extended period of time, even with a Rubermaid Ice pack in itOn the positive side, it can carry a lot of food or beverages for its size."
5,Holds A Lot.,"We got this to transport groceries in hot weather, which it does well. What was a surprise however was just how much it holds - including several pounds of meat, OJ, bacon, yogurt, and there's still room to spare. If you need to transport a lot and keep it cold, this bag is what you want."
1,Not a good value for the money,The cooler was very flimsy and cheap quality. It was slightly larger than what was advertised and not a good value for what you pay.
1,Not what I expected,"I thought this bag was going to be just what I needed. After checking everything, I was a little disappointed. The strap was too short for me (I'm 6'2"") and the top unzips or opens not as shown but across the strap. I just gave it away because it would not work for me."
4,Great,"The bags are great quality for the price they are purchased at. They are very spacious and should hold a lot. I am unsure about the quality of the insulation, but we have not used the cooler yet."
2,Poor Product,"Zipper catches often, and generally does not operate smoothly.More importantly, this bag does not keep contents cool/cold. Bag was used to hold lunch/snacks while at work. After a few hours (2-3) contents were noticeably warmer. Used two solid, plastic cold packs in addition to food."
2,Won't recommend,"Now that I understand that Haruf wrote Where You Once Belonged nine years before Plainsong, I feel less angry with him. I won't belabor the point--read the other 2-star reviews--they nailed it."
3,Glad I didn't read this first,"Having read all of his other works first, I suppose there was no way around being disappointed in this one.The thing I like most about Mr. Haruf's writing is that he makes me care about the characters. He never seemed to know where he was going with this story, though, and the ending is a huge let down. Though I enjoyed reading it, he punted the ending."
2,Not Good,"I am a big fan of Kent Haruf. Loved Plainsong especially. Am addicted to reading all of his books - HOWEVER - really thought this book was weak. Unrealistic in my mind, too. Just no backbone to this book. Still love Kent Haruf, but this book just didn't make it in my humble estimation."
2,Not the Kent Haruf I remember.,Seemed dull and not as interestin as his previous novels.I was expecting better.Im sorry but I dont have the seven additional words you require for this review.What happened to brevity.
4,"Very well written book, enjoyable to read","I read this book today while waiting 3+ hrs for Jury duty. It helped the time pass quickly. I enjoyed the pacing of the book and felt for the characters as they lead their lives in a small Colorado town. I enjoyed the book so much, I passed it own to one of my fellow jurors. This is a quick read."
2,Left wanting,"I was eager to try this book after an enjoyable experience reading ""They Tie that Binds"" by the same author. I enjoy the sparse writing style of this author and feel that his ability to bring life to the characters and their settings in such few words is very effective. I enjoyed this tale of a local boy gone bad until the last few pages. It had an adrupt and disappointing ending lacking originality and creativity. I am glad this book was short so I don't feel my time was completely wasted."
1,"Misleading, blasphemous and boring","A reader scanning the back cover of this novel would be led toexpect a historical romance. It is not a romance, nor is it purely ahistorical novel. It reads like someone's rejected master's thesis dressed up to look like romance. The author manages to offend nearly every religion, slandering catholics and protestants and muslims alike. Usually I resell my books when I've finished with them, but this one went straight into the trash can. If Ms. Kyle wants to write some New Age exploration of spirituality, she should make her subject clear from the beginning. This is a truly awful assault on all religions. END"
4,"Give me deathpunk, baby.","A bit less streamlined punk rock, and a bit more on the arena rock side, but the songwriting and tongue-in-cheek (and not the cheek in your face, mind you) humor makes ""Apocalypse Dudes"" ten times more interesting than the Black Murder Halo City Catheters or other bands of the ilk. The winner here is ""Get It On,"" with it's blatant-Ramomes-rip-off hook."
3,Turborock,"Need a companion for your Nashville pussy, Hellacopters or other Backyard babies albums?Turbonegro mixes classic rock with punk and hard rock, very classic but plaisant and fun!A touch of early Alice Cooper, in the look but also in the music and a touch of glam.Apocalypse dudes rocks from A to Z but doesn't shine with novelty, also I found the Lead vocals sometimes a lil weak.Anyway good rockin' album and excellent ""garage"" type production.I hope you don't mind the word motherf+++er which is probably said and yelled more than a hundred times on this cd.3 and 1/2 stars would be more fair."
5,Very thorough,"Provides a nice summary of phonetics of Spanish American dialects. Very useful for anyone studying Spanish pronunciation, dialects or language."
5,Great gift,"My son-in-law had received a barbecue for his birthday. He told my daughter he would never wear an apron. He's a big Cowboys fan, so when I saw this apron I had to get it. Well, the ""I'd never wear an apron"" guy, loves his Cowboys one. The quality is great and he's enjoying it often."
1,Where not to order Bens repellant,"The picture on the website showed Bens 100, which was what I wanted - so I ordered it. What arrived was Bens 30 - clearly and obviously not what was advertised. Although Cosmetic Solutions refunded, I have had to pay the return mail costs. As far as I can see, they have not changed the page on the site as yet.Would never use them again"
5,worked excellent,"Traveled to rain forest in Belize and the product worked excellent. It has a strong smell but that will dissipate as it dries and its way better than getting bit. Be careful not to spill or spray on certain surfaces, the stuff is strong and can cause damage. Its not just this product but any of them with a high level of deet in it."
4,good -but smelly - product,"it has a high level of DEET, which is good if you're going to places like Africa or S. America. but, it smells fairly strong - it's not something you'd want to wear on a date!"
5,Very good plant-allergy book,Mary Jelks MD has made an important contibution to the literature of allergy with this book. It is especially good for people in the Florida area. I am the author of Allergy-Free Gardening.
4,SOUL STEPPIN Step Show,"Appreciated the quality documentary on this special subject. Look forward to seeing other work by these producers.Very much disappointed by the adjudication that took place in this competition: the vote was definitely stacked the WRONG way -- all the way. Just so you know, the Houston Sigma's HAD IT TOGETHER -- great comraderie, esprit de corps, the look was commendable and professional. Get the project just to see them."
1,worse buy ever,"Literally worked for less than 10 seconds. I opened the box put in new batteries, and turned it on. It ran for a few seconds and broke. I tried removing the batteries, and turning it off and on, and it didn't fix it. DO NOT BUY, this is a really poorly made product."
3,Does the job...,"This product does the job, though not as I really had hoped. The bit is a little larger than I'd expected and requires more pressure to keep the bit from skipping on glass. It is also a bit bulkier for small hands and does overheat. Otherwise it works fine. Its not good for long or detailed job as it overheats... but I have 2 and change between the two of them as they begin to overheat. Its good for the price, and even better for small occasional jobs. But if you're looking to etch the next picasso... you might want to upgrade to something more durable and versitile."
1,"Not a regular model, don't know how to use and it's not easy to use, high shipping cost","It's not a regular type of Fine Tuner. Even the violin teacher doesn't know how to use it and it's not easy to use.Also the vendor charged too much for the shipping fee. For $3.75 fine tuner, it charged for $3.75 for this very small tuner, double the price and not provide return shipping free. Not worth the price."
5,Surprisingly Wonderful!,"Fearing another Christmas Journey mess and hoping for a book along the lines of Christmas Visitor, I had no idea what I'd find in A Christmas Guest. What I found was a great story excellently written.To be honest, I could not imagine Grandmother as a sympathetic character. I do not want to give away much of the surprise for anyone who hasn't read this, but we see another side of the cranky old lady and we come to understand her better.After seeing her in a different light, I'm curious as to how Perry portrays her in the upcoming Pitt novels. I hope she will allow Grandmother's character to grow- it would be a waste of great character if she doesn't.A Christmas Guest is one of Perry's best efforts. There's a seemingly unsolvable mystery, a full cast of suspects, humor, a moral, and a great feeling of satisfaction after you've turned the last page.A lovely book."
4,Nice Bedtime Read,"This is my first Anne Perry novel. It is the story of a crochety old grandmother in Victorian times who is sent to stay with family for Christmas in the windswept Romney Marshes of England. There she meets a life-changing guest, solves a mystery, and comes to a new understanding of people and acceptance of herself. The mystery is more of an intrigue as there is not much suspense or puzzle-solving--it all seems to be resolved in a pat and sometimes not fully explained manner--but Ms. Perry is obviously a gifted story-teller and has you turning the pages. I would definitely pick up another of her books."
3,sophisticted and genteel,"This book was chosen by our ""Book Club"" at the suggestions of one of our members who had already rad the story.It was light and entertaining....the characters sophisticated, proper and wealthy....all with secrets. A nice read for our December meeting."
3,Christmas Guest,Light reading mystery. I did enjoy the development of Mariah Ellison (grandmama) and Maude. There were secrets to be discovered and a love story to be learned. Relationships with friends and families always have some intrigue. What we learn from others about ourselves can be ?????. Enjoy.
5,Christmas hope,"If you enjoy Anne Perry, you will love this little novella forChristmas as I did. It is about hope and change. I think weall want to see redemption and this little book delivers."
4,Buck Alpha Hunter,"Its a well made knife but has room for improvement. The finishing could be better. Its not quite mirrow finish and not quite stain finish as well. It has a blurry mirror effect, not very pleasing. A complete stain finish would be much better. Also the sheath gets cut easily when drawing the knife. It is a design flaw. Despite the corns it is super sharp out of the box and feels great in hand."
5,"great off brand buy, good buy for the price","For the price and being an off brand, this was an awesome purchase. The brightness is very strong and the ratio is perfect for watching DVD's, surfing webpages, or having multiple windows open.The only thing I would change if I had designed this monitor is the stand, but it does not affect my home setup. The stand is very limited in how it can be configured."
4,Very Good Monitor,"This Is My First Lcd So I Decided To Give It Four Stars ,Plus The Best Is Always Yet To Come.I Had This Monitor For A Month Now And It Is Fantastic.I'm Using It At The Native Resolution With An XFX Nvidia GPU 6600le PCI Xpress Card. The Resolution Is Good And The The DVD's Look Really Fantastic .So Far They Are No Dead Pixels . (Thank God)They Are Only Two Issues I Have With This Monitor ;(1)The VGA And DVI connectors Are Too Close ,(2)That Piece Of Plastic Scrap That Covers The Lcd Face Is Too Flimsy . I Would Like To See Manufactures Cover The Face With Glass So That You Can Clean The Screen Properly And Not Have To Worry About Touching Or Applying Too Much Pressure On The Screen To Cause Any Dead Pixels .I Recommend This Monitor As Value For Your Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Overrated,"Yes, the picture quality is good. Yes, the price is reasonable. Assembly was easy and cables are included. However, the monitor feels a little flimsy (i.e. it wobbles on the stand when you move it). Also, the speakers are on the back of the unit, so the sound quality is poor unless you are behind the thing."
5,"A compelling book, and excellently written","This book makes a really compelling case for managing under the paradigm of loyalty underlying the foundation of every business. As a student of business administration I was very fascinated by Reichheld's systemic approach to the topic. Though Reichheld keeps superficial at some times he goes remarkably deep at other times proving his assumptions with real numbers. These examples throughout the book are very interesting and always straight to the point. Adding to the fun of reading this book is the excellent style delivering messages that they are easy to grasp, while Reichheld does not simplify too much. I would definitely recommend the book to any business students and anyone interested in a systemic and common sense approach to management away from the ballyhoo slogans of some management books."
5,"Great timeless lessons. The ""fluff"" of business IS THE BUSINESS.","Never has one book helped crystallize more disparate fundamentals of business than this one. How do you value a firm? How do you value an employee? How much should spend to solve a customer's issue? What are bad profits and what are they costing you? How do you earn investor loyalty? It's all here and distilled with the clarity and thoroughness of a world class management consultant and teacher.This is not a quick read per se, but it is well worth the time you invest. If you have ever thought of the happiness of your customers, employees, and investors as ""fluff"", this may change your thinking. Instead, think DCF of your customer, employee, and investor relationships...put a number to them. Maximize that number. You may find that it requires taking your eye off the bottom line for a minute, but you can trust Mr. Reichheld that the bottom line will be better for it."
3,Very insightful...yet somehow flawed,"Reichheld's The Loyalty Effect is by far one of the most mediocre books on business loyalty that I have ever read. Instead of having the Tumba Wumbas, as the other leading book on loyalty did, this book simply presented the facts. True, it's interesting to some extent...but when analyzed in detail, there's not much there that I'm sure you didn't already know."
3,it's worth the money,O my I had gotton my son a blow up pool and i had probably sat outside blowing it up for about an hour (only about half of it was filled)then i just decided that i had had enough so i went to the store picked this up (because it was the cheapest electric pump they had.) And now after i have it i would pay anything for it. its been a lifesaver i never realized how much i would use it!! I love it
1,Save your money,Our pool arrived during our heat wave. And it was promptly filled with air and water. It promptly emptied of air and water. There were multiple holes in the bottom of the pool as well as in the bottom ring of the pool. A large disappointment to my children and to myself.
2,Ripped on the 3rd use,"This pool initially was great. A good size for my daughter and me to play in, easy to set up and take down. On the 3rd use, not 5 minutes after we got into the water, a 2 inch split occurred and we needed to abandon ship. Currently waiting for the patch to set before we get back in. I have been cautious not to over inflate the pool and to make sure it is free of sharp areas below it. I am really disappointed that we have not made it through any of our summer yet and the pool already is falling apart. Not impressed at all."
5,"Durable, gret for the toddler set","I bought this pool for my son and this is the third year that we've used it. Believe it or not, my very active son has outgrown this pool before even one hole has appeared!!! This pool has endured lots of acrobatic jumping and even made an appearance at a 'Gross' birthday party for 15 kids as the slime pit. It still doesn't have a puncture!! My son is 7 this summer and he is actually too big for it (he likes to jump in it and since he is 52 inches tall this pool is too small for that activity). I never expected when I bought this pool that I would be 'handing it down' to someone else years later!"
5,The kids love it,"We just took it out for a test drive today. My 2 yr old and 1 yr old absolutely love it! Place it on the grass because when they get moving in there and slip and fall, you'll be glad you did. It's wonderful for the price!"
5,Fabulous and Fun Buy,My grandson turned 1 year old this month so I thought getting him a little pool would be great. I was going to get a tiny baby pool but read bad reviews on most. This one advertises for 3+but it looked great and no one hopefully would ever put a little child of any age in any pool.Well we absolutely love it. It is a perfect size and Mom and Dad can get in it with him and they all love it. My grandson holds the top of the pool and walks all the way around it and even being wet it is not at all slippery. I would advize anyone to make this purchase. I sure am thrilled that I did.
4,Good pool for small yard,Just bought it for my daughter this summer and she loves it. Product is decent size for our small yard. It does need electric pump it fill air. I setup mine in no time. The pool remained inflated for more than a day before I needed to fill more air in. Packing it up was easy too..will see how long does it lasts before it needs a repair.
5,fantastic pool,"For the kids at least, this pool was the hit of the party. It takes a lot of air to blow it up, you might want to find a machine to help if possible. We just rinse it out and store it upside-down. Highly recommended."
3,No drain plug!,"Just received this pool. Seems durable and decent size, but no drain plug as advertised. Ridiculous not to have a drain in a pool this size. Will have to deflate it to drain it otherwise will have to use a bucket to get the water out."
4,Good for the price,"good pool for [...] bucks, its spacious enough for a couple kids age 3-4 yrs old, maybe 3 kids but i think thats pushing it. 2 is optimal. got this because i live in japan right now and backyard is small (if you want to call it a backyard), so this pool worked out well, but if youre in the US then i think it would be better to spend the extra cash to get a bigger one."
1,Don't bother!,This item was horrible. I inflated it but then put it aside for the next day. Went back to it to discover it was 1/2 way deflated! The two screw caps that seal the air in the two rings leaks! I can't even return it because I threw the box away. Disappointing!
1,No Rainbow Here!,"I was very disappointed in this book. My little one asked me why were there not any dark girls in it? I told her I did not know why. But being an a dark skinned black woman, I know why. Yes, you better believe small children take note of this disparity in our race."
4,Good book a girl of any age,"Pinkett Smith pens a poem dedicated to the beauty and strength of women and young girls. Photographs of females of all ages, race and ethnic backgrounds are included. Pinkett Smith is also featured with her daughter. The book speaks to why it's special to be girl and the bond of sisterhood we share with each other A girl of any age will enjoy reading this book."
5,Girls Hold Up the World,"This is one of the best books for ""all"" girls no matter what age. I am giving this book to every female in my family and some of my best friends. I mark the page(s) that exemplify the character of each individual and write a special note in the inside cover. Every page has an inspiring message. THIS IS A GREAT, GREAT BOOK!!"
3,"Great message, poor delivery","Don't get me wrong, I think the message is very important. But the quality of the photography and graphics is seriously lacking. It seems more like a family album than even a modest portrayal of cultural and ethnic diversity in a children's book. I wonder how long did it took them to put this together.. A weekend?"
1,Is that all?,"When making this book there was probebly an afford to make something that means something and gives advice to girls (at least that's what I heard Jada tell at Oprah), but it's feels and looks empty. Not only because of the lack of words, there is no story, but 80% of the photographs is allso not really up to standard.I like Jada Pinkett Smith very much, she's a strong women and a great rollmodel, but this books does not do her justice."
1,I was going to buy until....,"I was going to purchase this book until I read there were no dark-skinned little girls in it.Wow! that's pretty disappointing. As a dark-skinned mother with a daughter who's maybe a shade lighter than me but the same type of beautiful hair (among other features), I want to read to her about our beauty as darker skinned women.No sale here. Maybe I'll write a book :-)"
2,"Commendable concept, poor execution","I wanted to like this book. Really, I did. As a parent of a young girl, I'm all for children's books that are geared toward empowering girls and encouraging self-esteem.However, this particular effort falls short. The text is made up mostly of empty, vague platitudes that are connected through forced, painful rhymes. Some of the photos are nice, but they mostly give the impression that someone spent an hour randomly picking stock photo images of girls and women. In general, this book feels like it was assembled from start to finish in a few hours. I can't imagine it would have seen the light of day without a celebrity's name attached.Fortunately, we only checked this book out from the library, so we didn't spend any money on it and we don't have to read it again."
5,I loved this book!,"I am a dark skinned mother and am very aware, having biracial children, of the images they are exposed to. There is a picture of at least one dark skinned girl in the book that I can think of off the top of my head. There is a young beautiful dark skinned preteen listening and dancing to her music. I love the fact that this book shows girls and women of all shades."

5,"The lost art of writing, is still alive.","Many years ago, I bought Ilene Segaloves' ""Unwritten Letters"" and using it and writing in this wonderful journal helped me through some of my darkest moments in life. There is something so very profound and real about putting to paper our most intimate thoughts and feelings. I find that this book ""The Write Mood "" is already helping me sort out my feeling , helping me to again discover my true self, being honest, as I write down with a pen, what I feel about all the things that affect my life and that of others dear to me. Writing is better than laying in a therapist couch and cheaper too! Writing on paper with a pen or pencil is so therapeutic because that is the way we all learned how to first write and read. It is tangible,personal, a form of art that in today's world of high tech....is all lost. Thank you for helping me obtain it . I truly appreciate your help and excellent service!"
4,WARNING...Graphic Gang Rape Scene,"This was a great movie overall,but the gang rape of that guy was brutal. Very disturbing. And then he suddenly realizes he was gay all the time? Totally gratuitous and ridiculous."
3,Homoerotic Art,"This is what I look in a movie: you get to see naked bodies without being porno. The Homoerotic concept is beautiful. However, the music and the final are too deppresing. Specially the music: I just wanted to use the mute botton several times in order to get rid of it. The other critic is to find out that the person who needed the most to find love and stay with this at the end of the movie, just took the wrong decision (the gay issue) which makes no sense. When are we going to find a good movie where the gays just live together and for ever? Why the prostitute? Anyway, it is worth to see it."
1,Who would want to watch this?,I could not find anything in this movie that would cause me to recommend it to anyone. Especially offensive to my wife an me are the graphic homoerotic scenes - and I mean graphic. I don't care to see heterosexual sex organs in the act of copulation; even less so in oral homosexual sex. This is not really a movie - it is pornography disguised as a movie. If I could give this movie '0' stars I would.
4,This one is worth it!,"That was one of the better books I've read in a while.Told in the difficult to write ""first person"", the story draws the reader into the past and into a vibrant and unforgiving city. The setting is a place we've all imagined but have never quite experienced.Good characterization and interesting storyline. I'm looking out for the next in the series."
5,Homeless man as detective?,"Believe it or not, the story works. Rosemary Aubert writes like a dream. Her protagonist, Ellis Portal, offers us a glimpse into a world we hope never to enter. The mystery is as compelling as the hero. I'm not going to go on and on about the story as some reviewers do. I'll only say this: To those mystery lovers who yearn for a masterfully told tale, snap this one up!"
3,Dated.,"Yes, this play is a classic that inspired an opera from which we have the William Tell Overture and yes we the love the episode in which the title character shoots the apple off his son's head but on the whole this short book is a slow go. There is a lot of vowing to defend the homeland from the evil leaders and a lot of angst about the desire for freedom but is a bit repetitious. Also,there is a good deal of organizing patriotic groups and traveling from spot to spot. I think I would rather see the opera than read the play because at least there would be some visual stimulation."
1,"cute, but dangerous?","This set is cute, and very well priced. The only problem I have with the set is that the manufacturer did not put ties on the top AND BOTTOM in the center of the bumper pads. The other set I purchased by Kidsline had both ties in the center, and it never moved. The bumper from this set is all over the place, and I have entered my son's room with his face covered by the pad. I finally had enough, and I'm taking the set back before my son becomes a statistic."

3,Very Helpful and Informative book! All you need.,"I was amazed! This is a wonderful book on feng shui. I have purchased other books on feng shui that seemed 'pretty' accurate and 'kind of' helpful, but this one is right on the mark. She takes you through all the necessary steps to learning how to really do feng shui on your home or business. At first I was leary of learning the Nine Pallace or Flying Stars form of feng shui. It seemed to complicated to figure out for a person not raised in a budhist or taoist environment, but Eva Wong's book walks you through it step by step. Complete with tests and work sheets so you can make sure you know your stuff! Seriously a great book!"
2,Too Much for Too Little,"Having enjoyed many of Lillian Too's books, I bought this one as soon as it was released. What a disappointment and what confusion! The book wasn't sequenced well and it was hard to know what to focus on in order to understand flying star feng shui. Too many concepts were included that could have been tabled for another book. I hope the Skinner book is more systematic in its approach so I can learn flying star feng shui."
4,Good,"There are not many good books on classical feng shui in the market. This is one of them. This book is very detailed and informative. Feng Shui is a very sophisticated art and many books out there either over-simplify the subject or the just do not have a clue. However it can get a little dry sometimes but if you are serious enthusiast, this is a minor problem. Eva Wong should write more books."
2,Disappointed,I found the information that the book offered to be sound. I was very disapointed with the small black and white photosand illustrations. The publication seemed low buget. It would ba a useful book for evaluating a building plan and location.
5,Wonderful -- Tori is brilliant!!,"Boys for Pele is my first Tori CD.. but not my last. It is a brilliant, moving, beautiful CD and I plan to buy her others in the near future. I have listened to every song on this CD, and every one has it's own unique, rythmic meaning. Not to mention her voice is outstanding... cheers to Tori!"
4,Beautiful,"This was my first album by Tori, but I had heard all of her hits up to this point. She worked her way through this album with a sort of sweet vocals that remind me of Natalie Merchant or Sarah McLachlan, the songs are sulky, but never whiny. This c.d. is good very good."
2,Great to makeout to,"Man, my boyfriend and I really got it on to ""Caught a Lite Sneeze"". That song really helps you get your groove on. Forget viagra! Buy this album, put on #7 and do your thing people!"
2,Baffling.,"I don't understand why so many Tori fans claim this is her best work. The music is-- for the most part-- jarring, and sometimes downright ugly. There are only a few bright spots, ""Hey Jupiter"" and ""Twinkle"" among them, although the Dakota Version of ""Hey Jupiter"" is superior to the album version. It can be found on the Hey Jupiter EP, which I'd recommend buying instead; go to one of the major Tori fansites to hear live versions of ""Marianne"" and ""Twinkle."" Those, at least, you'll find worth your time."
3,The Ultimate in Pretentious,"I'm only a causual Tori Amos Fan (if there is such a thing) and found the album to be her most awkward yet. I'm sure die-hard Tori fans love it, and I'm sure there is much to like, but I just didn't find it worth the effort. Song after song of harpsichords and lyrics about bloody priests. For those wanting a more accessible intro to Tori, try From the Choirgirl Hotel."
5,her last good album,ever since boys for pele tori amos has continued surely and steadily down the path of mediocrity.Her first three albums were pieces and worthy of their price.this album shows the artist reaching for and hitting the mark.her last three have seen her sell out and dance with mediocrity.
2,"Tori Amos fan, but this is the worst","I love Tori Amos work, but of all her albums, the only one I simply dislike is Boys for Pele. It is way too long and only a few songs are worth the price. These are: Horses, Blood Roses, Caught a Lite Sneeze, Talula, Doughtnot Hole, and Putting the Damage On. The rest seem to go anywhere. Good thing she improved in her subsequent albums."
3,Too Much To Handle,"The songs are good. The music is good. But it's been proven that you can have too much of a good thing. Tori Amos almost shuts the listeners out on a deeply personal, and very lengthly record. One thing that Tori Amos adds to her musical repetoire is more verve and lyrical spontienity than usual. In fact, a lot of tracks on the album are much loved....but even then it leaves the rest of the album to be dubbed as ""remotely dull"". Maybe Amos should stay on American soil while making her next album."
1,Talented artist seriously stumbles on her third go around,"The first pair of Amos' albums proved her to be a vital and talented artist - a writer of gorgeous melodies, startling lyrics, and imaginative musical arrangements. Unfortunately on her third go around she is dangerously close to self-parody with an unfocused piece of work that does little to alter her growing image as a self righteous, humorless, man hater (the later of which is reinforced by the album's title and cover photo) who sadly just may be running out of musical ideas. While songs like ""Blood Roses"" ""Talua"" and ""Caught A Lite Sneeze"" hint at the promise of her first two albums, far too many others undercut the momentum Amos gained with her debut and its follow up. If you still think you might be interested in this CD, save the dough and hit the used CD bins first. I run into this one all the time there."
4,This album is exquisite!,"The songs in Pele definitely have its own distinctive style compared to Little Earthquakes. Why I give this album 4 stars is simply because it suits my taste. Hey Jupiter, Talula and Caught a Lite Sneeze are my favourite in this ablum. However, Little Earthquake would always be my first choice as the album are more digestable compared to Pele. I guess, I will need some time before I get used to her lyrics that are so obscure.Also check out the Hey Jupiter EP single. It has new version of Hey Jupiter and Professional Widow. It also includes live tracks such as Sugar, Honey and Somewhere Over the Rainbow ..... A good buy for any Tori fans .."
3,Not without its merits...,"..but also not without a few hangups. These, however, are easily-enough overlooked if you have any familiarity with where Tori Amos has come from musically. Admittedly, this is not my favorite of her albums. I enjoy _Little Earthquakes_ and _Under the Pink_ a great deal more as whole albums since conceptually, I think they appeal to a broader range of interests. The reasons which keep me from enjoying _Boys For Pele_ as much are mostly due to the overwrought anger put on display. I enjoyed a few tracks off this album, such as ""Muhammad My Friend"" and ""Caught a Lite Sneeze."" And, as always, her gift for understatement/overstatement is on wild display in her use of the piano, her voice, and lyrics. Check it out if you're already a fan of hers, as I am."
5,Maybe 4 1/2...,"I liked this album, really I did. I just didn't like it as much as I liked Little Earthquakes or Under the Pink. It was still really good. Tori used this album to expiriment with new insturnments and heavier sounds. I think her lyrics got deeper too. This album was a pretty big change from Pink, but everyone shouold give it a shot. Don't forget to purchase Tori's albums in order of when they came out. That is very important."
1,Overwrought and pretentious,"After a pair of albums with undeniably compelling moments, Tori Amos seems to be coasting at best, and pandering at worst, with Boys For Pele.Pretentious and overwrought, Boys For Pele indulges in the worst aspects of her first two albums, while virtually ignoring ""Little Earthquakes"" and ""Under The Pink's"" best moments.Here's hoping that ""Boys For Pele"" is not a trend in Amos's still growing career."
2,EVER HEARD OF KATE BUSH?,"Wow, person from Ellensburg WA, one of the most original artist EVER? I would strongly urge you to listen to almost ANYTHING by Kate Bush and you will find that she was doing this twenty years ago. Note for note, phrase for phrase. Every note Amos sings is an attempt to sound like Kate Bush. I strongly urge you to check it out and you'll see what I'm saying. This is not something I say loosely. It would be obvious to almost anyone I think."
1,Very disapointing,"I loved her Little Earthquakes and Under the pink, but this cd is just not upto her standards."
1,Ahh! What Happened?!?,This album is TERRIBLE compared to other albums of hers. Definitely the worst. If you look at this - put it down. Have somebody make a tape of it for you.
1,Simply Awful,"I know the maximum words I can have for this space is 1,000 words but I could go further on bashing this album. What is sad about it and what makes me even more disappointed is that I am a very big fan of Tori. ""Under The Pink"" was strange, ""Little Earthquakes"" was the best, and ""Boys For Pele"" is terrible! The songs go nowhere except to Whineville. The one star was for the so-so song ""Caught In A Light Sneeze"" and the passable ""Hey Jupiter."" The rest is junk. I could use this CD as a coaster."
4,a little evil,"Unlike ""Little Earthquake"", this album is a little evil. There are some powerful guitar sound, those who are customed to Tori's beautiful piano sound will be a little disppointed. But still a very good album, worth the price"
4,"For anyone else, it would have been 5 stars.","While there are a few great songs on this one (Hey, Jupiter, Caught a Lite Sneeze, Mr. Zebra), it pales in comparison to her stronger efforts such as ""Little Earthquakes"" and ""To Venus and Back"". For someone who's already a fan of Tori's this is a must-buy, but there are better introductions to her lovely blend of a beautiful voice and exquisite melodies."
5,Primal sounds,"Pele remains one of my favorite Tori albums. It is one of her most raw (sonically and lyrically). So many tracks stand out on there own - Caught a Lite Sneeze, Hey Jupiter, Little Amsterdam. But the album as a whole is a jounrey - sort of mourning process, moving from rage and bitterness to acceptance and peace."
5,The Complex and Eccentric Work that is Boys for Pele,"Boys for Pele was the first album of Tori's I ever listened to. I was all at once amazed and confused. But as I listened to it more and more, I fell in love and now I own all of Tori's albums. Pele is my favorite. Tori has an amazing ability to convince you. An unworldly voice, and honest lyrics. That is how I would sum up Boy's for Pele . . . honest. Pent up sexual frustration, pain, beauty, and complexity. Pele is a genuine work of raw and rare art. Very few artists have the kind of depth Tori does. She showcases her unique artistic perseption to the fullest extent on this album."
5,Another Great Album From Tori,This album is probably one of the albums i listen to the most on a daily basis. Its so personal and fragile but also one of the most darkest album by Tori. With beautiful church like sounds and its just amazing how Toris voice shows how shes really feeling. Like with Proffesional Widow and Caught A Light Sneeze you cant really get away from it. But theres also the very sad ballads like Hey Jupiter and Marianne. The album includes 4 intros that are short funny little songs like Mr. Zebra. But all in all this album is just wow to me even though some may disagree or have huge opinions about but really you have to look through it and im sure that after youve heard the album more then once it will become apart of you. Thats also if your a Tori fan to begin with but if your not then i would strongly suggest that you buy Little Earthquakes and work your way up.
4,grows on you,"I like Choirgirl Hotel so much that I've recently been dragging out my other Tori CD's and giving them another listen. This one was a hard sell but I'm starting to like how different and strange it is. I still don't listen to the whole thing straight through... I admit I'm not into it that much. But I just discovered ""Little Amsterdam"" and now I can't get it out of my head. ""Hey Jupiter"" is addictive too."
4,"Tori's most ""difficult"" album","I love to give this CD to people and say, ""Listen and tell me what you think of Tori."" I am a HUGE fan and even I set this one aside for a long time before picking it back up and giving it a long listen.I have been won over. Everytime I listen to ""Hey Jupiter"" I am reminded of the searing vision of Tori's art. It is a gorgeous piece of music. What is it about? Oh, I have my own theory ... and it makes me enjoy it even more.Another song, ""Putting the Damage On"" is an emotional masterpiece (and totally unrecognized in the Tori repertoire). Maybe that's what happens when the song is track 17 of 18. It's a lot like ""Northern Lad,"" probably my favorite Tori song of all time (and also unrecognized).This CD is so much darker and solemn, breathy and strange than her other works.After several years, I like it. Maybe I am just now beginning to understand it."
4,Fresh and original; not as angry as previous CD's.,"Tori has clearly matured to have produced this daring, yet innovative CD. The music has improved from a sentimental sweet sounding anger to a more refined standard."
5,I see that star,"Despite the personal nature of Amos' former release, this one is perhaps the most raw in terms of relationships and her treatment of herself. I love the new areas of sound she chose to explore on this CD. Definitely a keeper."
2,"Her voice is lyrical, but...","Amos has a beautiful voice and I like her music. However, almost without exception these lyrics are completely senseless to me. Perhaps I'm just too shallow, but it's all gibberish."
2,This can't be Tori...,"Tori Amos really screwed up on this album. I couldn't find one song on the entire album that I REALLY liked. Every song had something that I didn't like in it - except maybe Hey Jupiter. Really pathetic. Tori, why did you make this awful album. You should base your albums like you did on Little Earthquakes and Under the Pink. This album is too crappy to come from such a talented artist."
3,A musicial version of Sylvia Plath's Ariel,"A musicial version of Sylvia Plath's Ariel.If Little Earthquakes was a musical version of Plath's Bell Jar then this is definitly Ariel.Not for new fans, I still don't understand it, but there are some songs which are genius.Her religious concept is superb: Pele, Lucifer, Jupiter... exemplifies depth in knowledge!"
5,tori amos needs no introduction,"This has to be, by far, my favorite of the tori amos albums. While everything that comes out of this woman's mouth is wonderful, this album holds a special place in my heart. The songs have a little bit of everything in them, from tender ballad, to angry grrr song. I recommend first time tori tasters to try this first before dipping into others, you'll truly either love her or hate her, if you have any soul, you'll love her uncontrolably."
2,very disappointing,I really liked her first two albums so I bought this one.Should have saved my money.The lyrics make no sense whatsoever.Just a bunch of meaningless words thrown together.
2,Tori's Deranged Twin Releases an Album...,"Don't get me wrong - I love Tori Amos - but this album sounds so unfinished and undeveloped that I just cannot listen to it very often. I also agree that ""Under the Pink"" is the best. This album is less angry and just not worthy of Tori's artistry. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT."
2,dissapointed,"Although I believe that Tori Amos is a very talented person, as shown by other albums from Little Earthquakes to From The Choirgirl Hotel, I think she has failed in this album. I sounds like she maybe tried a little to hard to keep up with what she had going and instead came up with a bunch a noise that is slightly unpleasent to listen to."
2,At best - this is mediocre.,Very displeased. Tori stumbled off of a cliff and landed in a bed of thorns - or at least - that what she sounds like. The songs are okay - but her voice sounds so STRANGE. I don't know what happened... but I DON'T like it.
2,The Ultimate Letdown...,"I don't think that I've ever been so disappointed by a CD before. ""Under the Pink"" is the best album. This album just doesn't please me. Every song has something that doesn't belong - which makes it so that you can't listen to it very often...Grade: C"
2,How could Tori be responsible for this?!?,"This album is okay, but for Tori, it is utter crap. Don't read the other reviews becuase they're not tellin the truth. It is an OKAY album, but if you're used to the quality of her other albums, YOU WILL BE SHOCKED. Have someone make you a tape - this CD JUST IS NOT THAT GOOD!!!! Listen to it if you will, but there are too many unnecessary moans and squeals that it makes this album nearly SUCK. I LOVE TORI AND HAVE ALL OF HER ALBUMS, BUT THIS ONE WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT. People say that this album carries them away to ""dreamland"" - well, it only took me to the garbage dump. C-."
3,Confusion Abounds,"Though attempting to be ambitious musically, BOYS FOR PELE also provides ammo for those who think of Tori Amos as nothing but pretentious. Judging from the contents that lie within, it's easy to see why she sometimes gets the criticism. The bulk of the album is bogged down by lyrically confusing songs, as if to be so for confusion's sake. Many of the songs don't seem to connect logically, even from verse to verse, and the confusion isn't made palpable by her vocals, which become increasingly more florid--even incoherent occasionally--with each release. This is not to say there aren't some good tracks here--particularly 'Professional Widow' and 'Caught A Lite Sneeze', but the majority of the album seems to crawl, meandering often at a snails pace, and thus failing to alleviate the already confused state some of the tracks leave the listener in. Overall, BFP remains Amos' least accessible, and ultimately most inconsequential, record to date."
5,"Haunting, lyrical music will captivate you again and again","This CD was my first exposure to Tori Amos, and because of it I plan to buy all the rest of her albums and listen to them again and again, as long as they are as good as this one! I was awestruck by Tori's honest and chilling lyrics, so poetical and beautiful. I loved her skillful piano playing just as much, and both combined made for one of the best CD's I have ever listened to. I think Tori is one of the most talented singers today, and I am impressed at how she is individual enough to do her own thing without trying to cop whatever is popular and hip right now.Turn to Tori Amos' ""Boys for Pele"" and hear a refreshing mix of bold lyrics, beautiful voice, and talented piano-playing. I know I am gushing in my praise for this CD, but it is one of the best I have heard in a long time, so just buy it already and you'll see what I mean. :o)"
5,A beautiful album!,"Boys for Pele is definitely one of Tori's finest albums. Although some this album may be an acquired taste to some, with time it proves to be an honest, witty, and emotional gem. Amos has the most interesting way of looking at life, as one can see from her creative, somewhat twisted lyrics. Songs such as Caught a Lite Sneeze, The Doughnut Song, and Blood Roses are absolutely outstanding!"
3,"Good, but not great...","A definite let down from ""Under the Pink"" (which IS Tori's best), this album is full of groans and moans which take away the essence in every song. I have owned this album for more than a year now, and I can't seem to find a song that doesn't have anything unnecessary in it. For example, ""In the Springtime of his Voodoo"" starts off with a minute and a half of babble and a language that you can't understand. I hated the album at first, but I've began to like it a little more. I listen to it occasionally, but not that often. Professional Widow, Hey Jupiter, and Little Amsterdam rise above the rest, but not VERY high. Definitely, Tori's worst album. I hope that she improves over the years and NEVER stumbles to this low point again. Good album for some, not good for Tori."
4,Does anybody actually read these reviews?,"I wonder.This is a great album. Not as catchy as most of her material except for ""Caught A Light Sneeze"" but the others are excellent. I bought a cassette version for my car (that came w/ a tape player!) and have listened to it over and over. It is becoming my most listened to album now. Good for long drives and even a quick trip to the liquor store!;-)It is like a nice long and deep conversation w/ a good friend. A quiet, beautiful and sensitive friend. Listen with care. You are amazing Tori Amos."
1,AVOID THIS VERSION OF THE CULT ALBUM!!!,"BUYERS BEWARE! This is not the original edition of Boys For Pele. Whoever substitutes original Tori songs for REMIXES should be crucified indeed. How dare they take out In The Springtime of His Voodoo to put on that Professional Widow remix???? Honestly, I am sure Tori was unaware of this, she'd have never allowed it. Look for the original album!"
2,A disappointing alternate version of a great album.,"A very unnecessary release put out by Atlantic to showcase the success of Armand Van Helden's remix of ""Professional Widow."" The remix is placed after the original version of the song and largely breaks up the albums feel, and quite frankly, some of its integrity. And since ""Pele"" is a longer album, the remix displaces ""In the Springtime of His Voodoo,"" further disturbing the album. The original release of ""Boys for Pele"" is a complex and often beautiful, though sometimes harsh, piece of work that asks the listener to look deeper. Bottom line: unless you're a serious collector, stick with the original release of the album - less money, less hassle, and a lot more of the piano songstress's intricately woven world."
4,As rewarding as it is challenging...,"Boys For Pele is a dense, moody and often indecipherable work. Hard to listen to from start to finish without a cigarette, Pele is full of wordy psychoses, a clear inspiration for Alanis Morissette's Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie.Fortunately the clatter of Professional Widow and In The Springtime of His Voodoo (both undeniably great songs) is tempered with ballads Hey Jupiter and Putting The Damage On, and the unassuming pop of Talula and Caught A Lite Sneeze.It gets a bit heavy-handed at times but it's a rewarding work and Marianne is simply one of the most beautiful and personal songs of her career."
4,"Not her best, but better than most","Tori recieved a Grammy nomination for this album when it is inferior to Little Earthquakes, and (according to my girlfriend) Under the Pink. But though it isn't her best, it's far better than the tired, sorry-ass music of groups like The Backstreet Boys, Oasis, and Matchbox 20. Tori manages to mangle several songs will ill-advised and ill-executed refrains, but ignoring these brief and sparse lapses in judgement, it's a great album."
3,Boys for Pele is like an abstract painting.,"I have a love/hate relationship with this album. One one hand, I like the abstract, strange lyrics and the harpsichord. On the other hand, I still don't know what the hell ""ratotuille restrychonine"" is supposed to mean.The main problem with Boys for Pele is that at times Tori stops singing and starts wailing. I love ""Blood Roses"" until the part where Tori where screams ""God knows I've thrown away these graces..."" I turn down the volume during certain parts of ""Professional Widow.""However, there are still many good songs on Boys for Pele. My favorites are ""Horses,"" ""Caught a Lite Sneeze"" (dreamlike, stream of conciousness lyrics), ""Hey Jupiter,"" ""Father Lucifer,"" and ""Muhammed my Friend.""Listen to Boys for Pele, but don't try to analyze the lyrics."
3,an intriguing but unsuccessful album,"With the revelation of the professional review above, i've added half a star to my review. Her first two albums had real, fully formed songs. Pele has too much of Tori's somewhat strained singing and her piano with some sound effects. Plus both the album as a whole and many of the songs are overlong. Ultimatly a noble failure, but it has it's moments"
5,this is my favorite one,"i absolutely love this cd. it shows that tori is a very intelligent and talented person. she makes refrences to such a wide range of events and people all in one album. thats probably not so easy. my favorite songs are marianne and the dougnut song. oh yeah, i cant forget twinkle. however, i could see how a lot of people could get a tad bit irritated at this album. its knida long but i think thats why i love it so much. there is more tori to listen to!!"
5,"Not her best work, but it's still Tori!","This was the first Tori album that I bought, and it is the album that got me hooked to her music. I always loved this album; however, when listening to ""Little Earthquakes"" and ""Under the Pink"", I realized that ""Boys For Pele"" simply does not hold a candle to them. Most people will find the lyrics beyond the realms of interpretation. I suggest that a listener of ""Boys For Pele"" simply lay down, close one's eyes, and appreciate Tori's musical genius. One will get more out of ""Boys For Pele"" if they don't dissect it with a sharp scalpel."
5,"Face it people, a different Tori is here to stay","This album took some getting used to...but after many, many listens, I LOVE IT! Give it several chances, and don't expect easy grokkings."
4,Great CD for the most part :-),"This was the third Tori CD I bought in my spree of Tori, this is when i herd a song on the radio and feel in love with her music. This CD has many great songs, Caught a Lite Sneeze, Mr. Zebra, and Talula to name a few. I really enjoy this release as it contains the most amount of Tori songs I enjoy."
1,At first I was swept away...,"Then I heard some things.. alot of things I can't listen to Tori Amos now because of. Her ""Father (you know who)"" track is evil. Her various references to God and Christians throughout this album are evil as well. At first I enjoyed Tori's music for how happy it sounded, despite some of the subject matter, and lets face it, she has a nice voice, and plays well. In the end, though, my opinion of her music is a sugarcube dripping with evil at the center."
3,Pele,"Tori's third album goes back to her piano roots but it fails to work.Most of the songs don't make any sense or they drag on.I did not like Little Amsterdam, Not the Red Baron, Agent Orange or In the Springtime of His Voodoo.The only thing that saves this album is tracks like Horses, Blood Roses,Professional Widow, and Caught a light sneeze.If you've never heard a Tori album I recommend Little Earthquakes or her b-sides. Songs like Upside Down, Take to the Sky, Siren, Sugar, and Honey are Tori at her best."
2,Not her greatest,"Being a pretty well versed fan of Tori's work, I was very dissapointed when this album came out. There are a few gems that make the album worth a purchase, but only if you like her previous work. Go for Little Earthquakes or Choirgirl Hotel for better music."
5,This little amplifier saved the day,"My husband has 50% hearing in one ear, no hearing in the other. So when his hearing aide quit working the week before an important meeting, it was a big deal! With the hearing aide sent back for repairs, I searched the web and found this Clarity Personal Listener. The seller (an Amazon seller) went out of their way to get it to us quickly.The device doesn't take the place of his $2,000 programable hearing aide, but it does work exactly as it claims to work- it amplifys sound, has a limited adjustment range for ""tone"" and is fairly inconspicuous when tucked in a shirt pocket. My husband even cut a hole in the back of his shirt pocket and threaded the earpiece wire through it so it wouldn't be noticable. It helped him get through the day-long meeting. The only trouble he had was during lunch when there was alot of background noise that made it difficult to hear the conversation.The Clarity Personal Listener saved the day."
2,Not for a long-term Hearing Aid,Do NOT use this as a long-term Hearing Aid!! The batteries only last for 2 or 3 hours before dying and need to be replaced!!
4,Good for the price,"I was a little hesitant after poor review stating that the unit didn't work right out of the box, but I went ahead and gambled the $46. To my disappointment, the unit showed exactly the same symptoms described by the other reviewer. The thing would work for a couple of seconds and cut out. After trying non-rechargeable batteries and various combinations of buttons I happened to take a closer look at the battery cover. It's here where I found the problem... at the very top of the battery compartment there are the usual + and - symbols, so I put the batteries in so that the symbol matched the part of the battery that was outward facing. But looking at the cover the symbols were reversed.... what was meant was that the symbol on the device was actually the end of the battery meant to be buried int he device and the symbols on the inside of the little cover were the outward facing ends. Once I reversed the batteries and charged them, the unit worked as described."
2,Not of any help,"The company offering this product is good and they may have other products which may be of great value, but this personal listner is no good. The microphone is of low sensitivity and the other person will have to talk right on the microphone for it to catch the sound waves. Also when the unit is in the pocket and the earphone on the ear, the microphone and the ear speaker resonate and make a loud Coooooo sound. This is not a pratical solution to a person who is really hard of hearing."
1,SUCT!,It amplified minimally.I bought a similar gizmo at radio shack for $19.99 that worked much better.
1,Disappointed,The product in no way lives up to the info on it. I used it with an open door with an open hallway to a downstairs kitchen. Heard only murmuring.
1,messy mish-mosh of uninspired stuff,"As a hardcore fan of some of the beautiful new romantic music of Midge Ure, I was excited at the rerelease of this out of print collection, hoping to find at least a few b-side gems featuring his gorgeous melodies and vocals. Instead, this disc is filled with--well--filler. There's a reason these tracks were b-sides. They sound like it cost nothing to record them. It's all experimental ambient synth stuff, without vocals. The live tracks are--well--LIVE, and I much prefer the original studio recordings. The instrumental versions of some Ultravox singles are a waste of disc space. The ""special mix"" of 'heart of the country' runs over 10 minutes, and is somewhat excessive, and the 'final mix' of One Small Day is ok, but lacks the punch of the one amazing 12"" version I have never seen on CD, the US 12"" mix that was the flip side of the US 12"" mix of Dancing With Tears in My Eyes, which I have also never seen on CD. Too bad they didn't make it to this 'rare' series."
1,4 holes in my car bumper!!!!!,"I'm going to be short. I waste my Sunday break, I got 4 holes in my bumper (nice), this thing didn't work."
1,ggood but will cost 200$ to install,no one tells you it will cost 200$ to install. so i eneded up with the product unused because i will not spend 200 for a 30 dollar purchase...
3,It's just okay,I had the unit professionally installed by a collision shop that I trust. The drill bit in the package was damaged and they were unable to use it. The sensors do not have any kind of clip to hold them in place and the shop advised me to keep an eye on them as they may tend to pop out although they said they will not come all the way out. I had this done about a week ago and I have had one of them already pop out and had to push it back in.
3,Not what i expected,"I ordered it based on the picture shown and the item description. I wanted a system with at least 4 sensors (like the image and description says) but the system i received isnt the system shown nor does it have 4 sensors. It has two. Everything else is ok (i did get the boring tool), but its not what i expected"
2,Looks nice but far from reliable,"Installed the system in the metal bumper of my 2004 Nissan Frontier. Couldn't adjust sensors to stop false alarming. Finally added a rubber o ring as a sensor spacer, improved some;added a second o ring spacer;improved a little more but still false alarmed constantly after vehicle sat in sun for a while. Rubber o rings made the sensors stick out and overall looked like crap! Drill burned up when using in metal bumper. Had to buy a new 22mm bimetal drill bit. System might be o.k. for plastic bumpers. Don't try to use it in a metal bumper!!!"
5,Excellent product,"This is as easy as kissing hands. All you need is a drill and some tape (to insulate the connection the reverse lights). The drill bit is exact and sharp. All the sensors are numbered. You cannot make a mistake. Works prefectly everytime - 12"" space after the 0.0 indication on the display."
4,Great CD,I'm a huge Stone Temple Pilots fan and this is an outstanding CD. Plenty of great songs. Thanks for a wonderful disc.
2,It just didn't work.,"In short, this album was a letdown to me. The first two albums were so strong, and then this. Now it's not bad, and I appreciate the attempt to head in another musical direction, but overall it's just blah. ""Big Bang Baby"" I do like , and a few other tracks do please, but even the two other singles I don't care for. To me it boils down to a dumb album title, bad artwork, and even the cd itself looks like a beachball? Again, it's not terrible, but I'd think twice before you ""Press Play"". At least the 4th album was better."
3,What Is This?,What happened? STP was so good in those first 2 albums and then they come and blow it with their worst one. I'm and STP fan but i just dont like this CD. Theres like 2 good songs. Thats about it. the rest isn't very good. STP can do better than this
2,WHO IS THAT SINGING?,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE POUNDING INTENSE VOICE OF SCOTT WEILAND ON THIS CD? IT DOESNT EVEN SOUND LIKE SOMETHING STP WOULD MAKE! ITS NOT DOWNRIGHT HORRIBLE BUT CLOSE TO IT. LISTEN TO THEIR OTHERS INCLUDND NO.4 THE NEW ONE ....SCOTTS VOICE IS BACK AND IT ROCKS! BUT THIS CD DOESNT!
1,Worst STP Album - By far,"Wow - No wonder I never rounded out my STP collection with this album.It is by far the worst album of their catalog. Scott Weiland was really struggling on this recording, his vocals are strained and lifeless. The song writing is poor as well. Better off skipping this one."
2,diappointment,"this album is certainly a disappointing follow-up to purple. i could only find 2 decent tracks on it (seven caged tigers, trippin on a hole...) i think bands should change their sound often, but this album doesn't cut the grade."
3,"A change, but still good.","Stone Temple Piolots remain true to thier music. As they did with the two previous albums, they explored through a different method of making music. I don't enjoy listening to this CD as much as I do the first two albums, but this album is still worth owning. Good songs are Lady Picture Show and Trippin' On A Hole In A Paper Heart."
3,Confused about their musical direction,"With Tiny Music, with the exception of Trippin on a Hole, STP have moved away from grunge. They seem to be experimenting with many different musical styles, Unfortunately this causes Tiny Music to be a somewhat disjointed product and the album doesn't really gel as a whole."
2,Very disappointing!!!!!,As a big fan of STP I was very disappointed when I heard this CD. It is very different from their other two GREAT CDs. I hope their new album is better.
4,One of the best song by STP,"Trippin' On A Hole In A Paper Heart is one of the best songs by STP, the rest of the Cd is great. I waited a long time to purchase this one but kept remembering hearing some of it tripping songs. It is different but a must have!!!!"
4,Stone Temple Pilots most brilliant album.,"This album is amazing, the way the guitar riffs and singing gel together is just brilliant, and then those are thrown in with those brilliant catchy parts and melodies of ""Big Bang Baby"" ""Trippin on a hole in a paper heart"" ""Lady Picture Show"" ""Tumble In The Rough"" and ""Pops Love Suicide"".Its a far more enjoyable and more tuneful listen than ""Core"" and the songs are better than ""Purple"".Although its not their best album as a whole, it does contains the Stone Temple Pilots best songs and some of the most amazing songs ever performed."
2,I just can't get used to it.,"I got this CD at the same time as I got No 4. Being a fan of Core and Purple, I was really hoping for more of the same. After reading the reviews, I thought there would be some songs here that would grab me, but alas, there are not. I guess Track 1, Press Play, Track 6, And So I Know, and Track 7, Trippin' On a Hole in a Paper Heart, would keep me from throwing it out, but otherwise, this CD is not going to see a lot of time on my CD player. No 4 (the CD) is much more what I would have expected and I thoroughly love that one."
4,Not what you'd expect,"Not what you'd expect to hear from one of the pillars of grunge, but a great departure nonetheless. Granted some of the songs do get old after a number of listenings, unlike the other albums, but still a great cd and an excellent change of pace. I have to give the band credit for taking a drastic change in their sound whereas other bands (Foo Fighters) keep putting out the same song over and over. The last track, Seven Caged Tigers, is the best song that STP has ever made and one of my all-time favorites."
3,Depends on how you look at it.,"This is a good CD. The songs are catchy and it's far removed from ""Core"" musically. It's good that artists take chances and try different things. It's just that, for me, the songs are too pop sounding and a little on the light side. Not neccessarily a bad thing, just not what I'm looking for from this group."
4,worth picking up,"If your a hardcore STP fan, this album is worthy of picking up. A lot of people overlook this album, but trust me, it's good, especially the floaty song ""And So I Know"", ""Tripin on a Daisy in a Paper Heart, (Sounds like something off of Core), Lady Picture Show"" and the list goes on and on. You really have to listen to the whole cd to really appreciate it. Although it's not as good as Core, this album still rocks. Actually I give it a 4 and a half."
4,Overlooked by the narrow minded,"This is the STP cd that I respect most. It is much more innovative than anything else that they have done. The jazz instrumentals are beautiful, and they create some great ballads with ""Lady Picture Show"" and ""Adhesive"". This is really some great stuff. It is generally softer, there is less rocking, and more singing. It does supply some hard rock songs, but not too many. Not like that's bad or anything, but just a awarning to those that think anything soft is boring. The only problem is that the tracks seem kind of jumbled together. It doesn't ""flow"". However, I will still reccommend this to any music fan."
2,"They were right,","all those folks who told me to forget this CD, that it wasn't worth listening to. I finally listened to this CD today, after being a big fan of the band and owning ""core"", ""purple"", and ""No. 4"". Now I KNOW I wasn't missing anything in not having heard 'Tiny Music'. This album doesn't rock at all. The band seems to be going through the motions of rocking, but with no feeling backing up their performance. This is to me the musical equivalent of when AMF owned Harley-Davidson. Dark days, indeed."
1,Make It Stop!,"Oh, its so bad! Please make it stop.I've been an STP fan from the beginning - I bought the first album when it came out because I liked the name of the band. And it turned out to be a great album, as was their second (in my mind, their masterpiece). But this, their third, is a mess. I've never been quite sure what they were trying to accomplish on this album but I find it amazing that this group of musicians all thought releasing this was somehow a good idea.STP was accused of being a Pearl Jam sound-alike when Plush first hit the scene. And since then they've followed Pearl Jam in one important way - they've branched out, tried different things and mixed up their sound. No two albums sound alike. They're constantly progressing. Unfortunately with this one though, they went off the deep end.Please resist the urge to follow the advice of the first track - don't push play."
2,One major hit and that's it,This album has them best STP song ever. Paper heart is in my opinion the best song this awesome band has ever created. Unfortunatly i can't say that about the rest of the cd. Lack luster album i'm afraid.
3,The guitar as a weapon,"This was the first STP cd that I really got a chance to listen to. While not exceeding my expectations, it did not perform poorly at all. Many of the tracks are simply a fast chord progression with distortion, and the STPs do it very well, if you into that kind of thing. There are some songs, however, that definitely show good writing and inginuity. After listining to it, you come away with the feeling that the Stone Temple Pilots are trying to get a more refined tone, but sometimes simply go ahead and hit the distortion pedal and play fast. It is, overall, a good album, but not recommended for anyone who dislikes simple guitar noise and feedback."
4,Exploring the pop-inspired side of STP,"Even though this album is more pop-influenced, there are still plenty of heavy guitars and rocking songs.""Does anybody know how the story really goes? Or do we all just hum along?"", asks ""Big Bang Baby"", one of the highlights of the album. It is a grunge song with a pop rock chorus.""Trippin On A Hole In A Paper Heart"" is one of their best songs, with one of the most memorable choruses in their repertoire.Other highlights include, ""Pop's Love Suicide"", a fast-paced rocker, ""Tumble In the Rough"", a really moody song, ""Lady Picture Show"", an oldschool Beatles-like rock ballad, and the fun ""Art School Girl"".This is not the best STP album, as I prefer the earlier stuff, but it is a very good album and shows another side to this great band."
5,Another fine release from STP,"STP was one of the most important grunge metal bands of the early 1990's. They mixed Led Zeppelin style hard rock with the alternative acts of the era. Although creating a quite bizarre musical landscape for the 90's, they could play high-quality rock n roll. And on this one, they do the same. Big Bang Baby, one of the album's standout tracks, was a Top 40 hit for the band in 1996. Essential for a 90's rock fan or even a metalhead."
4,STP- Tiny Music..Sons From The Vatican Gift Shop,"I am a huge Stone Temple Pilots. I know all of their music back to front. This album has some good music on it, Pop loves Suicide, and Trippin on a hole in a Paper Heart are my two favorites! It does have a few good ballads. All in all though, I thought that it shows how talented they really are! That they can do more than what a lot of critcs said or thought they would! So , my advice is to run out and buy any cd by Stone Temple Pilots, its well worth the money, and you'll be hooked for life!!"
4,FOR ANY DIE-HARD STP FAN!,"Okay...for all of you die-hard STP fans out there, this CD deserves to be given a shot. Sure, you may think ""I only like 'Big Bang Baby'"", but 'Tiny Music' will change your mind. Any true STP fan knows that the band gives out it's own unique energy and view on life, love, and the world. 'Tiny Music' is just another addition to the great insight. Scott Weiland & Co. have had better works, such as 'Purple' and 'Core', right up to their newest, 'No. 4', but this work deserves just as much recognition. No one rocks with a grunge/glam/unique appeal like STP!!!"
4,just one song,"just check out the last song on the record -seven caged tigers- and you'll know why you have to buy it, although its not the pilots best album...."
3,It's almost great,"First of all, I respect STP for their artistic integrity for trying to break free of the mold. They try alot of interesting things on this album and incorporate lots of musical styles almost seamlessly. Unfortunatly, that almost ruins the whole thing. Some songs, like Adheasive, and the radio single Tripping on a Hole... work great. Some don't. On the whole, the album is disjointed and doesn't seem to work. I do, however, think this album is worth buying just to check out the new direction STP is going in."
2,"Two decent tracks, the rest blow","It's no wonder that STP broke up after this album. I have a lot of respect for the past guitar work of Dean DeLeo, and Scott Weiland can be a compelling vocalist at times. But this album is mostly garbage. The opening track ""Press Play"" is a promising, instrumental diddy but the second, third and fourth tracks disappoint. With the exception of ""Lady Picture Show"" and ""Adhesive,"" so do the rest. I get the sense that STP is struggling to find a musical identity; they're all over the musical map with this album, but unfortunately they remain lost."
2,Completely Compatable with hp5040us. Did Not Last,"This adapter worked perfectly with my HP Pavilion dv5040us. Adapter is not HP brand, but that is apparent in the description. After a few months of moderate use, the cord that carries power to the laptop, shorted, i replaced the cord but the adapter itself was fried."
5,Full of Ideas,"This is a great resource book for early childhood nature studies. Great for family or school use. It lists activites and books for many nature topics. The cycle of the day, endagered species, protecting the environemnt and more are all covered with books and activites for ages 3 and up. (probably to about 3rd grade)"
1,BURNS YOUR CARPET,"This vacuum is only three months old when I tried to vacume up a small area of dirt in the middle of my living room. What I saw as the vacuum passed over the area is a brown streak. I didn't know what it was at first. It wouldn't clean up even with detergent and hand scrubbing. I called a carpet cleaning company in and they said it was a burn! I then took the vacuum to service and they said the motor over-heated (BURNING MY CARPET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LIVING ROOM!!). I now have to get the carpet replaced. This vacuum apparently has the same over-heating flaw that the closely related Hoover model ""U5150-900 Tempo Upright Bagless Vacuum"" has. Check out the Amazon reviews of that one. I will never buy a Hoover product again!!"
3,Decent dog house but the large really isnt for large dogs,Bought this for my rotty and she can barely fit in. Shes weights about 100lb and gets in but looks uncomfortable.
3,Balanced approach to the subject of angels,"Cheryl Salem records many instances of angelic appearances that took place in her life, as well as in the life of her family. Some very amazing stuff, especially in the life of her daughter. Angels ministered to her on numerous occasions. She describes some very touching accounts. Much of the book is dedicated to having a balanced biblical approach to the subject of angels. However, the concordance containing most references of angelic appearances in the Bible seems unnecessary, almost like filler. The bottom line to me was that though the book at times was very moving and informative, it was not faith building and I did not keep it in my library."
5,How to play the drums with brushes? This is a MUST!,"Not only is Clayton Cameron a nice guy, when it comes to play the drums with brushes I can say he is thé absolute number one in the world, and I am proffessionally working in the music business for over 25 years, and was blessed to work with musicians and singers from over 17 countries worldwide. If you want to know everything about how to play the drums with brushes, order this Video or the DVD NOW."
2,Not worth even this price. BOORING,Get the VHI Behind the Music. This is poor. Sound is thin and tinny. I bought it due to the low price but probaly will never listen again.
5,I Bought 2,"I use this pan for lasagne, enchiladas and bean casseroles. It is a top quality pan. Don't let the price fool you, as this is comparable to Le Creuset in construction and quality. I have purchased an additional one for a gift."
1,Pure junk and a rip off!,"DO NOT GET THIS GAME. Compared to Adventures in Time, this game is a major letdown with boring gameplay and way to easy levels. Go get Adventures in Time or All stars if you want some yellow guy fun. (Amazon has them both)."
2,Not as good as I thought it was before...,"When little SMB Madman played Ms. Pac-Man: Quest for the Golden Maze, I pretty much thought ""Hey, another Pac-Man game!"" I just thought it would play like old arcade-style Ms. Pac-Man. Fortunately, that's what I got, but UNfortunately, that's ALL I got. I didn't care, but looking at it now....It seemed like it was following behind Pac-Man: Adventures in Time, but unlike that game, this game isn't so great. The environments are all the same dull pyramid-like look. The mazes aren't any more intriguing than the bonus mazes you get to find in the Pac-Man World games. To top it all off, the music is just plain repetitive, and the one tune (So I remember) plays throughout the game.It's nice to see that there's a 2-Player mode, but that's one of the few good things it has to offer. If you can tolerate the blandness of the game, then I GUESS you can notice that it still is classic Pac-Man.......Classic Pac-Man that's hampered by all this junk."
4,Chase me Around,"This is a fun game and a nerve-wracking one also trying to eat the dots and stay healthy yourself. This is a game for helping the time to go by and change your stress factor from bummed out to wild and wooly flat out. Also, you can get your dexterity improved and your eyes uncrossed (maybe).It is fast and furious but exciting and I love to try and beat my wife at it but I have to do it when she is not looking or I get heckled."
2,Not like the arcade game,I have been looking for a PC version of the game that plays like the arcade version. My search continues.
4,Lots of Fun,I have windows xp with 512 ram and it runs no problems.Only wish it came with the original Ms pac-man to. But have had lots of fun playing this one.
3,What a let down after Pac Man Adventures in Time,"Pac fans will get only a short fix from this one. Conquering this game was TOO easy...and everything that made Pac Man Adventures in Time amazing is missing. Little thought seemed to be put into making this a visually vivid game that gave a new twist to Ms. Pac. There are no incredible worlds to travel to. All the mazes look basically the same. There are some new features, like special power ups and bonus mazes, but the challenge and excitement is just not there. Not to mention that I got very used to the ""jump"" capabalility of Pac Man in Adventures in Time...Ms. Pac Man doesn't have that capability. Infogrames really copped out on this one...especially considering what an incredible job they did with the first game. Total disappointment. Try Dig Dug Deeper instead. Much more entertaining."
1,Disappointed,I got this game for a good price but when I tryed to play it on my PC it crashed my system I had to Restore my whole system because of that game on a scale of 1 to 5 I have to give it a 0 don't buy this game unless you won't to crash your system I was so upset I throw the game away I have got other items from amazon.com and never had problem until now so from now on I will pay full price for things on the amazon.com website it's not worth it to me to crash & restore my PC over&over again. signed Disappointed member.
1,Buyer Beware!,What a scam!!! The description was VERY misleading and from what I understand I can't return it. It wasn't even in a sealed package...and where is the sinjgle player option? I will never order from them again. I can't believe amazon lets them sell on their site.
1,Not the Ms. Pac Man I remember,"This is not the Ms. Pac Man we played in the 80's ! You would think that with the power of a 600 MHz Pentium III, this program would respond to commands quickly and be at least somewhat legible. I can't make out the walls or the escape routes, and the only decent way to run it is with the arrow keys on the keyboard."
3,It works on XP !,I have windows XP and even though it says 95/98/me on the package it works on Windows XP just fine. I play it all the time.
1,Horrible disappointment after Pac-Man Adventures in Time,"There are seven levels, each containing about 4 mazes, and the last level only has 1 maze, which is 25 mazes and a huge let down after Pac-Man Adventures in Time has like 50 mazes. The graphics are also really bad compared to the last game. You think, ""A sequel! It's probably twice as good!"" but that's not the case. I would not buy again if I had to."
2,"Okay, but not as challenging as I thought","I have always been an avid fan of Ms. Pac Man, and purchased this game, thinking it may have been similiar to Ms. Pac Man Maze Madness. The game is okay, but not very challenging. It only has six levels and even at the most difficult level, can be completed quite easily."
3,A bit ticked...,"I really love the band the Tea Party. This DVD is a great idea. One problem... I have a playstation 2 as my main DVD player and it does not play this disc. There is a warning on it that says it may not play in some consoles, but when my girlfriend bought it for me for xmas, I don't think it said that anywhere on Amazon's website.So anyway. I don't know if the disc skips based on the fact it's not made to play on game consoles, or because it is scratched... but I'm bummed.I just want to say that you should still get this DVD but beware if you have a PS2."
3,not up to par,"Richard Elliot's recent Ballads is a very pleasant disc to listen to. However, when I listen to an Elliot I'm expecting something more than just ""pleasant"". I expect excitement. This certainly is not a bad disc, just not up to the usual par expected from this artist."
4,Hopper as Director and Actor Extraordinaire,"As a true low-budget independent work, this film delivers more art and honesty than most indie films before and after. The film opens with Dennis Hopper drunkenly driving his big rig with his daughter in clown make-up and asking her if he is sexier than Elvis. Then he crashes into a busload of screaming children, destroying the lives of the children, his daughter and himself. The film follows the wake of this incident and the black clouds that follow he and his daughter. She grows up to be an bitter, lost tomboy obsessed with punk rock and Elvis. The soundtrack of country, punk, Elvis and the Neil Young song ""My My, Hey Hey"" sum up the attitude and art of the film nicely. Its hopeless, realistic, rural and almost surreal in its human tragedy. A remarkable small film and expertly directed by Hopper. Perhaps not a masterpiece, but a true classic."
3,Out of the Blue,Too much foul language. Didn't care for it much. Raymond Burr's part was good but too little. Wouldn't recommend unless your into movies about the drug scene and disfunctional families.
4,"Not their best, but still great","In 1992, the Queers released LOVE SONGS FOR THE RETARDED, their best album and one of the top 5 punk rock albums ever. Next they released BEAT OFF, which was almost as good. Then, in 1995, they release this album, MOVE BACK HOME. Unfortunately, MOVE BACK HOME doesn't come close to approaching the punk goodness of the prior 2 albums. The songs just don't pack the same punch, and aren't as memorable. Joe Queer himself said he thought this album was just mediocre.But just because this album isn't as good as the prior 2 Queers albums, does that make it not worth buying? HECK NO! Joe Queer is a pop-punk genius, and even his lesser songs are a joy to listen to. I'd take any song on MOVE BACK HOME over any song from many other punk bands. Plus, the album has been remastered, and sounds ten times better than it did before. Finally, it includes the 4-song Surf Goddess EP."
5,The Diva of the Diva's,"Elaine always take our breath out of compass, always. Her version to I dreamed a dream is astonishing! We all know that she is the best singing actress in the whole world, and once again on this CD she is proving we can trust her... She never failed. She is the real Queen!!! This CD can show to anyone the power of her voice!"
1,same model but not the same specs!,"Bought these together to have a matching pair in the car. But they are different eventhough they have the same model number. First, the setup, one says color then the other one doesn't. One has satueation the other one doesn't. Second, one is in normal viewing mode the other one is zoomed and there is no option to unzoom. 3rd, tech connected it to controlled acc but everytime I turn on the car one is on too evenif I left them both off. And last, whatever I do they can't have the same color one is bright abd the other one seems to be ok. Probably one or both is/ are refurbished!"
5,Quality!,"Very satisfied, this Jacket is as advertised, well made, no loose threads, stitching or other flaws, fits well in all dimensions, warm, comfortable, tough."
3,IT IS NOT WATER PROOF!!! I,Ok this is a decent coat. I called Carhart when my husband told me he was soaking wet.. Wait this is supposed to be water proof. No it says water repellent. If you live in the Pacific Northwest or a place where it rains all day and your out in the elements rain/snow nope this coat is not for you. There is not a coat out by Carhart yet.So water proof no water repellent yes (this means a half an hour of rain it will be water resistant)Hope this helps
5,Great jacket,This thing is built to last. It's very warm and will do the job in any climate. Like others have said it is very stiff and will take some time to wear in.
2,"Husky fit, too stiff","This is a ""husky"" man's jacket. I ordered tall because I have long arms, but I don't have a gut. A winter jacket that has a huge paunchy bottom hem like this lets the wind blow up it and makes me cold, thus defeating the purpose. So unless you have a beer belly or are He Man then you probably want a different jacket. Also its super stiff, and you can't move without resistance in the sleeves which is tiring and annoying. Also, the zipper could use some lubrication or something, because its not really wanting to zip up very easily. Otherwise, this jacket would be nice."
2,buyer beware,"I just returned this jacket because it was incredibly stiff. It is so stiff that the jackets hood will stand up on it's own! I was very disappointed. In general Carhartt does make wonderful work clothes, but with this arctic jacket they need to go back to the drawing board. Go with the quilted flannel lined jacket, it's still warm and doesn't feel like you're wearing a diving board."
4,Ever Body Looks Good in Overhauls,"Now if you ask me, and plenty of folk do who are in need of both durability and comfort in a workable, fashionable statement in their wardrobe... these here overhauls are the way to go. Not only are they practical work clothes - they clean up nice and can be worn out on the town when need arises. Plus that, this particular make comes in triple X Large and that, my friends, is almost big enough for Mama to slide in to a pair here real soon., See she's been on the Atkins Diet for a few months and she already dropped about 86 pounds but she's got a couple hundred to go before she's back down to her old fighting weight and can get in to these uni-sex universal timeless classic overhauls. Possum Belly overhauls are the best, but you can't really find them on the internet unless you get real lucky and are willing to buy imports... which I ain't."
4,easy to read instructions,I am new to machine quilting and purchased this book as I need some ideas how to go about it. This book contains lots of good ideas and tips
5,Mastering the Art of McTavishing,The book arrived in a timely fashion and in perfect condition. The information within the book was well written and illustrated. I couldn't have asked for more.
1,MCTAVISHING DISAPPOINTMENT,I DID NOT FIND ANYTHING NEW OR INTERESTING IN THIS ART CALLED 'MCTIVISHING' SO I HAD TO RETURN THIS DISAPPOINTING BOOK TO ANAZON.
3,McTavishing...A great instruction manual,"I am trying to expand my knowledge of free motion quilting and found this book to be exceptional. It gave me the ""tools"" I needed to jump in and go a new direction with free motion quilting.Mastering the Art of McTavishing"
3,Self Confidence,"Read the reviews and bit disappointed, listening for just over a week, so will keep trying. Very slow talking and I find myself falling asleep. Have not really noticed change in my confidence."
5,Love it!,"I've fallen head over heels for Glenn Harrold products. I love his products, although some are better than others, this one I truly enjoy. I relax, feel better and wake up happy. The CD takes you on a fun relaxing journey of imagery while he speaks hypnotic messages. It's a really fun item to own. I listen to at least one of CD's daily. What a treat they are."
1,Develop Your Self Confidence (Diviniti),"I was really dissapointed. I have a couple of belleruth naparstek cd's that I've listened to for the last few years, and was looking for something new. This CD had about 3% of the content and effort put into it as the Belleruth Naparstek Self Confidence. I just tossed it because it's not even worth my time."
1,"With Friends Like Alan, Who Needs Enemies?","Self-indulgent prose about a self-involved man's self-pitying and self-important journey halfway around the world to assert himself and his culture on other people. I'm not qualified to comment on his zoological practices, but I don't come away impressed with him. His writing is C level work -- simply wretched. It does have the quality of being revealing, but not necessarily of the point he labors and fails to make. This book is a depressing first-person account of cultural imperialism. No wonder Americans are so universally reviled in other countries..."
3,you gotta be a big fan!,"A very talented girl on show here, but this Dvd doesnt get played much, probably because my huge collection of dvds from around the globe...the layout seems a bit hit a miss...BUT if you like Toni then its good value..."
4,Toni is cool here,I Like more of Her Dance Material&stuff from her Earlier Albums.it's Hit&Miss.but the Added Bonus is the Fine Aspect of Her.TOni is Never Badd for the Eyes.I think She has a Good Voice but the Slow Stuff since Her 2nd Album is too Predictable to Me.I'd Like to Hear Her do More Dance Stuff I think She has a Donna Summer run in Her.She has Versatility in Her WOrk but things don't always get Showcased Properly to Me.this is a Cool Set.
3,3 1/2 STARS!! Good...,"But I did expect a little bit more. This DVD has just about EVERY video done by this lovely Diva. Remember all the different hairstyles she was famous for? This DVD shows the clever and artsy style that was put forth in all these videos.Although there is some commentary from Toni herself, I did expect to see some behind the scenes footage and possibly some comments from a few of her famous friends and family.All in all, this CD is a good addition to your musical DVD collection."
3,I love Toni but.....,"This was a compilation of videos which were okay. However, I was expecting a concert performance. I was a bit disappointed with the quality as well. Probably won't look at it again. I will continue to search for a Toni Braxton concert on DVD."
4,Great DVD,"This is the most complete DVD video collection I have ever seen. it has more than enough for her fans to delve into. However, the only complaint I have is that her ""live"" performances in the ""Extras"" section are not live. If you listen to the audio, it's a pre-recorded performance. It shows her on stage with a microphone, but the audio is not live. Other than that, I highly praise Toni for this release. She has released two albums since this DVD came out, so hopefully there will be more DVD material to come."
5,best DVD,"I've been fans Toni's since she came, I have her 4 cds Toni Braxton, Secret, Heat and More than woman and her DVD with love Toni and her song are beautiful and love I like Spanish Guitar, Flow and he mean wolrd me.I love her is pretty"
1,stale but flavorful,"The product date was ok [just by a couple of weeks!] but the product was stale. The flavor was so good though that you ate some even though it was soft. If fresh, this product would be FANTASTIC."
2,Not Dependable,My wife purchase this unit as part of a surround sound system. Only worked about 6-7 times before it wouldn't come on. The unit has may features but if it doesn't work not worth anything. I will be looking for another brand of player. Will not purchase a replacement of the same brand and model.
5,This book reads like gentle hills and dales -,"It's an amazing read - with knowledge abounding, but it is not force fed - truly wonderful lyrical writing about the everyday art of lyric poetry -(I borrowed this copy from a friend) - There is another review on my Amazon page, where I had ordered it from a private seller here on Amazon,and he totally scammed - never received it, he never answered emails, etc. I was actually offended about the way he mis-treated the Author's work - it was a personal affront -Diane Thiel is AWESOME in imparting information - and when I make up that hard earned cash lost, I will seek this out and buy it proudly and lovingly -If you have a yen for the lyrical at all, (or aren't sure) - this book will lead you for real down a delightful path!"
2,"Sizing is whacky, not intelligent.","I am a 36-38"" waist, depending on diet and how much gear I have. I bought a large initially, which I could have used to tie down building materials on my car after leaving home depot. It would fit a massive person, and in fact, the velcro wouldn't ""mate"" for someone my size. So I bought the medium (in black, again), and this time, I had about 2-4"" of belt remaining after running it through the clasp. I wouldn't be confident tying off this rigger belt for rappelling, safety line, etc...They really need to make another size (XL) for these belts. The large would fit the biggest person you know... like 300-400 pounders."
5,What I needed,Easy to put on and off. Worth the price. Seems resistant and of good quality. Just what I needed. Arrived on time.
2,Size is way too small,"I'm not sure how the belt works because it was incredibly small. I have a size 35 waist, measured by actual tape measure at the skin. I ordered a size 34 belt because all of my mil-issue rigger's belts are size 34 and I have to cut off material. This belt was only 32 inches long.The point of a riggers belt is to feed it through the buckle and velcro several inches back on itself. This makes a strong enough hold that you can be extracted by helicopter with it. This belt would maybe fit someone with a size 28 waist as I couldn't even get one end to touch the other.I've usually had better luck with Blackhawk gear than the standard mil-issue, but in this case the mil-issue far exceeded the Blackhawk gear."
2,Difficult Ordering Procedure,How do you have any idea how much you're going to pay. The site ad says the price depends on the options on the left. My screen has no options on the left. I tried three or four times to order this belt and just gave up. It's the stupidest thing I've seen yet as far as ordering methods.
1,Never recieved product,"I ordered this while deployed, tried to ship it to an APO. The order went through and a week later i was informed that the item would not ship to an APO. Just a heads up to anyone else that is deployed incase you try to order this."
2,"Bulky, big, and scratchy","I'm sure there is a place for this belt, but daily casual wear was not it for us. The buckle protruded, the seams scratched and snagged, and the hardware looked hugely out of place. The belt now lives in our automobile safety kit."
1,Rigger belt was shipped without the extra thick heavy duty plastic case,"If you order the rigger belt from this company don't expect to get the thick heavy duty plastic case that zip closes at the top. I specifically wanted this extra strong heavy duty plastic case that normally comes with the rigger belt, to store some of my other gear. If you order from somewhere else, you will get the extra heavy duty plastic case. Just wanted everyone to know you will not be getting the extra heavy duty plastic case if you order your rigger belt here."
4,CQB OD green belt,"the product was awesome and it is great, however the sizing isn't what I expected. I ordered a size 41 and it wasn't that size even though it was labeled the size I ordered. Like I said the product is fantastic and the service was really good."
5,BlackHawk CQB/Riggers's Belt,This product was bought for my son who is in the A.N.G. He picked this out because he wears it with his uniform. These are great for that purpose or any other reason a person might need a belt.
3,Blackhawk Riggers Belt,Belt is stiff Webbing. I purchased it primarily for holster and pistol. Works well for this and doesn't sag. The metal is heavy and I intend to remove the triangle since I won't be needing it. Happy with purchase.
3,Sizing was wrong for me,"I am a 36""-38"" waist. The medium was to small. I would advise anyone in this range or higher to go for the large."
5,"Great women's belt, watch the sizing tho","I really like this belt. I will say I could have gotten a small and been just fine. I wear an 8-10 in women's pants, so for all you ladies out there, I would tell you go on the smaller side. I had a much more simple web type belt before hand to wear under my duty belt and it jus wasn't rigid enough, this belt gets the job done without being stiff or uncomfortable. Several of us at work now wear them."
3,The buckle and attachment point are too close together,"The buckle and attachment point are too close together it needs to move about another inch down the belt, and the velcro could be sturdier, otherwise it is as advertised."
5,Blackhawk CQB/ Rigger's Belt,used in industral type work for high places. The belt has a place to tie in to with safety ropes and hooks to stop falls.
3,"Great belt, but too small","I ordered a small according to the sizing chart. According to the chart it seemed as if the belt should have been to big. When it arrived, it won't even fit around my waist. I'm sending it back and getting a much bigger size. BEWARE when you order to get a bigger size than it tells you!"
4,Awesome Belt!,"Great casual and/ tactical belt. Unfortunately it was too large for me.The end of the belt terminated half way around my back? I'm a 34-36waist. Returned for the Med size, and it fits fine now. Blackhawk shouldredo the belt sizes, otherwise it's a great product."
5,awesome,"This belt is a handsome but rugged looking, and is well made.I enjoy the fit and look of this belt.I even bought a Desert Tan one also."
4,"Excellent belt, but sizes run really small.",Great quality belt. Overall satisfied with product. Although wish sizes were more specified. If you are a small consider getting a medium and so forth. Delivery was right on time.
4,Great Belt!,Overall this is a great belt. Fits my tactical pants perfect. I'm not sure if I like the velcro part but maybe I'll get used to it.
5,Great (but there's an color and size error),"The belt is great, ...but theres a problem with the ""description"".I asked for a ""Brown"" Belt, and because of some ""miscommunication"", they send me a ""Brown (-DESSERT-)"" Belt.Also I asked for a bigger size, and it was the right fit."
3,It can rust...but works,"I bought it for sheep hunting, and use it to rappel down short cliff faces...or to tie a simple safety line to walk down steep inclinesIt works fine, a professional rock climbing guide showed me how to use it properly and we tested it..ok on the useIt has some rust on the buckle after a season....i expected it to be more resistant"
2,Toy Did Not Work Well,"My daughters love the Wiggles, and have many of their toys. They have all the dolls, the guitar, the cars, etc., etc. Unfortunately the microphone was a real dissappointment. It really didn't work well from the moment they received it as a gift. We changed the batteries several times, but that didn't help. The only way we could get it to work was to bang it on the floor really hard. That would allow us to play a few songs. My girls enjoyed the toy when it actually worked. They still use the microphone even thought music does not come out of it. Just thought I would give other Wiggles fans a heads up."
1,Have earplugs ready....,"Just received this new toy today. It has low/medium/high volume switch, comes with two AA batteries and there's a try me/on switch. Flipped it over to on, pushed Anthony so he'd start singing and then pushed the microphone button in the center of the toy. There was an ear piercing feedback coming from the microphone that made the dog run for cover and our daughter screamed and ran into her bedroom! The only way it could be played with was without using the microphone, which sure wasn't worth the $$. Very disappointing considering it is a Wiggles brand name toy. ... I suggest buying the guitar instead."
1,terrible sound,"My 2 year old daughter loves the Wiggles and we've enjoyed some of the other Wiggles toys. (the guitar and the car) This microphone, however, is TERRIBLE and has a loud static noise so you can't even hear the tunes it's supposed to be playing. The only functionality is the mode where it works like a microphone for the child. This was a waste of money."
4,Superb small coffee table book,"A beautiful picture book with poems, quips and verses from the book of Job. Great for a coffee table. Incredible photography. 72 pages."
1,Actually ZERO stars,"In addition to the incredible slowness on the handheld, the accuracy is awful. It is not just the handheld version. The laptop version suffers the same bugs. The maps are simply not calibrated right. It was often as much as 1,000 feet off. This is not only suboptimal, it's outright dangerous because it keeps distracting you by telling you that you're off-route.The only good thing about this junk is the return policy. DeLorme has a 30 day no questions asked guarantee. Of course, you're still out the tax and the cost of shipping it back.Avoid it like the plague."
1,ZERO STARS !!!!!!!!,"I use the desktop software and have been content with it. I find STreet Atlas easier to use but INACCURATE and MS Streets and Trips to be MORE accurate but less intuitive.Street Atlas for Handheld is a complete, unfinished, unpolished, inaccurate and VERY unintuitive waste of money!Basically, the reviews previous to mine have said it all. I would recommend Tom Tom Navigator for Handhelds or Microsoft's Streets and Trips for PocketPC."
1,Flush your money down the toilet!,"At least you'll get to see it swirl around before it disappears. Then you can walk away and forget it instead of wasting HOURS AND HOURS in frustration after you've wasted the money.I bought this program because I thought it would be more current on the local streets than my old GPS software that came out in 2003 - WRONG! Less current, and not nearly as user friendly or anything else you want street GPS for.The other reviews do a good job of telling you some of the weaknesses. I just wish I had read them before I bought this trash.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS IF YOU ARE THINKING OF USING IT WITH A HANDHELD DEVICE!!!"
1,Not for the recerational user,Does not automatically recalculate your route should you get off course. Maps are cumbersome pick out and to load. There are far better packages on the market.
1,Get the desktop version,"I love Street Atlas on my laptop, so I decided to try to miniturize it and stick it on my handheld...bad decision. The handheld software is horrible. Nothing like the desktop/laptop version. The user interface is horrible and the software lags constantly on my Axim X3i (400 mHz X-Scale and it lags). There are much better handheld navigation software titles out there, especially TomTom Navigator (in my opinion the best handheld navigation program out there). Street Atlas is a waste and I cannot recommend it to anybody."
2,"Nice Pictures, No Other Substance","the book was in great shape, but I was disappointed that there wasn't more design/construction information. If you're looking for pictures to get ideas it is nice."
2,Disappointed...,"I really enjoyed Ms. Curry's Easy Homeschooling book, so checked this book out, hoping for more of the same. Instead, I found it full of fear tactics and someone who refuses to use technology to educate, instead only insisting to avoid books written after the 1950's, far out stories that were hard to even understand what she was talking about (it is not legal to lock people in nursing homes against their own will and their children's will unless there was a crime or they were dangerous). I love old books and found some great tips in this book, but had to wade through a lot of fear mongering to get there."
1,Very disappointed,"I am by no means an atheist, but I was looking for solid information on homeschooling. I hold two master's degrees myself, one in education, and I found this book to be of NO value. I wanted solid information on homeschooling, and instead, I got preached to.Also, the author makes wild claims that lack documentation. Some of the claims alluded to have no citations, and others are just wild speculation. If you are looking for good home school advice, this is not the book for you unless you enjoy wading through pages of preaching to find it."
3,It made me uneasy,"I felt as though I was missing something all the way through the book. Maybe we have become insensitive, but I felt as though they were running from some horrific murder, when really it was a car accident. I know drugs were involved, but I felt the daughter must have been aware of the drug use and put herself in that situation. Also, as a person in my early thirties, I didn't understand the paranoia they felt. I was really disappointed in the end when she slept with a man, it was totally uncharacteristic for her."
3,Just OK undies.,"I have been looking for high waisted thongs for awhile now, and when I saw these I thought I had struck pay dirt. I ordered 2 pairs of these undies thinking that they would be something special. With shipping I paid almost $25 for 2 pair of underwear, which I think is rather pricey. They are nothing special. I like them, but I can get the same thing locally for A LOT less. I would not by them again."
4,Pretty tasty - and don't dis Bob!,"This was such a Tarentino-esque flick that I wasn't surprised at the outstanding use of new covers of oldies. This sound track re-creates the atmosphere of the movie every time I hear it, which is what a soundtrack is supposed to do. And as for the Dylan cover of Ring of Fire, he's always been out there on the edge, and it isn't always easy to listen to him. But it's almost always worthwhile."
5,Hard to find soundtrack...,"If it wasn't for a chance viewing of the movie one night on cable I never would have heard this soundtrack. Even the bizzarre Bob Dylan cover of Johnny Cash's country hit ""Ring of Fire"" was so far out there I actually liked it. Music like on this CD makes you want to smash your radio and never waste time on the formula junk music again."
5,Fun toy,My daughter has gone outside & made snow bricks & built a snow fort since getting this for Christmas. It works great! Fort is still standing after about 4 days.
4,Product is as described.,Product is fine. Flexible Flyer Snow Block will work to make a snow block. Sad to have found it for $2.00 at a local discount store a day after its arrival.
5,very helpful when UPS messed up delivery,UPS messed up the shipment but they took care of everything very quickly and we couldnt be happier.
5,Flexible flyer Snow Block Maker,Great quality product and more importantly it is made in the USA! My 6 year old loved the present from Santa.
2,Did not arrive by Christmas,This item was ordered 2 weeks before Christmas and was guaranteed for Christmas arrival. It did not arrive until Dec. 30th. UPS was very unhelpful. I would not purchase from this vendor again.
4,"So simple, but really fun. Could be bigger though.","It's surprising how a simple little thing like a plastic box can make such a big difference. Having something to mold snow when you're building is really really helpful. The only thing is, it could afford to be a little bigger. The blocks are pretty small, but it also makes them manageable for little kids. And how can you complain about the price? I mean, sure it's a three cent piece of plastic, but still, it's hard to get anything under $5 anymore. For what you pay, the quality is fine and it get's the job done."
3,Smaller than I envisioned,"It would take a kid forever to build a wall of snow or sand bricks with this thing! Despite it's size, it seems to be made of pretty durable plastic. It should hold up at least through this season."
1,Buyer Beware,If you are looking to buy this for your xbox 360 don't waste your money like I did! I don't usually write reviews but I had to for this product. The picture is misleading. When I received my rf unit there was no unit for the xbox 360 only for the xbox. They need to remove that photo because it is misleading. I have lost trust in amazon.
2,not so good,It may have been a one off but the unit wouldnt switch on properly. I would turn on my Gamecube and then I would have to change the channel or turn the tv off and on for it to work. I would not buy this again.
2,Not So Hot,"Saxophonist Wessell Anderson fronts quartets and trios on this outing, closing off with a solo performance on ""Mood Indigo."" Musically, this CD is pleasant enough, but it is the sound quality that compels me to write. This disk is HDCD-encoded, and played through a non-HDCD player, it sounded soft and rolled off--pleasant, but not very realistic. How much was microphone choice and/or placement and how much was HDCD encoding I do not know, but what I do know is that despite the claims that HDCD recordings are supposed to sound better than other recordings even when played back through non-HDCD decoders, I am beginning to consider the little HDCD notice a good reason to pause before deciding whether to spend my money. Add to that the dismaying news that this recording is barely over 40 minutes long, and I don't think too many people will go out of their way to buy it. My copy went back to the used-CD store where I picked it up."
1,Lens Drx damaged my lens,"The products ranks one of the worse products I have ever bought. A lot of products do not live up to claims, or simply do not function. This product, however, damages your lens by smearing an opaque coating on the lens, rendering the glasses useless, and damaging the lens.My glasses were made of poly plastic,not glass."
1,This product is a scam.,"I bought this product to get rid of scratches on my sunglasses, and it did NOTHING but make it worse with a blurry glaze. The infomercial is still playing on tv!! I DON'T GET IT. Thank god I was able to return it and get a refund.Somebody needs to put the lens dr hooligans in jail."
5,I built this solar greenhouse,"The hubs were constructed according to the plans. A trench below the frost line was dug to create a dry earth frost barrier. All materials came from the local building supply, except the roll of greenhouse glazing plastic. The 25 foot dome was built of 2x2s cut from 2x4s. The dome stood five or six years in Idaho without any maintenance. I used 10 50 gallon drums filled with water and painted black for heat storage, and had tomatoes on the vine in December, though they had stopped growing when the daylight hours declined. A large snow while I was traveling took it down. Maintenance would have prevented this."
5,Awesome,This is the most awesome watch I have ever owned. Don't have to worry about setting it - ever. And it looks nice also.
2,Great watch but face is not illuminated,"This watch is very cool. I love the look and everything about it. It is BIG, very high on the wrist. The only problem is that the light only illuminates the digital display. The face has no light. Just thought this information may be helpful for somebody as it was a surprise to me. I would highly recommend this watch otherwise, but I really need the face to light up so it will have to be returned. Too bad.."
3,Confusing UI,"This watch has a confusing UI. Setting and unsetting time after DST is a pain, but otherwise the watch is rock solid."
5,prank calls done brooklyn style,"still makes me laugh after all these years.2 guys from brooklyn prank call people from doctors to lawyers,convincingly.they are so good at it and they know how to do it to make it down right hysterical.yankee haters might not be able to appreciate this and too bad for them because they don't know what they're missing.my favorite moments are with sol,a woody allenesque nerd who has problems with his glasses,roids,motorbike,and a fascination with his shoes.other good moments are with the gay man and frank rizzo.the last track is also great about a man and his son who call a plumber expecting it to be their uncle freddie. good stuff folks,that everyone,ecept children of course, should check out for the laughs."
3,"Good to have, but not best","If your looking for quick laughs i would recommend that you buy their second cd or anyone after that, especially "" Stop Staring at Me"" that one is histerical. This one is good to have though to complete the set."
3,The Hipster Spies With His Mystic Eye--- No. Just no.,"The Jerky Boys humor ages poorly, & is a little past its ""use by date"".Not bad, if you're nostaltgic, but their time is past."
4,Sticks to the obvious,"Old, and out of print, but yet available at Amazon.""Running wild"" by David Stenn is good when it comes to facts and events,while ""The It Girl"" by Morella/Epstein get a better grip on Bow as a whole.Buy both."
1,Poorly-edited piece of crap!,"The audio quality on this DVD is HORRIBLE! There are frequent periods where the sound cuts out for LONG periods of time, and I've bought more than one copy from other sources--so apparently, EVERY copy is like this. What a TERRIBLE editing job! These scenes with no audio should have been removed or re-recorded. I cannot believe this DVD was even released commercially in this condition, because it is so UNPROFESSIONAL! Virtually UNWATCHABLE! DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!!!"
1,it felt like it went on forever,this was just not a very good doc people just wined and complained about how much they hated each other it looked like it was filmed by a ten year old and it didn't even come with a case or litho just don't waste your time or money and buy beyond the mat.
2,She feels sorry for him.,"My daughter, 6, saw the commercials and wanted this for Christmas. I should have paid more heed to the bad reviews already on this site. The ramp never stays on the house - the dog gets caught on the side of the house when turning the corner - it just walks around aimlessly and spins. That's it. My daughter does not want to take ""him"" back to the store - after all - it's a ""pound"" puppy - it needs a good home. She loves him and wants to keep him, because she doesn't want to make him sad by giving him away. She could have gotten just as much from the cheaper, non-battery operated pound puppies."
1,What A Piece Of Junk!,"We got this toy for our 3 year old daughter for Christmas this past year. I can't believe this toy actually made it to production! The puppy does not respond to sounds. It does not respond when you touch it's nose. All it does is come out of it's house, spin around, bark and try to go back into it's house. I said try because it usually can not do that iether.I would have sent it back, but the thing was so difficult to get out of the packaging, we had to rip it up just to remove the toy so we could put it under the tree on Christmas Eve.I hate wasting my money on crappy products! It is even worse when you buy a gift for a child that turns out to be crap!Don't buy this!"
1,Don't spend your money,"I don't have this toy, but I saw the commercial and all it did was walk and go in and out if it's house. LLike me, kids could have the same fun with one of the small dogs in the dog house, sold in Animal Alley. Normally I only write reveiws about toys I loved, but not maney people loked yhis toy. Don't get it, find out it doesn't work, and try to return it but your kid doesn't want to give it up. If you read the other reviews you find out that the ramp doesn't stay on, and the dog only walks and spins. The kids on the commercial are paid to pretend they are having fun. You could get a dog even better for only $5.00. A lot cheper. I am not saying that Toys R US is an bad store, just this toy is a bad toy. I read the other reviews. It isn't worth it."
5,Unbelievable!,"I just finished watching ""Seconds"" on AMC and immediately went online to find it on DVD. I cannot figure out why this film has managed to stay off of every single critic's top 5 list! All I can say is you must purchase this film now and have it shipped next day air. ""Seconds"" is a film that could have been made last year and still be cutting edge. Cinemetographically, it is an obvious influence for Darren Aronofsky (Pi). Rock Hudson's performance was absolutely phenomenal. The plot is gripping. I COULD NOT turn off this film.Although I am reluctant to ever place such lofty praise on a film, I simply cannot say enough good things about ""Seconds"". I agree with a fellow reviewer: it is definately a SIN that this film is not on DVD and it is equally as bad that Criterion Collection has not picked this film up. WHY? WHY? WHY?"
5,"if you could ,would you start over again","that is the central question in john frankenhammer's ""seconds""a middle aged man,bored and not happy with his life is told of a company called reborns that ""for a fee"" will make you over and give you a new life. after so talking and an operation the man comes out looking like rock hudson. great who wouldn't want to look like rock. but then your looks are all that has changed and the problems you had are still with you, as rock finds out.the last 10 mins. of this movie will stun and scare you to death. no more about it but to say rock hudson gave the proformance of his life and this thriller will be with you long after it ends."
4,Would never have thought Rock Hudson...,"Caught this late one night on some cable channel. Intrigued from the get go: plot; characters; actors, Rock Hudson. Certainly worth a view if you like a little off beat fiction."
4,Seconds - the movie Rock Hudson enjoyed MOST to make,"I had been curious about this movie and when I finally got to see it, I enjoyed it very much. It is an unusual story line, one that kept my mind occupied from beginning to end."
1,Piece of [Garbage],"I am a high school student, and my class recently viewed this travesty of a movie. Along with the worst ending ever, Rock Hudson must have been high when he was TRYING to act in this one. One morale of the movie was ""Spend time with your loved ones and enjoy every moment of your life"" So, to all who read this review, take the advice of the morale and DO NOT see this movie...."
5,An excellent boost to recharge a flat prayer life.,"I gave myself this book for my 50th birthday and it's the most important book I own besides a copy of my NIV Bible. I thought that I had read everything there was to be found in this genre; daily devotionals, pamphlets, memoirs of godly women, biographies of godly men, etc. Yet, nothing has been as fulfilling as this book. In ""Prayers Women Pray"" the authors share their prayers in a style that the reader can connect with. The chapters close with scriptures for further meditation and references to Psalms. This is an ideal segue for someone who is new to the Bible and would like to augment their prayer time by seeing how a specific Psalm cited in ""Prayers"" was chosen to fit the selected prayer. This book is an invaluable asset to anyone's prayer life, male or female. I highly recommend it and it will make a wonderful Mother's Day gift."
2,Waste of time and money,"You've heard them all before, and most were -- and still are -- great tracks. But this three disc compilation is a shameless throw-together. The mix is uninspired, the engineering is so-so, and disc three makes no sense at all. Overall, bad execution of a reasonably good idea."
5,classical chill,"i stumbled onto schnauss as a recommendation spawned from another purchase, and shortly picked up all his disks. john diliberto's (amazon) review strikes me as accurate and justly appreciative. schnauss's music has an overall sheen and slickness that disguises some very carefully worked out musical details, hidden in plain view within its minimalist musical ideas and synthetic instrumental textures. the music sometimes seems near to veer into eurotrash hipness and urbanity, or discotrash superficiality, or just plain brainless electronica, but it avoids those hazards by means of a slowly evolving musical landscape that is embued with optimism, warmth and an unpretentious musical integrity."
4,Superlative Downtempo,"Silky smooth stuff here. These downtempo atmospherics will illuminate even the darkest of folk. Get a decent pair of headphones (neodymium magnets) or an audiophile caliber system and let this masterpiece melt into you. Ulrich is a gifted and outstanding young talent. Cheers Ulrich--- easy on the bubblegum though- it'll send ya to the dentist. Further Recommended Downtempo - Chillout Phase 2, BOC, ESL, K&D, Tosca, WES MONTGOMERY, KENNY BURRELL."
5,Current Favorite,I love everything Ulrich Schnauss does. This is an awesome CD. Excellent for background while working on other projects. I listen to it all the time.
2,BOOOOOOOOOOOORING,"Very unimaginative album, probably whipped this thing up in a day or 2 on his laptop. Sounds like any other ""chillout' comilation form the early 90's electronica scene... only it's newer. Lacks originality and creativity."
3,What ever happened to this movie???,"I saw this movie when it was released in theaters back in 1979 and remember liking it a lot. A few years later, I think it had a debut TV broadcast on ABC, but since then, it has virtually DISAPPEARED! No VHS, no DVD, not even an occassional broadcast on cable television. Nothing!It's a shame, because long before Michael Douglas's characters were banging the likes of Glenn Close, Sharon Stone and Demi Moore, he gave a rare and emotional performance as a divorced father trying to achieve his dream of Olympic-marathon glory.Michael, please, if by chance you're a web browser, tell your fans what became of this movie! And if not, please send me $[...] to pay the outrageous rip-off price for a European Region 2 coded DVD that will probably play like [...]anyway!Thanks for listening."
1,"Very disappointed -- ""My memory isn't as good as I thought!""","I ran cross country/track in college in the early 70s and I remember when this movie came out and was excited, especially since I liked M Douglas, and competing in the B Rogers & F Shorter era. Over the years I have been extremely disappointed that I could not find a copy to see it again. I'm kind of a running movie junkie owning a number of similar movies (DVDs): Prefontaine (J Leto), The Jericho Mile (P Strauss), On The Edge (B Dern), The Loneliest Runner (M Landon), Without Limits - Prefontaine (B Croudup), Running Brave (R Benson), ... in my DVD collection.Picking up this DVD a month-or-so ago I was astounded how up-side-down my memories of this movie were --- ouch. Have watched the Prefontaine and Running Brave movies numerous times, but I will not watch Running again as it accumulates dust on my bookshelf. M Douglas is still a favorite, but this movie is a thumbs down."
3,A fun mystery,"It was a good adventure with a good amount of depth.I even told the game to Margaret Kiddor, in which she played the bartender at the Broken Skull. I had to refresh her memory to know what lines she had.You gotta love the three funny outtakes during the end credits."
5,Great book,My son loves finding the duck on every page. There's lots of other things you can ask them to find also so I think it really builds their vocabulary as well.
4,Another good choice,I have several of the Farmyard books. They are beautifully colored and have wonderful illustrations to where my 3-yr. old grandson does not get bored. He looks for the little duck on every page. Such a unique touch in these books. Thanks for making another learning tool fun for children.
4,Excellent-if you are ready for it!!,"An exceedingly simple and logical book which transcends most of todays belief systems with the effort of a shrug. Reading it I couldn't stop wondering why nobody had ever told me all of this before. If you have no problem with the fact that you have been here innumerous times and are not just here for a party but have something to do, you'll like this book and may well find it usefull. Otherwise it might not hold your interest for long."
3,decent tv movie,"The 70's was a weird decade. With movies like The Exorcist and The Omen, the supernatural was a prevalent element in horror movies. Even stranger it spread into the tv movies of the time. Lifetime they weren't. Witchcraft, entities, and haunted houses were regular topics. (I have two listmanias devoted to this.)The Spell is admittedly a ""Carrie"" rip off. A fat girl is taunted at school and criticized at home. It also doesn't help that her sister is a pretty, popular and young Helen Hunt. With the help of her young gym teacher the girl obtains occult powers and uses them to punish her enemies. Unfortunately the movie isn't as interesting as its premise but it's all right. 2.5 rounded to 3."
5,A small piece to a laeger puzzle,I purchased this hypnotherapy cd title based on the positive reviews I saw posted and was not dissapointed. I feel that they are providing me with a noticeable benefit in positively reprogramming my mind for success and financial abundance. I listen to the programs once upon rising and again before bed. Glenn Harold's voice combined with the soothing music is quite relaxing. I intend on purchasing some of the other Glenn Harold hypnotherapy titles. As a complimentary piece to a larger success program I think these cd's present another avenue to assist anyone in redirecting their way of thinking so that success dominates their consciousness.
2,A slip from mr. Harrold,"Glenn Harrold's produces fine hypnotic CDs and much of his work is first rate. Unlike some of his master pieces (A Chakra MeditationandUnleash Your True Potential) this CD however is not worth much. It generally centers around the feeling of deserving to be rich instead of tackling the behavior needed to actually become it. Also if you want to achieve financial independence there are much better sources out there, with more concrete and usable knowledge, likeYour Money or Your LifeandRich Dad, Poor Dad.And if all you really wanted was to feel better about yourself, relax and get more energy, then getUnleash Your True Potentialby the same author, it's far better and actually deliver on its promise."
1,Does it work?,"So, who among these reviewers is experiencing unlimited financial abundance because of this cd? I haven't given it any stars because I haven't bought it or listened to it. Yes, I'm highly skeptical and want to find out before I spend my hard-earne d cash whether or not it works. So,again, who among you is experiencing unlimited financial abundance because of this cd?"
3,It's in the details,"Glenn Harrold, BLESS YOU! What a wonderful background this artist has on many levels. Kudos to you and your wife.Now, my wish.. my solid wish.. is you were, shall we say, more ""new age"" (and, interestingly, also Quantum physics) oriented. In an ideal recording this would be one solid recording and not two ~AND~ would be a morphing along with the style/content the likes of Summer McStravick and Kelly Howell.Each of the recording begins with an intro then fades into the relaxation along with instruction on breathing and finally suggestions.I like the recording, it just doesn't flow for me.Again, I keep choosing to listen to Summer McStravick's Flowdreaming series. Check it out."
1,not worth it!!,"it only lasted about 3 weeks and then snapped - not worth it, try something else in leather and velcro"
2,only 5 eps if that,"Season 2 is COMPLETE BS, they take up like 8 episodes doing a ground hog day storyline and they literally play the same damn episode over and over and over and over just changing like outfits or extremely minor details, can not believe they had the balls to pull that crap, its like for season 2 they didn't even try at all. I loved season 1, season 2 is a total waste of time and money, save yourself some gray hairs and just download the only 4 real episodes from this season."
1,Very very disappointed and was a fan of Haruhi season one,**spoiler** but read if you want to save money and time...The loop of endless 8 is a troll from the creator so pls save your money and just watch episode 1 (the only new episode of the season 2) the skip episode until the last one of endless 8 (episode 9) and the watch the rest 4 episode (that containt the making of episode 00 of season1)
2,endless 8 endless 8 endless 8 endless 8 endless 8 endless 8,endless 8 endless 8 endless 8 endless 8 endless 8 endless 8 endless 8 endless 8 --- OMG!!! WTF!!! i accually watched every endless 8 episodes it was like a bad dream im sure there was a reason for it maybe to fill in a season but can you immagin watching that on t.v.???and for the next 8 weeks all it is... is the same episode? 8 episodes just changed a little...bad ideaafter that the other episodes were good
2,Before you post one stars on here...,"The set of Blu-rays have had very good sales in Japan, no matter how much those otakus complained about it. Those same otakus still went out and bought it. Those set of Blu-rays are about $110. So, in Japan, fanservice still trumps creativity and plot.(Oh yeah, they did this as making Disappearance as a movie would make unimaginable amounts of money. After that plan, all they needed to do was to air the episodes in between, but they were not long enough for 13 episodes. Endless Eight filled that hole.)Disappearance has made 200 million yen and has been at Japan's top 10 list of movies for a while. Fans love it so much that they keep coming to see it, even though they've seen it about 6-100 times. I'm not kidding. It's still going strong. Kyoto Animation will probably do this for the next smash hit. I mean, no matter how much you dump crap on Haruhi fans, they still come back for more."
3,endless eight,the endless eight story arc really makes the price for the second season seem way to much. that story arc should have been done in two passes instead of eight. you are paying for 6 original episodes with 6 filler episodes. the manga did the endless eight arc in just 2 passes.$45 for this is just as stupid as those 6 episodes.
2,Not worth the Price.,"Haruhi Suzumiya is a great series, but this season is not worth a price tag of 60 dollars. To begin this season only contains 14 episodes which is on the short side of an anime. Add in the fact that 8 of these 14 episodes are essentially the same exact episode with different clothing on the characters, and you have 6 episodes of a good anime coming to 10 dollars an episode. Now I don't know how you value entertainment, but 10 dollars for 24 minutes of fun is not a good buy in my opinion. Stay away till a decent price drop."
3,Ummm....,"This is a pretty average series overall, though there are some interesting concepts involved. I've seen there is a new series coming out and I hope it is better. I've watched this series once, most of my anime gets watched twice in the first month alone... but I've been lucky in getting some really good ones, thanks in part to reviews left here. At $20-$25 I'd consider it worth picking up, but it needs to be put into a slim case."
1,A waste of time,Eight episodes with the exact same plot. Be warned.Animation and voice acting are good. Those eight episodes have different bathing suits for the girls. But there's no payoff and it gets pretty tedious after the third time. Definitely not worth the price.
4,Fairly interesting,"I find the performance of the piano concerto by Grieg rather dull, lacking dynamic breadth and expression. I'm not sure it's Andnes's fault.. The other pieces are better.The works themselves are all enjoyable and Andsnes's clinical approach suits many of these pieces well although others may be lacking colour. The performance of the Shostakovich concerto is really good here. In it the trumpet brings the colour to the table with Andnes's clinical piano playing contrasting perfectly against the vivid trumpet lines.I award this CD three and half stars. The low price adds a bargain feature to the package, lifting the rating to four stars..."
2,Battery Tender 021-0156 Battery Tender Plus 12V battery charger,"Not sure that this is a good unit. Keep having to replace brand new batteries. Have had the car checked for a battery draw by a very reputable electrical auto shop, and they think that I shouldn't use this. My car is a garaged car for the long rainy Pacific NW winters. I only take the car out on dry days, which sometimes are 3 months apart. The guys at the shop believe that this device is actually ruining the batteries, by ""Overcharging"" since I have smelled a very strong vinegar type smell. I thought that the Battery Tender WOULDN'T overcharge, but they say that's what has happened, 3 times, with 3 brand new batteries. They suggested that I only put it on the car for two weeks before I plan to use the car, which is hard to do, not knowing the weather that far ahead. Disappointed, but not sure what to do about it."
5,Well made and it works!,I have had other tricle chargers before but this one does the job well. It wont cook your battery like the cheap ones can. I use it on 2 motorcycles and all my other batteries too. Get this one you will be pleased with it.
5,Battery Tender plus,"The product is, without question, the best charger on the market for gel cell batteries. The price was almost $20 under the competition. Very satisfied with the product, the price and the delivery."
3,What is pictured is NOT what is in the package,When I ordered this Battery Tender Plus unit it showed it had a harness with eyelets and a harness with alligator clips. Neither come with the Battery Tender Plus unit. Upon reading it never said it did come with more than the connector end. I now either have to get one from around town or reorder online and pay shipping for a small item that should be with every brand of BT.
4,check your battery type,be careful when ordering a battery tender. This model is for gel-type batteries although the description does not state such.I re-ordered the correct type and could not be happier with the product.
5,Should have bought it sooner,"Easy hook up, now I don't have to worry about a dead battery, great product, I don't know why I haven't purchased this before."
5,I liked it so much I bought a 2nd one.,"Gel cell batteries apparently should not be charged too quickly if allowed to run down. More over, they don't respond well to 'trickle' charges and if you're dealing with a small, infrequently used battery such as on a lawn mower, airplane, or marine battery, this charge will slowly bring the charge up to full and then keep a proper maintenance voltage going to the battery to optimize the life of the battery. My experience with this Battery Tender has been wonderful. My boat, plane, and lawn mower have never been happier...and me too."
5,Great tender,"Have used one for years on my BMW, had to replace it due to my electrician causing a surge that fried allh tne low voltage stuff in my garage."
1,1 year and 6 months,"Mine lasted about a year and a half. They probably use junk parts like everyone else does these days. After reading other reviews on the warranty, I wont even bother wasting my time."
2,Started out well but then became irritating,"I read this book a year ago, partly based on the 5-star rating of another reviewer. Well, I was woefully disappointed and finally feel compelled to not let this 5-star rating stand any longer. The first half of this book was well-done but the last half was awful. The characters, which were likeable in the beginning, started to turn really, really irritating. I cannot recall another book in which my opinion changed so drastically before. I mean sometimes you may not be happy with the ending or thought the beginning started too slowly, but this book simply turned into claptrap well before the end. There are many funny and well-written Regencies out there, a lot of them older titles. Find those; don't waste your money on this one."
1,Garbage!,"What a total waste of money. Our first time out and my son went no more than 20 feet on the trail and just as he was going over a small mogal, they cracked right in half! He is only 8 years old and 55 lbs., definately within the limit for use of these skis. It was a very disappointing trip for our family."
2,"Voice is there, but lyrics are overdone","Disappointing! Underwood will shine in later albums, but for now she'll just have to ""get by"" with an overdone CD that will go platinum. (Poor girl.)She's in fine voice, as expected, and has a couple of highlight songs in ""Before He Cheats"" and ""Whenever Your Remember"". Other than that, expect the usual American Idol hackjob that Kelly, Fantasia, and Clay have had to endure. Way too many syrupy selections, production that takes away rather than adds to the singer's personality, and so on.However, if you loved ""Inside Your Heaven"", this will be right up your saccharine alley. Meanwhile, I'll be selling mine at the corner used CD shop, and giving Kim Locke's record another few spins instead."
3,Same Mood through whole CD,"DJ Fraiser ""Wendy"" took the words right out of my mouth! I often find people from NZ are smart about music.I have been a vocal coach since 1977. The songs on the CD is in the same mood. I got board with it. However, Carrie's voice is lovely, and she could use much better choice of songs."
1,Her album will be a flop for sure,"only because of how terrible she is! She doesn't deserve 4 stars, she doesn't even deserve 1 star. It will have to do though. Lessons Learned has pretty lyrics but she doesn't sing then well. Which is a prime example of the entire CD. Pretty lyrics, bad voice."
1,"She needs to personalize her music, put an ID tag on it...","The way it is now, she won't succeed. She needs to just get up on her feet and sing her soul away. So far she isn't doing that, because she only yells and screams and sings dryly and boringly. I'm sorry."
1,Stop singing about something you can never know,I am disturbed by Carrie's attempt to sing something in which she has not experienced. She is already a dry individual as it is.... sheis even dryer because she cannot exort wht she feels.
1,Place I don't want to be,"She makes me cry, because she reminds me of how I used to feel. I hated my old life, and she sends messages similar to what i've already achieved. She needs to get a life and stop singing songs that she neither wrote, nor experienced. She cannot give depth to a song that she doesn't understand or has experienced."
1,Some Hearts is a bad cover song for her voice,"But it doesn't really matter because none of the songs were good anyway. The only one I remotely liked was ""Starts with Goodbye"" the rest stunk. Sorry Miss Underwood. Go Kelly! Go Hilary!"
1,she stinks!,"she has proven that she stinks. Boo carrie underwood, i never want to hear your voice again"
1,Carrie is a waste of money!!!!,This album stinks like Constantine's un-washed hair. Don't buy it!! It's not worth your time!!
2,Amazing Album by Carrie Underwood,"Okay, Let me start out, I'm a Carrie Underwood fan, HUGE! Like HUGE! I myself bought 50 copies of her CD *for Christmas gifts of course* and 1 for myself. This CD is absolutely amazing. I will admit, I had doubts. I remember talking to my friend and just saying ""I sure hope she doesn't screw up."" Which does sound pessimistic, but Look at the flops of Reuben and Fantasia. Carrie's is different. Every song, every word is filled with emotion and is so amazing. Such great song choices and she sounds even better!! I LOVE IT!!!!Submitted by Lauren in Arkansas"
3,more nice songs,I do not like country music but I loved this album. Before he cheats is my favorite. The rest of the album has very good songs also.
5,Fantastic debut by a pop country superstar!!!,"I will start off by saying I am a 46 year old male who is a music fanatic. I love all types and genres of music. You can't name a type of music that I don't like. I have over 1,500 CD's and I love about 150 different bands and artists. With all this being said I LOVE this CD. Every song is great! It is raw, emotional, and very powerful. By far this is Carrie's best album. She is a true superstar in her business."
5,AWESOME CD!!,"WAY TO GO CARRIE! I AM SO GLAD I VOTED FOR YOU AS THIS ALBUM SHOWS YOU DESERVED IT. IT IS VERY GOOD- ESPECIALLY FOR A DEBUT. GO AND BUY IT YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED. BEST SONGS- JESUS TAKES THE WHEEL, SOME HEARTS, WASTED AND BEFORE HE CHEATS."
5,Carrie Underwood: Some Hearts CD Review,"This CD is one of my favorites. I never tire of the songs. They are upbeat, slow, rhythmic, and have bits and pieces of other types of music in them also, such as R&B and pop. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes country at all or liked Carrie Underwood when she was on American Idol and wanted her to become the American Idol because of her talented singing."
5,Had to buy it,I bought this Cd for a friend knowing she likes Carrie Underwood. I am definitely purchasing one for myself.
4,Carrie's great...and so is Bo!,"Carrie's beautiful voice is front and center on this CD, which is a refreshing change from the generally overproduced American Idol products. Particular highlights for me are the hit single, ""Jesus, Take the Wheel"" and ""Before He Cheats,"" where Carrie shows she can give Gretchen Wilson a run for her money! I believe, as some of the other customers have written, that the editorial reviewer erred in sniping at Bo in her rave review of Carrie. Bo is by no means a ""poser,"" and many AI viewers believe that Bo and Carrie are essentially co-winners who will both have brilliant careers. (I have been a loyal customer of Amazon for many years but am incensed enough about this review to order from other sources in the future.)"
5,WOW!,"Wasted--Good start for this album!Don't Forget To Remember Me--Great lyrics! So meaningful!Some Hearts--Not really my taste. It's too poppy. Doesn't mind having it in this album though.Jesus, Take The Wheel--One of my fav. here!The Night Before--Well, above average song.Lessons Learned--Great lyrics too! Awesome vocals!Before He Cheats--Such a cute song! I love it man!Starts With Goodbye--One of my fav. too!I Just Can't Live A Lie--One of my fav. too!We're Young And Beautiful--So cute! yeah you're realli beautiful!That's Where It Is-She nailed it again!Whenever You Remember---OMG! so nice! great vocals!I Ain't In Checotah Anymore--Well, good music..but lyrics wise..well..um..not my type.Inside Your Heaven--She sung it whole lot better than Bo's version! Gd Job! One of my Fav.!"
2,This is an average CD of country songs.,"I was hoping for something different (more unique) from Carrie based on her American Idol performances. Kelly Clarkson and Daughtry have come out with the best CDs. This CD just kind of blends in with all of the other country songs. I think Kelly Pickler's CD is much better. However, I am interested to see what she will do in her next album."
5,Even more than I expected,"Wow. So many hits on this album. I bought it the day it was released. Okay, so I'm an AMERICAN IDOL fan, but this is by far the best Idol album yet (and I've bought most of them). It is great to see song after song hit number 1. If you like country music sung by female vocalists and you don't have this album yet, immediately order it here, right now. You won't be disappointed."
5,loving it,im so happy that carrier won american idol 05 she has a very good voice bo bice dident have a chance carrier has good things coming her way
1,Bad release,"Horribel album ,she needs to give it up! Nobody has made such a terrible album in at least 10 years, I hope she never sings again. Especially Some Hearts and Lessons Learned are dreadful and deafening to listen to. You should just throw your money away if you are goignot buy this."
1,Essence of Horrible,"Carrie Boringwood - Talentlesswood - Deadwood - Noemotionwood should be her name because she's exactly that. A pretty girl with zero personality and not even memorable. Her music is slightly impressive, but at the same time, it doesn't wow you. The likse of Shania or Martina would clobber her, and her petty little small music. She is terrible."
1,"Kelly is the best Idol, and this CD finalizes it...","I was waiting for Carries cd to come out so the proof wcould finally be available that Kelly was the best Idol yet and it came out and was horrible. This is the final solution that says os, that Kelly is wayy better than Carrie. Go kelly whoohooo its your birthday whoowhooits your birthday... I actually kind of likec carrie on the show but now not anymore.."
5,Amazing,"Carrie once again proves that winner takes all. The album is beautifully arranged,great vocals,and a must-have for any ""Idol"" fan.I really enjoyed every song on here,but my favorite would probably be ""Jesus Take The Wheel."" Nevertheless,all of the songs are very inspiring and moving.This is a girl you'll be seeing around for years to come! The album makes a great Christmas gift,as well as a year-round gift. Buy it today-you won't be disappointed!"
5,Carrie Underwood!,This album proves why Carrie has never been in the bottom three..she has a voice that beautify anything that she sings..what a great album!!!
5,Pretty Good,"I am not a fan of country music and I am still not real big on it. But when I first saw Carrie on the American Idol show I thought ""wow she's good"" I got the CD Kind of expecting boring country songs. But its really good! Any body would like it, even people like me who don't like country music. I saw her sing on the billboard music awards and she just blown me away. My favorite song on the CD Is called some hearts."
5,REFRESHING DEBUT BY GIFTED STAR ON THE RISE.,"This is a wonderful cd debut- i am so proud of carrie who i knew would make it big the moment i heard her sing at her auditions on American idol. The album is a mix of country, pop, and even a little rock at times- and leaves something for everyone. It does not seem like a debut album but more like the work of a vet. Jesus takes the wheel is an amazing ballad- makes you cry. Before he cheats shows a sassy, shania twain side of carrie that really works. Whenever you remember and The night before life goes on- are very beautiful country/pop songs= should also be hits. Some hearts is a catchy pop tune- it grows on you the more you hear it. Wasted is a great country song- very upbeat, good vocals. I aint in checotah anymore is a fun country tune carrie cowrote... Best songs- Jesus take the wheel and Before he cheats. Overall- A+"
5,I'm speechless!!!,"This is simply one of the best CD's I've ever bought!!!From the country tinged first track ""Wasted"" through the final track ""Inside Your Heaven"" (which became a #1 hit on Billboard), this CD is simple amazing!!!Every one of the songs has a message which most of us can relate to... perhaps the best is the first single ""Jesus, Take The Wheel""... which tells a great story about a woman and how she looks at life differently after having her car spin on a highway... quite a powerful message and sung even more powerfully!Other favorites include ""Before He Cheats""... which is a great women's anthem... would sound great on Country radio... also the title track, ""Some Hearts"" is a pop gem... there really isn't a bad song on here.I recommend that you buy one not just for yourself, but for all of your friends and family for Christmas. It is THAT good!!!"
5,Love It!!,"(A 16-year-old kid)This is one of the best albums I have ever heard. All those people rating it 1 star have probably never heard it or didn't like Carrie anyway. She's got a great voice and all these songs are wonderful.My favorites are ""Don't Forget to Remember Me"", ""I Ain't In Checotah Anymore"", ""Some Hearts"" and ""The Night Before (Life Goes On)"". ""Before He Cheats"" is another great song because it shows a whole different side of Carrie that we never saw on 'Idol'.Anyway, Carrie is a fantastic singer! I loved her the moment I saw her. I highly recommend this album. Buy it! You won't be sorry."
5,Applause!!,She did it!Very nice album and very nice collection of songs..keep it up!i'm looking forward to your second album!
5,Some Hearts Is A Hit!,"What a great debut cd. Every song is wonderfully sung. Good Job, Carrie. Keep up the good work and you'll past Kelly Clarkson on the charts."
2,BEST CD EVER!!!,"This CD is one of the BEST CD's I have ever heard!! Every song is absolutely great!! The lyrics, the music, upbeat, ballads, the perfect combination of songs!! I listen to this CD over and over again without getting tired of hearing it!! I am not a huge country fan, but I am SO glad I bought this CD! Believe me, you will love it!! Enjoy! Lisa"
1,I found this to be a bad buy,"A lot of the songs sound very similar, Such as -whenever you remember - -night before- -dont forget to remember me =- -wasted- they all sound the same. I suggest that she not release CDs like this, or else she doesn't stand a chance in the music industry."
1,Worst Idol Winner Debut!,"Kellys, Rubens and Fantasias debuts were much better than this, and Kelly is way more successful. Everyone who's into real country hates Carrie. It's just the people that think their country that like her. True artists compose their own music, play instruments, and sing with a passion. She is a putative manufactured looser. She won't last, wait a few year."
1,Not good enough Miss Underwood....,Carrie Underwood fails to impress me on this album. Every song sounds very similar if not exact.
1,"Well, I'll never buy anything on amazon again.","Why do you people lie? This album is absolutly atrocious. She didn't write any of the songs. Everything sounds the same. Her vocals have a nice studio feel though. Go figure, maybe pick this up if it's in the dollar bin. You'll still feel cheated though. Idiots"
1,Great Karaoke Singer !,Carrie should do a world tour just taking requests of songs by other artists-cause we know she can't write her own material. This album is so boring. I wish they gave her more exciting songs to sing.
1,Same screaming voice,"She sure can belt out a scream, which she did all the time while on AI. Turn it down then it would be so much better."
1,So disappointing,"I was looking forward to this cd, but what a disappointment. Carrie thinks that singing loud equals singing with emotion. It's not the same thing, and screaming a song sure won't convince anyone that she feels a connection to the music. This is the musical equivalent of cotton candy - fluffy and sweet when you put it in your mouth, but gone in a flash and forgotten just as quickly. Too bad, she seemed like she had some potential, but she hasn't learned a thing since the show ended."
1,Boring,I was very disappointed with this and so was my wife! We expected much much more. We have buried this and probably won't ever play it again. A waste of money.
1,Real real bad!,"Wasted - 8/10DFTRM - 5/10Some Hearts - 3/10JTTW - 2/10The Night Before - 8/10Before He Cheats - -1/10Thats Where It Is - 2/10Whenever You Remember - 6/10AICA - 1/10IYH - -1000/10Everything else I can't remember so that goes to show you that the songs hardly have anything unique about them, and they get old REALLY fast. This girl's digging her own grave with this album."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"We have been waiting for this album since the day American Idol 2005 concluded. This album was worth the wait. Its wonderful! The whole family, my wife, children, and myself love it. Carrie pulls it off, and its 10x better than her American Idol material."
1,The Night Before is the only good song..,"This album is terrible, with Jesus Take the Wheel in peticular. I don't know why radio stations even play it, they would probably get LESS listeners! Carrie fans, what were you thinking to buy this?"
1,BRAVO!! 5 stars!!,"Seriously, this is the best album I have ever listened to. Every song is well done and filled with emotion. It will be a best seller. I aplaud you Carrie!"
1,Brutal...rescue me.,"My wife recently received this album as a present. She played it in the car during a long trip to Vermont in a snow storm. I must have done something very evil to be subjected to this ordeal. Ouch. Pain. Agony. I felt that my ears were keyed and battered with a Louisville Slugger. This woman manages - on every bloody song - to hit tones that even the CIA would classify as torture.Every track is the same - soft followed by loud; over-produced instrumentation; and overly compressed sound. I wouldn't waste my time commenting on this album if I thought that Ms. Underwood didn't have the talent. She obviously has plenty of talent and, as she matures, will hopefully dump her current producers and come up a more diverse and interesting product."
1,very over-hyped,"This album has about 3 good songs on it. The rest you can have-as I'm sure alot of country singers turned down these leftover songs before they threw em' at Carrie. It's too bad, cause she has a nice voice."
2,Carrie 'Underwood' or 'Deadwood'?,"Cold, calculating and about as sexy as lipstick on teeth [the CD, not she], Carrie Underwood's 'Some Hearts' is about as dull sonically as her persona is visually. Her home-spun, down-home, aw-shucks attitude endeared her to millions on AI, but to what price? Can't fault her for the song choices - all typical of bad contemporary country-pop - she didn't write them; and she has zilch - zip - zero say in the production values. But I CAN fault her for her vocals. Yes, her 'technique' is on the mark...but since when does technical proficiency equal emotional capacity? She sings each song like a Star Search audition. It's not the worst of the Idol's CDs [i still believe Clay Aiken's 'Measure of A Man' is the most abominable of ALL Idol related releases], but it's still such a stagnant, emotionless dirge so unequivocally banal, we might have to rename her Carrie 'Deadwood'. My grade: C"
1,Carrie Underwood will fail,"awful album by a pathetic singer!! Carrie Underwood sang these songs on American Idol! She didn't even do a good job then, what makes people think shes going to make a good cd now. She is awful! This album is awful!! She never sang the songs good and she recorded them like crud!"
5,Another Kelly fan behind me...,There's another Kelly fan behind me..please..ur trashing is not gonig to suceed. Let's be honest. This album is very good. There are lots of decent and outstanding tracks.Carrie and Kelly are the only two sucessful 'Idols' so far.
4,Good Initial Effort,"I have to say the Bo was my pick to win American Idol, although I liked Carrie too. I bought both of their albums, and in my humble opinion Carrie clearly comes out the winner. Song selection and her over all performance is classic country-pop. (Is that an oxymoron?) Anyway, she clearly has the voice and the pipes to belt out these songs. I don't think any of the songs qualify as an anthem, but the album is probably good enough to get her a second shot."
1,Carrie Underwood is bad!!!,Wasted is the best song. The rest are mediocre. I was actually how amazed how most of everything else was rushed and crappily done.
1,Before He Cheats,"The life of Carrie Underwood exists within that one song. This is the type of music she needs to sing to succeed. Not sappy, construde ballads like ""Whenever you Remember.' Beautiful girl, lacking my interest only because of poor song choice."
1,Offended by this intense use of religion as a tool,"Religion is not a tool to steer your life in the right way. What are you talking about? We, as people, must steer our lives and push ourselves in the right direction. We cannot rely on a supreme being to do that for us. She is so immature on this album, I really would prefer not to comment on any individual songs, because then I would just seem a basher. I am trying to be honest here without being brutally honest. I guess I would just say, ""what goes around comes around"" miss Underwood."
3,WHERE IS ANGELS BROUGHT ME HERE?,"The song i think won here the season, and its not on the album shame i think it would have been a No.1, however if you liked the some american idol austraila winner GUY SEBASTAIN does sing it better a soulful guy if you can buy it BUY it, u wont be dissapointed!"
3,Not Special Yet,"Carrie is a good role model for young girls. If you liked her on a show you will like this CD as well. There is ""crying"" type of song, ""trouble"" song, old-fashioned ""washing powder commercial"" songs, vocal gymnastics, and so on. Overall, it is a very safe and predictable CD."
5,AMAZING,"This CD is amazing! i love every single song... i would buy 80000 more just in case one breaks but i dont have enough money. her single ""Jesus take the wheel"" i GREAT! and ""Some Hearts"" is my favorite. i think EVERYONE should buy it. my mom HATES country but she absoultly LOVES this CD."
4,"America Was Right, I Was Wrong","I voted for Bo Bice during American Idol season four. Now, after hearing Carrie Underwood's stellar freshman achievement, I'm knocked out. She truly is the ultimate American Idol. From start to finish, this album sounds like an old pro who's been at it forever. Okay, let me correct that. Up until the last actual album cut and before the added-on Idol anthem ""Inside Your Heaven"" which is just hideous, it's great. That song seems completely out-of-place and below everything else that comes before it. Strongest cuts, definitely - Before He Cheats, Wasted, and the title track. I'm impressed. She can absolutely hold her own among the company of Shania, Faith and Martina. Good for you, Carrie. And again, sorry for not quite seeing your capabilities during your season. I've learned my lesson."
4,NOT BAD FOR A COUNTRY CD,THIS IS NOT A BAD CD. I JUST AM NOT A FAN OF COUNTRY AND WESTERN. CARRIE UNDERWOOD IS A RISING STAR AND THIS CD SHOW IT. LIKE I SAID NOT BAD FOR A COUNTRY CD.
2,disappointing,"I love Carrie's voice, but I was disappointed with this album. She sings everything in an artificial, (nasal?) style, not a clear tone in sight. I also found the songs dull and repetitive."
1,Horrible album by American Idol winner!,"This album proves that she didn't deserve to win.. its so bad that it makes me angry that the record company dared to release such a crappy album. Did they really think that people wouldn't notice? Well , I did."
1,Generic fodder,"This is a prime example of why country stations are disappearing & sales are at an all time low. Anyone who remembers the quality country music from 15 years ago, and farther back will realize this is future bargain bin material, another modern Mindy McCready. Flash, gone. Check back on this in 3 years, hang on until there 100 of these CDs on Amazon for $2.00.This release has a new glam-country, plastic, generic feel that will sell in mass to the niave buyers that has been brainwashed to think that today's country is good. Today's country is not selling; it's declining rapidly in popularity. Sure, Carrie should have won American Idol and has talent, but it's been wasted on this Walt Disney equivalent material. Real wussy fluff - she's the country Hillary Duff. There's a new song for ya."
1,Generic rubbish,If you've heard one modern country singer you have heard them all.Nothing really new or soulful here. Just another blonde with alot of makeup on with a generic voice.
2,"Great singer, so so songs, bad production","Carrie's debut CD is very disappointing. Carrie's voice presents great potential. Heavy instrumentation on some songs dilutes her voice. Poor song selection adds to the problem; only ""Heaven"" is noteworthy. Carrie needs a new producer if her potential is to be fully realized. Allison Krauss could save Carrie from her path of disaster."
5,Great Debut Album,Carrie's debut album is so great and powerful!! I really enjoyed this album. It is not your typical american idol artist. Every song on this album is entertaining. It is definitely an album you can listen to all the time and never get tired of it. I definitely recommend it.
1,I'm really disgusted!,"I expected better, she sounds childish on this album. I wish she would just give it up! I saw her on tv and she looked like a dear in headlights!"
1,I hate this album!,It sounds so disgusting her voice is like when you are boiling water and you leave your tea cup on too long. She squeals like a sow thats being killed. I don't get how 'no talents' like Carrie Underwood get a record deal. Buy other music from some different artists instead.
1,"Don't buy this, she is bad!!","I will admit that I am a Shania Twain fan, but that doesn't make me like her any less from the start. I bought the CD because i love country music. She isn't good at all, in fact, she sounds the same on EVERY single song. It actually makes me sick. I was amazed at how this girl actually made it as far as she did. Shania sings every song with her own style and sasss, that America has grown to love her for, thats why she sells so much. This girl has no style to grasp, and no individuality. The ONLY song on this album that shows anything other than generics is Before He Cheats."
1,She is a bad apple in country music,"My review was deleted so I thought I would rewrite it. Carrie Underwood is bad at country music. It's a hard genre to be bad at, but even her cannot harness the music of the soul."
5,"Excellent CD, with only one minor complaint","I love Carrie, she was my favorite from the very beginning of Idol last season...Simon was right, she has the ""it"" factor and she's extremely likeable. Carrie puts out her solo CD and it's pretty impressive, all the music here is extremely likeable...I only have one minor complaint, but I won't lower my rating of the CD because of it...I really really wish they included Angels Brought Me Here on this CD. For those of you that don't remember, Angels Brought Me Here was essentially the song that won her the competition, and it's really terrible that this song wasn't on the single or on this CD because it's a really good song...otherwise, this CD is excellent, well worth buying"
5,So good!,"I am not generally a country music fan, expect for the occassional Dixie Chicks or Faith Hill song, but I LOVE this album. Favorite tracks: ""Wasted,"" ""Before He Cheats,"" ""Jesus Take the Wheel,"" ""Some Hearts,"" and ""Starts with Goodbye."" Carrie does an amazing job on these power ballads. I'm very impressed. I watched ""American Idol"" and thought she was good, but this CD makes me think she's going to have the staying power that Kelly Clarkson has had."
4,A great debut.,"I first heard of Carrie when I watched American Idol and thought she was very good. Especially when she sang country songs like Martina McBride's ""When God-Fearin' Women get the Blues"" and Dixie Chicks' ""Sin Wagon"". So I was looking forward to her first cd, and I wasn't disapointed. It's very good. Carrie sounds great, and does songs that are right for her age and people around her age. ""Wasted"" talks about having no regrets and going forward with life, ""Don't Forget to Remember me"" is for all those young kids leaving home for the first time and being on their own. There are also break up songs, and love songs on here, all sung very well. Carrie has a long career ahead of her.Best Tracks:WastedDon't Forget to Remember MeJesus, Take the WheelThe Night Before (Life Goes On)That's Where it is"
4,impressive,"I not usually a country fun, but Carrie Underwood's debut album is fantastic. Carrie shows off the magnificent voice that helped her to be crowned American Idol. These lush country tunes are a delight to listen to, the standouts being ""Jesus takes the wheel"" , ""Some hearts"", ""Wasted"" and ""Whenever you remember."" Carrie showed incredible depth in her vocals, belting out and nailing the high notes with an unrivalled intensity. The lyrics to the songs are fantastic and the production of the Album excellent. Carrie Underwood has the talent and personality to succeed when other idols (Ruben, Justin) have failed, and she is well on her way to stardom with this solid debut.This album is highly recommended"
4,Some Hearts-Carrie's first debut,"Title: Some Hearts Year: 2005Artist: Carrie Underwood Genre: CountryThe song "" Some Hearts"" debuts on Carrie Underwood's first hit CD, ""Some Hearts"". The sizzling starlet from American Idol quotes ""He better think before he cheats"". Her first hit album has 14 songs including ""Lessons Learned"", ""Inside Your Heaven"" and ""That's Where It Is"".Personally, I loved this CD and I'd give it four stars, or, as they say on the radio, two gold fingers up. My favorites were ""That's Where It Is"", ""Jesus Take The Wheel"" and ""Before He Cheats"".I recommend this CD to everyone, even if they don't like country music or love songs, because I guarantee that they will like it."
5,winner before it was even released,"I've seen Idol once, but it only took that episode to realize Carrie was going to be a talented crossover star. Every song on this album is a hit single backed by strong and meaningful sonwriting. Her vocal range is incredible. I had some doubts when a pretty teenager who fits the perfect package for the marketing machine was annointed the Idol title, but she is the real deal"
2,Pretty much what I expected...,"Well I gave her album a fair chance, and it just got old real quick...kinda like her on American Idol. I do like ""Jesus Take the Wheel"", and ""Before He Cheats"". All of the others sound too similar for me."
1,she is a bad singer!,Carrie stunk on American Idol and her CD is even worse! What a flop! Go Kelly!!!
1,"she is an awful, disgusting person!!!","She looks like the cookie monster. My mom played her CD in the car and she sounded like a goat to me. I looked at the CD and it looks wierd because she was smiling freaklishly like the Mona Lisa. This is an evil CD, stay away from it!"
1,Carrie Underwood doesn't have what it takes!,"This album is very fake, and Carrie's voice is not cut for the songs. She strains her voice too much and there is no spark to the album. I could find any other country album like this if I wanted to. If I could give it negative stars, I would. Don't buy this, folks."
2,not the best,"I don't think she was the best contestant on Idol this year. I liked Constantine and I stopped liking Carrie at all when she was laughing at Con being voted off, as she was hugging Anthony. And, when she mouthed ""I love you"" to Anthony, she caused his girlfriend to dump him. It was like a drama and, now I can't take her seriously. She should have gone to Nashville Star. That would have been better for her."
3,Not too bad,"I like Carrie Underwood's voice, but I found a lot of these songs to be the same. She starts soft in her lower range (which I prefer) and then the chorus goes up and she does her 'power' voice, which to me can get a bit screechy. The whole thing seems to be very repetitive. The lyrics are pretty good though."
2,As expected,"I had high hopes for her first album. There was only one song that I liked. Kind of reminds me of when I bought LeAnne Rimes first cd for the song ""Blue"" . The rest of the cd was a disappointment."
3,It's...OK,"I bought this album from a brick and mortar store, and spent too much for an album that in my opinion is just adequate. I bought it for ""Before He Cheats"" hopeful that more than just that one song would grab my attention. There are a few songs that I've learned to accept (Wasted and Jesus, Take the Wheel) but for the most part, the songs were kind of downers.I think with a little work to come fully into her craft, and to hone her techiques (this is her debut album, after all) she could become a singer worth paying full price for. Right now, it's cookie-cutter ""this is what you're supposed to sing because the public likes it"" music that just about everyone seems to be dumping on the market. I applaud her for original lyrics. I will stand and applaud once she does original sounding compositions to go with them."
1,She is awful! Get a life loser!,"You guys are totally losers! Kelly Clarkson is the best artist ever!! OMG I love her album. This one sucks though, she sounds like an old granny and she sounds boring. She looks like an old freak on her cover with ugly bleach blonde hair. I hope that she stops singing for the sake of America."
1,terrible music by a bad artist!!,"I hate this album, she sounds terrible on this stupid album. I hate 'Some Hearts' too. I really wish she wouldn't be like this, I liked her on American Idol but certainly not anymore."
1,Her vocal teacher needs to be fired...,"Whoever suggested that she sings needs help. She is the most awful person i've heard in my entire life. My daughter MADE me purchase this album for her. I never fancied her on American Idol and I dislike her even more now. She screams and yells like a disturbed baboon on this album. She even made my 1 year old son cry. Hopefully, you will turn away now, if you need more information. Try listening to the samples, they made sound slightly appealing, but nonetheless, they are bad. Wasted and Some Hearts are the worst."
2,not up to par,"im a big country music fan, but i still dont hear the passion or rather see the passion for her yet.......maybe as she grows, i just am not too impressed .....sorry"
1,Boring,She seems very cold and disconnected. I do like before he cheats so 3 stars for that song alone.
1,duplicating reviews is poor work ethic,"I am offended that somebody stole my writing. Please remove their review, amazon. Regardless, Carrie is the worst artist of the decade, in fact, the worst artist i've heard in all my life. She screams and is terrible at country. I hate her ugly shrilly voice and she's worse than Hilary Duff."
2,Not impressed,"I didn't watch American Idol but did know her name and that people really liked her so I tried the album. She does have a good voice but its immature yet. This album sounds like it was recorded in her garage.I think she'll get there eventually, and due to the American Idol fame, will do very well with this album. I personally won't listen to it again."
1,Just terrible,"carrie is a horrible role model for America and she should go back to where she came from. She can't sing to save her life, and the album seems very manufactured with no effort. Stay away from this buy."
4,..and I don't like country music!!,"Wow! I was pretty impressed. I watched AI and predicted Carrie and Bo to be the final two. They both deserved it, and this album proves it!Yes, I know there are those of you who think Bo should of won, but I think his album will be just a great!(Kelly might have some competition here...hmmmm)"
5,country girl goes to the top,"I remember when I first saw Carrie Underwood on American Idol. She was carrying a bucket of milk wearing a T shirt, and was on her father's farm. She radiated a cleaness and pureness ... the wholesome farm girl. That is also in her album."
4,Great CD!,"I think this CD is great. Some of the songs are pretty cheesy, but Miss Underwood has a great voice going for her. And I think it's pretty awesome that she co-wroted one of the songs! I can't wait for her next album."
1,Carrie Underwood is a disgrace!,"As a resident in Checotah, OK, I vowed myself to Carrie as soon as she tried out for American idol. I was dissapointed when i bought her single, as I though tit would be really good. It turned out to be awful, but I decided to give her another chance, her album was just as bad."
1,Carrie Underwood - Some Hearts,She isn't the kind that you call lucky? Well maybe that's because she isn't good enough. I recall Simon saying something very promising about this young girl. She blew it.
1,an overall bad album,"Some Hearts is a perfect example of a flat out bad album. From Wasted to Some Hearts to The Night Before to Inside your Heaven, it never ends. She sounds the same, not good not good. 1 star."
1,really a pretty crappy cd,"I am from Springfield Illinois and the album stocked late over here. Fortunately, I was able to pick one up in time. It was decent, but certainly nothing to rave about, i'm sorry for her. She needs to help herself with this one."
1,Remove the Fake Reviews!,"Somebody twisted my words around and cheated me and now I am posting my review again. Because it was deleted. I would like to say that this album is poorly planned and produced. Thank you, and don't try it again."
1,Poor Debut from Carrie Marie.,"A local from our town, i was hoping she'd do better than this. Since I am binded by my honesty, I will not lie and say it is good. It is not good at all, and the truth must shine through.`rev. Checotah, OK"
1,She stinks!!,"Give it up review copier!! LOL you really are a loser, you knwo that I can do this all day and night, its my job! Anyway, this CD is awesome! The best songs are Wasted, Some Hearts, and Jesus Take the Wheel."
1,OMG WOW,WOW this album just is very bad! I can't say anymore its just cookie cutter crap! I want back my money...
1,Some hearts by Cairie Underwood,"I don't think she dit aht good of a job on this here album. She sounded relly bad on some songs. I think she could do better. Anyway, good luck noxt time carrie. i like country music only when its good, she aint good enough for my linking. i don't facnyc her."
1,american idol goes country? what next,in the year 2005:american idol tries to reach country audiencesit's considered okay to sing about jesus and wear bra on the coverit's ok to not sing well as long as you look like britney spearswhat will be next?
1,Worst album i've heard in years! I hate this album!!!,Wasted gets 0 stars for me. She sounds awful and the song is reptitive. Some Hearts gets 1 star for its ugliness. Jesus Take the Wheel gets 0 stars for her being too religious. I JustCan't Live a Lie gets 0 stars for being awful! Guess what? The story goes on and onThe whole CD gets 0 stars for being the worst CD ever!!1/20
2,I was disapointed:,I really thought Carrie's first cd was going to be great.I was let down.There is not one song on here that grabs you.Well not me.Hay!I bought it.So can you!
2,Fans will love anything she puts out,"I liked only ""Jesus, take the wheel"", ""Before he cheats"", and ""Checotah"" song was okay too. Carrie covers her limited range with her head voice, sounds unpleasant and goes off on ""Wasted"". She probably just did not have enough time to experiment with the sound in a studio. ""Some Hearts"" sounded all over the place like she had not decided how to sing it yet. She did much better job with the song on Billboard Music Award show. Nothing of this matters, because Carrie has a huge following and her fans will love anything she puts out."
1,She should put more effort in.. i guess its not 100% her fault,"But the production crew really failed. I would say its probably one of the biggest wastes of money I've had. Sorry for her, I thought she would do better."
3,Great singer,SHE HAS A GREAT VOICE AND FOR ANYBODY WHO LIKE COUNTRY THIS IS THE CD FOR THEM I THINK THAT IT IS GREAT
5,Awesome,"This CD is awesome. In reading some of the reviews its quite humorous when they say she can't sing and whatever else. Here's a reality check, Martina McBride is one of the leading female vocalists of country music. I took Carries version Independence Day and Martinas version of Independence Day, put them on a Computer Program, made them play at the exact same time and guess what? You couldn't make a distinction between their voices. Anyone who can sing like Martina without the distinction CAN SING!!Some of her greats songs are: Jesus Take the Wheel, Some Hearts, Before He Cheats, and Ain't In Checoatah. The others are good, but the ones I listed really stick out on the album!"
3,Found out I am not into country,Good artist if you like the his genre....resold on ebay immediately.
4,The star Idol,This CD I found overall was good. Of course the best song was Jesus take the wheel. It had maybe two to three good songs. I felt the rest were fillers. She is a wonderful performer and singer hands down that is why she is a four star.
3,Semi Impressed,"I was hoping for a total knockout, a little disapointed on some of the songs, but I have to say some of the tracks are good. Jesus Take the Wheel is a great song, along with Wasted. The one that does stand out to me is Before he cheats and young and beautiful.Carrie definetly has a unique tone to her voice, but looking at all the IDOL winners, they all do in their own way.I basically bought this album because I am a fan of the show and support all the IDOLS. They all work hard and deserve fame.If you are a Carrie fan, definetly will like this cd."
5,If you can only buy 1 CD this year........,"......Buy Some Hearts.It is a well crafted intellectual album made by an wonderful and gifted national treasure, Carrie Underwood.Words can not express how touching this CD is.It warms the soul."
4,BEST IDOL YET,"I THINK CARRIE UNDERWOOD IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE BEST SINGER FROM AMERICAN IDOL. CARRIE IS A TRUE SINGER. BEFORE SHE WAS A SINGER SHE WAS A WAITRESS. EVERY SONG SHE SINGS IS STRONG AND MEANINGFUL. MY FAVORITE SONG ON THIS CD IS ""BEFORE HE CHEATS"" BECAUSE I LOVE WHEN GIRLS GET EVEN. I LIKE THE VIDEO FOR THAT SONG TOO. IF YOU'RE A COUNTRY MUSIC FAN I THINK YOU SHOULD GET THIS CD."
5,Bo/Con fan says good job Carrie!,"Bought this out of curiosity, always thought Carrie could sing but never thought all that much of her or her songs. Don't like country music but this was on sale so I ordered it figuring, take a chance, glad I did. This is a great great CD!! I even love the country sounding songs and Carrie is the QUEEN of the POWER BALLADS!! Good job Carrie and good luck!"
1,I don't like this one at ll,"thsi girl, she sing, shes ing boring. I don't like especially the message of before he cheats, she acts liek a vandal, that sets a bad example. I just wanted to say that I don't think this CD is right, and whoever produced it needs some help. Its awful."
1,Grow up!,My god your 28 and you're still singing about hearts and stars. You need to grow up you little girl. This stinks!
1,WOW BIG SHOCK,I thought it would be a great album! Its really not Im suprised honestly its very boring... I couldnt listen to it but one time because every song was so drab and dull.... Her voice is totally altered and amped up to try and make it sound powerfull. Being a producer in the industry its easy to spot this... Its okay if it is meant for it to be that way and its dance music but I was not expecting such boring music from this IDOL I voted for...GradeD-
1,Worst sound in my whole life,"This is really horrible. It's like an ache in my ear that never goes away. I would stay away from this boring, pathetic cd."
1,Manufactured Garbage,"This cd is to music what McDonalds is to the restaurant industry. Sure, you get it fast and all, but it's all pre-packaged and stale. Music shouldn't be like fast food. If someone wants to be a singer, they shouldn't win that right on a lame tv show. They should write songs and sing them. This sounds like some Hallmark Card writer handed her the lyrics and she just sang them and let the studio workers do their thing. If she really wanted to be a country singer, she should have written some songs and gone to Nashville like everybody else. That's the problem. She didn't write anything. It was all just handed to her.If you want to hear a good cd, check out Madonna's ""Confessions on a Dance Floor."" Now THAT is a great album!"
1,Terrible CD,I expect from an Idol winner a wide range of music. So Carrie only is focused on country songs. So she will never be an international superstar like Kelly. The songs are boring but I ordered this CD because I expected so much more.
1,Carrie's bad!!!,"I never liked her at all, even on the show. My family would annoy me by saying 'you have to admit she did this good and blah blah blah' but it didn't convince me. Now I convinced them, they agreed with me that this cd was really bad. hmmph, so I win."
1,Disgusting album,"Her rendition of the classic Some Hearts is atrocious. I hate this album, and her stuipd, antisemitist remarks in half of her songs. I'm sorry but this is just awful, and she is not exactly fun to look at anyway. Yuck, waste of money, talentless bd."
1,Ruben Still Rules...,Despite whatever anyone may say to the contrary. Ruben Studdard remains the best/most talented American Idol. Carie Underwood is ok at best !
4,Not bad,"First of all, I have to tell you I was a Bo Bice fan as far as AI goes. That being said, I am also a country music fan. This CD is pretty good. The debut track ""Jesus, Take The Wheel"" is the best song on here and I love it (so does my 5 year old). ""Before He Cheats"" is my second favorite reminiscent of ""Little Goodbyes"" by SheDaisy. Other than that, the rest of the songs are good but nothing particularly special. She has a good voice and I think she is going to do well. I think once she gets some experience under her belt she is going to be a force to be reckoned with."
5,Im Inside Her Heaven,"Carrie is an astounding singer, and to hear a recorded version of her is just like being inside her heaven. I recommend all to support the smalltown gal by buying her cds!"
2,An Overrated POP Album,"I was a fan of Carrie way back when I actually watched American Idol. I thought she could sing, and it would be interesting to see what she could come up with, music wise.First of all, Some Hearts is NOT, in any way, a country album.It is one heck of a pop album if I've ever heard one. And the lyrics are quite cliche...nothing original.Carrie can do better. I don't not like Carrie, she has potential. I just wish she'd live up to it. She calls herself a country girl, so why not make the country music she wants to make, and not let the record company take over? I looked forward to hearing an American Idol prodouce a country album, but this is just pop..."
1,wahha wahh Jesus Take the Wheel,"oh please, she cannot do any better than this? Its really bad! Oh gosh, I don't ever want to hear her boring voice again!"
1,I hate this album with a passion!!,Whoever is copying the reviews won't win because I know something they don't ;) so they should just give up. Some Hearts is the best song and the worst one is the night before. I still wouldn't get it though. It ain't good enough of an album!
1,CARRIE UNDERWOOD FAILS!!!,"Her debut album 'Some Hearts' fails to impress me in any way, shape or form. She lacks any type of uniqueness in her voice. I'm sorry but it just doesn't help.Wasted - 0/10DFTRM - 1/10Some hearts - 1/10JTTW - -5/10Night Before - 0/10Starts with Goodbye - 2/10I Just can't live a lie - 1/10"
1,Carrie's really bad!,This album didn't impress me or my family in the least bit! All she does is scream and yell!
2,Very disapointed,"I can't believe Carrie would come out with such trash. Theres only one or two good songs. The rest of them get old way fast. Don't waste your money. Just download Before He Cheats, Jesus, Take the Wheel, and I Ain't In Checotah Anymore."
1,"Horrible, it sucks!","Her debut album 'Some Hearts' is horrible! in every way, shape and form!!! She has no difference in her voice.Wasted - 0/20"
1,not impressive!!,"Carrie Underwood ceases to impress me in every on this album. Especially on track ""I just Can't Live a Lie"". It's just soooooooooo disgusting! I can't listen to it! I had high expectations and she destroyed them! horrible production and planning.. somebody is copying my review. They will go to hell!"
1,Mediocre Album,"This album is a waste of time to listen to. Everything is mediocre or way below par. The album cover is poor, the songs are poor, everything you can think of. Don't be tricked by her worshippers."
1,Did she win American Idol?,"I don't get why, because everything on this album screams ""I don't deserve to win anything"" Every song sounds very similar, so much so that i had a very hard time differenciating each song the first time I heard them. Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this."
4,James and Derek,This CD is my son's choice but it is excellent. All the American Idol finalists and winners are for the most part really good and we have been watching since series 2.
5,Brings tears of joy to my eyes......,"I can not tell you just how much bliss Carrie brings to me.She gives 150% from start to finish on this platinum disc.Don't think twice, buy the disc TODAY !"
5,terrific music by a brilliant artist!,"I love this album, she sounds terrific on this stupendous album. I love 'Some Hearts' too. I really can't wait until her second album. I liked her on American Idol and now I LOVE HER!!!"
1,A terrible album.,"I would not advise anybody to buy this, because it's a really bad album. Please don't take this advice literally, because it may hurt your feelings, just my reccomendation."
1,Its a bad album,"I feel bad saying this because I supported Carrie through American Idol, but this CD is just plain awful! Every song is similarly annoying and difficult to listen all the way through. Good luck finding a copy left because its sold very well. I'm just saying its wayy overrated."
1,can't jam to this!,"You can't jam to this kind of music,it's just cruddy repetitive music. It all sounds the same to me(Me Da Igual)"
1,"In all honesty, i'm gettin tired of people copying reviews!","This album is honestly awful! People need to stop, and just listen. Her album is similar, it is dry, it is boring. She has nothing unique about her. She sings awfully, and the songs sound so similar that it make me sick."
1,1 star for no effort at all.,"I've heard artists of all ages and genres that pour their hearts out when they sing. Do they earn the least bit of respect, no? What makes her earn anything more. Her voice is far less spectacular then the voices i've heard. Especially after seeing her perform on the CMA's I was convinced of that. The CD is just not good at all. Some Hearts is a terrible album full of confused lyrics, and poor singing. Better luck next time, Carrie Nobody."
1,Buy Kelly's Album Instead,All This girl Does is try to scream high notes and has ZERO vocal range. A ton of filler songs on this album as well.
1,I used to like her but not anymore...,I liked her on american idol and I joined her fansite. She was awful on this CD i just don't know what happened. I let some of my friends listen and they were like ... 'eww' about her all along but I never got why? Now I do..:(
1,Excellent CD!!!!!! Best I've Heard in Ages,"Carrie Underwood is great. She just needs a little bit of a better selection on her song choices. Other than that its a pretty nice and pleasant CD. I dunno, maybe she sould adapt to her surroundings better, being a small town girl. She will grow up eventually. I really liked her better with black hair though."
1,"Boring, she needs to get over herself","I don't think i've ever listened to a snobbier album in my life. She's so stuck up, and I hate the song ""Jesus, Take the Wheel"" It is so redpointed(if you know what I mean?) Get over it Carrie Dunderwood, you can't sing!"
3,Bo fan knows it is good,But I am cancelling my order to you as your editoral writer shows she is very insenstive. Enjoy your music Carrie fans. I will enjoy my Bo music from another source.
1,Soulless!!!!,"just like her performances on American Idol. No depth, no heart (despite the title). Over produced country pop drivel. Where is the emotion in her voice? Wait she has not lived yet for there to be any."
4,Very good for a new star like Carrie Underwood..,"every song is very nice..i love Jesus, Take The Wheel and Before He Cheats the most.."
5,Comin' to your CD player!,Just go get it... this is one of the best CD's I own. You can't go wrong getting this one!
5,Great Debut for a Wonderful Young Lady,I'm actually not believing some of these pathetic 1 star reviews from fans of others from Idol. Heck they're even so bold as to admit it or you look at their past reviews and you can put two and two together and see why they would do something so childish. Is it insecurity? I wonder. What a sad world this is.Now on to Carrie...what a wonderful debut! There are great things happening for this young lady. Something she worked very hard for. There was not one song I did not LOVE on this CD!
1,Carreokie,"If you want bad kareoke music then listen to this boring overwrought horrific mishmash of pretense. It's one glob of pathetic production and screaming vocals. The girl needs to get a vocal coach to stop screaming. She is responsible for all the muting that went on last season on American Idol. Her voice just pierces your ears and makes them hurt. Why record a cd when you are generic, run of the mill and boring? Who would want it? I can't believe some Carriemaniac bought 50 of these and insisted on giving me one. I listened and I had to throw the cd out instead of inflicting it on someone else.Just awful.And all you little kiddies out there trying to prove a point? Amazon doesn't do hardly any of the major sales. They are a drop in the bucket. So go ahead and slam Kelly and Clay and the rest. Or maybe just get to bed."
