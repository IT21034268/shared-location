4,Classic movie of good Mexico-US relations,"Well, I just watched The Border Incident with a young Ricardo Montalban. 1940ish, black and white. No explosions or sex. Good tension... you really don't know how it is going to end. Great cooperation between Mexican and US authorities in working to stop illegal immigration. US folk exploiting Mexican workers are the bad guys for a change. Watched at the Movie Museum in Honolulu, a 16 seat theater with 16 reclining chairs. Nice!"
5,the last book you will need,"This book is all you will ever need to finish a great guitar, don`t waste time looking elsewhere it`s all here. It`s detailed and comprehensive on all the different stages and products to use and alternatives.(as they say) Highly Recommended."
5,great book,love this book. i work on all my guitars. This book is full of useful info. great addition to my library
4,This is WAY overpriced.,"I don't understnad how these sellers are charging almost twice as much for used copies of this book as StewMac is charging for brand new copies.. Seems bizarre.. Get it together, Amazon!!"
3,Careful Little Fingers,"The fabric color is beautiful & so comfortble on the heel & ankle; the cushioning is cushy! The height is just right to work with its companion rocker/glider & the magnetized hideaway stool feature is nice for nursing moms who don't want a gliding ottoman all the time. HOWEVER, since this is a fun place for a toddler boy to throw himself and pretend he is flying, caution must be exercised! This ottoman & its matching glider/rocker have exposed parts that can pinch & dangerously harm a toddler. If you are the parent of an only-child infant, you might not have considered the future with this piece of furniture. I am the parent of an infnat AND a toddler who has pinched himself in this ottoman--and hard. Yikes! Wish, now, I had gone with a fully covered model in both rocker/glider & ottoman. Moving parts are too fascinating to curious preschoolers!! It's Physics Lesson Numero Uno for my boy, anyway."
2,College Pro math,"Very dry.. Runs with quicktime which is an older viewer with bug *lots of bugs*. Worked for 2 weeks on XP, then I got internal error message and hardly any support from staff, so far.not recommended."
3,Needlessly complicated,"Diane Fallon is a forensic anthropologist heading up a forensic lab in Georgia. Diane is called on to investigate discovery of three hanging corpses in the woods. There are many more deaths in the course of this novel including the two land surveyors who initially found the corpses. One of the main problems I had with this book was not only the abundance of victims, but the sheer volume of characters. It made the story line feel very cluttered. It all sort of tied together at the end, but overall this book felt like a lot of work to read."
2,false advertising,"This is not the anniversary set, as Amazon proclaims. It does not have any special gold colored bricks and does not come in the anniversary tub (gold and black). If you really want the anniversary set, don't buy this one! Also, this set did not have any vehicle pieces, no people, and no pieces for building houses (no doors or windows). My son was disappointed by this so I had to go to the Lego website and order extra pieces to supplement it. I would only recommend this if you want to add bricks to your existing lego collection. Not a great starter set."
5,Yum!,"These are great... Really bad for you, but wonderful.They call these ""Double Chocolate"" but they should really be called quadruple or quintuple chocolate, because they have a coating of 2 types of chocolate, chocolate cake, chocolate cream filling, and chocolate syrup drizzled inside."
2,Infomative but incredibly badly written...,"Well, as a CNC student, I had to take a course in Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing, with this as a required book.My main comment would be that there is an incredibly small amount of organization, there are no chapters and the book is laid out in a manner that confuses the industry workers and the engineers alike.There is also a workbook and answer book that are usually used with the book, but are self-published by the author himself so good luck finding one.I'd recommend getting the ""real"" asme Y14.5M book despite it's cost."
5,More Good Music,I have enjoyed all the Armik CDs that I have bought and cannot pick one over the other. They are all good and I recommend them to anyone who enjoys Spanish guitar.
1,This isn't Flame with Jimmy Crespo and Marge Raymond,"This is a different band! I have the cd and it is not the RCA signed band who put out 2 albums back in '77 and '78. It's another band completely, this release is from 1992. Don't waste your money if that's actually what you're looking for, the original Flame's albums have only been put out on vinyl (as of 2010)!"
5,HOT! HOT! HOT!,"I was flipping channels the other day and saw this total babe cooking on Good Morning America"" so I stopped to watch. I'm a bachelor and don't really cook much, but it sounded like I might be able to do this stuff...and I can! And it rocks! I've already made the Big Mac 3 times in the last 2 days. I'm addicted!"
1,A lot of these recipes are not good for people who are trying to lose weight.,"I just received this book today in the mail. While I was going through this book, I found that a lot of the recipes are not good for people who are trying to watch their weight. This book may be good for people who are interested in finding alternatives to fast food places. In my mind, fast food is still fast food!!!! no matter how someone makes it. I also find a lot of the recipes high in calories. I find that this book can create real trouble for people who are on a serious path to losing weight. Temptation is an evil thing when you are trying to lose weight. All in all, not a good book for people who are trying to make recipes and eatting for weight lose."
3,Tastes real- takes forever!,"We have tried many of the recipes in the cookbook and have found most of them taste like they were made at a fast food restaturant. The only problem, you don't get the ""fast"" service. The majority of the recipes take half and hour or more to prepare. Also, the Dairy Queen brownies are awful."
3,"Not thrilled, but I hope I can make it useful in the future.","I always feel that if I can find one reciipe in a cookbook that I can use, it is a good cookbook. I found one I will use."
5,Healthy Cookbook,"Love Good food Fast, lotsa easy to do recipes, making healthy foods easy to make.Full of flavor and making healthy cooking easy.Excellent"
5,A must have for fast food junkies!,"If you love fast food this amazing book is a true must have. Full of recipes that mimic the ""secret sauces"" and trademark spices of your favorite fast food, this book provides relatively easy to follow instructions for recreating everything from Big Macs and McDonalds Fries to Cinnabuns. While not all recipes are simple or fast, many such as KFC's popcorn chicken, can be made in advance and flash fried when needed. The goal of the book is to provide a reduced fat version of fast food favorites and on this level it certainly succeeds. Most recipes taste are virtually indistinguishable from the version that comes out of the drive through window. The only real downside is that the recipes are designed for a single serving. While most meals are supposed to take 30 minutes or less to prepare, you will need to have to have basic to intermediate cooking skills and even then the 30 minute guideline can be a bit ambitious."
2,It's the same ingredients for most everything....,"This had to have been the easiest cookbook to ever write. The ingredients for some of these recipes are basically the same but just switched around or chicken instead of beef, etc. Some of the recipes are so darn simple, you could have figured it out with your eyes closed (one recipe calls for roast beef and a sesame seed bun...that's all!) Total waste of money, I would not recommend this book."
5,Fast Food Fix,Book arrived in excellent condition; content of the book was even better than I hoped; I am enjoying it very much.
3,No Pictres,Recipes are good did try the chick n fill chicken tenders. turn out pretty good. recipes are easy to follow. Just wish it had pictures. I like pictures in my recipe books. I sometimes buy recipe books just because I like the pictures it makes me want to try the recipes. All in all the recipes are pretty simple and the ingridents are available. Would have given this book a higher rating if it had pictures.
1,Stay away,"This kettle is absolutely beautiful, but to use it you must take off the protective layer. After doing that it looked much less appealing. I also did not like that the spout was a different material. Other stores have better options, but they do cost more."
3,Old Dutch tea kettle,"This product I like but it is a little small , my other kettle is 3 quart, this copper clad kettle is okay for now,I'm aiming for a solid Copper inside and out, and large capacity - 3 quart or more, hey I can only dream."
2,Copper tea pot,This copper tea pot was kind of cheap looking. I was disappointed. Now if I could only find information on getting a refund.
4,Certainly worth more than a penny,"Few people have heard of him, and that's a shame, because he's got some nice stuff here. Tracks like ""Together"", ""Love Controversy"", and ""What In The World Can Change Your Mind"", are nice pieces of earthy, midtempo soul."
3,lack of control,"The Maxon distortion pedal sounds excellent, with a choice of overdrive or fuzz and a wide range of effect levels. The EQs are excellent. It's a bit noisy, and the built-in noise suppressor is only of so much help. Also, there is no separate control for the volume boost. You hit the second switch and you get a boost that is quite dramatic at low gain levels, much less so at high gain. I've managed to find an acceptable compromise setting and the pedal sounds quite good, but I do wish for more control over noise and the boost."
1,"Same ole, same ole",The sexual exploits of an alchoholic undertaker are the focus of all of Tim Cockney's Hitchcock Sewell mystery novels. All one has to do if interested in any kind of mystery/murder storyline is to skip to the last 6 or so pages and read the plot synopsis ala Agatha Christe. The rest of the book is fluff.
5,KILLER STORY,"If you haven't been introduced to Hitchcock Sewell, unwitting part-time detective and suave full-time undertaker, choose any of Mr. Cockey's 5 books at random. You won't be disappointed. His characters rock along in tales that are quirky, frisky, and light. And, hey, along the way you'll learn some interesting trivia to share about the secret life of embalmers. How many books give you that?"
4,Decent,"Blended wool, that means there's fine acrylic fibers in there too. It's for buffing final coats. It's super soft, like pillow stuffing almost if that gives you an idea of what kind of pad it is. It's backed by ridged cloth.Hope that helps."
1,Warning: Buyer Beware,"If you are collecting this series of books by Cathy Hopkins, this book is the same book as Mates, Dates and and Designer Divas, but with a different title."
1,The down side,"I think that Underground to Canada was a good book and was written very well. However there were also many bad things about this book. There was the seperation of families which is a very sad theme. an example of this is when willy is nipped from his mother and he's only a little baby boy. Julilly is also taken away from her mom when she is very young. When this book first came out there was a protest. This protest was about the language used in this novel. There were many people who protested against the use of ""nigger"". It was used in very raicist terms and upset many people. Once Sim's said ""get back to work you stupid nigger girl."" Even if that's how people were at times it might incourage people now to speak the same way."
5,"edgy, raw and captivating","This album is unlike anything you would expect in pop music nowadays. The engaging, raw vocals are a break from the wimpy offerings of the whining multitudes. Earnest and authentic blues based guitar work drives the clever arrangements home, and often leaves you feeling like you've walked down a new corridor in a house youve been in many times. A worthy listen if you ever enjoyed REAL blues music, and would like to hear the clock cranked back with a very modern edge."
4,Great classic blues sound,"Heard ""Psychic Blues"" on the radio , this afternoon, and thought it was an undiscovered Howlin Wolf, or Muddy Waters tune. Amazon, as usual, has every obscure or hard to find title I've ever looked for , and it will be great to hear the rest of this cd."
1,false advertising,this cd is not by a band with danny kortchmer on guitar and harvey brooks on bass. brooks plays on only two songs. this is programmed music with weak songs. brooks remains one of the best living bass players but buy anything else he appears on before wasting your money on this.
3,New Jack Swing Gospel Style,"If you're a christian and or a fan of the New Jack Swing era, then you will like this album, these brothers have some of the strongest disticnt voices of the era itself. The stand out track is Angel, other good tracks are Someone's Praying for You and the title track Devotion (not sure what member of the group it is, but he defintley worked hard on this track, he hit some-what Prince type notes, very nice) this is a pretty solid debut album, and I would suppose the biggest reason it is forgotten is because, Giant Records went bankrupt soon after this release, and signed groups such as Co.Mpany and Jade were left with nada. This was not a success back in the 90's, but again this was a gospel album, and it may have been harder to promote a gospel new jack swing group, to either of the two genres it was, still worth the less than 7$ you will pay to have it in your collection. This is gospel you can do the latest dance 2 or atleast the good ole dance moves from the era lol"
5,sweet book,"""Mother, Please Don't Die"", written by Lurlene McDaniel, is an entertaining and well-written novel. The McCaffery family faces many controversies due to Mrs. McCaffery's health condition. In dealing with her mother's condition, Megan still proceeds with her everyday sports activities but does everything she can to keep her mother alive. Megan's siter, Audrey, is anxiously waiting for her wedding day but is afraid her mother will not make it to see her get married. The McCaffery girls bicker incessantly, which makes it harder for their mother to relax, and in the end, they find themselves closer than ever before. McDaniel has an amazing way with words and makes her reading fun and entertaining. She uses descriptive and precise words, and they are easy to understand. In this novel, she createst a vivid picture in my mind on every page. ""Mother, Please Don't Die"" has turned out to be one of my favorite books, and I would definitely read another book by McDaniel."
2,defective,we were able to get 5 cleanings and it should give 50 cleanings. I am going to return the tape and hope the other 2 tapes work well.
2,Buy the single CD instead,"It's Bob so it gets stars there but that's about it. I don't think Bob is even in the videos. I watched it like 4 years ago and never watched it again. I sold it actually. I'm not that guy who owns 2 Bob Marley albums, I have about 40 CDs and box sets, books, posters, magnets, shirts, underwear (wait, no underwear). Save your money. Actually, buy the CD for the music because you have to."
1,Misleading photograph,"WARNING! Despite the pictured item above (with its OS X icon), Amazon ships the Windows version of this product. If that's what you're after, you'll be fine (presumably). If you're after the OS X version, search for a supplier that correctly labels software with its requirements.1 star 'cause the shipped item won't run for dammit on my powerbook. Shame on Amazon for misleading advertising."
4,The little wagon that could,"Hi,I bought the wagon to give to my wife so she could have a happy wagon like the one in the book ""Star Girl"" by Jerry Spinelli. So it sits on her desk with somewhere between 1 and 20 pebbles in it. Its doing a great job as a pebble holder. Not a single pebble has escaped. Its well made, very cute, and she really liked it."
5,Hinduism Simplified,"Well written and well illustrated book on Hinduism for those who want an overview. Being an author of ""Hinduism Simplified"" myself, I am aware of the difficulties of writing a brief overview of a rich and the oldest religion that is still preserved. We need more such authors. Congratulations Ms Jagannathan. Anupkumar Shetty www.ThirdEyeMeditation.com"
4,Junior High Memories!,"'Never Satisfied' was and still is the jam! The album is pretty good,early 90's r&b/hip hop. They were very talented! I wish they would of stayed around longer. Check it out."
3,90's R&B girl group,"I had been looking for this on c.d. for ages to replace my old cassette. I went to cosmetology school with one of the girls in the group and remember her missing school here and there for the recording sessions. For the most part, cheesy R&B, but ""Romance You"" is a standout love ballad that makes this worth the entire price"
3,Very Mainstream,If you are thinking old Drop Kick then you will not like it. It is good but very mainstream. Looking for video soon on MTV2?
5,move over LIMP BIZKIT,You have know idea what you are missing. This CD should be handed out to every kid in america so they can learn what it means to rock!
3,"OK product, though flawed","This item is decent quality, especially given the price. However, I've got some concerns...- It's small. You can't put more than 1 or 2 kinds of cheese on it. I knew ahead of time from the posted dimensions, but it seems even smaller in person.- When it rotates open, the top part has nothing to rest on, and its an inch or so off the table surface, so its not practical to use as shown in the picture unless you put something under it so it doesn't see-saw every time you slice some cheese. In fact, the cynic in me believes that the fruit in the picture is strategically placed so its harder to see the see-saw flaw. See?Bottom line is that it works, but not going to win any awards."
4,"Cheap, but a decent deal","The cutting board is solid and usefulI wanted this mostly for the tools. The cheese shaver was important.The tools metal are very thick, and not vented. The shaver slices too thick for striping thin wax.For the price I'll adapt."
3,Circo Cheese set,"Liked the concept, a good package, fun to use, not very expensive. It would be a good grab bag gift."
3,"Handy, but you can't rinse off!","I like this for the occasional cheese and crackers snack (or even just using the knives), or especially for taking out for picnics. It is a little unnerving that this cannot be rinsed under water - like my bamboo cutting boards - to clean it thoroughly. You can only use a damp cloth to clean the surface. If I used this more often, I would be more concerned. Otherwise, I'm considering this purchase OK and would prefer a more ""livable"" item for my use in the future."
5,You can't put it down!,"It's rare that I find a book I can't put down, but I couldn't help myself with Project Death. It is such a compelling story that I found myself saying, ""just a few more pages ...""As Bertematti's Tito Rico recounts his story of murder and police corruption, one can't help becoming engrossed in the novel. So eager was I to learn more of Tito's story that I didn't even pause at the end of a chapter before delving into the next.Snappy dialogue, vivid descriptions and Bertematti's crisp writing style keep ""Project Death"" moving at a pace so delightfully fast that there was barely time for me to stop and catch my breath. I can't wait to read more books from this author!"
3,Cord reel was DOA,"The stampings are very nice, but the internal attachment point for the large rewind spring was broken, allowing the spring to slip with a loud braaaap noise. The cord wouldn't retract at all.The reel has a lifetime warranty, though, so hopefully a return will be easy.I would have given this reel five stars except for the functional defect."
4,Helpful tool,Gave this to my son in law for Christmas. He loved it and was anxious to put it to use. He thinks it will be really helpful.
5,Great device,"Needed to find the center of a bedroom ceiling to install a overhead light. Since I live alone, I had no one to help me hold a regular tape measure to the ceiling. So I investigate other measuring device options and found the Strait-line 300 rolling tapeto be a good choice. Works great. Got the job done in less than five minutes. Tip - Save yourself some bucks, this device can be found at Home Depot for $20 dollars."
3,This is Not a Precision Instrument.,"This is not a precision instrument. Use it for rough estimates only. It is good for what all of the other 9 reviewers used it for, however, it can be off as much as a half inch. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with my unit, other than I get varying measurements. If the measurements were at least consistent, then it wouldn't matter what the numbers were, but I measured the same wall 6 times and got 6 different results. Like I said, if you are just hanging shelves or pictures and want them evenly spaced, or even if you want to find the center of the ceiling, this unit will work as long as you don't mind that it will be a little off. If you are making the shelves yourself, use a tape measurer."
1,Good only if you don't cook with tomatoes!,"Though this mat is durable and thin, I am unable to get tomato stains out of it with comet or even diluted bleach. As a result, it has splotches of orange that do not look good against the white sink."
4,A fascinating blend of fantasy and history,"Suspend your logic for a trip into a magical world with The Adept series. Yes, Kurtz and Harris make good use of just enough historical fact to maintain plausibility, while adding a good dose of fantastical magic for a wonderful read. While The Templar Treasure may not contain enough fact for fans of that bygone order, it does contain some reasonably accurate description of Qabalistic ritual. I am certain that either Kurtz or Harris are familiar enough with the Golden Dawn tradition to have fashioned their psychic detective in similar tradition. A delightful read."
5,Tammy Rocks!,"I had the pleasure of meeting Tammy a few times, and she's awesome! I can't help but say that, but in addition to having great music, she's a great lady too. The music on this album is terrific, as was her debut album, and the new one (Set You Free) is sure to be a cut above the rest once again. Tammy has the ability to make people listen, even if you don't like Christian music( just ask my friend Jessie!). Her energy on and off stage is inspiring, and her music has always been, and always will be the best in any music anywhere. The new album is set to be released June 20th from Sparrow records... in my opinion, you should buy this! It will be a great addition to your collection, and well worth your money."
2,Not that great,Despite the high praise heaped on this stud finder by some reviewers this stud finder is not that great (some reviews must be written by the manufacturer). The directions are poorly written and the device is unreliable. I found it difficult to use and no better than others. Look elsewhere for a single purpose device.
5,Great buy!,"I used this to install surround sound speakers and had no issues.I first tried it on several walls around the house. It found wooden studs, metal studs as well as AC wiring easily. It gives a clear visual indication on the large LCD display as well as a beeping sound.I was specially concerned about AC wiring but it detects it without any problems, something the magnet based stud finders cannot do.Strait-Line was also offering a 10 dollar mail-in rebate on all of its products on its website (no matter where you buy) which was not listed on Amazon's website, so check Strait-Line's site too before you buy."
1,no better than the others,"I've tried a number of different stud finders in different price ranges and from different manufacturers. This one worked no better than the others, which in a word is awful. It will ""identify"" a stud location on one pass and give no indication over that same location on the next pass. So if you don't mind playing ""guess where the stud is"" and punching multiple holes in your wall you'll love this baby."
2,Average product,Not very reliable. You have to try a few times before you can be sure that the locate you got is the right one. Push pin type marker is novel and useful.
1,"Same song, another verse !!",I was terribly disappointed with this wall scanner. It doesn't find studs any better than the other two I own. This one is a pain to use and I cannot recommend it.
3,Wishful Thinking,"It's too bad that the original ""Billy and the Beaters"" album is not available on CD - I've been searching for years as my original LP is wearing. It's been one of my favorite albums since 1982 but is about worn out..."
1,At This Moment,"This CD was not even near what I expected. The original cassette tape of the same title has the original cut's including hopeless romantic (the CD DID NOT) the sound quality was no where the original. Very obvious a ""dubbed"" cut. Bad quality = bad purchase= returned item."
5,Love My Maneki Neko,"This little, cute, fat cat bank is sitting on my tv stand for all to see when they come over and I'm very happy with this purchase."
5,"Cute Kitty, Great story!","I love the Maneki Neko story, that of a Japanese princess whose beloved cat was killed while saving her from a poisenous viper.This is a sweet, well made little staue that is worth the small price charged."
5,Great speakers!,I used these speakers for my remodel for my whole house audio system and these speakers were by far the best quality for the price. Unfortunately Rodin Audio bought out Phoenix Gold so I am having a really hard time getting these speakers. I'm not sure if Rodin has discounted the Phoenix Gold in home line for the Audio Source (another company Rodin owns) home line but these are almost impossible to find. I did find another speaker branded OSD Audio ICE640 which is identical to the ATC6 and finished the remodel with those. I hope they did not actually stop making these because these are some of the best in ceiling speakers I have installed in any remodel for their price.
4,Good value,For the price these speakers can't be beat. I use these for music throughout my house. Plain and simple. Be careful taking the covers off for installation. I will be purchasing two more sets.
3,Good bang for the buck,They work and they sound decent. Great for whole house sound at a price that does not require you to take out a second mortgage.
2,The specs are misleading,"I purchased these speakers after reading positive reviews, hoping that they would live up to the specifications. They do look decent with gold-plated spring-loaded connectors. However, basic testing with wide-gamut music such as Erykah Badu showed that they lack both the bass and the treble. The sound quality is very similar to what you get with the standard (not premium) car speakers. Note that the claimed frequency response of 40 Hz -20 kHz does not specify the dB rating. In other words, these numbers do not in any way characterize how the sound output at 20 kHz compares to 1 kHz. I ended up returning the speakers. Maybe I am spoiled by my old floor-standing four-way Panasonics and three-way Technics..."
5,Best Value - Excellent sound,"I bought these to use mainly for background music in my newly finished basement. They were so easy to install, just cut out the circle with a sheetrock saw using the template provided, stuff insulation in the whole, push in the speaker and tighten 4 screws that open the mounting legs inside the hole and you're done. I connected my receiver and CD player to the 2 speakers I installed in my 15' x 15' room and I was shocked by how good the sound was. You could hear all the highs and no subwoofer required - the bass was amazing on these. As an added bonus they even allow you to move the tweeter in the center of the speaker and ""direct"" the sound any way you want. This is especially useful if you don't want all the sound blaring straight down on your head if you have a couch under the speaker as I do. So there you go - at around $40 per pair you can't beat these."
1,Bitched Out,"Simplistic, trite, degrading to all who have struggled with this issue. To call it comedy is to call Schindler's List comedy. Rent the movie it is a higher seller than this tragedy of penmanship and 10th grade art."
3,Ok,"Not as good as the other books I've read by this author, but still readable.Willingham is good at dialogue, even though it gets a little long-winded at times in this novel.Ending a bit enigmatic, who (character) wrote the narrative?If anyone has read, and knows, drop a line."
4,Worth reading just for Smoky Joe,"I bought this book because Angell has an account of going to a college baseball game with 1912 Red Sox pitcher, Smoky Joe Wood. Angell and Wood sit in the stands, talk baseball (and life) and watch future star Ron Darling pitch a nailbiter.The rest of the book is a little drawn out but Angell remains one of the most gifted baseball writers of his generation."
4,Intriguing Novel of Ideas,"We can only hope that Powers can one day surpass his wonderfully brilliant Gold Bug variations, but this may be his second best book. The romantic strands and existential depth of this work are more like Gold Bug than that more intellectual, analytic and distanced treatments of Galatea and Gain. There is a real humanity to this book, while the characters struggle with the meaning of life, especially one life, swimming in (or against) the tide of history.Powers is not for all tastes because he engages one at the level of ideas (as well). But if you like that stuff, I'd first get Gold Bug, but then I'd choose this."
2,"Good Writer, Story Tough to Follow","I recently finished reading Powers' first novel, ""Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance"", and liked it enough that I decided to try some of his other work.Prisoners' Dilemma is a very complex novel. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I felt that the characters were the book's main strength - they are rich, conflicted and masterfully crafted. However, especially toward the end, I got totally lost. I could not follow the story.The first 100 pages or so were engaging and interesting, but the novel kept getting stranger, until at the end I was no longer sure what was going on. It could be that I am not as sophisticated a reader as I should be, but if you are like me, be aware that this book is a tough one to follow.Powers can craft a masterful sentence, and his prose is really great. My problem was that all this great prose never turns into a great story, for me at least."
2,Not half as good as its predecessor,"Of the four shorts on this DVD, only one Alkali, Iowa, is worth seeing. The other three have none of the emotional resonance of the three short stories of the first Boys Life trilogy. The acting in Must Be The Music was pathetic and the story almost non-existent. Nunzio's Second Cousin also lacked a purpose, and The DadShuttle was simply annoying. Rent this to see Alkali, Iowa but I wouldn't recommend wasting money buying it. I was disappointed."
3,What happened to the Trevor short?,"When I saw this collection at the theater, I would have sworn that it included the award-winning Trevor! Why did they remove it from the DVD release? Comments welcome!"
2,Rent it save some money!,"The moive was good, what little there was, short doesn't begin to describe the length of each story. The film left me wanting to see a lot more, when can we expect to see the rest of these films? My plea to the directors, finsh them please. Each film could easily be a full length production. Oh well, they were good, I'm greedy I guess. I bought 1 too, so I need to sit down and watch it too."
1,"Gary Palmer, give me a break","I've seen and own both Boys Life and Boys Life 2. You know what they say about sequels? The second one always bites. Same holds true here. There IS one shining moment in this terrible movie... ""The Dadshuttle"".Gary Palmer's reviews of both Boys Life and Boys Life 2 are pathetic, longwinded nonsense. Boy's Life 2 is worth the rent, but not the full ticket price. I recommend the original."
2,Expensive and too bizarre,We felt that the stories (except one of them) were far away from 'boys life (1)' and too bizarre. The surrealistic component was too strong for our taste. The stories miss the freshness and positive humor the ones in 'boys life (1)' have. We would NOT buy it again. The high price is not justified.
4,"A Varied Quartet, with One Subtle Sleeper","In 3 of these 4 shorts, homophobia lurks. All 4 are artistic, from minimal-realistic to episodic. MUST BE THE MUSIC: It's only four young teen guys going clubbing one night, scrappy and bopping. Business as usual with young males, but these prowlers are all gay--showing we're ""different and the same."" SECOND COUSIN: the tables turned, a New York cop makes a gay-basher come home for dinner at mother's. The subtlety? Residual internalized homophobia. ALKALI, IA: The film's jolty uneven flashback style well suits its subject, a farm boy discovering his father was gay, and his family is still anti-gay. But the best is THE DADSHUTTLE. Apparently only the conversation between guy and dad in a car drive, actually it's artistic genius, re-creating (not just reporting) son's attempt to communicate, father's non-intended awkwardness. Bravo."
3,Almost As Good As the First Time....,"Ok. This is a compilation of 4 short films which are all focusing on being young and gay. This set of films includes the exceptional story The Dadshuttle by Tom Donaghy, a haunting and poignant drama of a young man coming out to his father while in a car; Alkali, Iowa by Mark Christopher, a serious drama of a young rural man accepting his homosexuality; Must Be the Music by Nickolas Perry, a tale of 4 teenage friends out on the town in L.A.; and the smart and funny Nunzio's Second Cousin by Tom DeCerchio about a gay detective who gets his unusual revenge on a young gay-basher. You will laugh out loud!"
4,"My father, was he one of us?","None of the 4 shorts on display are bad, but MUST BE THE MUSIC isn't very inspired, just 4 teenagers out clubbing and that's it. THE DADSHUTTLE is OK, featuring a conversation about mundane things between a father and son. Lots of words left unspoken there. Too long, though.The standouts are ALKALI, IOWA, a novelettish subject worthy of Checkov given subtle treatment by Mark Christopher. NUNZIO'S SECOND COUSIN is an actor's dream, Vincent D'Onofrio hamming it up something wonderful as a gay Chicago cop out cruising, being harassed by gaybashers. Eileen Brennan as his chatty Italian mamahas a jolly old time, as well.This is worth buying, for ALKALI, IOWA alone."
3,Nice sleeves....but cant handle the load,"Well i loved it once it got here, filled it up without a problem....only issue is the handle broke off like within a couple days. They didn't design it with a heavy load in mind and should of used another form of a handle. Besides the handle breaking, I really liked the design and the sleeves inside. I also like how it splits it into 4 sections giving u a way to separate certain discs. Overall I was disappointed with the product, but for the price you get what you pay for I guess. Good Price, but fell short on the quality."
5,It's gonna take a miracle,"I love the voices of the Royaletts.I remember the summer of 1965 hearing,It's gonna take a Miracle.A Great slow jamsong.When i hear this recording it bringsback so many memories of the good old days.The Royaletts had it going on baby!"
4,jury still out on this one,We bought this to replace an old faucet that leaked. We didn't want to replace the sink and this was the only faucet we found that would fit the old sink. The price is very good and it looks nice but not elegant. The brand name was a plus. It installed easily and everything felt sturdy and well made. The spray works nice and the faucet control was silky smooth in operation at first. after a few months use it recently became stiffer when moving the lever. I contacted Kohler and they are sending a new cartridge since it has a lifetime gaurantee and they are standing behind their product. I will install it and see what happens. I hope it's a one time thing but I suspect it may be soap scum or minerals from the water getting into the lever mechanism. I'll let you know how it works in a few months.
5,Excellent extension cord,"Tuff sheath, sealed ends, heavy gauge conductors support high amp power tools. The receptical end has an LED indicator that illuminates when the cord is powered. Maintained flexibility in moderately cold environments, well sealed for moist damp areas (use a ground fault!) this is a quality extension cord for those using higher amperage tools and equipment you wont find a better one anywhere."
5,Heavier gauge = more power!,"Unlike the less expensive extension cords that are 14 or 16 guage, this one is 12 guage. This important aspect allows you to draw 20 amps of current to opperate your favorites tools without overheating the cord. Remember to plug it into a 20 amp outlet and you'll be able to utilize the the heavier gauge cord for what it was designed for."
1,the lou rawls show,"the picture quilty is very bad . I strongly do not reconmend this dvd to anybody.Also the sound qualty is very bad.This dvd is trash.don""t wasst your time or money"
4,Great Archive of A Great Singer,"This is highly enjoyable, especially if you are a fan... Really dated skits cracked me up (late 60's/early 70's flower power!), but the Man is in fine voice. A collector's item. 10+ stars for Lou, 4 for this DVD."
5,Keep it up Jessie Haas!,"This is a good horse stpry. It is about Harriet Gibson (Harry) and her two year old colt; a Morgan who is called Kid.When Harry's mother dies of a bad heart or from a riding accident with her mare Belle, spirited Harry has to go and live with her stern Aunt Sarah, and her Uncle Clayton. While her guardian/doctor, Dr. Vesper sells her old house she chooses top bring along two big carpet bags filled with her clothes, an unbroekn 2 year old colt, and her mother's sewing Machine. Harry thinks she will have bad luck there but she soon makes friends with her uncle Clayton's brother Truman and his old thiry year old horse, jerry and begains leading a farming life. Different from her Town Life. Harry continues living there, occasionally trying to break in Kid. When she drove him hard using forse she learns a lesson.Nevertheless this is a good book!:)"
4,Good book to save your time for looking the favorite song,"I love this book. It allowed me to play some classical song that i loved and it's hard to find. They are all in one little book. However, 'cause it's "" a little book"" so it's hard to read. They should make it clearer for readers. I""m looking forward the new edition for adding more songs. Good book for saving time to find stuffs you like."
5,Works for me.,"This is my second digital recorder and I'm very happy with it. My first one,(from radio shack) was barely audible even turned all the way up but this one is very loud and clear. It even records clearly in noisy rooms. I'd recommend this recorder since it records and sounds perfect."
4,Nice little recorder to have,"I used this recorder alot, I have alot of classes,and the playback is good, it has little folders where if you recorded on one section rather than worrying that you haven't listened yet you can move to the next folder and record. The sound quality is good, 36h record time which can be broken up to folders. The only thing when you are recording make sure tht you adjust the volume, i forgot to turn the volume alittle higher and the recording was low,and that goes vice versa as well,. Nice little easy to maneuver recorder without having to be overwhelmed with the buttons."
3,A real pain in the you-know-what,"I've had this recorder for a number of months now, and I'm using it to recorder interviews that I am using for my thesis. While the recording quality itself is fairly good, I am extremely irritated that the buttons themselves aren't really set up very well. For example, I am transcribing the interviews, and so I am constantly replaying parts of the recording. If you don't press the button exactly in the right spot, you end up, instead of forwarding backward or ahead, going all the way to the beginning of the track and losing your spot. For obvious reasons, this can be extremely infuriating. I've had it do this a good 20 times at least, and then have to try to find where I was. It's caused a loss of efficiency that I think is unacceptable.So, if you don't mind inefficiency and having to spend a lot of time forwarding and going back and subsequently losing your spot, then it's great."
5,great recorder,"i never owned a digital recorder, but was pleasantly surprised by this product's 1) price 2) ease of use 3) amt of recordable hrs 4) folder system 5) size (tiny!). i don't have a basis of comparison but i am very happy with the purchase, and use it a lot."
4,voice recorder,"Being as this is my first digital voice recorder, i really have nothing to compare it with. However this unit is well suited to all the taskes I'd hoped it would be. It has, after a few short weeks become a regular member in my daily pocket. Thanks Olympus."
3,Good single but some repitition between singles,"I hate it when singles overlap and this is the case with this one. living in aus it is a good single to have but these b sides are also found on other releases of both pounding and caught by the river!!as ive said in another review, cedar room live is bad in parts with the bass but here it comes has no such issues. hit the ground running is very uptempo and will make you happy.I suggest getting the japanese pounding cd to get these songs and more"
3,Good for beginners,"This was, in some moment, the only mosaic book that I had. It has different projects, everyone is possible to do by your own. If you follow the instructions, you can do it. It has great photos and explanations.The book starts with a brief history on mosaic, next, materials and tools. It explain that exist different techniques but all the projects used the direct method. Almost twenty projects follow. Each includes basic step-by-step instructions with some photos of the result. A large photo of the finished piece is also included.The designs are not what I was expected, someones are to simply, they give you alternatives in the use of color for each project.Is a good book, but you'll need more than this one after the first project, because after that, you'll need some book that give you concepts of design and how to create by your own.I recomended that you follow with ""Classic Mosaic"" by Elaine M. Goodwin, an excellent book, the projects are more complex."
5,Great value!,"Great value for the money, it comes with 5 CDs that really helped me for my exams (nice video, audio and animation features too). The information is well organized, easy to follow, and hits many sore points for economics students, micro and macroeconomics, as well as statistics. It's nice that it has self test areas, so one can easily evaluate where they stand. Get it, you'll definitely use it!"
5,Love It,This item is very nice i ordered the 30 Inch and it came out just as i expected and it is new and shiny.
5,A pleasant surprise,"This is a truly beautiful silver necklace. The links are heavy and have an exceptionally lovely design. The silver is bright and showy. I think this is a bargain at the price paid. Of the several birthday gifts I bought for my wife, some quite a bit more expensive, this is her favorite."
3,NICE PIECE - BUT ............,"Beautiful chain, but the clasp broke after two days. We returned the chain and are awaiting for it to be fixed or a new chain in its place."
4,Good CD Player,"The thing is small and is backlit so u can see what track it is in the dark. It also came with some huge stero headphones that I like alot, but I would rather not use on the go. The volume can seem a bit low but it actaully depends on the headphones. I tried some smaller maxell ones and it was really loud, while two other ones only had a limited max volume. I liked the scan feature cause sometimes when i buy a cd I just wanna preview a bit of the songs and it lets u hear the first 10 seconds. It also came with an adapter, a thing that hooks on as a remote w/ volume, stop, pause, and next track buttons. What I liked was that the batteries last forever and it even comes with some rechargeable batteries."
2,Disappointing sound,"I tried this player because I've owned another Philips player (AZ7594 - discontinued) that is still unmatched as far as sound quality, controls, and accessories go. This player seemed comparable on paper, but I found the sound to be lacking -i.e. the bass was not that strong, the highs were too sharp and the mids were not full. Also the volume is definitely not loud enough and distorts the sound when turned up. I would not recommend this player for anyone serious about their music quality."
3,A good player but with its eccentricities,"I don't know if it's just the one I got, but to get stereo sound, you have to leave to the headphone jack about 1/3 of the way out. If you press it all the way in, you get sound only in one ear. So that is odd.Despite that, it is a good machine. Handles easily, not too heavy, good sound (when you get the headphone correct). A nice display too. Headphones that come with it are very big and not practical for on the go use. However, they are good on an airplane.Skip function is fantastic, has an easy to read face and the bass boost is nice. Batteries last a long time, even the rechargeables."
4,Nice latin band with a splendid opener,"I bought this CD because the label Kufala put the first song Sr. Judas on a Sampler, free with a CD from Lettuce. This song starts with digital samples of human voices talking about freedom, intimacy and other theme's in Spanish, English, Dutch (!), German e.o.. Then the song starts, rap with a punky groove. It's very original, a mixture of rap, rock, salsa and ska. Also the other songs on the 2 live-CD's are alright, groovy latin music, but not as surprising and beautiful as the first song. I mean, nothing wrong with it, but ""where did I hear this before?""So if money is not the problem, buy it at least for the first song. I mean, when you're from Mexico-city, and you use samples of German, Flemish and other rare languages in a rhytmic way to make an intro, and it's beautiful and thrilling, you are creative!"
5,More accessible Zevon,"Warren Zevon's first outing of the '90s was his most accessible song cycle in years. He had always delivered albums with scattered catchy songs, albeit with a typically cynical underbelly, dispersed among more musically challenging (i.e. difficult to the casual listener) and lyrically esoteric material. On Mr. Bad Example, the melodic and more straight forward word play are in majority. Even opener ""Finishing Touches,"" with all its sly cynicism and usual dry wit, if offset by an unusually straight forward song structure. This actually seems to work to Zevon's benefit here. Going for more basic songs does not detour from his sentiments, but often adds a seldom fore seen poigniancy like on heart-on-sleeve classics like ""Renegade"" and particularly on favorite ""Searching for a Heart."" Zevon covers all the bases, from being a ""Model Citizen"" to ""Mr. Bad Example"" so convincingly. He was a man of many masks, and wore them all well on Mr. Bad Example."
3,Not one of Zevon's stronger works,"I hate to be the naysayer here as I am a great fan of Zevon's works, butMR. BAD EXAMPLE has that feel of going to the same well once too often. Starting off with the forgettable ""Finishing Touches,"" most of the CD sounds like a retread of his earlier work and it comes off poorly in comparison. Not to say there aren't some solid numbers here like the melancholic ""Suzie Lightning,"" the amoral joy of ""Mr. Bad Example,"", and the strangely upbeat ""Things to do in Denver when You're Dead,"" but they almost seem out of place amidst the lesser works. There is overall lethargy that seems to cling to this CD. Along with MUTINEER, this has more unremarkable songs than any other of Zevon's recordings,but MR. BAD EXAMPLE is still worth having for the true fan. However, The casual listener will find all the best cuts onI'll Sleep When I'm Dead (An Anthology)"
4,Good stuff.,"""Mr. Bad Example"" Did not chart (1991).As his audience eroded to a certain few, Warren's wit was just as strong and the ballads were spot on. The hard rocker ""Finishing Touches"", one smart ballad in ""Suzie Lightning"", ""Angel Dressed In Black"", is a nice mid-tempo rocker. The rolling title track, this brings Warren's wit to the forefront. The country feel of ""Heartache Spoken Here"". ""Things We Do In Denver When You're Dead"", with the roller skating keyboard and also great lyrics. And the album closes with another fantastic ballad in ""Searching For A Heart"". His next album would come 4 years later in, ""Mutineer""."
4,"Strong album, definitely worth re-releasing","This is a much darker album from Zevon. Generally his subject matter is fairly dark anyway, but here he gets a little nasty. It's nice. The caustic 'Finishing Touches' and the placid anger in 'Model Citizen' set the tone, and the beautiful 'Searching for a Heart' ironically ends the album. Its subject is looking for love in all the wrong places, thinking of it in all the wrong ways - ""you can't start it like a car, you can't stop it with a gun."" This song encapsulates the whole theme and feel of the album: dysfunctional people, bad examples.For such a popular artist, it mystifies me why there's four Zevon CDs that are out of print. By a freak of nature my half-brother had this in his collection, and I couldn't believe my luck.Why can't there be a re-release of 'The Envoy', 'Stand in the Fire', 'Mr. Bad Example' and 'Hindu Love Gods'? There's definitely a market for them."
5,Lovely and passionate,"This book is sensual and passionate. I could feel the sun in Tuscany and the soul-deep feelings of Cassandra and Basilio. The characters seemed so real to me, with the kind of problems that good people find themselves facing, that I keep thinking about it. Very highly recommended!"
5,romance poetically done,I have been caught up in a romance that we are not suppose to know about.Personal moments that we got to share. Poetry that touches your spirit. Lovely and honorable. I did not want it to end. Will the author let us know about Julian and Gabriel. I want to know more about each sibling and the Black Angels and Rianna. More about Martinique. There is so many little mysteries she weaves in her books. I found this refreshing. I will read all her books.
1,"BORING,BORING,BORING",This author also writes as Ruth Wind and has written some very decent stories with plots and characters that are so honest and believable. But this monstrosity is nothing but a pathetic attempt to sell books and I fell for it. The dialogue is stilted and the characters have no character. The story just goes on and on and on......blah.
2,bad for industrial sites,this product works great in a quiet enviroment such as the house. when i tried to use it at work in tanks and around loud equipment it is useless.
1,Fine for distance to a barn,"Since this is a sonic measure it won't work unless your target is big and flat. Measuring the ~30' distance to a dumpster worked, most of the time. A fence was a no go because the gaps between slats confused it. Worthless."
2,Unreliable technology,"With inexpensive lasers available which are quite accurate, why would anyone rely on the unreliable ""sonic"" technology (it is not a laser) used by this unit. Sometimes the measurement is correct, sometimes it is widly incorrect. You never know. The problem occurs with measurements that are ""sort of"" correct but not really and are not caught. These innacuracies can cost time and money later on. Buy a real laser instead and get reliable measurements the first time around. This is generally not worth the trouble. However, the little red dot is fun if you have a pet."
2,Not a great measurement device,"I bought this at a chain home improvement store and plan on returning the device. The laser dot is nice for pointing, but since it measures using sound waves, you don't really know where the sonic measuring system is pointed at, or what might be obstructing it. When you get a good reading, its accurate. But its hard to get a good reading. And once you've taken one reading, it is often hard to get another reading (possibly I'm misusing the device). If there is anything within a radius of a few feet of the device as it goes to the target, you can get corrupted readings. It would only be consistently useful in an empty house with all light colored walls."
1,The Strait Story,Extremely disappointed with this thing.It does not measure accurately as verified by an old fashioned tape measure.It is very misleading since this does not use a laser to measure but uses sound.It may work for bats but this is for the birds.Every time I don't review a product on Amazon before I buy I get burned.When will I ever learn.
1,CRAP-O-LA CHEAPLY MADE POOR directions save your money,by the time it took me to open the plastic shell I was so mad I felt sending the gd thing back. then after I got it open then I found I bought crap
2,Dog toy or Measuring device?,"Well, we thought it wasn't accurate and it's not. Once batteries start to run low so do the measurements. The dog loves it though, we have fun running him ""dog-tire"" chasing the infra-red light."
1,Inaccurate,"If you buy this, check it carefully as soon as you get home.First time I used it, it showed a measurement of 20'5"". Actual measurement was 19'11"".Not much point in having such a cool toy if you have to double check every measurement the old fashioned way."
1,POS,"You get what you pay for...This thing is a useless piece of crap. Apparently, it is the same distance from the kitchen to the end of the living room, as it is from the sun room to the end of the living room....there is at least a 20 foot difference that this thing does not seem to see. We have a vaulted ceiling, but it ain't no 65 feet high...but wait, its 31 feet...no, 24 feet...hmm, this thing can't seem to make up its mind. Made in China, what do you expect? The same negative review goes for my Strait Line stud finder, as well. No stud for 39 inches? Our house is of poor construction, but its not that bad. Come up with the extra money, and buy a reputable brand name, such as Husky or Stanley."
1,laser loser,What a joke. My house is so much bigger then I ever imagined.A fool and his money were thusly parted.
3,Works OK for quick and dirty measurements,"I'm a general contractor and use this to make quick estimates of whole room square footage (Drywall, paint, etc.). It's cheap looking, but as long as nothing is protruding into the path of the ultrasonic beam it works ok (+-1/2"" is more than enough precision for simple estimating). For absolute precision and for shooting between objects go with the PLS1 Laser unit from Pacific. BTW...my cats love chasing the laser dot. It was worth the money for that alone."
4,Works but is limited,"The Strait-Line Sonic Laser Tape works great if you know and work within it's limitations. I got mine for $8 and that's about what it's worth. To be accurate it must be perpendicular to the wall being measured. Because it works with a sonic tapping sound (the laser just helps you get the device positioned properly), objects in the way like furniture that absorb sound can throw off the measurement as well. While I wouldn't trust it 100%, it is good for estimating paint, furniture layout etc. The ideal situation for the device would be an empty room with a flat ceiling and perpendicular straight walls. I wouldn't trust it for exact measurements like needed for construction etc."
3,Works like it should but has obvious limitations,"This does what it is advertised to do. Put the butt against the wall and find the distance to the wall on the other side. So what's the obvious limitation? You can't measure anything in between like conventional tape! So forget about measuring objects, distances between studs, etc. You get the idea."
1,Not a winner,I purchased this unit at the local lowes yesterday. It is not accurate or consistant at all. I would not recommend it.
1,Optimist at best,I am a structural enigneer in southern California who often rely on accuracy of dimensions for use in design. Please don't trust this device unless your tolerance is within the 2-3ft range.
1,Strait-line Sonic Laser Tape 50,"Besides being an amatuer woodworker, I also have been fixingup our 100 yr old house.I own several convential tape measures. Out of curiousity, I decided to buy the Strait-line Sonic Laser tape 50, wonderingif I could simplify my various measurement needs of my projects.My biggest complaint is that this device does not provideaccuracy of less than an inch. My second complaint is that theadvertising for it does not clearly disclose this fact.Due to this lack of accuracy, I can't find any real use ofthis device in anything I do. From my perspective, a waste of roughly $30.00on a piece of garbage.Hopefully there are other laser measure tapes on the marketthat are more accurate....for now I will stick to my old fashioned method."
3,Not a colouring book - however great for decorating,"If you are looking for a coloring book, this isn't it. The picutres are beautiful and will look fantastic on top of colored paper and then framed for original inexpensive oriental decorating.Not what I was looking for, however, I am greatly happy with this purchase."
3,Finished the book but did a lot of skimming,"I had high hopes for this book after reading what it was about. It was a turn of the century historical novel set in Scotland. There were times that I was really engrossed in the story line but most of the time I was skimming through trying to find something of interest. Unfortunately, there was so little content that was necessary to the telling of the story that skimming was easy to do."
5,A nice surprise!,Got this on a freebie day. Got pulled into the book and interested quite early on. Enjoyed the book very much!!
3,Well.... you could do better,"From looking at the track listing, I would recommend the ""Ultimate Hall & Oates"" album instead if I were in the market for a compilation disc. Otherwise, I would suggest you get all their albums to complete your collection. Daryl & John have made loads of great songs that were never released as singles. FPS, their demos are better than what's on the air now.Track Listings:1. Maneater2. Kerry3. I Ain't Gonna Take It This Time4. Rich Girl5. Family Man6. Italian Girls7. Private Eyes8. Crazy Eyes9. I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)10. Starting All Over Again11. Open All Night12. Your Imagination13. Back Together Again14. Room To Breathe"
2,"ready or not, here he comes! where?","there i am at the video store....lamenting the fact that they dont make good old slasher films anymore, i see this on the shelf. My heart skips a beat! I mean, look at the cover man. ""Ready or Not, Here he comes"" it says. The 'he' in question is right there with a hockey mask and a chainsaw. Yes! Well i figured i'd see what he could do.Not a whole hell of a lot! For heaven's sake, i've seen more slashings in my kitchen while i'm cutting vegetables! More blood too! This is almost worth a rental to teach a lesson..don't judge a slasher by its cover."
2,Lacks Originality!!,"In so many words, ""Bloody Murder"" is Friday the 13th with a Scream twist.Right from the beginning you can tell this movie is going to copy Friday the 13th, just look at the cover. Camp counselers are setting up camp while waiting for the children to arrive, however instead of Jason Voorhees doing the killing it's supposedly a man named Trevor Moorhouse. Bloody Murder pretty much steals everything from Friday the 13th, even the senile old man who warns the counselers that thy're all ""DOOMED""The only difference between this movie and Friday the 13th is the fact that we don't know who the killer really is and that is much like ""Scream""So, if you've seen a ton of horror movies like I have and you just need a fix maybe you'd consider renting it, however I wouldn't suggest buying this cheap carbon copy of other great horror movies."
4,Well crafted teen horror movie!,"Like the game whose name it borrows in the title, there is more to ""Bloody Murder"" than what meets the eye. The characters are three dimensional cut outs of clever, Kevin Williamsonesque two dimensional puppets. Are they saying the lines because they feel them or saying the lines because they want to hear themselves say the lines? From the self-referential characteristic of the killer's name (Trevor Moorehouse) to the juxtoposition of late 1990's icons with the slasher motifs of a generation back, the story challenges you to question the very reason we turn to the movies to experience fright. Are we using scary movies to satisfy a fear impulse or do we watch scary movies to subconsciously validate our inner aggression? That said, I didn't know who the killer was (which was a good thing) and there wasn't enough nudity in it (which was a bad thing). The lack of gore didn't bother me like these other guys."
3,Scream Bloody Murder review.,"A whole mixed bag of emotions watching this film. At times thinking these girls are just too ditzy and annoying; getting annoyed myself and mocking them, to laughing so much at the things they say, genuinely finding it funny. This is a comedy horror that doesn't take itself as seriously as some other horror movies do. It is controversial at times, overt sexuality, it has blood and gore; I felt one scene was a bit too dark to see what had really happened to one of the girls. And unfortunately the dvd I bought was a $2 one from a junk shop which kept freezing and pausing most of the time which made it hard to watch.Although, overall I was pleased enough with this movie, it was stupid and funny and had some creative murder methods, it was not see-through enough to not puzzle you at times."
3,The Legend Of Trevor Moorehouse......,"I really liked this movie along with Bloody Murder 2. I'm always one for a masked killer lose in the woods! especially yielding a chainsaw! I bought this movie without renting it first and I was not sorry I did for I have seen much worse movies. The movie tries to be a Friday The 13th type film. Although not as good as the Friday the 13th films, it was still a good movie. Taking place in the woods with campers and counselors, the ""legend"" becomes real as bodies soon turn up missing or dead. The legend of Trevor Moorehouse is now a reality and now the remaining survivors must fight for their life or be the next victim. A must see for slasher horror fans. I definetly recommend anyone seeing this movie. It might be a ripoff of other movies but it still delivers enough to keep you interested."
3,I am mixed.,"Well, if you are looking for a serious horror film... DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE. The acting is bad, the gore is horrible, the blood looks fake and the movie basically has a story line that has been used... about 10 times (Friday The 13th 1-10).But, if you want a laugh.. this is worth checking out. You may get a little aggravated with the bad acting and the ""it's Trevor Moorhouse"" refernces. A tad bit overdone. The plot fails to tell you who he is, where he comes from, why he is killing, et etc. Trevor also turns out to be some little 5' 10"" 180lb masked squirt with a chainsaw instead of a left hand (UM, EVIL DEAD 2?!?).Anyways, watch part 2 instead. Almsot the same storyline.. better gore, blood, acting,story, etc."
3,Bloodless Murder,"""Bloody Murder"" is an average slasher movie with nothing to offer to it's audience. There is almost no violence. The death scenes are done all off screen and we barely see the after effects of them. The plot is a mess, and becomes confusing and rather uninteresting as the film goes on. There is also no sexual content or nudity and no eye candy either. ""Bloody Murder"" is just another slasher movie with no plot. Would have been better if it had more violence, more sex, and more plot. This film, although rather entertaining, should really be called ""bloodless murder.""~SCORE~OVERALL: 72/100 CCAST: 14/20 C-PLOT: 13/20 D+DIRECTION: 15/20 CFUN: 16/20 B-SPECIAL FX: 15/20 C~CONTENT~Language: 4Violence/Gore: 5Sexuality/Nudity: 4"
1,And The Award For Worst Acting And Script Goes To...,"You people giving this 2 or more stars must be on something, and whatever it is, I don't want any. This movie was atrocious. The only reason I watched it was because there was nothing else on TV, and I just wanted to see how bad it really was. EVERYTHING about this movie was dismal. Oh, and there's a sequel? That tells me that enough people supported this movie. Ugh. That's all I have to say about this piece of garbage. Waste... Of... Time..."
2,"no blood, bad movie","I have no idea why they titled this movie ""Bloody Murder""! I didn't see ANY blood during the whole movie. When I watched it, I thought it was dull at first and then when it ended, I thought it was very stupid. If you are someone who likes blood and violence then DON'T rent this. It actually isn't very scary either."
1,"ALMOST as bad as ""Shakespere In Love""","And believe me, it is tough competition. Basically, this movie rips off every Friday the 13th movie, and as well every horror cliche, not to mention scum-of-the-universe-acting that isnt even funny it is so bad, much like the movie itself. SELF PARODY? More like SELF DESTRUCTION!!!"
1,Cheapo rip-off of Friday the 13th!!!!!,"What a horrible movie! A group of counselars go up to camp to prep it for the summer season. When they get there, there's a killer in a hockey mask ready to kill them all. Hmmm...this sounds farmiliar...very farmiliar...can you spell LAWSUIT?! To take their Friday the 13th fun even further, they named one of the kids Jason. I can't count how many times a character says: ""Where's Jason"" each time someone dies. Geeze...whatever you do, don't buy or rent this [junk]!"
5,Bloody Murder movie review,"The movie Bloody is a excellent flim in the movie Bloody Murder you don't find out who the killer is until the end. The movie has excellent actors and actresses in it, also its not glory but still scary but its still a very good flim."
3,FRIDAY THE 13TH RIP OFF,"A guy in a hockey mask kills kids at Camp Placid Pines. I was so upset by the rip off aspect of the film, it was difficult for me to enjoy it. This story includes the creepy old guy who warns the kids about the killer as well as the kid who wears a hockey mask just to scare the other campers. It is better than most low budget slasher films, but not where we want it to be.No F-bombs or nudity."
3,Stylish,Bloody Murder does rip-off movies like Friday The 13th but it was good. It wasn't scary but fun! The Acting was ok. There were some funny parts like the joke (well not really a joke) where one counsler said We Were watching Summer Camp Massacre 14. Bloody Murder tells the story of masked chainsawing killer Trevor Moorhouse. A must see for slasher fans!
2,It was okay,This was okay. The killer isn't who you think that's the only good thing. The deaths aren't that good and there's no nudity. That's odd for a summer camp slasher movie. All in all don't see it.
2,VERY BORING,I first got turned onto Ann via her Easy Living CD WOW what arrangements nad her interrpetaions were amazing but this one is just plain dull nothing new or inspired here...just plain laid back to the point of SLEEPY.I have to agree with the other review posted by JOan its just plain syrup...such a shame because she is an awsome talent....
1,Everyone seems to be advertising original but sending out reprints!,Everyone seems to be advertising original but sending out reprints!I am like 0 for 6 in trying to purchase an as-advertised original start war comic book!
1,read the textbook instead,"I bought this set with my upcoming chemistry exam in mind. I am so glad I didn't pay full price for it. What a dissapointment. It cheaply uses an internet browser interface as its own (Netscape), and barely brushes the surface of topics that are in desperate need of in -depth explanations. The ""glossary"" takes a long time to load, if it ever does at all. Topics which most beginning/general chemistry students find daunting, such as nomenclature and chemical formulas, are barely addressed in a simple half page of text.I was so excited that this product existed for college level classes, but it's really a big bore. College Pro Math is a much better product, with animations and voice instruction. This Science package is practically useless.After trying my hardest to study with this horrible, slow and boring software, I am going to sit on the sofa with my chemistry textbook and my chemistry flash cards, and study the old-fashioned way. Don't buy this software."
5,coleman solar extension cable,"American made, good quality cable. The color makes it stand out outdoors so it is easy to spot, the clear connecting end is lit when power is present, so you know if it is plugged in."
4,dick tricks,When I saw this existed I ordered it immediately just to see how they played out the hilarious title. It turns out to be a collection of dick trick photos. Inventive and entertaining if you like that sort of thing. If they'd also shown us how to fold paper into those shapes it would be worth the full five stars.
5,Women and Men,Everyone will love this. Not at all a nasty thing in any way. This is just plain fun and creative. May want to be adults only however.
3,Puppetry of the Penis: The Ancient Australian Art of Genital Origami,Off the wall subject matter. Looks painful. I'm an artist and draw the nude figure and find these bodily distortions somewhat outlandish. I found the subject matter more artistically interesting than humorous.
4,Take me Back,I had this album on cassette and was praying I could find it on a CD because I wanted to Bless some other folks with this worship experience
5,Who Wouldn't Want This?,"This is Count Basie at his finest hour!! Great Songs, great tunes, great arrangements and they are having fun doing it. You can just feel it. This was when bands were truely great. Pick this up for a blast from the past and one of the greatest bandmasters!!The Time Keeper"
4,GREAT SOUNDTRACK!.....MISSING ONE TRACK......,"I've been a fan of Tales From The Crypt for years, Have all the DVDS, and had to have the soundtrack-of course.. But the score from 'And All Through the House' is missing. That was my favorite-all time score from Tales from the Crypt. I wish they had put it on the soundtrack too:("
4,Good beginner's resource,"This video is well presented, and is a good resource for very beginners to Access. Even adds a few beginner's tips to navigating in Windows environment. However, if you've already used Access and know the basics, and are looking for direction on fine-tuning databases, this is not for you."
5,I use these suckers at work all the time,"Im a nurse in an ICU and I cant even tell you how useful these bad boys are. I use these to mark EVERYTHING. Foley bags, check, IVs and IV tubing, check and check, sleeping nurses on night shift, super check. The multipack makes me the ICU that much more colorful."
5,great little markers,These little Sharpies are great. I can put them on my ID badge at work and always have one available. I like the variety of colors the markers come in. Great product!
4,Nice and Decent Value,"These are a little bit less then the big box stores and no shipping and handling. They are small so you don't have to carry a bulky sharpie to meetings, in backpacks or in a EDC bag. They are great space savers and work just as good as the larger models. I like the clip in top easy to attach to a backpack or other hook.I recommend them they are a good price for a quality, albeit small product."
5,I love these,"What can I say...I love these mini sharpies! I use them for everything, from labeling CD's to labeling file folders. They are easy to use, small enough to store in tight places and I can even carry one on a chain or keyring if I had a reason to (I don't). I will never get another large sharpie again because they are a lot more fun and cute! ;-)"
4,E-Z Up Instant Shelters Deluxe Weight Bags,The bags are well designed and built.I just which the Velcro strap was a bit longer (2 inches) because they barely fit around the posts that I am using these bags for...
1,Broke first time,"The carrying handle on one of the bags ripped right off the first time I picked it up. Called EZ-Up and got an ""off-hours"" message even though it is clearly within their stated business hours. Left a voicemail; will wait to see how they respond and will update this review."
4,Held tent in place during 40 mph gusts,"In the outer winds of what was still Tropical Storm Isaac, my tent stayed in place when we had a sudden series of gusts that measured 40 mph. I was amazed as other tents began flying. This is my second year using these weights. I suggest filling the bags with sand and leave a little bit at the end to top it off with pea gravel. The velcro seal at the top tends to loose some of the sand over time but the pea gravel remains in the bag and holds the sand in place.The tent legs may need the holes at the bottom bore out with a drill bit to allow the pins to be inserted through the legs. That is the only negative to the design of the product. The pins are too large for most tent legs."
4,HEAVY-duty!,"We work at farmers markets on the weekends and need weights to hold down our 10x10 canopies. These weights are great. They are easy to fill, easy to close (they use velcro instead of a stupid zipper), easy to attach to the canopy, and even come with metal clips that secure the bottom of the weight to the canopy pole. However, beware, when filled with pea gravel, these weights are very heavy. I can carry only one at a time, and need both hands. But you'll never have to worry about your canopy or tent blowing away!"
5,Did the job,"This was the first time i've used any type of weights on a canopy. I was going to try making them out of pvc pipe and concrete, but I was in a rush for time. I bought them and I was pleased with them. The only thing I would suggest is they should make a plastic liner or water proof them. I had one that they set an ice chest close by and the water ran onto the bag and turned it into mud.The delivery from Amazon was excellent!!! like always."
2,Lousy Product,"Anchor loops at top of bag(s) won't hold up. Ours ripped after 5 uses. This is a great concept, but simply a poorly made product. If you have space to carry these bags, you have space for cinder blocks."
4,My New EZ Up Weight Bags,"These are so much better than the square, flat type I used to use. They are easier to carry and the sand inside the bags doesn't seem to get wet even after being caught in a rain storm. They are relatively easy to attach to the base of my EZ Up Tent. The surface under the tent really determines how easy or difficult it is to slide the metal hook through the hole at the bottom of each leg of the tent. Most of my shows are on grass and soil. Sometime the soil is bumpy or even has a tree root under the booth site. The new sand bags are great!"
5,EZ Up Tent Weights,My friend and I started a jewelry business and decided to start entering outdoor Art Fairs. We choose the EZ UP Tent and needed to weight it down. I was so impressed with the EZ UP tent weights!! They are easy to work with and do a great job. We just did a show and of coarse with our luck there started to be high winds that came along with tornado warnings! These weights held the tent down with no problem which made me even happier with my purchase! I highly recommend them.
1,MP3?,I was informed in the Technical Information that This Product could so read MP3's. I have so far burned and ruined alot of cd's because of this. I kept trying to change things to get the player to read them. The PHILLIP's cd player is not MP3 compatible. I was told by Amazon.com that It was indeed MP3 compatible. Therefor I do not recommend this cd player if you think it plays MP3's. Otherwise the cd player is great but the volume is not so great.
1,MP3 Compatable?,"The manual does not mention anything about requirements for burning MP3 CDs so the player can read them. Perhaps the technical specifications for directory structure and file naming conventions are assumed to be common knowledge or self intuitive. I doubt anyone could guess which bitrates are supported. No indication of media requirements either. Will a ""data"" CD with music burned to it in audio format work? (It does) My research led me to Philips' customer care line (1.800.531.0039), where I was politely informed (in Ebonics) that MP3 compatibility is not listed as an included feature on this or any AZ model. It says MP3 compatible right on the package. Is this a case of false advertisement?"
1,wow waste of time and money. I liked PJ until I read this trash...,Poorly written and lacking of any real insight. The jokes are of a grammer school level and the stories drome on forever. Way too self serving for my taste. Overall the book reads like a geek trying to prove he is one of the cool kids. Save you money on this baby.
3,ENJOYED READING-NOT WHAT I BOUGHT IT FOR.,I ENJOYED READING EMBEDDED BALLS BUT IT WAS MORE LIKE A PETER JACOBSEN AUTO BIOGRAPHY. THATS WHY IT GOT 3 STARS. I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE MORE GOLF HUMOR INVOLVING A LOT MORE TOUR PLAYERS. I REALLY LIKED HIS FAMILY AND THEIR VALUES AND IF THIS BOOK WAS MARKETED AS THE PERSONAL LIFE OF PETER AND FAMILY IT WOULD BE 5 STARS.
2,Full of typos,"I am a college-level literature and writing instructor who has used this text twice when teaching an Ethnic Literature course that my department offers. The text has many interesting selections for multicultural study; I especially like that students get introduced to writers ""off the beaten path"". Unfortunately, this text is so full of typos and other writing errors that I refuse to use it again. I am on the hunt for a more professionally written text in this field of study. This one simply does not reflect college-level writing standards for my students and I feel it is irresponsible for me to teach with it."
5,exit stage left,"This book has the whole gang in it. LD, Stephanie Kaye, Lucy Fernandez, Wheels, Joey Jeremiah, Snake,.. ok you get my drift. The story is about The Degrassi Kids pulling together to make a play a sucess. Rivalries began. Egos explodes. Friends become enemies and love triangles are all around. Will Joey get with Stephanie? Will Stephanie even acknowledge Joey since she wants Wheels? Will Wheels be brave enough to admit he wants Lucy? You'll see it all unravel in the end. Enjoy!"
3,"Decent quality, not sure about the 10mm padding","The bag seems to be well made, no bad stitching in mine as mentioned by another review.There are two lightly padded backpack straps, better than no padding.Inside, there is another strap to secure the headstock, which is great.One big pouch in the front and another smaller one at the back.It arrived folded in half in a plastic bag and seemed somewhat squashed.The main issue with it is the padding. The specifications say 10mm but it seems more like 8mm or less at the moment.Either way, the padding seems which light and easily compressed, probably not going to absorb much of a impact.Well, it is a basic case @ $23.If you intend to carry the guitar around often, I recommend you get a better bag (with better padding) for a bit more money.If you intend to use it to store the guitar at home, it is adequate."
4,lol dude,"so the bag i got looks NOTHING like the one in the picture, but hey, my guitar fits in it and its still a stagg. right on man."
2,Needs improvement,"Model number: STB-10UE. Check it out on staggs website.Misc feature: Inner strap to hold neck of guitar.Cons:1- Quality of stitching is bad at some places. The threads are either open or loose.2- Pockets - NOT AS ADVERTISED ! There is only 1 pocket and not 2. Besides, this pocket has barely enough space and cannot expand. The max I could fit with ease was a box with 1.6"" depth x 8"" width x 10"" length.Pros:If you want basic protection at low cost ($20) and you handle your guitar like a baby, then this bag is ok for you. Otherwise, get a hard case.Alternative for about $25:Guardian Cases CG-090-EM Electric Guitar Bag. See their website for meaning of codes and sizes of guitar that fit.[...]"
4,NIce and cheap guitar case,"Well made, padded and with backpack straps. It fits most guitars though somewhat lose for the small Martin guitar that I have. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and the case it's great to carry the guitar around town."
5,"Lager-drenched, bittersweet pop","I love spreading the word about great records nobody knows about. Singer/songwriter Denzil's one and only album, Pub, is filled with completely engaging, lager-drenched ruminations on stale romances, fatherhood, aging and DRINKING -- all imbued with a decidedly wry, English sensibility. The sad/funny tales are packed with poignant honesty, squalid working-class details, and a darkly self-effacing sense of humor. Yet another excellent album and artist that were nearly completely overlooked."
4,Better luck next time.,"If only for the song ""Running This Family,"" this is a small triumph of English realism, in the manner of the Kinks. Melodic, pithy, melancholic, and poignant all out, a damp sitting-room of a tune that sinks in to reprobates of all stripes, so long as they can hum a tragedy under their fetid, hoary breath."
5,Great Guitar-Driven Pop!,"If Ray Davies and Nick Lowe had a child in 1968, that child would have released Pub in 1994. Pub features hooky, guitar-driven melodies and clever, thought-provoking lyrics. Any fan of British pop should definitely give Pub a listen. And if you're not a fan of British pop, Denzil may just make you one!"
5,On an indie label--this would be a collector's item by now,"The wit and self-deprecating style of costello, matthew sweet meets a Brit version of Tom Petty. Hooks abound on this CD. Clearly talented and a writer's skill with melody and lyrics, it's embarrassing that this has never seen a larger audience--much less a follow-up from him.For my money, the track ""Useless"" is one of the best unheard 90s anthems EVER."
3,Feels Cheap....,"This product just feels cheaply made - it really is not what I expected and I am disappointed. I expected a solid & well built scoop that would last me a long time....I am lucky if this lasts me a year. It does not feel like stainless steel - it feels almost like a lighter plastic product with a light metal coating. I plan to only hand wash & only to use for scooping cupcake batter - hopefully that will allow for a longer use time. I was going to get the other size scoops from Norpro for fruit salads, sundaes & scooping meatballs...but, after feeling how cheaply made this is I will definitely pass on purchasing any of the their other scoop sizes."
4,just right for measuring cupcakes / muffins,"Just fine! Exactly right size! Sturdy! Easy to ""crunch"" handles together! Only had it a week, so can't speak to oxidation issues, but I'm happy with it."
1,Disgusted and deceived!,"I ordered this item believing it to be, as advertised, a Norpro scoop from Amazon. Instead, what I received was a no-name brand scoop that looked like it came from a dusty dollar store rack. I had ordered 3 different sizes of scoops. All three were advertised as being Norpro and sold by Amazon. Only one actually was. I was able to compare it to this one and both the packaging and the quality of the items were vastly different. In addition, instead of being sold by Amazon, the packing slip states that it, and the other no-name scoop, were sold by ""Jayson Trading Company"". The return paperwork has been processed & back it goes!"
5,Very durable,I bought this for my daughter who loves to make cupcakes. I thought it would be easier to scoop up the batter and it works great! She loves it!
5,PERFECT SIZE FOR CUPCAKES!!!,"I've used this scoop over the holidays soooo many times to scoop out dozens of cupcakes! Order this one for the perfect size. If you bake cupcakes alot, this is for you. Great quality."
2,Didn't receive the Norpro item,"As usual, I should have listened to other reviews. I also did not receive a norpro item. Whatever I did receive looked as if the packaging came from the dollar store - very weird. I was really surprised, I haven't had this happen with items purchased directly from Amazon before.That said, the item itself is a medium weight. The large size is perfect for muffins and cupcakes, which is what I wanted it for. However, it had an extremely sharp edge when I received it that had to be sanded down. Next time, I will go back to my OXO scoops that I have had for years and love."
1,Sent cheap ice cream scoop instead,"Instead of a nice Norpro scoop, I was sent a cheap ice cream scoop much bigger than the scoop I ordered. It doesn't have a brand name on it or anything."
3,Should come with Kraige,"I have used this book and the accompanying statics book all within the last year. The author is my Dynamics professor. These books are not as thick as other Statics/Dynamics books I have seen, and the reason is that they are more problem-set oriented than lecture. You really need a good teacher to help you understand the problems and material. This is where having the author as the teacher helps. The instructional sections of the book are minimal, and I have found the problem sets better for the learning process.If I were to change this book I would add numerical solutions to every problem, not just the odd ones. And for whatever reason, the publishing oversight is uber critical of posting solutions anywhere other than the classroom, and this can be a nuisance sometime.Fun fact...a self-proclaimed car guy, Kraige loves problems with cars in them, so there are quite a few of those in there."
2,"Terrible Explanation, Good Problems","This book is terrible at teaching. Each section provides the concept for the following questions, but does not explain things in detail. You won't be able to learn dynamics with this book alone. You will need the solutions manual."
1,Do not get this book!,"I am currently a student and am using this book to try and learn something about dynamics. The sample problems are great and easy to follow, BUT the rest of the questions i have found to be nothing like the sample problems, and are solved in a different manner. Many of my other fellow students agree, and as our lecturer is not very good i have to now RESORT TO BYING ANOTHER BOOK, very dissapointed and [$] out of pocket. Thanks alot Meriam"
1,"Same quality as the Statics text (that is, low quality)","The authors treat this topic with the same dense, obtuse, poorly worded approach they used to write the Statics text. If you ever want to use your textbook except to do assigned problems out of it (that is, you want to learn from it by reading it) don't expect it to help you much, if at all."
3,Lacking examples,"I feel that the book is a bit vague and lacks the number of examples needed to fully explain how to work the problems. I can't really blame them though, I enjoy short and concise chapters and it did give 3-4 examples per section. If you manage to find the solutions manual then this book is a great learning resource. I can't emphasize this enough though, the chapters teach you very little, all the learning is done through the examples."
1,Absolutely Aweful,"This book is aweful, by far the worst book I have ever cracked the pages of. The only way a student could learn dynamics in a class that uses this book is to get a great professor and throw the book in the garbage. If you are considering buying it- DONT. Instead spend your $100 on a dog, you will learn just as much about Dynamics from that. Good luck"
1,Horrible,"If you want to learn dynamics, this book is not for you. Too hard to comprehend, and the examples are of no help. Usually I can blame the teacher for a tough class, but this book is impossible!!!"
1,Not Helpful,"The text doesn't help at all. Half the time, proofs are done in the teacher's manual, but not in the text. The problems are not well correlated to the sections, buy another book if you're assigned this one, its horrible."
1,Worst Book Ever,"There is nothing more frustrating than understanding the chapter, being able to follow the sample problems, and then not knowing where to begin on the actual problems. If you love nausea and headaches, then I recommend buying this book. If you have a soul (or a life) DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! If you're thinking ""Oh, I loved Physics in high school, let's give Engineering a try,"" then I dare you to open this book. Don't blame me when you seek relief by filling your stomach with pain-killers and your mouth with bullets. This book has single-handedly turned me off to the prospect of becoming an Engineer. I implore you, hire a tutor, switch to Political Science, whatever, just don't buy this book. You WILL be disappointed!"
1,Book is unclear,"You better hope you have a good professor, because this book is completely useless at explaining concepts. Unfortunately, I don't. The problems are probably good, except that I can't figure out how to do any of them, since the book doesn't explain anything well enough, and my professor doesn't do any better."
3,Good Resource,"This a great resource for new theatre producers. I really enjoyed it and it gave me some great tips on the bare bones tips. Another great resouce that I've found is actually a blog from off-broadway producer, Ken Davenport. Check it out if you get a chance: [...]"
5,An Absolute Favorite of My Two Sons,"This story weaves together several Russian fairytales to create an exciting adventure from start to finish. My seven-year-old enjoys any well-written story of mythical beasts and young heroes performing impossible tasks, but the gorgeous illustrations made this book captivating to even my three-year-old. The pictures are beautiful, detailed, and large; there is a high art-to-text ratio that makes this book perfect for young children. Both of my boys ask for this book again and again, and it is one of my favorites to read to them. I highly recommend it."
4,Norpro 5 1/2-Inch Stainless Steel Funnel with Detachable Strainer,"Norpro 5 1/2-Inch Stainless Steel Funnel with Detachable Strainer.It is a very good Funnel, I wish the strainer was a little better made."
3,There should be no surprises with the operation of a funnel.,"You cant be surprised with a funnel....it's a funnel. No moving parts. It does what a funnel does...It funnels lol. Well it's very well constructed. It's made solidly. The strainer is designed to filter out larger particles. What I'm working on is setting up a rig that will have 2 funnels. This 1 will catch the big particles, and the second 1 will be lined with a coffee filter. Cutting the top off of a soda bottle will work fine, and the spout even fits in most standard cooking oil containers. You can just use a coffee filter on a single funnel if you like, but it will take longer if your oil is dirty. Enjoy."
5,good add-on for the new fryer,"solid device. well made. although highly recommended on the web site, it was a limited selection of similar items so there may, just may, be one that is a little better, but certainly not worth pursuing in our opinion."
4,Love it!,Just the ticket for straining hot oil. I like the removable strainer. Like the stainless construction. Overall a good product.
2,Need better picture,Well this funnel comes with what looks like a smashed stem. This is by design and they list it as a heart shaped stem. If they had posted a better picture I would hav eknown this is not what I wanted. It isnt polished internally and the stem looks like someone creased it with a pair of vice grips. Not happy with the misleading pictures and description.
2,Performed well but...,"When it arrived I thought to myself that the filter holes look a bit larger than expected. Upon first use the filter is only good for large particles. Grit and bits of things like floured coatings slipped through. I ended up using a couple layers of cheese cloth instead.One other ""nit"" to pick. Because of the design, when inserted into a largish container openning, there is little to no room for air to escape so I had to lift the funnela little to let the air out. Laddling 4-5 liters of oil one handed was messy at best.All in all my $2 large plastic funnel and cheese cloth performed better for my needs."
3,I agree with the others here...,"What can you say about a funnel? It works, even if it is a bit expensive for what it is. As others have said, the strainer is a bit on the course side, but a coffee filter wrapped around it seems to take care of the filtration issues. Had this been $5-6 I would have given it 4 stars instead of 3."
4,strainer,works as advertised. nice wide opening to give you plenty of pouring room and not spill/slop liquids all over the counter.
4,down the drain,Well made. I wish the thing was a little wider at the spout. Crummy delivery. Was supposed to take 2 days but took 2 weeks.
4,A lot faster than a funnel with coffee filters,I tried that the first time I used my deep fat fryer. This doesn't filter as much but only takes minutes rather than days. Price was good as well.
5,Creased Funnel Spout?,"Maybe you all can help? I've now received my 2nd funnel in the mail and both display the same crease in the funnel spout. I know it's not the same funnel that I sent back, as they were cross-shipped. Is this a manufacturing defect or is it actually by design? Did everyone else funnel have this same trait? Thanks for your help!"
4,A Good Funnel,"My only compalaint is that I wanted a funnel bigger and deeper, but that complaint's a small one. I don't regret buying it."
2,Sieve not fine enough for oil,"I bought this funnel set specifically to save deep fry oil for reuse. While the body of the funnel seems fine, the wire mesh insert has holes that are large enough for floating particles in the oil to pass through. While it does get the bigger stuff out, the smaller stuff remains in the oil, which renders it useless to me. Perhaps I'll do as another reviewer did an use cheesecloth in conjunction with the body of the funnel instead of the sieve, and see if that works. Feels like a bad buy..."
2,Doesn't do the job.,"The strainer is almost impossible to get seated so the oil bypasses, as well as material that needs to be filtered out. The strainer clogs readily and it takes quite a while to even attempt to filter the cooking oil. Very frustrating to use."
4,Solid Funnel,I got this funnel for homebrewing small batches of wine/ beer. The strainer is more or less useless for my purposes but it is finer than I thought and catches medium to coarse debris so I can actually use it instead of cheesecloth for some ingredients. My girlfriend uses this for tinctures and infusions as well; but the spout is too big for dropper bottles.Why 4 stars not 5?The outside finish is highly polished; the inside of the funnel is a brushed finish and it appears that after a couple months of use a very faint surface rust develops on the inside but cleans off.Also the edges of the handle are rather sharp and can become uncomfortable depending on how you hold it.
2,"It's OK, I guess.","I mulled over buying this funnel/strainer for several days before I bought it. Another customer review saying that a #2 coffee filter works well to increase the filtering of oil, but it does not. Since the #2 filter is of an entirely different size, it is impossible to keep it in place while the oil is being poured into the funnel. I tried this with both the strainer in place and removed. The small expense isn't worth the trouble to return it, so, like another reviewer here, I'll just chalk it up to experience."
4,works good,I got this to strain oil from my deep fryer and it works pretty good. Put a double layer of cheese cloth and it's perfect
5,Does the trick,"use this to as an initial filter for beer when transferring it over from the brew pot to the primary... works well - large, and easy to clean"
2,Not tough enough...,"I have been able to keep it functional for over a year, but only by jury rigging it. The handle broke the first week I had it, and I had to JB Weld it back together. Expect the long arms to bend the first time you don't seat a can correctly. You will constantly have to make minor adjustments to the arms to keep it working. After a year or so, the drywall anchors are starting to separate from the wall. This is a fine product if you only are going to crush a few cans a week, but if you are planning on crushing 100s of cans, look elsewhere."
1,not what i had been looking for,this is not bad product for soda cans but i was looking for something that could handle pet food cans. this won't
2,not sturdy,When used in a soda can you must come down fast and the side arms will bend if not perfectly aligned. It needs to be more sturdy and not bend.
1,dreadfully fake computer music,"do not waste your money on this album, it is well intentioned, but dreadful, in that it is all performed by one guy on his synthesizer.yes he travels you to various arab lands, but only to hear elevatorized versions of the original.wanna start listen to arab music? read about it first, listen on line, and choose from oum koultum, farid al atrache, al ghazali,andalousian orchestras on blue silver label, the master musicians of jajouka, etc etc etc."
5,Unexpected benefits of this book!!!,"I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend. He thought it would improve my guitar playing. What I noticed almost immediately, within the excercizes is actually a methodolgy for dealing with attention deficit disorder! I have had ADD since before there was a diagnosis for it and the methods in this book are not only helping me with music but are also having a profound affect on other areas of my life. I don't think it was the author's intent to help in this regard, but this ""inner game"" method has far reaching implications....Thank you!!!..."
5,Well developed techniques for musicians,"Using Timothy Gallwey's ""Inner Game"" techniques, Barry Green has provided here an excellent resource for musicians who feel that they practice adequately, but still lack a ""certain something"" in their music. Mr. Green leads the reader through a series of examples and techniques that combat nervousness, a lack of emotion, and many other problems that most musicians face. Although I am a rather well versed saxophonist, I tended to get nervous before many of my performances and auditions, and the techniques of the ""Inner Game"" have helped me to combat that. My practice time is now more effective, and my performances are better because of this book. Some may feel that the only shorcoming in this book is that Green discusses too many varying techniques, but in actuality they are all similar in philosophy and practice, and they all lead the performer to greater chances of success."
4,Inner Game review,Similar concepts of Gallaways other books ( I have read them all) with a good musical propective. I recommend it to musicians especially if they perform.
5,One of those books that everyone should read.,"This book helps to quiet that voice in your head which makes it hard to focus and concentrate. If you want to be a pro at anything, read this book; then read it again a year later after experiencing some of these techniques in action."
3,Cute....,"I bought this for my 6 year old to use in times where he has to sit still. It works well, but there are too many magnets and not no place to put them, I wish there had been a place to store the extra magnets, but overall, I was happy with it."
1,"More Like ""American Crapelmy.""","I met this so-called Professor Brian Roberts in college once, and let me tell you, HE'S A TOTAL CRACKPOT!!! He tried assigning sections of his award winning book to me in a pop culture class and I barely read it, because I know a thing or two about ""sticking it to the man.""'Cause that's all that history classes and professors teach you - The rich guys were all right and the poor guys were all wrong, or the women were all right and the men were all wrong and the men still got away with it and do today!We all know that 49ers are just a football team in a town full of gays. They even passed up Matt Leinart! So in conclusion, poor, nomadic speculators with nothing to lose were the real ones to do the gold rush. They truly are tales of ""rags to riches"" and the pioneering capitialist spirit in the 19th century. c'mon."
5,A must-have!,"I totally agree with the previous reviewer; this is a fun book to read with your kids and do the activies together. It's also perfect for those awkward moments when they ask you a question like, ""how does a road work?"" and you don't exactly know the answer. It spells out everything in an easy-to-understand way."
5,Great for beginning engineers to get an introduction.,This book was ideal for my daughter to get an introduction to Engineering. The reading level was just right for her.
5,Forever Young,"Very happy with product, plan to give it as a gift to a family member and know this will be the perfect gift, great selection of oldies song,"
1,Samsonite Folding Luggage Cart,"Product would not function as received. Was about to return, when I found another cust review that described the problem that I was having - folding up the cart. After a very very strong rap , I did get it to fold up - I then filed out the holes to allow it to function adequately.Design is ok, manufacturing quality is poor - Samsonite should review this item - it is NOT up their standards."
1,A poor choice,"I was shown this luggage cart and thought it would be perfect for my needs. However, neither the sales person nor I could get the cart to fold up. After five or six frustrating minutes, the sales person left me to wait on another customer.We never got the cart to close and I did not buy it."
1,Flimsey,"That carrier can't stand any weight more than 25 Ibs. I placed a bag that weighed 40 Ibs ,the whole thing came apart . I would like to retun it, but I couldn't because the wheels have marks on them and I had already thrown away the box. TOTALLY USELESS.M"
2,Handle too short.,"The handle is about 2-3 inches too short when extended. I am 6 feet tall with, I believe, proportional arms and this cart handle is just a tad too short which causes me to walk with a slight lean and kick the cart when I step. The wheels are also canted a little bit which seems to cause the cart to wander back and forth. The elastic straps also seem to have stretched out so that I have to get creative when I strap things to the cart so that there is enough force applied that the items don't fall of. I've owned the item for about 3 1/2 years and use the item once a month for treks through airport terminals when I don't need an overnight bag. It barely fills the need. I would not recommend this item to someone."
1,Junk - Do not buy this cart,"Do not buy this cart. This cart broke the first time I used it.Samsonite Micro Mover Fold Away Luggage CartI loaded this cart with 2 carry-on items weighing approximately 15-20 pounds apiece - legal carry-on items, a soft small duffel bag and a backpack. The fitting that attached the leg on the cart broke as I turned away from the check-in counter at the airport. The leg was attached to the cart with a plastic fitting - the weak point on the cart. When the fitting snapped the cart was useless because the wheel was attached to the leg.I thought that this would be a good lightweight cart but the construction was too flimsy. If I were to consider a lightweight fold-up cart I would pay more for substantial metal fittings.I subsequently had to purchase a small metal cart for more money. However, it lasted the rest of the trip - several countries and many airports."
5,Light weight Luggage Cart,"Having read the helpful hints on folding the cart in the reviews here, I had no problems folding the cart. The diagrams on the products information card are helpful if you pay attention to details. The cart works well and wheels smoothly. At first I thought elastic cords would have been easier than the strings on the cart to secure luggage. But after I figured how to make it work, I realize the strings are more secure because they won't expand under force and give the luggage a chance to fall out."
4,Helpful hint.,"I followed the directions left by another reviewer, and can add one more helpful hint. In step 2, I find it works much better if you do push the handle all the way down so the button pops up. Then, push the button, release the handle slightly. I then found it to fold up quite easily (step 3).I hope that helps someone - other than the tricky operation, this little cart appears to be perfect for my needs."
4,handy & useful,"A little difficult to fold but really manageable once you already know & get used to it. Very slim & handy, easy to store in your car or at home."
3,Just Okay,"I used the luggage cart on a recent trip to England. It was easy to assemble, but a little more difficult to fold up. There are a couple of problems with it. It carry's the bag very low to the ground and the handle extension is quite short. I am only 5"" 1"" so it was not too bad for me, but it may not work for taller people. It also seems heavy -at least more than 2lbs, which my not seem much, but can feel quite heavy when you have to put it in your carry-on luggage."
1,A shameful disaster,"Can't believe anybody would ever invest money and effort in designing and selling a so useless product like this one. Extremely difficult to open and close, so frail and flimsy as bending with a small bag. And only comfortable for using my midgets or little kids. A complete shame. Don't buy it"
1,Light but soft!,"The design is clever, smart! But it really can't hold much things on it. No way to carry over 50Lbs! Soft!"
3,"light weight, in more sense than one","I bought this to use with a porter bag that does not have wheels. It fit the bill on weight, but because its so light, it is not nearly as strong as the more hefty versions. For what you are getting though, I think its a good buy. I recommend practicing opening and closing the unit several times prior to your travels so you are accustomed to using it."
4,Samsonite Micro Mover,"This luggage cart was just what we needed to carry a PA Speaker to our car. After putting speaker in car it folds up, taking very little room. Returning to our apartment, it is stored, setup & ready to repeat on another day."
4,Almost gave up,"I read all the reviews on how to fold this up, and was about to give up and ship mine back unfolded. Somehow we figured out that if you squeeze the legs together, the handle will fold down with ease. Wish I knew that before I bruised my fist trying to force the handle down.I haven't tried it with my luggage yet, but I'm glad I am able to open and shut it now."
1,Flimsy Piece of Junk!,"I weighed the items I put on this, 45lbs. One duffel and two medium camera bags, all were within carry-on size restrictions. The included cord wouldn't hold the items, I had to add two of the Masterlock cords shown on the product page. I had to bend over, the handle is to short for me. Don't even think about going up a curb let alone stairs, the whole thing tips over on its side. The wheels kept getting caught somehow on moving sidewalks, I had to stand still. The handle started bending and became loose. I almost threw it out before I got home, but I waited."
1,Samsonite Fols Away Luggage Cart,"This product is very poorly designed - one of the poorest designs I have ever seen coming out of a reputable company like Samsonite. I am simply amazed by the type of ""quality Control"" procedures Samsonite uses! This product should NOT have been marketed in the first place. I have learned my leasson and I am NOT going to attempt to buy anything made by Samsonite any more. Here is why:I purchased the product and it broke in its first use! The ""Plastic"" piece/assembly that holds the two metal pieces cracked and broke spontaneously! The The flexible stoppers that is supposed to hold the metal rod in the middle in its place broke off too! The whole thing became nothing but a piece of ""junk"" when I arrived in Europe during my trip. Also, I was only carrying a laptop bag weighinhg less than 10 lbs on it (including a laptop in it)! It is interesting to note that Samsonite claims that this piece of ""trash"" is supposed to handle upto 50 lbs of luggage on it!!!"
4,Samsonite Luggage Cart,Overall a good product. If only I could figure out how to tighten up the cord when the cart is folded up!
4,Easy to operate,I purchased the folding cart for my computer lap top bag and I love the ease with which I can open and close the cart and its portability. It serves me well and makes my travel through airports and business trips much easier with the ability to accommodate my lap top brief case and my overnight travel bag. I feel I recieved a very good value for my money.
1,Discharge Hose,Unfortunately they don't bother to sell this in long lengths so its of little use. Of course you can buy several and link them but your paying for extra fittings. Find a place that sells the hose with out fittings and buy one set of fittings and save a lot of money if you are running 200 feet of hose or more.
2,Just ok.,"If you are looking for a reference book to keep in your department, look further. This book is limited in information. Although the information that is presented is done so very well. I have returned this book and purchased others for my department with much more clinical information in them."
4,Interesting read from people who were there,"I have been intrigued for some time by the story of the Glomar Explorer and the effort to recover K129. The sheer magnitude of the task and the application of cutting edge engineering (for the time) still amazes me - and it all worked!!. Though more information is now out in the public domain (see Michael White's documentary ""Azorian"" for more details and some actual film footage), there are still many unanswered questions which may never be fully known. For an engineer, this was an entertaining story, well-told."
3,wow,"did not know this was gospel, i know my mistake, i do love the wow dvd's but looking for younger type music, this is for my sunday school class. too mature for this age"
3,My first Irish cd,"I have an interest in Irish music, being that it is in part of my heritage, however I was never exposed to it growing up. So when I seen this cd and the price I decided to try it. It took a while for me to get the feel for it. I think it is more like poetry put to music on some of the songs. It is surely irish and has a range from slow long love songs, to a couple up beat and fun. I'm sure there are better Irish cd's out there and I will continue to look for them."
3,Too long!,"I liked Michelle West's previous two books in the series, but the third one is a little slow. Her prose is lovely, but occasionally convoluted. At 688 pages, this was somewhat of a chore to read through. This book could have used some serious editing, but if you have patience, sit down and enjoy."
4,Somewhat disappointing -- after waiting all this time,"Tthe third episode of the series does has its moments, but I am disappointed to say the least that Kiriel didn't put in any appearances. Instead there are more additions to the cast of characters, and the plot gets more convoluted.Ms. West, I hope that you give Kiriel a starring role in the next episode. I think you have a great character in her and she's my favorite character in this series. Please do give her a leading part in the next book. Thanks."
5,this series rocks!,"All I can say is that this entire series is totally awesome!! I love all three of the books so far, and I am really looking forward to the fourth. I haven't read Hunters Oath or Hunters Death as of yet, but I'm working on it. I was a little disappointed that Kiriel was absent thru most of the book, but I really liked that Jay was talked about so much (those two are my fav. characters!) Anyway, I would definitely recommend this book, all the books in fact...you can't read just one! They pull you in, they're so great!!"
3,Does not move the story along,"I really enjoyed the first books, especially the Uncrowned King, but was very disappointed in this latest offering. Not only does it introduce a whole host of new characters, it ignores some of those that were so painstakingly created in the last two books. With the series already at 5 books (counting Hunters Oath and Hunters Death), I would like to see this series move toward some type of conclusion, rather than see it turn into the perpetual ring that some recent, well acclaimed series have become. It is a very well written book for the most part, and very enjoyable, but it seems like we are on the road to 10 or more books! Can we finish this in one or two more, PLEASE?"
2,"Plodding, boring","I loved the first book. The second book was okay. I figured there would be resolution in this, the third book, of the lives of Diora and Valedan. I supposed I thought the two of them would join forces.The Shining Court invalidates the wonderful first book and uses a couple of characters from the second to come up with an unsatisfying tale.I won't bother reading anything else she wrote."
5,very helpful book,this book was very helpful with lots of information that was clearly explained. Dr. Hamilton is a very good and kind vet.
5,Best description of illness in the body that I have seen,The first 70 pages of this book are an exquisite description (one of the best I have seen) of how disease starts and progresses in the body. Dr. Hamilton provides fascinating perspectives that many of the illnesses of our cats and dogs today are simply the result of over vaccination and commercial pet food. I highly recommend this book to all my clients.
5,MY SEARCH ENDS HERE,"AFTER REVIEWING OTHER BOOKS & BUYING ANOTHER BOOK (that was poorly written) I WAS RELIEVED TO READ THIS. HOMEOPATHIC CARE FOR CATS & DOGS GETS RIGHT TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER. INDEX IS GREAT, NICE LISTING OF HOMEOPATHIC SUPPLIERS THERE PHONE, FAX & WEB SITES ( I had wondered where to get supplies but that answered it for me.) YOU ONLY RECEIVE NEEDED INFORMATION. NICE GUIDE FOLLOWS WITH EASY TO FIND REMEDIES. INCLUDES INFO ON HOW TO DECIDE YOUR ANIMAL NEEDS HOMEOPATHY OR IS IT TIME TO SEE THE VETERINARIAN. IT'S NICE TO KNOW YOUR LIMITS. I PROMISE YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK."
1,Way too difficult for anyone not deep into homeopathy,"I was sadly misled by all these glowing reviews. You'd have to be a herbologist or a wizard from Hogwarts to make these remedies. It's annoying how they keep calling the dog or cat ""your companion."" And there was nothing in the index about spraying or behaviorial problems.A shopping mistake for me."
5,Perfect,"I was looking for a materia medica on animal homeopathy similar to ""Homeopathic Medicine at Home"" by Maesimund B. Panos which is the ultimate guide to diagnosing and treating symptoms that I've been using for over 20 years. I ordered a number of books including this one and ended up returning the others. This offers a quick reference to symptoms and remedies along with dosage guidelines and also includes an in-depth reading on using homeopathy with animals opposed to the typical veterinary care/ western approach which is centered around targeting specific bacteria with antibiotics, which I have found tends to clog the liver over time and weaken the overall immune system. However, you can skip the reading and go right to the symptom/ remedy section if you prefer."
5,Thought provoking,"Dr. Hamilton is preaching to the converted with this reader, as I long ago joined the ever-growing mass of people who are seeking elsewhere than our modern American health providers for the medical needs of ourselves as well as our pets. His theories of how illness occurs and how we can approach curing dis-ease are quite thought provoking. In an age where most doctors are specialists who only provide medications that kill off a symptom and call it a ""cure"" , Dr. Hamilton provides information on a much needed alternative way of achieving health. I learned the hard way, almost killing my beloved dog with Prednisone, which stopped her alarming symptoms but caused much damage elsewhere in her body.His theories of illness and wellness are relevant to both our pets and ourselves. Open your head to it. It will start you asking questions of your medical support system, and that at least is a place to start."
3,Pleasant Romp Thru A Foodies Life,"Molly O'Neill has a very engaging writing style that pulls you into her world. It's a world peopled with the wildly obsessed, but go along as the ride is enjoyable. Molly O'Neill writes about a life that straddled midwest big city longings with utopian politics and food plays a big role at all stops. My only quibble is that the book has less to do about being Paul O'Neill's sister than the book jacket may lead you to believe."
5,funny and real story of growing up in a big family,"A great read, with some hilarious images of the way growing up was and poignant memories of the way life flows."
4,Toasty!,"Keeps me warm even in negative temperatures. The stuffing does come out a little bit and the sizing runs small. I am normally a XS, but I ordered a S and it fits well."
1,Thanks Disappointed and Disgusted from Northern California,"The author spends way too much time explaining basic economic indicators that should be basic knowledge for any investor. After I read another review that outlined the blundering editorial mistakes, I had to see for myself. All true! I cannot continue reading this text... How can anyone who makes this many conspicuous mistakes get a book deal much less be right about anything? Not worth the $70 price tag!"
1,This book must be a prank,"How else to explain that banks are brought down not by ""rogue"" traders but rather by ""rouge"" traders - is there a secret market for cosmetics derivatives? - that Switzerland has adopted the Euro, that a chart is described as listing a gain from 93 to 97 but only shows a gain of 93 to 95 etc., etc., etc ad nauseam.In my eyes, this book is so pathetic that it is only a slight exaggeration to suggest that all those involved in the creation of this book should never be allowed to touch paper and pencil again."
4,Great book to start with!,"As the author of the book ""Futures For Small Speculators"" I tend to be very critical of books that discuss my industry. Although this book had a few editorial mistakes, Mr.Gotthelf still did a solid job of getting his point across. For a beginner this is a great start. For more indepth analysis I would go to Mr. Cornelius Luca's books."
2,How to implement and back test this concept ?,"In theory the concept of parity is belieivable.But to implement it I guess one would need some really sophisticated tool and the book is not a practical guide to implement his concept. Even though book needs serious editing, someone academically inclined may find this book interesting."
2,One long bitch session,"This is just a long collection to the standard, victim hood whining. It is entertaining to read because it is so pathetic. People like this need to be a victim in order to have identity. Don't expect to find anything new or original. You might as well read S.C.U.M. At least it is funnier."
3,"Cable fits, Needs better software","Using the cable/s from PC to phones, fits perfectly. I just wish a better program is available to fully access the phone's images and ringtones. While the cable is universal, software is not. Many features that the product offers are not useable due to software support inavailability. The only feature that for sure works is the phone book access, handy if you have a big address book..."
5,This book is wonderful. Easy to read and follow,"If you need a guideline to explore your dreams, discover what you want and how to do it than this is the book! Its laid out in a readable easy to follow fashion and great for anyone who could use a little help making your desires possible."
1,The title describes this cd - bad bad one,"It's bad and I don't mean bad in a good way. There is nothing good to say about this cd. Don't waste your money. Some of the songs are embarrassing to listen to ""Crazy"" for one. I think she should drop the pop, hip/hop, gotta get a hit mentality, go back and listen to Blurring the edges and maybe she might get back on track on the next record."
5,Celtic Panpipes Moods,Nice relaxing mood music for those that enjoy panpipes. I have this CD in my iPod for when I wand the pleasure of relaxing mood music.
5,New York Dolls - 'Live In Concert - Paris 1974' (Skydog),"Rather you're a new fan of the New York Dolls or an old fan, this live archive release is IT. Can never express just how much that I, personally love archive CD releases as such. Sort of lets us know that SOMEONE out there in the music industry is thinking of us TRUE rock&roll fans. 'Live In...' was originally a radio broadcast that came from Luxembourg. Eleven power house cuts of pure full-hearted sweat-in-your-face glam punk is what the purchaser gets when he/she puts this disc in the player. Every tune is a winner, specially ""Bad Girl"", ""Pills"", ""Vietnamese Baby"", ""Chatterbox"" and ""Jet Boy"". Recommended."
1,Terrible,I like the New York Dolls but this cd sucks! Sounds like it was recorded with a tiny tape player. Get their studio cds!
1,Author Gives Prejudicial Opinions,"The publishing house putting together this series of books made a poor choice in the author for this volume. She loses all credibility when she makes the outrageous statement that white boxers aren't as smart as fawns or brindles. No scientific data supports this view and anyone who has shared his home with white boxers, as well as the others, knows it is untrue. The opinion of the author would be laughable if it didn't prejudice prospective owners and keep so many bright, sweet white boxers from finding the loving homes they deserve."
1,Bad deal,Should have come with a DVD and it did not. Then I sent the book back with areturn slip from Amazon and still waiting for my $$. PS This is one of my sons favoroite books from the school library and was a surprise Christmas gift. Guess I got the suurprise!!
5,Ok/good.,"I read this in hopes to understand the Imperial Japanese Army of ww2. Why they did what they & why they fought & died the way they did. For granting some understanding I give it 5 stars. But I must admitt at times it's a rather boring read. At other times it's not. I have other reviews about another book, so I'm now trying to track that one down."
4,Interesting and detailed account of the Japanese Army,"This is a fine one volume account of the Imperial Japanese Army. The book covers its creation in 1868 until its final defeat in 1945. If you want to know why the Japanese Army could accomplish the things it did and why the Japanese soldier could do the brutal things that he did this book goes a long way to help you understand. At the same time it provides a insight into the dealings between the Army and the Navy, the Army and the Politicians and the Army and the people. A well researched and very interesting book."
3,Too many undeveloped ideas,"The book suffers from its over-reliance on secondary sources and leaves many incipient ideas undeveloped. This is partly a consequence of biting off too much: a history not just of the Imperial Japanese Army but a century of world history. But there is no excuse for the meagre and unreliable citations supporting the text: too many references are left unattributed. Some worthwhile elements in the narrative include the analysis of Japan's transition from ""nation-at-arms"" to ""nation-at-war""; Japan's backwardness in army strategy and armaments after WW1 (having missed the lessons of the Western Front); and the persistent power divisions and delays to action within ""totalitarian"" Japan after 1937. A lot of ground is covered in this book but on each major theme other writers have done better."
3,Not High on my List of Recommended Books,"Would not be high on my list of recommended books about World War II. Although starts at much earlier date, its relevance to World War II is why I bought it. Fairly dull, especially the early history. Rated three stars; would have rated it four stars, except I cannot go along with characterization of it being ""lively"" by those who rated it higher."
4,A Must Read,"This is a stimulating read for anyone with more than a casual interest of WWII in the Pacific.A rich amount of well researched information is provided as the authors attempt to provide the reader with a clearer understanding of how and why the military was so entrenched into Japanese culture leading up to and throughout WWII.In fact, stimulating bits of information are so plentiful this one book could be easily expanded to 4 or 5 volumes. However, it is this abundance of information 'bits' that frequently left me frustrated and questioning why the authors would so casually drop in an incredible detail and then quickly move on with no further explanation.Nevertheless, the reader who has not studied this side of Japanese history will find new roads of thought in this wonderful book."
2,Not my cup of tea,"As soon as I put this cd in the car, I didn't like it to much, but thought i would give it a chance, after 15 min. my head hurt. Trance and house purests, do not be fooled by the title, If you want good trance or house, check out Armin Van Buuren, Dj Tiesto, Deepsky, Kimball Collins or Euphoria 1 and 2, to name just a few."
4,ENJOYED,"Like this category of movies; it was interesting, held my attention, was a descent production and of course it was free."
1,Not worth the time spent watching,"The script is a bit incoherent, but worse yet is Charlie Sheen, who is still learning his craft 17 years after this movie, yet is no closer to mastering it. He was worse then than he is now. Just awful, not worth your time. I regret watching it."
3,3.5 star movie with annoying political message,"Charlie Sheen does a good job as he always does. It's fairly exciting, the special effects are ok for the time period. It's somewhat interesting. There really aren't any unexpected twists though, probably a 3.5 star movie if not for the global warming message and the anti gun message (brief anti-gun message). Typical hollywood propaganda thrown in with the story, what else is new but it's distracting and annoying. 2.5 stars rounded up to 3 stars."
2,stupid,I just don't know what to say about this besides it's less than mediocre and the aliens are boring. At least Charlie Sheen looks sane and sober in this flick.
4,Powerful,"Sal Rainone's voice conveys great beauty of feeling in these operatic and popular Italian songs. On the last one ""The Crucifixion"" the sacred sensitivity of the message would better be served with original background music. With this exception, the CD is a powerful and enjoyable musical experience to this reviewer."
1,Allsop Redmond Monitor Stand - Black,"This is crap. Looks nice and professional but it is crap. The SPECs says it holds up to 40lbs. My monitor doesn't weigh more than 25lbs and it is making the stand sag. If it holds up to 40lbs you are getting on the floor to see the monitor display. SPEC dimensions are rounded up. To me SPECs should be exact. It is not 15"" wide. Major Over Priced. Inaccurate description. I hardly ever post a review. This is just wrong."
2,Not sturdy and steady enough,"This stand is beautiful, but wobbles like crazy. The top bows down under the weight of the monitor and wobbles left and right with my typing. Too bad. Will return."
2,Seasick -- take some Dramamine if you buy this monitor stand,"This is a nice looking stand, however, the metal used for the legs is far too springy. This results in your monitor doing a gentle up-and-down dance if you bump your desk, or walk past your desk, or glance sideways at your desk. It's a shame since it seems like this would be an excellent stand if only the metal was more rigid. Allsop is saving money by using less metal than they should, and therefore I can only recommend this monitor stand to people who have concrete desks sitting on concrete floors."
1,Collapses under the weight of a monitor,With no support braces at the front of this stand it collapses under the weight of a monitor. Probably ok for a laptop.
4,Perfect for what I needed,"I purchased this item based on someone else's review - that it would be a good dresser-top space saver for a 19"" HDTV and Cable box. It's perfect for that. THe wobble people describe is very brief and my TV does not move on the stand, so I'm not concerned. My only complaint is that the width dimension is for the top of the stand - my cable box has to rest on the legs of the stand. I though the cable box would be able to sit on my dresser, but it doesn't. Not a big issue, though."
4,Sturdy and easy to assemble,"We got new laptops with docking stations and monitors at work. I need a regular size keyboard and mouse and the desk was getting a little crowded. I chose this one because of the simple design and the ability to access all sides of the laptop - even when it was parked under the stand. My laptop fits snugly but I can access the DVD and USB ports. We have 22"" flat screen monitors and it holds it nicely while keeping my desk organized. My co-worker bought another - larger model of this stand which is also nice. She can put her speakers and other small items around the monitor. If I had more room - I would consider the larger size."
1,Item not as pictured,"This doesn't look anything like the picture shown.It is actually closer to this http://www.amazon.com/Allsop-Metal-Art-monitor-stand/dp/B0036RA5EA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1349465438&sr;=8-2&keywords;=allsop+monitor+standI am not going to return it because I don't want the hassle, I sort of expected this since Amazon seems to be going down in quality lately."
4,Sturdy for my monitor or laptop,I'm quite happy with my purchase. Nice product. Sometimes I use it for my monitor and sometimes for my laptop to keep it cool while I work.
1,Don't expect to use this with a CRT its not strong enough,Don't expect to use this with a CRT its not strong enough. The monitor bounces back and forth. One large monitor I had here brought the one part down to the desk. Lighter CRTs are OK but not very stable.
3,Wobbly but strong,"I got this for my 22"" flat panel. The shape of the legs gives you some nice storage space under, but also make this thing pretty bouncy. Any time you touch it, it takes about 30 seconds to stop bouncing. I pushed on it pretty hard and it does seem plenty strong, but it sure does bounce a lot. Even with me pushing on it pretty hard, it never seemed like it would bounce my monitor off though. Also, it does tend to lean toward the front slightly when you put weight on it, so this one is not for you if your monitor does not have a tilt adjustment."
5,Stack 2 Laptops on top of each other,"I bought this so that I could put one laptop on the bottom and one on the top and use one monitor/keyboard/mouse between them. the size is PERFECT. Both laptops fit perfectly under and above and my desk is very much uncluttered now with the computers all on one spot instead of in two spots on my desk. I know that this is not what the product was intended for, but for this use it is very sturdy, the size and the price are great."
4,Good stand,"Its a good stand, by Xbox360 fits nicely underneath it with my 22inch LCD on top. the only downside is that it doesn't have legs on the front so it has sort of a spring to it. i just used the 2 Styrofoam blocks that came in the packaging to make it stiff."
3,"Not bad, but bounces a lot","Turns out my wife didn't want to use it for a monitor stand because it's too high, and not adjustable. We still used it to clear up some desk space by putting a printer on it. I don't think I'd like it as a monitor stand much. If you bump the desk a little, it will bounce and shake for a minute which would make me sick."
2,I feel like I'm on the high seas,"I ordered this monitor stand to hold my dell 21"" computer monitor... so that it would be at eye level and save my neck. Once I set it up, I immediately noticed that the weight of the monitor (it's just a standard flatscreen computer monitor) causes the whole stand to wobble at the slightest touch or vibration. When I'm typing and my desk shakes, or even from the vibration of music... the stand will wobble so that the computer monitor sways forward and back. I find this to be quite a nauseating experience. I feel like I'm getting seasick on a boat. I think I'll return this in favor of something more solid... or a couple of phone books. I would note that this may be a good solution for a laptop computer stand, but it's not working for me as a monitor stand."
1,Not a good product,The stand is not very sturdy. The slightest bump will cause the entire stand (and the monitor on top of it) to bounce. Very annoying and nausea-inducing if your desk is in a high traffic area.
3,wobbles,Don't attempt to use this for anything other than a light weight monitor. It really does wobble up and down when any significant amount of weight is placed on top of it.
3,Bouncy,"Got these because they looked cool, but they were very bouncy with a standard 24"" monitor on top of them. Monitor jiggles for some of our employees when they type."
2,Poor Construction,"Since the monitor stand bounces up and down, I had to place a can on one side to stop the bouncing. And after having this product for three years, the black rubber cover became very sticky. I've replaced it with a monitor stand from 3M."
1,Unstable Piece of Junk,"When I placed my 24"" flat panel monitor (which is not particularly heavy) on this stand the front tilted down more than 1/2 an inch and it bounces every time i touch my desk. Don't trust your expensive monitor to this completely unstable platform."
3,wii cords,These look sturdy and kidproof. Looks like my extremely long cable cord may not fit .But they should work good on gaming station cords which are shorter and more plyable.
5,they changed their sound! but for the better...,"This band sounded almost too pop-punkish with their S/T CD, which, at the time, I thought was amazing... but it started to wear out,.. I then picked this up for 6.99 and thought it was cool, then I was caught off guard by some songs (in a positive way), and this quickly became a constant fixture in my CD player... this is much rougher, faster, emotional, aggressive than its predecessor, and it's a really musically tight album... Damon moving to drums was a very smart move by the band, as he did a perfect job filling in for Travis from Blink on last year's tour... and his style fits Fenix TX perfectly. The new guitarist, James Love doesn't appear to be much of a punk band by the comments about him in the liner notes, but he definitely influences this band to go much harder, and they do it really well. This is a very strong offering by the Fenix TX boys, who have finally let go of their xerox-of-Blink-182 label."
2,"Guys, What Happened???","Fenix TX had one of the best albums of the year with their last effort, now they drop this album of semi-angry, non listenable radio rock on us? What happened to the catchy, humor-filled punk? If you liked them last time, or as River Fenix, stay away from this one and hope they come to their senses. If you are angry and non-melodic, pick this up and rock on."
5,Fenix TX does it again.,"I am a big fan of Fenix TX, based solely on this sophomore effort. I have the first album, and I love it to this very day.If you look at the credits on the first album, it says all songsrecorded in 1997. That was almost [time] years ago, and to me thats a pretty long time. And time is evident on ""LECHUZA"",these guys have definetly matured. Most of thier songs start off with a kicking intro to catch your attention, songs like ""abba zabba"", ""pasture of muppets"", and ""something bad is gonna happen"".Thier songs are bringing different cards to the pop/punk table.William Salazar's love for the deftones are falling into place perfectly, as his lyrics are somewhat like Chino's but unique in its own way. This album is one if not the best that I have purchased this year, simply because they took a chance and did not stick to the same three chords to amuse simple fans. Keep rockin cali Fenix."
3,A bit Disapointing,"I first have to say that i had great expectations for this cd, after the great debut, but alas it is not so. What im really missing is songs like ""minimum wage"" and ""surf song.""Probably the only 2 songs that are good are ""threesome"" and ""abba zabba."" since they had the new guitarist, im not liking the new ""heavier sound.overall this album has a lot of a more ""dark"" feel. if you were a fan of the first, borrow it from a frind and decide for yourself, otherwise i wouldn't check this out."
2,"FenixTx took the ""Punk"" out of ""Punk Rock""","After their self-titled album, I thought that Lechuza would be awesome. Compared to their previous disc, this fell on it's face. There is almost no distinct punk sound, most of the songs are basically metal with some cheesy arena rock in there. You know, the kind that a studio band would make up for a pretend band on a tv show or movie. If you liked their self titled disc (which I loved and still listen to religiously) or you like bands like Blink, New Found Glory, or Allister - DO NOT GET THIS ALBUM - it sounds nothing like punk or pop/punk. Regardless of what some reviewers said, this is NOT punk, I mean, listen to the samples. Hopefully, they got this out of their system and can go back to making great music. (PS - if you don't already own their other disc, buy it. Every song is great.)"
2,"Man-oh-man, why did spend [dollar amount] on this?","I really dig punk and emo music. Ive heard about these guys for awhile and have even heard their infamous song, Phoebe Cates many times. So I figured what the heck it only has to get better. Boy, was I wrong. Several of the songs seem to be right out of the pop metal era. Play song #8 with your eyes closed and you'll swear you're listening to Tesla.I gave the album a shot. 2 of the songs are fantastic ( 1 and 7) so I fugured the rest would be the same calibur. I was very wrong. The rest of the cd seem to be Bsides of pop metal. The guys voice is great and its obvious they're very good musicians, just not at all what I expected. Don't confuse these guys with the Ataris or New Found Glory- they're much better.Here's some advice for future buyers: If you scoff and make fun of hair band music, DO NOT play this with your windows down. Unless you like wind blowing through your mullet."
2,Where did it all go wrong?,"Their last cd was great and when they were riverfenix they were a lot more catchier and funnier. This cd sounds like they all have no emotion and it's disappointing. The punk is gone and in return are some cheesy hard rock riffs almost like on something bad is gonna happen. Phoebe is an excellent song, but overall I was disappointed with the cd. Even the hidden track is hard rockish after you get through the annoying minute and a half beep."
3,"Alright, but not Fenix TX","I was a bit dissapointed upon listening to this the first couple of times, but even though it has somewhat grown on me, I still find that they have changed a bit too much, since their last and only album. I'm not sure if it is due to the huge emergence of emo or they are just changing as a band, but there was very little humor, and a number of the songs sounded exactly the same. I have been out of the punk scene for a while, but I remember seeing these guys before all the hoopla and blink 182, when they were River Fenix, and they were very entertaining and VERY catchy. Now they are just semi-catchy, and a bit corny at times. I guess this is only for the diehard fan of these guys, I guess I am not."
5,EXCELLENT CD BUY IT TODAY,"The first time I listened to this CD, I thought wow it's so different than their first cd (Self-titled), but I still liked it. Now, 9 days later I find myself listening to it almost all the time. It IS a lot different that their first CD, but it's in a good way. It's not as punk but they go for all different kinds of music which is something they haven't tried before. There is emo, punk, rock/alternative, and metal. But even though there are different genres, there is not a bad track on the CD. I tend to listen to ""Katie W."" and ""El Borracho"" a lot, those are my two favorite songs (at the moment, they change all the time!). But they are all good! I definitly recommend this album for anyone."
5,A Great Sophomore Album,"This album far surpassed my expectations of these so-cal punk rockers. After listening to the Self-Titled for months and months and memorizing every lyric and every bass line, I was beginning to become bored. I also started worrying that this album might be a sell out, much like Blink's followup to their great Dude Ranch. And then this comes out and I am in awe. What was once a simple surfer/skater punk band has now become a full blown band of musicians. No more catchy riffs and easy licks, now its into three part harmony throughout and a variation of keys throughout the songs. This is much better than I had expected, and I wish Fenix TX luck with their musical careers. They've gotten two great albums behind their back, lets see some more."
2,erm...,the last cd was better. much better. lechuza could easily confuse with the offspring. some songs are good on it but half of them i really think sound like the offspring...but thats just me so...
2,very different,"i used to be obsessed with blink and all that stuff. i've moved away from them now and am into harder stuff. but i wanted to hear what fenix tx's latest cd sounds like, so i recently went out and bought it. i listened to lechuza. then i listened to their self-titled. huge differences. they have a few similar songs but everything else is mostly rock. no punk. plain old rock. kind of like everclear. they have an emo song in tearjerker and a couple are sort of punk but you're really getting, as another reviewer said before, american hi-fi. if you like pop-punk, dont buy it. well it is sort of listenable but you have to have an open mind."
4,A Different Direction for Fenix TX,"This CD seems more like a departure from the first album. It seems less punk and more like, say, The Nixons. Still a good album, though."
2,Got worse...,"I thought the Fenix TX debut release was ok... slightly above average (maybe 3 1/2 stars out of 5). Lechuza is less pop punk, more plain rock. As soon as I put Lechuza in my CD player, I noticed a big change from the self titled. I browsed the booklet and realized they had traded in their old guitar player for a new one. They lost the pop punk sound and thats what I liked about the self titled. I can't listen to more than the first 5 or 6 songs on this CD before I get sick of it and put something else in my CD player. I recommend downloading songs from this album before you buy it. I have to give them props for the song Something Bad Is Gonna Happen cuz its a good hard rock song and I also admit to liking Abba Zabba. Its not horrible but I think you could do much better. I wish I hadn't spent hard earned cash on it... save money for something better.NOTE: Threesome is the easiest song to find to download but don't be fooled, its one of the better songs on the album."
1,"If you liked their first CD, you'll hate this one!","Fenix TX's first album was great; it had a new, original punk sound that was energetic and powerful. Their new CD is the complete opposite! Fenix TX has changed a lot since they replaced their drummer with their guitarist and got a new lead. Their music now sounds like everyday alternative music made for the radio. The first five seconds of each song are interesting and then it switches to the same old alternative lyric style. Their music has become boring and uninteresting. If you loved their first CD, I recommend you buy New Found Glory or Less Then Jake, and NOT this CD."
4,Lechoooooozaaa!,"I like the title. OK, Fenix TX is a great punk-rock band. They've got a killer 11 song album here that nobody is buying, why else is it $9 at Tower Records? Well, it's a great CD, definitely one that you'll want to pick up. The first four songs are great, all are a bit different from the next, and change is great (sometimes). Great CD!"
4,Almost As Good As the First,"If you like slightly less hardcore punk and are familiar with Fenix Tx, then I highly reccomend you pick up this CD. Their first album is a bit better, but that's not to say that this album is no good. ""Lechuza"" succeeds where ""Fenix Tx"" failed and vice-versa. Basically, both CD's are essential to completely appreciate this great band. Pick up ""Lechuza"" today. You won't be dissappointed."
3,NOT HALF AS GOOD AS SELF TITLED,"This cd is wierd. They have some hard rock and metal songs on here that are pitiful. Its probably cause they changed one of their guitar players. The reason it got 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the 5 good songs, 3 are fantastic.1. Phoebe Cates-8/102. Katie W.-7/103. Threesome-9/107. A Song for Everyone ( my favorite Fenix TX song) 10/1010. Abba Zabba-7/10You are MUCH better off getting the self titled. Its awesome."
4,Showdown at area 51,"This wasn't a high budget, quality film, but being able to see Lee Horsley,again working, was great !!! The quality of the dvd was first rate and a great deal for what I paid !!!"
2,"Ok movie, some good acting","The beautiful Gigi Edgery is in this film, you know her from the Farscape TV Show. I think I also saw this flick on the Scify channel before, though I did not recognize the title when I rented it. It's not to bad, middle of the road. No fancy special effects here, it's pretty low budget in that respect. Gigi, Jason London, and Cody Bell save this movie, since they are the best actors, and their scenes carry the movie along. Most of the other actors are just there, or over-acting. Nothing really new here as far as scifi goes."
5,Does exactly what I needed,"My exercise bike had a hard seat for some members of my family. This fixed the problem perfectly. We were concerned about the seat fitting properly, as the seat of our bike was a large size. This fits on very well, does not slide, and is comfortable."
5,Perfect for my Gold's Gym Exercise Bike!,I bought this for my Gold's Gym 290 Exercise Bike. The seat on the bike was so hard it was rough to do the 30 minute ride I bought the bike for....enter this AMAZING seat -- what a difference! It fits perfectly on the extremely large seat.The padding is fantastic. It's thick and cushy and after a month of daily use it's not giving up anytime soon!I highly recommend this for anyone looking for an exercise bike seat!
3,Serfas Exerciser Pad,"Works OK, but a little bit more padding would be nice. Fits over exerciser bike seat real good. Far better using this Serfas pad over the bike seat than just the bike original seat alone."
3,"Comfy, but I slide","This seat is an add-on to my exercise bike, and is wonderfully comfortable. However, since adding it on, I find myself sliding/ being pushed forward as pedal along.Still gets three stars for providing excellent relief to my behind and back as I pedal along."
3,Could be more gel-ish,"I bought this more expensive seat because I knew it would fit my bike from reading another customer review. I have a Gold's Gym 290 upright bike that has an unbearably hard seat. Using this gel cover is an improvement, but it is still painful to exercise on this bike after about 20 minutes. I'm hoping my rear will adjust to the pressure over time. The cover does seem to stay on the seat quite well."
4,Better than before,"Nice cover, seat I had was very hard to sit on. bought this for my exercise bike.Works very well. Fast shipping also."
4,Good for a indoor cycling bike.,I bought this for my Sunny Health & Fitness Indoor Cycling Bike and it makes a huge difference. The seat that came with the bike was so uncomfortable I couldn't use it. This seat makes a huge difference. The only problem I've had is it shifts some while you're sitting on it. But other than that it's worth the money spent.
5,Ahhhh!,I can ride my stationary bike without pain or numbness. I didn't believe that this would work when I bought it but after one 30 minute ride it paid for itself! Love it!
1,More uncomfortable than my exercise bike seat,"I purchased this cover for my Proform 280 CSX upright exercise bike which has a very uncomfortable seat. I was hoping that the ""extra gel"" on this seat cover would relieve the pain in my tailbone; however, this cover makes the pain worse. The anatomic dip creates a rise on either side of the dip relative to the edges of the seat, increasing the pressure on my bum. This is the second seat cover I've tried for my bike; looks like my quest continues."
3,"Comfortable, but too big.","Had to send it back- it was comfortable but too big and wouldn't stay on my exercise bike, even when tightened down. I have a relatively wide seat on the bike, you have to have a full-on saddle I think for this to fit properly."
5,Wonderful,"This is an amazing workout DVD. It is tough, but I enjoy it because it helped me to lose a few inches from my hips. I love it! Thank you Cathe!"
3,Lost plants early,lost 3 out of the group the first year. not much flowering but the others seem to holding up ok. hope to get flowers this year.
2,Ick.,"I love travel writing in all its incarnations. However, this anthology, while well written, is about as exciting as a roll of damp paper towels. I say pass unless you like being lectured to by limp old men (a strange dearth of female writers is noted) on their own sense of self accomplishment."
5,"Great, Well Chosen Travel Essays","Another great in the Best American series. Bought it yesterday and have been ploughing through it. Loved Tad Friend's Segway piece as well as the John McPhee essay.Well chosen stuff, funny as well as insightful."
1,"You're having a dark week, if you find this entertaining.","Your average US movie is 90 minutes long. This was only about 75 minutes and the last 5 minutes was a random, out-of-nowhere rap video.This could have been a serious meditation on the forced choices of ex-cons. However, the main characters are not sympathetic ones. I felt like much of the dialogue was stolen from Nia Long's scenes in ""Soul Food."" The actors had no skills. I wonder if their scripts were posted to the floors or walls and just read out loud. This is supposed to take place in Louisiana, but you really don't get any of the local flavor from it. This film was very intentionally set in Any Ghetto, USA.The only thing I like was the main characters were cute. Their haircuts were perfect. One of them was sexy in that Busta Rhymes kind of way."
2,"it works fine, just smelly and god help you if you burn garlic","While the base of the product is great and VERY simple to clean out, the terra cotta 'top' is a pain in the butt (impossible to clean) and absorbs WICKED odors. after first use, the top had absorbed a huge volume of the oils used, and the scent permeated the cupboard. by the third use it smelled so bad it was almost intolerable, and then I burned a clove of garlic in it. (ugh) While the base does not absorb the odor at all due to its 'glazing/lining', the top is absolutely unusable now. i would not buy this product again unless it were fully glazed. i have an electric one that is super simple to clean and doesn't smell, and works in very swift time, so i'll stick with that one."
4,Does the job,"My garlic came out nice.I put a large one in it with olive oil.I used some and put the rest in the frig.I'm trying to think of other things I can use it for.I wonder if I can bake a apple in it.I like this,but it does not get a lot of use.Putting garlic in foil and baking it will also get the job done.it is well made,maybe I'll get creative and find other uses for it."
5,Perfect roasted garlic.,"I purchased the Norpro Garlic Baker and love it. Roasts much more evenly than roasting in foil. I slice the tops off of the garlic bulb (I roast 3 at a time), drizzle with a very small amount of olive oil, place a bay leaf on top. The kitchen fills up with a wonderful aroma. Good to use in garlic mashed potatoes or as a spread on crackers or crusty bread. I do soak the lid in water for 10 minutes which makes the garlic stay moist. Just purchased another as a gift for my daughter who loves garlic too! You will be very happy with this excellent product!"
5,Good for the Garlic Lover,"I got one for a gift years ago, and I just recently bought one for my mom for a gift. The design has not changed at all. This can fit 2-3 whole garlic bulbs in it, 4 if they are of a small size. It can also roast onions and apples according to the package, but I have never used mine for that. Maybe I will have to try that.The garlic turns out very mild and spreadable, like butter. Very nice. You can either bake in the oven or use in the microwave, but I suggest baking. It just turns out so much nicer.Clean up is a bit of a hassle because you can't put it in the dishwasher and you have to clean it by hand.This is a must if you are a garlic lover."
4,Not quite that color,"Don't let the illustration above fool you - this is a BLUE filter. It's pretty rad, though, and seems to work well."
2,The proud America,"So, USA journalists find out now that they are disturbing reality. Now? Logical. If you read this book and see that, making a fast history of american journalism, it is pointed out that, in the last years of XIX century, american press had a great development...Mr. Hearst was a liar. He invented a war. Invented brutalities never committed in Cuba. Great development? Yellow journalism? Tell the things by its name: no journalism. More than a hundred years ago.America is very proud of its journalism. It would better make only a glimpse of reality with other's eyes. Just walk half a mile with other's shoes. Now, from 11-S 2001, there are terrorists. But in the so-good, proudly-deep-and-systematic american journalism, basque terrorists in Spain have ever been, and remain being, ""liberation group (army) members"".Not so bad now. Not so good in the past."
4,The Sword and the Dragon,"An old movie that we used to watch on Million Dollar Movie back in New Jersey. It was ALWAYS on it seemed. An old turkey but we still used a bunch of lines from it even today. I was thinking about it and bought. It's a little different but still pretty funny. BUILD ME A MOUNTAIN OF MEN! And if you don't start cracking up when he says, HERE I STAND BEFORE YOU! something's wrong. Or the wind whistler. Too much.I can't wait for it to rain so I can put it back on & watch it like I used to."
1,The Sword and the Dragon,The movie is great. The quality of the tape is very bad. I am not satisfied with that.
1,Terrible audio quality,"Don't buy this one. I bought this thinking ""oh wow Freddie live."" The problem is the audio quality. It sounds like it was recorded with someone in the audience holding a hand held tape recorder. Try Burglar or Freddie King Blues Guitar Hero or The Best of Freddie King(the one produced by Leon Russell) instead."
4,No place like home,"Guardians indeed. For all those who enjoy their home and hearth close by - this is the book for you. It featurs the intense atmosphere associated with the caern, guidlines refering to pecuilar way each tribe (and the other be'te as well) views its caerns, expanded rules concerning those who always get left behind to caern-sit (the metis - including new gifts, merits and flaws, and deformities), and in-depth system about the building of the holiest of all places. Overall? not a bad piece at all. I think some expanding about the spirit totems and umbrascape could do no harm, but that note put aside, what you have here is a good book detailing (almost) everything you need to run a caern gaurding story. Or the building of one. Or its destruction. He he."
4,More indepth information some overlap,This book is great for a storyteller who wants to improve their knowledge about caerns. It provides ideas for developing different types of caerns not listed in the main books as well as adds to totems. THe book goes into more depth about positions in the caern and how probable it would be for a player character to take up one of the positions and what this might mean for your chronicle. There is still a lot of information that seems to overlap from other books in 2nd ed but which might have been removed in those same books in 3rd.
5,Great Insider Information,"A wonderful guide filled with lots of insider information, especially useful for those areas outside Acadia and Bar Harbor--such as exactly where to go on Cadillac Mountain for the best spot for the sunset. An essential guide for exploring the rest of Mt. Desert Island and the S. Penninsula. Some of the information about the local haunts is old now--Maggie's Restaurant, for example, has closed--but overall, it's filled with great advice and insight. Beautiful pictures, too! I only wish it had maps of the recommended trails. I would definitely get his other guides if I went to those parks."
4,Almost Perfect,"This is my second trip to Acadia, the first time was in childhood. I love to use guidebooks to navigate what is and isn't necessary to do in the park. This book was wonderful! It broke down every area of the island into sections then suggested restaurants, places to shop, the best sites, hikes, and provided a bit of history along with it. And the pictures were amazing. Highly recommend it. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because he doesn't discuss fishing in the area at all (besides fishing tours) and my husband is an avid fisherman so I had to look elsewhere for that information. But I will be buying more of his guidebooks in the future."
5,Excellent Book,This is a great book - we have been to Maine the last two years - in 2008 in the summer and 2009 in October for the fall foliage. It has alot of great information and is very helpful. Acadia National Park is awesome!
5,Great book for framework programmers.,"Since I do a lot of framework programming for .NET, this is a great book. In fact, I consider some of the conventions listed in this book to be good practice even when not using .NET."
4,Must-own book for any class library developer.,"The new book from Brad Abrams and Krzysztof Cwalina is a must-have book for anyone writing .NET and Mono code.The book includes many of the design guidelines that Brad's blog is famous for. The book is not just a collection of rules, but it also includes the rationale for some of the design decisions and what really makes the book interesting are the commentaries from other developers and architects involved in .NET.This book is packed with gems."
5,Excellant Work!!,This book is not just for people developing frameworks but also for Application programmers who use frameworks. If you donot know how frameworks are designed then you wont be really efficient in using it.I also use thier Naming Guidelines in our software development team just to create a standard. Overall a class work. Kudos to Brad et al.
4,Cant wait to see the next version,"I think this is a must read for every developer (beginner or expert) to follow patterns and guidelines in all projects, irrespective of technology being used for programming - This book is specific for .NET only - I love it!"
4,Perfect book for architecting frameworks,"Book has perfect guidelines for the ""layout"" of designing a framework."
5,A magical film!,"This was a marvellous adaptation of ""Twelfth Night"" -- indeed, one of the best Shakespeare adaptations I've ever seen. Imogen Stubbs was absolutely brilliant as Viola -- I found the scene where she confesses her love to Orsino without his knowing it heartbreakingly poignant, (""My father had a daughter ...""), yet there were plenty of laughs in the absurd situations. Nigel Hawthorne was also incredible -- both funny and somehow pathetic in his delusions."
5,Shakespeare is fun,Reading Shakespeare is different than seeing Shakespeare and this movie makes things fun. It's a wonderful movie with a great cast that captures the humor and wit of Shakespeare's play. Imogen Stubbs is fantastic. It's really too bad this is not out on DVD.
3,Sorry.,Nothing against the movie itself but I really didn't like the actress who played Viola. Just not believable to me. I liked the play I saw in college better.
1,For those who find KING LEAR too cheerful,"This dismal film conveys scarcely any hint that the play on which it is based is a comedy. Many of the jokes are gone, and the survivors are damped down--if you are not already familiar with the play, you will not realize that they ARE jokes. Moreover, the play's theme--which may, with extreme succinctness, be expressed as ""you have to keep on enjoying life, even if bad things happen""--has been replaced by one of ""remember, you must die."" The atmosphere is solemn, with death and decay omnipresent. In brief, this is TWELFTH NIGHT as interpreted by Malvolio. You may be tempted to watch it anyway, because of the many fine actors in the cast, but their efforts are suffocated in the general gloom."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I received a DVD that did not play. I contacted the company and nobody got back to me. I wanted to purchase this DVD and asked them to re-send a copy. I heard nothing from the company. I, instead, received a refund in the mail from Amazon in a few days. This is less my postage. I feel that if a vendor does not ship what was ordered, postage should be refunded."
2,Too bad................,"I love Shakespear's comedies and would very much like to have this one, but previous reviewers have prevented me from making a mistake in purchasing it, as there are no subtitles!! I cannot understand dialogs any longer (used to, years ago), so the film would be of no use to me. Too bad.Why don't DVD producers get wise? They are ""cutting off their noses to spite their faces"" by not providing English sub-titles."
2,Twelth Night,Didn't like this movie at all. It became very cumbersome and boring. I enjoyed Shakespeare in Love so much better.
4,A fun and light-hearted movie,"Thought the movie was a lot of fun. Helena (as usual) played the character very well. Due to the fact that I'm not much of a 'Shakespearan', it took a couple of viewings to understand some of the dialogue. Well worth a look, especially if you are a shakespeare fan! Even if you're not, it still is a nice, light-hearted romantic comedy!"
5,The wait is over,"I waited for years for this movie to be released on DVD. The cast is terrific, it is directed by Trevor Nunn who also directed ""Cats"" on Broadway, and the scenery is wonderful. There are limited ""extras"" but I didn't care about that."
4,twelfth night,Twelfth night was one of the most interesting movie I've watched in my high school years. It was very understandable since it was difficult to follow with the play. It helped me with my puppet show that I had to do. It was an excellent movie.
4,"Amusing, but confusing","I loved this movie, but the firsst half hour is incredibly confusingf and unclear, and fairly inaccurate with regards to the play. Although I enjoyed the whole movie, those who started watching it with me soon left(this was a college dorm) those who came in later, once it picked up were fascinated as well. It definitely rewards rewatching, as much becomes clearer the second or third time round. I haunted video stores hoping for a cheap second hand version to buy, as i couldn't find it anywhere else. The acting is good, cineamatography beautiful, a fun movie."
2,hmmm.,This movie was quite hard to understand. And it seemed a bit gay at times.. Not somthing i would watch again. I liked Helena Bonham carter much better in room with a view!
4,Or As You Will,This is funny as hell! Read the play first so tht you can fully enjoy it. I haven't seen any other films about this play but this one is really good.
4,Fun and silly,"Shakepeare seemed to love these farces with women masquerading as men and everyone in love with the wrong person. They are not my favorites, but Twelfth Night has some lovely poetry in it and is worth seeing."
3,Decent Adaptation,"This is a very tolerable incarnation of Shakespeare's most well-known comedies.It was rather boring for around the first half an hour, but then it started getting funny. Some of the characters aren't quite what they are like in the play, but it doesn't really hurt it at all.The acting quality ranges from descent to good, and I think Helena Bonham Carter did a splended job as Olivia.The timeframe was put forewards around 200 years, but it didn't hurt any.Overall, I think that it is a good production and worth seeing."
4,Teenage daughter loves this.,My daughter asked me to get this for her. she watches it over and over. She ordered the book as well. She discovered it on You Tube and asked for the hard copy DVD so that she could enjoy it more and own it.
5,Love this movie,"My daughters and I love this version of Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night."" It is a fun way to introduce kids to Shakespeare and a good movie. At the heart of the plot is a girl pretending to be a boy AND she has to look exactly like her brother. They managed to find an actress who could pull it off. Tough casting assignment. The supporting actors are all a plus. We quote lines from this movie/play all the time. It is a fun movie."
5,A movie to remember!,"This is a movie that will stick with you. I watched it for the first time some time ago when I was really young, and I held on to it fro as long as I could remember wanting to see it again. In my opinion it's one of the BEST Shakespeare adaptations (or at least the one I most enjoyed) from book to film. It was also the first movie I had ever seen Helena Bonham Carter in, and I've loved everything she's been in since.The comedy isn't too over the top, and the story is presented in a way that even if you never read Shakespeare's play, you can appreciate the movie on its own for what it is. Honestly, I look forward to introducing my son to Shakespeare by was of this movie and a few others. I just believe it was that well done!"
2,Problems with color transfer to DVD version,"Many previous reviewers have praised this film, in particular the VHS version. I am in their camp, but having recently purchased the DVD version, due to a cassette accident, I have to say that the DVD version is a poor substitute. The DVD release is awash in a red tint, and many scenes are simply too dark to view. Such a pity, as I originally found the cinematography in this film spectacular."
4,Twelfth Smile,"This film is loaded with humorous confusion, mistaken identity, confused gender and well meaning people with all the right weaknesses to make most of us feel right at home. Out of a tragic ending a bright and amazing beginning is born, where, through love and desire, those who deserve everything good are rewarded and those who deserve it are brought low, and all endure hard learned lessons on life and love, so by the film's conclusion we can see that we're not so different after all...and neither are our hopes and dreams....and in a very special way, we come to believe that the best of times can be born out of the worst of times.... In a word ""Wonderful"" :)"
5,Awesome!!,"I am a huge fan of Shakespeare, and this particular movie is an adaptation of my favorite play of his. I really enjoy the way the actors portray these characters and feel like they were made for these roles. Ben Kingsley is incredible as Feste the fool!!"
5,Great CD,"This cd has been such a blessing these guys sound great together the new name of the group now is ""FORTITUDE"", their most recent Cd is just as good."
4,One of the great unheard of's,I think this is good CD a friend gave it me to listen I never heard from these guys before ut this CD s very good.
4,"New Label, New CD, Parnell's guitar playing soars.","Play that guitar Lee Roy! Parnell dropped by Arista Nashville is now with Vanguard Records. The change in labels is for the better, as Arista was attempting to make Lee Roy a country star. Vanguard has never been a label that worries about radio play and Lee Roy has recorded a CD of more than just 3:00 minute songs. Parnell has always been known as a good slide guitar player but not until this CD has he cut loose in the studio. Parnell like his friend, Delbert McClinton are what you might call Americana artists - their roots and their playing span country to rock. Except for a couple of throw away songs about Texas, this CD is superb. We can only hope that Vanguard will allow Parnell to develop as an artist."
4,You can take the boy out of the country but.....!,"Like Willie Nelson (Milk Cow Blues), Lee Roy Parnell has taken a time out from his usual country recordings and ventures into the blues. However, unlike the covers CD performed by Willie, Parnell pens nine originals out of the ten songs offered on the CD. Also, unlike Willie, Parnell limits his ""friends"" to just a few including, Keb Mo's overdub on ""I Declare"", Bonnie Bramlett on ""Breaking Down Slow"" and Delbert McClinton on ""South by Southwest"".As usual, Parnell's guitar work is smooth and engaging and his vocals are, well...country. In fact, the truth is that while this is a good CD, Parnell strays only slightly from his country roots and the result is a country blues CD with the emphasis on ""country"". The results should please his followers but will not win over any fans of modern electric blues. Two of the better tracks are ""South by Southwest"" and ""Loves Been Rough On Me""."
5,Give it one more try...,"First I thought this was less. Then I found it was actually more. Greatest album he did, I think. Great one for southern rockers too. Get it!"
3,Lee Roy Tears it Up,"So there I was, on a layover in Chicago during (lucky for me)the Chicago blues festival. Saw Lee Roy's name on the bill and wondered what a country boy was doing in Americs's premiere blues city....After the opening chords of ""right where it hurts"" it was obvious! Lee Roy explained that the major labels continually discouraged him expressing himself in a way other than the top 40 country format,and this was his ""coming out party"". Ya had to feel his pain....All in all, this CD satisfies in the way old sweatshirts do, comforting and familiar. Buy it."
4,HD Recording for Muscians Review,I was looking for some information on getting all my equipment working together when I stumbled across this book. Though it's not the nuts and bolt I needed it did cover many subjects that arise when setting up and using a recording studio. It takes the technical aspects of audio and simplifies them. From mic to CD it hits every step. Great book for anyone interested in audio recording of any type.
2,Missionary Appeal (with a few historical bits),"If you're scouting out interesting historical bits concerning 1920's Japan, this book has some use, and I genuinely enjoyed the accounting of the Matsuyama Working Girls' Home, just as a local history issue. I tried to find any information as to its eventual fate on the web, but no luck.But the book is very moralistic and slanted. It's is basically an appeal for Christian missionary work in Japan, how Christianity can transform labor conditions for working women. If you're digging for source material, this may be worth reading, otherwise skip."
2,jesi's thoughts,"I can't believe blew her off like that. I know that he might be better friends with Chet, but he could have at least talked to him and her about it. I did feel better when Fiona became her partner, even though that's all they thought about. But the way Aimee and her threw that party was awesome! Especially since Ivy dressed in a mini and almost let everyone see England and France!"
3,Unusual plot.,"Miss Gillian Giles can combat a suitor's unwanted embrace with deadly efficiency. But after being caught in a compromising situation with Damon Ryder, one that could irreparably ruin her reputation, she is dismayed when he unhesitatingly offers marriage.Gilly believes marriage to Damon, the season's most eligible bachelor, would be impossible, but Damon is equally determined to convince her otherwise.I'm not into heroines that 'look a gift horse in its' mouth' but, as heroines go, Gilly was OK and it was an interesting enough tale."
2,Not designed well,"This item was pictured with the bread keeper, but it does not fit in the keeper. The slicer item is way too tall, and there is not a bread knife out there that works with it. Would not buy this product or recommend it to breadlovers!"
2,oversized,"The bread slicer is oversized for a standard 10"" bread knife making it difficult to stay in the guide slots of the plastic. Knives beyond this size are hard to find. The concept is great and I would love it to be 2"" narrower."
3,slices too thick,"Not a bad product if you want thick slices. I make a mixture of unbleached and whole wheat bread, and it is very substanial, and so want to slice it thinner. I wish it could be 1/4"". I just can't see eating that thick of bread. It does not seem like there is anything available that is adjustable. Too bad, I won't be using this product very much."
2,not what i expected,"I bake my own bread, and I slice it with a sharp bread knife, the slices sometimes do not come out as thin as I want, thats why I thought a bread slicing guide would be the perfect solution. I ordered the Norpro guide, because I like Norpro and I have bought so many useful tools from them, not this time though, the guide is much bigger that my loaf, that makes the loaf go back and forth with the knife, you will have to press hard on the bread to keep it in place, but the bigger problem is that the slices come out too thick, I could make thinner slices with out the guide, thats why I stopped using it and went back for the manual slicing, I even tried an electric knife, but I still think manual slicing is the best, it gives you control and good results."
2,Bread slicer disappointment,"This slicer is flimsy. The plastic end keeps falling off, and the wood is super soft and easily cut. My husband slices most of our bread and he complains that the slicing guide is so wide that it is difficult to find a knife long enough. I do like the crumb catcher."
2,BREAD SLICER,THIS PRODUCT WAS DEFINITELY NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. I MAKE MY OWN BREAD SO I WANTED TO HAVE UNIFORM SLICES. YOU GET THEM BUT THEY ARE WAY TO FAT. HALF THE SIZE WOULD BE PERFECT.
2,Sappy and brittle,"This guide gives you even slices from almost any size loaf, but the unfinished wood bleeds sap in puddles and the plastic is so brittle you have to be very careful when you're cutting. Brush up against the guide posts with the knife and more often than not you're going to break at least one. Mine lasted 6 months before I had to replace it."
3,Nice but could be better,"I love the cutting guide for even slices. The grooved bottom is great for catching crumbs but most fall out from the sides. I use a serrated knife for smooth cutting and it cuts into the wooden bottom. For me,it would be better if there were grooves in the wood for the knife blade also. This would enable me to cut through breads with a tough crust on the bottom and not cut cut through the wood. Cleaning it is not an easy task...I recommend using a soft brush instead of washing with water."
4,I love it.,"I love this slicer guide, but your bread knife must be a minimum of 10"" long or it won't fit to the other side of the guide. Other than that, oh and the screws coming unscrewed from the sides, it is a great product."
4,Slice and Crumb Catcher,"The Norpro 370 is an interesting gadget. It does slice your bread accurately as promised. However, it is a little challenging to clean with sticky breads like banana bread. After removing the crumbs from the device, I use disinfecting wipes to remove most of the residue, and a wet paper towel to remove what is left over. Let it air dry and store away."
4,Just get the extra long bread knife,"I bake a lot of bread, that is why I purchased this bread slicer. It works well and cleans up great, but if you do not use the extra long bread knife you might as well forget it."
2,Bread Slicer,I use the bread slicer everyday. You have to be careful with it. I broke one of the plastic guides very easily. Wish they had a sturdier model.
1,national security,don't bother trying to order this thing if you live in canada... apparently you might be a terrorist or something and they can't ship it to you... don't waste your time and go find a nice canadian source for a similar product.miffed? you bet!
3,Norpo Bread Slicer,"Slicer works ok, however the wood base cheesy and won't hold up if the knife cuts into it."
4,BEST OF THREE,Best of the 3 other bread slicing guides I bought.Big enough for 2 lb. Bread machine loafs THE BIGIST PLUS..
1,a poor quality product,The item came damaged-the slats on one side were not glued and just hung loose. Very dissapointing product. I bought several itmes over the last year this is the worst.
1,I did better with a knife,"Cheap plastic fins, easily broken. After three uses, this one hit the garbage can. Don't waste your money! get a good sharp knife!"
1,Very Poorly Made!!,"This thing has been an aggravating waste. The person or persons who designed this obviously suffer from Anal - Cranial Inversion syndrome. The choice to use acrylic for the tines was a disaster as they break constantly and I keep super gluing them back on. Doesn't fit my bread (too wide) and I had to find 12 in. knife to use it. Too short the other way and i have to stop cutting, pull out 1/4 of the sliced bread and move loaf down again to finish cutting the bread. I find it outrageous that someone would attempt to market such a poorly designed piece of junk. These people don't even care if it works as long as they can make some money off it!! A couple weeks of using a prototype would have told them how wrongly conceived a product this is!!! This thing is just downright stupid!!!"
3,Good but not sure how long it will last.,It arrived in a timely manner and was easy to assemble. The first few uses confused me as the plastic back panel kep falling out. I finally determined that one of the wooden sides had never been glued together. Some corner clamps and wood glue solved the problem and the bread slices evenly if you have a good bread knife with a long enough blade to cover the somewhat wide width. The lack of proper assembly of the crumb catcher box may have been one in a million. Chances are yours will be fine.
5,Perfect slices!,"This is a great tool for homemade bread! The first slice is a little thick (great heel piece), but the rest are perfect so if you're going to need to slice more than one, it's handy to do it all at once. I love the crumb catcher, keeps most of the messy crumbs off of my counter. The only thing I'm a little worried about is the wood is a little soft. I'm afraid after excessive use with my serrated bread knife it might become too badly damaged to keep using... but so far it's fine!"
1,Not worth the money,Very disappointed by this purchase. I wish we never purchased it and now that we've used it we are stuck with it!
2,Should have heeded the warnings,"I've used this product a couple of weeks. Although it seemed flimsy at first, I found a serrated knife in my kitchen that was long enough to work well with the guide. The flimsiness continued to be bothersome, but I was getting perfect slices from my cuts! However, tonight while I was cutting a slice, one of the plastic guides broke off as I brought the knife back through it. I'm extremely disappointed."
1,Flimsy not worth the money.,"Very disappointed in this product. It falls apart everytime you try to slice a piece of bread. The wooden crumb box gouges very easily as well. Just a piece of flimsy plastic. :( I ended up buying a much less expensive bread keepr that came with a slicing guide, about half the price and it works great :)"
2,Falls apart and breaks easily,"I really wanted to like this bread slicer, since the price is so reasonable and it is attractive. The first problem was that the front piece of acrylic came loose and fell out, multiple times. We used cellophane packaging tape to fix that. The second problem was the first slicing guide tab snapping off. We think this happened because the guide is far too wide for a standard 2 pound bread machine loaf sliced with a 10 inch bread knife. When another tab broke we started looking for a better bread slicer, and found the Presto Bread Slicing Guide Model 08615, which is made to fit bread machine loaves. There is one for 64.95 on Amazon, but I found a gently used one on the mother of all auction sites for less than $25. It is sturdy, constructed in one piece, easy to clean, and is the right size for bread machine loaves. We can use either a regular 10 inch bread knife or an electric knife without bumping into the tabs on the backside of the guide."
3,First one was broken,This is a neat product but the wooden base of the first one arrived in pieces. I reordered it and the second one is perfect. This was a gift so I couldn't try it out and comment on how it works.
3,its ok,"This product serves its purpose. It is cheap, the slice guide within the plastic to not stay in place, they move so I have to hold it together, still making the bread a little uneven"
2,Crumb catcher,I did not give the product a very high rating as it is cheaply made. Wood slats are just glued on and come loose very easily. I can not compare this to any other bread slice/crumb catcher as I have not tried other ones.
3,Not very useful without electric knife,"I bought an automatic bread machine for New Year, and after a few breads, was conviced I needed more than just a knife to cut nice, thin slices. This bread slicer helps to some extent, but 1) the plastic is too soft to really resist the knife if it gets out of the guides, 2) my knife is not long enough to go through the guides on both sides and still sig-saw. I assume it would be perfect with an electric knife, but then still, this looks like a cumbersome way of cutting bread."
1,Broke the first try,"I am a bed and breakfast owner, and one of my specialties is apple stuffed French toast with Vermont maple syrup. I am a farm to table business, and I buy whole loaves from a nearby organic farm. I wanted a slicing guide to help me cut straight slices so I would stop wasting bread. This guide broke the first time I used it. The slicer requires a very long bread knife (which I have) However on the second cross stroke, the knife escaped the slot and bumped the acrylic slice guide on the backstroke. There was no real pressure, but the guide tooth snapped off. I sent it back because once I examined the structure I realized that there is nothing but a little strip of plastic holding the slicing guide teeth to the base. The plastic is too brittle for the job."
3,"Works Great, But Not Durable","This bread slicer guide works great, but is not durable. The guide looks nice and functions pretty well as long as your loaf of bread is small or medium in size from the oven or bread maker. If your loaf is wider than typical it will not fit. The bread guide is easy to clean, just lift the top and dump out the crumbs. Unfortunately it is not durable at all. If you by accident are cutting the bread at a slant, which is very easy to do, or slip when cutting after a few misses the plastic guides break off. This is the third time we have bought this bread guide, its cheapest and they are all the same basically, in eighteen months because we have by accident cut off the plastic guides."
4,Bread Slicer,"This works very well. I have used it many times and it holds up well and is easy to clean. If I had to change anything I would like to see it have an additional set of sides that would make thinner slices of bread. The slices come out a little thick. That is not a bad thing, but there are times when I would like to have thinner. Other than that it works very well for my bread and I would recommend it for the price."
3,Not As Useful As It Looks,"I am a bread baker and thought this item may be a good way to cut my bread slices straighter. Found out one size does not fit all. My bread loaves are smaller than this item and the sides of the slicer are not adjustable. if you could slide the sides of this in to fit the width of the bread loaves it be a great idea, but trying to stabilize your bread from slipping defeats the purpose of this cutter.Don't like this item and I won't use it. It is easier to just cut my bread on a bread board without a bread slicer guide. Just one of those things to buy for the person who has everything and needs nothing. My daughter said she saw one at the Salvation Army store for $2.00. Oh well, I guess that is where mine will end up. It may be nice for people but doesn't work for me. I'll just keep slicing my own bread the way I always have. I'll find someone go give it to or something else to use it for."
3,norpro bread slicer okay for money,"The grooves are too large and because I use my electric knife to carve my bread, it cuts down into the wood. Also, I tried using my manual bread knife and I also had to be careful of not cutting down too far--have to take bread off slicer and finish cutting thus defeating the crumb catching feature"
3,Bread Slicer,Some of my bread is taller than the sides of the guide and you have to cut into the wood base to cut all the way thru the bread. The slices are a little thick for sandwiches. It would be nice if the bottom was recessed where you could cut all the way thru. It looks nice and I like the crumb catcher feature.
3,Not Outstanding,"This works OK, but the openings are a bit tight when using a decent or a good bread knife to cut your bread. Not horrible - just not great."
4,Bread slicer,"Handy device, except it requires a very long knife to reach from the grooves on one side over to the other side. So I had to buy a new knife just for this purpose, and none of the loaves I bake are as wide as the slicer."
3,bread slicing guide,The only problem that I had with this bread slicer was that it seems a little to wide. I have a standard bread knife but when you are cutting the bread the knife comes out of the guides.
5,Great bread slicer.,It's a nice bread slicer. I also bought 10 inch bread knife because my 8 inch knife wasnt long enough. I've used it for a couple of months and it's held up great. I can see how it could be damaged easily if your knife isn't long enough or you handle it a little rough.
2,Not a good procuct for bread machine bread...,"I bought this item because I recently fell in love with baking bread in a bread machine. Bread machine loaves are shaped so that when laid in the slicer they reach the top, and make it very difficult to line the knife up in the slots. I found the plastic part itself to be much flimsier than I had anticipated, and the crumb catcher has missed many crumbs, which end up on the counter top. I wish I could say this is a great product, because I have found no other options for uniformly slicing bread machine bread, but I am greatly disappointed."
4,Simple and effective,"This product did everything I wanted it to do. It's simple and easy to use and store. I only wish the slots were narrower for thinner slices, but they are standard width."
1,Poor craftsmanship,This bread slicer broke the second time I used it. The wooden frame is delicate and did not hold up to slicing with a serrated knife. The wood is unfinished (not sealed) and will likely harbor microorganisms. Definitely not worth the money. Amazon should be ashamed to sell this product.
2,bread cutter,it does not work like I thought it would lhe slices come out too big and the knife keeps comming out from between the slots
1,totally crap,"This is flimsy. The sides are not sturdy so you have to hold the guide or the bread to make a decent slice. Then when you do, you still end up cutting yourself--I did. Lesson learned. Also, the slices are twice that of normal sandwich slices. The slices end up being close to one inch-- way too big. The crumb catcher is good. In fact it is the only redeemable part on the product. So, now, the slicing guide is off this thing and once again I am 'eyeballing it'-- but saving myself extra clean up by using the crumbcatcher. Not worth the price."
5,Best Slice Guide your money can buy,"This thing works perfectly with my 8"" electric knife. I'm so glad that I didn't listen to those bad reviews, it almost sounded like they got a totally different product. Well, who cares, let me go home and enjoy my most fresh daily bread now."
3,decent guide,i bought this in the attempt to get more even slices it does well but you need a long bread knife other wise u only get an inch or two of cutting space if you have a shorter knife like i do then you will end up pulling out of the guide on one side and if your not carefull you can snap the guides its just acrylic plastic which is brittle but is a sturdier plastic then say plexi glass
2,bread slicer,"The bread slicer is a good idea, but the plastic started breaking off the first week I got it. The slicer needs to be made of metal. The slicing board is handy & does catch the crumbs good."
1,Looks good but isn't,"The plastic slots are very fragile and break off easily. The cutting surface is very soft and gets gouges in it easily. I expected to like this with the longer Chicago Cutlery bread knife, but the product is beyond useless."
2,Bread slicer,"There is nothing to hold the bread load steady while slicing. It works, but is more hassle than holding the loaf and slicing it yourself on a bread board. May work better with regular baked bread as opposed to bread machine loaf because of shape."
3,Slices to Thick,"over all the unit is built well and will last. 2 complaints #1 the slices are to thick, bread machine bread tends to be dense and the slices just come out to thick for sandwiches #2 It slides, it needs little rubber pads on the bottom to keep it from sliding."
3,You need a long knife!,"So far, so good. This bread slicer does everything it promises and seems well-made. Please note, you will need a long bread knife or an electric knife to use this slicing guide! My bread knife (which isn't too terribly short) just spanned the width of the slicing guide, but with the back-and-forth sawing action required to cut bread - my knife was too short to stay within the guide's slots. My electric knife works great with this slicing guide as there is no sawing. Otherwise, make sure your breadknife has a blade that is as long as this guide is wide PLUS 3 inches or so."
2,Bread slices are like wedges,The bread slices are very thick. I would not recommend this slicer to my friends. The slicer takes up a lot of room to store.
3,Ok but still makes a mess,"This is a decent product but without the right knife it's kind of pointless. We have had this for a few years and hardly use it anymore. Whenever we did use it, crumbs would still end up all over the counter and the slices never cut really well. It's a really good idea and I think with a really really good bread knife we would have had a lot more success but if you just try and use a regular knife or a cheap bread knife it doesn't work too well."
1,Another piece of junk in my house,"Ditto previous reviewers. End piece kept falling off, so I glued it in place. My 8"" knife is too short and keeps leaving the slots and breaking them off. The only upside is that I have discovered a good plastic glue in the process. Amazon, please remove this product from your virtual shelves so others won't be duped too."
2,what a waste,"catches some crumbs.. sides are cheap plastic spread too far apart to hold knife... waste of money, waste of time"
1,NO SCREWS! ARRRRG,"Got this for my hubby for his new ""bread making"" hobby. We haven't used it yer but very disappointed that we did not get any screws with the package. We opened it on a cupboard after everyone left. It was the only item he opened at that time and we searched everywhere twice and found no screws. I am now worried that it will be stable enough to use and that is assuming I can find proper screws for it. I may just opt to return it and get a different one."
3,Bread Slicer Cuts Corners,This bread slicer serves the purpose for which it was purchased but has several drawbacks. My standard size breadknives do not fit readily across the unit to slice easily through the slots from side to side. Also the front panel has fallen out of its slots during use since it is not held in place very tightly. However it is a decent basic bread slicer for light use in the kitchen.
2,Not Very Stable,I've already tossed this out. The ends never lined up properly and the entire thing was quite wobbly.
4,Norpro Bread Slicer with Crumb Catcher,"This helped to cut the bread but the big difference was a knife. If you don't have at least a 12"" blade it's still very difficult to cut. The sides could be stiffer but I do like the guides."
2,Hard to use,This was a little hard to use. I have a very long bread knife and I still had trouble sawing through the bread while keeping it within the plastic guides. The crumb catcher is nice...but I ended up cutting the bread without the slicer. Maybe it just takes some getting used to...
4,Slicing the bread,Works well - needs a really long knife to stay within guides. It is also helpful to allow bread to cool before attempting to slice.
4,Does What it Says,"Well, what can I say? It's a guide for slicing bread. That's what it does. How hard can that be? I give it four stars. With a couple of changes I would give it five stars...It would be nice if the slots were closer together so you could slice the bread thinner. If you wanted thick slices you could always use every other slot. As it is, you don't have a choice. The acrylic guides attach to the wood base with screws, which makes it difficult to clean. It also takes up a lot of space when storing.Even without those changes it does what it's supposed to do... hold the bread and guide the knife while you slice."
4,bread slicer,"It works very well. It does take up a lot of space in my cupboard. I wish it was capable of being able to fold down or take apart easily. I would have liked thinner slices also. I think the electric slicers work better, but they are expensive."
5,It Works Great But...,"Make sure you have a 10 inch bread knife for this slicer. I ordered one at the same time I ordered the slicer, after viewing other people's complaints about their bread knife not being long enough. I also ordered an acrylic bread keeper that has a small cutting board that fits perfectly in the slicer, so there are no issues with the knife cutting into the wood.I did have a problem with the bread slices being thicker than I wanted, and now I just move the bread slightly back from the guide to make them thinner. No problems at all and I love having nice, even, slices for sandwiches. Great product...it does the job, just get the right knife for it."
5,You know you need it,"Without this thing, slicing bread at home is a hit or miss affair.There are a half dozen or so slots on this device suggesting you could slice nearly half a loaf before removing the slices. Multiple slicing did not work very well for me, but removing each single slice yields a perfect slice every time. You do need a serrated knive (not included)."
3,does the job,"It does what it is supposed to, guide the bread knife for an even slice. However, it is a bit wobbly. I'll have to get longer screws to hold the plexiglass (or silicone) to the wood. I don;t forsee a long future for this item! The crumb catcher is fine. Overpriced!"
1,Broke after 3rd use,"The 2 times I used it I thought ""Wow!"" loved that I could slice even slabs of bread. Then on the 3rd time, one of the acrylic prongs broke. Now, no more even bread. Not worth the money I paid. Should have purchased the wood slicer. Should return, but it's not worth it."
5,bread cutting board for consistant slices,Am very pleased with the bread slicer with the crumb cathcer.Using a bread knife on the wood keeps the knife in good condition.
3,nice idea but...,"allows you to cut your bread nice and straight, but the wood is so soft after the first use you have a score in the wood that will only get deeper and I think about the saw dust on my bread?"
3,not bad,"it was alittle fragile. when you cut the bread, you cut the wooden base also. you have to choose a very long knife or bread cutter."
2,It didn't have all the parts,"It should have worked, and probably will once I go to the hardware store and buy screws that won't hurt the plastic. I received a wooden cutting board and plastic guide. I thought the guide set into grooves on the cutting board. There are holes in the plastic where there should be short screws to screw it into the wood. No screws. Can't use it with the guide and I'm baking homemade bread and don't want huge slices. Actually i do want huge slices, this is to prevent that."
2,Will work with some modifications,"I agree with the user who stated that the Norpro 370 Bread Slicerand Guide with Crumb Catcher is a little too wide for the bread that comes out of most bread machines I resolved that problem by taking some measurements and getting out my Dremel tools. A few cuts here and there along with some sanding, some glue and some small nails and humpty dumpty was put back together again and was just the right size too. Now it works great!"
2,Missing Parts!!!,Not too pleased that the slicer and guide with crumb catcher came without some of the parts. There are 4 screws that hold the plastic part to the wooden part and they were not provided in the box. Very strange!
2,Not worth the money,"It's not worth the money. No where does it say ""assembly required"". Slicing between the slots is too difficult. The bread keep moving."
1,just pecies of pine and plastic,"One thing that wasn't mentioned in the specs about this product was assembly. What came in the box were six pieces of pine (neatly cut, I admit), three pieces of plastic and five smalll screws. No instructions. All you need is glue, nails or screws, the nesessary tools: hammer screwdriver, several clamps along with some woodworking skill. I sent it back!"
3,bread slicer,"ok great idea, but needs a little improvement. this allows the crumbs to shoot out when cutting,it does catch most of the crumbs, but to be move afficient needs to have more room in the back to catch the crumbs that fly off when cutting or have more room on the base to catch so maybe have the base larger than the top. I do like it but have to keep a towel underneath to catch the flying debri. overall a good product"
2,Wish this worked,This is cute. I sure wish it worked. It is way too wide for my bread and my knife. I figure it is so wide so it can fit a variety of breads but I have to anchor my loaf when slicing... and doesn't help that my knife isn't long enough. Very frustrating to use.The tines make little larger than 1/2 inch slices -too thick for my liking. The tines are also very flimsy. Haven't had any break yet but I am Very careful.Cute idea but doesn't work.
2,No Wonder,"It is no wonder the product doesn't do better, it takes a longer knife than most bread knives. We have two bread knives and they are both too short to fit in the slots of both sides. DUH!"
2,Norpro bread slicer,This is a nice looking and easily assembled piece but the slices are quite thick and one needs a long bread knife for it to work successfully.
3,Norpro Bread Slicer,"Rather clunky, needs extra care, long bread knife and continuous adjustment to slice a whole loaf."
1,Norpro Bread Slicer,"I returned this item. If there had been a better description i.e. length, width etc, I would not have ordered it."
3,Bread slicer works for you,It works well and does catch the crumbs. Keeps the slices even. Just wished it was foldable making it easier to store in the bread drawer. Really like the convenience.
3,"it's ok, so so.",this accessory is better that cutting freehand with a knife but still a challenge to keep the slices uniform. I've been using an electric knife with my Norpro and it works ok. the wood base is soft wood so you need to be aware not to slice too deeply. would I buy this again? yes.
1,Just OK,The bread slicer seemed like a good idea but did not live up to its potential. As other reviewers experienced the plastic guide broke after I sliced 6 or 7 slices of bread. The plastic slice guides are way to flimsy. The 10 inch bread knife I ordered along with the bread slicer is great and you do need at least a 10 inch knife to use the bread slicer.
3,OK,"What canyou say, it's a piece of wood with slits for slicing bread evenly. Works OK, if you bread cutting blade is long enough if not it will not give you uniformed slices."
1,Poor design makes product not worth using,"When the Bread Slicer and Crumb Catcher arrived, I immediately put it together and noticed some problems. The screw holes on the sides of the item were machined poorly, so I couldn't get the screws in tight enough to hold the acrylic slicing guide in place. From that point, the product was pretty much useless. I did like the crumb catcher, and may keep it without the slicing guide, but I really wanted to be able to do both.The product could be improved 2 ways. The screw holes could be moved up on the sides so that the angle of the acrylic guide isn't so steep. That way, the sides would be stabilized, and three screws per side, instead of two, would also be a big help. It's a good idea, but lacks in its implementation. I give it one star, because I can't use it as is."
2,Manual bread slicer,"plastic side broke within weeks of delivery. Still using it, but disappointed in quality of unit. Would not purchase again."
4,Nice Bread Slicer,"This bread slicer works very well. The slices may be a bit thick for some people. I like the wood base versus the old plastic base. Overall, I'd advise shoppers to try it. I couldn't fine anything like it in the stores."
2,now I need a longer bread knife,"We received this as a gift and it was easy to put together...BUT...the space for bread is so wide that our current bread knife (standard Cutco) is too short to use it effectively with the slicer. If we put the handle all the way through the guide so the handle touches the plastic, the tip only sticks out one inch on the other side. So when you slice the bread, the knife keeps hitting the guide."
2,Very Poor Product,I feel it does not enable me to slice bread anwhere near as well as another product that a friend had let me try.
2,No instructions,Thank god I have a very handy husband. This product came with no instructions or glue to put this together and it needed to be put together. I thought you'd like to know this for future use.
2,Disappointed,"When I received the bread slicer it was coming apart but instead of shipping it back I screwed it together, no big deal. Once assembled and ready to use I became even more disappointed. The slicer is much wider than the width of the bread and does not hold the loaf firmly for slicing. In addition, it is so wide that a long bread knife will not stay within the slicing guides, thus making slicing the bread even more difficult. I am very disappointed in this product. I should ship it back but it is not worth the hassel."
1,Flimsy,"When I purchased this item, I thought it was going to make life easier slicing my homemade bread. Not the case at all. The guides are a VERY FLIMSY acrylic. Constantly hitting them with the knife and three weeks into using this item, (3 loaves of bread and at the cost of 19.99), I was slicing the bread when one of the ""fins"" snapped right off. I then at that point started scouring the internet for something a little more durable. Found a few used items that LOOKED better, but nothing I was sure enough to buy. I ended up coming across a suggestion someone had in one of the forums and they suggested an electric knife. They said their experience was better control. Well, I bit the bullet, went to Walmart and bought a Black & Decker electric knife for a whole $9.99. That was a good three years ago and haven't looked back since. Best suggestion anyone ever gave imo."
2,adequate...barely..,"i got this despite the negative reviews because i really needed a bread slicer. after the first couple uses it moved to the cabinet below the sink. the thing felt cheap, i didn't find the plastic guides very useful, didn't stabilize the bread as i was cutting which was kind of the point of getting this... i was pretty disappointed. i just wish there was a better option out there made by a quality company. would agree with other reviewers that this is a waste of time and money."
2,Bread slicer,"Not quite as happy with this product as I thought I would be. The main problem with it is that the end piece falls out all the time when you are trying to slice the bread. It is a really good idea, but a bit difficult to manipulate at times. Just not quite as sturdy as I thought it would be. I would not purchase another."
3,Think Again,"The Norpro Bread Slicer is convenient with its crumb catcher; however, I found the size of the slices to be much larger than I anticipated. They are much too thick for a standard size slice for sandwiches. I will likely be investing in a different slicing guide in the future."
2,flimsy plastic sides,"we make a lot of 2 lb loaves and like others had to buy a longer knife & then the point would miss the mark...AND; break the ""plastic fingers""/cut into the bottom, finally bought a small bar plastic cutting board to place in the bottom for the loaf to sit on just abit higher...finally gave up after 90% of the plastic fingers were broken & had our local woodworking shop make us two wooden slotted sides with 1/2"" spaces for cutting...PRESTO, now product is very useful!"
1,Junk- complete waste of money,It didn't survive unpacking. Broken on both the cheaply constructed wooden base and the little plastic fingers. Even if it had held together it is too small (across the long end) for most loaves made by bread machines and way too far across (the narrow end) for anything short of a saw toothed machete. Great idea but very poor execution.
3,OK - but could have been much better with minor changes,"Looks better than it works. It will help you slice your bread much better than freehand, but it could have been much better with some slight design changes.It needs to be narrower. It is way wider than any loaf from any typical loaf pan. This width requires the use of extremely short cutting strokes with any normal bread knife.One other improvement would have been a cutting surface with the slots running the other direction. If the slots were spaced the same as the knife slots, the pine cutting surface would NOT get all sliced up the way it does now."
3,Bread slicing guide,"Slices come out a little too thick, but I can adjust.It's quite acceptable, accommodates bread from the bread machine."
1,Needs inprovements,This product needs some engineering help. It is too wide for almost all breads and it is hard to find a knife over eight(8) inches in length. The bread slice slots should also be an 1/4 inch below it's present settings. It is hard to make sure you have cut through the slice. And what loaf of bread has only eight (8) slices ? Other wise it is a good product.
2,Norpro 370 bread slicer,"I was disappointed with the bread slicer. The base is too wide and my bread knife will not reach both grooves in the sides. This makes me have uneven slices of bread. This item has landed on my ""I shouldn't have bought this"" shelf."
2,Bread slicer too flimsy,Too flimsy to slice bread easily. It was much easier to slice by hand then to use the bread slicer.
5,Norpro Bread Slicer with Crumb Catcher,This is a really nice product that looks good but some bread knives are two short to reach across and still cut through.
3,Bread Slicer/Guide,This works fine for its intended use. I love the crumb catcher feature. Wish I had spent a little more and stepped up to a more durable unit.
3,"Could be better, could be worse","I got this to help me cut loaves from the bread machine. The slices come out slightly thinner now, but not necessarily even. The plastic is probably going to break soon and I haven't even used it that often. But it's less expensive than some of the other slicers."
1,SPIRITROY,THE BREAD CUTTING GUIDE BROKE THE FIRST TIME I USED IT.SENT A LETTER TO THE COMPANY AND RECEIVED REPLACEMENTS FOR THE PLASTIC GUIDES----THEY SHOULD BE MADE OF METAL
3,Norpro Bread Slicer,Great forcutting uniform slices of home baked bread. Could have been in a more dirable construction though.
3,Norpro Bread Slicer,"It works o.k. - It, however, isn't long enough for a whole loaf of bread, so you have to cut half and remove, then complete the other half. The wood is very soft on the bottom and probably will not last too long (we do, however, use an electric knife to cut our bread).Overall, the idea was pretty good. Most of the crumbs do stay in the cutting tray."
2,"Nice idea, poor implementation","The concept here is not bad, but the implementation will frustrate you. The spacing between the sides is too wide so a soft loaf of fresh bread still moves back and forth with the knife. The slots are quite wide, and a bit too widely spaced. There is no way to adjust any of this.The crumb catcher seems like a nice feature, but it's not really that important if one has no more than 2 or 3 loaves to slice. There is nothing to interlock the removable end wall into the side knife guide walls, so it pops out rather easily during slicing. The walls must be attached before first use, as they come laid down flat to save on shipping space, and it's reasonably easy to attach them.Unfortunately this item has fallen into complete disuse in our house--and not because we don't bake bread any longer."
2,"Next time, no wood","Next time, no wood. The bread knife slices right into the wooden base as well as the plastic. I don't know how much wood or plastic has ended up in the bread. If you get this slicer, you'll need a bread knife that is longer than 8 inches. That's the length of mine, and it keeps catching against the plastic slots, as it's not quite long enough, even though it looks as though it should be. There are also no instructions for assembly, for use, or for care."
3,"Works well, but base wood very soft and slices are thick","Bread slicer slices well, although slices are a little on the thick side; however, base is made out of a very soft wood (pine?), and after a couple of months, my knife has sawed half-way through the base. I subsequently bought the Bread Slicer Elite with a hardwood base, and, like most things in life, you get what you pay for. Also works best with a 12"" (blade length) serrated roast carving knife rather than a standard 10"" bread knife, since the width of the guides is 7"", and with a standard bread knife you have to make very short strokes. Knife also needs to be very sharp."
3,Could be better,The Plastic piece that is at the end to control the bread during slicing does not fit snugly enough so it more or less useless. this means you have to line everything up by eye.
1,Cheap crap,"The cheap plastic slots aren't strong enough. The knife used to cut the bread bound while cutting a slice of bread and snapped the plastic slot off, rendering the device useless. I had only used it for 2 days.Don't waste your $."
1,Should've listened.,After reading the reviews I decided to proceed with caution given the price.Glad I didn't lose much.This item is pretty useless.The acrylic tines are too weak to allow a knife to be drawn through and even if you manage it the slices still are not even.Wouldn't recommend to anyone.
2,"Crumb catcher is great, sides are flimsy. Overall, a semi- fail.","The base works fine as a nice cutting board that catches the crumbs. I had my husband take the sides off - it was really flimsy and difficult to hold the bread in place while slicing, thus missing the point of having slicing guides for uniform slices. The little plastic end plate kept falling out as well. My first instinct was to throw the whole thing in the trash, but then I realized I like the board, just not the slicing guides. SO I got a crumb catching cutting board out of it and more plastic in the landfill, lol."
2,Regina is right.,"I wish I had read Regina's review before I bought this. The sides are much too far apart so the knife slides out of the guide with every stroke. This is more than a little annoying. Like Regina said, don't waist your time."
1,Norpro 370 Bread Slicerand Guide with Crumb Catcher,"This is an OK bread slicer, but the end falls off when you press the bread up against it or when you empty out the crumbs. And it doesn't cut all the way through the bottom crust. Even if I make the smallest loaf in my bread maker it doesn't always fit and I have to cut the loaf in half which defeats the purpose of the cutter. Since you are always carving on the same end the wood is wearing out. Don't think I'd buy another one."
1,do they have a zero-star rating?,"What junk! Flimsy construction. When I got it, the wooden slats were all warped, which made the floor of this product totally non-flat. It took me less time to cut the bread by hand, which totally negates the purpose of this thing. Also, it's too wide, so you'll need an extra long bread knife. Mine didn't fit. Honestly, you're better off getting some cheap plastic junk from the dollar store, because it would probably be better quality than this excuse for a bread slicer."
1,In effective Bread Slicer,"The product looks good and is built well, but it is not long enough to accomadate the whole loaf of bread, you have to slice some of the loaf then remove those slices so you can finish the loaf. Besides the slicer not being long enough it is also not high enough which makes it harder to start slicing each slice of bread, one would think you could put the loaf in and the slicer would be higher than the loaf of bread allowing you to put the knife in the slicer to slice the bread. With this slicer you have to start slicing before you get to the slicer deviders, of course that makes for uneven slices.I would not purchase this product again, it is not worth the money they are asking for it due to the above reasons."
1,Unusable,"The spacing between the two sides is too wide to use any bread knife I've ever seen, much less owned."
1,Do not waste your money,I tried to use this slicer once and ended up throwing it away. It was cheap and did not work. It was not worth returning so it went in my trash can.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought two of these bread slicers, one for myself and one for my daughter. We both think they are totally useless. First of all, you'd need a knife over 10 inches long to span across the whole cutter and still stay inside the slots while you're doing the actual cutting. Second, the plastic of the guides sort of catches on the knife blade, preventing a smooth cut. Third, it bounces and slides all over the countertop while you're trying to use it. I gave up and just use a plain old bread knife on a cutting board and get much nicer results. Don't waste your money on this one. I only gave it one star because I couldn't give it zero."
2,Norpro Acrylic Bread Slicer,I found this slicer hard to use. Am not happy with it and cannot recomment it.
4,Good Item!,"Wish it had instruction, followed picture on box. Just was what I was looking for to cut the bread that I homemake....Excellent!"
3,Bread slicer,"it is a nice looking slicer. it does make you cut thicker slices than you want and the actual cutting area is short forcing you to stop and take the bread that is sliced out. it is also very wide to accommodate wide bread, but because of this it does not give much room to use the cutting action of a regular bread knife or electric knife."
2,back falls off,This product is a good idea but when i went to cut bread the back would fall out of the groves. maybe i will have to glue it.
2,Not really worth the money,"I was anxious to get this since I bake bread for my husband with Celiac Disease every week. What a disappointment! The basic concept of the slicer is good. However, the slicer is the same width as a standard bread knife. Which makes it almost impossible to actually slice the bread while keeping the knife in the slots. And, if you wiggle it, the end plastic piece falls off. Put a little more money into a better one."
3,Knew what I was getting into,"While this item was exactly what was discribed, its enability to change the slicing width makes for very large slices. So if you want just a little bread, don't have a sandwitch."
5,Great bread slicer,I make my own bread loves and it's always a chore to slice it right. This little gadget did the trick!
3,A Little Flimsy,"It's probably OK for soft breads, but it's a little flimsy for cutting ""serious"" hard-crusted multi-grain breads."
1,cheap product,a piece of wood and 3 pieces of plastic slapped on the side. The plastic doesn't fit well at all either. Seems fragile you'd have to be careful to not break it.
1,Useless Junk,"This product is so flimsy it would obviously break upon first use had it arrived intact, but it didn't. The wooden parts arrived broken - evidently they were supposed to be held together by some sort of glue, but either weren't or the wooden base was pretty well smashed while inserting it into the box. The plastic parts were obviously missing screws to hold them together. It can't work as intended because the design is so bad - the wood is just too flimsy.This product is so bad that I will never buy anything from Norco, and recommend everyone avoid their products. Amazon should be ashamed of itself for offering such junk."
1,looks good - but is useless,"Bascially this looks like it will do the job, but no it won't without great difficulty and very little precision. The end piece constantly falls out, the sides with slits are flimsy and the bread won't stay in place. Effectivley you need to somehow hold the end of the bread whilst holding the sides tight from the top which ensures the end won't fall out and even then if you manage to master this handspan(thank goodness for all those piano lessons) you are still going to get less than perfect slices. If anything I furious with myself for throwing away the packaging prior to testing, otherwise I would have sent it back. The bread slicer is now gone to the same place as the packaging.In short: If you have any relatives you'd like to torture or just drive completely bonkers this is the perfect gift. Otherwise do not waste your money, your sanity or your beautiful home-made bread on this item."
3,Doesn't hold up well,"Out of the box, the slats on ours were warped, but we didn't fret it too much since it isn't exactly an aesthetic masterpiece to begin with. But the real problem with this slicer is that the plastic tines don't hold up to daily use and the kind of pressure you are likely to apply trying to cut through a thick crust."
2,"REL, bread baker","The slices are appropriate for a thinly sliced bread. The crumb catcher is great, less clean up.Storage is a bother due to the size as it doesn't fold like other bread slicers. The acrylic part will not last that long due to slicing into it. I rate is as 2 stars."
1,A waste of money,A good idea that doesn't work. Read the other one star reviews. There is no reason for me to repeat all the problems that have been pointed out. I just don't understand why they don't have a zero star review.I'm going back to my cutting board and my electric knife.
2,wider bread difficult to slice,"I also purchased this item but with much less success than the bread keeper. This item was also purchased at Amazon. I tried to cut my loaves of bread only twice because my breads did not fit well -I had to squeeze the loaf in between the guides and this caused pieces to tear off . I am sure that it does work well but not for the size of the loaves my bread maker produces. I slice my loaf on a acrylic counter top ,with a decent bread knife(Henckels) and the bread slices much more easily."
2,Great idea poor performance,"Back plate is always coming out of its track. Once, when moving it, it fell out and we thought we lost it. The biggest problem is that it is virtually impossible to keep the cut on the loaf from developing a top to bottom angle, especially with a loaf with a hard crust. Possibly a third or fourth hand would keep the loaf pressed solidly to the back plate. Something to press the loaf to the backplate would be an improvement."
5,Great product!!,"I bought this product for my daughter for Christmas and she LOVES it! She used to consistently slice bread on an angle. Now, every slice is even! I would recommend highly!"
2,It breaks quickly and easily,"This does make even slices, but within a couple weeks of use, 1 tine broke off; 1 month later another broke off. We still use it, but only until the vital last tine goes (which surely will happen). In short, it is not well crafted -- weak plastic, the wood is uneven (and your bread knife cuts into the wood). Not an impressive product."
3,It's OK but.....,"I'm a little disappointed in it mainly because the end falls out when you press the bread against it. I tried a little glue on it but because the sides wobble, the glue just won't hold. It would be nice to be able to adjust the slices but I was aware of that before I bought it. Other than that I find it useful--the slices are still even and that's much better than I could do."
1,Save your money,"It's just not that useful. Many loaves of bread are taller than the guides and with a regular bread knife you just don't have enough ""operating room."" I totally agree with the other two reviewers."
2,Hard to use.,This item looks good and helps keep the cupboard clean. But look are not everything. It is hard to hold still while cutting loafs of bread. I slides across smooth surfaces way to easy. I will be making my own modifications to the bottem to keep this from happening.
3,COULD BE A BIT BETTER,Still have a little trouble slicing the bread. Doesn't slice all the way thru. Needs some gruves on the bottom so you can slice better.
2,Ok but not really washable,"This bread slicer is very basic and works to make even slices of bread. However, the base of the slicer is made of thin particle board which is not actually washable. The wooden pieces are glued together and if you leave them in the sink they may come apart. It also slides around a lot while you are slicing. Crumbs go in the crumb tray but many also come off of the sides as you slice."
4,Manual Bread Slicer Guide,"Unless you want to slice your newly baked bread by hand, guided by hand, this slicer is the next best thing to an expensive ($1.5K+) commercial slicer. It works well, but you have to make sure you are keeping the bread pushed up to the end as you make each successive slice. You also need a very LONG serrated bread cutting knife, or just a long serrated knife. I don't know if they make knives especially for cutting bread, but maybe someone should...?The crumb catcher seems a little long compared to the plastic cutting guide length. If you had a loaf exactly the length of the crumb catcher (the wood part), then you would have to remove some slices to finish the rest of the loaf. No problem with bread-maker loaves though. They aren't that long.The wood used is soft. I put knife marks in mine each time I used it, but it doesn't look bad after six or seven uses thus far."
3,Plastic breaks too easily,"It's made for very wide bread. When you saw the bread, the end of the knife keeps hitting the plastic. One broke off already. Would be better off buying a different one that's not so broad. Would not buy again."
1,So not worth it!,Save your money! This is the worst thing I have ever bought! The bread does not fit within the plastic guides and the knife keeps sliding out as well. I can do better free hand. Sorry I bought it!
2,Sword Required,"The slot alignment is fine, however a standard bread knife for slicing is much too short! You have to make each slice with dozens of 1"" knife slicing motions. That's at least 30-40 for each slice of lovely crusty French bread. For our needs, the bread slicer was worthless. That's not counting the arm muscle spasms that resulted from the effort."
1,End piece falls out,The end plate falls out constantly while trying to slice the bread. The distances between slots are too wide - the bread is too thick. I can do better by hand!!
1,Trash that's not worth your time,"I have to agree with other comments about the low-budget, no-talent quality of this, er, film. I am surprised that 5 people bothered to review it. Perhaps like me they were angry about wasting their time. Some of the zombie/vampire make-up is good, but overall it's a painfully lame production. Also I am puzzled by the fellow who commented on one actress's pink underwear. Was he watching a foreign edition or something? Her shirt was pink, but her bra and panties were white. Let's strive for accuracy in our reviews, people!"
1,Witless,"This movie is very confused, the makers aren't sure if they wanted a zombie film, or a vampire film.Young group goes to an 'abandoned house' (where have you heard that one before) that used to be used to make horror films. They're near a grave-yard.The dead come back to life in order to recover a pendant. The walking dead are zombie-like, except part way through the film when one of the teens is bitten, she's able to speak. And one, only one has fangs.This same woman is there for the 'sex' appeal, only she continually covers her nipples. And, when she's frightened by a zombie/vampire, runs downstairs having somehow found the time to find her bra and put it back on - so frightened is she!"
2,sugar cubes,"I love the brown sugar cubes but when I ordered this item listed I didn't notice that it was for the WHITE cubes. The photo shown on the order was the brown box - this would only have brown cubes! I didn't attempt to return it because I read that Amazon doesn't accept food items returned and of course, I would have to pay the return postage."
3,Well at least 3 1/2 stars,"Just started this book and about 1/3 of the way into it. Some stories don't even have much sex or just mention what happens, nothing explicit.Some are very good stories that have you holding on with one hand.I may change the review after I read more, so stay tuned. I would recommend buying......it's worth adding to anyone's collection."
1,"Sadly, my old timer is no more... new one? Not so good","This is a lousy timer. It is nothing like the original Norpro timers from the early 2000's, which is where MY timer came from. I bought an extra a year or so ago, just took it out of the package and it doesn't work. Back to the drawing board.I'll visit a kitchen store to see what they are like in person before I purchase."
3,Love it,"It's so cute. My friend's kid broke my first one and I replaced it. This one seems of better quality. The other one would come undone all the time, but it still worked. I just always had to put the top back on. It seems they've taken care of this problem now. It even came in a little holder during shipment so that the top didn't come off."
2,OUR CHICKEN'S TIME RAN OUT!,"We've had this timer for a couple years now, maybe a little longer. It's really cute. It does ring really loud. But lately it's taken to STOPPING before it should, i.e., it just STOPS! No ring! Nothing! We've known our food is done when we've smelled things burning! And it never WAS very good at timing things for less than 10 minutes...it often did the same thing, that is, just stop, without ringing. But it was SO CUTE! We kept it and dealt with it. But not anymore. Nope! I'm on-line today looking for a different style chicken timer!"
1,ugh,"This is a piece of crap. It stops at the 15 min. marker way too often, I end up just using my microwave timer instead.Delivery was excellent"
2,so cute yet so fragile,i am so bummed that my cute little chick friend cannot hack it.it broke. again. this is the second one i've ordered. i must look for a sturdier chicken.
4,Buck ba gock,"I love the way this little timer looks sitting in my kitchen! He does fall apart into 2 pieces easily....if he dings his way of of the little stove ledge this happens. But, no biggie, easily put back again. I like this little chickie :)"
4,Chicken Timer,"Cute timer. Ringer not very loud so don't expect to hear from another room. Winding up is a little weird, so make sure you read the directions. Overall, it works for me."
2,It works!,"This is a pretty simple timer. It's plastic, you turn it to the time and it rings when it's done. It feels cheaply constructed. Setting the time can take some fidgeting with the thing. In the end, it works though. If you like the novelty of the chicken timer, get it. If you want a real kitchen timer, get something else."
1,Piece of Junk,"This timer is adorable, but if you actually want it to keep time, you'll be disappointed. It randomly stops before time is up whether I set the timer for 5 minutes or 50 minutes. I'm returning mine because of this defect.It also falls apart really easily."
1,The chicken was a dud,"My timer didn't work either. It arrived broken in two pieces, and even though I was able to put it back together, it just didn't work. Back it went. It's cute, but pretty much useless."
2,It did not work!!!,"I received my timer yesterday and decided to test it... IT DIDN'T WORK!!! I shipped it back right away. It looked somewhat cute with the chicken and chicks but the quality is not really good, not just because it didn't work, but just how the plastic looks. I would get another kind in a heart beat..."
2,Broke and Melted,"I'm rough on products, I guess, because this broke and melted within weeks of the purchase. Poor chick."
2,They still haven't fixed it yet.,"I've been watching this item for a while to buy for my wife. I saw the reviews about it stopping and basically not working correctly and figured that this was a pretty serious fault and someone in a factory somewhere would be working on a solution to this.So it's been many months since the last review and I decided what the heck, I'll take the plunge and buy it and we'll see if they fixed it.Nope. It's still broken as detailed in the other reviews. At times, it simply will not go off. Your best warning is when you stop hearing the ticking.I still give it 2 stars though because the wife loves how cute it is. She doesn't even care that the thing fails to serve it's primary function. I guess if you are looking for a figurine rather than a timer, this could be a winner."
1,Norpro Chicken timer,"Don't buy it! Poor construction and build quality, broke the second time I used it. Plastic top is weak and mismatched, and the timing marks don't line up."
1,The timer doesnt work,"I bought a timer, but it doesnt work. It stops with minutes to go, and doesnt ring. A total waste of money."
1,"Cute, but quit working and did't get a response from Amazon",I contacted Amazon about this timer working and was surprised that I never heard from them. I wanted to exchange but wasn't sure that I could . It quit working just after the return date expired. I only used 2 times to time boiling eggs.
3,kitchen timer,"This is the only poorly made product I've ever purchased through Amazon. I had to take it apart to make it work the first time. It doesn't keep exact time, but works ok for a rough estimate while cooking. It is sort of cute and colorful sitting on the stove, but is not heavy duty in the least. I looked a long time at many places and all the new timers seem to be cheaply made like this one."
1,A lot of interference from other radio frequency devices.,"There is a lot of interference if you have any other wireless radio frequency devices like a baby monitor, cordless phone or an alarm system. We also have Sony's infrared wireless headphone version and that one works quite well, but of course you have to be in line of sight.I wouldn't buy the radio frequency one again, but I am ordering the infrared version for my mother.Hope this helps - Mark"
1,this product does not work,These wireless headphones simply does not work. All you get is static and noise. very disappointing. I am preparing to send it back.
1,I strongly recommend not to buy this product !!,"I bought this as a refurbished. It was quite good peice, but it has weak noise. I don't know whether it's because of refurbished one or its nature.Even weak noise makes me annoy. So, I gave up using this product."
2,ungently needed,"dear selleri will like to order this item i need it ungently send me the shipping cost and total amount thanks,yours regardschan"
2,not there yet...,"I wanted headphones to use with my guitar amp. and home theater system at home.I was reluctant to try wireless systems because I had negative experiences before, but then I thought hey, wireless headphones have been around long enough to achieve the level of sophistication. Well I was wrong. There is no way to totally eliminate the noise in these headphones, even so close to the transmitter. (I made several tests, making sure no object was interfering) .The slightest noise in headphones is enough to bother users, so wireless headphones is an area that requires absolute perfection. Bottom line,this set does not provide that. I'm wondering if bluetooth or higher frequencies have resolved the issue, but yet they're expensive. For now, I will extend my wired headphone cord.Another problem is placing the headphone on the charger, it requires some attention and skills..."
1,Absolutely horrible,These headphones should not even be on the market.They are horrible even sitting directly in front of the transmitter. I would disconntinue this item and if I was smart I would have returned them. Norm
2,bad recption,"i am getting more andm ore dissappointed with these. i have my transmiiter practically next to my head and i still get static, lots of it if i turn up the volume to the max. if i turn my head or lean back, the static pattern changes and this is very annoying."
3,good extras but less than great sound,The automatic shut off of power battery charger are great features.But the sound fades in and out and is rather flat.
1,Disappointed - Such Interference!,"What everyone else is saying is exactly right. I have these headphones less than three feet from the receiver and there is such bad static I can't even use them! I have messed with the tuning for days, but am just giving up. What a letdown."
4,Interesting Alternative,"This is a very strange interpretation of the New Testament. Weird might be a better description. The authors are attempting to remove all dated cultural coloration, while remaining true to the earliest texts. It is not dissimilar to the work of Origen in some ways. I enjoyed reading it despite the repitition of some of the lengthier attempts at translation. Even if you reject it on principle, you should read it to be able to understand the point of view when you run into it in other places."
1,Blasphemy,"I can't believe that this book or so-called 'Bible' is in existance. This is not the Word of God.KJV: ""Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, 'Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.' But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.""New: ""Meanwhile Rocky was still sitting in the courtyard. A woman came up to him and said: 'Haven't I seen you with Jesus, the hero from Galilee?"" Rocky shook his head and said: 'I don't know what the hell you're talking about!'"""
1,Hold your breath,By adding and subtracting to God's word I hope Mr. Henson is ready for a milstone to be hung around his neck for leading people astray. Then again he probably won't need to worry about it (he probably omitted that verse too)!
1,it is blasphemy!,"This is trying to turn the word of God into his or her favor.This will not help you understand the word of God, He never intended his Holy Love Letter to us to be turned into these misinformations."
5,"Oh man, these are cool.","I remember playing with these things when I was growing up, and the old ones were as poseable as a brick, and broke really easily. Hey, I loved them; they were cars that turned into robots and then fit together with OTHER cars that turned into robots. What's not to love? But the new versions... man, kids these days have it all.The new line of Energon constructicons are plenty durable and playable, and, like their predecessors, fit together with the other four in the series to make one big robot. Steamhammer is one of the coolest of the bunch, with a large shovel for a hand and several accessories.These are good toys for kids in general; they make you think sideways in order to figure out how to transform them, and each little puzzle forms part of a bigger puzzle (the larger gestalt robot). Like I said, I loved these growing up and hopefully my kids will, too."
3,101 Questions About Copyright Law,"101 Questions About Copyright Law is just that... 101 random questions pertaining to Copyright Law and their answers are included here. I found that this book will be helpful, but that I also needed something that would go further into detail than just a standard ""question-answer"" format. In my opinion, this is the type if book that will be most useful as a type of quick reference manual. As a beginner's book I find that it will be used best in addition to other books that I purchased containing more in-depth material."
2,Slapped together,"Even at this low price, the book isn't worth it. You get the questions and answers--but no organization, no grouping of questions into related topics or chapters, no list of question, no index--no way to search for just what you need to know. Have a specific question? You will have to browse through the entire book to find it. The book also does not give enough of a background to help writers make informed decisions. This was a book written by a lawyer, not a writer, and it shows.Save your money and buy Cheryl Besenjak's ""Copyright Plain and Simple"" instead."
3,"Decent read, but a poor reference","I enjoyed my first read through the book fairly well. It's clearly written, and gave a pretty good overall feel for the way that copyright law works. So it's still on my shelf, and I don't feel bad about the little bit it cost me.But...Exactly as the title suggests, the book is a series of questions and their answers. Although there is a sort of progression from question to question, there is no index, no table of contents, and no real grouping of questions into categories. So if I have a specific question, it would be very hard to find the answer in this book.Overall, I'd say it's a decent read, but a very poor reference."
3,It works,This was a stocking-stuffer gift for my daughter who loves to cook but fears cutting herself (with good reason) - she says it does the job...
4,Essential Bassics,This book is an excellent introduction to the double bass. Good coverage of the positions up to the octave. The only weakness is that there is no introduction to thumb position.
5,Super Chicken Roaster,We gave this vertical chicken roaster to our daughter-in-law as a gift. Our son said the chicken came out great and she said it was so easy to use and clean up afterwards. The chicken was very jucie.
5,Wonderful Product,I have used vertical roasters for years but needed a new one. I like to use mine in the oven. Saw this on America's Test Kitchen and decided to order it. I used my favorite herbs with 1/3 cup water in the infuser and basted the outside and seasoned it as I always do. It was perfectly roasted and exceptionally moist. I now have two so can have plenty of perfectly roasted chicken with company.
5,chicken can roaster,It's awesome and does the job great!!!! Easy to use and much sturdier than others I've had thru the years..We love it and so handy to use in the smoker also..
4,Norpro Vertical beats the old rotisserie,"I bought this for my lady to replace a worn out Sunbeam 20-year-old rotisserie,we found it does roast great tasting chickens, the only reason I went four stars instead of five was because we found the base should be larger to hold more grease.She had to experiment with ways to lift the chicken off the roaster with the base full of hot grease it was a dangerous challenge, finally she got the idea of using several paper towels in each hand as pads and lifted it right off easily."
1,Did I do something wrong? I'm so disappointed...,"I don't know if it was ""user error"" or not, but I was very disappointed when I used this what-I-felt-to-be beautifully designed piece of equipment. The roaster completely stuck inside the chicken; it and the chicken were very hot to the touch, of course, so I couldn't get hold of it to grapple with it very effectively; but I didn't want the whole thing to cool off totally, because I wanted nice hot chicken. I ended up ripping the whole thing apart and using the chicken for a nice batch of broth. I found the roaster very cumbersome to use, and, I'm sorry to say, I haven't used it since. If there was a trick to it that I didn't know, I'd be very glad to hear about it..."
2,The Best Could be Better,"The Pros: Holds a dedicated cup (the ""infuser"") to moisten and flavor the inside of the chicken, unit is easy to assemble and store. The Cons: the drain receptacle plate is too small (in diameter) to contain the liquids that drain from a chicken weighing more than 4-5 lbs. Also, absent handles, It is difficult when wearing oven gloves to move the unit from oven/grill to counter top without spilling hot liquid fat. There is no good place to hold it. A heavier, larger drain plate with handles is definitely needed. Finally, it does not feel stable enough. I worry about it tipping over b/c of the small base. I bought this unit b/c of the infuser feature - I was trying for ""Beer Can Chicken"" but frankly I would not buy it again. I do not think filling the infuser with beer made a significant difference in the flavor. It is a waste of good beer."
5,Must Have,I love to grill and this product has made cooking chicken on the grill a pleasure. I now know what Santa is bringing for my kids.
3,Not as tasty as when cooked on the Weber 6408 Style Poultry Roaster,"Chicken is not as tasty as when cooked on the Weber 6408 Style Poultry Roaster.I had the Weber 6408 Style Poultry Roaster first and really like it.Then I saw an episode on ""Cooks Illustrated"" tv show where they picked this Norpro.I trusted the review and everything made sense so I purchased one.Now thinking back, I believe that the Weber had a better taste and was more juicy.Also I do not think that the taller Norpro would fit under the lid of my bbq.Even the Weber is a close fit.I will give it another chance by making two beer can chicken at the same time in the oven.I will update with the results.Note that the Norpro went together without a problem and the chicken came off without a problem.Quality construction and I liked it, BUT, I believe the Weber 6408 Style Poultry Roaster is also a great design and produces a better tasting chicken."
2,This book was okay,"After reading Papa's wife, I wanted more of the family to read about. I ordered this book but was disapointed as much of it was already in Papa's Wife, which I loved. The books seem to be expensive for such a thin book.I wouldn't order it again if the reviews had been honest on here."
1,The return of the singer with no voice! Creepy!,This disc is woeful and the singing is incompetent and unpleasant.Warning - no serious music lover should buy this recording.I am sorry. I should have mentioned that this CD makes a very attractive beer mat or mini frisbee. You can forget about the slapper on the cover! It will be interesting to see if Flipper Giordano ever makes another CD! I don't doubt for a moment that the Flipper the dolphin made more attractive noises!
3,ok,"Towel is ok, nicely sized... Only concern is that logo is just a press on... The term embellished was used to describe the logo, I incorrectly assumed it was an embroidered logo. Im guessing it'll wash off or start to crack after a few trips through the washer... Not the sellers fault, just the manufacturer"
5,Garlic Keeper's a Keeper,"I didn't expect this thing to make too much of a difference from my old ridiculous method of storing bulbs in a stoneware mug, but wow! Garlic now lasts months and months. I am impressed. It holds a lot more garlic than I used to buy. Notice that I said, ""Used to buy?"" I have found myself brave enough to buy a lot of garlic now, knowing that it'll be there to use whenever I need it to be. The keeper's very pretty and I wish it came in other colors for gifts for people with varied kitchen color schemes."
3,"Interesting idea, but subpar quality","The first garlic keeper that came had the opening warped, so the top wouldn't rest properly. The replacement had the same problem, but to a lesser degree. The replacement had glazing problems on the inside of the keeper. The glazing did not make a complete seal. I do not know how much this will shorten the life of the keeper. All and all I stopped playing tag with Amazon and have one that is okay, but with enough defects to warrant three stars. Recommend buying one in the stores, so you can inspect it closely prior to purchase."
4,Convenient and attractive,This keeper makes sure your garlic is right at hand on the kitchen counter and keeps it from drying out or going stale.
2,I do NOT recommend for powerful chewers,"Bought this based on reviews for my toy destroying Boston Terrors. Unfortuntely this did not work for me, they chewed through the rubber within minutes of me tearing off the tag. I will be sticking with kongs and gohnuts."
4,Solid Atomic Rocker,"Chunky guitar, good singing, Sam Taylor production...sounds like I'm talking about King's X. After reading the reviews on this band, I decided to try them out being a big fan of King's X and the galactic cowboys. I'm glad I did. This is a fabulous debut from this Texas band. It's too bad the Texas sound didn't catch on like the Seatle sound. Taylor was a great producer. Anyone know where he is today?? I love the song december."
4,Good early King's X sound,"If you are wanting some more early King's X albums but have them all, then get this. Excellent production, heavy guitar, and fantastic melody."
4,"Pretty nice jacket, but some sizing issues","This is a nice jacket at a very nice price. The trouble I had with it is that I generally wear a medium and this jacket would have also fit me best as a medium. So, what's the issue then? The problem lies in the sleeve length. I had to get a large because the sleeves would have been too short at medium size. Now, it looks a tad over-sized at the chest and waist, but I rather have that than too-short sleeves. Also, I purchased the brown jacket, and it is a lighter shade of brown than what appears in the picture."
3,It is not worth more then 12.99,"I think that 12.99 is the actual price for this jacket. It is not worth more. I have returned it because I expected something similar to the picture, but it was not even close. Maybe it is just me!"
4,A users guide,"Clayton et al have produced a useful guide that goes beyond the material usually taught at UG level. It will be helpful to both practicing engineers and to those on Masters level courses looking for a greater depth of theory and examples of applications. The book is well-ordered, assuming little prior knowledge but goes close to the limits of current theory and practice. It has a range of worked examples which are helpful to both students and practioners as well as clear graphics to illustrate problems. A useful book to have on the shelf for those more difficult design cases or to extend your knowledge of the subject. It is now a little dated in terms of the latest materials and computer analysis techniques but still provides essential background theory for all."
2,"Amazon purchase, Dissatisfied, Immitation Product",Normaly this product is very good but I purchased some from Amazon and it was not the same product that you would purchase at your hair care provider. I believe it is an immitation product. I recommend this product if you purchase directly from your hair care provider but would not recommend purchasing this item from Amazon.
2,Is ok,"I don't like conditioner that much,... I DO LOVE PAUL MITCHELL!!!!!! IT ROCKS....but I did like this a little but I would recommend rockaholic detangler it's great I love it but its really hard to find anymore :(........but this product was ok....i have the thinnest hair ever but it tangles alot.....i would recommend this to thick hair might be better for a thick hair girl than me with thin hair....lol.....hope this helped"
1,Didn't detangle or condition,"I have long, fine, straight hair that is not particularly dry or damaged. It does, however, seem to get a bit snarled at the ends sometimes after shampooing and wrapping it up in a towel. I was hoping for a light-to-medium conditioner that made it easy to comb through my hair. Unfortunately, this so-called detangler didn't seem to make any difference at all. In fact, regular conditioners like Aussie Moist or Neutrogena left my hair easier to comb out than this stuff. I also didn't care much for the scent of it, which reminded me a bit of the old Flex conditioners from the 80s. I ended up not even using all of this product up, so I feel like it was a waste of money. I've liked other Paul Mitchell products in the past, but this was the worst I've ever tried."
1,Not the same as salon bought,"I have used the Paul Mitchell Detangler for years. It is the only product that keeps my long thick hair snag free. It has always worked so well. This is the first time I did not buy the product from a hair salon and I am extremely disappointed. The bottle I got from Amazon is not the same product. It smells horrible and it is a different color. The Detangler should be a yellow color. The one sent from Amazon is white. The bottle I received even looks different. It does not look like the bottle pictured on the Amazon page nor does it look like a bottle found at a salon. Yesterday I went out and bought another bottle from a salon and it is the same wonderful Detangler I have come to know and love. I wouldn't buy it from Amazon again. If you shop around at the mall, you can find it even cheaper. I went to three places and found it for $13 (all others were at $21)"
1,spoiled product,This product does detangle but has a rancid odor. I've used the product before and this is not the normal smell. Don't know how long the product was stored before it was sold.
1,Stainless Steel???,"Picture of this product is deceiving. Looks like a product of 2 parts. We were expecting a 100% stainless steel corn cutter. Not what we got!Disappointed,George"
4,I love it,"On the positive side 4 stars: many 70 foot rows of cobs later I love it and it has saved me a lot of time. Stainless easy to clean, cuts good (to the person complaining it does not work, I'd say practice makes better and operator error makes worse, also corn cobs are individuals too and that needs to be taken into account as one handles them. If one's intent in to make corn mash, it is sure to be true.a point knocked off because: one must watch out and keep finger clear of blades, and so this seems common sense to me, so has not been an issue. If there is one thing missing it is a pan for underneath to catch the corn, but one can improvise with a cookie sheet just as well"
1,Ouch!!!,"We bought several corn cutters and did a comparison test. This one was the worst. I was disappointed, because I'd chosen this one, while my wife chose Kuhn Rikon as the ""most likely to succeed."" She won, hands down. While the Norpro was faster, it was also a bit dangerous. I kept nicking my fingers, creating some rather colorful corn. I put mine in the back of the drawer and waited to use hers. We bought two more of the Kuhn Rikons, one for us and one for a friend."
1,Broke in the very first minute of use,"Utterly useless waste of my time and money.The very first shove bent the extraordinarily flimsy blade back. I bent it back into place, and tried again with identical results.I can't believe anyone could give this thing anything but a zero-star rating. Do those other people work for the company that makes it?I'm utterly baffled by how this piece of [...] could ever work, except perhaps on a stick of soft butter.Unbelievably poorly made."
4,The art of writing a fencing book,"This is a highly recommendable book with good explanation of the techniques of this magnifique sport. The pictures are a little ""oldisch"" but show good skills and there is just enough text on the pages to be able to read and to practice at the same time."
4,extended essays on jungian persona concept,"Chapters:Preface and Foreword, with brief summary of Jacobi's work.What is Psychology For?Man in his MaskPeople Without LoveMan Between Good and EvilJacobi explores Jung's concept of persona or mask, discusses repressed aspects of the psyche, and posits that there is no inherent conflict between psychology and Christianity. 94 pages."
1,Crashes While Cleaning,"I own the PC version of this software and I have been very satisfied with the quality of the PC version however, this MAC version repeatedly crashes while cleaning. Currently, (6-30-04) Webroot does not have an update that fixes this problem. I am sure that they will make a patch but as for right now I would not buy this product until the bugs are worked out. I would easily rate the PC version a 4 or 5 for quality and I am disappointed that the MAC version does not work."
1,"Right now, don't waste your money","I use this product for my pc and for my old imac running the classic mac os and I am well satisfied with the performance of this product for those apps. However, at this time, I can not recommend this product for the mac os x. After several contacts with their mac tech dept., I have reached the conclusion that they think I'm stupid, they don't give a damn, or they are clueless (or any combination of the previous). It will not consistently clean out Quicktime, Preview, or ""previous folders"" found under the Go menu in finder to name a few. Until they get a handle on working with os x, I would suggest to you not to buy."
2,"Good, Scratches Cast Iron, Different Shades","I bought two of these, but a couple months apart. That may have been the reason for the different shades of gray. Same design, just different shades. They look good in my white sink. They also don't sit right against the sink surface, so it allows food to flow beneath it. I have a cast iron sink. But the little feet are hard and have been scratching the sink. So if you have a cast iron sink, I don't recommend buying these. If you don't put heavy objects on the mats or scrub pots on them, then it should be just fine. I mainly bought these to help reduce chipping of my dishes or noise."
2,RUBBER maid should change it's name to PLASTIC maid.,"USED to be, Rubbermaid had FLEXABLE sink mats....had mine for years and years then decided to UPDATE. The new products are STIFF, never really stay put in the sink during dishwashing. Slip and slide and end up sideways. In their defense, they do protect the china (when the mat is in place) but don't even think about scouring pots and pans since you chase the pan all over the sink trying to polish it. VERY disappointing !"
3,A kids review,"I got this item for a party favor a long time ago.It was fun but it broke after a while.I like the 12"" G.I.Joes more."
5,Fun Reading But Serious Advice,"The best inspiration is proven success, and that's what the case studies in ""Do Something Different"" provide. The idea of cherry-picking marketing examples from small, medium and large enterprises shows that what works for the goose does so for the gander, without resorting to cliches such as that, i.e. you don't need to be a big guy to apply these methods. ""Do Something Different"" can be read cover to cover and then periodically picked up for inspiration. Pick a story--any story. As an individual who has recently become involved in a small publishing venture, I was pleased to see that we were already doing something different and that we now have examples to do even more of that. There are many more BHAGS to be bagged ;-)"
3,A basic look at marketing practice,"This book is a great start for people and businesses who have very little or no marketing experience at all. It covers the usual ""find something you are good at"" technique in differenciation.However this book contains no ground breaking new ideas or techniques at all. Not bad, but not particularly good either."
2,Looks can be deceiving,The bags appeared to be larger than they were in real life. This made all the bags of little value. Too bad as the bags from the same maker in the stores were larger.
5,Love it!!,This CD set will take you back to some great songs of the late 70's through the 90's. Amazed I did not realize how many great songs he sang!! Have fun!!
5,Indeed,"Not sure you can really capture the Very Best of Joe Jackson at all. He is an icon of so many styles of music. While he mainly sticks to a modern jazz style he put his punk/rockabilly shoes on for his first release Look Sharp! then we go to the other end od the scale with the jazz influenced Body & Soul and somewhat on Night & Day. One of hs greatest overlooked records wa the soundtrack to the movie Mike's Murder. the song...Memphis....is represented in this collection and is a classic Joe Jackson jam. I love this guy Always have no matter what shoes he is wearing. This is a great collection of all of the highlights from his career. The hits and the one or two misses that should have been hits. The CD should be titled, ""Let Me Entertain You""."
5,steppin out,"Love the album, it's almost always in my cd player. If you're a fan I would highly recommend."
4,Amazing!,"Joe Jackson is really underrated artist. Very mid-english timeless feeling (pubs, clubs, broken hearts, endless struggle for better life, football hooligans and finally - everything around us full of beauty).The songs touched by a lot of eclecticism and sometimes remind you The Police, Todd Rundgren's Utopia, Billy Joel and Elvis Costello.Musthave item for all music fans."
5,Great Dog Reference,"Even in the world of the Internet, it is valuable to have a book to refer to for all breeds. I found the information very good."
4,Book was in very good shape just as described,Item was received and in good shape just as indicated in the seller's list. Very satisified with the condition and the time it was received.
5,Bean Pot Plus,"Baked beans, without the worry of burnt beans. I have the red one. I use it as a general casserole dish, as well.I am quite pleased with this product"
3,Difficult to place,Umbrella is very lightweight but still seems sturdy somehow. Mechanisms look adequate. Unique shape makes it difficult to place on the patio. It reminds me of a hang-glider or the Flying Nun. Hope it doesn't take off in a breeze. I'm not disappointed with the product itself but I'm not happy I selected it. I suggest you are very clear on your application for this unit. It did not interchange with standard umbrellas for me.
1,Do not buy the Coolaroo Volare contemporary market umbrella,"This article was terrible. I had to throw it away after the first use. The metal rods bent, the material was substandard. Unfortunately I had thrown away the box and the receipt as I did not forsee a problem and have not returned things before. What a waste of over $150. I will buy locally in future."
5,An anthology of writings by Native American women,"Composed and compiled by author, activist and former principal chief of the Cherokee Nation Wilma Mankiller, Every Day Is A Good Day is an anthology of writings by Native American women reflecting on such varied topics as day-to-day life, love and acceptance, governmental issues, ceremony, finding one's way through difficult times, and much more. Black-and-white photographs of the contributors are included, but the primary focus of Every Day Is A Good Day is the power of the multitude of voices, most of which are from different tribes, and each one's message to all readers. A welcome amalgamation of wisdom, warnings, and dry commentary."
3,"Book is very detailed, didn't like the format of the exams","22 chapters of easy reading and understanding, but didn't like the practice and final exam questions."
3,Playful language,"Kadare relates the events of WWII as they impacted his hometown in Albania. The primary observer is a young boy, but Kadare does not let this become a narrative straight jacket. At the same time, the language tends to be playful, whether it is the boy or the author speaking (see example below), which is a rather unique way of dealing with terrible times. The city and its buildings are personalized, making them the most important character. This is a novel of society and events, not of deeply drawn characters.""Bushes had sprouted everywhere. Taking advantage of the neglect caused by the spring bombing, they had launched a furious attack on the house.....the wind was far from vicious that day, and was only attacking the sheets (on the line) in a playful way""."
4,Protective Goggles,"I do a lot of wood working. Table saw, Lathe and other tools. I like it better than my full face shield. I have had no problem with it fogging up. It is comfortable to wear. If my project is very dusty, I also use a dust mask with no problem."
5,Parents and kids want to have fun,music for kids and parents - a rarity! catchy lyrics to songs us parents know and kids like to sing along too!
4,Good source!!,"This set has been very useful in gaining new insights on the text of the New Testament. The biggest & only complaint i have regarding this is that it doesn't cover the entire New Testament. I would still recommend it, though."
1,not worth the low price,"Very attractive serving dishes. However, the round handles on the lids (I bought two) broke off--one during shipping and one in the dishwasher. Not durable enough for regular family use."
1,a fellow fan from punaniville against silverman,word...right on friend....this stuff is wak...waker than wak...i rahter b deaf than hear this stuff...
4,Summer breeze,"If you are of a certain age that you remember hotel orchestras playing for dinner, this music will remind you of that time or of movies you have seen from then. You can listen to these summer sounds that do not have too much symphonic sound, but are not just the mood music found in elevators.They are a bit familiar, but not too heavy or intrusive.This would be good to have as background for dinners and just to have a nice sound and mood of a summer breeze."
2,Am I the only one on the planet who hates Baby Einstein?,"I find the computerized production of the great music represented in all the Baby Einstein CDs really, REALLY annoying. Why not just put a collection of the REAL orchestrations together? Every time I hear these productions, I wince at the cheesiness of the instrumentation. I really think kids would be better served listening to symphonic recordings of these classics. The richer texture of the orchestra and/or chamber orchestra (or even a REAL piano solo) would seem much more stimulating to developing brains than this ""classical lite"" approach."
3,cute CD's but they won't download to computer or other electronics,"I like Baby Einstein and thought that this was a cute CD. However, we were not able to load it onto a computer, meaning we could not put on Ipod or Ipad which was the whole intention in buying this. I guess it apparently only plays in a CD player, so now I have to go buy a CD player for a five dollar CD I bought on sale. I'm not real happy about that.I also, love that this is Mozart, but didn't realize all music would be played by a synthesizer, therefore, not actually sounding like the real music. If you can get this on sale great, otherwise I would probably say pass."
5,Lively and comforting CD!,This CD is inspiring and comforting! I have listened to it a lot since I got it and will continue to share it with junior when he arrives.
1,What's with the instruments???,"The computerized instruments sound so cheezy and tinny. Why in the world doesn't Disney produce this thing properly so that infants (who pick up on every little thing) can learn the proper sound of the music? The musical selections are so great -- the baby friendly classics, of course -- but they just ruin it with the orchestration! Also not sure what this has to do with your child becoming a Baby Mozart. It doesn't purport to teach anything -- it is a basic music CD that contains, well, music. There is another product, Trebellina, that has some of the same classical music, and other genres as well, and teaches babies the notes, instrument names and sounds and other useful tidbits."
4,Good Book,"It took some time to get into this book. It is pretty complicated. I think I was looking for answers when I wasn't even sure what the question was when I first picked it up and so the book seemed very abstract. But after about 6 or 7 times referencing the book trying to solve various problems I finally started to see what it was getting at. Since then I have found it particularly helpful. I really covers a lot. You definitely will start to listen to the radio, CDs. etc with all of the ideas/techiniques in mind. Not an easy read, but well worth it if you are willing to put in the required effort."
1,Sadly it's useless,"I write songs and was hoping to learn melody techniques. However, I don't play an instrument beyond plunking out notes on a MIDI keyboard. This book is full of what looks to be excellent melody techniques. I say ""looks"" because the examples are all given as sheet music. If you can't play an instrument [probably a piano] to a high standard you're not going to be able demonstrate them to yourself. The obvious solution would have been to have had a CD in the book, containing the played examples or have them downloadable from the Berklee site. I contacted the author, Jack Perricone, Chair of Songwriting at Berklee to ask him if he could supply me with performed techniques. He replied ""Unfortunately, no. I am in the process of writing a book that will have a lot of audio, but I don't have it for the Melody in Songwriting book."" I suggest you wait for that book. I regret to say that in my opinion I think this book in it's present form does Berklee Press a disservice."
4,Good book,"I have not read the whole book. But the parts I've read(1st 4 chapters), have already enlightened me on melody writing tremendously. The best thing I've gotten out this book so far, is how you can interpret the melody of a set of lyrics simply by trial and error. I never realized how much the phonics behind lyrics can drive the melody you develop using these lyrics. Really kool stuff. Although, I must say, you better be able to read before you buy this book. You don't have to be super good at sight reading, although that would help tremendously. But you should definitely be able to read treble cleff and rhythm. He teaches alot based off of this."
1,Norpro: A Poor Choice,"This is the most worthless piece of product I've ever bought. The mechanism to attach to a table is too small to use on a counter--I finally found an old wooden table that it would attach to--using a pair of pliers, that is, to turn it tightly enough to hold. Then, I used it twice---it will take only one bean at a time and then on cutting a plump bean, the Norpro just quit cutting. The handle refused to turn the inner blade. I DO NOT recommend this product.The positive? Amazon stood behind the product and within just a few days, it had been returned and credited to my account. Thanks Amazon--No thanks Norpro!"
3,Bean cutter,The cutter is OK. If you do not have a surface to attach it to you will not be able to use it. Luckily I have cutting boards that are part of my kitchen counter tops so I am able to attach this to the board when it is pulled out from under the counter. It works well but can only cut one or two beans at a time so it can get time consuming when you have many beans to cut as I normally do.
2,I agree with most of the others.,I agree with the rest...it doesn't clamp onto any kitchen surface we have and it definitely works better with two people operating. We were more disappointed with the size. The picture made it appear to be more like a meat grinder that would handle more than 3 or 4 beans at a time. When you grow your own garden and have 30 pounds at a time to try to put up...it's very cumbersome.
2,Tough to Use,"This product does french cut beans but what a pain to use. As other said it is almost impossible to attach, it only cuts 1 - 3 beans at a time, and the beans get caught inside the plastic blade holders. I really can't recommend this but I haven't found anything else that works better."
2,No better than the other cheapo slicers marketed,"This is the same cast ALUMINIUM piece of junk the other sellers offer for sale, even though the description says ""heavy duty cast construction with stainless steel blades"".I paid a few bucks more for this one from these folks thinking I was getting better quality based upon their representation.Sure the blades are nice, but what good is that in a puny housing?I wont be buying from these people again based on the quality of this product, and how it was advertised."
1,Norpro French Bean Slicer,"I was very disappointed with the product. It just plain did not work. I couldn't return it to Amazon because it had come from another company. I had bought two of the items, and returned them both.Unfortunately, they didn't both come from the same company. The company I mailed them back to called and said they would mail the other one back so I could return it to the right company, but that has been months, and I still don't have it.So, you might say I was unhappy to say the least.Patricia Baker"
3,Useful but a little awkward,"I like this tool but my kitchen counters are too deep to clamp it onto the counter itself. Had to clamp it on a cutting board which makes it less sturdy if you're doing multiple beans. I'm left-handed and like most things like this they're made for righties. Cuts can be a bit inconsistant...frankly, I prefer the other single bean frencher for many applications but if you were doing a quantity this would be the way to go."
2,Used this Bean Slicer for 2 Years,"We have used this for 2 years. The pluses...only one. This is about the only thing out there that french cuts green beans 3-4 at a time. The minuses are numerous. It can't be attached to just any edge and cannot attach to our wooden table or granite counters, which makes it very difficult to use. My husband and I often work it together so there are 4 hands to hold it down, shove beans in, and grind all at the same time. Beans do get caught up inside and need to be re-positioned. Hard to clean. But still we use it because it is easier than slicing one bean at a time with a knife."
5,Armik the Great at it again !,"Wonderful, beautiful mix of hot + spicy, warm + sensuous guitarra music for the ears. After a long tiring day at work, the most down-to-earth way to revitalise the battered body and soul. Armik's skillful and immaculate guitar licks is among the best there is in this crowded world of flamenco-jazz-latin-middle eastern brew.I did not buy Armik's music in chronological order of releases - this CD is among the initial two CDs i bought (the other being ""Gypsy Soul"", another brilliant composition). To-date, I've collected the ENTIRE six CDs from Armik the Great. Armik's music is special, so is ""Rosas Del Amor"". All six albums have their own unique character and theme. This album is highly recommended. If you are new to Armik, I urge you to sample it now. You will come to the same conclusion as I have - simply irresistible. Well done! Armik.Can we expect more the your 'ear-food' in 2002, Dear Armik ?"
4,Recycling Melodies,"As much as I love Armik and his magnificent guitar techniques, but unfortunately, he has been recycling his melodies lately. Many of the pieces on this CD are either the exact copies of his previous works or have been modified slightly. That is a shame for such a super artist. He needs to take a break from producing a new CD every year, and create new masterpieces.A big Armik fan,Farhad"
1,DON OMAR,"IF I HAVE THE OTHER CD'S, WHY SHOULD I BUY THIS RIPOFF?REGUETON IS REGUETONIVY QUEEN AND DON OMAR ALWAYS COME OUT WITH SUPPOSEDELY NEW CD'S THAT ARE ONLY THE SAME ONES FROM 3 YEARS AGO.I HEARD IT SO MUCHHOPE IT GOES AWAY FOR A WHILETOO MANY REGUETONEROS POPPING UP FROM EVERY CORNER.ENOUGH."
3,Some Good Tracks,"I was blown away by the video ""Reggaeton Latino,"" and had to check out the CD. Overall, it's pretty good. There are about three or four tracks that are good enough to make regular rotation in my music collection.That being said, there's a LOT of filler on this album, and only the hardcore can withstand an entire hour of Reggaeton beats that start to sound like the same song over and over.The best tracks are 1 ""Reggaeton Latino,"" an anthem-type song that's ugly good. Track 6 ""Scandalous"" by Cuban Link has the infectious hook that makes it hard to keep the volume turned down. Track 5 ""Dale Don Dale"" featuring Fabolous has a strong, hitting beat that has to be heard (and felt). There are a few other good tracks in here, then the rest kind of sounds like generic Raggaeton filler that would work as background to a dance but not for listening."
3,A little bulky,This product worked all right but it was a little bit bulky and difficult to navigate with. I will be looking for something else before we travel again. Sorry.
4,Airport and ID/Ticket Wallet,"Good product. The only thing inconvenient is having to open it repeatedly. An open slide type pouch might be easier when having to repeatedly reach for passport/ID, etc."
4,Handy,"I'm currently using it and it seems to work quite well. A bit bulky after a while when you put it under a hooded sweatshirt, but it is non-noticeable for jackets. It gets bulky and trying to put it in a pocket isn't best if you add too much. I'd recommend storing only 1 passport, 1 drivers license & 1 other ID (student ID, work ID, etc), 3-5 cards (credit, debit, etc.), and a quarter inch of compressed cash/paper."
2,Too much $$ for too little product,"When this arrived I was surprised to discover that the tiny bottle of powder was simply run-of-the-mill baby powder (complete with the familiar scent). The brush is nothing special and is too large to fit down into the powder bottle without mucking up the bristles.The only item in this trio that constitutes a 'maintenance' product for your trimmer or shaver is the oil. Save yourself $7 and skip the ""Maintenance Kit"" in favor of buying theShaver lubricating Oil 1/4 ounce vile for electric shavers and hair trimmerson its own from the same seller. If you're buying the shaver, it might come with the powder anyway; mine did."
2,More Exercise and Less Talk,"This DVD would be great if only they did more actual exercising and less explaining of why exercise is helpful for arthritis. I bought this DVD to use for an exercise group I facilitate at work, but there is so much time devoted to explanations that most of the group participants were asleep before long, and couldn't benefit much from the limited physical activities it included. These people are already sedentary, they do not need to listen to lengthy explanations, but to keep moving in order to stimulate their immunity and boost their metabolism. This DVD misses that mark by miles!"
5,other review missed the point,"This book symbolizes the entire concept of caring for the poor, of caring for other people. ""You cannot feed all the cats in the world.."" ""you cannot save all the ships at sea.."" but we can all care for those in need who are in our own little section of the world.My absolute favorite book of all time. Barb"
1,THROW IT OUT!,"Horrible album! Even hard-core fans will hate it! I think someone found a bunch of old tapes that had been rejected and tried to make a quick buck. On most of the tracks it's difficult to determine if it's actually Ms. Summer singing. Trust me, don't waste your money."
1,Shout It Out,"Very disappointing. Were her name and picture not on the case I would have never guessed Donna is even on this release. Sorry I purchased it. It's misleading that it appears to be a new release. Releasing ""I'm A Rainbow"" was one thing...this is something else all together."
1,Bought Used CD For $2...$2 TOO MUCH!,"I agree with all of the reviewers. Beware that there are other albums titled such as ""Fun Street"", ""Do What Mother Do"",... that contain the same thing. The only thing I want to add is a brief history of CDs like these. You can find it under donna-tribute.com in the discography section in the ""Collector's Notes"".I bought this used for $2 which is $2 TOO MUCH! Don't waste your time or your hard-earned money with this ""so-called CD""."
4,Questionable Research,"I just finished Freethinkers : A History of American Secularism and enjoyed it immensely. However, on page 88 she locates Seneca Falls, NY at the ""northern tip of Lake Seneca.."" Geneva is at the northern tip of Seneca Lake, Seneca Falls is 10 miles to the east, about a mile from the northern tip of Cayuga Lake. It is a small point, but the research on this is sloppy and it makes one wonder about the rest of the research."
2,Not what I wanted,"Not well written. Too many omissions and too much bias. I wanted the facts and the stories, not something intended to incense me or make a political point. I give her credit for writing a book about secularists and their influence on America, but at the same time this book is not the well written history that I wanted."
2,History or Editorial?,"This book starts out as a history of American secularism, and becomes an editorial diatribe. Secular thought is primarily described in terms of how it contrasted with ecclesiastical teachings, but there is not much focus on secular thought itself. She clearly favors the secularists, and in the last chapter goes on a rant about the evils of religion in today's society."
3,Possible explanation,Generally review copies are passed out before publication date. This book sounds interesting.
2,Don't waste your time..,This book was incredably boring. Reading it felt like a miserable task. I almost feel like the author wrote in such a way to make themselves sound smarter. To be fair I only read half of it. It felt like such a chore to read I would have actually prefered to read transcripts from C-Span instead.
3,Stimulating,"Very informative historical perspective on religion in America. It blew away some myths for me, myths I'd been taught in school about the role of religion in my nation's history. There are other books perhaps a little better on this subject, like Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins, but this will make you doubt your Biblical beliefs and whatever religious dogma you grew up with."
3,Interesting but poorly written,"The contents of history regarding secularism in American are mixed together with asides and editorial comments making a hard to follow book. The subject matter made me read the entire book, the facts that were offered made me glad I did, but this is one book you find yourself putting down every few pages because the author's schizoid approach to writing. One sentence will be history, next an editorial comment, and the next a personal interest item that doesn't enhance either the history or the editorial side of the book. Funny after reading this book I want a secular version of secularist history, because her own believes are so intertwined with the facts it lessens the importance of the history that is told."
2,Freethinkers: A Polemic Ripped From Its Context,"The book tells us more about Jacoby's 21st century world-view than the role of skepticism and secularism in America's history. This is a polemic disguised as history. There is no context to the book, as it makes no attempt to contrast secularism with the impressive contributions of religious figures and institutions to American life. I would love to read a review by a scholar of American Religious history. I don't see how any scholar of religious history - other than another fellow secularist - could make much of a defense of this book."
5,Dick&Jane,"This is the best book I've read since Dick and Jane. Slowly, arduously, independently, I have crawled through world philosophies in my 52 years finally landing on a moral view, for which I did not know there was such a rich historical tradition. I am a freethinker, and it's time for all freethinking American patriots to RISE UP! against the neoconservatives of our day. Jacoby's book gives me the courage and perspective to prevail."
5,I am astonished,How could I have missed the historical importance of Freethinkers? This topic was not part of any history course at any of the schools I attended. Thank you Ms. Jacoby and I hope your book leads others to question the value of our educational system.
5,Excellent read,"This book was excellent in its presentation of the secularist outlook of many American freethinkers. It exposed the nonsense that is presented by many ""fundamentalists"" and other gullible species and emphasized how many people are led astray by alleged ""moral"" teaching.I would recommend the book to all sensible readers."
1,Do not purchase!! Does not deserve even one star!!,"I purchased this video as a comparison to the video about about Mexico. It is AWFUL. It is basically a string of home video clips with boring, overly general statements dubbed on top. I have my own home video clips of the splendors of Spain and could create a more interesting/educational dialog in less than 30 hours of editing. Don't be as gullible as I was--this is a waste of money!!!!"
5,A Great Scientific Explaination for The Skeptical,This book will make even the worst skeptic take a good hard look at their reservations. It is a must read for any one who is involved with animals in any way. You will finish it with a new way of thinking about many concepts and ideas. Thank you Amelia for your exceptional explainations and the instruction you offer for us to use.
3,Coulda Been Better,"THis was the book for my Terminology For Health Professionals course. I'm a medical transcriptionist in training going toward a career in ultrasound. I'm also a word freak. I found this book acceptable, nothing more. If you're not fussy, there's good basic info there. But there are many misprints and spelling errors, and consistently the authors fail to use proper translations of Latin tenses, so a Latin word ending in ""ing"" (in Latin) will be rendered, in English, as ""a condition,"" for example. I got a lot of questions wrong because of this inattention to grammar. More important, their CD-ROM has about 20 errors that I found- - - you type in the right answer and it marks you wrong! Buyer beware."
1,Never received the book,I did order the book but I never received it. I am still waiting for my card to get credited!
4,"Excellent, clear reference with tools to study by.","This text is a useful and clearly-written terminology book for medical professionals' introduction to the terminology used by physicians every day. Additionally, this would be an excellent, if detailed, reference for the layperson."
1,Not what I ordered,"I have emailed the seller twice and have received no response. The description said paperback book and tapes. I didn't really want the tapes, just the book. I received tapes and no book."
3,"Tastes Great, Steeps not so Great","This is my favorite tea (in bagged tea) and I wanted to try it out loose since that makes better tea. I just finished up a tin of Fortnum and Mason's English Breakfast loose tea and thought Twining's Irish Breakfast would be just as good, hopefully better.Well, it tastes better than F&M;'s and the bagged version (yay!), but the tea is not really loose leaf--the leaves are coarsely chopped--so tea dust penetrates the metal strainer system I use--a system that has worked very well for the every other loose leaf tea variety I've ever tried. I suppose I can brew it with a paper straining method, but the cut up look to the tea makes it look like someone just cut open a hundred tea bags and dumped them into my tin...disappointing...tasty, but could it be better?"
1,Product details are incorrect.,"The description said that this product had a 5/8"" tube. Wrong! Maybe 1/8"". Peppercorns can barely get through the tube."
4,Not Funk Da Fried,"I'm a big Simply Jeff fan, and I have to admit I am a little disappointed with this album--and still I gave it 4 stars! It's not as good as Funk Da Fried V.2, but still a good album. This album will have you dancing, moving, rolling..."
3,looks better then it is,nice polished finish but pulley is fragilebut you get what you pay for so i guess its ok thanks
2,Not for beginners but good reference ...,"This book is not for those just starting out in assembly language programming. This was basically my first time programming in assembly and this book was not a big help. It only skimmed the surface giving a general description of all the components of the 68HC12 microcontroller with no concrete examples to help visualize what was going on.The chapters on interrutps, timers, parallel IO, and serial IO were not very clear and could use some more clear and simple examples to follow.This book would make an excellent reference for someone who knows what they are doing already as the descriptions of the different components are quick and concise."
4,Something's missing,These 2 LPs on one cd is quite a bargain really. The pop songs are poppy the blues are bluesy. A little filler here and there. Standouts; Bring It To Jerome and With God On Our Side. BUT!? Where is the Chapter Three record? Is it available on cd?
1,They Sent a Cheap Substitute,"Caution dealing with this store. Instead of a high quality Carlon junction box with four mouting points and a foamed in place gasket, what I got was a cheap Cantex box with a separate flismy gasket and only two mounting points. Could have bought it at a local Home Depot or Lowes for a much lower price."
2,Not like the movie,"I bought this for my toddler, thinking the songs would sound like they do in the Toy Story 2 Movie. They don't at all. Most of the music is slower than in the movie and it was just a complete waste of money. My son (age 2)doesn't like it, my daughter doesn't like it (age 13) and I don't like it. Wish I could return it."
5,A Solid Book,"In a world of quick fixes we hardly find any advice that truthfully tells us how to obtain success in a realistic yet spiritual way. In A Solid Foundation, Dr. LeRoy Bailey Jr. tells it like no one else can, exactly how to gain success in life--one building block at a time. God has allowed Dr. Bailey to build the most successful and largest church in all of the six New England states. Located in Connecticut, The First Cathedral is not just another mega-church but rather an oasis of love and a place where tattered and torn lives can be remade. This book will teach you how to go from rags to spritual riches, from poverty to wealth, from sickness to health, from laughter to joy, all by building your own Solid Foundation. This book needs to be called, The Commonsense Manual For Building Your Life. Great Work!!!"
3,"A little bit of everything- sex, violence, good story line","I remained entetained throughout the entire movie. The characters were well developed. It was one of those movies that you want to keep going. Unfortunately, they cut this one entirely too short. The end comes at what seems to be the climax. I hope there is a sequel that ends the story more completely :-)."
2,2 stars for the odd humor. 0 stars for plot.,"Two stars for the odd humor contained in this movie, and zero stars for the plot that tries to be overly impressive, but ends up being confusing and not that interesting to me at all...everybody has something they dislike...this one right here. =("
5,Action Packed,"I liked the book a lot. I've only read four of the series, but I'm hooked on them anyway. If you like action packed novels that leave you wanting to find out what will happen next, then read this book. It will make you mad, glad, and leave you satisfied. A great book."
4,warpped,"After a diappointing turn with their last (Rapture), this was a welcome relief. These nihilistic Finns are back and rocking. Suprisingly Alexi from Children of Bodam has added a new dimension to Impales already bombastic grooves. More akin to Suomi Perkele than Latex Cult. A very enjoyable waste of half hour. Fave track ""Zero Tolerance"""
5,box chain,"I really like this chain. It is very comfortable, doesn't tangle easily, has a secure clasp and looks great. It would make a great gift. I will be ordering more at various lengths as the chain will compliment several necklaces I already have. Amy"
5,Beautiful Chain!,I bought this to go with a sterling cross for my girlfriend. It is exactly what I wanted and at a great price! The clasp is sturdy and the chain itself is of good quality. I would certainly purchase again.
5,silver chain,Arrived on time. Got this chain for my 9 year old son to wear with his silver cross pendant. The chain is a very nice size for him.
2,Deceptive Photo and Description,"I ordered this chain specifically because the photo and the description (spring ring clasp) indicated that the chain has a lobster claw style clasp. It does not. Instead, it has a cheap, easily broken round clasp.I will keep the chain but I am very disappointed."
2,"1MM Italian Box Link Chain 16""","it seems like it's not the right size, and it's very delicate..i hope it doesn't break when my sister in law uses it, if it does, i will be letting you know."
2,Not what I thought,"This chain is pretty, but it wasn't as thick or as long as pictured. I have to purchase another one, but from somewhere else."
5,New Sterling Silver Box Link Chain Necklace 1 MM,"Just purchased eight of the necklaces for silver & glass pendants I created in a jewelry class. Three chains are 1MM for the lighter pendants, five are 1.5MM. I mistakenly purchased 16"" chains first, then returned them for 18"". The necklaces are very high quality as noted in the other reviews. Even the finer chains feel strong and solid. I am very pleased with the purchase and the return for longer chains was easy and prompt. I will definitely buy from these people again. They're gems!"
4,Don't like the clasp,I would prefer a lobster claw clasp on this chain. The chain is very nice! I like the 20 inch length that I purchased.
1,disappointed,"The main problem with this chain - it is too short and too thin. Not complaining because this is my fault: the length and width was clearly stated by the seller, so I should've known better reading all those positive reviews. But in reality this chain is not suitable for any sizable pendant or necklace. If you are a big guy with big neck it would choke you. And you can lose your pendant at any time since the link is not strong at all, it can break any moment. I guess there is no substitute to visiting a professional jeweler and paying in the neighborhood of 150 bucks for a good sturdy sterling silver chain."
3,"18"" silver necklace","I like the chain, except the 18"" was more like a 16"", you may want to buy a longer chain if you don't want the necklace close to your throat. The necklace is very thin and dainty it is probably best not to hang a heavy pendant on it. The necklace is not made for everyday wear and I'm worried it is going to break it so thin. I like the chain and will keep it for church or other special events."
5,Nice Necklace,"I love this delicate chain. It was perfect for my great niece. She was proud to get it.I gave it to her for Christmas. The shipping was right on time. I appreciate that.Thanks,Linda"
5,Beautiful,"This is a beautiful chain, especially for the cost. It is perfect for my birthstone charms. Very satisfied with this purchase!"
5,christmas,"my brother got this to go with a chain for his girlfriends christmas, came quick and looks just like its supposed to. very small and cute."
5,quality work,"This was a gift to my wife, she is the critic, and she really liked the chain.I will probably go ahead and order another one."
3,22 inch chain,Some of the Necklesses I ordered for my wife came with no chains. I ordered two 22 1mm inch chains. I didn't realize how small and delicate 1mm is. My bad..........I should have ordered a 3 of 4 mm. I'll know better next time. The chains that do come with certain items are too small and flimsey. They are very delicate and break easily
5,Quality at its best,"My daughter just loves this necklace I got her. Strong and durable. To bad I'm not a better sizer, almost to tight for her neck."
5,WOW!!!!!,"I recently bought an 18"" for myself... When I got it home, it was beautiful... Nice and sturdy, not thin at all. A very nice chain! I recommend this to everyone!"
4,Great for work,I bought this chain to wear with my work outfits because of its simple and elegant design. The necklace was also available in a longer length which I prefer. It works beautifully and I am pleased with my purchase.
5,Beautiful and Affordable from Gem Avenue,"As expected the silver chain arrived right on time and was beautiful. Perfect for the cross for my mother, and she loves it too. This is the second order from Gem Avenue and I have been very pleased with service, quality, and cost! Product purchased: Sterling Silver 1 MM Italian Box Link Chain 30"" Long Necklaces"
4,"Cute, but shorter than expected","Based on the length I actually expected this to be 'longer' than it was. (I've bought other necklaces that claim to be this same length that are much longer) There must be a difference in how different vendors measure their necklaces. Anyways, although it's a bit shorter than I would have liked it's still a nice good quality necklace for an awesome price."
4,Sterling silver necklace,I have bee wanted a small chain that I could wear a charm that I already had. I ordered the 18 in. But should have ordered the 20 in. It still worked out. I can wear my charm now. I just wish it hung a tad bit longer.It came a little earlier than was expected so I was happy about that. I' thankful I now have a nice sterling silver chain to wear my charm.The clasp is sturdy and works fine. It is made well.
4,great!,This necklace is great. it was the perfect length i was looking for and it is nice and sturdy!! Coudn't beat the price!
5,Very nice for price,"I ordered a size too short; however, this Ida very attractive chain. Recomend for young girl or anyone who prefers lighter look"
5,Fabulous necklace,I love this necklace. It is beautiful as well as strong. The clasp works perfectly. I was afraid it would be a cheap clasp but I am pleased to say that it is not. I highly recommend this product.
2,Cheap quality,"Granted, I knew it wasn't going to be amazing based on the price but I didn't expect hair strand thin. I expect it to break within weeks (maybe days)."
3,It's okay,"Links of the necklace are more small than I thought. The chain is more fine, will be easily broken, and not sturdy enough for some of my pendants for which I bought the chain. The chain is beautiful and dainty, just more dainty than I expected."
5,love it!,i got the item on time and when i open the box i was not disappointed. i like that its not too thin. i think its durable and would last long. so happy with my purchase
4,Feminine,"I purchased this chain as a replacement for my husband's necklace. Sterling silver, so obviously great quality. However, due to the delicacy of size, it gives off too much of a feminine vibe. It's a bit too thin and sparkly. I now have it for myself though. I think it should be removed from the ""men's jewelry"" section."
1,Tarnished,After my husband wore this for over two weeks it turned black. I was so shocked and disappointed...I am not sure if others are having this problem....we were disappointed and we are able to return it for a refund....yea Amazon!
4,Great gift,I got these for my daughter for Christmas along with some beads and bracelets. She has had alot of fun mixing and matching them. Thisis a good value!
3,"Delivery fine, Item eh","The chain arrived very promptly, but within a few weeks had discolored to a unappealing dark grey. Disappointing, but you get what you pay for."
4,"14"" Sterling Silver Necklace","This is a lovely link necklace that will complement and enhance any pendant, locket, etc. I am comfortable recommending it."
3,Silver necklace review,"Is much thinner than expected, but, still very nice. Hopefully it can withstand having a pendant hung from it. Will be used to hang a Saint Christopher medallion."
1,It broke right after return window expired,Chain is dainty and pretty.Broke in less than a month.Present for Daughter. She wore it a few times before it broke. Cannot be repaired. :(
1,NOT IMPRESSED,"I ORDERED THIS CHAIN TO WEAR WITH A WHITE GOLD ONE CARAT DIAMOND PENDANT I OWN, I PUT IT ON THE CHAIN AND IN THE FIRST WEEK, THE CHAIN BROKE, NOT AT THE CLASP BUT ABOUT 3 INCHES FROM THE END...I ALMOST LOST MY DIAMOND, I WOULD NOT ORDER THIS CHAIN AGAIN."
5,Wow!,"It is always a pleaseant surprise to find quality and good price for a product. The chain is well made, excellent quality. I love it and wear daily. I would recommend this chain to anyone. They took the time to protect the chain through delivery. I was impressed by the speedy delivery time and overall experience with the comapny. Would I purchase again? ABSOLUTELY!"
5,Beautiful,It was so great to be able to find such a great quality chain on-line. It was a gift and was adored. I would definately recommend it to others.
5,Very beautiful silver chain,I love this sterling silver chain! We bought it for our 10 y.o. daughter and finding a 16-inch chain was key. The chain came in many other lenghts too. Our daughter wears it with her sterling silver cross pendant everyday! The cost was very inexpensive for the quality. And the item was shipped immediately. Thank you!
5,Made a wonderful gift!,This was exactly what I was looking for. My son had asked me to help him find a pretty but sturdy chain for a claddagh pendant he was giving his girlfriend for christmas. This was perfect.It's very strong and looks great. Shipped fast too. Best of all she loved it!
5,Excellent!,This necklace was purchased for a Christmas present. My sister loved it and it holds the pendant well .
4,sparkly sparkle,I brought this for my birthday and I just love it works great with mostly any silver charms I have
4,Love it.,"I am very pleased with the quality. It is just what I needed. It is long enough for me. I don't like anything too close to my neck. I'm now thinking of ordering a 20"" to wear together. Love it."
5,"I've had these for a year now, and they still look good",This was a great price for a great necklace. Stayed just as it was delivered. I would definitely recommend this product!
4,Very nice!,Bought this necklace as a Christmas gift for my Mom. I'm going to put Pandora beads on it of my chosing.. she's going to love it! The necklace is the perfect length and wonderful condition!
5,Beautiful chain.,I wear this chain every day and have since I bought it. It is beautiful and sturdy and I highly recommend it to replace the tiny store chains to keep the pendants on them safe.
3,Decent chain,Good chain to hang a small pendant from. Picture shows a nicer clasp than what you actually get. It's just a plain little spring ring cheapie clasp.
2,It broke the first day.,"I purchased this for my daughter for her birthday. The chain itself (not the clasp) broke within a few hours. I don't know if it was a fluke or something, but she has been wearing one of my similar chains for two months and it is fine."
1,DON'T Buy the silver turns to black in a couple of months past the return date.,"I've worn this neclace for about 2 months and it's black now, never had that happen with a silver chain. Don't waste your money."
5,silver chain necklace,Good quality and great price.I added a silver charm and it made a great gift. I bookmarked your site so I can order more in the future.
4,Better than expected,"Decent 1mm chain. Sturdy. It holds up well to 10-15mm diameter gemstone pendants. We ordered the 22"" length and are pleased. Works well for costume jewelry and charms. I wouldn't buy this to hold expensive jewelry. I could see how some might have trouble with it holding up over long term. For $16.99, it's a decent piece of jewelry."
2,sterling chain,This is not a sterling silver chain!!! I can only wear real sterling or gold everything else gives me a really bad rash.The only thing I can give it is it's pretty.To bad it's not as advertised.
2,Tarnished/turned black within a week!,"I've been wearing nickel free sterling silver chains for most of my life, and never have I had any of them turn black - especially not within a week of putting them on! This chain was extremely disappointing, and while it didn't mark my neck, I was embarrassed to wear it because of the discoloration. It washed easily enough in a silver jewelry cleaner but I'm now hesitant to wear it again because of how obviously low quality it is."
5,What a bargain!,"I have purchased sterling silver online before, but this italian box chain was a great deal. The quality was excellent and the price wasexceptional. And the fact that it is available in at least 7 lengths israre."
4,great gift,this was a gift for a friend. That person let me know they liked the necklace and the pendant that was sent.
5,Sterling Box1MM Italian Chain,I really like this small chain. It is gorgeous and looks as good as the picture. I am very pleased with the prompt shipping. I will order again from this vendor.
2,pretty but...,This is pretty but it broke very easily! Although I do have a little one that is al ways touching it. But I felt it should have lasted a bit longer. I wouldn't buy again.
5,beautiful and elegant,The necklace arrived quickly and is beautiful. It is very elegant but simple. It is made with a small clasp so I can change what I put on it easily. I love the shorter length also. I bought the sixteen inch so it doesn't get hidden by the top I'm wearing. I love Amazon for their quick shipments and wide selection and great prices! Thank you Amazon!
5,very pleased,Recieved this lovely little chain and it was just what I wanted. I ordered the 14 inch chain for my grandaughter and it will be perfect for her little charm. Seems to be sturdy and durable but feminine. Would recommend it to everyone!
4,Italian Sterlingt Silver Box Link Chain,I bought this item to replace a broken chain that holds a silver heart. The item is really niceand looks good with the charm. I would have gone for a heavier chain if I had realized what thesize was. It is a nice chain though and I would buy again.
3,Deceptive Photo,"The clasp is not like the one in the photo, which is the whole reason I chose this chain. I am not happy. The chain however is very nice."
5,Just what I needed,I purchased this to replace another chain which I had accidentally cut with a pair of nail clippers. It's the perfect length and size for a pendant I got for Christmas.
4,Good necklace for my pendants,I needed a chain for the pendants I purchased for my bridesmaid. It looked really nice and will prevent any allergic reactions.
5,Wonderful gift,"I bought these to put pendents on for my children as part of our wedding ceremony. They are perfect weight and complimented the pendent perfectly. I bought 3 of these and they arrived quickly. Procrastination can be a downfall when ordering online. These came in just a few days. The silver boxes made it easy for me to ""marry"" the pendents with the chains and then put them back into the boxes to be presented on our wedding day.Thank you"
4,lovely necklace,"I was looking for a necklace to hold a locket. This necklace is very lovely but not the right match for my locket (I need something heavier in weight). Even so, I will keep this necklace to use with another piece. All is well."
5,Beautiful and Well Made,I am still astonished with the quality of this product. The box link is gorgeous and very well constructed. The chain is stamped (sterling silver) and looks and feels expensive. I wear this chain constantly and it still looks like it did when I first received it. I highly recommend this product. This product is under priced. Did I just say that aloud!! Cheers!
4,Not for men,"The necklace very sturdy and strong, I am 5-6 tall and 24"" was perfect for my neck. I really love this necklace but is too shiny and it looks like female necklace and very thin. I'm afraid to wear it, so I gave it to my sister, she loves it as well. I'm a little disappointed because the description didn't specifically describe about this necklace whether is for female or male."
1,Weak link,Please be advised that this is a very fragile item and if it breaks after 30 days (as was our experience) the company will not provide an exchange.
2,Poor Quality Control,"Bought this as part of a Christmas present for my girlfriend. When I got it, there was a long, sharp piece of metal sticking off the chain. It makes it impossible to wear without getting scratched, but don't have enough time to return it before Christmas. Will be contacting the seller for a replacement after the holidays."
1,no show,"It is past the due date & have yet to receive the product yet. I don't know if it's lost in the mail or what but, I'm not impressed."
3,You get what you pay for,"The chain is nice, but the clasp is cheap and doesn't open or close well. Nearly lost the necklace the first time I wore it because the clasp didn't close all the way."
4,Very pretty.,I like this chain. Very pretty. Seller sent it right away. Actually got it before the rest of my Amazon direct order.
4,nice necklace,I like this necklace it is very nice and looks good on me.It took no time to get to me and I was very happy with the necklace...
5,STERLING SILVER CHAIN,"I LOVE THIS CHAIN. GREAT PRICE, PERFECT CONDITION WHEN I RECEIVED IT. IBOUGHT IT FOR MY NIECE FOR HER BIRTHDAY AND SHE WAS THRILLED.I WILL BEPURCHASING MORE JEWELRY FROM GEM AVENUE!"
4,Very nice,I purchased this with two other items for my mom. The chain was in excellent condition and I truly am pleased with it.
1,Quality of effectineness,"I have used the ""Krisk"" bean slicers for more than 50 years.I tried this type and was so disappointed. It is useless.A waste of effort even trying to use it."
1,Piece of junk,I purchased this to replace a similar device that was getting old and rusty. The new device was so dull that I had jam each bean into it. I ended up with a bleeding thumb. I used a vegetable knife to cut the beans and will continue to do so until I can find a device that actually works.
1,Didn't work well for me,"I followed directions, inserting the green bead with threads to the sides and it didn't work well. I'll be looking at another brand."
5,Nice Little Tool,"I found this tool very easy to use, I cut beans while also watching television. It works very well for it's small cost. I can small amounts due to having only 2 people in my family, so only cutting 1 bean at a time is not really an inconvenience for me compared to the cost and having to use a larger cutter attached to the counter in the kitchen."
4,worth purchasing,"Its cheap and effective. so long as you arent trying to jam anything other than a bean through it, it should last for a long time."
5,Works great and is fun to use,"I bought the slicer after seeing a cooking show where the cook used one exactly like this. Since then I have used mine and it perfectly slices beans, even taking off the outside stringy part. Well worth the cost!"
5,Norpro Green Bean Slicer,My wife and I think this is one of the best gadgets in our kitchen. It makes preparing green beans so quick and easy.
1,Poor design,"This french bean slicer doesn't work at all! I own one that is old and rusty, so I purchased this new. Horribly constructed."
1,Hard to use,This was a waste of money. Very hard to use. I ended up purchasing the Norpro French Bean Slicer with the hand crank. I really like that product.
5,Download.,I downloaded this item when i received amazon mp3credit and it was great! I have always loved Muse and this song.
1,Didn't like it,"I ordered this thinking it was music from Nickelback and to my dismay found it was only history of the band. No where in the description of the cd did it say it was only words and no music until I received the cd and it read so on the back. I sent it back for a credit. Did not want to add this to my ""music"" collection. If I want to know a biography about a band I will read a book or magazine."
3,Not a music CD,"I'd just like to warn everyone that this is not a music CD. It is a spoken word product which basically gives a general history of Nickelback's roots and influences. While it is an interesting story, there is NO music on this CD."
1,This cd stinks,"I was v ery disappionted with this purchase. It said greatest hits, but there was no signing. Justgn very annoying talking. Buy this at your own peril. Very miksleading. If you want one I'll give you mine."
1,What a waste of plastic!,"Giving it 1 star is too many - I just received this CD and I was totally disappointed what garbage it all talking and no music DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! If you want the one I got send me a self addressed envelope and I will give it to you, it like a High School student did it, and her voice gets very annoying after a while it's like another reason for a British woman to bring up the BeatlesOh and the case is broken from poor packing"
4,track listings,"what i dont get is that it says ""track listings"" i thought it meant songs and stuff then i looked at the comments and it said it was a biography cd with poster. but anyways i wouldnt mind a biography and learn more about nickelback. if you are a person that loves nickelback and wants to learn more about them, this is the cd for you!marley:)"
4,delicious woody scent-lovely for winter,i got this as a christmas gift and i can say it's such a wierd looking design as a bottle but the perfume kinda grows on u unlike my other perfumes...not my first choice but my husband loves it on me so what am i complaining...:)
2,I just dont understand it,"Okay, I have to say this is the wierdest scent I've ever come across. It's a very dark woodsy smell that gives you chill when you breath it in. It's cold... there's no warm to it at all. There is a hint of Jamine maybe but that's counter acted by an intense bitter root afterglow. After wearing it for a couple of hours I'm not happy to report that I actually became nauseated. I really tried to embrace the diversity of this scent, give it a shot and not judge it to harshly but unfortunately my physical reaction won out. Go ahead and try it if you enjoy unatural unearthly scents. My recommendation is to get a sample first of course, but I have to warn you; It just may jump start a vomit!"
4,Good deal,Good buy. Not a copy but the original. Get lots of good comments when I use it. Very nice smell
5,The basics are still the basics - even old and out of date,"This is NOT a get rich quick scheme. It is diligent consistent work. The basic principles are the same today as they were in 1985. The financial world has changed dramatically in the past couple of years, therefore owner financing is even more important today. If you do what they teach you, you will benefit and learn. The reason people don't succeed is because they aren't willing to put the work in that is necessary to do each step and make 100 calls for only 1 yes."
4,wow,"Jennifer Montgomery's controversial, bravely autobiographical film takes a disquietingly original slant on underage sex. A 14-year-old starts an affair with her dorm counselor, who's into photographing his students in the nude. It's a relationship that won't stand still for parental interference or even investigation by the FBI, some years later. The director's deadpan, seemingly objective style downplays the outre subject matter and leaves the viewer to decide what is meant by the age of consent. ""Sexually frank...startling"""
2,"Disturbing, poor quality","The loose format reminded me of Blair Witch. The film was choppy and the sound quality was horrible. I wish I would have noticed that it is black and white before I purchased it.The movie opens with a few photos of adolescent girls, including one with a clear genital shot bordering on pornographic. The main character is a 14-year old girl portrayed by an actress clearly over 18. The only thing immature about this girl is her acting ability and the script.My girlfriend thought the movie accurately portrayed the insecurity and lack of self-confidence most 14 year old girls feel about themselves and there bodies. Maybe if the actress at least appeared to be 14? Maybe not."
5,Can a cable be a work of art?,"Apparently, yes, it can. I have been plugging things into other things for years (former DJ), and this is without a doubt one of the nicest pieces of cabeling I have ever used. The plugs/connectors are beautiful and appear to be of very high quality. This is not a heavy-duty commercial grade cable, but it is far and away the nicest home-use cable I've ever owned (including some Monster stuff). Lovely piece and well worth the price. The three connectors are color-coded to match the colors of the input jacks on yout TY: yellow, red and white. If you spent the bucks on a nice iPod, it deserves a nice cable too. You will not be disappointed with this item (and I'm very particular about my gadgets)."
4,"I hate to say it, but ...","This may be more interesting than the original.I love the style _ I grew up on the finger picking of Mississippi John Hurt and Elizabeth Cotten. But (with a little bit of remorse), I like this album better than listening to MJH because there's variety _ on his albums, one song tends to run into another.The material's great, although not every version is perfect. I like the Jerry Garcia-Tony Rice rendition of ""Angels Laid Him Away'' (The Pizza Tapes) better than Lucinda Williams' (and I'm a big Lucinda fan). I note a lot of comments on Victoria Williams' cut here _ for three minutes, it's a hoot. The Earles, Taj Mahal and John Hiatt are also worth the price.Overall, a nice listenable album."
4,"If you are an Audrey Hepburn fan, you'll love it.","The songs that you find in this cd are from some of her most memorable movies. Personally, the best song is the last one of Audrey singing ""Moon River""."
5,Mount Lowe from Amazon,"Seller said it was used, but like new. I'd say more like brand new! I could not be more pleased!"
4,bender robot,"Very cute, but not very durable. One of the latches broke when we first played with it. Not good for a child's toy, but any adult fan of Futurama would probably enjoy having this."
4,This ain't for kids; a robot that smokes ciggies and guzzles booze!,"There. Politically incorrect diatribe aside, this isn't for kids.When I got mine, and upon removing the packaging of my lovable rascal, there was this funky smell and Bender had a slick feel to the case. So I'd advise washing it, and your hands, before really winding him up.Bender is reasonably well built, and at 9"" is a terrific size. And the reflective version has grown on me (I bought both reflective and matte versions.)Best of all, he's educational because, when people ask, I say ""He's the lovable rascal from 'Futurama', a show written by a bunch of folks with PhDs!""Not a bad price, but wash or burn (and/or get high from the smell)..."
4,Very good,"Very good. Great pictures, simple text and very easy to understand. Very strait to the point tips. I do recommend it for beginners, like me (but read them as you identify the problems; the risk of reading everything like a normal book may overwhelm the beginner with too much information). A reference book to consult for the years to come."
4,not for beginners,"This book isn't recommended for beginners who are looking to pick up the game for the first time. I consider this more of a reference-type book. The way the book is structured - listing 80 common faults - can confuse the beginner by overloading the head with too many details. Golf is a hard enough game as it is and filling one's head with so many swing mechanics will definitely make the game more challenging and discouraging even. When professional golfers are asked what their secrets are and most of them will answer by saying: ""keep it simple."" For me, I try to keep only three things in my head while going through the pre-shot routine.This book is more suitable for intermediate and advanced golfers who want to refine their games by targeting weak areas, and book will help you do that. The golf swing should feel natural and uncluttered with details. Once you get beyond the initial hurdles, this book will help you spot-check your swing..."
4,Easy Installation - Necessary Option,"I purchased this Mobility Kit for installation on a Makita G6100R generator. In the past, I had always made my own wheel kits for water pumps, generators and the like. This time around, I thought I would see how the ""pros"" do it. The Makita kit contains good quality components, and the instructions were lucid. My only slightly negative comment lies in the fact that the kit obviously applies to several models of generators and water pumps, and thus wheel spacing is variable. To account for this Makita simply gives some large washers to prevent the wheel hubs from contacting the generator frame. While this is effective, it is a shoddy method of accomplishment. All in all, and all grousing aside, the kit is cost effective if you value your time to any reasonable degree...and your back will thank you every time you have to move your gargantuan generator."
4,Gerry and the Pacemakers minus the ferry,"This is a good collection of music from Gerry and the Pacemakers. The sound is good too. The CD is made up of 2 LP albums; `Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying"" and Second Album'.Most of the music is not the well known songs of this group; it does not include Ferry Cross the Mersey. It does contain 23 selections:Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying, I'm the One, Away From You, Jambalaya, Maybellene, You'll Never Walk Alone, How Do You Do It?, You're the Reason, Don't You Ever, Summertime, Slow Down, Show Me That You Care, I Like It, A Shot of Rhythm and Blues, Where Have You Been, Here's Hoping, Pretend, The Wrong Yo Yo, You Can't Fool Me, It's Happened to Me, It's All Right, Girl on a Swing.It is interesting to hear their well done versions of Jambalaya and Summertime. It certainly transports you back to that part of the British Invasion."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"This series is very well written. Once I started I couldn't stop! I have read all of the first 7 books and anxiously await the next two! Lots of adventure, love and excitement! Well worth reading!"
5,Great manufacturing management book,The book does not go into great detail but it is worth reading because it explains everything you need to understand how a manufactoring company has to work in order to achieve full controll over its business processes. The examples are very simple but very usefull. It is also a good book for people that do not have a background in manufacturing because it explains everything you need in order to understand the main subjects.
4,real fine,"This is indeed a real fine place to start your exploration of Radney Foster. This is the most accessible and pop like you are likely to ever hear Radney. He might be betraying his more country or alt-country fans but this record should appeal to the masses. The songwriting is not his best but it is better than most ever get. The production, musicianship and harmony vocals are all first rate as well."
5,ROCK ME SOCK ME,I must say my daughter made me get this cd for her one of her friends saw the girls and got a cd where they played .I love it these songs are just great from Rock to R and B to tear jerkers to Reggie these girls can really sing no way would I ever think they were young girls except when they sing sweet songs a really great CD for you not just your kids .....Jennie's Dad
5,Xcelite Best hand tools available,"I have owned Xcelite screw drivers and wire cutters for over 30 years. I have about a dozen or so of different sizes. They are the best you can buy. (Check out the different sizes) Quality is outstanding. I have never broken one to this day. A little pricy but if they last long and are dependable, what else can you wish for.I was in the TV repair business and most techs use Xcelite tools.Highly recommend without reservation."
3,"Good, but undistinguished.","Roy Bentley, Boy in a Boat (University of Alabama Press, 1986)Boy in a Boat is not a bad little book. Not at all. There are a number of very good poems here, and most of the rest are good, occasionally slipping down into the territory of average. Overall, though, it's an above-average collection. The problem is, there's really nothing to distinguish it from hundreds of other above-average poetry collections put out by University presses; no reason for me to say ""buy this one, rather than these others over here."" But if you happen to have the disposable income and are looking to pick something up that will be enjoyable and look better than the newest Jodi Picoult non-thriller while you're reading it on the bus, Roy Bentley is certainly one of the avenues worth considering."
5,filter,My wife says it is a great filter at a great price. I was happy it got here so quickly and undamaged.
4,Improves Landscapes,"I wanted a graduated filter, but this filter almost seems a little too gradual. By the time the sky is dark enough, some of the grayed area covers the landscape as well. This may be due to the APSC sensor in the Canon T1i, however. It's a little difficult to use, but this will probably remedy with practice. I have a HOYA ND that is also ND8, and it is darker than the Cokin filter. I was a little disappointed by that. Definite improvement in picture quality, though."
4,Works great!,"It is difficult to find accessories like this for the Sansa View. I use this on my Ubuntu linux desktop and it works great. It charges the unit and allows me to transfer music and video right to the View.It also has a standard ""Line Out"" connection."
2,waste of moneyt,"DO NOT waste your money on this, you don't need it. I tried every which way on my notebook to charge it and nada. I finally got my flip camcorder charger out and it works perfectly. All the gadgets that they are trying to sell you are a waste of money any old charger will work. I'm calling amazon to get my money back on this useless gadget."
1,Graceless,"I am sorry to say, that the Item, Griffin 9211-SNSADK PowerDock for Sansa, failed to survive my ownership. As I was opening the package, I managed to drop in onto my concrete floor. I havent attemped to reassemble the piecesyet, so I cannot speak to it's vertues.I recieved a request to send positive feedback from the sender, and also managed to screw that up. I sent them an apollogy for lack of feedback,but it was probably not accepted. The purchase on the whole was not one I would repeat. I'm out the Item, and the vender is out their feedback.Owen Schmidt"
3,"One function, but not both","Other reviewers said they plugged speakers into the line out jack and had nice results, but with the USB connection in, I can't get sound out. I only see the revolving sansa flower and see the word ""connected."" So, it doesn't do what I wanted it to do, which was charge and play at the same time.I've tried it with speakers and headphones - no luck.Also, the little rubber bumper brace pads seem too small for the 8 gig fuze."
3,One Major Flaw,"I've purchased 2 of these docks. The USB jack on my first one failed after a few years, so I just bought a replacement.The second one confirmed a flaw I had found on my first - the left and right channels are reversed. On my first one I was able to disassemble the dock, split the ribbon cable that connects the docking connector to the PCB, and resolder the left and right wires in the corrected places. Looks like I'm going to have to do that to this one too.Otherwise it's a fine dock, could be a little heavier, but oh well."
1,Do your research .....,"The product is alright. First, it doesn't come with a wall charger. Which you will have to buy seperate if you want to charge your Sansa other than from your PC.MOST IMPORTANT!!!! Sandisk has released a Power Dock for the Sansa which plugs into the wall and has a remote control. I found out the hard way, needless to say i own both of them.Amazon offers the Sandisk version of this dock, just do a search!"
4,Definitely worth the discontinued price,"Just wanted a way to easily attach my Fuze to my stereo and charge it that was a little classier than leaving the wires hanging when my MP3 player wasn't there. Would it be nice to have a remote? Shouldn't it come with a wall charger? For $39.99 the answer to both questions would be a definite yes. For $11.99 and free shipping? No. The blue light is too bright and lights up my whole living room if the other lights are out. A dab of car touch up paint fixed that. The bumper is too thin as well. I cut the mounting nubs off of the thinest bumper and glued it to the fattest one, problem solved. So for the price and a little work, I got what I wanted and am satisfied with the appearance and sound. Now if this were a Sansa review I would have to rant endlessly on why you would build a descent MP3 player and then not have any accessories for the damn thing..."
4,At least very good taste and natural,"I'm not sure how healthy these bars are. I am vegetarian and not picky eater but I don't eat much not organic or processed food (e.g. no douhgnuts, no oreo coockies, no gold fish, etc.).I don't mind spending money as long as it is high quality.I just tried these bars and I really liked.I respect other opinions but sometimes people think that they eat healthy or good bars only because they taste to pop tarts, zone bars, or other bars."
2,Tastes like soap,"I love supporting any type of gluten free 100% Organic energy bars. And from the package this looks to be a wonderful energy bar packed with lots of the good stuff. However, it tastes like soap to me. At first, I thought it might be the banana, but my palate screams soap. Trust me, I realize I'm not eating a calorie packed chocolate bar when I purchased these. But I expected the taste to be better. I could only eat a 1/4 of it and can't get the soap taste out of my mouth."
1,these taste terrible,i try a lot of different energy bar and breakfast bar things and strive to find healthy ones that also taste good. these go raw spirulina things taste awful. i tried to eat one while on a bike ride and after a bite or two had to spit it out. i even stuck my fingers in my mouth and wiped off my tongue. i can only think that when these go to sleep at night they dream of being an oatmeal raisin cliff bar.whoever created these things hates people or has a cardboard tongue. i have a pretty forgiving palette. i eat everything but i couldn't get these down. it literally made me gag.be warned.. these are terrible unless you have no taste buds.sorry Go Raw.... but that's my experience.
5,Good Comfort Read: still rings true,"This is a book that I found at an old library book sale, and it remains one of the best book for teens that I've ever read. I just re-discovered it in my room last night, and I re-read it. I would highly recommend this book, because so many of the issues in it are ones that we as a culture have to face still today, even with the 80's far behind us. I especially like how the book explores teen drinking, showing that it isn't necassarily a good idea, but also not taking a preachy approach to it. It's a feel good book without putting you in ""sugar shock,"" as one reader aptly named it. You'll laugh out loud, you'll feel sorrow for Collin, and Ms. White will have you wishing for more after the last page."
1,A waste of money,I felt this book was a waste of money. I knew more about the singer than the author. It is basically a mini-collection of magazine articles that I have purchased and read.None of the information was new to me or any other real Usher fan. I could have kept my 11.95 and bought a real book with new and interesting information.
2,"Good idea that was ""lost in translation""","The original book was written, so I understand, in Korean and was translated to English. Maybe it read better in Korean, b/c it's rather difficult to read through what is essentially at times, broken english.I liked overall idea of the story. A young boy who revolts against traditional values, finds love in Go and a woman; however, the execution of the book left a lot to be desired. I'm attributing a majority of the errors, poor connections between paragraph thoughts and broken ideas to a ""loss in translation"".I was rather shocked at the high ratings given of the book. If you like Go, the book is okay for the sake of Go. If you don't know much about Go and want to learn, I highly recommend Janice Kim's, ""Learn to Play Go"" series. If you are just looking for a good read, STAY AWAY from this one."
5,Enter into a Go-Reality Life,"This is the novel for Go player and in it, you enter into the world of Korean society, education, GO-pro wannabe, hustling and more ! You won't regret it and will be hooked.I hope it can be made into a movie and it will be rated ""R"".The only grip I have is the paragraph formatting need improvement for future edition.Other than that, this is a keeper and a winner :)"
4,Very rewarding..in the right order...,"As another reviewer has stated, think about reserving 5-star ratings for music that is fundamental to your life experience...This album is very rewarding because of the craftsmanship in most of the lyrics and music. May I suggest the following edit/reshuffling of the tracks has been most satisfying to me:1. How do you feel (from the Toys soundtrack)2. Cruel3. I live in a Suitcase4. Eastern Block5. Neon Sisters6. Beauty of a Dream7. Thats why people fall in love (this song is so much more impressive and effective last in this set).Burn this, and see what you think, no?"
4,Dolby gets better and better,Dolby is a great artist who delivers solid pop songs that shine with creativity and originality. This album is immediately pleasant to listen to. If you like 80's pop music then this is definitely worth a try.
5,love this handy little steamer,"This steamer was shipped quickly and more than met my expectations. It collapses into a smaller diameter for storage, but is a good size for steaming. I had not steamed vegies much before I got this product, so I can't compare to other steamers, but it has us eating more vegetables. and that can't be a bad thing!"
4,"Works as it should,","though I would enjoy a little more space between the bottom and top racks. On the other hand, it might not fit in my pot that way."
3,"Good Structure, but Old and Outdated","This book was probably the standard over 10 years ago, but now this text is almost completely outdated. While many of the main cases are still good law, many of the note cases have been overruled or modified by more recent decisions. This book really shows its age when you reach the section on the 11th Amendment as you will find that the Rehnquist Court made sweeping changes in this area.Despite its age this book is still well organized, presenting fed jur in a manner that allows for the student to understand the sometimes many confusing aspects such as Fed Question jurisdiction and Erie.If your professor makes you use this text, you had better hope that he supplements the materials with current caselaw.If you want to buy a supplement for this text, I recommend the treatise by Chermensky."
4,Fits the whole fillet,Worked great to flip the whole fillet on the grill. Sharp edge can get under the fish easily to reduce sticking on the grate.
5,Jim Moore Guiding the Senior Housing Industry,"What a wonderful book. Such timely and invaluable information. If you are looking for Assisted Living 2000, you need to look at Moore's new updated and expanded version, Assisted Living Strategies for Changing Markets [....]"
4,Good but i feel the 3 star guy,"I am not a hater as the one reviewer so eloquently put it! but i think what the one reviewer who gave it only 3 stars.. feels that the early Black pioneers of that era were left out, which if not for them, this scratch DVD would not exist. but you know that's how it goes..the same happened to techno and house music, but overall the DVD is entertaining."
5,ZIGA-ZIGA,ANYONE WHO LOVES MUSIC SHOULD OWN THIS DVD !!! THE DEDICATION OF THESE DJ'S IS INCREDIBLE.... GREAT LIFE LESSON... THE SECTION ON THE DVD WITH PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR IS AN EXPERIENCE IN ITS SELF... THE DJ'S SCRATCHING LESSON IS THE BEST....
4,Well made....BUT....,"Very well made and entertaining documentary that fails only in it's representation of the true pioneers of the craft. Far too much time is spent on Bay Area DJ's (QBert, Shadow, etc.), and while those cats certainly deserved their propers, there is absolutely no mention of Philly legends like Cash Money, Jazzy Jeff or Spinbad. These guys were absolutely pivitol in elevating the art of scratching to new hights (I'd even go so far as to say it's tantamount to ommiting Louis Armstrong from a history of Jazz). My only other criticism is that I sometimes felt the filmmakers were a bit too ambitious with their subject matter. There are far too many angles to cover (the scratch dj, the beat digger, the producer, etc.) to cover each one succinctly within it's 90 or so minutes. I've heard that there were interviews with Cash Money and perhaps others that were left on the cutting room floor. Hopefully they show up on the DVD."
5,Absolutely Essential!,"Goes down in my favorite hip-hop videos of all time.My favorites are this, breakin, breakin 2, and freshest kids.This actually helped lead me into breakdancing. From there I gotHow To Do The Robot - Breakdance Instructional DVDorTop 20 Breakdance Moves. These ones turned me from a hip-hop spectator into a serious breakdancer.All of these are essential!"
4,Great documentary on hip-hop.,"While this documentary is almost 10 years old, it's still a great window into the DJ aspect of hip-hop. (For those who don't know hip-hop consist of rap, DJ, breaking, and graffiti.) It's starts from Grand Wizard Theodore and Grandmaster DDT through to DJ Premier and Q-Bert. It mainly consists of interviews with a little show footage. It's great to see the history of DJ-ing and how it's evolved throughout the world."
3,Invest in better software!,"CD burner works fine, and ease of installation makes it worth 4 stars ... but HotBurn software is terrible ... I'm looking for compatible software that will work better with the drive."
1,No No for Mac,"I agree with the other negative reviews concerning Mac's and this CD burner. I burned 'part' of a successful CD with HotBurn, but still encountered many problems. HotBurn seemed so limited, I decided to invest in Toast software. Gee, whaddya know...Toast does not support this Iomega drive. So now I have spent [the money]. Roxio (Toast) support told me that Iomega USB 2 will not work with Toast. Iomega says that it will, but will just burn at slower speeds using a USB 1.1 NOT SO!!! Have no complaints against Iomega in general...just their claims..leading to uninformed purchasing. Now I have to either keep Toast or keep Iomega with Hotburn. Crummy decision to have to make. Either way, it's cost me extra money."
4,Great machine,"I have owned the Makita G6101R Generator for 5 years. This machine has been as reliable as anyone could want. When the neighborhood is dark, we are enjoying our house. Like every generator, this machine does require monthly or bi-monthly test runs to assure it is in top running order and the battery is charged. Easy to start with the electric starter, and relatively easy to move with the wheel package, I do recommend this generator."
1,ONLY HONDA'S RUN LIKE A HONDA,"PURCHASED THIS ITEM AFTER CAREFULLY REVIEWING ALL THE PRO'S AND CON'S WITH EACH BRAND. PRICE WAS NOT A MAJOR FACTOR BUT PERFORMANCE WAS. BRAND NEW OUT THE BOX SITS A YG6600DE FULL OF OIL AND GAS, AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF TRYING TO GET THE UNIT TO OPERATE PROPERLY- YAMAHA TELLS ME I HAVE TO RETURN IT TO A SERVICE CENTER. NEEDS ADJUSTING TO PREVENT THE GENERATOR FROM SURGING WHILE OPERATING A 1/3 HP GRINDER. I WAS ALSO TOLD BY YAMAHA THAT THIS WAS NOT A SMALL LOAD. I UNDERSTAND THE LOAD OF STARTING A MOTOR BUT COME ON, A 1/3 HORSE POWER GRINDER.. GIVE ME A BREAK. SO MY WORDS FOR YOU ARE, IF YOU WANT A HONDA BUY A HONDA..........KEVIN DAVENPORT"
3,Great for just drowning out the pain at the gym!,I like to listen to music that lasts a long time when working out. This artist keeps the tracks diverse and different on every song on the album. Great to dance too as well!
1,UnTrue,"This has ""Majic Carpet ride"" even in the title of song 6 and had no part of this song in it. On the video it was predominant. MISREPRESENTED and I would have loved to have returned. DON'T BUY, Wasted $16"
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!!,"When I saw this CD with so many songs I like for $6 I thought it was a great deal... WELL! What the site doesn't tell you is that all the songs are covers... and not good covers I might add!! If I wanted to hear bad cover acts, I'd goto a bar. At least $6 would get enough alcohol in me so that I wouldn't care what music was playing. If you want these songs, try to find the cd singles in a local shop... at least then you will know what you are buying. Thanks for the warning, Amazon!"
2,A bit of a disappointment from Twining's usual good quality,"I have prepared this tea according to instructions and how I prepare every other cup of tea: Steep about 4 minutes. However, this tea is either dry or I got a strange batch because it becomes quite bitter very quickly. The sweet, floral jasmine flavor is present but again--with a bitter tinge. And I'm not about to start putting sugar in my tea.I won't be buying it again."
5,This is as good as tea gets!,"I drink several varieties of Twinings tea - some bagged and some loose - and Darjeeling is one of my two favorites (with Irish Breakfast Tea). It has a unique taste that's very smooth with a great aroma. It's robust enough that I drink it straight or with a few drops of lemon or lime juice. If I could only drink one kind of tea, it would be Twinings Darjeeling."
4,"good tea, bad package","Very pleasant tea but beware of the leftover foil on the top of the can. It's like a razor blade. Bad, bad design!"
4,Das's review,"Tea quality is very good, but I would prefer more leafy tea. Here the tea is combination is small leaf and dust but i would like big leaf only.regards,Das"
4,hits the spot,"For black tea lovers, this is great. A tea that has been around a long time. This is loose tea, for a more precise infusion. It is hard to find at all in the stores--and then only tea bags. Ordering from Twinings gives you many choices."
5,Extraordinary Ordinary Tea,If you are a person whose only experience with tea is grocery store blends that you don't exactly hate but really find too bitter then this is the antidote. Darjeeling is like those blends but it never gets bitter even if you walk off and leave it brewing too long by mistake. It is absolutely my favorite tea. Add a little orange blossom honey and it is perfect. There is nothing in this tea that takes getting used to. If you can tolerate a (famous brand) pekoe-black teabag then you find this tea to be a revelation.
5,Easy as ABC,"I found this book so easy to follow that I was cutting the hair of my two daughters in no time at all. My husband was so impressed that he let me cut his hair, too. I just followed the simple steps and illustrations within. If you want easy and simple, then this is the book for you."
3,I vote it fair,"Personally, I found it helpful, but not that helpful, if that makes any sense to you. And I also thought the illustrations were vague in my opinion and not very well done. They are just good enough that you can make out what she is doing, but barely and I really didn't care for that. I wanted something with good instruction and illustration, so I could see exactly HOW I should be doing it and HOW it should actually look. I felt these illustrations were not very helpful at all. But, all in all, if you are not really in need of pictures, then her instructions are fairly decent and you could go by them. I know this may be confusing, but it is just the only way that I could explain it!"
4,Earthy & powerful lyrics,"Her lyrics are amazing and powerful. Straight from the heart. You never get enough of listening to her album. I could listen to her all day and never get tired. She has a gift of capturing the mind,heart & soul. Thanks you Suzette for touching our hearts."
3,"too obvious, yet too unrealistic","It’s a funny thing: The principles that Dale Carnegie talks about are obvious, but they’re difficult to implement in real life. The greatest challenge, in my opinion, is conquering your own character traits that don’t let you behave the way you want. The best book on emotional control, which includes anxiety, is recently published Secret Techniques for Controlling Sadness, Anger, Fear, Anxiety, and Other Emotions by Vlad Koros. Koros guides you step by step using funny examples how to turn off your anxiety at will. I tried it on several occasions, and I can’t believe that it works! Once you can control your inclinations, you can try Carnegie’s advice. At least, I will."
5,Kauai Pamela,Love all Dale Carnegie books. Have read them over and over through the years. My grandfather & father read Dale Carnegie books in there day. Highly recommend!!
1,These M3's are fakes!,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. These are ""knock offs"" of the Gillette M3 Razors. They do not have the Gillette logo embossed on the razor and the orange strip will wipe off with just a touch of your wet finger. Worse yet these razors will tear at your face not shave it, very uncomfortable. Buy the real thing at your local drug store. This vendor is also not interested in making things right. Overall this is the worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon. Amazon should also be ashamed of hocking fakes on there web site."
4,Classy and touching,Heartfelt melodies and a mature economy of words make this a first class entertainment. Don Williams understands perfectly the fundamentals of pop music without selling out like some lesser country artists thank you.
3,Alt country here we come??,"On this album, Jason Hatfield- that's right he's Juliana's brother- finds the voice he's been developing on the past couple of albums. On Vapid Drivel the alt country twang becomes a larger part of Star Hustler's repertoire. This is not a bad thing. They pull it off quite well without over indulging in strum and twang."
2,sort of ok...,"This does work well for tenderizing meat but it rusted after 1 trip through the dishwasher. There is really no way to clean this by hand. Would be better if the spikes were removable for cleaning, and if it was a little larger. I used a cheap copper wire type scourer and pounded this into it to remove the rust but that is impractical as the scourer is junk after one use for that purpose. This tenderizer needs to go back to the drawing board."
5,Norpro Meat Tenderizer,The product was exactly as stated. I was very pleased with its performance. It arrived exactly on time. I will definately use Amazon.Com to order other items that I can not find in any local store in our area.
3,Pretty good product,"This meat tenderizer does pretty well but it gets stuck in the thicker part of the meat and you have to manually unstick the disk that moves up and down. Its not that big of a deal but it is a little annoying. I have only been using it for about a month now so I'm not sure on how it will hold up. To clean it, I rinse it with hot water, spray it with a sanitizer and then wash it in the dishwasher. It does get some water stuck inside the handle from the dishwasher but you can shake most of it out."
1,bad product,this product does not do a good job for what it is to do I saw one for comercial use that was vdery good but havent been able to find one like it I threw it away
5,Excellent Product - Good for a year or so,"I have owned several of these over the years. It is by far the best meat tenderizer out on the market. It is designed with ""nails"" that come down through a spring loaded base and goes thru the toughest meats breaking up the fiberous material and lets the meat absorb marinate.Yes, they will rust if you put them in the diswasher and let them stay wet. Yes, eventually they will come apart and stop working. I usually get about 2 or 3 years out of it. But I make sure there is oil on it and I don't let it sit wet. But hey, it's under ten bucks, it's plastic - what do you expect.Still the best functioning meat tenderizer on the market. It's also great to work on any kind of anger issues you could possibly have by beating the crap out of a steak!"
3,Handled tenderizer,Not sure I would buy this again. Purchased with a 48 blade tenderizer. No comparison in quality and function. Used this one once??
1,"Great idea, difficult to clean","I loved this product at first. It tenderizes the toughest meats fast. Makes marinades absorb even better. BUT- it rusted after washing in the dishwasher. Also- the flat part that pounds the meat-lost it's spring action. Also, meat juices got trapped on the inside, causing me concern when using with raw pork and chicken. Great concept- not perfected yet."
2,"Worked well, for a while.","I found the Norpro professional meat tenderizer a very useful tool for effectively tenderizing less tender cuts of meats and also for pounding seasonings into meat. I liked the long, sharp prongs much better than the usual shallow, dull surfaces of other tenderizers. This tenderizer has a retracting platform that protects the user from being injured on the spikes. However, after a few months' light use, the spring on my tenderizer broke and no longer controls the platform. The spikes are now exposed at all times, resulting in several minor injuries to hands, or whatever body part comes in contact with it. This product was wonderful while it lasted, but now is a hazard."
4,A bit of special care needed,"After reading the review I reconsidered but decided to give it a try but skipped the dishwasher. Immediately after use I soak it in a container of hot soapy water and swish a bit, rinse, swish it through another round or two of soapy water just to be sure that there is nothing left and let it air dry. I've found that this is pretty effective in getting it clean and its effectiveness in tenderizing is worth the extra effort."
4,Metal needs oil to keep from rusting,I like this tenderizer better than any I have ever used. It's only weakness is the plastic guide for the spikes tend to rotate occasionally and block the spikes from passing through. It would be nice if the other metal parts were make from a good stainless steel to keep it from rusting. I learned to spray it with cooking oil before I use it to keep it from sticking in the meat. After I wash it I also spray it with cooking oil because it keeps it from rusting. If you do not it will rust quickly at the base of the spikes which is apparently make from a cheap steel. For the price it is excellent. I would pay more for one made from quality stainless steel throughout.
2,Great... at first.,"I'll start with the good, it does tenderize meat very well. Makes even cheap ball tip steaks tender, and works equally well to better marinade chicken. Unfortunately it is designed in a way that dooms it to a very rusty and unclean death within a year. The handle fills with water as soon as you get it wet, and once that happens the metal spring inside rusts (see picture). Also like others have said, meat juice gets trapped inside which can't be good. I was thinking other reviewers were exaggerating until I saw how bad the problem was. SO I guess I'm saying it works, but it will eventually fail due to the design. I will not be buying another."
4,Fine supplement to a chopping block,"This product requires a chopping block or some other firm surface. If you use it to full effect on your formica counter you will be sorry, as you can actually dislodge the counter. It really is for chopping blocks free standing as an 'island' in your kitchen.For those of us(like me) who don't have 'islands', you can still use this. What you must do instead of pounding the heck out of the meat is to instead insert fully the prongs and then apply a small twist. This won't harm your table or countertop and will still open the meat's texture for seasoning or tenderizing."
4,awesome and easy to use meat tenderizer,This is the best tool in my kitchen. In 5 minutes your meat is tenderized with just a few pokes into the meat. 16 blades into your meat each time you poke it.
4,Great product,This product allows your marinade to quickly infuse the meat and reduces the amount of time necessary to marinate.
5,Easy to use,Have been using this product for years. It is light weight and is great for home use. We use it on pork & beef. The price is also right as some tenderizers can be more expensive
4,Norpro Meat Tenderizer,Use it all the time.Either my butcher is supplying me with better grade meat(and not telling me) or its doing its job.With regards to needles sticking in the meat I spray the needles with oil. After use- clean and dry it then spray needles with oil then into the drawer
2,Need to keep looking,"Like most other poor reviews the spring stopped functioning after being used about a dozen times.If it could be opened up the spring could be fixed and it would be easier to clean.Cleaning it well is impossible. I solved guide binding by breaking it off and pushing the plastic rod into the handle. I'll take it to the office and fill in hole with acrylic plastic. You could also glue a small disk over the hole. Cheap price, poorly made product."
2,Not Good,This doesn't really work well. I shoud have spent more and gotten the better one. No way to really clean it completely so it is not real safe to use.
5,Simple yet profound - a must read!,"""God and You, Prayer as a Personal Relationship"" is an amazing little book by William A. Barry, S.J. It is simple, basic, and profound. I read it one chapter at a time, with time to ponder and put into practice what I read. Fr. Barry has written a truly remarkable book that touched me deeply - it would not be exaggerating to say that it was life-changing. I have already given it as a gift. There are many different ways to approach prayer, I feel sure that the reader will connect with at least one of the ways Fr. Barry discusses. Highly recommend!"
1,Consider the source,"You must consider source for this publication. Peggy Palms has a terrible reputation in her local market as one of the ""shadiest"" attorneys around. I have heard this from at least four of her fellow realtors, along with the personal experiences. I would not recommend her as a professional."
5,Where's the Update?,"A very straightforward, no nonsense and yet compassionate view of the problem. Gives a good deal of excellent advice, but sorely needs to be updated by the author to take into account the new law. Perhaps she is too busy in court."
5,Christmas Gift that I love,"I don't have an experiment based review yet, but I have put it together and it is VERY easy to assemble. My only complaint is that I make a LOT of pasta when I make it at home and I would need more than one of these to accomodate 1 batch if I were going to dry it and store. So, keep that in mind when you order. You need about 2-3 of these or you could bore more holes and cut your own dowel rods to accomodate more noodles. Your choice!Also, the rods are rough and unoiled. You would probably need to do some oiling with mineral oil for awhile to get it to where it will be easier to clean."
2,Disappointment may await the purchaser of this product.,"The drying sticks arrived mildewed. I soaked them in bleach and still have not got the mildew smell out of them. I am going to have to go to Home Depot and get some new sticks to make it functional. Other than that it is O.K. I purchased a ROMA pasta drying rack from Amazon and like it a lot better. In defense of the Norpro rack I will state that the center post is quite tall and lets you hang some long pasta, whereas, the Roma model is a little shorter."
4,Good basic pasta dryer,"It's a good basic pasta dryer. It's really just wooden dowels with holes drilled in them and a base, but it's sanded smooth and it works well. It's tall enough that I just left mine assembled and stuck it in the corner of my countertop where I had a basket anyway. The branches come out and it will dissemble if you want to do that too.I'm not sure what else to really say about it - it's about as basic as they come and it works."
3,good,"i didn't have the problems most had. watch out with the time you leave pasta on the racks, as it might dry out before you know it."
5,Norpro Pasta Drying Rack,"Works great. Heavy base makes it very stable. Easy to assemble, disassemble and clean. Highly recommended."
3,"It's OK, but unstable, and kind of pointless.","I thought it'd help, but really I find it gets more in the way than just laying it out. Sticks are too close together to really get pasta in there without doing it a few strands at a time (output from the KA spaghetti cutter is anything but one strand at a time...)Tt does kind of help when doing the sheets prior to cutting, allowing you to process all the pieces of dough to a given thickness before adjusting and running it through again, so in that sense, it's helpful..."
4,Great space-saving solution,"I love the mind that figured this one out. There's plenty of pasta-hanging area in a small space. Also, I love that I can take the whole thing apart and put it back in the box and keep it where I keep trays...easy storage.I did, however, get one that only had three holes drilled in it, rather than the four that it's supposed to have. For the price I can drill the fourth hole....I just have to get the right angle. I didn't return it because I was making pasta and wanted to use it right away.As another reviewer stated, the holes for the dowels are a little sloppy so the dowels slide out when removing the pasta, but I found that to be good because I just slip a wooden spoon handle under the pasta and slide the dowel out for easier removal of the dried pasta from the stand.I love this dryer.... inexpensive and very useful....and much better than propping sticks between the backs of chairs."
2,Flimsy & my pasta pulls the dowels out,"It's definitely a low rent kind of pasta rack, and it served its purpose initially, but with the flimsy construction, the dowels that pull out when you're trying to remove your pasta, and the inability to store it easily without taking it entirely apart and taping it all together made this not worth what I paid. A bigger base and screw in dowels would've saved this."
2,I replaced it :-(,"The dowels did not fit firmly in the holes, so that they would slide when I was taking pasta on and off. Also, it does not store well, if one takes the dowels out, you need a rubber band or something to attach them to the post so you don't loose them. I'm afraid I got rid of it and replaced it with one of the ones where all the (plastic) arms spiral out, and the tripod feet retract in straight -- and that has tucked into the center pole a really handy rod for hanging and unhanging the noodles, which I find surprisingly useful.However, if you were thinking about getting it, and storage is not an issue for you, and you don't mind fooling with it a little bit to get the dowels to stay firmly in place, there's no reason you wouldn't be happy with it."
5,Works as advertised--very handy indeed...,"This is a great little pasta drying rack, and the price is right. The main pole screws into the base, and the drying rods then get inserted through the main pole. The pasta sides off of the raw wood poles very easily when you are ready to cook it. Plus it all disassembles in a second to be easily stored, taking up little room. This is one of those rare kitchen devices that just effortlessly works from moment one, with no fuss or instructions needed. You don't realize how handy this thing is until you have and use it. I formerly laid my pasta out on the counter, which does work, but also promotes much more clumping together, even with lots of flour tossed about. This rack is a much better solution.It's a winner. I would say that if you are making a lot of pasta--for 4-6 people--that this might be a little small, and you might consider two of these units."
3,Stinky,"When I opened the shipping box that my pasta rack came in, the brown stuffing paper smelled as if it sat in mold. The box inside smelled of mold and as I took the pasta rack out of its box, it smelled of mold. The pasta rack did not have visiable mold on it but it smelled terrible. I quickly had to trash the boxes. I put the wooden rack out side to air out. I really looked forward to getting this pasta rack and to use it. I only left the rack outside to air out for an hour or so. I stored it away until I used it the other day. I put my pasta on the rack and the pasta smells of mold. I like the rack and fun to use but the smell is very dissapointing."
4,pasta drying rack,geat little product. pasta doesn't stick together any longer. can't beat the prise especially when bought as part of the package
4,works well,"easy to put together, works well, sturdy base, holds a lot of fresh pasta, does the job well for very little money"
2,Cheap,Sticks fall out of holes... as other reviewers have posted.. you have to very delicately lay on the pasta.. poor craftsmanship.
4,Great rack,"i really like this rack. it collapses and easily stores under counter (requires rubber band to keep dowels neatly bound to center spindle). it is light, cheap and does exactly what it is intended to do."
4,Did the job!,"It does just what you think it would, good buy for the price. Gave as a gift along with a pasta maker."
3,OK,"This is OK , but doesn't hold that much. I prefer to make small nests instead...much easier to store. But if you want to dry (not freeze) the pasta, this is not bad"
5,Quick and easy,"Rack stores easily, sets up quickly and provides drying space for double batch of noodles, spag, etc."
2,Too small for large amounts of fresh pasta,This item is too small for large amounts of pasta. It would be cheaper to purchase a large dowel and hang between two chairs.
5,A must Have,"If you make your own Pasta, You need the drying Rack. I started out just making the pasta Sheets and laying it out on the counter until I was ready to cut my Pasta, Trust me, This method takes up ALLOT of Space. The NorPro Pasta Rack makes life So much simpler, and takes up allot less space. Make your Pasta and Hang it until you are ready to cut it, Than you can hang your cut sheets to Dry if needed. if you are handy, It still wouldn't pay to build your own due to the price of this one. it's just a Simple Well thought out tool that dosen't require a Second Mortgage on the Home."
5,Grace Livingston Hill,"I have loved G.L.H. since I was young, and reading my mom's books. I have about 60 of them, so to get a new one, was wonderful."
2,Beginner Projects,"Unfortunately, little information was/is avaliable about this book on Amazon's Web Page. Projects sounded intriguing but it is a very beginner book. I did not go further than the table of contents."
3,Best Campy Movie Ever,"This has got to be the most indescribable movie I've ever watched. It's a Sci-Fi channel production, and while they hit the mark on a lot of their original series, they kind of fall short with movies. Seriously, though, Mega Snake is FUN. Definitely not the best movie ever, but when you have partially digested goats, cheesy plot devices, and MICHAEL SHANKS, the only answer is to get yourself a copy of Mega Snake, invite half a dozen friends over, order a pizza with everything, and just... marvel. It's one of those movies you can sit there and make fun of through its entirity, and when you get to the end, you haven't really missed a thing. Of course, if you're looking for meaningful and memorable, it's probably a good idea to look elsewhere."
3,Fun for laughs!,"This could have been one god-awful mess-=a typical Sci-Fi Channel offering where amateur film=making is the rule. Mega-Snake proves to be both witty and well-acted, filmed in an authentic setting with colorful characters. The monster is well-done and used sparingly, which proves effective in that you don't have time to see it's all computerized.This flick proves that you can make effective and witty entertainment on a budget and for two hours, there are worse ways to spend your time."
2,Bad,The only reason i gave it an extra star is because michael shanks character is believable. other than that a disastrous movie.
2,Movie was not good,I only got it because it had Michael Shanks in it & was cheaper to buy it used than to rent it online.
4,Mega Snake is scary,Michael Shanks shows himself to be quite versatile in the theater. I liked that the jar that preserved the snake had encryption on it ... Michael likes to play a cryptic archiologist. Excellent and did I say scary?
1,Megasucked,I don't understand how anyone could give this any thing else other than 1 or 2 stars.. the whole point of this movie was SUPPOSED to be to star a reality show (Who Wants to be a Superhero?) winner Feedback but he only shows up at the last 15 minutes of the movies for 2 minutes. IT'S DUMB!! I was so excited to see him there but what he did and how long he lasted just made him look like a big joke. Any fan of Feedback shouldn't watch this garbage.
5,A great gift for an adult,"Since this was purchased as a gift for an adult Elmer Fudd fan, I highly doubt that it will be used as a toy. It's more decorative. Therefore, I have no idea how fun or durable it is. The recipient was happy with it. Isn't that all that matters? :)"
5,Sands hits it out of the park,"Tons of wonderfully helpful guidance on how to sell yourself that has application way beyond how to hook a literary agent. Many many succinct and handsomely presented examples of pitching, all as related by a slough of experts who are on the receiving end of bushels of pitches. To be savored and digested in small doses and worth returning to over and over for renewed inspiration."
2,"Published in 2004, six years ago","This is just a note about this title, which would seem to be useful and encouraging based on reviews, title, and promo. So much has changed in these six years that no newer edition makes the book info suspicious to me. I always tell writiing students in college to use the newest and latest sources for research. Why shouldn't this apply? Perhaps another reviewer can address this issue, the rapidly changing book market and tone of our nation, etc., that would not be addressed in a book published in 2004."
2,Depressing for new writers,"Just about everyone who wrote chapters for this book were pretty clear that unless you have been previously published and/or have an MFA you are probably wasting your time, as most agents will not be interested in a first time writer's material, particularly one without the degree. I found the material in this book to be quite discouraging. My advice is to not waste your money unless you fall into one of the above mentioned categories. I'd put it towards getting your MFA or suggest self-publishing."
5,Perfect Pitch Scores a Homerun,"In the freelance writing world, the right marketing skills can mean the difference between survival or a career dirt nap. Talent often takes a back seat to persistence and preparedness --and only the strongest and savviest survive. Sands' book offers professional ammunition for the battle which will help any writer--both professional and neophyte--hone his or her target eye. I have been writing for a living for nearly ten years and don't often read how-to books. But Sands' keen insights and her no-nonsense but supportive voice gave me a bracing shot of career espresso. It is now on my work shelf next to the other tools of my trade: a twelve ounce coffee cup and Roget's Thesaurus."
2,Needs updating but still relevant,"Though parts of this book are still relevant, it does need updating. The examples in the book of products date back a while, however the reader still does understand the point the author is trying to get across. This is not the best example of a book like this, however it is a good read and gives you a pragmatic understanding of marketing."
5,Simply the Funniest Book I Have ever Read. EVER.,"Sorry, it's late, I'm tired and I'm not verbose anyway. I'm a huge fan of funny books and this made me laugh more often and harder than anything, ANYTHING, I've ever read. I only wish I could get my paws on a collection of his articles. My new favorite humorist hands down.Buy This Book!!!"
5,Lost and Found,"I must comment that when this was first ordered, we had it delivered to a P O Box, but to no avail. Apparently someone there either stole it, or delivered it to the wrong P O Box, but Amazon was quite nice to us, and sent aonther copy free of charge to our residence."
5,Changed my life!,"I read this at the age of 14.....I have read better books over the years but to me, it was as influential a book as I have ever read. I am a former Catholic clergyperson hoping to be ordained in the United Church of Christ. If anyone reading this knows how to contact James Kavanaugh, please thank him for me. If you know his email, please get it to me!"
4,Metallica - Tek Vest,"It was gift for 17 year old sons birthday, he loves it & wears it all the time now that it has cooled off outdoors."
1,Not worth the money,The nonstick coating has peeled off after one use... will return...not sure why they can't make non stick to be really non stick...really disappointed...
2,non stick surface peels off,"I have had this rack for a couple of years now and am shopping for a ""regular"" one. The black non-stick stuff sticks to the roasted meat and comes off the metal. Ick. Now mine is 1/2 black, 1/2 rusted."
2,Wish it was more durable.,"The fact that this folds and is adjustable is a terrific idea. But that's where the pros on this ends. It's not really dishwasher safe, so scrubbing roast turkey drippings off every nook and cranny of this thing is tedious, to say the least. Plus, as you scrub the burnt pieces off, what also comes off is the black coating. My hands were covered in flaking black coating after washing it this most recent time. If they only made it out of dishwasher-safe stainless steel, this would be perfect."
1,Terrible.,Did not like this product. The black coating flaked off the product when cleaned. Would not recommend anyone to purchase this product.
1,Beware! Not for hot ovens!,"I used this to roast a chicken at 450 and the nonstick coating melted onto the bird. Had to throw away my dinner and the rack both. I see from other comments that you're not supposed to use it over 400, but you have to wonder how much toxic material is being released into your food even at lower temperatures-- short of actually freaking melting the coating. And anyway, a ""roasting rack"" with that kind of temperature limitation isn't of much use to me.At any rate, I'll be seeking out a stainless steel rack, since in my experience stainless is really not that hard to keep clean, and has zero chance of filling my kitchen with fumes or painting my food with god knows what."
1,Not worth it,The rack is great for adjust-ability however as others have noted the finish is coming off the rack after a limited number of uses. It's never been used about 350 degrees and the finish is peeling off the rack portion as well as having completely come off the bottom. It's going in the garbage and I guess I'll switch over to stainless.
3,"Easy storage, short lifespan","We got this for Christmas a couple years ago, and loved the ease of storage. For our compact apartment kitchen, it can't be beat. We only use it a couple times a year, and after the third use, the non-stick coating started to come off. Never used it above 425 degrees (half an hour at most to brown a bit, then turn down to 325 or lower), always hand washed. Sadly, we had to throw it out this past week, because the non-stick coating was flaking everywhere. I'm back here on Amazon, looking for another compact rack, but will avoid any non-stick coatings, due to this experience."
2,Peeling Non Stick & Difficult to Clean,"I purchased this a year ago and have used it less than eight times, once for a turkey, the rest chickens. From the beginning it was difficult to clean. I've always cleaned it by hand, never in the dishwasher. Despite that, and like many other reviewers here, the non stick coating began peeling, almost after the first use and washing. I liked the price and the fact that I could use it with my broiler pan and not purchase a dedicated roasting pan and rack. But that's what I'm going to do. Trash the adjustable roast rack and buy a roasting pan with rack."
2,Paint chipping,"Not real thrilled as the black coating is coming off, need to cover with tin foil when I use it"
3,Nonstick peeled,"The rack itself works well and I like that it is adjustable. However, the first time I washed it giant flakes of the nonstick coating came off and I wasn't being rough with it."
3,Don't use at high temperatures,"This product is great but a word of caution; at temperatures over 400 degrees the nonstick starts to flake off, which can be dangerous if ingested. I contacted Norpro, whose response was that it was safe up to 428 degrees, however, mine did not perform well at 400 degrees. The manufacturer needs to put the maximum safe temperature information on the package and maybe test further."
2,Paint peeling off,"This rack worked great, but afterwards the 'paint' (I guess it's paint) started to peel off. Makes me wonder how safe it is."
5,ROASTING RACK,"THIS ROASTING RACK IS A LIGHT WEIGHT ,EASY TO USE PRODUCT.WILL FIT MOST SMALL PANS FOR EASY ROASTING.EASY TO CLEAN"
3,Good but don't think it will last long,I have used this once to bake a lamb roast. Did a nice job holding up a large piece of meat. I like that it is adjustable so that you can comfortably fit in a variety of different meats. My only comment is that I used it once and I cleaned it in the dishwasher. That might have been my mistake but when I got it out the coating was already chipping off. Concerning as no one wants that in their food and it doesn't say much for durability.So to summarise .. I like the product .. just not sure how long it will last. I think something without the nonstick coating might have been a better choice.
1,It would be nice,if the product description would tell you how many amps it outputs and other such useful info. Electronics can easily be damaged if you put more juice into them than they can handle...
2,aging performer,"Loved Barry 15 years ago, decided to by this live album. I'm a bit disappointed in the quality of Barry's voice. He's obviously aging. If you're a Manilow fan stick with thr older albums."
4,New Versions/Different Versions Of His Songs,"I like this new CD very much although I was greatly disappointed that Could It Be Magic and/or Could It Be Magic/Mandy from his Live CD was not included. I do have to say that Barry Manilow has not lost one ounce of his extreme talent or his sense of humor and, most importantly, still shows a huge amount of love and gratitude to and for his fans. Way To Go, Barry Manilow!!"
2,It's Time Barry to Move On,"Though Barry Manilow is in my top five all favorite singers, its time to put Mandy to rest and come back with a whole new list of unpublished songs. He has the talent and the opportunity to do so, so I can't understand why he keeps rehashing the some old songs from CD to CD. I'll pass on this CD, I already have the same songs at least 3 times."
2,"Lots of light, lots of noise","I picked these up to use in my bedrooms and used them for about a month. The light was too bright, the bulbs tended to buzz especially when dimmed, and they didn't dim nearly enough. I replaced them with dimmable LED bulbs and moved these to a bathroom fixture that was not on a dimmer. I actually gave the rest of them away to someone else and will be going with LED lights throughout the house."
5,Nice and unique,Bought for an anniversary present. It is big and heavy. Fast shipping and it was well packed. It has 2 feet on the bottom to stand upright and not roll.
3,Review,"It was decent. It had a couple really funny and witty moments, but I was mostly left wondering when it would get better or have a climax.."
5,Great couples book i loved it...,"Robert Koertge did a wonderful job writeing Stoner & Spaz. He led us through the book with two minds not one...the mind of colleen; a pothead without a clue where she is, and Mr. Perfect Cerebral Palsy movie freak wearing clothes that his grandma choose for him. This book is like a new romeo and juliet (something i havent read although ive heard about it). I would reccommend this book to all young adult readers i think everyone will love it, and if you dont thats you..."
3,It was okay,Stoner and Spaz was an okay book. It could have been better the ending was disapointing and I was expecting something more between the two main characters. The idea that some one will go all the way through rehab and then go back to drugs is believable but the fact that a person will get an aword for a movie on the first try is very unlikly.
2,Wasn't Worth Reading,"Though the book seems to have been well thought out, the characters were just too unrealistic. The ""stoner"", throughout the book was doing multitudes of drugs, acid, marijuana, hash, cocaine, etc which was understandable enough. But after she goes thru rehab she's fine. Like i mean, common! give her some withdrawel symptoms or something! Then overall, the story was just boring with an odd ending that was kinda half-assed. I dont know, i dont think the story was really worth reading."
2,Not Koertge's Greatest,"I read this book in two sittings, and though it had some humorous points, it wasn't at all poignant, which I'm sure it was intended to be. I felt the characters were unrealistic. I don't think that MTV's generation could relate to the character's since they're habits were of this time, but their attitude's and style are stuck maybe in the early '80's? Ben's constant attempts to make every sentence into a sarcastic remark tired me a tad. I felt there was no plot structure, sonsidering nothing really happened, and all through the store I felt like Koertge was constantly forcing the reader to give Ben and Colleen pity, which isn't fun for me. I was forced to read the book a second time, because I thought maybe, I hadn't comprehended or missed a part of the book. But to my disappointment, the story was just how I thought it was. I would reccommend this book to the younger teens, despite the drugs/sex, but I don't think older teens could relate."
4,"Great story, BAD ending!!","I really enjoyed reading this story!! These characters are complete opposites, and yet, they seem to fit together perfectly!! The only thing i didn't like about this sweet story, was the ending!!! It pretty much ruined the whole fairy tale element of the story, and i would suggest stopping reading around page 153! It is the point where the characters still seem to fit together almost magically, and in the 16 pages that follow, it kind of crashes. However, it is an intricately written story and i would definitely suggest reading it!!"
3,bitter sweet,"I loved this book in the beginning. They way it was written was something that i could somewhat relate to. Ben's pain and longing for affection felt real, he had hoped to always find it someday, when he finally did find it he did'nt except to find it so soon. I was so happy when learned about the other side of the tracks from Collen & when finally got to do something just for him by making a movie. But when it came to the end i was just so dissapointed. If you asked me to rate it while i was in the middle of the book it would get 5 stars of course! But the ending just knocked off 2 stars off. It left me hanging and i hate when that happens."
3,spaz,"I enjoyed this book because it felt real. How Ben felt about himself and his symptoms of cerebral palsy were so true. I applaud the author on deciding to write about someone with cerebral palsy. This is a topic never touch on in fictional books. This story is great as in you get to see Ben mature as he gets with Stoner... But I hated how Stoner never really cared for him, she just used him basically and Spaz (Ben) knew that and kept rolling with it. He was that desperate for affection I suppose. I wish the story ended a different way, that is why I knock off two stars."
2,Decent...,"The book basically starts you off with a predictale plot,boy meets girl,but the fact is the girl is a drug addict,a pot head, a druggie. This caught my attieon not knowing any of the author's books. ANother thing Koertge did was make the other main character have a disability. This madethe book a bitmore interesting, but the descriptions were plain dull. The plot was good,but was too boring, he didn't bring out the full potienal of the piece. The bookwasalso too short,itshould have been expanded, I finished the book within a day.The story basically took you through little ups and downs with Colleen and Ben, nothing that seemed out of the ordinary from the boy meets girl stories.If you want a short read,key word short, read Ron Koetrge's Stoner and Spaz and brace yourself for one hundred and sixty something pages of 80's styles, drugs, for a little sex, and horendous imagery."
2,Not as effective as the ceramic ginger grater,"I like those ceramic toothed ginger graters you find at Asian markets, so I bought this one because I thought it would be a similar tool but with a handle. Unfortunately, it doesn't work nearly as well."
3,Norpro grater not good for Ginger,"When you grate ginger, you need somewhere for the fibers to go or else you have to pick them out by hand which is what you end up doing here. It is a solid piece of metal without holes like a normal grater."
5,Easy Sitting Exercises with Bands,"I am very happy with this easy sitting exercises with bands. The exercises are easy and slow enough for me to do and I feel the difference and have gained more strength in just a few weeks since I started doing these exercises.The DVD is about 30 minutes and nicely filmed on a sunny beach, with music I like."
2,Over priced,"The model/instructor, one, needs to loose the teeth, she grins stupidly through the whole exercise and two, it would be better if she were positioned in a real chair."
1,This is the worst video I have EVER seen! I,"First of all, the model in the video looks like a waxed figure in a tourist museum. The exercises, although advertised as such, have absolutely NOTHING to do with Pilates. These is old fashioned, health club activities. They list on the cover states that doing these activities will burn fat, replace muscle loss, (how do you loose your muscles?) stopping bone loss, again HOW?The whole thing is one gigantic ""crock!"" DON'T BUY IT!!!"
5,Sex and Spirit is a beautiflly illustrated book!,"I love this book. I have used it to do some research on alternative sexuality (BDSM/Fetish) and the religious impact on our reproductive lives.I love the photos and illustrations: They help one see the beauty of our bodies and serve as visual Enneagram which capture our attention and illuminate the prose and scholarly information within.This a book for seekers who are wanting a spiritual approach to learning about sexuality and their spirit. It is not for religious prudes, ultra-conservatives who feel that sexuality if just for heterosexual procreation.This books takes you beyond vanilla and explains how religious institutions mapped out and claimed ownership of our bodies, forever changing our ability to see ourselves freely."
4,Ideal gift,"This book is a great gift for for any cook. Its provides exciting, simple and easy to follow recipes. There are modern and traditional recipes. I enjoy most of the recipes, especially the souffles. This is book is also great for its introductory understanding about eggs and for those who like to experiement with the many different ways to cook with eggs."
1,A Pop Nightmare...,"An immense disappointment considering that her first cd ""Drown Me In You"" was so brilliantly written and produced with a sound truly her own. As regards to ""Dirty Little Secret"", there was not a single decent song to be heard, though I tried desparately in vain to like one. If I could have given zero stars I would have. Stella, if you are out there...we miss you!!!"
1,Ruined a Great Song,"I was highly disgusted when I heard ""Kiss Kiss"" and realized that Stella Soleil had taken a song from the Turkish pop star Tarkan (called Spoiled) and ruined it. The English version is taken out of context with the music and the song should only be performed in Turkish to begin with. Thumbs down for this album."
2,Stella Soleil = ONE HIT WONDER,"Stella has a nice voice, but...there is only three good songs on the album. And they are ""Kiss Kiss"" [...], ""Pretty Young Thing"" and ""Stand Up."" Other than than...downtempo is too fast!!"
1,A Cheap Rip-Off!!,"This album is terrible. I cannot believe how Stella Soleil butchered such a wonderful song like Simarik and turned into a piece of trash like ""Kiss Kiss."" The original was so great, now it is just laughable. Buy the album Tarkan, by Tarkan instead; not only will you get the great song Simarik, but you will also have many other excellent songs on the album. Naturally they are not in English, they are in Turkish, but they are still great and you can understand all of the emotion in each one. That is the important thing. And Dirty Little Secret certainly has no emotion whatsoever."
1,don't waste your money on this cd,"this cd content and cd cover is a very poor attempt of trying to make a hit. the turkish version of her single kiss kiss is a huge hit in europe and she is trying to ride off of someone else's success. i would give her credit is she did a good job at the remake, but her version is so bad! the other songs sound like 80's pop, there is nothing interesting about this cd. she could afford to take a few vocal lessons. don't waste you time and money on this one. wasn't she part of an unsuccessful grouip prior to this one?"
3,"GOOD ALBUM, GOOD SONGS, BUT VOICE NEEDS WORK","Stella Soleils album ""Dirty Little Secret"" is a good album. ""Kiss Kiss"" the single off the album is very reminiscent to Siouxsie & the Banshees with style and vocals, however Stellas voice needs some lessons.Her voice tends to grate on you after a few songs. However the album is a good piece of pop with songs like ""Runaway Crush"", ""Twilight"", ""Angel Face"" and ""Love You to Death"".Just don't expect a masterpiece here. I think overtime Stella Soleil can improve on her vocals i.e. Madonna has over her 18 year pop music career. The songs are strong and probably can and will carry her to success. Already getting video play with ""Kiss Kiss"" on VH-1 and MTV, and already getting radio airplay ranking currently at no.18 at 95.7 in Boston, she could be on her way."
3,tracks 4-9 make this cd dull.....,"Stella may have a remarkable voice, kind of a resemblence, what Britney may sound like when she is 30. However, the music on this cd isn't all up to par. I liked ""Kiss Kiss"" till radio played the hell out of it. The first good song on the cd in my opinion is track 2, ""Pretty Young Thing"", and then track 3, the heartfilled ballad simply titled ""You"" is amazing from start to finish, its so calm and pure...then the cd starts to not be so good anymore. Through tracks 4-9, I didn't find a single song that I liked. Track 10 ""Look My Way"" comes up and the cd is good again for about 4 minutes, this one reminds me of Belinda Carlisle in the 80's, and then the last song ""Dance With Me"" which shares a similar beat to that of ""Unpretty"" by TLC is an excellent track.so unless you want a boring cd that you only like 5 or so out of 12 songs, then its probably not for you."
2,(2-1/2 stars) I'm trying to remember why I bought this,"Though she may not be remembered, Stella Soleil came out in 2001 with the album Dirty Little Secret. I don't think this album did much for two main reasons: the music is far from accessible, and Stella comes off as a poor man's Cyndi Lauper.I don't think anyone can honestly sit through this album without wondering what in God's name is going on here. To be perfectly frank, this album is embarrassing. The lyrics tend to be sleazy, cheesy, AND watered-down, which is pretty obvious with titles like ""Love You To Death"" and ""Let's Just Go To Bed"". Also, the production on this album leaves nothing to the imagination, because many of the songs on the second half on the album sound like carbon copies of songs on the first half.""Dance With Me"" is aiight and ""Kiss Kiss"" is tolerable, but they're not standout tracks or anything. There's no such thing on this album. In short, Stella Soleil gives new meaning to the word ""uncanny""."
2,i miss the ol' stella,"apparently peoples don't know much about stella's earlier work in a band called sister soleil. her lyrics there were more honest and threatening, desperate and angry -- and meanwhile a sweet glimmer of hope and thirst for peace. ANYWAY -- the music was alot more intense and stella's voice absolutely shimmered. but alas! something has happened to her and while she makes creative use of guitars and plays her voice wonderfully -- i can't stand this candypop plane she's built herself onto. i applaud stella for her work nontheless, she's a great artist with intense attitude and an honest heart. but her music this time around is a bit lame."
2,very disappointing,"I thought all the tracks would be like the first dance single, Kiss Kiss. I was wrong. Most of the songs are not even upbeat. Soleil has a nice voice, but the songs are boring. Buy this if you have trouble sleeping."
4,Kiss Kiss...,"For a her ""solo debut"" you'd think she'd release something original. ""Kiss Kiss"" is a nice re-working of the better known turkish hit sung by Tarkan (which is on his USA released album). Her voice is very nice. The music is solid, but nothing special. I hope she'll move more into her own style on her next release. She needs to leave the Madonna/Britney style behind for something alittle harder. Still... it is a good album."
5,Stella needs better reviews,"I was watching MTV2 and I see this video ""Kiss Kiss."" I'll say I was blown away. I wanted to get her CD but I didn't have time to write down the name of the singer. So I kept popping up on MTV2 to see the video ""Kiss Kiss"" and write down the singer's name. Finally I jutted down ""Stella Soleil."" When I found her CD I was debating about actually buying it because I've only heard that one song. Well, since was the only CD I ever found in the store and I was afraid I won't run into it again I bought the CD. When I got home the first thing I did was listen to the CD. And I'll say it is a great CD."
5,BEST CD OF 84,"This cd has such magical qualities that it consumes the soul and leaves it shimmering after a listen. The passionate guitar playing, the layers of keyboards painted on by the lovely strings, the passionate drumming, the soulful singing of Ian -- all together make this the music that every other band should be measured by. Additionally, buy this and Porcupine now -- your life will not be the same."
5,Much more here than meets the ear,"I never was much of a ""new wave"" fan, but this one really blew me away. Right through the wall. They really had something special here, a powerful world of its own that wouldn't be denied. Repeated visits were absolutely mandatory. They were necessary for fine tuning certain corners of my brain I didn't know existed. It reminds me of lesser known '60s psychedelic classics like ""Forever Changes"" and ""Songs for a Tailor."" It is deeply detailed and romantic but always hip, miles ahead of anything The Cure ever did or for that matter U2. In fact, I wouldn't trade this record for the entire U2 catalog. The U2 type of humorless melancholy is so boring and lethargic while the wacko-grim atmosphere on ""Ocean Rain"" is paradoxically uplifting and invigorating."
5,An rare album of staggering godlike genius.,"On this album the Bunnymen were possessed with something they would never recaputure. They never came close to equalling it, before or after. Somehow these mostly warm, lush, melodic songs emerged barely a year after the cold, caustic claustrophobia of 'Porcupine'. This is an impeccably paced set of songs that truly works as an album, from beginning to end. It sounds as original and fresh today as it did in 1984: flitting between the bright, shimmering pop of Silver and Crystal Days, and the brooding majesty of The Killing Moon and Ocean Rain itself. I've never known what the hell McCulloch is on about, but it hardly matters here. Everything flows. Even the weakest link, Noctural Me, has its place. Broad, sweeping, majestic. One of the half dozen finest albums ever made. It's that good."
3,Silly Rabbits!,"The singers an egomaniac and the band are just OK. Actually it's a pretty good record, their best, BUT IT AND THE BAND AS A WHOLE ARE ABOUT HALF AS GOOD AS THE UK BAND FELT. FELT IS THE TRUE GENIUS OF BRITISH 80's PSYCHEDELIC ROCK!!!"
1,Not very good,"Musical taste is subjective. But I think the worthlessness of this CD transcends the relativity of individual taste.I bought this CD because of positive customer reviews and comparisons to the Moody Blues. I like Moody Blues music. I disliked this CD. How to characterize my dislike ? You know when you have chewed a piece of gum for a long time, and it loses it flavor, but you have no place to put it, so you chew it for longer and longer, even though it has no flavor ? That is what listening to this music is like.It has become a joke where I work. When ever I attempt to put in a new CD, the secretaries give me a mock glare and say ""That's not Echo and the Bunnymen, is it ?""Bad."
2,Whatever..,"As an eighties child myself, Killing Moon, Bedbugs and Ballyhoo along with a few others have a very special place in my heart. So I thought I'd venture out a little and see if there was anything else I overlooked from their era.NOPE. I had not, and this was a waste of money."
3,three and a half stars,"Echo slowed down on this album and that disappointed me. There's also a string section, which lends it a somewhat commercial quality. Part of what made (and makes) Echo & the Bunnymen so appealling is that they created such brilliant, dense soundscapes almost solely with the traditional rock line-up of bass, guitar, drum and vocals. That's not the case on Ocean Rain.The ordinary thing for me to say at this point is probably: ""It's a good album, but not it's not where you should start"". On the contrary, however, I think you SHOULD buy this album first if you haven't heard Echo & the Bunnymen yet- you'll probably like it, but THEN buy Crocodiles, Heaven Up Here, and Porcupines, and see how much better those albums are even yet.... and you'll agree that the promotional claim that circulated when Ocean Rain was released, ""Greatest Album in the World"", was way over the top....."
5,been doing exercises for years and they changed my life,"I have various problems: a bad upper back, minor arthritis in the knee. Years ago, I started ""freezing up"" from muscle tension and the inactivity that came from being immobile. I discovered this book and have been applying it to myself ever since. I haven't had any contact with her organization lately, but back then, they sold a curved piece of metal with rubber tips on each end called a ""shepherds crook."" I have been using it on my own back ever since. The technique combines pressing on points of the various muscles for 5 seconds or so, along with stretching exercise. It works."
2,Pain Erasure,"The ad rated this book as Like New, but condition was not nearly as good as described. More like Acceptable (marginally). However, the content was certainly not adversely affected. With its info, I was able to alleviate chronic back pain in three days!"
5,Good Story,"I like this book because it shows that Jo would do anything to make sure that her sisters won't be adopted by her aunt but instead have herself adopted by her aunt because she thought that her sisters won't mind that. But instead she learns that her sisters do care about her and that she shouldn't ""jump to conclusions""."
2,Rather dull.,This book was rather dull. It was kind of boring and the plot was dumb. This series tells about the Little Women sisters when they were 10 years old. BETH'S STORY was better. Amy and Meg were too.
2,Give me a break!,"I am a huge fan of Louisa May Alcott and have probably read Little Women ten times. In all fairness, I have not read this book, but how can anyone think that they can successfully get a spin-off out of one of the most beloved stories of all time? And, might I add, a very important detail that this book glosses over from the outset-- Jo was supposed to be plain and even awkward looking, not beautiful and glamorous like the girl on the cover."
5,Incredible book - can't recommend it enough!,"After just getting out of a long-term relationship and being devestated by it, I picked up this book and boy has it helped! It is thorough and concise without getting wordy or technical. An absolute must for those whose hearts have been crushed - helps you to recognize and get through all of the stages of a breakup a little easier."
1,$46-$50? Seriously?,I just bought a slip on amazon.com for less than $30 - I will buy another of those slips and cut it off to use as a camisole before I spend almost twice as much for 1/2 the material and labor.
2,Never Holds Your Attention,"This album is mainly held together by okay tracks. There aren't really any highlights, just different shades of lowlights. The problem is some of the ryhmes don't make sense, such as claiming that rappers that came out well before her stole her style, she spends way to much time trying to attack other female rappers that are out of her league (Foxy Brown and Lil' Kim), and brags about having a life style, and reputation that she hasn't built. Her flow is tight at times, but her ryhmes never seem to hit there marks. There are a couple tracks that may get your attention, but none that hold it."
2,This album is ok,"She can rap, but the songs are boring. Maybe it is because I do not like her. She tried to diss my girl Foxy Brown on this album subliminally. I mean if she is so hardcore why diss someone subliminally. Queen Pen is very fake. She could rap. Instead of dissing Foxy and Kim, she need to be more concerned about her and her career because her album sales are low."
1,"QP? It's time for u to retire, u know end your career","Queen Pen's new album ""Conversations with queen"" is another album just thrown out there trying to grab your money. Don't fall for her imitations. Her fisrt single ""I Got Cha"" was wack. The video is wack, her lyrics are wack and she's definitely wack. She comes back form 97 now in the 2000 claiming she's the badest in the streets (lol) and she owned and started all the styles before anybody else. This album is a waste. I agree with CHRIS FILIPEE A 100%. Queen P better get her mind straight. Think before buying this album, your money isn't worth this garbadge. You should spend it on real albums from real artists like Eve, Foxy Brown and Trina."
1,Conversations with Queen,"Her debut was probably the worst female rap album of all time, so why she decided to put out a sophomore album just boggles my mind. Despite the fact that her 1999 debut My Melody went gold, Queen is an atrocious rapper. Her insane jealously twards rap's leading ladies Lil Kim & Foxy Brown is repetative and annoying and the fact that she claim's they stole her style when she came in the game 4 years after them is pathetic.Despite strong guest appearences by Prodigy, Amil & Cam'ron and some tight production from DJ Clue, this is the most disgusting and humiliating garbage to ever be released by a woman in the industry. No wonder this never cracked the top 200."
3,change conversation,"okay pen comes clean, but if you did'nt want nobody thinking you are a lesbian don't make songs about i had your girlfriend, you still act like a lesbian saying yopur best friend is gay, yes she is sexy, but you did'nt pioneer that style you talking about sure you had drama but every black woman catches hell in america, so you met tr, so you diss females who you say copied you so, not the best cd, and not the worst."
3,Plastic scoops could be better,"I purchased these plastic scoops to go in some of my dry goods containers (sugar, flour, etc). The largest scoop is useful, but the other two are way too small to be of any real use. I literally laughed out loud when I opened these and saw how small the smallest scoop is! It can't be much more than 2 inches long, handle and all! If you're looking for normally sized scoops, I say look elsewhere."
4,Little Scoopers,"The little scooper is useful for sugar, coffee, loose tea leaves, protien powder and smoothie powders. I wish they sold a set of the just the small scoopers because I have more items that need that little size than the bigger ones."
2,cheap,I didn't relize this was a set I had already had if I knew it wasthe same one I wouldn't have bought it at the price I paid.
5,The South and the Southerner,Life changing experience as I was so unaware of what was going on in the South even though I was in Southern California during the 50's & 60's. Got rid of some guilt feelings developed and better understanding of my not speaking out in the 70's and 80's in Atlanta. Wonderful book.
2,"OK, but don't like the closing","I used to have a pouch similar to this, but could not find it when I got my Canon XSi Rebel a month or so ago. I definitely wanted something like this again because my old one was fantastic - just couldn't find it or remember the brand.While I'm sure this would protect your camera and lens just fine - it's good thick neoprene - I don't like the way it closes. There are 2 snaps that you have to attach on the back/bottom of the camera every time you want to close it and that's just too time consuming. I returned it.I'll be getting a Zing - which is the neoprene pouch like I had before. They are very similar, but attach either with a loop that hooks over the lens, or with velcro. Makes it much easier to put on or take off the pouch."
3,Twas Ok,"I didn't actually have to pay for this album, my brother burnt me a copy, but the fact is... it was a bit of a disapointment. I liked the first song... and I know I liked some others as well... but I thought that it strayed a bit too much from what I loved. But hey, I don't really mind, I'm glad he's trying something new, and I hope for something I like much more from his next album."
