2,Does not handle 150 watts,"This is a small inverter. It will not power my 15 inch laptop. It will only charge it at best. The USB would not charge my IPOD. It would not work on the airplane. The green light showed it had power to it, and showed it was charging my laptop, but after 2 hours of charging, there was no differnce in battery level.In conclusion, I think it is good for charging light load electronics (cell phones) but considering my laptop draws 75 watts and it would not even power that, I think it is nowwhere near 150 watts capable."
1,power converter does not work,"I purchased the cobra converter at an airport electronic accessory store. It shorted out 2 DC cigarette lighters in two separate cars and although the box lights up, it will not charge my computer. The electronic stores refuse to take it back (no longer than 30 days) and I paid a lot more for it than the price offered here. Bottom line, it could present problems and is a faulty product. I am going to try to write to the company to get a replacement or my money back. Highly doubt it will happen, but worth a try."
2,Short-lived,"I bought this power inverter for my dad for Christmas. It works great, handles the advertised load, isn't too noisy, etc. The problem is that now, in mid-July (i.e., less than 7 months of light use), the fan circuit has burned out and rendered the device unusable. It's a shame, because it was great while it lasted.By contrast, I have a Duracell one that has been working for a year and a half now with no problems whatsoever. Should have bought another one of those."
4,Very useful and convenient,So far have only used in cars. Very quiet and had no problem supporting my T61s labtop. Need to be careful when plug and unplug the adapter for car use since the pins are pretty small.
4,"Perfect, except it's noisy","The product is great overall. Incredibly small for inverters (will be perfect for flying with my laptop), the power is not underrated, and the pouch it comes in is very handy.The only downside is that it is noisy. I've heard noisier inverters, but this thing is far from silent. I can hear the cooling fan distinctly over my car's engine and road nice (and I have a pretty loud car).Overall - still happy with the product. I needed an inexpensive, compact power inverter that can be used in a car and on a plane."
5,Cobra Power Inverter,"Pros: replaceable 20A fuse, USB port, quiet, case included, cig lighter plug or airline plug.Cons: Cord could be longer, additional USB port would be nice too.Conclusion: Works great in the car for long trips just remember to keep it ventilated."
1,Terrible,"I bought it to use both in cars and planes, but it never worked! It keeps turning on and off. I've tried to use it in three different cars and in several planes, but it never worked. Terrible product! Don't waste your money!"
2,Flawed fan circuit.,"I purchased this inverter to replace a Radio Shack unit that had failed after a great deal of heavy use. Now, this unit (like many others) has a circuit that is intended to enable the fan to run slower under light loads and faster under heavy use. Upon using this product, I discovered a flaw where under load close to the output capacity (140 watts, in my case) the fan in the unit will shut off. Rather than mess with sending it back, I just opened it up and bypassed the fan controller circuit and it now works fine, although somewhat noisy."
3,Typical for a B movie,The description of the movie on Amazon's website is accurate so there isn't any reason to reiterate it here. The movie was just ok. It's not one that I would want to watch again so I wouldn't suggest purchasing it. Rent it first to make the decision whether to buy. The acting is poor. I liked Eric Roberts in his early acting years such as in The Coca Cola Kid. It's a shame his acting in this movie is so bad. For a sci-fi horror movie it is at times funny. Not sure if it was meant to be or not.Not one of the better sci-fi movies I've ever seen. If you have nothing better to do some would agree it was worth seeing it once.
3,Half shark... half octopus... all killer!!!,This isn't the best movie Roger Corman has made but it was a lot of fun. I liked Dinoshark better because it was a little more serious; this film is cheesier. A giant shark octopus hybrid made for the Navy is released into California and travels down to Puerta Vallarta feeding on helpless victims. Acting isn't too bad and the CGI is okay. I have to give this film credit because it led me to meet Mr. Corman himself at a DVD signing of this film. It was anounced at this signing that not only is Dinoshark being released on DVD but also Dinocroc vs. Supergator. I sure hope Supergator and Dinocroc will be released on DVD. I'm also excited for the relaese of Corman's soon to come Piranhaconda.
3,A Gillty Pleasure,"If any of you have ever wondered what Jaws would have been like if it would have been a comedy, than look no further than the schlockfest Sharktopus. Sharktopus is a creature-feature that is silly, bloody, and had me laughing at several points during the film. Whether or not those laughs were intended is beyond me. Even though it is mildly enjoyable, Sharktopus is no Piranha. It's just another Sci-Fi channel original, only funnier than most."
3,It's so bad that it's kinda good!!!,"I watched this on tv a few days ago, and it was actually not too bad. It is very cheesy, and has incredibly fake cgi, but it also has pretty cool gory death scenes. A group known as Blue Water is trying to genetically engineer a half-shark, half-octopus for combat. It escapes and makes its way toward Puerto Vallarta. They hire Andy Flynn to stop it before it's too late. I'd probably recommend SHARKTOPUS!!!"
1,Sharktopus,"The military has created a half-shark, half-octopus hybrid but during a routine test it escapes and goes on a killing spree. I don't know how or why these giant mutant animal movies became popular all of a sudden, because they all suck, this one included. The story is garbage, just rehashes of rehashes, completely clich√© and all done before, and done better. The CGI is bad, but in all honesty, I have seen a lot worse from the Sci-Fi channel. The acting is bad, the pace is unbearably slow and it's just an all around terrible movie. It would pain me, physically pain me to have to watch this again. I like Roger Corman, and he's better than this. He's made cheese in the past but it was very entertaining, this just takes itself way too seriously and has nothing going for it."
2,DUMB,"My nephew likes this stuff so this is why i got it, But the wife said he wanted it so auntie got it for him"
3,it isn't my favorite mutant monster movie but it's ok,"This isn't my favorite mutant monster movie but it is OK for what it is....Yes, the acting is really bad. Eric Roberts' acting was bad and he is normally a pretty good actor. The girl who played his daughter was horrible. She really needs to take acting lessons. The guy wasn't much better. Actually, Pez, the skipper tracking the sharktopus was my favorite character. I just wished his white VW bug had not met its end at the tentacles of the sharktopus....it was such a cute VW bug! So all the acting was either horrible or they overacted. The pacing was somewhat slow in areas and I really got tired of watching the horrible flirting between the two main characters...it was painful to watch. I did enjoy watching the CGI sharktopus. It is cheesey but funny to watch him walk around on his tentacles."
2,"Over the top, even for Corman.","This made-for-TV/Direct to DVD movie must be seen to be believed. I'm a fan of low budget, shlocky horror movies, of the kind Corman is famous for, but this waste of time was too much even for me. Maybe it was the cheesy digital effects, because bad acting and bad writing have never prevented me from enjoying any Corman's older films, as well as gems by Ed Wood, Bert I. Gordon, William Castle, etc. When you start rooting for the creature to win, you know it's a bad film. Many shots had backlighting problems so bad that the actors were in silouette and you couldn't see their faces- even Ed Wood didn't make mistakes like that.89 minutes of my life I'll never get back."
2,"A terrible movie, but not in the good way you were hoping","This movie is crap. It's not worth watching not even for the cheese factor. The first half hour is very funny, however, after that the movie starts trying to take itself seriously and then it nosedives. Yes there are pretty girls in bikinis, yes there is some deliciiously awful acting, but after awhile these things just aren't enough to carry a movie. They certainly weren't enough to carry this one. A friend of a friend described it as a bad porn with no sex and this seems to be an apt description. Rent it if you must."
3,Wow... Just Wow.,"There were... Like two lovely moments in this movie. There were blood-splatters-effects on the ""camera"" at least five times. I think a couple of lines were even delivered passably, so... you know, pretty awesome.Honestly, if you see a title like, ""sharktopus"" and think it might be a good idea, then you're right. If you don't think it's a good idea, you're also right.P.S. Lots of bikinis, so that wasn't bad."
4,I don't care what they say. This is a great film.,I immensely enjoyed this movie. All my friends also enjoyed it. I love the way the beast look and acted. This will be a film I watch over and over again.
5,Sharktopus,Our grandson was thrilled with it so we were happy. Seemed to be good quality and lived up to expectations.
2,"Idea good, movie not so good","I enjoy a good B rated movie here and there but this one not living to hipes! I really like the idea behind it, but the concent really bad. Graphics are ok to a joke, I don't where why these B rated movies are following suits. Come on Movie Farkin Fish a B rated movie but its awsome movie! Actors, ok, personally so so. Watch at your own risk. Its that week."
5,is it a shark....is it a octopuss,a must see thriller with top notch cgi. tell your friends....tell your neighbors....just dont go swimmingrivals Jaws in every way
2,Good for a few laughs,"This movie has caused quite a bit of stir amongst the community of bad movie lovers. I think when the producers are well aware they are making a piece of crap, it is never as much fun to watch. Sharktopus has a few laughs, mostly centered around the cheesiest effects this side of the Tillamook factory tour (take it if you are ever visit the Oregon coast).Basically a genetically engineered sea beast is accidentally sent loose and goes on a killing spree. It's an hour and half only, and if really bad sci-fi movies are your thing you will probably like it. Or if you are a huge Eric Roberts fan I guess, as he is on hand for the ""fun."" I think teens will get a kick out of Sharktopus - especially boys, with all the bikini clad bimbos on display - and this movie is sure to become a slumber party classic."
3,Thumbs up for the Sharktopus. Thumbs down for the humans.,"Sharktopus was first broadcast on the SyFy network. It's better than lots of other made for SyFy movies but that's not saying much.Sharktopus looks great and whenever it's on the screen the movie is super fun to watch. (the tentacles are squid and the sound it makes is a whale but what's the point of nitpicking?) When Sharktopus is not on the screen, the movie is a bit of a bore. None of the humans are very interesting.There are the required scantly clad women but no nudity or serious cursing. As long as the kids can deal with a few decapitations and fake blood this movie makes for a night of family fun."
1,You're kidding right?,I would give this a negative score if available. It just blows my mind that crap like this is given the BluRay treatment and classics like Ben Hur are ignored. A must have for those with a sub-60 IQ. Pathetic.
3,The title says it all!,"If you're going into this movie expecting great acting, awesome special effects, a solid plot line or anything along those lines then you are sure to be disappointed.However, if you are looking for a B horror movie then this fits the bill perfectly. I got this movie expecting it to be a stupid movie about a shark/octopus hybrid killing machine and I got exactly what I anticipated. It's a little bit funny, a little bit bloody and a lotta bit cheesy.In summary, movie snobs stay away. B movie afficianados it's worth a gander."
2,"In the Land of Bad Movies, This Movie is King!","Wow...what a stinker! I thought the campiness of this would make it fun, but I was mistaken. It's just bad. This is the basic storyline of ""Armagedden"", just with a giant military engineered ""sharkoctopus"". There are no words to describe just how mundanely bad this movie is. I predicted virtually every single line uttered by the characters. If I want to watch a truly entertaining bad movie, I'll stick with Ed Wood, or at least Mystery Science Theater 3000 reruns. Now THAT'S entertainment. Still bad movies, but the difference is that you can laugh at them instead of groaning. THIS movie is a groaner."
1,Awful,"This film is the steaming pile of garbage you expect it to be. From a technical standpoint, it actually made me cringe throughout. EVERYTHING is horrid, not just the acting and story/script. It's all bad: cinematography, editing (jump-cuts galore, and who approved that awful DVE phone con sequence!?), VFX (compositing was dreadful), etc. Just terrible. If you are looking for a movie to ""MST3K"" then this may be it. If you are looking for something watchable, this isn't it."
3,"Truly terrible, but kind of fun","As far as a movie goes, this really should get 1 star. There are all sorts of problems, from overacting, underacting, special effects, writing... But this is SHARKTOPUS! It's supposed to be horrible! As long as it's fun, horrible is OK. Sometimes horrible is great, likePiranha [Blu-ray], which knows it's supposed to be a horrible and is gleeful about it. That movie is more of an homage to grade Z creature features, and it's a well done homage.Sharktopus? Well my one real problem with it is that it seems to be a little slow. Everything that happens is just a beat too late. This movie should be gleefully terrible, but it doesn't move along fast enough to hint at that evil grin and diabolical laughter coming from the director's chair between takes. For a movie like this, almost everything can tank, but the editing needs to be spot on.So it gets three stars - it's so bad, it's watchable."
4,would buy again,"I looked around computer speakers. I was gonna try to stay with JBL. After about 2 months of reading reviews and ckecking out demos i went with the encounters. My girlfriend has the ""JBL creatures"" I liked those too but i thought over all sound with with these encounters Now your not gonna shake the floor or knock pictures off the walls. But for computer speakers they really throw out some sound. The only reason why i didnt rate this with 5 stars is that when you have them all the way up, the sub does fine but i think is steals power from the left and right. I wanna say that when i put my ear close the speaker i can hear volume drop...In all honesty ive only maxed it out three times. ide buy them again"
1,Cheap Plastic Housngs Rattle & Buzz,"These are truly a shame because the speakers seem to be of good quality, but JBL put them in cheap, hard plastic housings that rattle and buzz, even at low to moderate volume.GET THE KLIPSCH 2.1 PROMEDIA SYSTEM FOR OUTRAGEOUS POWER AND QUALITY!!!!!"
3,Good,"Stereo Total (To-tAl) definitely have their references in check. This band is exists on 1960s French Film music, Serge Gainsbourg, and probably about a thousand others I don't know about. There is even an extremely electrically souped up version of the Beatles ""Drive My Car.""And electronic soup is the order of the day for Stereo Total. This music processed to the hilt through filters, modern drum machines, and vocal flangers. You will never mistake any of this for the genuine 60s article.Overall, this is a lot of fun: but Stereo Total are not as inventive, as say Stereolab or the High Llamas. Total modernizes the recording process of their sources, but are not interested in composing suites or adding fresh ideas.All of which is just fine if you are not looking for the invention of Lab or Llamas. Taking a little trip with Stereo Total may be light, but you gotta enjoy the breeze, sometimes"
3,Not half bad...,"Although this album is by No means flawless, it certainly has it's moments. 'I love you,ono' and the cover of Pizzicato Fives'Mon Amour Tokyo' are by far the two best tracks on the album. Sloppy at times, but if yo're a fan of french music, give it a try!"
1,Not as advertised,"While the 'Fast Wipes' themselves, work great, this is NOT a pack of 4 buckets, with 130 wipes per bucket, it is ONE bucket of 130 wipes, or 1/4 of what was advertised.I was going to send them back, but after more research, the price is not that far out of line for a bucket, so it isn't worth the hassle to me, it is just not what they advertised it to be."
5,Good basic summaries and management guidelines- A NP Bible,My copy is used constantly for review. I update in margins since this is a 1997 copy and some changes in management have occurred. It is still a good reference Bible that I use daily.
2,FNP guidelines- fenstermacher,"HEENT, in particular, leaves something to be desired. Not as straight foward as similar publications. Not comprehensive enough. Pricey."
1,Parental Warning,"I also made the mistake of judging a book by its cover and buying this book for my fourth grade daughter at the Scholastic Bookfair.Do you want your daughter to read about a girl whose parents divorced when she was ten and writes ""my method for dealing with depression was a razor blade and a locked bedroom door"". This story called ""Sleep-Away Camp"" deals with self-mutilation.Your child can read about a four-year old girl and her sister getting felt ""in places that aren't meant to be seen by other people."" How about a suicide story? How about a mother with flesh-eating disease? Or the deaths of best friends, fathers, or the death of a mother by mixed meds? It is all in this book. Of course, the authors also include anorexia and a mixed bag of other dysfunctional behaviors. Not quite so heart-warming as it is disturbing. I definitely feel I was misled by the title and cover presentation. This book needs a ""young adult"" rating."
5,good,it was good. i really liked it. i read it for silent reading at school. i read it over and over. i am only 11.
3,"good, but there was one bad story...","the book was good, and i reccomend it, but one story turned me off. i am 11, and i was, um, disturbed by one girl who french kissed a boy at my age. it wasn't chicken soup, it was ACID SOUP.for your sake please skip a bite of all right. it made me feel like... poop.:p"
5,A Tweens Review,"I have heard so many great things about this book and very few that were bad comments. Many girls are really experiencing these things like getting bras for instance. I read a very funny chapter about a girl who needs a bra but is not at all wanting one and she thinks she needs a training bra but really needs an A cup! I would recommend this book for kids 10 and up because it has some parts that wouldn't be appropriate for kids 9, 8, 7 etc. They are REAL stories about REAL girls that REALLY happened! I recommend that you have you parents read about the parts about stuff like suicide and stuff like that. I love the book so far and even though I'm not done with it I am enjoying it very much! I hope this reveiw was helpful!"
4,This book is great!,Chicken soup made me both laugh and cry.I think it is a really great book for preteen girls.It showed me that other girls are going through the things I am going through.
5,The best solution for breastfeeding in public,"I love thi sling for many reasons but the top three are the following:1) my baby calms down right away when she's carried in it.2) she doesn't get scared of strangers when we visit new people or go to a party (she's in the middle of the stranger anxiety phase).3) Most of all it helps nursing really discretely in public without ovrheating my baby. Before Itried to use all kinds of blankets and scarves but my baby was getting so swaty and hot. instead the fabric of maya wraps is very breathable and my baby remains at a comfortable temperature, even in Texas."
2,second best,"I have both the maya wrap and the moby wrap, and all i have to say is that the people who love the maya wrap are the ones who have not yet tried a moby wrap. the moby wrap is better hands down. it holds my baby MUCH more secure than the maya and i can hold her in many more position. the moby supports on both shoulders unlike the maya and i would recommend the moby without a doubt to people. so if you read this and you're trying to decide between the two, GET THE MOBY!"
2,I Don't Like It,"I've used this wrap for five months now and the only thing that I like about it is the tail because I can nurse while carrying my baby with ease. I don't like the fabric and when tightened it digs into my neck and my baby's legs and hurts. It seems to be twisted 90% of the time and I know that I'm threading it correctly. I have to readjust it too often because the fabric is always sliding and loosening up the sling. I NEVER go hands free using this carrier. I don't know what they're talking about but this sling isn't that secure. Another thing about slings is they are only supported by one shoulder and your back so eventually the weight from any sized baby causes a lot of pain and discomfort. I am looking into the Moby or Sleepy Baby wraps because they're softer, more secure and distribute weight evenly, but I'm not sure if I want to be bothered with all that wrapping."
2,hate it,I tried the Maya Wrap for about 1 month then returned it. I couldn't stand it. Even after watching the instructional video I had trouble getting the wrap just right. It always twisted on me and was so uncomfortable. I would spend 5 minutes in the parking lot everytime I was going to use it and it drove me crazy! I hate the Maya wrap and enjoyed using the simple Baby Bjorn much more.
4,Excellent First Impression!!,"I used it the first time today w/o watching video because I was so excited to use it. I think it was twisted and it wasn't very tight but it helped so much with the weight after watching the instructions I am even more excited to use it. My daughter is 15 months old 25 lbs. I'm used to carrying her all this time, but she loved the maya as much as I did, she was happy and calm in it. Will post more later! Get it! The moby you have to criss cross it twice around your body and it's 4-5 yards of fabric (12-15 feet). Imagine doing that in a parking lot!! haha! Maya rox!"
2,Not very imaginitive,"The connection between t;he main character's ability to imagine the lives of the desaparecidos and real history was never made, and therefore the story was simply weak."
2,If Stephen King had been born in South America....,I really feel hesitant about giving this movie a poor review because it's very well-made and everyone in it is excellent...but it doesn't work. I agree with the other review that criticizes the film for trivializing the sad horrors of South America by playing them out in a movie about a psychic. The 1982 film MISSING with Jack Lemmon and DEATH & THE MAIDEN with Sigourney Weaver touch on the same topic and do a better job of handling it.You almost feel guilty for watching a form of entertainment about a dark and despicable part of history.Watching IMAGINING ARGENTINA is kind of like watching THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION if that film had included numerous brutal prison gang rapes.
2,HYPE,"I've got the feeling this is 120% hype. I'm not doing it again. I think this is someone's ship come it, but not mine."
2,Does it work for weight loss?,"I couldn't really tell it it works or not for weight loss, but then I did not keep accurate track of my weight, LOL. I bought it because I read another review reporting loss of weight, so I was so curious that I tried it myself."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,There is nothing I like about this product.I would not recommend it to anyone - friend or foe.Sorry
1,Caveat Emptor,Through what appears to be a manufacturing defect - my copy of this CD wouldn't load into any of my CD players. I was bummed. I never had this problen before or since with any of hundreds of CDs.
5,Now Know the Words!,"Any fan of the MGM movie needs this collection of its many catchy tunes. The piano score is relatively easy, and the lyrics are overly-complete: they include introductions and entire songs, such as ""Jitterbug,"" that ended up being cut from the film. You'll never mumble in the middle of a ""Wizard"" song again!"
2,Too Little Coverage,"I really wish I could be more enthusiastic about this product - after all I have enjoyed most other books I have that have been published by IBM. However, I have to say that this tutorial barely scratches what one can do with VisualAge for Java. The author basically goes thru two simple applications. The first application shows how to display a duck in a pond, and the second one shows how to create a really simple spreadsheet. For 69 bucks, how about including serialization, jdbc, servlets, RMI? How about showing the real novice how to use the scrapbook? Go to IBM's website and download the tutorials - I bet you'll learn more."
4,Awesome!,This CD provided me with a lot of the information I needed in a no-nonsense manner. I was able to grasp the tips I needed to develop an application program in the VIsual Age IDE after using the CDROM only twice. I think it's one of the best information sources on the topic.
1,Quick overview at best,"This CD is not worth your money. It is basically a bunch of Lotus ScreenCam files strung together by a batch file. The batch file on my CD wasn't even written correctly, one of the files was out of order. If you by chance unfortunately decide to purchase this CD, copy the contents on your hard drive, it will run much smoother.The lesson content is basically just a quick step-by-step of building a program in Visual Age. It is not for beginner Java programmers. Your money is best spent elsewhere."
3,Don't Expect too much,I was hoping to get a lot more from this tutorial than what I got. It's too short and addresses only the AWT and Swing components vis-a-vis VA for Java. I would recommend this book for someone who is a real novice.
5,Not The New Wave Lennon And McCartney,"During the late 1970's or early 1980's, some hack came up with the bright idea of christening Difford and Tilbrook the ""new wave"" Lennon and McCartney, which I always found to be quite ridiculous since I was never the world's biggest Beatles fan. ""Argy Bargy"" showcases the band at the peak of their melodic genius before they hit big (sort of) with ""East Side Story."" Paul Carrack soon replaced a disenchanted Jools Holland and the rest, as they say, is history. The guitar solo on ""Wrong Side Of The Moon"" is exquisite. I saw them in 1981 at this converted disco called Nitro outside of Detroit and it was magical."
5,ARGY BARGY & LOTS MORE,"First of all-this was a great album when it came out-all great songs that flow together well-everyone knows PULLING MUSSELS-ANOTHER NAIL IN MY HEART & IF I DIDN'T LOVE YOU but there are other great songs as well-SEPERATE BEDS-MISADVENTURE-I THINK I'M GO GO-FARFISA BEAT-THERE AT THE TOP-the musicianship & songwriting is brilliant english pop-BUT THEN.....you get great bonus material(demos,outakes,B-sides&rarities)then you get a second cd of live songs from this era which sounds awsome! I saw them live 6x's in the early eighties(twice with this band line up)and it brings back great memories of the Dr. Pepper concerts on the pier in N.Y.City! This is a must have for any Sqeeze fan P.S. comes with a nice booklet too!"
4,Not bad!,"Has a faster,more danceable, and more poppy feel than Gran Hotel. Probably better to liven up a party with, but for everyday listening just doesn't have the brooding beauty & impact of Gran Hotel's tunes.Also, he sings more on this one, which is not a good thing and turned into a disaster in ""Amatoria""."
5,Aubele guitar + Clavier vocal = pleasure to listen,"Excellent delicate, natural music with perfect relaxing argentinian cafe atmosphere. It ask me to fly to Buenos Aires.Music: 5 of 5Aubele Guitar: 5 of 5Clavier, Sanchez, Varela vocal: 5 of 5Sonics/Sound/Recording: 3-4 of 5"
4,Great Stuff!,"I like TC, so I tried Federico. I loved his music on Buenos Aires and the sensual spanish female vocals, so I was a bit disappointed with his forray into vocals on this record. Still a lot of amazing stuff here. I mean he does a pretty good job singing, but Federico man, you cant match the sensual nature of the ladies that sing for you."
1,Not very friendly,I could only play this in my car. When I put it in my Mac and tried to download it to iTunes it caused iTunes to crash. It took me a couple of hours to fix my iTunes. All I wanted to do was load it on my iPod so I could take it with me. I don't know what caused it but I am not happy.
3,Good example of 20th century British classical music,"I heard one of the pieces from this CD on the local classical radio station and decided to buy this CD. After listening to it twice through, I can say the music is very typical of 20th century British classical. It is symphonic in nature, attempts to be grand in certain places, but lacks the rich melody and natural elegance of more famous works such as the Planets by Gustav Holst, or the Enigma Variations by Sir Edward Elgar. Overall, an OK album to listen to; neither great nor bad."
2,Not a 8 Quart Bowl,"I have a 6 quart bowl I use during the holidays and decided I needed a larger bowl for mixing. I ordered the Fox Run 8 Quart bowl expecting the to be a good size. I received the first one and it was exactly the size of my 6 quart bowl. I even poured water in to verify exactly 6 quarts. Sent it back thinking I was sent the wrong size bowl. Just received the replacement. Same 6 quart bowl. I don't care how you measure it, the bowl is 6 quarts. Guess this is like the 6.5 oz can of tuna that is now 5.5 oz. Everything has been down sized. Maybe Fox Run should advertise it as 6 quarts rather the misleading them."
2,Fox Rus Stainless Steel 8-Quart Mixing Bowl,First off - this bowl is not 8 quarts. I just got the bowl and the first thing I noticed was how small it was because I was expecting a 2 gallon bowl. I measured out liquid as I poured it into the bowl and it holds 1 gallon and a little over 4 cups (when full to the brim). I am returning it today. Other than that it is a very fine bowl and I would have loved to have kept it. It was a good weight and the quality was great for the price.
4,"For what it was worth, perfect","Pros:AffordableLarge (did not actually measure it as others did, but wasn't terribly interested in precision)Cons:Thin material (it WILL dent if you drop it considering the first one they sent me actually had a monstrous ding in it)For the cost and my general, non-professional, every-day use - it's perfect."
3,Cheap and inexpensive,This was an inexpensive bowl and it shows. It was easy to dent the metal because it is so thin. For how we intend to use it I don't anticipate this being a problem.
2,Fox Run 8 quart mixing bowl,"The bowl was very light-weight, thin and can bend very easily. It's large enough to hold a batch of air-popped corn."
2,A humerous representation of an Alien landing,"What would happen if a pair of chattering teeth came from one of the moons of Jupiter to inhabit a human corpse and wreak havoc on homosexual college students? I really didn't know until I saw this movie. If Mystery Science Theater took requests I would think that this movie would be perfect for them. Let me tell you this movie was so low budget that the dubbing was at least a fourth of a second off the whole way through. If it wasn't for the lack of dialouge, plot, good camera work, and dazzling special effects I would have given this movie five stars but it was funny and what else was I going to do for 48 minutes (I fast forwarded through most of it) so I decided to give it a 2. You should see it anyway though because then I'll know that someone else had to watch it too. We can't let great low budget movies vanish from the video archives. We can't let that happen!"
2,C.R.U.D.,"Universal heart-throb and international mega-star, Wink Roberts headlines this gripping tale of alien vengeance. Gangsters gun down an informant and dump his body in a nearby swamp (the world's cleanest). A meteorite splashes into the same swamp, causing the dead guy to rise from his watery grave, right next to the local college! Sounds like a murder rampage movie, right? Wrong! Although the zombified stooly has opportunities aplenty, he only kills the two rats who offed him. The college kids, hideously annoying as they are, are quite safe. George Goebel plays the college professor w/ near-lifelike precision. Watch for a very young, very cute Rita Wilson as Debbie. And don't forget Wink Roberts, in the days before his inate talents were fully recognised..."
3,"Nifty Components, Lacking in Real Technical Depth","""Flash MX Components Most Wanteed"" is targeted towards designers and those that shy away from ActionScript. The book focuses on explanations of how to use each of the components -- not how they were created or the design choices made while building these sometimes extraordinarily complex components. Many of the components contained on the CD are quite useful, but I personally could have done without the ""nifty graphics"" and image manipulation components. It's nice to have detailed explanations of each of the available component parameters (kind of like a product manual), but the book left me wanting more about the hows and whys of creating solid, useful Flash MX components."
4,Really good components,"I bought this book just because an especific component, but I found there a little bit more useful ones.You can see examples, explanations and variations about them in the book, wrote by their developers, and you could install the components you want (21 avaiable) from the CD. Some are really good!Thanks!Humberto Massareto"
3,disappointing,"Some of the readings in this issue are better than others, but overall, Granta #77 was a disappointment. The criticism that appears in this issue America is seldom critical enough--one pleasant exception, however, is in the short essay by Harold Pinter. Also very enjoyable was the short story--irrelavent to the theme--by Coatzee, ""Youth."" This story was a well-done analysis of, among other things, the human aspect of the corporate world. There are a couple dry but informative readings that are worthwhile, though, if you're not up on your goings on in the middle east."
2,This unit it HOT!,I run a few laptops during the day here for various reasons.No problems except the laptop generates so much HEAT.I called customer service this morning. They told me to change the bios settings to turn off the fan. Are you kidding me. The fan is the only thing keeping this computer from melting.This is no joke. I can keep my coffee warm by keeping the mug next to the vent.Be careful what you pay for. I would spend the extra $300 or so dollars the next time.
3,"Rent it, don't buy it.","First off, these skits are very funny. I laughed out loud over them, and was shocked at first to find that this DVD only has 3 stars on this site. But watch them more than twice, maybe three times, and they stop being funny. I used to love watching the ""Two Towers"" parody trailer, one of the funniest things I've ever seen, but even that represents some sort of fading appeal. Rent it from a rental chain without late fees (which does not include Blockbuster), watch them, and return it. They're hilarious, but they don't quite stand up to repeated viewing."
1,Horrible in every sense of the word!,"Mad TV sucks! The show features actors that could not make it on to SNL. The overall concept has nothing to do with Mad Magizine, they are just cashing in on the name for guarenteed veiwership. And the writing is hoorible! The writers can't think of anything funny so they just have the little Asian guy run around in his underwear.Please, for the love of mercy, think of something new!"
1,"best of mad tv 8,9,10","i'll never know,, as I never recieved it in the mail !!I think the mailman stole it !!"
3,Where is season 2?,"I love Mad TV but I've always been a fan of the earlier seasons and wonder what the deal is with releasing this set of later seasons first?Come on guys, bring out those other seasons!"
3,disappointed,I have always been a fan of MAD TV and were not thrilled to see bits and pieces. They do not sell the entire seasons which is very disappointing. I will not buy any more unless they put the entire season on video.
2,disappointed,I thought that this would have a lot more scenes I would like. I saw many of the shows in this season and I a m not sure how they selected these ones as the best of the season. It was not worth the money I paid for it. There were a few scenes I liked but not many
1,best of sucks,What ever happened to releasing full seasons on dvd. you release season one and thats it ? Until you start releasins full seasons I wont be buying this mish mash.
3,Not the seller's fault.,"DVD came in perfectly really. But I don't like how you get the supposedly ""best of the best"" skits and not full episodes. I'm sorry, I do not think Tank is funny. :/"
4,Fantastic!,I absolutely love MadTV! My husband and I spent the first couple months of our relationship laughing over Stuart videos. I wanted to relive those moments so I bought this set and I'm going to be giving it to him as a birthday gift this month. I'm really excited to see what all is on it!
2,Disappointing,"What a huge disappointment. The classic characters are represented, but who picked the sketches? Most of the sketches they picked aren't that funny.The extras are worthless bloopers and commentary. For example, one features Michael McDonnell saying ""in this scene I'm trying to make Mo Collins laugh."" Then they show the scene again. He says, ""now I'm trying harder."" Completely stupid."
2,Total Disappointment,"I've been a fan since the first season and this ""Best"" DVD was a total disappointment. It had a few enjoyable sketches but came off as being the best of the worst. Seasons 8, 9 and 10 must have been real stinkers (though I don't remember them as such) 'cause I could count the laughs on one hand. This compliation may have been someone's favorite bits (for some strange twisted reason)but definitely not the best. Good thing is was only 10 bucks."
5,Best of MAD TV,"I have been in love with MAD TV since I was younger. I was very happy with this purchase as all episodes they compiled are hilarious. I wish they made more like this, or had all seasons on DVD. I def. recommend this to MAD TV viewers."
4,Learning the Letters.,"This is an entertaining alphabet book that does more than help children learn the ABC's. It also helps in increasing their vocabulary and understanding of the world. The pictures in the book look like paper cut outs pasted upon the page. Each page is filled with lots of things that start with the letter of the page. For example everything from apples to armadillos to acorns are pictured and labeled on the ""A"" page. At the bottom of each page is a question and an illustration that can be answered by careful examining the items listed above. For example, on the ""D"" page the question is ""Why should Dog and Duck duck?"" (the answer is dynamite). Kids enjoy looking at this book and it's fun to read to children on a one-on-one basis."
3,white & little padding,My bad on the white color pick. Unfortunately these sketchers appear a little narrower than some of my other brands of shoes and a little less padding in the shoe sole.
1,Nothing more than a snowjob for his businesses,"I'm completely perplexed how this book is even being sold outside of the author's car trunk. This book is nothing more than one big advertisement for the author's other businesses (card decks), books, and personal mlm businesses. I thought I was getting generic information about success techniques within the industry, instead I got little more than a flyer that instructed me to join his mlms, buy his books and advertise in his card deck. The other ""filler"" information is a sad mixture of seemingly lifted phrases and themes from other, better texts and war stories detailing the author successfully brow-beating prospects or distributors."
1,Water inside turned black! Yuck!!,We've had these cars for about 3 months and the water in the shark car has turned completely black. No leakage - thankfully! My son is pretty hard on these toys.
1,It's a little leaky,These trains are very neat and my sons loved them when we first got them. They each have been through two sets with the same result...the water leaks out after you've had them awhile. They are not worth the money. I highly recommend investing in another train instead of the aquarium cars. This was the first time my guys have been disappointed with a Thomas product.
4,Thomas the Train Aquarium Cars,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my (almost) 3 year old grandson who loves all things connected with ""Thomas"" and knows them all by name. He is fascinated by the aqautic cars and their contents. Will play with them by the hours as he interacts and uses his imagination."
4,Cute,"Cute but not the most exciting. The light up cars are fun, but compared with some of the other pieces my nephew owns, this one doesn't rank as high in my opinion, but he enjoys playing with all of the different combinations of cars to create different scenarios."
4,Needs longer light up time,"Flaw: lights up for less than three seconds which is frustrating for kids. Fortunately, my daughter is thrilled with the idea of it and still plays with it. Matches nicely with Thomas train and we bought it to go with that."
3,Just to be clear - it's not a wood toy.,"Even thought he packaging touts that it's ""Real Wood,"" it's easily 90% plastic. I suspected as much, but hoped I'd be wrong. It's fine, and I'm sure my great-nephew will love it, but I'd have preferred to buy something a little less throwaway and better designed."
3,I purchased this book from Amazon,"""The whispers of angels"", was a slight disappointment. I really can't tell you what was missing, but 1 thing was it was not connected enough to God. Some of the incidence were not even outstanding. In other words, I just couldn't see or feel God on some of these happenings."
3,Sweet but,"But not may favorite. personal reflection on the things that help to make her who she is. It offers insight to her heart, but often connections she felt was not clearly or smoothly passed to the reader. I did pass it along to the nurse staff believing they might connect easier."
5,Great Party Game,I'm 24 years old. The songs in this game were fun to play cause I knew the majority of them. We invite our friends over to play. That or my little cousin play it. They were getting bored with dance dance revolution (which is also a great party game).It's fun for all ages. I have the wireless the guaitar as well. When I got ok with the game.. it was fun dancing circles around my boyfriend rockin' out to the game. I think everyone should grab this game. Fun times to be had by all!
5,Amazing,"I have yet to find someone who does not have fun playing this game. I know several people who have even been motivated to buy a PS2 just to play it. If you like rock music, even a little bit, you will love this game."
5,great job!,"its a great game and if you liked the first guitar hero, wow, your in for a suprise, with all new characters, outfits, venues, songs, and encores, i had a blast, didnt put it down for a week. and the great thing is, its not a game that u beat and thats it, ur done, unlike an adventure or shooting game u can keep playing it over and over! i love it"
5,Just when you thought you couldn't rock any harder...,"Guitar Hero 2 is the single most funnest game to play! Now with the Co-Op mode you can rock out with friends and try to rise to stardom while one plays lead guitar and the other plays bass! All new songs makes for hours and hours of non-stop hardcore rockin'! Get ready to feel the burn in your hands because you will not be able to put this game down, a definite must buy!!"
5,Best Game Ever,One of the best games to come out for playstation and xbox. Very easy to learn and quickly becomes addicting. It's great for one player or two people to play together. It's even great for groups of people to gather around and take turns playing. A Must Have!
5,Best Game ever!,"This is, in my opinion, one of the best game ever made. My friend had guitar hero 1 and i got addicted to it. So when guitar hero 2 came out and amazon had it on sale, i had to jump on it. It is similar to a guitar (notes are not similar) but the style of playing is close enough to the point where u have to move your hands around in order to play the right notes and have to strum at the the right time."
2,Rent before you buy if you played the original.,"What happened to the sound in this game? Heavy majority of the songs sound like they were recorded thru a wall. The sound is far inferior to the one provided in the original game. Whereas the original sound was clean, crisp and bold (especially in Godzilla), this game's sound is muffled significantly; game has numerous tracks that you can barely distinguish the guitar from the singer. No matter what I did to my stereo system, I could not get the game to sound right. Furthermore, what happened to quality of the covers? Some of these are absolutely bad; definitely below the quality produced by Harmonix in the first game. The only redeeming quality is that the song list is good and graphics are improved. Rent before you buy... overall I'm disappointed after paying full price. IF this was $20 game, the rating would be better."
2,warning to parents,"This is a fun game and includes some great songs but some of the songs are very worrisome. In my opinion the game deserves an M rating due to the material in a few of the selections. Even if the profanity in these songs has been removed the content is disturbing.Why choose bands like Danzig,Lamb of God (aka Burn the Priest) Megadeath, Rage Against the Machine and Avenged Sevenfold-when there are so many other, less extreme bands, to choose from? Check out the lyrics on the songs by these bands BEFORE you buy this...we returned ours. Otherwise a fun and challenging game."
2,Incompatible with 2nd party controllers,We have the original GH1 controller and a 2nd party controller. The second party controller works with GH1 but not GH2. Send RedOctane a note and they stated they don't test for second party compatibility. I think this is a bum rap that they force you to buy their controllers. Last RedOctane game I every buy. Take all you can from the customer. Bad on ya.
4,Guitar Hero II,I got the guitar hero III before any of the others and i liked it so i bought this one. I was excited at first but when i played it the graphics were horrible and the notes were harder to hit. I beat it on hard in about two hours and out of about twenty five songs i only liked about eight. It is like any other guitar hero becides the songs. Multiplayer on this is not the best but that is the only way to play on multiplayer. It is a good game but the graphics r horrible and there r not many good songs on it at all.
2,Poor graphics,If you've already played Guitar Hero III and just want some new songs don't bother. The graphics and sound quality are so disappointing that you'll quit half way through and go back to GHIII. There's no challenge at all. I don't even want to know what the original GH is like.
4,ok but needs newer songs!,Ok & fun to play but needs newer songs for modern POp radio & teenage kids
4,Guitar Hero II,The game is really fun and I love the songs. I like the changes they made from Guitar Hero to Guitar Hero II.
4,Nice improvement except for the songs...,"I love both the guitar heros! They make for a great party! The legend does live on, the songs are less favorable to me than the original guitar hero. I asked my brother what he thought and he likes the GH2 songs better. So all in all you'll like it but you'll like it more if you didn't like the first Guitar Hero."
3,Awesome but maybe not for little kids,"I'm 11 years old and my parents bought this for me. I think that this game is the best game you could buy,but I think that it should also include a better mix of music for all ages. I was a little shocked hearing some profanity in some of the songs. I would like to see this game with some christian music. But over all I could play this game all day."
5,Love This Game,This is my favorite game of all time. My son has it for the 360 and I got so little playtime I bought it for the PS2 so I could play it. Only disappointments were the graphics as compared to the 360 (to be expected) and no downloads (also to be expected). Also have GH3 for 360 and PS3 and GH2 is much better. GH3 has been disappointing in it's sound quality on both systems and 2 different HDTVs.
5,Comfort at your fingertips.....,"The Dickie's coveralls arrived in such a short time. Actually, a suprise, they arrived so soon after ordering. The quality is excellent, and my husband has worn Dickie's coveralls for every day wear for several years. He wouldn't buy any other. Dickie's coveralls are not available in stores in our area, so with a touch of your fingers, ( on line) you can have your hubby lounging in comfort within a very short time...."
1,wrong item sent,The wrong item was sent to me even though the shipping labell inside the packaging stated what I had ordered! I had to ship it back and still have not received the correct item and missed the opportunity to give the gift on time.
4,Worked for me,"These are comfortable, durable and hold up to repeated washings. What I don't like is there is no access to your pants pockets, nor are there zippers on the legs. Other than that, this is a great item for a great price."
2,sizes are estimates,"Dickies Men's Short Sleeve Coverall, Medium Blue, 2X Large-RegularOrdered same size as before but crotch was about 3 inches lower.Washed three times in hot water - not much help.Maybe made in different country caused the difference.Quality good: just sizing not dependable."
2,I like them if only,This product is cheep. The strings keep coming lose. I don't know It seems like some thing you could buy at walmart since it's so badly built.
5,Coverall,Very pleased with purchase. It reminds me of the coveralls my dad wore in the 70s. My son loves it.
3,Great Episodes...but a little expensive.,"Only buy this DVD box set if you LOVE Tales from the Crypt.You have to love it!Countless cameos by familiar faces.They actually put together a very shoddy faux Crypt Keeper to host the DVD Menus (I thought technology got better with time!)And yes, there is an episode directed by...Arnold Schwarzenegger!No, the Governator does not STAR in the episode.Ahh-nuld only directs it."
5,Best Horror Show Ever!,I was really happy when i first haerd about the first season and now i found out the second season is coming in less then 4 months. Why the make us wait just release them once a month or all at the same time. None the less hereaup!
4,Great Show!!,"I haven't seen a ""Tales From The Crypt,"" episode since I was a kid, it was great to see them in all their complete glory on amazon. What a great deal."
5,so happy....,i really enjoyed the tales from the crypt series...so i plan on buying more seasons....so happy with my purchase. i recommend to everyone to buy from amazon...you won't be disappointed!
5,early Springsteen classic,"This double CD has some great early-period Springsteen songs, all of them punctuated by Clarence's vibrant sax playing. These live recordings really embody what was so wonderful, and vital, about Springsteen in those early days, before ""Born in the USA"" came around. Listening to this concert also shows that it wasn't just Bruce's songs and charisma that thrilled audiences; it was a band effort. Listen to these songs, smile and remember the greatness of Bruce, Clarence, and the band. Their version of ""Quarter to Three,"" the old Gary U.S. Bonds hit that's one of the encores on this Hammersmith Odeon, show how this band was able to transform an ""oldie"" and make it their own. This album is nothing but a brilliant rock and roll performance. I'm a believer."
4,Believe It Or Not...,"...I was at this show. To say it was excellent would be to understate the case...I don't think the UK had seen such a committed performer in years......the CD is a reasonable capture of the set list. But I distinctly remember a truly riveting version of 'Pretty Flamingo,' with a long spoken intro, and a run at the Mitch Ryder version of See See Rider as highspots...but it was getting on for a three-hour show, so you can't have everything, I guess......this was most definitely his best period...to me, anyway..."
5,How to ruin your record collection...,"1. Buy this album...NOW2. Do not look at the track listing.3. Put the album on you stereo.4. Raise volume to max.5. Sit (if you can) and enjoy.Listening to this album as it was performed 30 years ago will make you never want to listen to anything else ever again. Every record you have ever heard will sound cheap compared to this. Any band that has ever performed, whether they know it or not, was trying to sound like this. Songs that are now classics sound new and fresh on this recording. Listening to this concert will make you happy you are alive. No joke."
4,Hammersmith review,"I like this one a lot. I'm satisfied with it. It has many of my favorite Springstein songs, so I'm happy with it"
5,Loved it,"It is a great and sad story. I love bollywood even though i'm hispanic, Aishwara Ray and her husband make a great couple on and off the screen."
4,Throwback Book Keeps Kids (and Adults) Engaged,"Wonderful and creative drawings set imaginations free and give a glimpse into American culture of the times. A lot of fun to look at the detailed drawings, especially in the company of inquisitive 6 year olds! This is one that they'll probably remember in 20 years..."
1,Not appropriate for young readers,"Bought this as a gift for my 12-year old nephew, who likes contraptions. Returned book, as it was inappropriate for this age. Much of the humor was risque and too out-of-date for a younger reader. Even as an adult, I did not find this book intriguing. Also, quality of the reproduced drawings was poor."
2,Rube Goldberg Book,"For whatever reason, although my son's totally facinated by Rub Goldberg things, there wasn't much of an interest for this book"
1,I thought It Would Be Better,"The concept of accomplishing a ridiculously simple task with incredible complexity, is invented and taught here by Rube Goldberg.As mechanical engineers in college, we used to play around with this concept quite often.The use of unpredictable things in his cartoons (people, animals) make a cartoon look impossible, if it isn't enough already.A plant being watered and growing (in a couple of seconds) to accompllish a task is to me, not possible, but at least predictable. An animal or person being heated up, causes Goldberg's desired effect only because he drew the human to do so. But for the human, the number of possible responses are many. We all know that the watered plant will do only one thing. Go up. The time suggested for it to do so; therein lies the humor."
4,Almost Johnny,"I'm not an experienced music reviewer, and I admit I bought the album because of the cover image and the name of the artist.He sounds a lot like Johnny Cash, which I guess is good and not-so-good.I would like to have heard some of Red Crow's own styling on Johnny's songs.I'm not complaining, and will look up more of his albums to see what he does on his own."
4,Jing,"During his search for gold and other stuff, he finds out about his mother. In twilight tales, Jing's mom has a messenger that helps Jing with the path he took, being king of bandits!When I first had the book, number one, it was ok. Then when I got into it, it got fascinating and kind of funny. I would rate this book 8 out of 10 because all kinds of events are all astonishing.Try this book out , you might even like it. In very book, it's about girls getting hurt or about to get hurt. I don't know everyone's taste about this book, but I like this book.I think if you really like comic book this is the book you would really like. If you like books about adventure this is the book you want. If you like girls about to be hurt this is still the book you want. You could find this book in book places. Try it at Newberry Comics they got comics there too! This book gave me an idea of being a bandit and a person on the streets. If you read this book, you will find out why Jing does this for living!"
4,The Tale Continues,"This a beautiful read, and it follows a similar formula to the original. I recommend reading this, but only if you followed the adventures of the prior Jing: King of Bandits."
5,My mom was diagnosed with Pick's Disease.....,"Just a few months before losing my dad to the ravages of diabetes, I learned I would lose my mom to a much less familiar form of dementia called Pick's Disease (plus she was diagnosed with the more familiar Alzheimer's). I must have bought a dozen books about dementia, but the one titled ""Losing Lou-Ann"" was specifically about Pick's Disease, or Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Written by her husband, Clinton A. Erb, it is a loving, heart-wrenching and sometimes humorous account of his wife's rapid decline in a very short period of time. It provided me the information I needed about what to do and questions to ask, as well as a 'heads up' about what I might expect to experience with my mom's decline. I am so thankful for Mr. Erb's literary efforts! This is invaluable reading for anyone faced with this insidious disease. Thank you, Mr. Erb, and God bless you!!"
5,Wonderful book,"I couldn't put it down. This is an incredible book. So well written, I can't say enough of how great this book is. All I can say is make sure when you start reading it you have the time, because it is addictive. My heart goes out to Mr.Erb."
3,"Nothing like ""From Monday to Sunday""","And that's a bad thing.Just not at all what I was expecting, and not the sort of music I could listen to again and again (as I can with FMTS). Very disappointing."
1,boo!,"as a long-time nick heyward fan (bought haircut 100 when it was released) i'm very disappointed by this effort. the jazzy happy-go-lucky pop melodies i've come to enjoy (and expect) have been replaced by erratic noise. for some reason, he's decided to pay homage paul mccartney who hasn't put out anything worthwhile in years. when it came time to pick a song from the album to put on my own ""best of nick heyward"" compilation, only the mildly entertaining ""chelsey sky"" made the cut. if you're not familiar with nick heyward, you may like it. if you're a fan, you'll feel betrayed. the club boy needs to spend some more time at sea."
5,Just Right!,"I purchase a supply of these books evey so often to keep on hand for the new mothers in our church. A friend gave it to me when my son was born and I just loved it. The birth of a baby is such a wonderful, sensitive time and this touches your heart and spirit in all the right ways."
4,Interlinear Classic Texts of Theurgy,This version of Chaldean Oracles is new academic study results than those of Thomas Tayler or Westcott. Most preferble point is the style of interlinear with Greek originals/English translations. Some theurgists or practical magicians need to check reliabilities of Westcott translations. So this book is Good choice to examine.
3,"concept wonderful, execution not of quality","I waited some time before purchasing this book, and was pleased to see the format and directions. I'll keep using it, but I'm dissapointed in the quality of the paper and binding. Although it's only a month old, I took it to the Cape (but not the beach!) and it buckled in humidity. I have a dozen journals, and my favorites now are soft-bound leather covered, with fine paper. Even though it is hardbound, The Artist's Way Journal (Julia Cameron) has held up better for me (hardbound) over 6 years and many trips than this has in one month."
3,super-duper structured,"this journal is a fantastic idea except it's a little too structured for someone who's, i don't know... artsy. if you want something similar that promotes the same sort of stuff except in a more relaxed, pro-creativity and fun way, i absolutely love and adore my SARK journal. in fact, you can buy it here, but for some reason amazon doesn't bring it up if you search under ""blank book"" or ""journal,"" and that's just really silly. so you need to search under ""sark""... anyways, if you're someone who wants to just collect your thoughts and save them up, really, this blank book is great. but, if you're buying a journal for someone who writes big and loopy, who loves color and drama and silliness, who smiles a lot and acts sorta goofy- go for the sark one. they will adore it. it's just darling..."
3,A not so modern and a little messy factbook,"The book is allright for a novice. If you already know a bit about PNG, it is not worth the money. There is however a shortage of such books. I read it before I was sent there on a business trip and it helped a little"
2,Zzzzzz......,"I bought this video to show to my 10th grade classes before starting our Shakespeare unit to give them an idea of who Shakespeare was and what was going on in history while he was writing. The video technically covers both of these topics. But it is SO PAINFUL to watch. I am fascinated by Elizabethan times and by the life of Shakespeare, and I can barely force myself to focus on what is being said in the video. The entire 50 minutes is basically a collection of drawings from the time, nature scenes, and people wandering around in period costume, while a pair of narrators trade back and forth, reading in a monotone about things that should be really interesting but instead end up sounding dry and pointless. Honestly, I doubt I will even show it to my classes. I go to a lot of effort to make Shakespeare's writing (as well as English history) vibrant and interesting. This video is everything people think about when they think ""Shakespeare = boring."""
2,Not great for black walnuts,"I bought this hoping it would help pick up our many walnuts! It picks up the nuts ok but it takes so long to empty the thing, I might as well pick them up by hand. It picks up about 20 nuts so if you have a lot, don't waste your money. I was very disappointed with this product. It is very hard to empty and one of the tines broke the first time I used it. I ended up buying a huge shop vac for the job."
4,This film will inspire a cult-following!,"This movie had me in its grip. I can't recall a weak point in it. The visual effects are stunning both in reality and the dream scenes. Competent acting but the movie's real strength lies in the plot. It's just not your typical serial killer movie. It deserves a lot of credit for adding a little originality to an over-used subject. (And yes, I know about the movie 'Dreamscape'. It's a fine movie too!)"
4,Good movie!!!,"Before Jennifer Lopez tried ruling the world she was becoming to show an acquired taste in appearing in very good movies...well one or two to be exact until she blew it and planted a nice golden ego seed in her head. This movie is cool and I recommend the horse part...I think that's how they really make hot dogs!!! IT's a good movie with very strong visual presentation and the acting is decent but in the end I was a little taken back at how she decided to show herself as the ""virgin"" Mary Magdelaine to calm the little boy inside the murderer's mind down. Overall I am glad I have this movie I haven't seen much like this!"
3,Disturbing scary creepy as hell but lose Jennifer,I still say Lopez cannot act but the storyline and quite amazing scenery costumes special effects make up for it. I liked the trance-like dementia filmography when Jennifer was exploring the psychopath's mind during his coma. Very scary and eerie. Very frightening look into someone who has this disorder and what they're capable of and the effects their childhood has upon them as an adult. Lopez does not suit this role as a doctor. Even though she had the empathetic part down she lacked intensity and didn't have the clinical look you'd expect for that authentic feel to the character she's to portray. Everytime I saw her I felt I could see her in a rap video shaking her boody all over the place. But the beauty is directors don't care if she can lure people in at the box office real acting can take a back seat. She shows them the money! The other actors can pick up the slack.
3,Trippy images...,"and wonderful artistic work in this film make it what it is; GREAT! Nothing so spectacular you will rate it as the best film you saw, but definately worth ones time. I love some of the images in this flick... but I tend to have a morbid sense of humor. ^_~"
1,Glitz can't save this stinker,"Terrible film glossed over with MTV imagery. As a horror fan I can honestly say I've never seen such a mean-spirited and gratuitous waste of celluloid. Aside from spoon-fed trendiness, this director has no taste whatsoever.Why did Jennifer Lopez feel the need to make this picture? I hope she learned from her mistake."
4,A dark but NOT deep movie...,"Jennifer Lopez plays Catherine, who is a psychologist. She volunteers to try to, literally, enter the mind of a serial killer (who is in the state of coma), in order to find his latest victim. If she stays in his mind too long, his world could become all to ""real"" to her and she could become trapped in it (which is what happens for a time being).Vincent D'Onofrio (the actor who played Carl Stargher-the serial killer) was very convincing. I give his acting, in this movie, 5 stars.I enjoyed it, it was different and new. It is not a deep movie, it is, however, a dark movie. The visual effects were creative. Lopez's acting, well as another reviewer stated, more or less, whomever played ""Catherine"" needed to be beautiful and sensual...Lopez has both."
1,dreramscape,i dont know maybe it was just me but right from the begining of the movie with the little kid afraid of the boogie man and then freakin j-hoe with the whole dream thing i got a dreamscape vibe bigtime other than neat colors and cool costumes this movie [is not so good] i've seen better straight to video movies
4,Underrated,This movie was definately underrated. Visual effects were stunning and defnately one in a few of Jennifer's best movies.
3,Don't waste your money or time on this one!,I rented this movie on DVD with great anticipation of seeing yet another excellent theatrical thriller. Boy was I wrong. Too much time is wasted on the visual experience and not enough on character development. This is a story that had great potential but is squandered.
3,A Lot of Hype,"If you like JLo, you'll love The Cell. She looks fab...repeatedly. There are a lot of great costumes and visually it's all grand. However, If you are looking to be spooked...you won't be. The whole thing is a bit twisted, but that's about it. The story is ok. The best part of the whole thing is JLo in all the costumes. Other than that...it isn't all that."
2,Little more than just another movie,"This movie is quite visual. You're only supposed to watch the surface of it because there's nothing underneath. There's plenty of movies with sick serial killers and this is just another of them. He's not trying to say anything through his killings. He's just killing.Then comes in Ms. Lopez. Through her we go inside the killer's mind, but what we see are just images without any form of meaning. The dreams are filmed with such overly saturated colors and outrageous contrast, that you may even forget that these thoughts are supposed to mean something. Granted, they are disturbing and present the eye with colorful images, but that's all. Then we're to believe that even thought the psychologist only goes inside his mind twice, she becomes quite attached to him. There's no basis for this odd relationship. All in all, I'm left thinking that this screenplay has to be based on some kind of short story."
1,oh the agony,"The bad news...a serial killer has just captured his latest victim.He's imprisoned her in his holding cell and if the FBI don't get her in acertain time frame she will be drown. The good news? The FBI have justcaught the killer. The bad news? He's in a coma and they don't know wherethe woman is being held. The good news? A Psychologist (Jennifer Lopez) ispart of a team which has developed a means to send a doctor inside the brainof comotose patients to assist in their regaining consciousness. The badnews? She's never been inside the brain of a killer before.It is an interesting concept, though it strikes heavily the memoriesof Dream Scape from the early 80s. Unfortunately they don't build anytension or interest in the characters. Instead the director relies heavilyon the computer and ends up making a twisted art film."
1,The Cell,"Well what can I say this film is bad. Totally unoriginal, with very little shocks and a predictable screenplay. Jennifer Lopez seems very miss-cast here and makes what she can with the self-conscious dialogue, although there's nothing wrong with her acting but I found it really hard to believe her in this role. Vince Vaughan is good playing an FBI man and is well cast, but I feel that his character as well as Lopez's never really develop fully, although the killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) is well thought out and is shown as three different characters, this is quite ingenious, but it won't save the film. On the visual side of things, the film excels with elaborate dreamscapes and costumes and good production design, but once again this won't save the film from being just another Hollywood hack film."
1,Please,"The Silence of the Lambs meets MTV. I've yet to read a positive comment here (there are no positive professional reviews except Roger Ebert's) that makes any real sense. The movie isn't scary. The movie isn't suspenseful. The movie is pretty. It's a very pretty and a very gruesome movie. Movie watchers raised on MTV and VH1 think if a gruesome movie is pretty, it must be art. Well, that's a rampant misconception. See the aforementioned Silence of the Lambs -- study it -- to figure out the difference between a film director in his element and a video director out of his depths."
2,Ohhh pretty...,"This movie dragged on and on. The only reason I give it the two stars that I do is for the visuals. This is a movie that you can tell was directed by a music video director. This is a man that works entirely in visuals instead of words. However, a movie should be a balance between the two and this one doesn't even come close to balancing those factors. The art direction is the shining achievement of this movie and I'm sure the prop people had a load of fun creating all the freaky stuff you see in all the different locations, especially the horse. THAT'S IT, I'M DONE!"
3,GIVEN MORE HYPE THAN WHAT IT IS WORTH!,This movie starts out weird and continues throughout the rest of the movie. This movie wasn't anything that I thought it would be. Jennifer's acting in this movie could have been better. It was okay enough to continue watching but not a great movie at all.
3,Don't expect too much or too little.,"If you expect the movie to be great you will be disappointed. Expect very less, and you sure will enjoy watching it once. There are parts of the movie that is too weird and part of it that is interesting to keep you watching. I thought the music was great. The effects are OK. I don't think they are great.Very good performance by Jennifer Lopez. Don't expect her to look very sexy."
2,It could have been so much more.,"This movie could have been so much more than it was. They had the opportunity to really explore some interesting concepts and ideas. But they utterly failed to explore them. They could have shown the how the killer was unassuming, almost pathetic, but how in his mind he is strong and powerful. But they never really explored it in any deapth.But what utterly destroys this film is Jennifer Lopez. She mumbles all her lines and delivers the role with as much animation as the kid in the coma.This movie just didn't want to try hard enough. As soon as the effects started it was just, look at the pretty images. Although the images are impressive it doesn't carry the movie.It is another example of making a half hearted effort and hoping the audience won't try and think."
3,DESERVES 2 1/2 STARS COOL THRILLER!,"This is a very good scary thriller. I would have rated it higher because of some of the nightmarish sequences,but I thought the story was confusing at times,so it really should be a 2 1/2 star rating. There are some good scary moments in this better than average serial killer yarn. The DVD transfer looks very good and it has some cool extras."
3,Disturbingly disgusting yet watchable,"Yikes. This movie is disturbing. Anytime you see something disgusting and you think that it cant get any worse, well thing again. I dont think this movie was horrible but its just disturbing. I just like it because of jennifer lopez and in one scene shes in her undies lol."
1,I am so disappointed in Jennifer Lopez!!!!!!!,"The movie is one the most terrible concotions I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. That whole ""going inside the mind of a killer"" plot was a crock. I thought ""The Cell"" was a stupid movie, and Jennifer Lopez was acting way below her potential.To top it off I was bored most of the time anyway."
1,Great movie but .....,Great movie but it does not include either spanish audio or spanish subtitles. What is happening with New Line Home Video?. It stinks.
2,not so much....,"tho the title that came was exactly what we ordered,and the shipping was right n time, the case was lacking anything to be desired, which i could have looked past except the disc itself was scratched to hell and skips a lot. so 2 stars for having the order correct and wonderful shipping time, but as far as product itself, not so much"
2,2 stars for uniqueness & effort,"I agree on the following counts: (1) the plot is too shallow; (2) J. Lopez should stop 'acting' & (3) the fim relied heavily on the effects.But let us give the director some credit for his work for it takes creativity & uniqueness to come up with something different & infamous for the market to view. Oh, & yes, great effort to pull the entire film together."
2,Vincent D'Onofrio,"I thought this movie was utterly boring, and even moreso when I heard some of the director's commentary of his motive behind some of the scenes. Frankly, the only reason I even saw it was to enjoy Vincent D'Onofrio's performance, because he is a very talented actor. If you are an avid D'Onofrio fan then I recommend renting it on DVD and at least watching the scenes he is in. The visual affects were entertaining as well."
4,"""GREAT!""",This product came in the time expected and it was in excellent condition. I would highly recommend.
3,It is good when you're young....,"I feel a little bit old for this movie, well I'm 26, but I used to like it so much when I was 19... I don't know why, but I think is because it a lot of science ficcion"
5,One of the most visually amazing movies ever made (4.5 stars),"This is up there as one of my favorite movies of all time. As with many of my reviews i'll skip the plot since this is a heavily reviewed movie and you've probably read what it's about.The reason this is one of my all time favorites is simple. It's not because of the plot, although the plot is still interesting. Maybe a bit over the top but necessary to bring out the meat of this film. It's not because of the acting, although Jennifer Lopez does a decent job and Vincent D'Onofrio is simply spectacular. Let me also add that Lopez was well cast because she makes the ""dream world"" look that much better. The reason I love this film so much is the amazing visuals, costumes, and set designs. Every scene in the ""dream world"" is simply breathtaking. Images that stick with you for some time after viewing this movie. The makeup and costumes on Vincent and how they constantly changes are fantastic. The effects still look good today."
3,Losing My Religion,"This movie in a nutshell is a 2 hour long music video with mediocre acting. Yes, ""The Cell"" is filmed extremely well, very creative directing and set dressing. The problem I had with the film is the story dragged you down and lacked a certain gripping intensity. ""The Cell"" is yet another film that seemed to be subconsciously inspired by the movie ""Seven"". It also incorporated elements of the classic ""The Silence of the Lambs"". I was repelled by the glaring similarities, and I took offense to the blatant thievery. Great to watch and marvel at, the grotesque nature of the film is shocking indeed. But the absence of intellect damage this film's credibility, due in part to a meandering plotline. The saving grace to the film's demise is a brilliantly bottled visual splendour."
2,Bad Sci-fi,"This movie is like one big music video. Admittedly, the movie has phenomenal special effects. The story line and acting however is not close to par. Watch Matrix for depth and Silence of the Lambs for thrills and suspense. This movie was marketed as a combo of these two. It is not close in calibur. Big disappointment."
5,weight lifting and suspense,"In the movie jenifer lopez gets knocked out by a female weight lifter and gets carried over the weigh lifters shoulder for awhile. it is a good movie, i thought that was the best part. the rest is hard to understand. all in all, i would buy it specially those who r lopez fns."
1,"Forget the movie, just look at the few pretty pictures.","This film has only one thing going for it: lavish Peter Greeneway style visuals (I'm it seems one of the very few people who REALLY LIKE ""Prospero's books""!). This movie has everything else against it. Boring story, boring uninteresting actors, a SciFi value lower than a ""bad"" episode of Transformers and a lot of sickening shots which are a rip-off of that other bad shock movie ""Silence of the lambs"". These shots are intended only to shock, they represent nothing of any storyvalue. This movie is like a bad conceived X-files episode. However ""X-files"" is just cheap television and to be enjoyed on that level. A theatermovie should be far more sophisticated since what else do you have that bigger budget for? All in all this movie is 90% waste of perfectly good celluloid. When this movie hits the rentalstore I'll do a montage of the visuals for my own enjoyment and forget that there ever was such a person as Jennifer ""I can't act"" Lopez."
1,One of the worst.....,"By far one of the worst movies of all time. The Cell rates right down there with ""Howard the Duck"" and ""Stigmata"", which are perhaps the two worst movies in the history of mankind.The story... stinks, the acting is borderline bearable (I'm a Vince Vaughn fan, and although I can't say anything bad about him, this movie was tough to swallow), and the movie seemed to be generally without direction. I was very anxious to see this film and was sorely disappointed. The effects were good. But unfortunately, this is just a miserable mess of a movie."
2,"Good imagery, but it's a copied plot....","Sure it's graphically intense, but the plot was copied from ""Silence of the Lambs."" They try to probe the mind of a psycopathic killer to find a suriviving victim. I can't imagine Jennifer Lopez as a shrink, but she seems more fitted to play a counsler at some shelter. I found this movie alittle drab. Come on! We all know that crazed killers were abuse as children."
2,anyone else freaked out?,"I am! Whoa-what's going on in this movie? It's Selena meets Trent Reznor meets Pinhead!The acting really isn't all that good. the plot is so-so. What is the attraction? Well, lopez if she's your girl and a lot of abstract art and ideas. This movie is a trip into the surreal world and mind of a schizophrenic.This movie is a little too trippy for me. I kept waiting for the Hellraiser cube to show up."
2,"I credit ""The Cell"" as the first example of a new genre...","I really give Tarsem Singh and Mark Protosevich credit for a truly unique approach to filmmaking. It's really a great idea - borrow elements from several films in multiple genres! It's cost-effective, and it should allow focus groups to truly maximize revenue from the lowest common denominator of audiences.The trouble is, most of the previous films did it better the first time around. Let's see, how many films does ""The Cell"" resemble? Let's list them!1. Dreamscape 2. Brainstorm 3. Silence of the Lambs 4. Se7en 5. The Matrix 6. Total RecallThere are undoubtedly more....by all means, feel free to post additional examples!"
3,A beautiful but flawed film,"Science fiction films have a special place in my heart, so I am rather lenient in my criticism of them. The Cell is hardly a perfect film, the plot is preposterous, and the story has some problems, however, the acting is fine (J Lopez is a better actor than singer, IMHO). What i really like is Tarsem's visual style. The colors, the sets, the framing of the shots are just stunning. There are things in this movie that I have never seen in a movie. For that alone, it's worth the price of admission. And on blu-ray, oh my..."
2,Have I seen this movie before?,"I THINK I HAVE. Why did I ever this movie if I've seen it before allready. When? Well about over ten years ago. And the movie was ""Exorcist II"". All these machines that give people the ability to enter the minds of the sick has been done before and the only movie that reminded me of it was ""Exorcist II"". All the weird imagery and music and labyrinth mind trip was there. It seems now that Hollywood can not even try to think up an original story. This movie was ""Silence of the Lambs, Exoricst II, and Seven put together. The acting was okay and yeah, the ending was kinda of sad but could they at least have tried to be a bit original.?"
2,"Wish I did like it, but I just don't.","I rented this film with high expectations, with the good reviews it received from my 3 favorite critics (Roger Ebert, James Kendrick, James Berardinelli). But now I end up agreeing with the other critics. The Cell, like Hollow Man, features a great premise, but fascinates only through visuals, with a story that's weak and suspenseless."
2,"Visually impressive, bu Jennifer Lopez destroys it...","It's impressing in terms of the visuals, and I'm sure that the script would stood out more had the star been other than Jennifer Lopez. Simply dull, lacking character. Enough not to own it. I give it a two for the visuals only, really!"
3,The Cell - DVD,"It's a weak attempt at a serial killer film, but interesting is the fact that the serial killer is comatose. EFX are top notch, as well as the colors and design of the sets. Other than that, personally, I don't think much of Jennifer Lopez as an actress, so the film suffers greatly from her sophomoric attempt."
1,"First 20 Minutes or so great, then......","By the time the second hour started, I was wishing that the killer would get to me. Awful."
2,i only gave it two for vince vaughn,"Seriously, why was this movie made? the idea was cool, but jennifer lopez is just not the greatest actress...her character does not once make me believe she is smart and therefore i can't believe she has the job she does (she's like a therapist/whatever)...she is all about kicking butt for about 5 seconds and then her character gets totally thrown into the evil guys world and she gets stuck there...dumb dumb dumb. Vincent D.'s character is pretty cool but really doesn't match the movie or maybe it was just the script, who knows...it's worth seeing just to say, ""oh, i saw the cell"", but not worth buying or anything....really i just saw it for Vince V. and this wasn't his best role either...this movie.just.sucked."
2,Not so great,"The Cell is a freaky movie. Very bizarre. I did not care for it and I think it is because I was disappointed. The images were so bizarre and abstract that it took away from the plot of the movie and the drama of finding the latest victim in time to save her life. I was very interested in seeing the movie when I saw the previews... the concept is great. The acting and the delivery were not great, however. The movie did not deliver all the suspense and drama and intensity that it promised."
3,Somebody Should Lock Her in a Cell,"First of all, let me say that this movie was ""ok"" The imagery was excellent and that's what earned 2 out of the 3 stars I gave it. The other star was earned for an interesting ""idea"" for a plot line. However, this idea was not executed very well. They spent too much time on the imagery and barely any on the plot line. A lot of holes. The acting was pretty good. I think this movie would have gotten 1 more star if Jen took her damn clothes off. Isn't that the point of putting her in a movie? Her looks? it sure as hell isn't for her ..ahm..Talent?"
1,The Cell Review,"While the visuals are impressive,the film itself is extremely nonsensical and its nature is confusing. It's like watching a WCW Nirto or TNA Impact show. We also get a total lack of character development from Vincent D'Onofrio: The Killer. All we get is a scene of him getting beat up his dad and that's it. I give this film a 1 out of 10."
1,Why,"That this movie was made is depressing, that people paid to see it, enjoyed it, then thought no more of it, moreso. Recently the Surpreme court ruled that virtual child porn is legal... makes sense after this. It seems wrong that people would put so much time, effort, and millions of dollars to create this, and that movie goers would pay to see it."
1,Sick as hell,this is the sickest movie ive ever seen although i must admit jennifer lopez still looks beautiful like always but how gross? this is so mindblowing and if you dont want to have these disturbing images in your mind i suggest you to never watch this. who can be so sick enough to make a movie bout a serial killer who kills girls to turn them into dolls??
1,......................................,"This nightmare-inducing movie will disturb, disgust, churn the stomach and just plain creep you out. And nothing else. J. Lo was horrifically miscast, what was she thinking doing a movie like this? Seeing a sweet-faced Latino pop star in a setting like this just doesn't work at all."
3,interesting but flawed,"While The Cell is a cut above the usual serial killer movie, it is no Silence of the Lambs or Manhunter. The psychology is weak and, while the visuals are fascinating to look at, they are not very illuminating (a touch of Joseph Campbell mythology would have gone a long way toward pushing this movie into the ""must-see"" category). Such as it is, it lies halfway between The Eyes of Hell (aka The Mask, 1961) and something by Jodorowsky or Bunuel. The director's commentary is interesting, though it is annoying the way he keeps harping about the actress who said she could swim, but couldn't."
3,interesting but...,Not bad feature debut from commercials director Tarsem Singh.The visuals are a treat but to be honest the whole thing is too stylized and mannered to be really scary.It's all very inventive though and is definitely worth a look.
4,"The Cell, A Total Mind Trip","Working at a video store I get to hear a lot of peoples opinion's of movies. The Cell has been one of the most argued upon movies that I have seen to date. Most people I talked to either loved it or hated it. As for me, I loved it. The style of filming in The Cell is just spectacular. I do have a few complaints about it. In sci-fi films I like to see stories that are very realistic. I need to watch it and think to myself that is an unbelievable idea, but it just might happen someday. The Cell left me feeling a little dissapointed in this area. The basic idea is good, but a lot of the events that happen are just not believable. The idea that an FBI agent with no training in either psychology or in VR can just hop into a suit and go running around in someone elses brain is just to hard to accept. Other than that I think it was a great film."
5,intense visuals,the visuals in this movie are awesome...jlo is gorgeous as usual and she can act as well..lol...love the story line ...all the dark sides of human nature...however...i watch for the visual explosion of the film....amazing
1,Paperweight...............,"yup that's all this movie is good for. I bought the darn thing and, next to buying those internet stocks, this ranks high on the ""What a waste of money"" list. I was shocked and horrified, not by the blood and gore, but by the incredibly poor acting skills of one untalented Jennifer Lopez.....which was also accompanied by a very dry plot, and visual effects that were at best nauseating. This film hurt to watch, like being at the dentist with a root canal. If you are reading this, I urge you, do NOT spend money on this movie. If you already have, then I feel your pain."
4,The cell wall,"Tarsem Singh was a music video director and it shows in this film. That isn't necessarily a bad thing since it gives the film an edge rarely seen. For example if this film was made by another director it would certainly not have had many of its most spectacular sequeces. The film, is a visual magnum opus. However the story lacks a little something, but again it is made up for by the visuals. Sometimes the visuals remind me of Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A space odyssey's' last sequence. The infinity sequence. Jennifer Lopez does well in the beautifully designed costumes and sets. Special effects are wonderous and so on. THe DVD definitely is the best way to experience this film. THis film is like a painting and the DVD version makes it look like a rembrandt."
5,Perhaps the most overlooked and underrated horror movie ever made!,"A young Vincent D'Onofrio, Jennifer Lopez and Vince Vaughn star in this incredibly original and amazingly imagined horror/suspense thriller. I'm not one who watches movies over and over - even good movies. I'm almost always once and done. But I've probably sat down to watch The Cell at least 25 times. EVERY SINGLE TIME I find something new, something I missed, some new image in the background, etc. If you want to see a movie like nothing ever made before, see The Cell. But whatever you do, DO NOT see The Cell 2! It is no way affiliated with the original and is maybe one of the worst movies ever made."
5,One of the Most Artistic Visions in Cinema History,"I don't like to embellish anything, but I LOVE this movie.Even Jennifer Lopez's bad acting can't bring it down (although Vincent D'Onofrio's is superb).The artistic vision is incredible. Some of the things portrayed makes you wonder how they were even able to think it up in the first place.The settings that take place in the minds are mind-blowing (pun intended).This is definitely one of the 5 best movies ever to watch while under the influence (the others being ""Avatar,"" ""Hero,"" ""What Dreams May Come,"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" - feel free to come up with your own list :])."
1,This Movie Redefines Lame. Don't Waste Your Money.,"The trailers for this film are very short because they used every good clip there is in this movie. It could have been a great film, but they blew it. The plot is weak, poorly structured, clumsily advanced and horribly contrived. The character development is non-existent and if the characters were any flatter they would be invisible. The underlying imagery is derivative, with no apparent originality and owes more to high-end corporate advertising than any storytelling. Parts of the movie are so bad, they are hilarious, like where for some weird reason the art director cheaped out and used the body armor from Coppola's Bram Stroker's Dracula as the encounter suits... If there was a way to give a movie no stars, this one deserves it. This movie is not even worth renting, much less buying. In fact, it is sooo lame, it isn't even worth more comments..."
2,Not Worth It,"Just because a movie is supposed to be scary, is visually stunning in a few brief moments doesn't mean it's good. Jennifer Lopez didn't help this movie either. When I Watched this movie I was not impressed, this movie is just a weird combination of other movies. It's ""Lawnmower man, Nightmare on Elm St, and Silence of the Lambs"" thrown in one big blender and set to mush. I didn't think one part of this movie was even remotely interesting or scary. Vince Vaughn acted Lethargic and D'Onfrio just wasn't scary. No good acting + bad overall story= NOT WORTH IT. Sorry but I just report the facts."
1,"Don't Waste Your Money On This! , February 13, 2001","What can I say ?? The only DVD I have ever brought that I turned off half way! Don't think about this movie ,its waste for time and money also its a silly story ."
1,"Surface, Surface, Surface","I can not in good conscience even give this film good marks for being ""visually stunning"" as others have done before me. Just about everything that can be said has been said about the horrible plot so I won't bother restating any of it.But on the DVD (which I rented and still felt like I spent too much money on it) director Tarsem muses about how much the dream sequences were inspired by those of David Lynch. He talks about how real dreams are ""visceral"" and that they make intuitive sense to us precisely because they speak to us at such an unselfconscious level.Sorry Tarsem. If your intention was to get under our skin you failed. All the extremely self-conscious camera angles, elaborate lighting, and baroquely outlandish S&M costumes managed to do was to be so distracting that the dream sequences seemed hollow and bloodless. Very surface oriented film both from a plot standpoint and a visual standpoint."
5,Stunning and Unforgettable!,"You don't have to be a Jennifer Lopez fan to thrill to this dark but brilliant excursion into the mind of a psychopath. Directed expertly by Tarsem Singh, you follow the trail of a psychologist, Jennifer Lopez, as she literally ventures into the brain of a sadistic madman. Throughout this tense experience, you're constantly amazed by the beautiful eye-candy of the production design by Michael Manson and Tom Foden and the surreal costumes of April Napier and Eiko Ishioka. If you can't take jennifer, just turn off the sound and watch again and again the thrilling use of camera, color, costumes and special effects for this unique film experience."
3,Empathetic and Technically Accomplished,"Borrowing freely from Altered States and myriad serial-killer films, The Cell surpasses all of them in technical virtuosity, with stunning visual and sound effects. For this it should garner an Academy Award or two. The plot, however, is highly derivative and unworthy of note except that the film is rather more empathetic toward the characters, including the killer himself who, although a demon, is a very human demon. Well worth renting if you are in the mood for a familiar fright, well worth owning only if you are enamoured with technical accomplishment."
1,Another Music Video,A very disappointing film. I am afraid that once again we are handed art direction and special effects instead of story and character developement. I really am begining to believe that there are no original ideas in Hollywood. Shades of Silence of the Lambs meets MTV with a pinch of Matrix thrown in. Just who told Jennifer Lopez she could act anyway?
1,The Cell isn't even worth the time spent reviewing it,"This movie is terrible. The concept could have been better explored without the grotesque, violent theme. It almost isn't even worth the time to review..."
1,"Pretty, but dumb!","No offence to Miss ( nice dress )Lopez, but this is not how you gain respect in the counter culture. The story was dry and the plot was unfounded. However, in the cinematography catagory I would be a liar if I said that this flick was anything other than eye candy! For that I have to give UNO star."
1,SKIP THIS MOVIE . . .,"It's a horribly acted, underdeveloped story masked by some of the most interesting and charged visuals. Need I say more?Besides being pretty, Ms. Lopez has no redeeming qualities as an actress. She's a deadfish on screen with no depth beyond the layer of makeup she wears . . .And Vincent D'Onofrio, dressed in a miriad of shocking costumes, chewed any bit of scenery in his path. At one time, he was a wonderful actor but it seems he has moved into the John Malcovich school of acting: THE BIGGER THE BETTER. Where are the textured performance of the past?I'll give some credit to Vince Vaughn who attempted to breathe some life into his thinly written character (he was far better than what this movie deserved).Enough is enough . . . if you insist on watching this movie, turn off your brain. You're in for a less than wild, sporadic ride."
2,She should have stayed a fly-girl...,"This movie may have had a chance to be good, not great but good..but to do that they would have had to hire a real actress...Jennifer turns in a completely flat performance...she's nice to look at but that's it...the rest of it was nice eye candy but as far as a ""psychological thriller"" it doesn't come close....this movie is definetely not in the same league as Altered States, Kiss the Girls and especially not Silence of the Lambs as some have likened it too...those movies will be remembered for a long time(Altered States already has been) but this drivel will be put on the back shelf within 6 months and be forgotten...and hopefully ex fly-girl Jennifer's acting will improve or she'll look for another occupation"
4,great movie minus the extras,I was gambling that this dvd would have the extras on the non-blu ray disk i had. I lost the original...
4,Twisted!,"How can you not love a movie as twisted as this? Jennifer Lopez (Catharine Deane), outstanding visual effects, and Vincent D'Onofrio(Yes, that is Gomer Pyle from Full Metal Jacket as Carl Stargher). WOW! EYE CANDY!! The story line does have its lulls (If you've watched it five times like myself), but Vincent D'Onofrio's creepy performance makes up for it. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET......you may not want the kids to see.....it gets a little messy....Enjoy, I did!"
1,The Cell,"They say the human body consist of many cells. Thank God, that this is true because this movie contains one cell and it's spelled with a H. Proberly because this is what I had to go through to see this terrible movie."
1,Visuals a good movie do not make.,"While films are a visual medium, the look of a movie needs to be placed within a set context for it to be effective. The Cell does nothing of the sort. A friend and I sat laughing through most of it, jokingly putting forth stupid plot twists and inane, cliched dialog only to bust out into braying laughter when the movie actually did what we had been mercilessly ragging it for. Do not waste your time or money with this garbage, see The Silence of the Lambs instead."
1,Put Lopez in a cell,"This movie is only good when there is nothing else on, I mean nothing, not an old Brady Bunch rerun, nothing. Lopez is, as usual, lackluster. The visuals are ok, but so what? Is this a music video or movie? This might be a good date movie if you aren't planning on watching the movie...hint hint."
1,Don't Bother,"Horrible movie. Cut an apple in half and watch it brown, it will be more entertaining then this movie."
1,"psychos, meat puppets and J-Lo!","The Cell is a portrait of a twisted mind. The plot has a weak arc and it does not create a catharsis for the viewer - that is, the film does not suck the viewer into the story's world but instead crams the story's world down the viewers throat. Much of the screen time was spent just torturing the audience with twisted imagery rather than moving the story forward. About a half an hour of screen time is spent showcasing puppets made out of dead people and flashbacks of the killer's sadistic childhood memories of his father. After 10 minutes you get the point and you are just waiting for the film to move forward. Get on with it already! If I wanted a dose of mindless twisted imagery, I'd go to a high school and stare at the disturbing paintings and sculptures of restrained teengers suffering from raging hormones. If I could give it 0 stars, I would."
3,"Cell, the","Here we got a dvd with Jennifer Lopez. Its a strange movie. That's for sure. In this movie you follow jennifer lopez helping mentally insane people by a machine. By a machine? yesss there is a matrix side of this movie. She enters the peoples mind with a machine, how original? Well a serial killer is busy with? yes killing people.... but just when the feds want to catch him he falls into a coma. But there is still a girl trapped by the serial killer on a not known place.. This is where our jennifer comes and she travels in the killers sick mind. You find this movie great or you hate it. The dvd is good."
4,One of the Most Visually Stunning Movies,"One of the most visually stunning movies I've seen in the last decade is The Cell (2000) starring Jennifer Lopez, Vincent D'Onofrio and Vince Vaughn. Directed by Tarsem Singh, this movie blew me away when I first saw it 9 years ago. The production design is top notch as are the visual effects and the story. It's definitely not a movie for the faint of heart, but if you like thriller/suspense movies like Se7en (1995) or The Silence of the Lambs (1991), then this movie is for you. Se7en is probably my favorite movie from this kind of ""serial-killer thriller"" genre, but this one is right behind it along with Silence of the Lambs. I just purchased the movie on DVD a few months ago and watched it for probably the third time and it still holds up 10 years later as being pretty cutting edge in its look and feel."
3,Visually stimulating.,"Jennifer Lopez confirms what a bad actress she is in this movie. Vince Vaughn gives a rather flat, cliched, one- dimensional performance. Donofrio is very good in it nevertheless... the story line is rather weak: a sick man who drowns girls to later turn them into dolls... sorry but after watching The Silence of the Lambs I don't find this very disturbing.The reason why I give this movie 3 stars: Special effects are truly stunning! The use of color and detail are utterly amazing. This movie shows that special effects can be considered a form of art. Nice to watch on a 29 inch flat screen digital TV..."
3,Far Better Than Lawnmower Man,"People thought ""Lawnmower Man"" was a visual treat, but it doesn't hold a candle to this one. This movie has a better story as well. The first time I saw this I thought it was weird and I forgot about it. Then in subsequent viewings on television I began to realize it was underrated. The more times I saw it I began to appreciate the acting more. The visuals were always great. I now intend to buy a copy of the DVD. Vincent D'Onofrio is underrated as an actor and this movie is certainly underrated for what it offers in the way of a serial killer mystery. Fans of movies like ""Manhunter"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" will probably appreciate it. If you enjoy this be sure to catch ""The Thirteenth Floor""."
3,The Sell,"An intriguing, disturbing, strange story highlighted by artistically metaphoric imagery. The idea behind it is fantastic, but overall the film seemed too short to support its concept: discovering secrets from a madman through his dreams. An overall, lush, nightmarish, surreal film worth watching, but it could have been written a little tighter. You may find yourself wishing you could spend more time with the madman than his imperiled prey due to the sympathetic use of a child as his true, tormented, inner self. Pretty cool."
2,"It wasn't that great, but it was pretty.","I think 2 stars might be a little too harsh, but 3 stars was just too close to 5. This was a relatively decent movie, although some of the acting wasn't all that wonderful. It had some really great effects, and was visually pleasing, however the tone of the movie was pretty dark. It almost reminds me of the movie, ""Jacob's Ladder"" if you've ever seen it.There were some great parts (the horse scene!) but I would be leary of who I would recommend it to. The plot was ok too. I'd watch it again if it came on TV, but I wouldn't rent it again or buy it."
3,bluray,"so so movie. disappointed with the cell after loving tarsem's the fall. the bluray transfer isn't that great and there are holes in the plot. j-lo, vince vaughn, and the rest of the cast do a pretty good job, the script needed some work though."
2,lacoste lotion,"couldn't wait to get this as i have been looking for lacoste scents but it was disappointing. too strong, but it moisturizes decently."
5,WONDERFUL,"CAME ON THE DATE I NEEDED, SMELLS FABO , AND WILL ORDER MORE BOUGHT THE MALE FRAGRANCE TOO. THANK YOU"
1,Not at all a good value,"Rip off. Unless you have tons of money to spend and you've helped everybody and every cause you can, don't buy this. This perfume smells just ok. Nothing fantastic or memorable about it. And the price for the size.............ricidulous!"
5,Hurrah for the Etheric realm!,"This book is meant for those who have studied Rudolf Steiner's works. However, anyone who has an unprejudiced mind can get a lot out of this little book.The book is about the etheric realm, period. Any references to other subjects, such as fundamental Christianity, the Apocalypse, etc., are not intended to be complete explanations in themselves, but are to be seen as they relate to the Etheric realm.There is an introduction to the four areas of the Etheric realm: warmth ether, sound ether, chemical ether and life ether. Next is a brief explanation of how to change your consciousness to ""view"" this realm. Finally there is a description of what you would expect to ""see"" there.I would like to see a lot more of Mr. Thomas's works in print!"
4,A new way of looking at sex,"This book puts forth the bold idea that couples do not need to have intercourse to have sex, and then discusses how to have great sex without intercourse. The only downside to the book is that it's a little repetitive. It also is a good book for unmarried teens and young adults to read, because it shows them how to have positive sexual experiences without the risk of pregnancy or sexulally transmitted diseases."
4,"Better than ""Secret Suffering""","An educational book about sex with a deemphasis on our society's expectation for penetrative sex. The drawbacks of penetrative sex are made very clear in this book. Finding other ways to explore our sexuality and validating the ""normalcy"" of these alternatives is what this book is all about. This is especially comforting for those of us who experience pain with penetrative sex. It is estimated that 18 percent of women have been diagnosed with vulvodynia- a disorder that causes excruciating pain with penetrative intercourse. This book is a valuable resource for couples dealing with any condition that makes penetrative sex impossible.The only complaint I have about this book, is that there is no mention of vulvodynia. This is unfortunate because this is a disorder that common in women but has received very little media attention.Otherwise, the book makes a compelling case for alternatives to conventional ways of thinking about intimacy and sex."
3,not very secure without screwing into the deck,I would not trust this in a windy environment without an extra screw into the deck rail.
5,Perfect,This is just what I was looking for to hang my Yankee Flipper from my deck. Easy to use and very solid.
2,not like,"their sound is quite low and the quality just ok, my standard speakers of my car, sound almost like these."
5,Crisp and Clear Powerfull Sound!,"Got these bad boys installed in a compact car feeded with an Autotek Sport Machine amp, they were handling about 250w rms without any issue, simple beautiful speakers plus the middle part lid up looks great concealed in the door panels its like you don't even notice they are there until you turn the volume up and look at the little grills and glance at that blue haze !!.."
1,JUNK!! DONT BUY!!!!,"Didnt like them at all... i should have known i wouldnt have gotten much for that price. The highs cut off, one speaker had a short and after a while both stopped playing. DONT BUY THESE! SPEND THE MONEY AND GET SOMETHING BETTER"
1,Don't be fooled by a good price- these are junk,These speaker rat out at 1/2 volume even with a 50 amp out quality deck. Also be aware that Worldwide Distributors will not refund or issue a credit even if the product (car stereo equipment) is garbage. Not worth the time ordering online when other stores will refund your money if you are not satisfied. Amazon was willing to offer me a refund on another set of speakers from the same manufacturer- Thanks Amazon!Spend a little more for quality.
3,OK speakers,After reading all the reviews I was expecting more from these speakers. They are JUST well packaged cheap speakers.But for around $50 they are a good buy.They do sound better with a decent amount of power.I did like how the grill mount with the speakers for my project it was a plus.
5,ZEUS!!!,"Very good sounding speakers, when i opened the box i was very surprised at their weight. They are heavy very solid built units it i had 6.5"" speakers in the rear I would order a set for sure... I have a CRUNCH 1100W amp that I'm also very happy with MAXXONICS which is the parent company of both CRUNCH and Hifonics... everything I've bought produced by them has been nothing short of stellar and at a fantastic price... also can't forget amazon great seller as always shipped fast and well packaged."
3,speakers,well these speakers were great so far. im gonna hook up the 6 by 5 with an amp and see what happens but we will see. the tweeters were ok but where not the best quality for the price. they screatch out at a certian point so those were a bummer but the rest of the packedge is outstanding.
5,Great speakers,"I bought these speakers for my two door Tahoe with only 4 speakers on my truck I have these in my doors. They are powered by a 400W 4channel amp. Not even using half the power of the amp these get LOUD. The LED logo on the center of the speaker is a nice cool look. You'll have to go to your local Radioshack to buy a power line with a inline fuse to power the LED's and a rocker switch to turn on and off. The sound out of these is GREAT, you'll get awesome highs and nice bass. Although I have sub in the back and don't have much bass coming through the speakers if you don't have a sub youll still do great. If you are looking for some all around great speakers look no more because these are the ones to buy end of story. Don't try to go cheap just save some more and get these, worth every penny."
5,i give this item 5 stars!!,i purchased these speakers about 2 months ago and i was very satisfied in the performance of them. they are very clear and crisp and they made my system sound alot better providing the mid range i needed. i am very happy with the quality at first i was hesatent to buy these cuz ive never really had hifonics but im glad i did.
2,disappointing ending,"John Knowles does a good job of developing Lou Colfax' character, only to waste it with a rushed, so-so resolution of this man's troubles in the end. He does present good insights about war, life in New England, and early 20's angst. The various characters around Lou are also very interesting. It was only at the end that I felt let down."
2,"The royal court routine is good, but it is only the first 3 pages.","This book is a one trick pony. It shows the Matt Furey's Royal Court routine with 3 moves. I like that exercise myself, but there is only material from it for 3 pages or so. After that the rest is very mediocre and turns into infomercial for the Furey's website and other products. This is an expensive product and you are essentially paying for just 1 workout (which is a good workout, I repeat)."
1,The Price is to DAM HIGH!,I got the book many years ago and I have to say for thirty dollars this is not worth the price. This book should not be on sale for this amount of money. the book should cost seven dollars maybe ten. Who set the price of this book? Do not pay all that money for this book...I am doing you a favor.
5,Creative Mind,"Creative Mind by Earnest Holmes is the best book I have ever read and will change the way you think about everything. It is a must read for everyone. At only 70 pages, with short chapters, it can easily be read all at once or you can skip around the table of contents and read what you want in no particular order. It is a book to be kept and reread over and over again when you need a reminder on how important your thoughts are to your reality."
3,"ok, but not great.","this album was a return for squeeze after a 3 year hiatus. it is a curiosity in their catalog. not great, but not bad either.if you choose to download it, i suggest itunes. i wasn't able to download it from amazon successfully, but it exists at itunes for the exact same price."
3,Jury's still out,"The jury's still out on this book. There may be all kinds of wonderful info in the text, but if I can't get some of the distros that come on the accompanying CD and DVD to install and run, which was one reason for buying the book, I just can't get all excited about recommending it to others. Sort of like buying computer hardware from eCost.com and then getting screwed out of the rebate by their convoluted rebate process."
2,doesn't talk to a satellite receiver,"After running through the set up a number of times, and finding the es40 won;t do a channel set up from a sat receiver, and only getting a no channels found error message, I called the 1-800 nbr and was told while the box does interface at the rf input from cable, it does not for satellite. The dvd recorder/vcr unit cannot be used to selct channels to view/record from. Returning the unit now.Does any brand recognize sat receivers?"
2,THE OLDER MODELS ARE BETTER,"I only had this VDR for a week and I knew after two days of having it i'd didn't care for it, the features are not as good as the older models and I think that the newer ones are more cheaper made. It worked good but the timer was not keeping track of it's calender right and sometimes it would miss programs so therefore i'd took it back for a refund and purchased another brand. I'd noticed that panasonics are not as good as they used to be anymore, that's why I say the models are better."
5,So far so good!,"I read many reviews of various products before purchasing the Panasonic DMR-ES40VS VHS/DVD recorder which seemed to be reliable and reasonably priced. I have had the product for approximately one month and so far it has done everything I have asked it to. It plays tapes well and records well off the TV for both DVD and VHS. I have recently started to dub my collection of VHS tapes to DVD (which was the original reason for purchasing this product) and I couldn't be happier with the result. I have been using the DVD-R discs and have not had a problem with them playing in my other DVD players (after finalizing). Supposedly they prefer the DVD-RAM format, but I have had difficulty finding these discs in the store and not all DVD players are able to read the DVD-RAM format."
4,DVD OR VCR IT'S GREAT,COULDN'T OF ASK FOR A BETTER CHOICE. THE EXTRA LONG PLAY ON DVD IS CLEAR. I WOULD OF GIVEN THIS 5 STARS BUT IT WAS A LITTLE TOUGH TO LEARN ON THE DVD SIDE. THE INSTRUCTION MANUEL IS NOT DONE VERY WELL IN MY OPINION FOR US NON-ELECTRONICS OL' GUYS. BUT I AM GETTING IT AND WORKS GREAT. I CAN USE MY S-VHS TAPES AND THEY RECORD AND PLAY FINE IN NORMAL VCR MODE. TAPE VCR TO DVD OR DVD TO VCR. HOW COULD YOU ASK FOR MORE.
4,Timer recording issue,"My new Panasonic DMR ES40V DVD/VCR has been a pleasure to use in every way but one: It's possible that none but myself have encountered this particular problem, but since I more-or-less accidentally stumbled onto a solution I thought I'd offer the info on the Amazon website for what it's worth.The problem: When using the timer recording feature, my machine repeatedly ignored instructions to record programs starting after midnight (that is to say, on the following day's date).The solution(for my machine, anyway): On the program #1 line, set the timer to record from just before midnight until just after midnight - say, from 11:58PM till 12:02AM - then on the program #2 line, enter the times for the program you want to record. (I don't know WHY this approach works, but it certainly clears my machine's mental block!)"
4,Great Machine,"This player does what I purchased it for.It transfers DVD to VHS and viser versor. It's easy to read and understand the manual.All the extra things it does is fine but all I need it for is playing and recording and it works fine as far as I'm concerned.I would reccomend this unit to anyone. One thing didn't work though.I recorded a Tape over to DVD a DVD-R and the DVD wouldn't finalize.Maybe because it was full?I don't know.Also when I wanted to transfer the same DVD back to VHS it would only record half of the tape and then the DVD would stop turning. Things like this I have to expect.I only have the unit a few weeks and I need to learn more.I just ordered DVD-Ram which Panasonic suggest to use.Maybe with this type of DVD I'll get more out of this unit. Over all I love it.Happy on Long Island,"
1,Don't buy this device!!!,"I read the reviews for this device and I thought the positive reviews outweighed the negative ones. I bought it new from Best Buy and followed all the directions, I didn't abuse it, and it worked great until daylight savings time changed over. I had the machine for less than one month when I had to reset the clock. The clock would not keep the correct time it would always fall behind 1 hour. I kept reseting it and then last night after I reset the clock, the picture became scrambled. When I turned off the machine the TV was fine. I went to the panasonic website and did everything they said and nothing worked.I realize now that it is a piece of junk and I am returning it. Lucky for me it decided to fail after 28 days...two days remaining on my Best Buy return policy.Take my advice. Don't buy this machine. You will regret it."
1,Less than 1 star,"Purchased in November, in the shop in December. Out in January but locks up after finalizing the recording. Back in the shop in April - no setup display, neither VHS or DVD record function works, won't playback, won't program on the schedule, hesitant to turn on. Can not recommend this model/brand - Stick with the leaders like Sony, this is expensive junk at $325 a copy from Best Buys!"
1,Junk!! Warranty not honored....,"This thing is junk and Panasonic is a joke. The unit died after 3 months. I had to ship it (on my dime) to Panasonic for repair. They claimed it was damaged in shipping and wanted $300 to repair it. $300!!! Upon recieving my unit back, I was surprised to see my orginal box in GREAT shape and the unit ""tampered"" with. Thier arguement was weak and I will never buy Panasonic again. Besides that the menus are cumbersum and the thing required alot of ""resets"". Its junk!! Buy something else!! RUN!!"
1,DVD failed within two months.,"The instruction manual was difficult to read.The help number rang busy every time I called. I never got through to Panasonic.The unit wrote 3 DVD's and failed on the 4th approximately 60 days after it was put in service.Fortunately, I got my purchase price back. That's my one star."
2,Not ready for prime time,"I bought this DVD/VCR in January based on the various ratings (including Consumer Reports) of Panasonic's previous model DMR-ES30V. Apparently, the previous model didn't have the same software glitches of its successor.This is possibly the best recorder on the market for making VHS to DVD transfers. It made great looking recordings. Nevertheless, I had to return it back for a number of problems, most of them covered in the other reviews here. One thing I didn't try before returning is the upgrading of the firmware to the latest version on Panasonic web site (Nov. 2005 dated). People who are having problems should give a try.Overall, it's a pretty well designed unit waiting for Panasonic's attention to the existing software bugs."
1,Won't do scheduled recording,"First I want to explain what I found about the DVD chapters. After finalizing, a long show shows up as one chapter, but you can skip through the show 5 minutes at a time. Not very convenient.I could not get scheduled recordings to work reliably. After enterring the channel, data, and time, the list would show ""OK"" or a date or most of the time ""--"". The ""--""'s do not record, and there is no indication of why it is not ""OK"".The unit will not copy finalized DVD's to tape, even if it is your personal home movies.If you set up the DVD for progressive scan, the VCR output is doubled and cannot be used.I tried to call the tech support but got the run around and finally gave up.Stay away from this machine and this company."
2,Disappointing,"I felt that it was not as comprehensive as it could have been. Most of the photos featured the northern part of the city, and the emphasis was very heavy on showcasing Jewish residents and their neighborhoods.South Philadelphia, which is probably the most colorful and interesting part of the city, was virtually ignored as was the beautiful areas in the northwest.Philadelphia, during this period of time, was a very diverse city with many different ethnic neighborhoods. It was also the home of many blacks who lived in a variety of areas, yet this was largely ignored.Perhaps the book should have been titled differently"
1,Wouldn't purchase again,"These speakers have decent specifications, but as always it's how they sound that matters. I have used these speakers for 4 months now, and they frankly are not worth the money. Having good luck with a Hifonics Mono block amp lead me to try these out, as they are realitively cheap I would only be out a few dollars if no good. Well I'm out those few dollars. My main issues with the product:Tweeters cut out at high volume (seems to be something with this whole brand as the same issue occurs in the 6 1/2 component speakes too).Blue lights very dim (yeah yeah yeah, but while I was at it I figured I might as well wired the power up)Low end is not punchyAttempts to resolve with Maxxsonics went unanswered, I will not be purchasing any additional products from their brands in the future.I prefered the stock speakers to these speakers greatly, before (JVC Arsenal Head unit) and after installing a Polk D4000.4 to drive the door and rear deck speakers."
5,Great sound,"These speakers were deeper than my stock speakers so I had to modify the speaker openings so they would fit but it was worth it. Very good sound for a good price, far superior to my stock speakers."
1,Didn't fit.,Wish I knew what they sounded like. Low-profile they're not. Too big. I'm not sure where these are suppose to go (trunk??). But it was false advertising as far I can see.
1,Cut is defective - sleeves run extra long.,"This suit fits like a true Italian size - I ordered a 54 which equals a US 44 approximately. It fit my husband perfectly excaept while the entire suit is cut as a size Regular length and the sizing indicates they are not longs or otherwise, the sleevs ran over 2 inches longer than a regular should, even though the body length was normal for a regular. I think these suits are defects/rejects in which the sleevs were cut too long. So I would not recommend it unless you need a long size in sleeves."
5,So Far- So Good,"Had a root problem 18 months ago, and needed an expensive roto-root. A year ago tried this product to prevent, or at least slow down a repeat of this problem. So far , so good. After the year, I did a repeat application. I am hoping a yearly application will make the costly rootering unnecessary."
5,effective root killer,"I used to have a sewage problem about once a year which required an expensive service call and some nasty situations. The drain service suggest this product. Although the manufacturer recommends one container be used once a year, I was advised to use twice this dose twice a year. Since starting this routine in 2003, I have had no drainage problems."
3,"Foaming root killer, new container","If you have bought this product before, be aware that it is now in a NEW size and only half the amount it was previously! You might have to buy two packages instead of the one that did the job, before!"
3,To early to tell.,"Easy enough to use, won't know until Spring if the roots regrow. Hopefully the application will retard or eliminate regrowth. The treatments will probably be a continuous necessity."
3,"Technically well done and unpredictable, but.....","Kiyoshi Kurosawa has made a commendable little quasi horror, action picture. He has taken the Doppleganger idea and fleshed it out in a realistic fashion. Instead of being Lynchian with the subject matter it veers towards the linear and clear cut, more Hitchcock light than anything Kurosawa takes a somewhat straight narrative then delves almost not at all into the metaphysical aspect of the DOPPLEGANGER setup. The acting by the lead as 2 halves of the same whole is well done and the interesting use of split screen thru much of the film is also very well done. In the end though this is a somewhat unsatisfying film, especially by the standards of todays Asian ""shock"" cinema. Not for horror fans really this is a much more mainstream picture than it appears on the surface."
5,It works!,"I got tired of all the remotes and decided to try a universal. This one was easy to program and easy to operate. The only thing it doesn't work with is my sub-woofer, but this may be because it's fairly old. The lettering on the unit is quite small, but once you have used it for a while, you don't have to look to run it. I like this remote. It does what it supposed to do and does it well."
4,My remote,"This is a replacement for one I have had for several years that had broken.I found it to be like new in every way, and works flawlessly.I just connected to my computer and signed onto the web page with my old acount and password and it set up quickly with my old settings I had on the old one."
1,Buyer beware,"What a bad experience with Harmony 880 Refurbished? First one came with ""next page"" button not working. Talked to Amazon customer service, they sent a replacement one. The second one was much worse than the first one. The ""UP"" button does not work now. The battery door does not fit properly. Talked to Amazon customer service and a supervisor named Heidi. No help. She said return the product. Now talking to Logitech customer service - whether I can get it replaced by the Warranty. The Logitech customer service is saying why not return the product as I am in ""buyer remorse"" period? I am not sure whether I should return the product and forget completely about Harmony or not."
4,Great universal remote!,"This does exactly what it claims to - eliminates all your other remotes. The web-based setup utility is a bit clunky, and the CSTN screen is a bit old-school (really, would a TFT have been too much to ask for these days?) but it works and it works well.The best bit for me is the ""help"" button, which will walk you through troubleshooting a setup - eg when you select an activity but the amp misses the turn on code as the remote wasn't pointing the right way... press help and it'll ask you which components are off and send the appropriate ""on"" codes. Perfect for non-techies just trying to watch TV :)"
3,When it works it is great,"Purchased this November of 2007, I appear to be encountering the well documented battery related issues. We will see how Logitech handles it. When it works it is great. The only hesitation is the battery."
3,Harmony Remote 880,"Product works well; only drawback is marginal connection when you drop it into the charger - it may or may not make contact, and there is no clear ""Charging"" indication that I've seen."
5,Great invention,I have used this remote for a year and have had several different components that I've had to swap in and out. It is extremely intuitive and the times that I've had to call support they were quick and efficient to solve. The remote is very customizable which allows it to master a lot of different components. This is definitely the best remote that I've used.
2,Some buttons stopped working after 1 years of use,"Looks like it's well known issue for 880 remote.I got this 880 in 2007 and right after 1 year Vol+ stopped working as expected - I have to press hard to make it workafter other most used buttons joined Vol+This is great remote, when it doesn't have durability issues. Easy to use and moderate to setup for HT and HTPC the way you want it.Ether buy it for 1 year use or buy extra warranty.I didn't buy warranty thinking - what can get wrong with such famous remote? back then.Now I have to look for its replacement."
3,Harmony 880 review,"Overall pretty good, but unable to distinguish between volume controls of the Sony LCD TV and the Phillips speaker/preamp setup. Frustrating when watching DVD's- still need 2 remotes. The included software in incapable of asking the right question to get the remote to change, and ""training"" the remote doesn't work.Otherwise it works well on all the included equipment, including an iPod dock and an Apple TV."
2,Harmony 880 setup,"Program setup can be very difficult depending on devices. Learning old remotes is not easy at all with some,but not others. Customer support is good and helpful. I had to have their support.Do I like it now? Yes, I do, very much. I don't have any regret of buying Harmony 880. It is a good lucking design also. So far I have no cradle problem. This cradle seems to have spring loaded gold plated contacts which is desirable. If the springs become weak, I will have proble also.I have:Onkyo TX-SR876 surround sound system with all devices;1 Sony TV, 1 Karaoke system, 4 DVD players and 1 DVD/VCR combo."
3,Worked great for awhile,"This is a good remote, and worked well for me for about a year. I didn't use it for awhile and have been using it again and now the volume isn't working properly. I can no longer increase the volume, and it's no longer available for exchange. :("
2,Great Remote - Don't Get Refurbished,"This is the ONE Universal remote that solved our multiple-remote problem and was wife-friendly enough to make the grade. Unfortunately, after our trusty 2 year old 880 had taken a repeated beating from the kids - literally thrown across the room and banged like a toy hundreds of times - it finally died. I thought I'd save a few dollars by buying a refurbished unit to replace it. Bad idea. It took a while to figure out what the problem was, but a single button would send its command anytime the unit was simply picked up. It even happened sometimes when the remote was resting unused on a tabletop (!). So, back it goes for a refund so I can purchase a full-priced replacement of this otherwise fabulous remote."
2,Great remote Crappy charger,"I thought this remote was great at first. I had it running 4 components including my Xbox 360. At some point my 360 stopped recognizing the remote. I don't know why, could have been an xbox update. Regardless I couldn't use it for my 360. More importantly the charger stopped charging my remote. After a while the remote's charge was gone and a bunch of lines came up on the screen now my $90 remote is a paper weight. If I buy another one it will be one with batteries not a charger like the logitech 360."
5,Simply the BEST....,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O7I6VE/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThe Harmony 880 saved my marriage...it took all of the wife's complaints about our stereo and TV components and there attendent remotes away. The 880 was easy to set up once you gathered all of your devices names and model numbers...you cannot go wrong, I own two with this refurb the best buy of the two, it looked brand new!"
4,Works well!,The Harmony remote takes a little getting used to but is a fine remote that will control almost every aspect of each piece of your Home Theater. One of its nice features is the capability to learn commands from your exisiting remotes and incorporate them into its program. Much better than having four remote and its rechargeable.
1,Still no backup functionality after many years on the market,"I have a pretty complex setup on my remote: many devices, activities, many pages with device-specific commands. Everything works well, except,THERE IS NO WAY TO BACKUP REMOTE/SOFTWARE SETTINGS.Every few months, there is a new version of the remote software, and every time the software loses some of the settings. It is really annoying that Logitech cannot create any backup functionality."
2,Not Worth the Money,"I had the remote for a little over a week. Right out of the box you notice that it is a beautiful remote. Very sleek lines. The problem with this remote is functionality. Te buttons seem to all be in the wrong place, the program that you use to create your function is quite easy to use but is not that intuitive. My biggest issue with this remote was the fact that I could NOT access certain menus on my Sony Receiver. All of the advanced settings were a mystery. I was able to press the menu button, but unable to scroll up, down, left, or right. I phoned Logitech and all they could do was refer me to their department that wrote the remote codes. Useless. Do not purchase unless you have a TV and a DVR. Good luck getting it to work with anything else."
2,Not what I expected!!!!,"I bought this as a gift to minimize the number of remotes that are needed to work the tv, dvd player, cable, etc and the 0 button doesn't work very well. Also some of the buttons such as the volume are really small and hard to find. I would think that of all the buttons on a remote the volume would be easy to find."
2,Teeny Tiny Buttons,"The Harmony 880 works OK but the buttons for pause, fast forward, rewind etc. are just too small and close together, especially in a semi darkened room."
1,"Eh, refurb is not so good","Most refurbs I've purchased have worked fine. Not so this one. I have to sit almost on top of the entertainment center to get the unit to work. Oddly enough, when I first got it, it worked OK, but after a few months, it's gotten to the point where I am going to replace it, it's that frustrating to use. When I click help and it takes me thru the on/off cycle repeatedly, eventually things work, but it's a giant pain and should not be this way. I've talked to other people ( at least 5!) who have had similar problems with their refurbished Harmony remotes. I had a new 520 that worked fine. Not so this refurb 880. I'd pass on it if I were you. Stick with the new ones, they work great."
2,Refurbished Logitech Harmony 880,"I ordered a refurbished model thinking it would come in good working order. Several of the buttons are very hard to activate. You have to try several times to get them to work and just about push your finger or fingernail thru the remote. Many of the buttons are very small and hard to read. I had someone else program it for me that had done it before so don't know how easy it would be for me. The remote is a good idea for running several components, but do not think I would order refurbished again."
1,Trash,"Had remote for two months and the remote wouldn't charge on the cradle. Logitech sent a re-furbished replacement and cradle, remote doesn't work... but it's charged. So now I have to charge the batteries in the remote that doesn't work but charges and put them in the remote that does work but doesn't charge. Confusing...yes, wouldn't buy this remote."
5,Great Universal,"I have used many so called ""universal"" remotes through the years and none come even close to this beauty. It arrived 2 days ahead of schedule and I put it to use. The remote looks brand new! Previous reviews had mentioned issues with the charger, well I have to debunk that from my perspective. The remote charged to full capacity within 2 hours. The setup was easy (although I did have an issue getting the CD to load - which caused me to have to download the software from Logitech). The control of my devices was easy and intuitive with this remote. The macro functions are great as well! If I would have realized how good this remote was I would have paid the extra $$ for this years ago."
4,Better by far than our previous harmony remote,"We had a lessor model for several years that I was very happy with, but the buttons started acting up. This remote has much more substantial ""click"" on a button press and the screen is much easier to see. I really like the charging base station. I always know where the remote is and I don't have to worry over batteries."
3,"Good buy, if you have the extra money, at $99. Don't buy for $250.","The remote is nice, not too flash, actually could be a little more flashy, but it gets the job done on just about everything. Do not expect a quick install and set up it is going to take time to get everything right. I have had the remote for a month now and just now am finally getting everything set up the way I want, the only set left is to get my home theather to start to play the DVD when told to. I bought it for 99 dollars and feel ok with the purchase, but I would never recommend to buy it at 250 dollars like normal."
1,Programming Nightmare,"I bought this item to make using my TV, DVD, Dish Box, and VCR. simpler. So far the opposite has happened.I would never recommend this to anyone, friend or foe. Programming the damn thing was too complicated. For a devise that is supposed to simplify my life, that is an unpardonable sin."
2,Luck of the draw,"These refurb units appear to be hit or miss with quality. The first I received had some buttons that did not work and it was nearly impossible to get the remote to charge in the cradle. I am returning it and hoping the replacement will be better. If not then I will ask for a refund.I have another Harmony remote and I like it, unfortunately the refurbs appear to be really hit or miss."
4,Great item...until I threw against the wall...no worky after that...,"This remote was a great item. A little bit of a pain to program, but once you get the hang of it, a breeze. As for the throwing it against the wall...different, unrelated issue. That being said, I don't suggest throwing it against the wall no matter how mad your girlfriend makes you. Disclaimer: I didn't throw it at her...she wasn't there. Damn phone arguments...LOL! We are still together though...I mean who else is going to put up with me..."
3,Didn't work well for me - might for you,"Overall, I can tell this remote is well designed.Setup of the remote is kind of a pain - I didn't find the Logitech software very intuitive. They try to make it easy, but if you have a lot of complex devices like I do it ends up taking a pretty long time to setup the remote.I would have kept the remote, but I ended up having to return it because it was just too slow in controlling my Home Theater PC which accepts IR keyboard signals. I tried playing with the multiple transmit delay settings but it never worked. So, if you have your HTPC controlled by IR keyboard and want to use this remote, I would suggest you steer clear.My old Radio Shack universal remote had no problems with the IR keyboard codes so not sure what's up with this Harmony."
5,refurbished harmony 880,"This remote is amazing. Simple to program, simple to change or modify, easy to use. What more can I say, I gone from about 5 remotes donw to 1."
1,Junk,"I purchased one that was new and it is a piece of junk, so refurbished has to be worse. The software you install on your PC is very bloated. Install something that must run all of the time even though you may only configure your remote once in awhile. The charger contacts are something you have to play with when you dock your remote so it will charge.I can go on and on. It really is a nice concept, but a very poorly designed product top to bottom."
4,Pretty darn good product,"The remote is in my opinion a life save in that it has kept me from having to have 4 different remotes sitting around. Programming was extremely easy. Anyone with a little bit of computer experience can figure it out. I've only encountered two drawbacks. 1. There is a slight delay with respect to the functionality of the remote (i.e. turning down the sound) upon initial startup of the TV. This is only an issue if the previous person had the sound turned up and you have kids you don't want to wake up at night. 2. Some of the controls from your remotes such as a DVD player might not be avaialable. I am not able to get one of the ""menu"" features to work yet. I'll be honest though, I haven't contacted the customer service on this yet. Overall the charge lasts a good amount of time and it keeps me from having a bunch of remotes out and trying to get them all when I need them."
4,Makes electronic life easier & less cluttered !!!!!!,"Pros: Simple,easy to read in the dark,comfortable in the hand. Buttons are the perfect size. Got mine refurbished and seems to work great so far! The ONLY multimedia remote needed on my table.Cons: Tried to setup an X10 remote but it didn't work, I will continue to try, I'm probably doing something incorrect. Button to button programing didn't take in the software, still working with that, might have to call Logitech Tech Support."
4,Harmony 880,"This Harmony 880 remote is easy to program online. My wife loves it, now she only has to use one remote to watch TV, play a blu-ray or DVD movie, or listen to the radio."
4,A little hard to program,The remote works great but its a little bit of a pain to program the thing to do all you need it to do. You also have to hook it up to a PC to make those permanent change. Even that it's still works all my equipment really great. I've never found a single remote that will do that.
4,Not Bad,My unit stopped sending out the rf signal within a week. One call to Logitech and they said that this was an end of life product and would replace it with the Harmony One. Got it in the mail and it was brand new. Thank For the great support.
4,Harmony 880,This remote works great I no longer have to use 4 different remotes. This one does it all.
4,Great value - refurbished looks like new,"Logitech Harmony 880 Remote Control - RefurbishedEasy to set up and runs my home theater system without a hitch. Got on Logitech's website,chose all my components (5)from their database, which is extensive, and ""zap"", had a remote that even my wife says is great. It takes one button to ""Watch TV/DVR"", ""Watch a DVD"", ""Play VCR"", ""Listen to CDs"", etc.. If you have a problem, push the ""Help"" button and it will lead you through getting everything turned on correctly - highly recommend this one for the first time user of a universal remote."
5,What a great universal remote,"This is a great universal remote, and don't hesitate on purchasing it because it is refurbished. I have bought many items that have been refurbished, and have never had any problems with them. I received this remote earlier than expected, and it looks new, no scratches, marks, or any type of defects. The remote works flawlessly, and does all that it claims to do. I had to call Logitech customer service, only because I wasn't sure about a setting, and they were very helpful, and completly understood the applications for the remote. Logitech walked me through the applications, and were even able to correct the settings via their location and then I was able to download the new settings. I highly recommend this remote. The price you can't beat, the remote works great, and customer service really knows how to help you. Don't hesitate on this purchase because it is refurbished."
5,What a life-saver!!!,"For years I put up with having to use several controllers to get my TV, DVD, amplifier and CD systems working. I always got complaints from folks who stayed at my house about how complicated it was to turn on my TV... not anymore! Just one controller does it all, and it was very easy to set up. I highly recommend this controller."
4,Great Remote,"Great remote for the money. It was refurbished, but it is as good as brand new. The functionality of the remote is really good. The macros make it easy for anyone to control a complicated audio & video setup. With the custom buttons (soft buttons) you can have 100% control of any device that you have. The only thing I found is that it will not turn off my PS2. The only negative that I can post about the remote is that it can be very time consuming to setup. I have changed the setup 4 times to get it exactly how I want it. Probably about 2 hours total time for setup. That is the price you pay for total control of how the remote functions."
5,Does everything,"Great remote. Can't really say much else. I have a setup with a tv, a projector, an Xbox, Wii, a receiver and two Tivo's. Controlling all that can be a real hassle, no doubt about it. This remote has solved it all. I can control both systems at once, added custom buttons to the additional items menu to quickly control my most used functions on the other devices, such as playing video games on the projector and adjusting volume on the tv, unrelated but can still be done with ease. I love it and have no complaints."
4,Good device but read below,"This product its very good, it work flawlessly on my TV, Home Theater, and wii, whoever it did not work on my air conditioning unit, even trying the learn function with the original remote did not work at all. The software is good enough for anyone to learn its use, the device battery life its around 2 weeks or more in my case. The screen its bright enough to be read at dark but THE BUTTONS ARE RIGID PLASTIC AND MAKE SOME CLICK NOISE DIFFERENT TO THE RUBBER BUTTONS. At night when its quiet its kind of annoying."
2,"Hopefully, it's only the refurbs","I had read so many arguments on why refurb quality is as good or better than originals that I decided to roll the dice on this. I had been eying the 880 for a while, but didn't want to spend the $, so when I saw the refurb and its price it was trigger-pullin' time. I've been through 3, and Amazon has said ""enough"" ... no more replacements - the product has too high of a failure rate. When it works, it's the coolest thing on the planet, but these refurbs have just been quirky. They have repeatedly taken the programming (which is pretty easy and cool) and worked for a while (which is VERY cool), but inevitably, each has failed and had to be reprogrammed at least once in the 2 short months that I've owned them, and 1 just finally flat-out puked and wouldn't do anything (1 had to be returned because of the LCD screen and not quirkiness). I will probably roll the dice on a non-refurb unit because of how great these are when they do what they're supposed to."
3,Never really charged with ease,"well its died after 3 years, not sure if that is a good run or not. Especially for refurb... Never really sat and matched up nicely on the charger.. sadly that is what killed it, no longer was able to charge, even with the computer cable it was layed to rest."
1,Low quality buttons,Buttons became non responsive after a year. First I had to press firmly to work but now it quit working. Very frustrated.
3,refurbished harmony 880,"I bought this item few months ago. It works great. Setting it up was easy if you have high speed internet.I had problem with the charger ,like other users have experienced in the past. In order to fix the charger, you have to open it by taking the screws off (4 of them). They are hidden under the rubber pads oh the charger. once open, bend the leads up.you can support them with a soft rubber pad (non conductive). It will work again.It is a great remote if you can keep charging it!!!"
2,Beware!,"The device works as it is supposed to. I like being able to control my TV, Cable box/DVR and DVD player with only one remote. The big problem is the size of the buttons that control playback of a DVD, DVR are TOO SMALL. It is almost impossible to hit the ""Play"" button without hitting ""Pause"" at the same time. (NB: I have fairly small hands for a man.) Trying to enter channel numbers is a chore. The button are all flush with each other. Raised buttons would have been more sensible. Raised, lighted buttons would have been even better. So, I'm stuck with the damned device because I was careless about evaluating it. Don't make the same mistake."
2,I cannot bond with this remote,"I have two major issues with this remote that are deal-breakers:1. Some of the buttons are too flat such that you cannot locate and press a button by feel. I find that I need to look at the remote more than I should. This can be difficult in the dark.2. The exterior of the remote is too slippery and when operating the remote with one hand, the whole thing twists against the pressure of your finger. Your hand doesn't create enough friction against the remote for it not to slip and slide.3. Something about the configuration of the buttons on this remote makes it really easy to accidentally hit one of the macro buttons. It is really inconvenient, because rarely will it hit all of the appliances and I'll have to spend a few minutes turning off this or turning on that, etc.Apart from that, it operates like any Harmony remote. I prefer the Harmony 550 over this one."
1,Do not buy any Logitech remote,"Battery charger does not work well, Software does not update remote correctly or at all. Logitech does not know how to get their remote software to work correctly. Avoid these, not worth it."
1,Buttons Stop Working. Stay Away.,"Like many others, some of my buttons stopped working after about a year.I've been using calculators, cell phones, touch-tone phones, computers, etc. for years. 99.9999% of the buttons on those devices worked flawlessly through the products' long life. That's why the fact that the buttons on this remote just stop working after a short period of time (rendering the device useless) is incredible annoying. And the fact that Logitech won't stand behind its products, or the problem on future versions, is just offensive.It's too bad, because I really liked this remote while it was working.I will never buy a Logitech product with buttons until it has been on the market long enough for guinea pigs to determine the longevity of the buttons.If you don't believe me, search ""Logitech Harmony buttons stop working."""
2,Not completely refurbished,The performance of this unit to date has been sketchy. There is something out of wack with the charging base so that the unit doesn't always recharge correctly.The setup and configuration works very well. The signal strength to the units must not be very good because I find myself having to turn parts of the system on manually because the remote doesn't fire them up properly if I don't the remote pointed correctly.
2,Nice features but...,"The charging dock doesn't work too well, or at all in my case. I had to return it. I have the H659 and it works flawlessly. Which I got the same performance from this one."
2,Logitech Harmony 880,"Very difficult to operate with my LG TV. Software programming UI is clunky, not modern at all. Too much regression to achieve end goal."
2,"Like the remote, hate the cradle",This was my second Harmony (other was the 659). I like the remote and love the glow function when it detects movement. Hate the cradle situation though since after 3 weeks it would no longer charge the remote.This remote would be a 4.5 stars if it used AAA batteries in place of the propriety rechargable battery.Returned due to recharging issue. Going to pick up a Harmony 670 to replace the 880.
4,"Button,button, who's got the button",The technology is fantastic. I replaced 5 remotes. One being a Sony that I have not been able find the code with any other system. The reason I didn't give this 5 stars is the buttons. The buttons are not raised and there is one enter button with only 4 buttons around it. So far I am not able to use the 880 without looking at it and using two hands not one like my old dish net remote. There is plenty of unused space on the display to make the letters larger. The company went for the slick look not the tactile sense that would make it user friendly. Orientation of ones fingers without looking would be improved with raised keys with dimples.
4,Good product,Very easy to set up and easy personalize to your own uses. I set it up in 10 minutes and my wife learned to use immediately. I would recomend.
3,logitech harmony 880 refurb,Works as advertised. Button layout not ideal. Placement of remote in charger finicky. Easy programming.
4,Good but slightly flawed,I just sold my Harmony 670 remote and bought the 880 refurbished.The feel is solid and I like the tactile response of the buttons. The button layout takes some getting used to. With my 670 I basically use all of the DVR functions if I was blindfolded. That is not the way with the 880. That being said one of the main reasons I upgraded was LI=Ion battery and rechargability. I could imagine the software to get your Harmony could be a daunting chore to the someone not familiar with the Harmony software but with just a little time it is all worth it. The software even makes replacing a remote like I was doing very simple. (although some of the activities didn't migrate over). There are even channel icons available to further customize your remote. [...]Granted I only spent [...]. If you have a little bit more money I definitely recommend the Harmony One.
5,Al is awesome,"This thing is so smart,we've named it AL (short for Albert Einstein). I setup all my components and activities within the hour. I even have a Pioneer Elite TV that's over 15 years old and this TV is one of thousands in the logitech database. Of course you can spend considerable more time fine tuning this remote. It has so many options.I love everything about. I bought for under $70 in Amazon last week. The charger works great. Everything looks brand new even though it's refurb.My wife used to watch her movies with 3 remotes, one for the TV, another for the DVD, and another for the sound system. With the press of a button, the TV goes to the correct source, the DVD player powers on, and my Denon powers on, goes to the correct audio source and setting. She's sold.O"
4,Don't stress,I stressed so hard trying to pick the perfect remote. No need. If you think this remote has the features you want -- get it. Don't stress about battery charging and display.Seems every remote I looked at had half the people who loved it and half who say it is terrible. I read reviews that this remote won't sit properly in the base to charge the battery. I have the version with tiny magnets that cause it to seat just fine. No battery issues.I knew when I bought it that I wasn't going to like the buttons and I don't ... I like the rubber ones with lots of tactile feedback. Has minimal feedback and it is hard to find the buttons simply by feel.But I love being able to configure it exactly how I want it to work and having the Logitech database with the latest codes.I got a refurb and 2 of the buttons require extra pressure to get them to work. But they work.
4,Just what I needed,Very easy to set up via usb to my computer. Can get confusing sometimes switching control of devices. Otherwise I love it
4,"Makes the wife happy, with only one remote",This remote has simplified everything for our home theater and gaming. Very easy setup. The only drawback is sometimes it does not switch the input correcting on the tv or doesnt turn on the comcast box. It is very easy to just switch modes and click power on or change the input. It is infrequent enough that it is not bothersome.I would recommend this remote to anyone
5,Great product,"I'm really not sure how I lived without this product for so many years. Seriously, if you watch tv/movies in more than one room, and have multiple components, get this remote. I have 3 different rooms configured with this remote and everything works as I had hoped, every time (dvr, dvd, tv). I recently changed tv providers and switched out all my boxes but changing them over in the remote with the included program was a breeze. The only was my situation could be better is if I had 3 of these HA!"
4,Great remote - Programming issue though,"Great remote. It's really customizable. Only problem is that all of your settings, data, etc., are stored remotely on Logitech's servers. You can't manually enter your own Hex codes without learning them from a remote. Logitech has been responsive with entering codes, but what should take an hour has taken weeks of back and forth e-mailing. There should be a stand-alone application to enter this type of information. The remote could be even more customizable for advanced users. Works very well though and the whole family likes it."
4,great prodact,"work great easy to setup and programingI have:TV Samsung LN-T4671Receiver AV Onkyo HT-S7100BReceiver Sat DISH VIP-211and Media Center PCthe remote recognize them perfect and control them greatthe ""Activities"" absolutely amazing"
2,works well- buttons don't light up,"Nice computer interface-makes it easy to program. However, the button are really tiny, and they DON'T light up, which makes using this in the dark impossible. I don't understand why a company would make something this difficult to use in the dark."
3,functionally good but ergonomics suck,"The remote works well, is easy to setup and understand but my god what were they thinking with the ergonomics. The control buttons are tiny and hard to get to w the thumb or forefinger. The buttons on the bottom are difficult to use one handed. The remote itself is unstable sitting on a table so it's difficult there also."
5,Powerful yet easy to use...,"It took me longer to collect the model numbers off the TV, cable box, dvd player and home theater system than it did to setup the Harmony 880. The website made setup a breeze and all of the ""activity"" functions worked the first time. With a single button push I can turn on all of the devices needed for a particular activity and also turn off others that are no longer needed when switching from, say, watching TV to watching a dvd.It's so simple to setup via the website that I've done some custom setups to assign different functions to some of the Harmony's buttons so that I can make my ""most frequently"" used functions more handy."
4,Harmony 880 remote is worth buying!,"I purchased this product for use with my Directv hd/dvr and Sony receiver. The remote works great with both receivers. It was very easy to setup online, all you need is the model numbers to each component you want it to work with and the maker. The only downside I have found as I read in the reviews was how small the buttons are. The positive side is the smaller buttons are the ones you dont use as often as you would the main buttons like volume, channel, pause,play fast forward and so on. I havent had ay issues with the remote charging or working properly."
2,Logitech Remote - Refurbished Not Good,"We bought this remote to replace the identical one we already own, but on which the channel up-and-down button no longer works. In reading the Amazon product page for the new Logitech remote, it identified the remote as ""New"" but also mentioned the word refurbished somewhere in the product information. We couldn't figure out what a ""new"" ""refurbished"" remote would be, so we assumed it was ""new"" and purchased it.However, when we received the ""new"" Logitech remote, the ticket receipt read ""refurbished,"" which would not in itself have been a problem except that the FWD, REW, and PLAY buttons now frequently stick, making it more difficult to use than our old Logitech where only the channel up-and-down button didn't work. We probably won't again buy a product with ""refurbished"" in the description."
1,Do not buy,"This is a remote of very low quality. I would expect better buttons from a 20 dolar remote. Refurbished units are risky. Volume up button does not work from the get go. Do not buy this model, definitely do not buy a refurbished unit."
4,Good - so far,"I love it. I got it refurbed, and hope it will continue to work. Charging every 4 days. Wondering if the battery was new. The smart buttons are too small, this is the only negative comment I could make."
4,Logitech Harmony 880 Remote Control,"The remote control Logitech Harmony 880 do not work always work with with the devices (after loading from the PC, use the CD go with the remote). Some functions of the devices (Flat screen TV for example)is not working, even it had been select when loading thru the CD & PC. I do not know for sure whether the unit I bought (refurbished) need to send back to repair or replace or it's the way the unit is design ?. The up & down volume work, but the up & down channel (for the flat screen TV) only work ONE way (UP only, not down). I am not so thrill about this unit. The $10.00 (3 devices Sony rm) working batter than this unit."
2,Harmony 880 remote,"Pretty good remote,easy setup but does not fit hand well or quite give all commands where you can find remember. It is an almost good item and for current price O.K but definitely not great."
4,Exactly as advertised.,I bought refurbished one a year ago. It was in mint condition and fully functional. It is almost perfect for the job.Sometimes it happens it misses to turn a device on (or off) - mostly because I did not keep remote pointing to the device during the commanded sequence.I am overly very satisfied with this product and Amazon service.
2,Logitech Harmony 880 Remote Control - Refurbished,"I purchased Logitech Harmony 880 Remote Control - Refurbished on Gold Box special. I received it with some of the buttons not working properly. My first inclination was to get a replacement (I paid only $70 at Gold Box special - incredible deal for such a remote), but after talking with Logitech Harmony customer service it became clear to me that I don't want to have this product at any price. Customer service doesn't know much about the product they sell. Not good! I returned the product to Amazon for a full refund.Logitech Harmony needs to improve the quality of both customer service personnel and quality of the product and then it might be a great product, but for now it is two stars.I purchased Sony remote which is not as fancy as Harmony, but it is reliable."
2,"Good Product, Terrible Support","This probably would be a good remote but due to the lack of customer support it's more of a paperweight. Several times the remote failed to function and required an update to be downloaded. All I got from the Logitech website was that they were aware of a problem and an update would be available soon. Enough is enough, so I went back to using my old ""One for All"" remote. Yesterday I thought I'd try it again so I went to download the software from Logitech. The button is there to download and you can click all day but nothing downloads. Great job guys! No more Logitech for me."
2,Nice for a while,"Easy set up and very user friendly in my opinion. For me the downside is the charging station that is very tempermental, and finally got to the point where I can't charge the unit at all. Now I have a lovely paper weight."
2,Not quite refurbished,"As others have noted, the Logitech refurbishing process appears to consist of taking remotes they have received under warranty and sticking them in a brown box and shipping them to Amazon. Either than or their Head of Quality Control needs to be fired immediately.The unit I received would not accept a full charge and had a broken volume-up buttton...both items that should be caught on even the most cursory review of remote function.Amazon's return process is very painless, so I will roll the dice one more time with a replacement, but I am not very hopeful."
1,doesn't work out of box,"Like others, bought a refurbished unit. Plugged it in to computer to program and got a message ""this unit was identified as defective and disabled"". That's it. No ability to program. Nice, huh? Back it goes to Amazon"
4,Logitech Harmony 880 Raview,"I love the unit and can't even tell it's a refurb.Some of the buttons, like the FF/REW/Play buttons could of been layed out differently as I seem to puch the chapter skip by accident when I go to push play.Another item I found while programming is the auto-on for multiple devices doesn't recognize that my cable box can change channels and it forces me to try to use my VCR to change channels. Just a wierd item that I hope they fix with a future firmware update."
3,Good inside and cheap on the outside,"I love the functionality of the remote. The ability to program it on the pc is excellent, way easy.Only a couple of complaints, the feel is pretty cheap, some side buttons are wobbly. The screen resolution is not that great. That's it. The reason I'm complaining thou is because I would expect more if I spend $80 on it. But maybe I'm just cheap.Dan."
1,Don't buy refurbished,"The rating is not for the remote itself, but for buying as a refurbished product. I purchased three of these remotes refurbished and two of them were faulty. One came with a motion sensor that didn't work and the other came with a battery that was unhealthy (only lasted 5 minutes before needed a recharge). Logitech's refurbished standards are a joke; it's as if they just repackage defective remotes and send them out again (not even factory reset upon arrival)! Save yourself the time and effort and purchase this remote new if you're interested; you won't regret paying extra to do so."
1,never again,"Avoid this model. I'm not sure if the problem was that it was refurbished or that it was just a bad product that needed to be refurbished. It just didn't work. The unit felt flimsy and cheap when held. This product is not designed to work out of the box. You need to connect it to your computer and go online to register it before it will work. While this is irritating, this was not the actual problem. The device will not mount on your desktop so that you can program it. I use a Mac computer and according to the instructions this product is supposed to work with Mac, but it doesn't. I'm not sure if Windows users have better luck, but I would rather just use the 3 remotes that I already have than mess with Logitech again"
1,Doesn't Work,I got one that didnt' work and then had a replacement sent out. This one is broken too. Why is this still for sale??
2,eh,"im an audio video phile.. and i thought this would be great.im going against the grain and say its just not that great.i thought it would offer more or have more convenience, but it doesnt."
2,Finigan Begin Again,Unfortunately the episodes on this DVD are part of a larger set - that I already have....
3,this is NOT SACD,"I attempted to order the SACD version of this CD from three (3!) internet vendors; each of them claimed it was SACD and each of them sent me the PCM version. There is an SACD version (I saw the cover on ClassicsTodayFrance) but there is no cover shown here--wonder why? I gave up on the last one (from CDZone) and played it; sure enough, the bass is tubby, the strings fuzzy, and the tutti wash out--hey, Tudor is not an engineering genius anyway. Pity, because the performances are OK. But not as good as syms 2/4 which are actually SACD--even on Amazon. By the bye, when I complained to these retail whizzes, the answer was (more or less) ""hey, we have a lot of CDs; can't keep track of all of them."" The best response was from Caiman when I tried to check before I ordered from them: ""we are not in position to check the details of inventory items."" I wonder who is?"
2,cleanup-not break up,I was disappointed in this toy. It is made alot cheaper that I expected for the price paid. The broom comes off the handle to easy. My daughter has already destroyed it after only 3 months of use.
5,Amazing!,This graphic novel is a great blend of everything I like about movies!It captured my attention and moved my interest and emotions as if I was watching a great film.I recommend purchasing it.
4,Wildly imaginative.,"Wildly imaginative and great fun. TenNapel explores theology, science, and morality in fantastical and yet believable ways. When I try to explain the plot and characters people shake their heads but TenNapel delivers it in a way that resonates in our universe. You know you have met each of the great variety of characters who have a part in the story, and if you strive to develop a moral imagination you know that such monsters threaten. There is great beauty and sweetness as well without cheap sentimentality. The antithesis between good and evil is real and though it is jumbled in the chest of Dr. Ong I began rooting for him. As the Christian world-view emerges you may realize how relevant it has always been. ""If it is not eternal, "" said C.S. Lewis, ""it is eternally out-of-date."" Thank Goodness for a writer who's not afraid to use his childlike imagination to address the realities of the adult world."
5,The most fun of TenNapel's books,"A fault of much sci-fi/fantasy writing is an over-reliance on creative settings, at the expense of great stories. TenNapel manages to go nuts with monsters, rednecks, and mad scientists, but he keeps his eyes on the ball. The result: a thoroughly entertaining tale, a great love story, which will stick with you long after you've finished.And wow, is this one bizarre story!"
2,Not worth the money,"When this gadget works, it's great. Trouble is, it hardly ever works. And getting it to communicate with the PC is nearly impossible. On top of that, technical support is poor. They reply fast enough. They just don't know enough.It's a great idea. Just not ready for prime time. Don't buy it. You'll regret it if you do."
1,too slow and ugly accuracy,"I bought one, and used for only 2 days, and then decided to return it. The turnaround time is too long. Reading speed as well as transfering data to PC is extremely low.Can not suffer from it any more. And return it.At the same time, I ordered a Cpen 20. It is much better than infoScan."
1,"Wanted it to work, but it doesn't","I sure wish this worked because I could really use it. Unfortunately I had to give up on this one as the accuracy was pathetic. It was not just a matter of a few mistakes. There were so many that the meaning was lost as well. I tried hard to adjust and follow their instructions for more accuracy, but to no avail. It is being returned."
4,"Works perfectly on books, not at all on photocopies","Basically, the title says it all. This scans flawlessly out of a book. If you are having problems using it on a book, it is your fault for not using it right.So if you spend a lot of time at the library, this is great. The scanning delay is a bit irritating, but it is a hell of a lot easier than keeping your book and laptop open at the same time and jumping back and forth as you take notes, or taking notes with a traditonal highlighter/pen and then having to hunt down the quote you want later.If, however, you read a lot of photocopied articles, then you have to cross your fingers. A really good quality photocopy works okay with a few errors, but if the photocopy is even slightly blurry, or the white space is any shade other than white, this thing has a nervous breakdown and starts spitting out gibberish."
2,Do not expect a lot,This product is probably good for high volume of scanning. lots of pages where missing few characters here and there is not a big deal. For a small selection of text you are better off hand writing it and not waste time double checking for scanning errors. I had to send it back. I have to say Amazon service is great.
3,cool idea,"this was a cool idea but it was more of a gimmick than it was useful, my brother used it for awhile and just forgot about it."
3,Infoscan pen device.,"This is a great little device for scanning to a laptop running windows XP. It does have some quirks when scanning, but with patience it works pretty well. It does scan barcodes-both 1d and 2d. Works great for that.It does not work with windows 7. This is bad since most people have upgraded to win7."
1,wrong choice,This pen stop working within 2 days of my purchase!I'm still having a hard time trying to get in contact with the manufactory! Do not purchase this item. It will be a waste of time and money!
3,Too many errors for my use,My son was cataloging his sheet music and trying to add entries into an access database from the sheet music. Small errors were noticed in almost every entry which made manual entry faster than editing the mistakes. I am sure it has its place but not for this application.
2,Not my best buy.,"After two weeks and several conversations with tech support, I could not get the pen to write to my computer (Word), though the internal test showed communication. I returned it to the mfg. Got it back with no info as to what they discovered. Tested or no? Repaired or no?So I tried it and it now does write to computer, though with little accuracy. The problem is, with no comunitcation from their Customer Support, I don't know if it works due to repair or because I upgraded from 1 gig to 2 gigs of ram. Oh well, one can't get it right every time."
2,Here are the facts,"I saw, ordered, tried it, and returned it. I'd say more, but the product isn't worth it."
5,Totally worth the time/money,"This is a completely different beast. I would qualify the Cottles book as an expert practical overview. ""Overview"" nonetheless as it goes over the main spread families chapter after chapter. Whether or not Cottles loses you along the way, you will benefit from the powerful visuals modeling spread behavior as a function of the greeks and implied volatility. Cottles goes next to your Natenberg on your bookshelf."
2,Say what?,"I found this book rather incoherent and confusing. Although I am not a complete novice in options (have traded for some years, and have successfully negotiated McMillan, Natenberg, Hull, et al), reading this was like listening to a fast-talking car salesman--honestly can't tell if he knows what he is talking about or is merely glib. I am guessing it is largely cobbled together from author's webinar notes and slideshows. Appears to be self-published; desperately needs a thorough re-write under a good editor. [Note to self: Always have someone else read through what you write. Just because you understand what you said does not mean it is clearly written.]"
1,"""0"" Zero Stars!!!! Not Worth Your Money!!!","Very unprofessional DVD!!!! When I first saw the item, I thought there was a mistake, and I accidentally ordered a compilation CD, because the DVD is in a CD case. I was so disappointed, at the picture and sound quality!!!! It looked as if someone taped it from different sources (TV, Rhino Compilation VHS, etc.), and edited them, but in such a lousy way!!!! Many video's are cut in the end. The sequence is also horrible!!! Whenever you skip to go to another track you get half of the video from the previous track you skipped!!!! I am so certain I would have done such a better job taping the music video's from TV (i.e., VH1 Classics), editing them, and making them look more professional than this garbage!!!!"
1,Not worth the money!,"Please save your sanity and money. I have a high tolerance for loud toys, repetitive sounds, etc., etc. BUT this game has tested my patience. The game is not fun for my daughter and thus offers no educational value. She does enjoy the bus and the music it plays over and over and over. We had to give this game away. There are so many other games that are more fun for your child and offer more family fun...most of which cost a fraction of the price of Wheels on the Bus. I suggest Hi-Ho-Cherry-O."
5,My son LOVES this game!,"My 2 1/2 year old absolutely loves this game. It is teaching him memory and concentration skills, and it is also helping him to understand taking turns. I have read the negative comments about the music, and I can understand how it can get on the parent's nerves. It would be nice to have an off switch. But I try to just tune out the music and focus on playing with him - he just enjoys it so much that the music is only a mild nuisance to me. I only have one complaint, and that is that the bus stopped working properly after a month or so. It wouldn't play the music every time like it was supposed to. But I called Hasbro and they are sending a new bus, so all is well! Great game!"
4,GREAT Game,"I cannot believe you'all, where is your inner child at?? Yes I wish the bus had a on off switch but other than that my almost 3 yr old loves this game and no she is not just interested in the bus. If you read the instructions it says to roll it on the floor, it also says to sing the song and do the motions. The song is not that annoying it's a childs song and it's a childs game. I can't believe some people won't play this game with their child because of the bus being annoying, play for your kids not you."
5,Fun,Our daughter loves the bus!!! She wants to play the game but she likes the bus more!!!Save all your packaging for this game so when storing the pieces wont fall out thru the cut out on front of the box.So far fun for us!!!A Great Gift Idea!!!
5,Very educational game,"My daughter loves this game, not only does it teach her the song, but it teaches her colors too. She has to match the people holders to the right bus stop. She is also learning the parts of the bus."
2,No Room for Bus,"Well, if there was actually some place on the board to push the bus, it might have been slightly good. You push the bus about 5 inches and then run over the other players tokens (you're not supposed to that's what happens though. We play on the floor and everyone gets to drive the bus all around while the song is playing. I wouldn't recommend it, but the bus is really cute. Put a ..OFF switch on the thing."
3,Could be better,The little girl I baby sit for got this game for her birthday almost 6 months ago and even now she can't completely understand how to play the game correctly. It's more fun for her to simply drive the bus around. The directions are fairly confusing for a 3 year old; it may be better suited for a child a little bit older.
4,Pretty Good!,"I can not believe some parents. The toy is for the child to like not the parents. Personally, I find that the game is fun and educational. Yes, the song can be annoying but you just go along with it and have fun with your child. Yes, the character pieces don't move but that's because they are waiting at the bus stop. Yes, you only have to get 4 pieces to win, but while getting those 4 pieces the child learns. It is a fun game and it should be given a chance. After all, I bet most kids think our games are annoying and boring...So give it a try. My kid loves it!"
2,Buy Memory. A much better game and quieter!!!,"This game is just a scaled down version of memory with bad sound effects. The bus goes off singing at the slightest provocation and it is loud!!! This is one of those toys that's meant to look good on the shelf.Buy memory and use fewer cards for younger children, increasing as they get older. You'll get more use out of your game, save some money, and your ears!"
2,Not for weak nerves,"In a word: annoying. Although benign enough for small kids, the insessant electronic ""Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round"" song is too irritating to endure. The game's concept is so simple that it's really only appropriate for very young kids (2-3 years) thus they are more interested in the noise rather than the game."
2,It's OK,"The game takes forever to play and my 3 year old loses interest before she gets all of the pieces to call the game over. Save your money and buy good ole standbys of Chutes and Ladders, Candyland and HI HO Cheery-O."
2,Annoying,I agree that this game is VERY annoying. The noise never stops - even when it is sitting on the shelf and someone bumps the box!!!
2,Annoying toy!!,"I had seen this toy on tv and my son (5 years) wanted it so we bought it for Christmas. It is so annoying! The music on the school bus is so loud and there is no on/off switch. When we put it up and something bumps it, it goes off with the music. I finally just took the batteries off. My son played with it a little and now he is tired of it. I would save your money and buy a better game."
3,Not the best.,"These two episodes, were not created in 1969. On the other hand, the quality of the images is rather poor. Well, actually, overhelmingly poor. The first episode is very interesting. The second episode is mostly interesting because it showed the human side of Bruce Wayne. However, I had found ""Grey Ghost""'s villain extremely irritating."
4,Fight Trainer/Coreographer Comments,"As the Boxing trainer and coreogpaher w Benny ""The Jet"" UrquidezI have to give a lot of credit to all the actors who worked in the fight scenes. All the kids and all the adult stars had neverlaced up a pair of gloves before in their life. Exect for Jon Seda who had previously trained with ""The Jet"" and myself along w/ Cuba Gooding Jr. for the movie Gladiator back in 1990.And yes it's true Jon was a Golden Gloves Champion from new Jersey and he was a pleasure to work with once again. He has the talent to become a Pro fighter if he chose to be. he never complained about the rigorous training routines day after dayand was able to grasp the intricate coreography and changes on a moments notice. The rest of the actors were great also.the real chalenge for them was to learn how to Box from scratch, and also learn how to movie punch, and take the reactions w/o hurting each other, and at the same time acomplishing this in a mere 6 weeksMy hats off to them all."
5,simply an awesome movie,I would really recommend this movie to any one who has a taste of family drama. A beautiful and touchy story about a family struggling for glory and success. Jimmy smith is really awesome. I am amazed how this movie is unnoticed by critiques.
1,"Movie did not work, had to send back for refund!","My son was so excited to receive this movie and when we put it to play, it didn't work. He is still waiting to see the movie!"
4,Price Of Glory,"This movie has a stellar cast one of Jimmy Smits best performances a mix of boxing action ,funny family moments,and an awesome story of family ,struggle,and triumph"
1,"bad, I STILL HAVEN RECIEVED IT",WELL I STILL HAVENT RECIEVED IT AND ITS BEEN A MONTH..SOO YA NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT
4,One of the better East-meets-West ventures,"Not quite on a par with my very favorite examples of jazz/East Indian discs (I feel John Wubbenhorst's Facing Beloved and Martin Speake's The Journey surpass it), this is nevertheless a very fine example of world jazz. The key is that all parties to the proceedings (leader John Handy, alto sax; Pndit Prakash Maharaj, tabla; Vikash Haharaj, sarod; Gunther Paust, tanpura; and David Friesen, Oregon bass) have wide experience in both East Indian and jazz stylings. Thus, they have no trouble combining the sensibilities of these related but quite different musics and coming up with, not just a patched together tapestry, but a genuinely new-sounding soundscape that both retains and expands the best of each sensibility while at the same time staking out virgin territory. ****1/2."
5,Just What It Says,"Being a musician,doesn't mean you automatically know sound.This book teaches you from scratch about sound basics,and then takes you a little beyond that.I played with a guy who talked a good game,but I knew he really had no clue about his sound system we were using.This book made things very clear,and confirmed what I suspected.Because of his ego,and not being able admit he may not know something,we no longer are in a band together.But with the knowledge I got from this book,I look forward to using and running my own P.A. with the next band,and having good sound!"
3,This is not that bad of a record!,"This much is true- Collision Course, Storm, See You Again, and Too Short Arms are all stale rockers that sound like filler. The title track starts the album off to a great start, however, and the album ends great with Good Times. In between this the highlights are Hold On, You're Crazy, and Broadside Outcasts, which are both really fun songs. I would not say this album is entirely pointless. It may have worked better as an E.P. so the group wouldn't be writing (bad songs) like Too Short Arms just to be writing (bad songs), cause some of these songs are my favorites, and while the Ian Hunter Mott the Hoople was fun, this record is, too, so long as one skips past the filler."
2,"This is NOT ""Mott The Hoople""","For it to BE ""Mott The Hoople,"" it is ABSOLUTELY necessary for Ian Hunter's (and preferably Mick Ralphs') involvement. They ain't on this POS at all. True, the ""almost Watts/Wyman"" rhythm section of Dale ""Buffin"" Griffin and Overend Watts is still intact, plus third-generation keyboardsman Morgan Fisher is...here, too. But the ""singer"" here seems to be doing a poor ""Noddy Holder"" imitation, and the guitarist is not even worth mentioning. It is a case of neligence in ""truth in advertising"" that Amazon or somebody entitled the...""group"" ""Mott The Hoople."" By the band's own admission, they were by then simply ""Mott."" PLEASE don't ruin a GREAT band's reputation by incorrect advertising."
1,SHRILL & POINTLESS,"When Mott's lead singer & main songwriter Ian Hunter left the band following an alleged nervous breakdown, the remaining members recruited a new lead guitarist & a new lead vocalist. They really should have thought up a new name as well. This is not Mott the Hoople. Shortening the band's name to simply Mott, the new group was a group without a soul. Mindless boogie excursions were not the forte of Mott the Hoople; there was always more to their manic music than that. Here are a collection of mind-numbing, cliche-ridden numbers, written by Overend Watts primarily, and he's no Ian Hunter. The final track almost redeems this forgettable affair, a cover of The Easybeats' ""Good Times"". If there were more cover tunes like this, there might have been some hope. But as it is, one almost good track just ain't enough."
4,Intriguing action with an original angle!,"Germ warfare stories may be all the rage right now, what with Robert Ludlum(RIP)'s COVERT ONE series and also numerous others such as PANDORA'S CLOCK and THE COBRA EVENT, but what I liked best out of this book was the idea of a new Bohemian empire and its stronghold on a leaderless Europe. Czech superbaddie Joseph Ryba also plans to paralyse the US, so that their forces in Europe will be potentially weakened. Once again, MAck Bolan leads Able Team and Phoenix Force, his ultra-secret covert ops teams into action in Prague and also Plzen in the Czech republic to track down the bio-warfare weapons. The pacing and plotting are suitably fast-paced, with some blazing action scenes that would not be out of place in a Matthew Reilly novel actually! Don Pendleton seems to write a book a month - does this guy ever sleep? Overall, predictable but well worth tracking down."
4,Air raid throttle body spacer,Very easy to install. It does whistle quite a bit. I don't know if it works or not at this point.
4,Saint Etienne - Sylvie,"SYLVIE takes Saint Etienne's tale of sibling rivalry out to the dancefloor. The Trouser Enthusiasts immediately throw in some HI-NRG punches that keeps them hopping across the mat, laying low Stretch `n' Vern's cool, but featureless version. But the title goes to Faze Action, who achieve a TKO with their ""Friday Night Boiler Mix,"" a deep and pumping dub that features a vicious nu-disco uppercut. Floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee."
1,Caution: Another Scam Rip Off ?,"Caution. This could be another scam rip off ""book"". See my review of Resistance And Capacity Of Coils At Radio Frequencies [Paperback] by author John Harold Morecroft.What I got was just a few pages from the original book, and even then parts of each page was missing. And I had to argue with the seller to get a refund.See my review at:Resistance And Capacity Of Coils At Radio FrequenciesTo see for yourself what others are saying, just Google ""Nabu Press""."
5,Fantastic,"We received this product from the hospital after my grandmother was admitted for a few days. She had irritation due to incontinence, and this product really helped with the pain allowing her to heal. We will continue to get this product for as long as possible!"
2,Strange fit,"This should be labelled as a Toddler hat, not a child's hat. It is way too small for my average-sized 6-year old and it even fits really strangely on my 3-year old's head. It's like it is not tall enough on the inside to fit a head in it. I'll keep them (I bought 2) since it is not worth the money to send them back, but I don't think they will get much use. Aside from the size issues, they are nice for the price."
5,Great Mastery of This Music Can be Found Here,"Biret, who is student and life-long colleague of Wilhelm Kempff and also student of Alfred Cortot has great insights to Chopin's music. She doesn't resort to showmanship or acrobatics on these CD's but gives the listener impeccable, solid performances.If I have to have a Chopin performed but only by one artist Biret will be my first choice. The Naxos CD's are great values for the money also."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I was hoping for full scripts with particular inductions, however, most leave you to use your own induction and I was hoping to expand my ""vocabulary"".There are interesting scripts for particular problems. Not being an expert, this is only my opinion, but I didn't find them all that creative."
4,Un bel enregistrement qui cote peu.,C'est un enregistrement tr√®s clair qui ne se perd pas dans des tempos excessifs. Le fait que les concerts ne sont pas jou√©s sur des instruments authentiques ne leur nuit pas du tout.
4,"One of the ""Must Have's"" of any router owner!",Very informative and complete. I would almost recommend buying this book BEFORE buying a router; it may save you from wishing you had bought a different router.
4,"Almost perfect intro to routers, covering a wide range.","I'd give this book five stars if only some of the best tips weren't scattered a bit across the many excellent chapters. To get the full value of this great book, you really have to read, or at least skim, all of it. But, if you do, you'll know enough to start building all kinds of things that would be hard or impossible without a router. And, unlike many of the how-to woodworking books I've read, Spielman doesn't seem to have any quirky personal interests that dominate the text. This book is written well, covers the right ground, has good illustrations, and goes just a bit beyond basics to let you know what's waiting when you've mastered the first set of skills you'll need."
5,Book for beginner or advanced,"Bought this book yesterday and have already read 1/2 way through. It is great,,, starts off with the basics the router, bits, whats avaliable pros and cons. You name it this book has it. I am just starting out and I learned more in a day of reading this book than I thought was possible. A MUST for the beginner like myself."
2,"A disappointment - not the ""one book resource"" I expected","The author is obviously very knowledgeable about routers. However, the book does not convey that knowledge in a way that is easy to make use of for a novice like me. I did not find it easier to select a router after reading the book and I do not think I will be referring to it much once I have purchased my router.As I read the book, I found myself looking forward to the next section, where I would hopefully find step-by-step instructions, with photos or illustrations, on how to accomplish a particular task. That section never came.Color photographs would be helpful."
4,"Great adddition to the ""library""","Though this book covers a lot of the same ground as ""Router Basics"" its worth the cost for the additional information and jigs included. With these two books I feel I can accomplish almost any task with my router safely. I would reccommend this book to everyone who uses a router."
3,A good book if you are new to woodworking with routers.,"This book provides a good overview of some older router techniques. The field of wood working changes so quickly that various techniques become outdated in short order. This book demonstrates techniques that work but may have been updated with new routers and templates. That said, it is still a reasonable reference."
4,Keep all your fingers. Read this book,"The only other way to find out how to properly use a router is to hang around a professionals shop. After a good history lesson in router design your get the low down on bit design and purpose. ""If you ever wondered why the no name bits are so cheap"" this book will tell you everything about it. Safety too. Not just feed direction and goggles but reed rate, speed, consequences, explanations. There are many other sections in this book. Some are old. Real old. But all worth reading. For the beginner who is looking to understand the routers purpose. How to properly use and how not to use. How to make nice things and keep your fingers too. In my opinion the router is one of the most dangerous tools in the shop. Especially in a table. Because of the variety of bits and the lack of instructions provided with those bits, a novice should realize the importance of a good Handbook like this one."
4,Protege Bike Computer,"Great little computer. Display easy to read. Set up OK, but when the battery needs changing, transferring the data might be tedious. We will see. Keep the instructions."
2,Barely acceptable,"I bought this unit because I wanted a temperature read out, and I didn't want to spend a bundle for a wireless cyclometer -- I found no other choices meeting these requirements. I think this bike computer has some serious drawbacks. 1. Don't get caught out in the rain. When the computer gets wet, the display disappears, it stops working and doesn't return to normal for hours. 2. To switch between screens you press the unit from the bottom, but if held for a second, this zeros out the current ride data. I found the computer sometimes zeroed out the data, when I only wanted to switch screens -- most annoying. 3. After about a year the display faded, and after I put in a new battery, many of the segments in the numerals never recovered properly and remained dim.If, like me, you want temperature information on your rides it appears this the best available at the price."
4,Easy to use with good information,"I really like the speed comparator function of this computer. I've found that I always try to keep my speed above my average speed which has significantly increased how fast I ride.The installation was easy, though I had to read the instructions twice to figure out how to set the wheel circumference. I didn't have any problem getting the magnet to work and the included shims fit my handlebars perfectly.The display shows a lot of information and what isn't shown can be accessed very easily by simply pressing on the unit. As other reviews have mentioned, there is no backlight, so you can't use it in the dark, but it is very easy to read in any other lighting condition I've tried.The only complaint that I have is that the average and max speed functions are ride data which means that they get zeroed out when you reset the computer. I would really like for them to be persistent."
2,"Nice computer, awful mount","Nice recreational computer. Multi line display, time and temperature. Puts speed and ride miles and time right where you'd want them. Reliable sensor, small in size. Inexplicably gigantic spoke magnet that incorporates a phillips set screw. Supplied with the most ridiculous mount in the history of cycling. Maybe you'd like to mount this on your stem, like your other computers on your other bikes? Like a computer should be mounted to preserve precious bar space? No, the mount orients the display such that that isn't possible."
4,Great Display,"I recommend the Planet Bike Protege 9.0 bike computer. It is easy to use and has a large display. At this price, getting temp display is rare so it's an added bonus."
5,Planet bike Computer,best computer I have found yet. Pircahsed additional computer for my wife. Simple operation. Three pages of info. Fairly accurate except for temperature.
4,Good product at a good price,Bike computer was easy to install and calibrate. It works well and displays all the information I need including the temperature. The only mishap I can report was after taking a bad bump the computer jumped out of position and I lost the ride information. Otherwise I am very pleased with this product.
4,Best Buy for the money,"I've always purchased catseye bicycle compters but I bought the Planet Bike Protege' 9.0 based on reviews I'd read about it.The digital thermometer does get wacky in direct sunlight, just like the reviews said, so I took away a star for that. I haven't used my protoge in the rain yet however so I may have to take away another star based on its performance in inclement weather. So far darned good though. Absolute best buy for the money!"
4,"Planet Bike Protege 9 - Notes, including use on Recumbent","Not installed yet but two observations:- the wire is too short for a recumbent or tandem. Planet bike sells longer wire kits quite reasonably with no shipping.- the display is a good size (1.5"" x 1.8""), but the picture makes it appear larger than it is.I'll complete the review once I get my longer wire kit."
5,like the display,"I purchased the Planet Bike Protege 9.0 for my wife's bike after her wireless Cateye Insight quit working. She always had a little trouble with the Cateye so I decided to try a wired version. She has been using it for about 4 weeks now and really likes it. She loves the fact that there is more information on the display. No trying to push little buttons to see the time or distance. It is also easy to reset. The wires are hardly noticeable. When my Cateye dies, I will likely replace it with one of these."
4,Service,"My gripe was with the service - not the product. I was eligible for free shipping. It took about 5 days to pick the product off the shelf to ship. Then 4-5 days to ship. This should be discloised when selecting shipping choice. When I finally received it, it was the wrong item. (Wired instead of wireless) I had to return the product. SORRY"
1,Useless piece of failed equipment,"This unit has a load of features at a great price, but they're all irrelevant because it doesn't work. It took 5 programming attempts before it finally finished a program cycle with resetting in the middle of entering all the information ( tire size, odometer, times, etc) . On the first run of the bike, it did a complete reset of all information, this repeated a number of times. After several more unsuccessful reset attempts, it quit responding entirely. I was careful to follow instruction slavishly, and am aware that there is a ""reset"" function which should only actuate when held 3-4 seconds. It happened to actuate on even the slightest use of the button before failing completely. A set of reviews on another website were for more scathing than the ones listed here - I wish I had not bothered to waste time on this piece of equipment."
1,Wrong item sent,"If you get the version they sent to me (Planet Bike The Dial Air Gauge), add tire pressure to the 9 functions listed.Of course, you'll also need to subtract the following functions:Current speedSpeed comparatorRide timeTrip distanceDual odometer (for two wheel sizes)Average speedMaximum speedClockTemperatureBummer, I was looking forward to using it."
1,Planet Bike Protege 9.0 Bike Computer,"Brought this as my first bike computer because of the excellent reviews on Amazon.Tried for 2 hours to program computer without success. Attempted to call Planet Bike for tech support, but no option for tech support was offered with call. They did have email support, but I felt I needed live tech support to walk me through the programming process. Will return and probably try another brand."
2,Not worth the $,"So I bought this as a mistake because I didn't realize that is WASN'T WIRELESS! ......... that was my fault, I should have read the description better. These curly cables just look silly in the instruction manual. I didn't even bother putting it on.For the money, might as well get a wireless computer."
4,Works just fine,I have one of these on my Bianchi Brava and it works just fine. The only issue I have with this model is that the temperature reading is not very reliable. Setup was easy and installation no problem at all.
3,Occasionally stops working,"All of your info will be deleted when you swap out the battery, but they're still pretty nice. I have them on 2 bikes but have bought 3 because the computer stopped working on one of them. Since the computer is detachable I just put the new computer on to the old wiring after it was programmed and I was good to go.The LCD has worked for me from -4 degrees to 104. I really like the thermometer feature."
4,Nice Display,"I'd give a 5-star if it were wireless. Also, spoke magnet included does not fit flat spokes. Otherwise best unit I've owned. Nice display and very handy to put on/off the bike. Pushing unit forward to change bottom line of display is also very handy--works like a large button. Re-zero display is also easy. I'd recommend it to others."
5,perfect bike computer,I was hesitant in buying this computer but it was a breeze to set up and is very accurate and easy to read. would reccoment this to anyone who asks.
5,Great computer - easy to use - lots of information,"I have been using this computer for many years and really like it a lot. The major selling point is that it shows a ton of information all on one screen. There are no real buttons, you just push the whole screen ""up"" to change selections. It seems to be very accurate, although the temp can be inaccurate - especially under the hot sun. The battery lasts a very long time. I give this an unconditional recommendation. I have put literally thousands of miles on my bike using this and it has held up remarkably well."
4,Planet Bike Protege 9.0 bike computer,"This bike computer works as described. It was very easy to install and use at the same time. 3-modes to choose from, to switch modes, simply click the computer by sliding it forward on the station. MPH, Temp., clock, ODOM., etc. all seems to be working just fine. I gave it a four star because my bike has smaller handle bars than the docking station, so I had to install on the column (mid-section that holds the handle bars to the bike frame) of the handle bar instead AND i will need to make some adjustments to get it to fit on the handle bar. *****MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL THE MAGNET ABOUT HALF WAY IN BETWEEN THE MODULE READER, ALSO THE TWO DEVICES NEED TO BE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER*** IF YOU DO IT RIGHT THE COMPUTER SHOULD FLASH RIGHT AWAY!@"
4,not drop tough,It's good...I like it. I dropped it several feet onto concrete and the screen has a darkened place now. That nice big screen needs a little better protection. I agonized over the wide selection available in cyclometers and picked this one with care. It still works.The large screen is a great thing to spend extra money on. I am completely satisfied with the screen size. It is a great relief from the previous one. The info is on one screen and the speed digits are large.
1,Planet Bike Protege 9.0,Never did get it installed. I own two Cat Eyes and they were simple to install. But this Planet Bike was horrible.
2,Not so much,This was the 2nd out of 3 bike computers I have bought. I got this one specifically for the home trainer during the winter. I like all the data but it never really worked consistently. I really wanted to like this but I have since bought another.
2,Display LCD functions poorly,I installed this on my golf cart and it functions well except for the display. I've only had it 4 weeks and have put about 50 miles on the golf cart and the LCD segments are beginning to disappear.
4,Great - BUT,"This is a great computer. I especially like having the current time displayed with all the rest of the data. However, the temperature is worthless. Any sunlight at all and the temp reads way too high. Why bother??"
2,ride alot ricardo,"The computer is ok,but i really wanted it for the tempature reading,why sell and advertise an item like this? Temp does not work right @ all thanks planet bike."
5,Great!,"This bike computer is great! It does everything we need it to do, and we couldn't ask for more."
2,bike computer,"I'm not to happy with this computer. Only half of the numbers appear and if you try to adjust the computer to see the whole numbers, the computer resets to zero."
5,I fell in love with Beverly Crusher in this episode...,"I think this was the episode that I realized how loveable Beverly Crusher is. Beverly's heart is being tugged when the ignorant people of Edos are planning to put her dear son Wesley to death for the ""crime"" of falling into a garden. The Edos people APPEAR happy and peaceful, but appearances are deceiving since underneath, they are suspicious, ignorant, and superstitious and show no remorse for the pain and suffering they cause Wesley and his mother. I saw the wonderful mother-son bond that Beverly and Wesley share vividly here and it's touching how Beverly weeps softly when she is reunited with her son. I also love how fiesty outspoken Tasha blasted the Edos people for the corrupt sense of justice and stood up for Beverly and Wesley. Beverly is my favorite character of all science fiction."
3,On the planet of blond and buff people,"A somewhat clunky episode exploring the issue of cultural relativism. What is justice? Should you apply it to all, even the ignorant? Is there a place for flexibility or mercy?This episode tries more than it succeeds. A conclusion involving decisions by the crew rather than a literal deus ex machina solution would have made it a stronger story. It is interesting, though, to watch the Edo change from cheerful and simple to stern and proud once their customs are under threat and they realise that the crew of the Enterprise are patronising them. My scorecard reads Edo - 1, Starfleet - 1.But (sigh) Wesley still lives to tell the tale."
5,No Justice,"No JusticeThis entry in the Next Generation Saga ""Justice"" shows a society with one rigid law. The penalty for any crime is death. Wesley learns this very early when he was playing catch me with the colonists. He accidentally falls into a garden area behind some posts. Security guards come out of no where and want to give him a lethal injection. Fortunately for him Riker, Worf and Tasha show up to stop them.It can be argued that Wesley saved the ship all the time in the first season. He was an obnoxious character. I believe he acted the way he did to attempt to fit in with the ""adults."" This one shows that laws can get out of control if there is no common sense applied. I love the scenes aboard the observation lounge where their ""God"" appears out of orbit as computerized starship. This is a planet were all the beautiful people run around and make love all day. However, they're ruled by a machine!"
5,Wish it were longer,"My only complaint about the book is there's just not enough of it! Kaluta's work really requires a multi-volume retrospective to demonstrate the breadth and depth of his astonishing talent. Anyone whose work recalls Moebius, Hal Foster, George Grosz, Alfons Mucha, Frank Frazetta and Heinrich Kley all at once deserves a far wider audience.Get this book, then scour the used-book sites and get copies of ""The Michael William Kaluta Treasury"" and ""The Michael Wm. Kaluta Sketchbook"". Oh yeah, and ""Metropolis"".Go to the guy's web site (not hard to find) and see for yourself."
4,"Beautiful, if too short.","Not much to say about this volume. The images are beautiful and large, mot of them one per page. Ny only complaint is that it's much too small a book. However, at the price, I'm not complaining."
2,Not at ALL like the original!,"I was very disappointed when I put this in for my children ages 9 and 4. It was far too intense at times for my 4 year old and the cartoons were loud and abnoxious. This is NOT an age appropriate movie for the young - Over 5 maybe - but not a feel good movie like the original classic ""Rudolph The Rednosed Raindeer"". VERY disappointed"
1,I don't reccomend it.,"Nothing can compare to the original 1964 stop motion animation Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Nothing. This movie was just ""really bad"" to say the least."
1,completely stupid looking,This movie looks very retarded and I agree with the people who gave it two stars. I love rudolph and am very unhappy about this production.
2,I've actually never seen this...,"This looks stupid, as I'm no kid of 3. I gave it a 2nd star only because Eric Idle is one of the voices. I could care less about the other actors."
2,Good actors can't save this poor movie,"My 4 yr old son really likes this movie, but I personally can't stand it. I tend to pick cartoons apart for their animation, and this one was just terrible. The characters suffer from extreme unneeded movement, the action is barely (if at all) synchronized with the dialog, and the cartoon doesn't come anywhere close to expressing the emotion that the voice actors are trying to convey. It's almost like they finished the animation before they recorded the voices, then didn't go synch them up. It could have been better if they had taken a little more time on it."
3,FAMILY VIEWING OKAY,"Okay, let's not compare this one to the classic tv version with Burl Ives and the wonderful ""Silver and Gold."" On its own merits, kids should enjoy this familiar tale of the reindeer with the glowing nose who saves the day, although it's not on a foggy night, but during a horrendous blizzard whooped up by (no pun intended) Whoopi Goldberg as the Ice Queen Stormella. All the ingredients are there, with a few added perils and characters, the most notable being Bob Newhart's Leonard the Polar Bear and Eric Idle's crafty Slyly the Fox. The songs are pretty bad, with the exception of the lovely ""Show Me the Light"" given a nice ending rendition by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes. Kids should enjoy the movie, and the adults can smile as they remember a far superior version from ""long ago."""
2,"Not the best of the series, sadly....:(","I really love Sorcerer Hunters, and especially Marron :), yet I was really disappointed with this tape. There were only 2 episodes on it and both were mediocre...and one episode was EXTREMELY disturbing! It looked like Marron had lipstick and eyeshadow on through half of one episode, and the whole time I was staring in shock while thinking, ""WHAT IS THAT! "" I suggest trying the other tapes, or holding off to buy this one at least... Not that I wouldn't of bought it anyway, since I like having all the tapes, but I could of asked for it for my birthday, I suppose, instead of going out and spending $ on it myself! *Bangs head on table* So, if you like Sorcerer Hunters a smuch as me go ahead and buy it, just BEWARE, it's NOT their best performance."
4,Safety without Losing Dexterity,"It's amazing how thin and breathable the weave is on this tape YET it still offers protection. I do wire wrapped jewelry and am no longer developing blisters from pulling wire or getting pricked by wire ends. The tape is flexible enough so it doesn't interfere with dexterity, thin enough so that you can ""feel"" what you're doing and offers the protection needed. My former calluses are beginning to soften up!The only down-side is that it doesn't come off the roll easily. You have to be very careful not to separate fibers so that it comes off in 3/4"" in wide piece or else you may leave a 1/16"" or so on the roll."

Oh Life! Oh Love! Oh Eternity!"
3,Pretty good,"I think Ethan Hawke wrote an excellent novel. He is quite like J.D. Salinger, yet for some reason I think the narrator was a lot like the character he played in Reality Bites."
5,"If I coud give the bOok 85 stars, I would!","Ethan Hawk is AMerica's Most Talented author, I tell you and you beleive it! Few authors and authoresses have 100% Pain and Suffering without losing your mind. Author Hawk has both! My Englsih not so good but I think I got the jizzt of this luscious Novel; it is be careful. Its not every day can we change our hair, you know put on a wig and say, ""I feel beautiful. I am someone new too""That is our Ethan. He is CRAZY!... I would give to him all my money if only I had more. Times are tuff. Go to the pool, America, and fuhgeddaboutid! Let Sexy Ethan dance your Talented dance of wacky noire Cowboy-Western adapted to one thoughtfull book. Best buy."
4,"If you like the typical love story type, you'll like this","Ethan is not only a brilliant and creative actor, but he was able to portray the same qualities as a writer. This book was able to keep my interest from beginning to end, and that is hard to do. Trust me. He has a talent for being able to articulate a simple romantic situation and make it an intriguing moment that just gives you goose bumps. I don't know, maybe I am easily amused, but this book is good. Ethan Hawke has pure, rough talent and this book illustrates that."
4,Hawke's debut novel asks for more,"Being a Dutch guy, New York citylife was only what I can understand if I could link it to Amsterdam. Ethan Hawke succeeds in making an urban atmosphere in which that is not necessary. The only modern (after 1945) authors who made me feel like that were J.D. Salinger, Jack Kerouac, James Baldwin, Chaim Potok, John Irving and Tom Wolfe. Don't get cynical, I am not saying Hawke is as good as them. To be fair: I read the book because I know him as an actor. That's why I was interested and I was like ""Let's see if he can do this, too"". The book is a small pearl. Like Uhlman's 'Reunion' the story doesn't need much action and explanation, since Hawke succeeds in explaining feelings and happenings in a decent and sober way. Hawke doesn't need pretentious big words, big action or bearded jokes to make his point. It's never grotesque. Some authors could use this book as an example. I truly hope Hawke will have the time to write more."
4,"Good fall-back, you know, if the acting doesn't work out","I was very impressed with Ethan Hawke's writing ability. I thought he wrote a very creative, genuine story. Sad and depressing (would make a good Oprah pick if she picked books about males), but undoubtedly a real love story. Honestly, I was only interested in this novel because I'm a fan of Ethan Hawke, the actor. Now, having read his debut novel, I'm a fan of Ethan Hawke, the writer. A believable, bittersweet, desperate tale about William Harding, who falls in love with an unconventional girl named Sarah after four days together and becomes completely wrapped up in her in the most unhealthy way. This novel is not for the weak of heart. Would make an excellent movie."
4,An intelligent doomed love story,"I'm a big fan of films like Dead Poet's Society, Reality Bites, and Before Sunrise, so I picked up this book. Ethan Hawke proves himself a competent writer in this first novel. His narrative persona is observant, believable, smart, and honest. He understands young love, and how a young guy thinks. In this story of a goodlooking young actor (who I think is perhaps Hawke's alter ego), we meet 21-year-old rising big-shot actor William who falls for a nobody, and she's the kind of girl he doesn't usually go for (she's not pretty). Yet he totally falls in love with her personality and intellect. There's just something about her. But there are plenty of bumps in this relationship, and it doesn't work out. I recommend this to young and old who like to read about the romantic loves and disappointments of young people.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
3,It was ok.,"I thought I'd give this book a shot. I always have liked Ethan Hawke, and it was a two dollar Goodwill book.I thought the writing was pretty good for a debut, and page-to-page it held my interest enough to keep turning. However there is no kind of happy ending. I don't really need that, and it's more realistic really, but emotionally it was kind of a drag. The protagonist gets his heart broken, and cannot get over it. He was kind of sad and weak I thought.One thing we know for sure is that William (or is it Ethan) loves breasts. Every third page was describing boobs in some way. For that I gave it an extra star."
1,Ethan Hawke could win a literary award...,"...if he picked a sentence randomly from this book and entered it into the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest -- especially if he chooses something from the worst sex scene ever written. I would go so far to say that this is the worst book ever published, but it's pretty bad. The book is plotless and riddled with clich√©s. There isn't a doubt in my mind that this book would not be published if it wasn't written by ""movie star"" Ethan Hawke.(...)Worse still is his character Sarah, who is more two-dimensional than the page Hawke's words are printed on. Women can either be good little domestic angels or evil temptresses like Sarah in this book. It's downright heartbreaking to see that Victorian views of women still flourish."
1,Look at it this way!,"If a writer's greatness was judged by the fewer number of stars received, Ethan Hawke would be AWESOME!"
4,A great read!,"This book is very enjoyable! I read it in about two days. A nice break from the longer novels! Go ahead, try it."
4,Reversed my doubts in actors as talented people!,"I was amazed at the character development in this novel. Everything was so unpredictable, from what would happen between William and Sarah, to William's every action. The entire time I read THE HOTTEST STATE, I was curious if Hawke had ghost-writers do his work. I was doubtful that an actor could write something as fast-paced and full of attitude and vigor as CATCHER IN THE RYE. The voices were unique, up-beat, and exciting to the reader. Because of the characters, settings, and Hawke's hidden talent in writing, I could not put this book down and beg him to write another one..."
3,It sounded so much better on Oprah,"I tried for months to get this book out of the library and was very disappointed. I remember clearly when Ethan Hawke was on Oprah reading out passages and I was totally intrigued by the emotions expressed. Not so much when I picked up the book. The story is cliched, the characters are one-dimensional and unbelievable. There was one sex scene which totally disgusted me and thought wholy unnecessary. I guess there's a lot of Ethan himself there (young actor, good looking) but I guess he's not such a good writer at all. Stick to acting Ethan."
1,Mr. Scruffy Wuffy and the Bloody Green Heart,"I read the hardcover when it first came out. I have a perverse desire for celeb-written novels. Okay, who out there liked this book, who isn't a fawning girlfan? Nice try, Mr. Scruffy Wuffy. I give you a cookie for getting your book out there. But really, people, really... try some Leonard Nimoy poetry, and THEN we'll see who's the Love Stud."
3,Decent First Effort,"Ok, let's give Ethan Hawke a break here. Like most authors, his first writing effort left something to be desired. However, given a bit more time and experience, I think he would really improve.The Hottest State is a short novel, from a male point of view. It's about his falling in love and getting his heart broken. It's about his absentee father and his trying to cope with this most of his life. It's about a 20 year old, turning 21 and trying to figure out what to do with his life.After finishing the book, I was left a little bad taste in my mouth. The book wasn't quite what I thought it would be, or could be. And the ending was a bit odd. However, I did enjoy much of the story and the characters. Even though the characters did get on my nerves at times...I'm not decided yet about reading his next book, but I've heard it's better, so I'll probably give it a try!"
5,GREAT BOOK,"THIs book is great. Very real. The way he writes, really pulls you in and captures all of your interest. When I opened the book I was HOOKED I could not put it down! I highly suggest his second novel Ash Wednesday as well. I can't wait for him to write another one!"
5,i <3 the hottest state,"where do i start? this book is truly amazing. i felt like i WAS william. its such great writing. i have had all my friends read it and they truly love it for what it is as much as i do. everyone should read the hottest state and just man i love this book so much, ethan hawke needs to write some more!"
1,puke,"This book is laughable. It trips over its own earnest, pretentious, sexist self time and time again.How many times can one author use the phrase, ""my hand on her back felt strong?"" Ethan Hawke uses it several times in this book. Other phrases repeat themselves as well.Don't waste your money unless you need a good laugh."
2,"Someone Help, the written word is in serious trouble","I confess, I bought this book only because I enjoyed the films Gattaca and Great Expectations. Ethan Hawke is a fine actor, but he cannot write! His characters are sloppy and immature, (I am 14 and I can figure this out...) especially William, the main character. All William does is sit around and break household appliances. I STRONGLY suggest ignoring this book."
1,No book has ever left me so annoyed,"As far as I can tell, the theme of actor Ethan Hawke's first published novel seems to be, ""Hi, I'm actor Ethan Hawke. This is my first published novel."" The plot of pretentious know-it-all narrator meets and falls for annoying-shallowly-written girl will be familiar to anyone whose ever taken a freshman creative writing course. At last estimate, there are about 20,000 aspiring writers out there so in all probability, there are indeed worst books than this. However, most of those books don't get published because most of those authors haven't appeared on the cover of Premiere. As I read this book, all I could think about were all the aspiring writers out there who don't have the luxury of getting their first drafts published."
5,For anyone who has ever loved and lost...,"This is an impressive and excellent novel that captures the emotions of a relationship. Anyone who has ever been in love and lost before can relate to what Hawke writes about in this story. Everyone does crazy things when the love they give is not returned,just like the character William does in this novel. Even if you don't like to read, you will love this book!"
4,"Ordinary, yet genuine","""I thought it was sad, but then again, i think all stories are sad"" -perfect example of the genuine hidden throughout the novel. Good for those who embrace tender moments and can get past seeing the word ""breast"" on every page."
2,"Ethan Hawkes, The Hottest State lacked any real insight.","This story was dissapointing but to be expected from a first time author. A friend recommended this book to me but I failed to see the emotion and the passion I was hoping it would include. I thought that the characters were shallow. The author could have made a much better story it the characters could have been explored deeper in order to make their actions more understood. It was a sketchy story with a very basic plot. (boy meets girl, boy falls in love, girl dumps boy, boy sulks). The story was too simple for me and too cliche to hold my interest. The only thing Ethan has going for him is that this is his first novel and he can only get better."
5,Lisa Loeb may have been Sarah.,"Hawke himself said the book was pretty much autobiographical, but if that's true then who inspired the character Sarah? I heard it was Lisa Loeb. Hawke directed the music video for her hit, ""Stay"" from the film ""Reality Bites"". Sarah's description fits her, and they are both musicians. Hmmmm."
5,An addictive read....very passionate and emotional,"I read ""The Hottest State"" in one day! I just couldn't put it down. It should be a great read for anyone, especially Ethan fans. A little bit ""Before Sunrise"", a little bit ""Reality Bites"", but certainly an enthralling read"
2,Not moisturizng,"It was only after I purchased this and tried it did I start to realize that perhaps this is not a true a hand moisturizer at all, but a protectant for hands? At any rate, used for both uses, it doesn't work at all. TheraSeal is not at all moisturizing and 5 seconds after application, I feel the need to go apply another hand cream over it b/c my hands still feel so dry.If used as a skin protectant, I feel this washes out in water so quickly. I was sorely disappointed in this product and even more upset about the pricing. My favorite hand creams remain the Eucerin Intensive Hand Cream and the Aveeno hand cream. Both work way better at less than 1/2 of the cost of this product."
5,Hand protectant!,I have used this product for the past 2 months and my hands have never been softer or more moisturized. I have dry skin normally and this helps me retain moisture. AWESOME product.
2,Overpriced!,"The active ingredient on this product is Dimethicone, which is found in other cheaper moisturizing lotions likeAveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion, 18-Ounce Pump (Pack of 2). Why would you spend more on this product?"
3,"sound was a bit ""tinny.""",We like the harmonica rascals (always have) but were really looking for a music VIDEO of their preformance. We've seen them live on tv years ago but can't locate anything on tape. Is there such a thing around?
2,Peg of My Heart,I got the wrong version of the song for my parents - so what did I know. They appreciated the effort though.
3,Picard Background,"This was not a personal favorite with me, but for those who want to find out more about Picard's history, this is a goodie. Basically its about a ferengei who blames Picard for the death of his son and tries to control him through a mind-altering device that forces him to relive events on the Stargazer, Picard's former ship."
3,The Battle,This episode explores Captain Picard's past as captian of the USS Stargazer. The Stargazer is a previously unseen type of starship which was pretty cool. The episodes story is OK which deals not only with Picard's past but with Ferengi (sp) as well. Not bad for the first season.
5,Cristal D;Arques Longchamp Tumbler,Recipient of gift was thrilled as was I. This company has the most perfectly made crystal that I have ever seen; absolutely flawless.
4,a fine addition,"I had 10 of these tumblers which I purchased in 1982. I needed additional glasses for Thanksgiving dinner. They are not quite as heavy a cut glass as the ones I purchased 30 years ago, but in appearance they were a perfect match."
3,Inexpensive crystal for everyday use.,"I bought a set of flutes, goblets, wine glasses, oldfashioned, and highball glasses. The wine glasses and goblets had the characteristic ringing sound of crystal, but the others did not. However the glass/crystal itself had the same clear transparency. All the glasses had a tab saying that they had greater than 24% lead (crystal). They all come in practical standard sizes.They do not have the feel of expensive crystal, but they are good for the price and everyday use."
1,CRISTAL D'ARC,"Cristal D'Arques Longchamp 11-3/4-Ounce Crystal Iced-Tea Glass, Set of 4I never received my purchase. I did recrive ONE glass sent after christmas, but we did not ever get the order I place which was for two sets of four glasses. I suggest you drop this company. I give them NO STARS."
5,Love these glasses,This is a third or fouth purchase of these glasses. Just needed more. Love them. They are elegant looking and yet sturdy. A good everyday or fancy glass.
3,IR 236 review,"I received the IR 236 today. It looks ok but contains no operating instructions or manual. I went on line to see if they exists and were just omitted from my box by mistake but that is not the case. The IR website has none for this particular model. Maybe it is because this is a new model. For a $100 tool, there should be operating and maintenance instructions. This tool comes with zero. Since it is an air tool and proper lubrication is critical to long life, recommended maintenance is important. It has what appears to two settings for tightening and loosening but who knows for sure or what torque range is applicable to each. Trouble shooting guide for problems later is important too. Tool is also made in China which I did not know up front. I hate most everything that comes from China. IR was not helpful with my requests for operating info on this tool so support does not look promising. Tool may be great but it is not what I expected for a $100. I think it is going back."
4,Often fascianting reading,"This dual biography of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, published in 1979, is a gossipy journalistic account, not very well footnoted but full of judgments, mostly adverse to the Duke and Duchess. The account of the time up to the abdication on Dec 11, 1936, is super interesting, even though I did on Jan 3, 1982 read Abdication by Brian Inglis, and so some of the story was familiar. The lives of the couple after their marriage are less interesting, and the great detail as to their possessions and social life does get tiresome. The book ends before the Duchess dies, though she was physically and mentally in bad shape when the book ends.."
5,The windsor story,"I enjoy history and found this book to be wonderful. I had the book once before and lost it in a move so I was glad to find that it was offered here. It goes into great detail and after knowing the story of ""Bertie"" and book is even more informative. Thank you for the great book for my library"
4,The Windsor Story,"What an extensive book. Well researched and well written. If you want to know about the Windsors, I would definitely recommend reading this."
5,educational,this DVD is very educational. Perfect for the flamenco dancing and musci student. One learns things about the genre that takes years to learn/understand in the classroom setting.
2,corrupt dvd,dvd is corrupt and starts to hang half way onwards. Very dissapointing after spending so much the product quality is not upto the mark. Did not expect this from amazon.
1,NO help at all,ok when i started using this something felt fishy about it then realized its just coco butter in a smaller bottle but for more its a waste of money people
4,Decent Results,"I have been using this product in conjunction with the Philosophy Hope in a Tube for Eyes/Lips. When I bought (and later returned in exchange for this generic product) the more expensive name brand eye product, the woman at Macy's said I would still need an additional eye cream to moisturize. I agree that the same is needed for this product, which is why I also use the philosophy.I did notice a slight brightening of my under eye circles, although not to the point that I could stop wearing concealer during the week. I also saw a slight disappearance of the fine lines underneath my lower lashes.I will continue to use this and the Philosophy product. It is much better than anything I've ever used from the drugstore, and better than the shiseido eye cream I was using religiously for the past 3 years."
2,"nice, but didn't work for me","I like the way this product feels on my face; however, after 60 days of using it there was no improvement for me. In fact, I think it made the dark circles worse by spreading them out more. I took before and after pictures so I could very the results. Perhaps it works for someone else. I think there is no one product that will solve the dark circle procuct for everybody. We all have different reasons for the issue. So I will have to keep searching for something that works for me."
1,Doesn't work,"This product produced absolutely NO results in my under-eye dark circles. I used it faithfully for 3 weeks on the right eye, just to see if there would be a difference. In the end both eyes remained the same. No change whatsoever."
2,"Eh, it's ok","I tried the Under EyeBryten for 4.5 weeks. The skin under my eyes does appear more supple, and the dark color mid-eye outward has decreased to an extent. However, the dark color mid-eye to inner only lightened slightly, and not satisfactorily. (I never had a problem with puffiness around the eye) I am still in search of a product that adaquately decreases/prevents dark under eye circles :-("
1,Don't waste your money,This product did absolutely nothing for the puffiness around my eyes. I had much better results with a generic version of Strivectin-D for eyes.I don't have dark circles (thankfully) so I can't address that aspect.
4,better than most of other products,"I have been using Eyebryten for about 5 weeks for the dark circle under my eyes and it worked pretty good. I used lots of different products, ranging from $10 o $25, before using Eyebryten and this has been the best one.Do not expect this product take away dark circles totally, but It reduces the appearance of it about very much."
1,WHERE is the Eyeliss??,"This product claims to have Eyeliss. I see it in the product discription and can see it in the product graphic noted. I rec'd mine yesterday and to my surprise, no mention of Eyeliss anywhere on package or on the bottle. Strange.... I have used this 3 times as directed with NO visible results. Very dissappointed. So far Vita-K is THE BEST product out there. It tightens the skin around your eyes within 30 seconds of application and lasts all day. My only problem with Vita-K is that after prolonged use, my eye lids twitch! Not cool. Stopped using although doc says it is nothing to worry about - just an irritant."
2,just another .99 cent cream,I used this for over 2 months and saw no changes in my dark under eye circles. I know it's hereditary and there is probably no cream in the world that can change that so i blame myself for even thinking a cream could work.
5,Worked for me.,"The best one of these products I ever used is Teamine, but it is LUMINESCENT under black lights, which are EVERYWHERE. So I quit using it. this is a close second. I notice if I live healthy, it works better. some light cardio and/or yoga and the puffiness and dark circles around my eyes are more amenable to treatment.Wish it was a LITTLE less expensive, but a bottle lasted me a friggin year, so what am I complaining about?"
2,EyeBryten,Tried this product for a month now and still no results...I feel like I have wasted my money.
1,Doesn't do anything,"I don't have any puffiness, the skin is very thin under my eyes. I have darkness there - this stuff doesn't help at all."
3,this product helps,I have suffered from severe dark circles since i was a child This product does not completely get rid of dark circles but it doesmake them alot lighter. you must keep using it or they will return as soon as you stop. i have tried other products that did not work at all soa 50% improvement is better than nothing the price is worth it.
2,does it help?,"I did not notice an improvement with this product. I have been using it as per directions, I guess I am just one of those people that this product will not help. Yes, I am disappointed, but Eyebryten may work for somebody else. I would not discount the manufacturer claims...I just may have a genetic trend that does not respond to this treatment."
4,Reduces fine lines,I have been using this product for one month and it really does reduced the fine lines under my eyes. Concealer goes on much smoother. I have hereditary dark under eye circles and I can't say they have changed much; maybe a little. But I will continue using this product and hope for the best. It is chock full of ingredients that are suppose to thicken your skin by increasing collagen levels so eventually the circles may lighten even more. These things take time and I don't think there is any other product out there (except the produt this one copies at a fraction of the price)that will work any better.
2,"Under EyeBryten Severe Dark Circles and Under-Eye Puffiness Formula, 1 oz (30 ml)","Did not work for me that much. Puffiness did go away significantly, maybe just a little, that is all. Dark circles are still there after using the product for almost a month."
3,Under EYEBRYTEN,"Like most products it does absolutely nothing for dark circles, but it is a great moisturizer.If you are serious about improving your dark circles and can spend a few $$$, have a good practitioner use a CO2 laser in your undereye area. I had it done for creases under my eyes, which it helped a little. The improving of my dark circles was an unexpected benefit!"
5,Best of Nioxin for us!,INERGY by Nioxin is our favorite Nioxin shampoo! We were losing handfuls of hair with each shower before Nioxin and now it's staying on the heads for the most part. Thanks for the great shampoo.
4,Magical but be Forewarned,"There are two versions of this movie, one rated and one unrated. For children and the young at heart the rated version is a sweet fairy tale, with the charming and and singularly gorgeous Ami Dolenz at the story's center. She is a well-meaning but not so good genie who is on her last chance to help a hapless human. He is rather a simpleton, wanting to use her powers to help him land his fantasy girl, a self-absored TV advertising model. But causing a person to fall in love is the one power genies cannot provide. Along the way, our genie falls in love with the goofy but earnest young man. And he, at last, finally realizes this, providing the classic happy ending. BUT BE FOREWARNED, the unrated version adds numerous gratuitous scenes of topless and g-string babes, turning the film into yet another of that genre and definitely not for those under 18 even with parents present."
5,mriacle beach .. this is good movie funny,this is babyangel.. im from califroina. i would like to speak whosever about make a movie on dvd for miracle beach plus caption closed please.. you can do it for put caption closed with in dvd (miracle beach) please you can make a movie on dvd more than vhs.. dvd is more good clear.. thanks dont wait so long. just short coming in dvd as soon. thanks
3,Not too hard for a UFC fighter,"It not bad, I just expected something better. The exercises are nothing new or challenging but might be ok for a beginner. GSP is the man an excellent fighter. Nothing against him I hope this doesn't represent him and what he does to prepare for a fight."
3,A light workout for beginners,"I've done both P90X and Insanity, both of which I think are way harder (especially Insanity) and more intense. I bought the entire Rushfit set, and did 3 of the workouts before selling it on eBay. I thought the workouts were too light and were a waste of time. If your level of fitness is zero, then this workout will help you build a foundation. If you've done P90x or Insanity and are looking for something at the same intensity level, save your money and don't buy this."
3,Not impressed,"I can only speak for the strenght and endurance workout dvd, but it was a major let down. The routine is very good but so basic,one minute of squats? one minute of push-ups? Too basic for me. I was expecting something more along the lines of ""Training for Warriors"""
3,Good video,"The workout portion of the video is very good. Georges is a bit difficult to understand at times, and he is pretty ""wooden"" as a spokesperson, but the workout itself is definitely demanding; even Georges is breathing heavily at times. Really that is my only peeve with this video, but since I notice it, it detracts from my workout a bit. I have several other DVDs that I follow more often than this one."
5,tough workout,"good workout. not undoable, but hard enough to knowyouve had a good work out. you may not make it through it the1st time, but by the 5th time you get the rythum"
2,Snooze...,"I thought this was boring and not too challenging. I was surprised it wasn't more difficult. I expected to be sweating buckets. I found it slow and almost annoying. I think what was annoying was the trainer kept talking and fast. I felt like he would make an excellent sales person. John St. Pierre was not too motivating and appeared to struggle with some moves that I found not too complicated. He was also quite negative. The trainer kept asking him how an excercise was for him and he repeatedly said terrible. It's not a workout dvd that I plan on using again in the near future. Although, maybe for a change every two to three months I might toss it in the dvd player. I will probably quickly realize why it has dust on it after a few minutes into the workout."
5,Top Notch!,"Great workout DVD!PROS:Functional MovementsHigh IntensityGood InstructionWeights + Body Weight TrainingWarm-up & Cool-down/StretchingCONS:GSP can be hard to understand at timesIt isn't always clear what weight to useI think this is a great workout at a great price. Well worth the money! You get out what you put into this, just like any workout and just like most things in life. If the workout is too hard you can hit pause and catch your breath. If it's too easy, like one reviewer wrote, then kick up the intensity or grab a heavier weight. GSP is one of the best conditioned athletes on the planet. If he can get a good workout from this DVD then so can you!"
5,Great hand cream,I love this hand cream. Basically no smell (and I am sensitive to smells) and really helps dry hands. I use it once or twice a day - especially in winter and do not get the cracking skin like I used to get.
1,What a waste of time!,"Watched this DVD with great interest having a bit of knowledge of the old story it was based on. I know it is an old movie and Greeks had a great pride in their conquests but for this movie, it's better with the Greeks left out of it and don't bother buying this movie. I would rate it as less than one star."
3,Interestiong but slow paced,"I am not someone who needs explosions and car chases so when I say the movie is slow it is because the director purposely has paced it that way. The movie is black and white and I love that. It takes place in Ancient Greece, when I am not certain, but a lot of characters still wear animal skins. While others (I assume the more well off) wear woven fabric.If you are looking for a sexy film, this is not it. Dialog is in Greek (as it was made in Greece) with English subtitles."
3,Unpleasant and Strange,"For anyone looking for a classical love story in a romantic setting, be advised, the young couple are living amidst some really crude unpleasant men doing strange things for almost incomprehensible reasons. The b and w renders the scenery as over baked and it is filmed in such a way as to make everyone seem short and in need of a bath. The girl manages throughout to be stunning, so perhaps for that reason, alone, the video is worth a look. A strange sad period piece."
3,Poor plot.,Boy meets girl...The plot is hard to follow. I'm not sure what the plot was all about. I don't think there was much Greek cultureinvolved.
1,Not as listed,"Beware. This album is a later release from the National Lampoon and does not feature Belushi, Chase or Chris Guest. The comic artists are unknowns. You may still find it funny. I didn't."
3,Re Read Again After 40 Years,"I read this book when I was 14 years old when it first came out in 1972. My 15 year old sister gave it to me to read after she had read it. I've read a lot of the comments on here about the rape in this book. Now at 14 I might not had really understood the rape part but today at 54 years old I do. I'd like to comment on it after reading the book again. At first Brandon thought Heather was a prostitute (because she came to his ship freely and didn't put up a fight) so it wasn't rape to him. He was just satisfying his male urges. But once he knew she wasn't a prostitute and a virgin and he kept doing it, to me that's rape. The rest of the book was good to me and I enjoyed reading it again after all these years with older eyes. I guess back in 1799 women were like Heather and had to obey and listen to their husbands. Thank god we're not like that today."
1,This book disgusted me.,"I cannot say enough bad things about this book. It is disgusting, and I hated both of the characters. The heroine is a weak-minded fool who falls in love with her rapist, and the hero IS her rapist. And no, the time and the era does NOT justify what he did to her. The definition of rape is when one of the partners is unwilling - and I can remember Heather very clearly protesting. And when she becomes pregnant, Brandon actually has the gall to be upset with her. And not only that, but after they are married and Heather is too traumatized to make love due to her horrible first sexual encounter, Brandon tells himself that he will have her anyway - even if it comes to rape. So there you have it. The man is a rapist and a disgusting person in general. Certainly not a guy to fall in love with, or even like."
1,counselor in CA,"This is one of the worst romances I've read. I could only read about 50 pages. Brandon rapes her ( a few times) and she's supposed to fall in love with him. After she tells him she's not a streetwalker (after the intial rape scene), he tells her he will make her his mistress againest her will. This man has no morals, conscience, or any redeming qualities that I could see. Women DO NOT fall in love with men who rape them and treat them so poorly."
1,So Bad it Borders on Criminal,"Ditto what other reviewers wrote about how horrible this book is. For those reviewers who liked this book, most cite the time period in which the book was written, the 1970s, as justifying it. It's like, ""Oh, they liked bodice-rippers back then."" Maybe it's just me, but I don't get it. Are they saying that repeated rape was not only ok buy desirable in the 70s? (We're not talking seduction, but forcible, brutal rape over and over.) I was so turned off by this behavior on the part of the ""hero"" I was sickened. But the heroine falls in love with him?! How may women whose first introduction to sex was forcible rape suddenly fall in love with and sexually desire the rapist? I don't know how this author could conceive and pass off such horror as romance!"
2,Not for me,"Brandon is an angry, selfish, almost abusive man for much of the book. Heather is not just naive, she's cowardly and foolish. By the end of the book, I liked them okay, but it took a very long time, and they'll never be anything close to my favorite characters.The multiple rapes at the beginning of the book just got the whole thing off on the wrong foot. Even 2/3 of the way through the book, Brandon had few qualms about possibly repeating the act. And Heather, by the time the villain showed up, should have trusted Brandon to protect, but oh, no. And the reader is never convinved of her reasoning.The book is too long, the dialogue often ridiculously flowery, and the exposition generally a drag on the movement of the plot. In a way, I'd like to read the sequel, That Elusive Flame, but I'm not sure I can handle it. This book has its moments, but I find the writing to be very uneven. It's just not for me."
1,Rape is Romantic?,"Rape is rape no matter how you put it, whether it be wrapped up in a gorgeous wealthy sea captain or in gutter swine. I read this book because it is considered to be such a classic in romance. I don't get it. I felt nothing but sorry for Heather the entire book and hated Brandon. The ending was awful when they laugh about how it all ended well even if it started with a rape. Since when did rape become romantic? This book was not my cup of tea."
5,this is what started it all,"i read this book in seventh grade and would reread it all through middle and high school. along the way, i lost my infatuation with romance novels. just rediscovered this on my kindle and still, 30 plus years later, could not put it down. i loved this novel for the character development and the way the romance built with time.i am unsure why the initial sequence of events bothers so many women. the author clearly implies that it was a mistake and misunderstanding on both character's parts. you never get a sense beyond those initial scenes that brandon is anything less than honourable.i look at this book as escapist fiction and beautifully written escapist fiction, at that.one of my all time favorites."
1,tedious to say the least,"Wow this book was a drag to read. The characters barley spoke to each other. No witty banter, hardly any conversation at all. Absolutely no chemistry...I skimmed most the book b/c it was so boring. Never reading another book from this author"
1,So dissapointed,"Usually, I am not a picky reader, but this book was unbearable. The forced dialogue, the language, and the imagery made it impossible to connect with the characters. Woodwiss, instead of using ""naught"" to mean nothing, decided to use it to mean ""not"". This, among other things, made me put down the book without finishing it. I could not bring myself to waste anymore time reading its useless, shallow text."
1,Time period is no excuse . . .,"for being a rapist. The hero is so uncaring, so cruel, so downright evil that this novel falls firmly in the ""Did Not Finish"" category for me. You tell me he's redeemed at the end? I'd rather see him drawn and quartered. Heather should kill the bastard in his sleep--now THAT would be a happy ending. He ""stole"" her virginity, so he ""pays"" for it by marrying her, so now they're even? Oh goody, her reward for being raped is having the privilege of being his property for as long as they both shall live. At least whores can choose their johns. This isn't a romance, it's horror. Thank heavens that romances aren't (for the most part) like this anymore."
2,Wow O__o,"Read in 2005:It was a page turner, but not in a good way. I wanted to see just how more jaw-droppingly offensive it could get. Still, I kept in mind that it was Exhibit A of the old skool bodice-ripper genre with a dirtbag Alpha Male hero & a Too Stupid To Live doormat heroine. It was...interesting. I'll give it that. But not arousing or romantic in the slightest.However, I was laid up in bed with massive back pain and the agony was transferred to the eyes & brain while reading it, so it was beneficial in a way.ETA 2/22/10: This was my first reacquaintance with the true bodice-ripping genre in quite a few years. I have since read more in the last couple months and found them very enjoyable, if not superior to many modern romances. TF&TF; is going back on the TBR and I'm sure that my opinion will change. So no negative votes, please!"
5,Unforgettable!,"I was absolutely taken away with _The Flame and the Flower_! I was so intrigued by her specific detail of the characters. Also, with romance, mystery, and murder combined into one novel, what more could one ask for? Page turing, heart warming, and truly unforgettable! I wanted, so desperately, for the story to continue with Brandon and Heather's love. Don't miss this book!"
2,Not for me,"It feels a little sacrilegious to not like the Flame and the Flower, since it set the bar for so many romance readers back in the '70s. What can I say? I just didn't like it. I thought the heroine was just another wimpy goody goody. The hero was a little too father-figure for my taste."
2,Unbelievable but Intriguing,"Being a teenager of 17 myself, I could understand Heather to a certain degree. Being scared, running for your life, and having no one to turn to could make anyone scared. Heather was a child, like me in a lot of ways. She was terrified and being ravaged by a 35 year old man made it no better. I cried along with her. Brandon was infuriating, much like my own paramour (even though he is my age!) always teasing her. Heather was at times though, over sensitive. At least, a good part of the time, she was not afraid to be herself with Brandon. That I had to admire. And when he saw her with baby Beau, that melted my heart. He grew in the novel, and like many of us, he decided that while pride may last for a few years, true love lasts for ever."
1,Zero Stars,"That's what I would give this one if the rating system permitted. The so-called ""hero"" repeatedly rapes the heroine, even after he figures out she was an innocent, not a prostitute (not that I think raping a prostitute is ok either, but you get my drift here). Then she ends up falling in love with him? Yeah, so he's a real SOB and brutalizes her, but hey, he's ""handsome"". Give me a break! I failed to find the ""romance"" in this piece of trash. DON'T waste your time on it!"
1,Not worth the price of admission,"I never read the book, but listened to the abridged audiotape - it had no depth - I would not buy another of her abridged audiotapes."
4,Good book.,"Great book, great author, would highly recommend for anyone looking for a historical romance novel. I was not disappointed, and you won't be either."
4,good read,"I would have liked this book more if people would have stopped ripping off Heather's clothes every few sentences to get a look at the perfect body that the devil had gifted her with. Brandon is hard to like at times (most times) but in the end, I still couldn't put the book down."
5,One of the best romance novels ever written!,"The Flame and the Flower was the first novel by Kathleen E. Woodiwiss that I read and she had me hooked in the first chapter. For me, Captain Brandon Birmingham is ""THE MAN""! He is the standard against which I judge all the other romance novel leading male characters. On my scale, he's a ""10"". This novel is a real classic not to be missed by any true romance novel fans. My only regret is that I didn't read it sooner. I've read about 7 of Kathleen E. Woodiwiss' novels in the last 6 months and they have all been great stories."
3,The flame and the flower kindle edition,"Found some typo,s in the kindle edition. Do all the ebooks have typos, or just amazon? Dont know if I will purchase the book since I was only reading a sample that already had typos"
3,Not outstanding.. but not bad,This is the first book by this author that I have read. I can tell you I am not overly impressed. I have read better (I love Lindsey). The author was able to keep my attention because I was hoping the next page would show a difference between the two main characters. There isn't alot of sexual situations in this book... I don't know if this is good or bad.... but I will not rule this author out because of this book either. I have to be fair and try her other works before I say NO to her.
3,Too long!,"This book was just too long. Towards the middle, the book seemed to slow down and I began to lose interest in the characters. The rape scene was bothersome. Equally bothersome is the fact that Brandon didn't even feel an ounce of remorse for his actions and yet, had the audacity to blame Heather for forcing him into the marriage. Heather had no backbone and seemed to back off every time they had a confrontation. As a heroine, she was disappointing."
2,"If you want to read it, check it out from the library!","Woodiwiss has produced a well-written book with a disturbing plot line. After reading the ""rape"" scene, I found myself thinking there is no difference between Brandon's character and her aunt's brother, except looks and the fact that Brandon was able to rape her first.Throughout the book, Brandon continues to treat Heather badly. Woodiwiss does not build enough justification for how Heather could possibly fall in love with Brandon, since he treats her poorly.If an author wishes to write a rape scene in a novel, she must be careful how she carries it off. When Woodiwiss wishes to do so next, she should look at Judith McNaught's book, Whitney My Love for an example."
1,What romance is not!,"I am a romance writter, myself, and I have to say that if I wrote this peice of garbage, I would hang my head in shame! The idea that this book is still being published as a romance disgusts me.To all the ladies who have reviewed this book and given it a two star rating or higher, I have to ask you, what would you do if Brandon did this to YOUR 17 year old daughter?It's a sad day when women give good reviews to books that promote violence against women. And I don't give a darn that this was written in a time where 'bodice rippers' were the thing. We are living in an 'enlightned' age now, 2003 even, and there are still women out there that are saying that this is the best romance they had ever read! To those women I have one peace of advice: Go to a book store and get another book!!"
5,captivating,just finished re-reading it for the third time. I love Brandon and Heather and wished they gotten things right quicker. One of Woodiwiss best.
5,Woodiwiss rules Romance!,"This book, and Ashes in the Wind, are two of my all-time favorite novels! I've read this one at least five times, and I never tire of reading it! When I want to lose myself in romance, this is the book to pick up and read! Brandon Birmingham is one of my favorite literary characters, and he sets the bar high for romantic heroes!"
4,As a first time reader,"As a first time reader the book was well written. I love historical romance and the issues it entails. I liked how possessive Brandon was with Heather from the beginning. His loyalty and faithfulness to Heather was refreshing considering he only slept with her one night. Their nemesis Louisa which was Brandon 's ex-fiancee spiteful comments were believable. However, I gave it a 4 star because was way to meek and shy for my taste. She needs backbone to handle a handsome rugged hunk like Brandon. Although, I'll give Heather credit for getting one in the end. Also, I think Kew could of expanded on the sex scenes instead of starting with he kissed her neck with heart beating fast then ending it there. So for you reader's out there if your into romance with a plot and adventure this will be a good read. But if you looking dreamy love scenes forget it look some where else."
2,Mixed Bag,"This was one of the first romance novels that I ever read and it immediately became one of my favorites. I reread it recently and found that it did not age well. The rape scene in the beginning is extremely disturbing, as is the fact that the hero never acknowledges how horrible his actions were. The vast age difference between the characters is also troublesome.The book is well written, but be warned that it is full of 70's romance purple prose. If you want to read a Woodiwiss, I would suggest The Wolf and the Dove and skip this one."
2,Didn't Like It,"Well, I was bored. I couldn't connect with the characters, I found it hard to finish. I didn't finish this book with good feelings for the characters like I usually do with a romance book. I found Brandon's temper disturbing, he is very mean and cruel to Heather, reminded me of an abusive relationship I was in. I don't think the rape scene was necessary, it was to violent. I wouldn't recommend anyone who hasn't read this story, to bother. I hope this isn't a sign of things to come from Kathleen Woodiwiss. I actually wondered while reading this story if it was even written by her! Seriously! This story did evoke some emotions......but unfortunetly none of them were good."
2,This book is extremely disturbing...,"I agree totally with the reader from Portland Oregon. The book was very disturbing throughout the entire beginning and again at the end with rapes,abuse and murder. It isn't much of a romance unless you just read the middle, which was boring."
1,When did Raping a woman become romantic!,"This book is utterly disturbing and disgusting not only does the ""hero"" of the novel rape her, he is emotionally abusive and likes to see her cower... not only does the author make this seem OK she romanticizes it and glorifies it! UGH!If I could give lower than one star I would!"
4,The Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary,"A good reference work that settles disputes quickly. Perhaps my used edition is a little outdated, but hell, so am I.LB"
2,not very effective,I was excited about this and thought the quality would be superb but it's not very effective and really dried out my skin. It also smells very strong. I probably will not order again.
1,Too harsh - denatured alcohol is one of the first ingredients,"Though these correction pads have some good ingredients, this product strips the skin - which can cause a rebound effect of even more oiliness. When denatured alcohol is one of the first five ingredients (ingredients are listed by amount, with the first ingredients comprising the highest % of the product) don't buy it. I get better results from MD Alpha Beta pads. It has a LOT less alcohol in it. It's ingredients are:Ingredients: Salicylic Acid, Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Extract, Citric Acid, Copper PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Glycolic Acid, Camellia Sinensis Extract, Lactic Acid, Malic Acid, Polysorbate-20, Water, Alcohol Denat., Sodium Benzoate, Soy Isoflavones, Genestein, Hamamelis Virginiana, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Zinc PCA"
1,Terrible for my skin,"I used this for two weeks, and then my skin had a break out of tiny bumps, after this reaction my skin was peeling for 3 weeks!!! :("
3,"Good product, depending on the seller","Very good product, for face and other problem areas.... my face rarely gets pimples but other body parts do (very embarrassing!) I have tried everything - for over 20 years - and this is the first product to eradicate body-pimples completely.However - -be careful who you buy them from - I have gotten products that seemed like they had been replaced with stridex pads. The PTR pads should NOT smell like alcohol - the scent is very nice. I trust Payless Beauty and Flex Commerce - their products always arrive sealed and smelling the way they should!"
5,I love it,"The Peter THomas Roth Max compexion correction pads are a perfect product for people of any age group that suffer from small break outs to more severe acne. It stings a bit on the skin, but keeps blemishes under control and clears them in no time. Ideal for home and travel as long as the lid is kept tightly secured so that the pads cannot dry up. I give this product several thumbs up! Also, I found that purchasing this product through Amazon was cheaper than from other sources."
3,eh.,"I love this product, always have and I was happy to see that the price is lower here on amazon rather than at sephore where it is more pricey. The item shipped on time and everything but it had clearly already been opened. Everything was inside and it seemed to look like someone tried to cover up that they had already opened it. Whatever the product is the same so I just peeled off the first two pads and used the rest! They hadn't been used or anything, you would definately be able to tell. Great product! Fast shipping just sad that it was already opened."
4,Nice product,My first time with Peter Thomas Roth product. It's as described. Not really drying like most pads. It was super wet so I added some dry Cotton pads and that worked great to stretch the product out too!
3,Complexion Pads,"Great product. It makes the skin tingle like it should but it doesn't dry the skin out very much. Still, I wished it didn't have so much alcohol in it. It irritates my eyes when I come near it."
2,Not Worth the price,"I have troubled acne and i was expecting this product to improve this condition somewhat as it is by a highly respected product line and sold at one of the leading beauty retailers. Also, I am stuck on the ""you get what you pay for kick"" and i believed that since this product had a moderate to expensive price tag, that it would be much more effective. Unfortunately i was not pleased. The product caused excessive dryness and after I used the product for about 50 days, there was no improvement in my complexion. Instead of paying $36.50, I think you will gain the same result by purchasing some Oxy or Stridex pads in the drug store for about a fourth of the price."
3,Too strong.,These work great on acne but they're way too strong. I prefer the gentle version of this product. It really dried my skin out too much. I won't buy this version again. I'll stick to the gentle version.
4,Astonishing,"hello readers this book is worth buying ,because it has all the lessons that a marine engineer would need to trouble shoot the problems they face on board the vessel.This book is very useful for the seagoing personnel as well as the students who are studying the marine engineering or marine related course.It makes everything clear from the operators standpoint.I suggest all you mariners(engineers&technicians)to buy this book ."
5,Kathleen Byron-Wow!,"This is a great movie for those who admire well-made films. I am a big fan of the Pressburger-Powell collaborations and only wish all of them were available (Colonel Blimp where are you?). Kathleen Byron is remarkable for her portrayal of a woman besieged by mortal concupiscence. Something tells me Mr. Spielberg thought so to since he cast her as Mrs. James Ryan in ""Saving Private Ryan"". I wish we would see her more often on screen."
5,Watch at your own risk--it may keep you awake!,"Excellent though the cast is in general, it's Kathleen Byron who steals the picture as Sister Ruth, one of filmdom's all-time great nutcases. This performance had to have influenced Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard and Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction--in fact, you might even notice an oh-so-subtle parallel in Kathy Bates's Oscar-winning performance in Misery. The beautifully designed sets and fabulous camera work add to the strange, unhealthy atmosphere of the harem-turned-convent setting--as Mr. Dean puts it, ""It's no place for a nunnery!"""
3,Very interesting,"If you are a Deborah Kerr fan, you'll like this dark film. Made in 1947, the film tells the story of a nun who failed in her efforts to establish a school and hospital in the Himalayas due to conflicting and sinister personalities. The scenery is great, but the editing is awful."
3,"Good Blu-Ray, but not all features work on North America players","I own this UK import. The movie itself is region free and does indeed work on North American Blu-Ray players; however, the featurette ""A Profile of Black Narcissus"" is presented in standard-def PAL (on the same BR disc as the HD feature), and is not playable on most US BR machines.So, if you are only interested in the main feature (which does like quite nice in HD) and don't mind being somewhat ripped off in the extra features department, go for it. It wouldn't surprise me to see Criterion eventually release a Region A Blu-Ray edition of this stateside, however."
5,Must Own Blu-Ray - Film As Art,"Length:: 2:01 MinsHi I'm Lou, I hope you find my video review of the blu-ray Criterion edition of ""Black Narcissus"" helpful."
5,Haunting eroticism high in the Himalayas,"A group of nuns is invited to take over an abandoned remote retreat in the Himalayas. There they must learn to deal with: the native population, a cynical British agent, and their own inadequacies. Mainly the movie centers around the sexual feelings Deborah Kerr and Kathleen Byron have for the British agent David Farrar. The erotoc tensions build precipitously, thanks to the native drumbeats, the endless wind, and the award-winning color photography of the breathtaking Himalayan setting(though it was filmed in a studio). The use of flashbacks to earlier days before joining the order for each of the nuns effectively heightens their inner conflicts. It's a well-acted, intelligent, and highly emotional movie - well worth a watch."
5,Black Narcissus,"Another great success for ""Red Shoes"" helmers Powell-Pressburger, ""Narcissus"" is an absorbing, finely acted British melodrama about the secular problems facing a new mother superior in an unfamiliar, potentially hostile new environment. The directors even stirred controversy by developing a subtle yet credible sexual tension between the luminous Kerr and hunky Farrar. Jack Cardiff's Oscar-winning Technicolor photography and Alfred Junge's hand-crafted art design give this film exceptional production values to boot. And Kathleen Byron's celebrated turn as the unhinged Sister Ruth climaxes in a suspenseful sequence that's hard to forget."
4,CONFLICTS,"THE STORY SEEMED REALLY TWISTING TO ME, BUT THE CINEMATOGRAPHY LOOKED WONDERFUL, AND DEBORAH WAS SO BEAUTIFUL...LIKE A ROSE ON A PLAIN. CONFLICTS AMONG HUMAN HAS BEEN AN ETERNAL THEME OF FILM-MAKING."
3,Not the Criteorion version,"Beware that this is NOT a Criterion version, so it is lacking all the DVD versions PLUS its 4 minutes shorter than the DVD. The quality is also not that much better than the DVD"
5,"Oh, what a tangled web we weave . . .","I love it when I have no idea where a book is going, which in a case like this is only possible if you don't read the blurb on the dust jacket. Stephen King's recommendation of the author persuaded me that the trip would be worthwhile, and it certainly was. Interesting characters, nail-biting suspense, and clever parallels among very different people - some smart, some terminally stupid - as they attempt to put Nietzsche's philosophy into practical use. A winner!"
1,Don't Bother!,"I have been a fan of Peter Abrahams since his first book, The Fury of Rachel Monette, and for the most part have enjoyed all of his books. Unfortunately I am sorry that I spent time reading his newest title, Crying Wolf. By the middle of this book, I was tired of the innocence of the freshman and left cold by the twins. I found myself seriously skimming to get to the end and be finished with it.If you still are interested in reading a good novel set on a college campus which is a good psychological thriller, then pick up Paullina Simons title from a few years ago called Red Leaves."
2,My first Peter Abrahams Book.,"I wasn't sure I was going to pick this book, but, when I saw ""My favorite American suspense novelist"" -Stephen King on the cover, I decided to give it a try. The only reason I finished the book was because I took the time to start it. If I had to describe the book in one word, I would say, shallow. Don't waste your time or money. There are so many wonderful books out there. This does not happen to be one of them."
2,Sophomores will like this...,"...if they are still in high school, that is, but h.s. juniors will laugh out loud at how naive and pretentious this book is. Too bad; it had a strong finish, the fell apart rapidly. Only gets two stars because it is well written in parts and moves smartly along. Far too many coincidences, a cariacature philosophy professor (reads like a bad term paper on Nietzche in places) and a cliche-riden middle-aged leftover hippie townie, full of a nice middle-class boy's wholly imaginary idea of how rich people live (buy a copy of ""Town and Country"" if you really want to know). A silly book, much worse than his earlier ""The Fan"" which was great. A major disappointment. Omit."
2,A disappointment,"This book was a major disappointment that needed the hand of a firm editor. The first two-thirds of the book were all background leading up to the hatching of the""dastardly deed."" I like a thriller that grabs me on the first page, preferably in the first paragraph. I kept reading this book hoping that the pace would pick up, but it never did. Abrahams is a talented writer, but this story went nowhere and should not be classified as a thriller. I felt it was a waste of time and money."
3,Nietzche and college..,"Abrahams's ""Crying Wolf"" is the story of a college student with a feminine name who is just trying to be somebody. Life interferes, and he finds he has to make a few choices, fraught with folly. To help him are his friends, two sisters who are identical twins. The plan: fake a kidnapping, so the hero can stay in school. It was a noble plan, but someone decides to make it real to achieve his own ends. The villian is unusual, a dumb poolboy named after Nietzsche whose father never knew of his existence. Interesting themes, and operatic in tradegy."
3,"Promising start, weak ending","This doesn't read like a typical suspense novel. In fact, it isn't ""suspenseful"" at all until the last 50 pages. That's fine with me and actually made me like it more. However, the suspenseful part was garbage. It was too rushed and seemed thrown together. It's a shame because I really enjoyed the character building and the premise of the book. I liked Ned, the main character, and his two partners in crime and could sympathize with them. I also REALLY liked how it was narrated in parts from the bad guy's perspective. Like I said, though, the end ruined it for me and made all the build-up feel like a waste."
2,I Got Thru It,"I got thru the book which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. The writing was not polished, very fragmented. It was easy to figure out the ending before reading it. I was not impressed with this book. Save your time & money for something better."
3,Disappointing,"This was the first Peter Abrahams book I read and I felt misled by the build up he had from Stephen King.True, the plot was diverting - even entertaining. But, far too many coincidences. Too predictable. Is it possible for a lad - even one from the midwest - to be as naive as Nate is painted?Still, I won't give up on the author on the basis of one book."
2,BORING...,"What a disappointment. I'm sorry I spent the time reading it. I hoped it would get better. Stephen King, what are you thinking?"
3,"Nail Biting-- Not... But, a good story line.","I thought that this book was going to be a nail biter, a real suspense thriller, boy was I wrong. Stephen King needs to get out a little more. The characterization was done well and I grew to like them. The story line was pretty good and there were possibilities, unfortunately, Mr. Abrahams did not take advantage of them. The ending falls short and leaves the reader wanting so much more. It is a fun book, but not much more."
1,Very disappointing,"I picked up this book because Stephen King claimed how Abrahams was one of the best suspense writers. Man, was I disappointed. This story has no substance, hollow characters, and an unsatisfying ending. I am stunned that some critics wrote favorably about this book. For shame."
2,A bit dissapointing,"I have read most of Peter Abrahams' books and was so excited to have this newest work to read. While he is still a good writer, this is not one his best. This is not a book that I checked out of the library after being on a waiting list and was glad I did not purchase it."
5,Great Book,"This was a good Thriller and I loved all the charcters and the way it switched between Nat and the twins and Freedy, the dirty criminal was great. I love books about college and this was one of them."
1,Crying Wolf is just a bad book.,"I'm not going to pretend to be an educated, experienced critic, but like 95% of you out there I enjoy a good book. Crying Wolf is not a good book. Abrahams stumbles through the story almost as though he has put the first draft out there! At times it is almost painful to battle through. He continues to ask me questions and then answers them for me in the next sentence or paragraph. Mr. Abrahams, please please, let me, the reader, ask my own questions! The characters, especially Freedy, are terribly inconsistent and poorly brought together. Like 95% of you out there I don't want to waste time and I'm sorry I did on this book. With hesitation and much less patience I will try some of Abrahams others, they can't be worse than Crying Wolf."
3,"Jump Rope Too short- 5'7 Female, Long Legs?","I normally don't write reviews, but after reading some of the reviews before purchasing I thought I should share my experience.The jump rope gets the job done.However after reading one of the reviews coming from someone 5'10 I didn't think I would have a problem with the jump rope being too short. Wrong! I don't know if its because I have really long legs or what but the rope keeps getting caught on my feet. In order to jump successfully, I have to really bend my knees.I don't mind having to bend my knees because then it pushes me more, however, for those with knee problems this could be an issue.Other than that like I said, the jump rope gets the job done and the handles haven't broken yet."
3,Average but functional,"I have to agree with mschoettle's review, I had much the same experience. The bearing and leather worked fine on my rope. It's not built to last, which is probably reflected in the low price. The leather on mine began to wear through where it contacts at the handles during jumping. After a year and a half of use, it's worn through 60% of the rope. My other problem was that the handle portion closest to the rope is very thin. Upon dropping it one of the few times I was on a hard floor and not a mat, I had a V-shaped notch crack out of the wooden handle. The notch interferes with the movement of the rope while jumping, if it's not positioned to avoid it.Overall it's functional for the price with limited durability, which seems to be the direction Everlast has taken with all of their current products."
2,Jump Slowly!,"I can't believe anyone actually liked this jump rope. I bought one because I find natural materials like wood and leather appealing; and I dislike the plastic ropes that stay bent FOREVER! Which I must mention in this rope's favor -- the leather was nice and flexible from the git go -- HOWEVER, the rope fails to rotate precisely in the handles -- so what winds up happening is this: you get into a nice jumping rhythm and the leather hangs up inside the handle, and you catch your feet on the thing! If you want to do any speed work at all, the light plastic ropes with NO bearings in the handles will outperform this one!"
3,ok,"The jump rope is OK, but this leather rope is thinner (cheaper) than it used to be. I've been jumping for 20 years."
1,Broken,"Used the jump rope maybe 3-4 times and the handle broke off, you would expect a quality jump rope for the price but don't count on it. Then again it could have just been mine."
1,misleading,The decanter has a plastic stopper and the inside top of the decanter is lined in plastic. No where did it mention this ...and now I am stuck with a product I will not use = too much of a hassle to send it back.
1,cheap,i orderd this and it came last friday the 18th of dec. and i sent it back the same day i got it.it looks cheap in person .like they took a bottle and a small perfums bottle and made a decanter ..i had to go to tuseday morning and get me a real decanter .24%lead crystal.and it was the same price as amazon
1,"Cheap, murky glass","It just has absolutely no sparkle to it. The material looks like a 50-cent drinking glass and the rubber stopper is absolutely hideous. The top makes the whole thing look even cheaper. And I know that it IS really cheap, I think we paid about $15, but I would be embarrassed to bring this out in front of guests. YIKES. Just pass on this one."
5,"Excellent, and beats a snow shovel by far!","This item actually does a great job and with a lot less back breaking work when compared to snow shovels. Too costly though, but still beats the cost of going to the doctor for back sprain!"
5,greatful,"EVEN I, CAN HANDLE THIS PRODUCT - WITH MY HUSBAND'S ASSISTANCE WE HAD OUR CIRCULAR DRIVEWAY CLEAR OF MUCHO, MUCHO SNOW AT LEAST 2 FEET W/IN 45 MIN."
5,FABULOSA....,"Love, love, love it! A co-worker had one and gave a demonstration out in the parking lot. Unbelievably easy to use, moves a #### load of snow without breaking your back & arms (I am a 50+ woman). I can clear the driveway easier & faster with this than maneuvering my tractor around. Loved it so much I bought 2 for for friends for Christmas. They were like ""uh gee? thanks for the snow shovel?"", BUT, once they used them they were like ""wow!, this is the best gift ever!"" I paid around $65 each (including tax) special order from the local hardware store. Helpful hint is to spray the shovel with ""Pam"" or WD 40 prior to using!"
5,Awesome snow scooper!,This is great! I didn't have to lift ANY snow with it! Just lift slightly on the handle and push to cut down into the snow and mostly just keep pushing forward with a slight downward force! When it's full - just push down and glide on top of the snow to the dump spot and lift the handle beyond straight up to pack it and pull back! Sooo easy and no more aching back! YOU WON'T REGRET IT UNLESS YOU DON'T GET ANY SNOW!!!
4,takes some practice,"4 stars just because... Hi - I have no need for such shovel living now in South TX - but we used to live in Upper Michigan, where these shovels were affectionately known as ""Yooper Scoopers"". This is a little bit more updated style than what we used, but still basically the same. I will say that at first, using one was somewhat cumbersome, but as the winter progressed and the snow continued to fall, we got better at using it. By the time our first winter was over, we wouldn't of even considered going back to the shovel for the majority of the work. I just want to encourage those of you who didn't like it, to give it some more tries -you'll learn to love it and it'll cut your time down considerably."
2,Hard to use,This shovel is very hard to push and shovel the snow. I purchased theis item because of the reviews. My daughter who is in excellent shape and has extreme upper body strength she wasn't able to push the shovel either. So now it just sits in the garage. :( We can't use it...
1,Disappointing sound quality,"This sounds like it was taped with one microphone at a long distance from the stage. Granted, it's a historic performance, but you can barely distinguish individual voices or instruments. They all blur together into a vague, distant murmur."
5,Ease of Use and Great Pictures.,"I've owned this camera for a couple of weeks now and I must say I am quite pleased with my purchase. You really can't beat the features/price of this camera. I'm a complete novice and I'm finding this camera very easy to learn to use and take clean pictures.When I first was trying to decide which model to buy, I was a bit apprehensive concerning Sony's use of proprietary Memory Sticks. Well, I'm happy to say that not only has Lexar began selling their own branded type of Memory Sticks but, SanDisk has just signed a deal to resell Memory Sticks also. That should not only drive the costs down but, it will make it simpler to find them in stock.I should also mention that the battery life is pretty good on this model and I find the fact that the battery tells you how much life it has left before needing a recharge quite usefull. All in all, I love this camera and am very happy to have jumped into Digital Photography with this model."
5,best digicamera around,"this camera does it all...video with sound, pics in different resolutions, sfx-b/w. sepia, negative....get the biggest memstick you can afford. w/ the 128meg you got 22 min of video or 1000 or so pics on the lowest setting. great for railfans."
4,The Sony DSCS85 an older camera with many good qualities,"For those of us who are technically challenged, this camera is a good start. It has many features. The instruction book is easy to follow. The picture quality is excellent."
5,Excellent Digital Camera!!!,"After a lot of research, I bought the DSC-S85 Digital Camera. I am a Police Officer and I needed a digital camera for crime scenes, auto accidents and, of course, family photos. The Sony DSC-S85 does it all. The DSC-S85 does require you to have some basic understanding of photography and computers but it is also user friendly to someone who wants to learn, and learning with this camera is fun. You won't go wrong buying this camera."
3,"Sharp, but slow","Camera is good overall, but very slow. I am a semi-professional Photographer and I primarily use this camera for family candids and 2 out of 5 images is blurry and/or a picture of a child's head, etc. The camera lens is very sharp (has a Zeiss lens) when it wants to be, but the camera is slow. The delay definitely gets in the way and I find that half of my pictures are of the children's head due to them moving, etc. I do not recommend this camera for family candids or portraits. At the same time, this camera is great when objects don't move and takes amazing close-ups of still-lifes and nature shots."
1,Beautiful camera. Won't accept my 1GB card.,"I bought this camera for the many features, and the nice lens it has. Unfortunately, it won't take my brand new 1gb card from sony. I also tried my 1gb psp card and it won't work.The famous c:13:01 error comes up.there's a 128 mb (old out of production)card that might work, but the cheapest is about $40, and is not even new.You can't buy a new one either, since they're not made anymore, like I said."
3,Sony dsc-s85 Best in 2003 class,"Even though it is now 2011, the Sony DSC -S85 is a unique digital point and shoot camera that allowed for manual settings and f stops as low as 2.1. I used this basic camera to take extremely good low light action sports (volley ball photos). The big glass on this camera makes it stand out from all the hundreds of similar vintage digital cameras that are essentially worthless because of comparable low megapixels but puny glass. this camera is a steal in 2011 just for the creative opportunities from the maual settings and zeiss lens."
1,"When it was good, it was very very good, when it was bad......","The electronics failed in the first four I had, so I said forget it, and bought another brand. Customer servive from kitchenaide was great, but the product only lasted a couple of months. I received four replacements over 18 months, and they all did the same."
4,Great coffee maker for office,"This coffee maker is so good we bought two for the office: black for regular and red for decaf. Multiple users have had no problem figuring out the straightforward process of brewing great pots of coffee. Easy to clean inside and out, too."
4,Henri Cartier-Bresson in India,What a great book. Mr. Bresson is one of the great photographers of our time. The Images are emotional and brilliant.I wish it was available in hard cover.
3,henri in india,the cover photo is a classic and the ghandi images just before his assasination are truly an historical treasure but the rest of the book should have been edited better by the publisher
4,Japanese Fairy Tales,"This book is very interesting and detailed. Many of the things in this book are unexpected! I recommend this book. Some of the tales are sorta boring, but I only had to skip a few parts."
1,Garnishing tool!,"Do not buy, inferior product. Insturments dull and handles are cheaply made!Wish I could give it no starts!"
4,80 pc fruit and vegtable carving set,"A cool set but it is not the most durable set I have seen, but still good value if you geet the right price"
2,Poor quality handles,"I like the variety of this set but the knives aren't particularly sharp and the handles are all coming off way too soon. Even the fabric on the box itself is coming unglued from the back. When I open the set peices are coming out. since they are ""somewhat"" sharp this is no small thing. They really need to step up the quality before I would recommend this."
1,way too cheap,"This is probably the cheapest stuff you could ever get! My 8' Chef knife cost more than the whole set! when it comes to knifes, you can't skimp. Thats one thing you learn in the kitchen, you buy knifes that will last you life time. if you are really serious about cooking or having nice knifes, I would look at Global knifes, they are really great knifes. I use mine all the time!"
1,Horrible,Very cheap product. Some came broken. Alot of useless items. Looks cool on picture because theres alot of item but most of them are duplicated. the wood is very light and cheap. They might be good for carving soft butter but for vegetables they bend and wood breaks
2,Ultimately forgettable,"Three Elvis impersonators, depicting the three stages of his celebrity, put on a show in the Philippines that starts something of a religious movement among the locals. I didn't care for the multiple narrators all using the first person, and I thought the characterization of the Elvises and the Filipino hookers who worked at the same nightclub as them got to be a bit heavy-handed. Ultimately forgettable."
4,"Interesting, intriguing, enthralling, exciting.","As an Elvis fan, I was at first intrigued by the concept of the book, what I got was much more than I had first thought. Deep, well-written, insightful and quite a crop of interesting characters. The trio of Elvis impersonators each have their own well-defined personality, yet also coincide with the many personalities of Elvis - shy boy, wicked ladies man, humanitarian. The story moves through the socio-political-economic climate of a Philippines under the thumb of America and it's Navy. Not for all Elvis fans, but a must for anyone interested in character studies surrounded by a good story and an interesting setting"
2,only good if you like lumps of seasoning and bland hot water together,"First off, this soup does have a great taste. The only big problem (and the reason I stopped buying this product) is that the seasoning does NOT BREAK DOWN into the water no matter how much you mash it with the spoon (and all the Knorr soups I've tried have this problem). All it does is make lots of clumps of seasoning in your pot of water. I really like the taste of this soup, but it's pretty frustrating when the seasoning just clumps up and you end up eating a mixture of bland water and very sour-tasting lumps of bouillion. If only the Knorr people would figure out how to make the seasoning mix with the soup water properly, I might be willing to try this soup again."
5,Excellent insight on revival,"Outstanding insight on the history and future of revival. Well documented research written in an exciting manner. It is one of those ""I can't put it down"" books. One of the best books on revival."
5,Revival Fire,"I would recommend this book to everyone. It is so good to learn of past revivals in our world. It makes you hopeful that revival will come again to America. It is happening in other countries, and God is no respecter of persons. I pray that we will see revival come soon and spread all across the United States of American as well as all the world."
2,Very limited in scope,"While there are quite a few instances of revival recounted in this book, it appears to include only certain ""approved"" accounts of revival which have been sanitized for your protection. George Whitefield and Charles Finney are there, of course, along with many others throughout the world up to recent times. Interestingly enough, there is no mention of the Azusa street revival, or any of leaders of the healing revival in the 1940's. Even the account of the revival in Andrew Murray's church neglects to mention that the outburst of prayer happened to be praying in tongues... it would certainly seem as though this book's author does not approve of THAT kind of revival. There are some good revival stories in this book, but the limited definition of revival makes it very redundant and after a while, the stories becoming boring in their similarity."
5,A sharp warning cry of alarm,"Biopiracy by physicist, ecologist, and environmental activist Vandana Shiva is a harsh but perceptive survey and analysis of the expansion of population pressures on the environment, and more importantly, the technological advances which have been made and which seemingly have begun to dominate and shape life itself, as well as the process by which life is generated. A timely and critically important contribution to environmental policy discussions, Biopiracy is recommended as a sharp warning cry of alarm at where humanity's current tendency to pollute and put the dollar first can lead, as well as the damage that modern trends have down to traditional ways of life, -- especially among native peoples."
2,A powerful theme that is let down by sensationalist writing,"Amidst all the tirade and rhetoric, cold hard truths emerge: the way IPRs are framed, especially those pertaining to the biotechnology field, is biased towards the interests of multinational corporate entities, and that the current mechanistic gene-centric paradigm in the ""life"" sciences ignores holistic perspectives of lifeforms and nature which are useful in their own way. While the urgency and potency of the message is not in doubt, the presentation of the content, with all the sidetracks and rambling discourses, leaves much to be desired. Read this book with an open mind, don't take everything in it too seriously, and look up alternative sources of information as well."
1,For the weak willed and easily fooled,"If your IQ is less than your age, you might actually like this book. I was forced to read this as an assignment for a college course, and I lost all respect for anyone stupid enough to be swayed by such a weak argument. Shiva uses only fear and hyperbole to convince the reader that corporate America is out to destroy everything, much like all the other pieces we read in that course. I beg of you, don't submit yourself to this ... (can I say that?), for if you are really stupid, you might be persueded by it. This is the stuff that people who support acts like the Word Trade Center attack read for inspiration. Just ask my professor."
1,"Poorly written, poorly edited, and contains erroneous material","I am a graduate student; I have been in college for 6.5 years. This is the worst textbook that I have used in my college career. Reading the content of the five star reviews, it is clear to me that few if any of them have actually used this book. As previous reviewers have stated, if you are a professor, please do not have your students use this book."
2,Weak and Inconsistent,"I have to disagree with all of the 5 star ratings of this book. I'm very happy people were able to find it useful, but I found this textbook to be confusing, frustrating, illogical, and weak on content. The examples are poor. The text often doesn't explain itself clearly. The problems are often extremely tedious, repetitive, and inconsistent to the chapter they are relating to. The writing quality is poor, and more than once I discovered formulas that were frustratingly inaccurate (symbols misused, numbers incorrect). Please do not write me off as a complainer, I got a good grade in the class and learned a lot about soils. I just expected a lot better quality and more detailed materials for the price of this rather thin textbook. In my opinion, Check back after a few editions."
3,I dunno now,"I used it in school and did well in school. But now when I look at it for exam review or regular use, I don't care for it. It's a bit convoluted to me."
3,Doesn't cover bound methods,"I think that this book will do it's job if you are new to geotechnical engineering and you'll need to learn the fundamentals of soil mechanics.I've used it for my first undergraduate course in soil mechanics and it was very illuminating.The only drawback is that it does not cover all bound methods,in fact it covers only the limit equilibrium method and thus has not helped me at all in my 2nd course in soil mechanics.I find John Atkinson's ""The Mechanics of Soils and Foundations"" more complete, not to mention it has half the price."
5,UNBELIEVEABLE,"This book has it all. It tells you the basics of geotech such as soil classification, determining the lateral and vertical stresses. It also touches on foundation design as well."
2,It drags on,"My 4-year-old daughter likes this book somewhat, but it has 60-some pages, and drags on and on, with nothing fun happening. The illustrations are dated, and the story has no fun to it. I love reading Mo Willems or Keiko Kasza much more."
5,Can't go wrong with Syd Hoff,My three year old can't get enough of any of the Syd Hoff books. The illustrations and dialog are ideal for 2 to 4 years. Sammy the Seal is his second favorite to Walpole the Walrus (hard to find).
4,Had it as a child; my 2 1/2 year old enjoys it now!,"I had Sammy the Seal when I was a child. I still have my copy, and I read it to my 2 1/2 year old son. He really enjoys it! He also enjoys Danny and the Dinosaur by Syd Hoff. I still have my copy of that too!!"
5,I loved this book!,I couldn't believe I still had the original Sammy The Seal book I had when I was a child! (This just proves how much I cherished it!) I am so delighted that I can pass it on to my 6 year old son as he learns to read. I highly recommend this book and others by Syd Hoff.
1,It Holds One Cup But Makes Six? I Don't Think So!,"I needed a stovetop coffeemaker for some Christmas guests. I just got this and the box clearly says 6-Cups although pot only holds 8 ounces of water. So, either the Italians think a cup is 1.33 ounces OR they expect that you are going to sit at the stove and brew each cup for your six guests one at a time. I don't know anything about coffee but I think a better description of this would be ""1-cup coffeemaker good for up to six brews from the same coffee beans."" If I am missing something here - I hope someone else will correct me!"
4,Very true to life.,"I liked this book a lot! It gave a very realistic portrayal of the world shaman, and you could tell it was completely authentic. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in shamanism, or to professors teaching courses on shamanism."
2,Basic showmanship guidelines,"This video provides basic information such as grooming, apparel, etc. Good video for someone just beginning. Does not go into any training techniques."
1,Not so historical,"I could not get very far into this book because I could not get past all the inaccuracies. I was drawn to the series because my ancestry can be traced back to the Keiths. George Keith (William's brother) would have been my nineth generational grandfather. To begin with, at the time of the civil war, William was married to Elizabeth Seton, he did not marry Anne until 1654. The most glaring inaccuracy was the appearance of William's son Robert, the fact is William Keith had NO male heirs. In 1638 Elizabeth did give birth to a boy (also named William) but he died as an infant. I do realize that this is a piece of fiction, but for the most part, the most base facts should be accurate. I was disappointed that greater care did not go into research, the immediate errors made me unwilling to continue to see if the story was good or not."
1,"Bad book, bad writing","How this got published, I'll never know, but not only was this a bad book, it has to rate so far, as the worst book I've ever tried to read. Made it about 50 pages, then deleted it from my kindle. Do not buy this book unless you are a fan of VERY BAD writing."
1,Disappointing,"Flash 4 is a brilliant and powerful product. Unfortunately the on-line help and documentation that comes with the product lets it down terribly. That's why books on Flash4 are so invaluable. I bought this one particularly for the help on Interactivity, as the book had a fairly large section allocated, and interactivity is the power of Flash4. But so disappointing- this section is so badly explained. No help at all- I am none the wiser on the subject of interactivity- in fact I'm even more confused than I was! I consider this a total waste of 30."
1,Virus on Disc,"My books cd was infected with PWSTEAL.TROJAN (in the flash4full .exe file)although this is not a true virus, if you instal it, it will email the writer your email address."
5,Easiest Book I have ever read,"WOW! The way everything is laid out, the way they explain everything is just so easy to understand and appreciate, these guys are good!"
4,Pretty good book,"This book covers a lot of the key features that are important for those just learning Flash. There are numerous typos throughout the book that make you wonder why the editor is still working. Although the included tutorials on the CD were fun to look at, everything is already done for you so there isn't any interaction.The only reason I am giving this book 4 instead of three stars is due to the amount of information they provide on scripting commands in Flash--which are very important."
1,LOL WHAT A FRIGGEN JOKE!,"LOL THIS AS TO BE A COMEDY BOOK, DEFINITELY NOT SERIOUS. I SURELY HAD MY LAUGHS! THERE ARE SO MANY TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS. FRANKLY SPEAKING, I DONT EVEN THINK THIS GUY KNOWS WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT! HE CANT EVEN TYPE RIGHT! LOL! I DONT RECOMEND THIS BOOK 40 BUCKS DOWN THE DRAIN. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,A particularly weak book,"While this version of Flash # Creative Web Animation is definately an improvement over the last version, it's still extremely weak compared to several of the new Flash 4 titles. If you're a beginner who's lost the manual, this'll be helpful. Otherwise, look elsewhere for real information on Flash. For example, the coverage of ActionScript is brutally perfunctory. There's precious little here I didn't already know. Flash, the technology, is improving, so why shouldn't the books improve along with it?"
3,Not for a beginner....,"I purchased Flash 4! thinking it would teach me some things I didn't know. I was wrong. Not only did it cover too much basic things, it taught it in a not-so-friendly manner. The parts in the book that I really wanted to know was so difficult to understand that I eventually gave up trying. I should have read these reviews before making my book buying decision."
2,Good for starting a fire,"The authors express when creating a Flash program, organization is the key. This book is far from organized. They spend too much time talking about things instead of doing them. Self-help books should have tons of visuals and tutorials, this lacks in both areas. The authors should have sought self-help in organizational skills before selling this book to the masses. One more thing, and this is to all authors of self-help books in any area and that is put your books in a spiral notebook form, its a real pain trying to keep the book open and do the tutorials at the same time. I won't torch it as of yet, but Chicago winters can be brutal."
1,Don't bother!,"This kind of book might be useful if you're already up and running with Flash, but Hillman Curtis's Flash Web Design is MUCH more useful & inspiring. If you're looking to get started try something like Visual Quickstart Guide, and forget this one - are these guys really publishers, or is it just a hobby?"
2,"either Beginner or Advanced, pick another book","It even teaches you how to resize(maximize/minimize) the windows in Flash 4.0! Not very useful when you want to get into the details. Plus, there are numerous typos throughout the book. The only thing worth buying is the CD included, which offer some useful examples."
2,Watching the paint dry,Very dry reading. This is the 2nd time trying to go through this book and I remember why I didn't get through it the 1st time. It makes you get fustrated at the program. Very bad teaching style.
1,Do not buy this book...,This book is nothing but a hoax...Instead just read the online manual...Your knowledge level of Flash will be the same even after you read this book...Wish to get my money back...
1,don't buy,"I just wanted to learn how to create animations with Flash. Well, it took 225 useless pages to get to this point. And the explanation is barely usefull. What a waste of time!"
3,Just FlashHelp in free retelling.,My and author's concepts of `advanced level` very much differ. Any limitations is not circumscribed. Using animated mask level have MANY limitations. Using action-script has HUGE quantity of limitations and usages. In the book I have not found any of. MMFlash have en error in publish-with-JavaScript-template. Because of this error the FSCommands do not work in NN. Where it in the book? 2-frame-based circles allow to create HUGE quantity of unique effects. Where it in the book? Where trigonometry? Where the calculated by action-script animation? I am completely dissatisfied. I shall iterate - just FlashHelp in free retelling and no more. Regards.
1,Waste of Cash,"This book is for the total beginner and if you have mastered the inexpensive Flash 4 ""Quickstart"" book you have no need to buy this overpriced dust collector. Try the Bible for a terrific overview of Flash concepts and Magic for scripting(because there aren't many directions in that one). Buyer's regret never really goes away if you can't have your cash back and these books are expensive."
5,Outstanding!,"As a ""newbie"" to Macromedia's Flash, I found this book extremely helpful. Not only is this book easy and fun to read, but it also gets you well on your way to creating breath-taking Flash movies. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn how to use Flash."
3,"Not that excellent, a ok book though.","I have some background in Flash 3 and have read the original Flash 4 manual. Therefore I don't found the book helps me a lot. Some examples are very good but some cannot get to the point directly. Even though this book comes with a CD, I still like the original manual since its way of teaching is simple, cover all the basics of Flash 4 and can directly get to the point. However if you don't have the manual or the basic knowledge of Flash, you will need this book."
3,A good start for newbies.,"The coverage is a bit better than the product manual which makes this book a good start for new Flash users. It is, however, not for those who already have some Flash experience (from previous Flash ver.). If you have already done studying basic Flash techniques, look for more advanced Flash book(s)."
2,Just read the manual,"Just read the manual, and spend your money on the Flash Bible.The chapter on interactivity (11) was the only one I found to have ANY meat or value. You'll find better techniques and tutorials on the web, though.If you're looking for an intro for the EXTREME beginner, or a slow, exhaustive list of features and step-by-step instructions. . .this is it. If you're looking for creative inspiration, slick techniques or eye-catching effects, look elsewhere."
1,Not worth the money!,"Bought the book looking for something more than a step by step description of each feature of Flash, this is all included in the manual that comes with the Flash program. I was also highly disappointed in the book as I don't think it was proofed or spell checked (many typos). This book is tooooo basic even for the beginner, we need examples (that work) most of the example files included on cd rom did not work on my NT system and was very frustrating as I couldn't see what the author was talking about.Definitely a waste of money if you're looking to learn how to create in Flash."
3,better than nothing,"I thought this book kinda sucked...many of the tutorials just decribe what they have done instead of you seeing it being done...maybe it is the nature of being a beginner, but the book never tells you how to put all the different techniques together...there is not a great explanation of how to make graphics that actually look really good...I think there needs to be a way of guiding you through a complete project that incorporates many different elements so you see something go from start to finish...and then focus on the specifics...someone said that this book did not have them banging their head again the wall...well it has made me very frustrated....in the end it is the only flash book I currently have...it's not all bad...anybody know of a better one?"
1,very low budget,"this is a very low budget movie i couldnt even sit through it and I love boxing movies,beware this is not a boxing movie."
3,One of the most extraordinary books I have ever read!,"This is not an easy book to read.Which is exactly why I love it so much.It tantalises the reader to question what is being said, and very few books in the same genre out there manage to do that. The first time I read this book, I couldn't put it down.I found it exciting and alot of what De Mello said, refreshing. I decided to re-read the book again after having it for a year or two and I found it just as exciting, but by the time I had finished the book was thoroughly tired of the De Mello condescending and patronising tone, which at times was unnecessarily over the top.Nevertheless it doesn't spoil the content of the book, which is brilliant.If you crave a book that will put you on the path to questioning your own reality and sense of being, then this book is a great starting point."
4,Awareness,"An intense book to help you learn more about yourself.Different then most books of this kind. It is not an easy read.Had to digest, re-read many parts. Its one to keep you thinking!"
3,Awareness,"Awareness by Anthony De Mello is useful, parts do not conform with Church teachings. Good to read, but read carefully!"
5,The flawless vocals sans instruments are extraordinary!,"AVB has quietly achieved what few people do in the music business -- flawless vocals. Their mixture of harmonies and rhythyms on every song from their latest release, REAL, is a standard for any musical interest. Their knack, though, is sans instruments. Their talent levels pour through the speakers as you awe at their ability to produce and imitate sounds that you only know from instrumental productions. The vocal percussion that rattles the speakers, along with the bass that is also produced only with a human voice, is enough to make you want to sing along. The tunes are catchy and the words are real. They have found their knack in the contemporary Christian arena. Expect big things from this group. This CD will not be a disappointment."
5,Good Buy,"I ordered 2 cartridges. The price is right and the first cartridge has been working fine for over 3 weeks, works better than the cartridge I replaced. I got my order within 3 days, free shipping -- I'm happy! Most definitely will order from here again."
4,Not Entirely Happy,"Re: Premium Compatible Black Ink Cartridge for HP45 printerOrdered 3 with use over 2 months.1st cartridge performed well on a HP Deskjet 6122 (with duplex printing).2nd cartridge would not work on ""draft"" setting, and second side of duplexer: Had to resort to flipping copies over for second side printing, and use ""normal+"" settings for any degree of quality.3rd cartridge is a disaster: Will print several copies okay, and then goes crappy. Tried maintenance settings and recalibration to NO avail. It is the cartridge.Suspect the refiller does NOT do a good job of testing the cartridges before a complete refill, and shelf life may also be questionable. NOT HAPPY WITH THIS SUPPLIER, AT THIS TIME!!!!"
2,Ink Quality too low to be considered Premium,"After receiving the product, I discovered that there were lines in the lettering and general bluriness in the print-out. My printer is working fine as my previous ink cartridge was printing sharp black lettering just ten minutes ago."
2,Not as good as the original.,"This ink is nowhere near as good as the original. High quality mode is comparable to draft mode from the original ink. The letters aren't as crisp as they should be and looks faded in parts. It also has lots of trouble with thin straight lines which come out squiggly if they are even printed at all. Also takes time to ""warm up"" which means the first 2 pages look absolutely horrendous and the ones after are just simply bad so you'll probably end up throwing some prints away.2 stars because the prints are perfectly legible for my own personal notes, but I can't use this ink for something like a paper that I have to turn in."
1,Absolute crap,"2 cartridges color #78: one prints only in black, the other one in black and yellow!. Even the cartridge that was supposed to have been replaced has more color left in it.Rating actually is 0 stars"
1,Stopped working after <20 pages,"Bought this ink cartridge 12/4/10. Installed it and used it for printing 1-2 pages per week. Now two and a half months later, after printing less than 20 pages, it stopped working. No ink showing on printed pages. Opened up printer, removed & reinstalled cartridge, but still no ink on printed pages..."
5,Handy Manual,Covers the service requirements of the Harley Davidson FXD models very well. I had problems tracking down a printed version of the factory service manual. This manual served me very well.
4,Mary's Rescue review,Mary's Rescue was a really good book. The author made alot of the sense very suspenseful. She made it were you will be shocked of what happened. When Racheal was getting beatin up you wouldn't think that would happen to her. The author made it were you keep reading. There also was alot of irony in the book.
2,ME KOOL,I think this book will be verey good to read because it tell you what its like to live by your self
1,People _read_ this stuff?,"Books about a bad tv show, sort of like ""fan fiction"" that people actually buy and read. How can I get on this gravy train?"
3,"Good book, but...","Dave knows a lot about lacrosse, but until he writes a chapter on how to create systems that get the most from the types of players you have, this book will be lacking. Lacrosse is one of the most dynamic games that there is, and any book like this should spend a good deal of time addressing the dynamics of how different schemes pair up with others."
5,Highly recommended Flat screen mount,"All the other reviews from Amazon convinced me to purchase this unit. The silver unit was significantly cheaper than the black. It does not show in my situation so I saved the $$. Excellent mount, easy to install, and performs as advertised. The directions were not the best, but the set up and mounting is fairly straight forward. I have a 52"" Sony mounted on this unit and it is very solid. Movement is easy and steady out to full extension. EXCELLENT PRODUCT."
5,Outstanding,Excellent product with clear yes clear instructions and ever imaginable combination of bolt etc you could need. Normally I am skeptical of products like this but this does a great job and is worth the price.
5,"Very well made, Easy to Install",This is a very well made mount.I could not believe how easy it was to install. Be sure to download the instructions from the sellers web site. The printed manual is missing the page that suggests you to remove the arms to make mounting easier.I also purchased the speaker mounts that were made for the XP.
5,"OmniMount UCL-XP Dual Arm Cantilever Mount (fits 42""-63"" flat panels)","This product was exactly as described. We have a 52"" Samsung (I think it weighs about 68lbs?) and this works great. The color is pewter not black. But no matter b/c you cannot see it behind the tv.It is very easy to move the tv up, down, in or out. Very easy to install, it will take at least 2 people, maybe 3 if you cannot lift the tv on your own.I would purchase again.Oh and the price was fantastic. At the popular BB store, a similar product was ~800.I shopped around and found this for a great deal."
5,Great Product,I needed a strong mount to put my new flat screen on the wall over the fireplace. I wanted to be able to adjust the viewing angle and downward tilt. This mount does all of that and does it well.I would have no reservations about recommending this to anyone who has a large flat screen to mount.
5,The best wall mount!,"There were hundreds wall mounts to chose from, so I went to a store to look at them, and found the OmniMount UCL-XP.It costs more than some, but it MORE than worth it!I have a 46"" Samsung LCD TV that, with this mount, I can turn, pull out, or tilt to accommodate any need. I can even pull it out far enough (probably close to 2 feet) and turned so that the TV can be clearly seen from my kitchen table! It's ridiculous how I can manipulate this mount!I figured that I'd want to have a lot of options, if I was going to hang it on the wall.Installation was a breeze! The instructions were VERY easy to follow. Included was a wall template that showed where the electrical box needed to be, and the installation only took me about 1 hour to complete.I am VERY happy with my purchase!"
5,Great Plazma TV wall mount,"I mounted my 50"" plasma TV at the far end of our family room and can pull it out almost 2 feet and angle up to 45 degrees. The lag bolts into wall studs are solid so there is no play in the mount when I position the TV as needed. Unless you simply want to mount a TV flat on the wall, this is simply the best way to go."
3,Minor parts missing,I purchased the OmniMount UCL-XP look alike that was promoted as being better. I put it up yesterday although I bought the bracket three weeks ago. I had a minor problem with screwing in one of the bolts that attaches the plate on the tv to the plate on the wall bracket; it seems like the threads were not complete drill through. Another problem was the two of the ends pieces on the bars attach to the tv were missing. It looks fine but the quality assurance needs to be improved. I am hoping someone at Amazon can help with my problem.
3,"Beware! Requires 16"" stud spacing; not compatible with 24"" spacing.","This product requires your wall studs to be spaced 16"" apart. I found it incredible that you have to actually find this in the manual. 24"" stud spacing is fairly common I think, and a wall mount should be compatible with both. Or at least put that into the product description!!The return shipping for this 48-pound item is NOT cheap."
4,Heavy Duty and Very Well Built,"This mount is very substantial in construction. It holds my heavy 58"" Panasonic plasma TV with ease. My only complaint is with the instructions. When I originally measured for drilling the mounting holes I ""assumed"" the TV would be centered over the center of the plate screwed to the wall. Wrong! I found out later the TV was then several inches too low. I should have placed the hanger brackets onto the TV first. Then it would have been apparent that a higher wall plate location was required for the TV to be properly located. After relocating the wall plate, it was perfect. It seems that not all TV's position the mounting brackets the same way. The effect that has over the relative centering should have been highlighted in the instructions IMHO."
5,This is a great flat panel wall mount,"This is a high end, full featured, beautifully designed mount.It is easy to install and looks great."
5,More of a man than just an evolutionist.,"This is a marvelous story about a complicated man who faced great trials in life yet accomplished great things. Instead of the tired evolutionists arguments, this book tells of the childhood, the courtship, the struggles with physical health and the great family accomplishments of Charles Darwin, without skipping the intellectual genius of his mind and his scientific achievements. Enthralling."
5,L glass is awesome,"I bought this lens in March of this year from Amazon and took it on a cruise to the Mexican Riviera, I took about 40 shots in low light of a play on the ship using only stage light and WOW!! I can not believe the color, clarity, and sharpness of the images I took from about 25 rows away from the stage using I.S. alone without a flash or a tripod, I am truly glad I bought this lens."
5,Image Stabilizer definitely worth it,"I originally purchased the non-IS version. It worked fine at day light but under weaker light such as night indoor it couldn't take a good shot compared to the 70-300mm IS USM lens (not an L) which has the similar price. I don't mean the lens were bad - it certainly delivered within its design.So I sold the lens and went for this one. It is amazing. With almost the same size and weight it gives much better shots under weaker light. The only con is the price - more than double the cost of the non-IS version, and no rebate either this year. But if you plan to use this a lot, the IS is definitely worth it."
4,"4.5 stars! If you can have only one zoom lens, this is it...","Pros:1.Great low light pictures (almost no need for a tripod for my purpose; when I need a tripod, I usually know ahead of time; at all other times, it is great to have a walk-about zoom lens like this).2. tack sharp pictures (more than compensates for the lack of a higher zoom range; compares favorably with non-L 70-300 lenses at 300mm compared to a sharper image at 200mm with this lens; in any case, with DSLR, the range is really 112-320mm)3. excellent IS/Autofocus performance4. very light lens compared to typical L zoom lenses (but without any compromise whatsoever - weather sealing etc).5. Reasonably pricedCons:Only one, if at all: IS makes some extra noise (compared to myCanon EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM Lens for Canon EOS SLR CamerasMy 24-105mm is very quiet. Not sure if my copy has a problem or other people have seen this too.."
5,Great lens and great service from Amazon.,"I bought this lens for my Canon 30D. It is incredibly sharp. It is everything that the reviews say it is. A truly great lens.The seller, Amazon, is great too. After having a problem with the order, Amazon corrected it promptly. I wouldn't order my lenses from any other seller. With the Amazon card, I get free shipping too. I've bought several lenses from Amazon and am very pleased with price, shipping and service.My only gripe is that Canon doesn't send the tripod mount ring with the lens and charges an outrageous price to purchase it separately. For using with a monopod, the ring is nice to have. The f/2.8 version of the lens comes with the ring. Come on Canon! For the price, the lens should come with the ring."
5,simply awesome!,It is the best lens I ever had. The image stabilizer is really good and obtains a great definition. 100% recommendable for anyone. It is better to pay a little bit more by an original product.
5,MUST GET LENS,"The reviews of this lens are superb, so I won't re-hash. The lens itself is Canons BEST lens ever made, based on cost vs. performance. If you are serious about photography, and if your budget permits, this is a MUST have lens. It is as sharp at 200mm, as my [...] 200mm f2.0 IS... yes, the f2.0 is 2 stops faster, but requires a tripod as its so damn heavy and long. Considering its zoom range, relatively light weight and compact size (considering its fl and zoom range), this lens is truly a breakthrough in lens technology. At $[...] it is clearly a bargain in the photo world.... Here is a shot, handheld, 200mm that shows just how sharp this lens is... notice the gorgeous Bokeh (out of focus area) shot on 50dGo to Tinyurl dot com/cyw3xl"
4,Nice F4 to carry around,"This is a nice lens that I regulaly use for wedding photography. F4 will work in most situations, but not all situations. The image stabilization will provide several stops of benefits. It is a good lens for backpacking and such as well."
5,It's a keeper,"this lens will not disappoint. And for those thinking about the 70-200 F2.8, I had one and it is just too heavy to use hand held. But the70-200mm f4 IS USM is perfect to carry around or to hike with with a back pack. Good weight considering how robust its construction is and great, absolutely great, pictures."
5,This is a must have lens,"This lens provides even higher quality images then the non-IS version. Additionally, the IS is fantastic.! I have taken many crystal sharp pictures at speeds as slow as 1/10 of a second."
4,Beautiful Lens,I use this with a 5D and the combination creates some lovely photos. I had to try two copies of the lens because of corner softness. Its capable of producing gorgeous shots. Works well with the 1.4x adapter.
3,Surprising results with this lens,"I purchased this lens after reading many great reviews online. However, I have to say that after testing it during a photo shoot using this lens, a Canon 55-250 & Sigma 17-70 I truly didn't see a significant difference in image quality. As this lens is more expensive than most I decided to return it and use my more inexpensive lenses which I am very pleased with. I love Canon lenses and everyone can't be wrong, so I would suggest trying it for yourself."
2,Would not work with my Canon,This lenses has good reviews but for some reason it would not work with my Canon D7! Canon would not answer my questions!
3,Canon ef 70-200,I am a little disappointed in this lens. I am not impressed with the sharpness and it is very difficult to receive perfect pictures every time.Unless the IS is on my pictures are not sharp. Some pictures are great but I was hoping for more pictures as keepers. With alot of practice I have been able to get better pictures.
5,Awesome!!!!!,"This was a Christmas gift with the Canon t2i!! I can't type quick enough to describe my enthusiasm, but in a nutshell...FRIGGING AWESOME!! Nice crisp pics, nice zoom, and even better with the specs of the Canon t2i, with the 200mm, I can seriously crop an excellent quality pic."
5,"My First ""L"" Series Lens","I purchased a Canon 50D beginning of this year with the kit lens (28-135). My first step up from a 35mm Pentax ME Super and boy am I ever enjoying photography more now! No more worries about enough film. After that purchase I next purchased a 17-55 2.8 lens. Never having a lens that fast before put me at another level. I always spend a lot of time researching before I buy camera equipment, or anything for that matter, and my next wish was a ""L"" lens. Since I started in photography back in 1984 I've found this hobby to be very addicting. This 70-200 4.0 IS zoom is awesome. I've only had it 3 weeks and I've shot over 400 pictures and I love it. When I've used it the way I'm supposed to the pictures are awesome in the camera. Canon prices are very expensive but ....... quality comes with a price. I highly recommend this lens if you can afford it."
2,Not what I expected based on NPR review,"The CD has a significantly heavier, more punkish sound than works for my kids (2.5 & 4 years), and than expected based on the review by National Public Radio. ""The Grizzly Jive"", by Georgie James, and ""Centerfield"", by Visqueen, played on NPR, are upbeat and do get my kids dancing and grinning."
5,GREAT BOOK,"I LOVE THIS BOOK!!! not necessarily for the words--the photographs are so beautiful. the story is better told in the pictures than the words. Marina got her dream come true. She got to ride freely over the hills on her own horse, that she raised from birth. I WANT TO HAVE MARINA'S LIFE!!!"
4,a challenging read,"While ultimately I found the book inspiring, it was difficult to read in a continuous sitting. I found that I had to ""digest"" one chapter at a time. The writer's story made me feel uncomfortable at times. Perhaps because it reminded me of things I had experienced and would rather forget. I do believe her personal discovery has important messages for the reader. And the exercises or meditations at the end of each chapter are very helpful to someone on the road to recovery/discovery. However, this is not a book for someone who is not ready to seriously examine why they have used fatness as a source of protection. It can be quite painful to do the work the author has done. It was well written and well organized."
4,Motivating not instructional...,"I've been a fan of Tony Royster Jr. for a long time. His skill is unreal. When I saw that he had put out another dvd, I knew that I had to add it to my collection. The playing in this dvd was amazing. Guest apperances by Terry Bozzio and Dennis Chambers were a nice touch. There playing was great as always. Tony's playing was amazing. I swear he gets faster everytime I see him play. If your looking for instruction, this is not for you. This dvd shows some great performances from Tony and his band ASAP but there is no teaching of any kind. All in all, I enjoyed this dvd."
3,Pretty Standard,Nightwing: On the Razors Edge was OK. There nothing bad about it just lacking excitement. Chuck Dixon's writing is ok but I feel as if his writing needs more spark.I wasn't really aware of shrike's past (even though he was on the rollcall page) so his appearance didn't really appeal too me. Greg Land's art was fantastic and makes a very awesome well toned Nightwing. His Oracle is fantastic and Babs looks so much better with green eyes. Black Canary & Amy were also done wonderfully with beautiful facial expressions along with the rest of the cast.The other artist with just blech...i thought there styles just weren't right.Anyways the graphic novel was ok...though I was rather read something else in my spare time.Ciao
1,Save Your Money,"If I had never heard Honky Tonk piano before, I might like this album. But, I have, and I certainly don't. I don't like Mr. O'Donnell's phrasing or execution. Too many finger stumbles on the keyboard for my taste. Where's Knuckles O'Toole when you really need him? I'll stick to Jo Ann Castle."
3,beats nothing,"I wouldn't have gotten this, except so little honky-tonk piano is out there. not one album by Del Wood, Knuckles OTool, Fred Burton or Slugger Ryan. This is all, so I bought it. this is what was there, so I got it at a bargain. wish those others were available."
2,I was hoping for something different,"It's clear that this writer has a lot of enthusiasm for her subject material. However, as I read this book what I was really struck by was how much what she discussed focused on theory, with little application of practical techniques that could incorporate her concepts into a person's life.I think she has some brilliant ideas, but I would've liked to have seen those concepts followed through on in a manner that went deeper than just a presentation of theory."
4,Good overview,"Although a little dated now, this is a good, brief, easy-to-read overview of the militia movement in the United States."
4,A great toy!,"This is a nice piece of work. It has great gameplay modes, I especially like the ones where you or a partner add onto the pattern instead of the computer. It is challenging to get large sequences (over 8,) but simple for small ones. It is very fun and cool."
3,Completely satisfied with the vendor.,"For some reason the Simon didn't want to work for me, but Leesresearch was WONDERFUL about giving me a return and full refund even though it worked for him. That says as much about his reliability and honesty as anything could. Thank you for a reassuring and satisfying experience!"
1,"Purchased Simon 2 Game, DIDN'T WORK!!!!!",I purchased the Simon 2 game to give to my younger brother for Christmas. I didn't test the game before I gave it to him with assurance that it would work because it said it was in working condition when I bought it. He opened it on Christmas morning and it did not work!!!! I am very angry and I will never buy from this company again. That is just ridiculous! I do not recommend them.
4,Simon2 review,"I think that product maybe be it better, it's no bad but could be much better. However it's funny."
2,Returned Twice,"We purchased this toy for our 10 year old son and he enjoyed playing with it. However, after just a few hours of play the buttons started sticking or not registering when you pushed them so you couldn't ""win"" or move up.We returned the toy and got a new one and the same thing happened with just a few hours of play. We returned it a second time and got our money back. Not a lot of fun if it doesn't work. I would not recommend."
5,Didn't last two weeks,"This is a very fun toy, but unfortunately, it completely died after only two weeks. It wasn't ill-treated, but one day we tried to start a game and one light just turned on permanently. I took out and replaced the battery, and it hasn't shown any sign of life since."
1,Simon game,"The buttons get stuck after very little use, they are hard to push for little hands, unit gets stuck and will NOT turn off. It just starts making noise while just laying there. There is no way to just turn it off without removing the batteries. Not at all happy with this toy."
5,Wow,This one is a must have! Mitch follows in Rich's footsteps with wonderful melodies and outstanding lyrics. I can't wait for his next release.
5,Greatest Kids Book Ever,"When I was a kid my mother used to read this to me all the time. It has created some of my fondest memories. It is perhaps the greatest children's book ever written. I suggest it to every parent. For those who dislike the Land Before Time series, let me tell you, this is a million times better. Don't tell anyone, but I still read it sometimes. I recommend this book to all. A true never dying classic."
2,Dog Tie Out,I did not pay attention to how big of a dog this would restrain. I have two Labrador retrievers - 60 and 70lb. This product was distroyed the first day.It would be alright for a dog of 8 - 10lb.
3,queen size cotton mattress pad,"Dealing with Amazon is a pleasure, fast delivery, excellent communications.This product, although is the right size, it is not the quality promised.After the first wash, the thread started coming lose and I am afraid what the second wash might do. For the record, I washed it carefully in accordance with washing instructions and I have front loading A1 machines.I do not recommend this product for others."
4,not for memory foam,I bought this product to be a cover for my memory foam mattress but it made the bed too firm because it did not allow my body heat to go through and conform the mattress to my body. This could be a good thing for some people though if their memory foam mattress is too soft for them. The cover does fit well and it is being used on my other non-memory foam bed and is working well for that.
2,Feels cheap - the sides are plastic,"I'm disappointed with this mattress pad. The sides that are supposed to hold it on the mattress are plastic and have torn within a month of normal use. Now one of the corners slips and I have to adjust it all the time. The top layer is extremely thin, but otherwise OK. I would happily spent another $20 to get a worthwhile mattress pad. As it is, I'm sending it back."
1,took a gamble and lost,"I had read a wide range of reviews before I ordered this mattress pad. Boy, when the reviews range so far and wide it's really hard to decide whether to take the chance or not. Well, I did, and lost!! The first time my son put it on his bed it ripped in at least 5 places!! I bought it back in January as a gift for him and he didn't use it until last night, so I have missed the return time frame!! BOOOO....Maybe Amazon will work with me....we'll see....(update 3/29/13)-Amazon has been great in rectifying the situation, thanks so much!! We'll see how the next one does!!"
1,Believe the Poor Reviews,"We saw the mixed reviews and figured the poor reviews (as is often the case) were from people expecting perfection or who didn't know how to use the product. We apologize! We were originally impressed with the deep pockets and the fit. However, the skirt material began to shred almost immediately and after one washing developed 12"" rips every place we pulled on it. Imagine my frustration this morning when I tried to return them (we bought two) and found out I had missed the window by two days! These will end up being very expensive painting drop cloths. Why isn't there a zero star category??"
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this and the first time I went to put it on my bed it ripped on the side wall. My bed is a regular full size bed nothing special about it, and the mattress pad fit just fine so I wasn't trying to stretch it to make it fit or anything. I was sad, but I called amazon and they gave me a full refund and I went to JCPennies and bought a better one for about the same price, but I still was disappointed this one didn't work out. Guess you cant win them all lol"
5,Great cover,"I was just looking for a simple, thin mattress cover. I found it! It doesn't make our bed hotter or anything like that, it's well-made and affordable."
1,dont wadte your $$$ ripped the firsf time we tried to use it!,Horrible. Ripped like paper. The side portion that wraps around the sides.couldn't even get it on our bed. Really disappointed in this purchased.
1,One use and ripped side,"Unfortunately, this product was not what I had hoped. It was a great price, but on the first use the corner that pulls over the mattress ripped in several places and no longer stays on the bed. I would not order this product again and will now have to look for another mattress pad, so it was a waste of money."
1,Rips apart along the seams,"Size fit was good and it looked great, but then with the first time I used it, the stitches that hold the elastic cords to the pad started to rip along the stitches. I would not recommend this product and hope to find a better pad stronger made and better quality. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BI7OR8/ref=oh_o03_s01_i00_details"
2,Junk,I realize this wasn't a very expensive mattress pad BUT I bought it to use in a guest room. I chose this particular one because it had the deep pockets. I washed it as directed ONE time and when I made the bed up the sides began to split where the elastic ribbing is sewn into the fabric. The top portion of the mattress pad seems to be fine but I'm sure I won't be able to wash this again without it now falling apart since it is already torn in two spots and I will need to tug on it to make the bed up again. I wouldn't suggest it. I'll be looking for another one that I can see & feel before I purchase it.
3,Cut on the SMALL side,"I bought this pad because of some unfavorable reviews from others about how thin the pad is . . . which is exactly what I was looking for. We spent a fortune on a high end mattress which offers specific, ""feel"" benefits. The last thing I wanted was a tufted, thick mattress pad to mask the feel of the mattress. To that end this mattress pad is PERFECT and very comfortable. It's cool to the body. But it was a challenge to install as it's not quite queen size. I didn't measure it - should have - but it really was a struggle to get all 4 corners finally and quasi-properly tucked. The feet end of the pad is tucked correctly while the head end of the pad is quite stretched and I was able to barely secure it. Nevertheless, it is very comfortable but my guess is after one washing and unavoidable shrinking I will have to install another pad.Let the shopping begin. Again."
1,cotton top full mattress pad,"I ordered and received a mattress pad manufactured by Louiseville Bedding Co. This product is so inferior that I cannot believe that Amazon.com promotes the sale of it under their super saver shipping program. Considering that I can buy the same product at Walmart for around $18 but paid $30 from Amazon.com, I cannot help but feel that Amazon.com is charging for the shipping and perpetuating fraud. The pad shrank so bad that I am unable to get it onto the bed. Considering that the standard sizing for a full bed is 54X75 and this pad was 53X75 it started out smaller. I do not feel that it is fair to expect me to pay money to ship this back to Amazon.com and therefore I expect Amazon.com to send me a prepaid shipping label. Then when Amazon.com receives the pad I expect to get a full refund on my charge account."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"I used this matress cover for my RV mattress and it has been a good purchase, I even used a 2"" memory foam mattress topper and had plenty of room. It has performed well and was a great fit not too short or long. Price was great too! So you could say I'm a Happy Camper!! :)"
5,great bargain,"This was very cheap, but good quality. The only thing that bothered me at first was it would slide around on top of my mattress. I think after a couple washings, it will soften up though. Very nice quality and plush. I would buy this again. Wish I would have bought 2."
3,Torn corner on the first day.,"I have a really nice mattress so I just wanted a bit of a protective layer between the mattress and my sheets, and wanted to avoid the crunchy, plastic feel of mattress protectors. I don't notice a substantial difference in comfort, but I did notice that when I first put it on my mattress one of the corners tore. Granted, I was perhaps a bit rough with it but have never had that problem before. I was surprised and I don't expect it to hold up too long because of the current tear."
3,it's adequate,"The image (picture) looks pretty good but the actual product isn't as plush as it appears. It's adequate to provide a little extra softness though. The bottom part that wraps around the base of the mattress keeps the pad tight and prevents slipping but the material used is like a paper fabric with elastic thread. I'm not sure how long that will last.Overall, for a child's bed it's fine since it will be sooner than later that the child will out grow the bed."
4,you get what you pay for,"The product arrived quickly and YES IT DID FIT, however it is not very thick so it only ad a marginal amount of confort, which is why the product was bought. However for the price its ok"
4,Queen Mattress Cover,"I am very pleased with the Queen Mattress Cover. I especially like the deep, gathered sides that hold the cover in place. It fits well and doesn't leave wrinkles under the sheet."
1,Bad Quality,"The structure is defective. When I tried to put a pad on the mattress, the fabric on the sides of the pad kept ripping apart forming holes.I had to return this item."
3,average,"This mattress pad is worth no more than the $23 I paid for it. It does not compare to nice, soft, comfy mattress pads anywhere from $40-$60. This mattress pad will not enhance the feel of your mattress. It is strictly to protect your mattress from body oils, etc."
2,Be careful,"I read all the reviews about this product before I bought it and decided to make the purchase because it was a cotton top product.The good side: it has a nice fit and the top does what I want it to (which is to provide a cotton barrier between the top sheet and my tempurpedic mattress).The bad side: the skirt on the sides seems to be made out of some kind of thin material and my finger went right through it went I put it on the bed.I am not going to send it back because I need it immediately, but I would not buy this item again."
1,this item is crap - do not buy,"We had this for less than 2 months and it tore in 3 places. Awful quality. I am trying to return and hope amazon.com will stand behind their product. If so, I will update this review."
1,No ID on packaging!,"This mattress pad arrived in a clear plastic bag that was UNSEALED! Moreover, the bag had absolutely no identification stating it was made by Louisville Bedding. There was no writing of any kind on the plastic bag, and it was not sealed! How do I know that someone else did not already use this mattress pad? Either the company was at fault, or Amazon re-packaged it; either way, I don't want it, I am returning it. Doesn't look like a very good mattress pad anyway."
1,Poor Quality,"Ordered this sent to the dorm for my daughter's college room. Arrived well, but the sides of the cover ripped on the first making of the bed! Cheap in every way."
4,It's OK,I got king size. It shrunk a bit after laundering it and drying in the dryer but still fits.
5,Great material especially for the price.,I bought one just like this from a dept store and paid twice as much.
1,Tore in less than 2 weeks of use,"I bought this for my son and his wife for a Christmas gift. He said that,in less than two weeks of putting it on their bed,the edge fabric tore in two places in big strips, which caused the mattress pad and the sheets to continually come off the bed. He said that the edge fabric that stretches over the sides of the mattress is a paper like fabric and not very durable. I reread the reviews of all the mattress pads that I had looked at, being careful to notice the ones that had actually used them for a period of time. I ordered another one, a little more expensive, and they really like it."
1,Not Impressed!!!!,"I am very unimpressed with this product. The first time I put it on my mattress, the sides ripped in 3 places. The accordian sides are not held together well at all. This was a waste of money."
1,Definitely Cheap,"I purchased this thinking that it was inexpensive and cotton. When I received and opened it, I was surprised that the pad was ""crunchy"" feeling (not like 100% cotton). I thought it might go away with a wash, but it didn't. My new mattress is a pillowtop, so it's quite thick. The pad is slippery and I found it was difficult to get on. When I pulled tight on the baffled sides to get a tight fit, I ripped holes in the pad in more than one place. I guess this falls into the category of ""disposable mattress pad"" since it's unlikely given the flimsiness, that it will last long."
1,Absolute Piece of Garbage,"I got this mattress cover based upon the price and some of the positive reviews. I always look at the one star reviews but take them with a grain of salt, because you are always going to have the occasional faulty product or dissatisfied customer. You can't please everyone all the time. But if the vast majority of the reviews are five and four stars, I will consider buying it based on price and how closely it meets my needs.But this time the people giving one stars were totally correct. I bought it, washed it and put it over the mattress. Time to wash it a second time, and THE SECOND TIME I PUT IT OVER THE MATTRESS IT RIPPED! I threw it away today after it started to rip more in different places (its past the return date). The mattress pad I had before this one lasted me about 8 years. Go ahead and buy it, just be aware that you have been warned."
3,mattress topper,"I received this on time, and it does fit my bed, but there is about a 3"" area in one of the side seems that completely missed the sewing machine.Not happy, but kept it because of the work involved to return. I will sew it myself. Kim"
5,Great Quality,This item was just as described. It is of high quality and fits well over pillow top mattress. It washes up great.
1,It's already falling to bits,Really bad quality and its already falling to bits. It's a very tight fit on my Californian king bed and this makes it really difficult to put on single handedly.
3,Quality okay,"The quality of this product wasn't the best, but considering the price, it was okay. We have a memory foam topper on our bed and the pad doesn't stay on very well over the edges. Actually it didn't fit perfectly (should have been longer, the width was okay). It's thick enough though. I'm not sure how it will wash as I haven't washed it yet. Over-all it's satisfactory for the money I spent."
3,OK for the money,"I have a pillow top mattress and it rides up often. My fix was to use mattress straps. OK, but not great."
4,Insightful!,"Beverly Kaye and Sharon Jordan-Evans have written a useful book for employees who are tempted by greener pastures. The authors caution that those who pursue a glittering opportunity often wind up in a golden mess. Thus, it makes sense to at least try to improve your job before seeking another one that, ultimately, may be even worse. The book's format offers one item of advice for each letter of the alphabet. At times, the formula wears a bit thin (X for ""X-ers and Other Generations""), but the advice itself is sound. It primarily consists of encouraging you to decide what you want and go get it. We recommend this book to currently employed malcontents (you know who you are!) and to those who need help mustering the nerve to discuss job satisfaction with their employers. Perhaps the best piece of advice is to only approach your supervisors for a favor when you understand their WIIFT: ""What's In It For Them."""
5,No Regrets!,"I bought this album about a year ago and I still play it very frequently! The thing is, you just won't get fed up of listening to her records! Her techniques and versatility are stunning! Track no.1 (Love Life) is very Maniac Street Preachers! It's great and is certainly a pleasure to listen to! Song no.2 (Face)is definitely the best! Her voice is brilliant, and the track won the Best Lyrics Award last year! The 3rd track (Sex Commandments), is again, performed with a different style. The song is wicked and somehow beautifully morbid! It was selelcted as one of the best 10 records in Hong Kong last year! Trust me, the first 3 tracks on the album are enough to satisfy...The front cover of the album is stunning, take a look and you will know why! To me, listenning to her songs is a whole new experience, and I am definitely looking forward to enjoy her upcoming works! EXCELLENT!"
2,just ok,"Overall they are nice looking and fitting shoes, however one of the shoelace eyelets at the toe has torn. It hasn't affected the usefulness of the shoe but I shouldn't have to deal with a torn eyelet within the first week."
4,DarkKylie,"Taking a sour, more introspective turn, Kylie's 1997 offering Impossible Princess is a marked departure from her earlier, fluffier fare. And yet, the CD's roots can be found in her previous, self-titled effort. Mixing harder-edged beats with wrenching lyrics, Impossible Princess in many ways is the death of her earlier persona and heralds her rebirth as a bona fide diva in the 21st century.No obvious singles doomed the CD from the start, this despite the fact that all of these songs are mini masterpieces in themselves. Impossible Princess is definitely not for those who got turned onto Kylie for the Fever CD, but for those interested in her entire carreer, the CD is an indispensible chapter."
3,Kylie gets Serious...........,"And it's like a comedy without laughs or a musical without music...it just doesn't feel right to me. I love Kylie because she entertains me.....makes me forget my problems.....raises me up when I'm down........this album is depressing.......it's well done and I'm glad she expiramented and all, but this just really isn't what I want from Kylie. ""Breathe"" and ""Through the Years"" stand out for me, but give me the light and frothy pop of ""Light Year's"" or the hooky pop of ""Fever""....."
5,Kylie returns with another winner,"Despite most Americans perceptions that she was a one-hit wonder with the Locomotion, Kylie has in fact been producing hit after hit since then all over the world. After a more than three year break since her last album and a name change to her album due to the death of a princess in 1997, she comes out with which has to be the best album of her career. Writing all the lyrics herself, this is an album which cannot be described as having one music style. From the drum and bass style of Too Far to the to the world music drums of Cowboy Style and to the very Bjork-ish Limbo, this album album establishes her reputation as the pop chameleon.The album is different compared to her past works, but whatever she did, it sure works.Other tracks worth mentioning include Did it again, Breathe and Drunk."
2,Impossible is an overstatement,"I waited a long time to listen to Impossible Princess. I often find myself listening to Kylie Minogue on days when I'm feeling overly superficial. In fact, superficial is a great way to describe this album.Whilst there are a few songs that I like (Jump, for example), I get the impression that Ms. Minogue is trying too hard to present herself as a credible, introspective song writer. She isn't! Some of these lyrics seem like they were written by a high-school cheerleader who's kitten died after she broke up with her jock boyfriend. These are the kinds of lyrics you would expect from a cushioned suburbanite who saw a film about beat poets and decided to take a stab at it. A disaster, to say the least.I recommend you pick and choose the songs you like, and discard the rest. If you want real talent, go for Nina Persson of the Cardigans ---arguably one of the best lyricists in pop music, today."
2,Not helpful!!,This book is not really that helpful. It's not very 'user-friendly'. The chapters and sections are divided weirdly and the way its written is like listening to a boring lecturer -_-
1,Horrible! Ruined my Coffee.,"I thought I'd try making cafe mochas without the added sugar so I got myself a bottle of this Walden Farms Calorie Free Chocolate Syrup. Bad idea. Just as a few of the other reviewers have said, it does not taste at all like chocolate (not sure what it tastes like, but it sure ain't chocolate) and has a strong, sharp after-taste.Walden Farms Thousand Island Dressing is delicious and their Pancake Syrup is tasty, so I expected this to be pretty good. But no, this stuff is not for me. I have used baking cocoa before, but it often doesn't dissolve well. However, I'd rather have that problem than this one. Horrible tasting product."
3,Gets old fast,"First of all, I think it is amazing that there is such a thing as ""defatted cocoa"", and the product is a good idea despite the fact that it contains ""trace calories"" (check the back of the bottle). However, this does not at all taste like chocolate in my opinion. I couldn't really use it for dipping fruit; I couldn't use it for chocolate milk or chocolate sodas. I have a feeling that this may work if you add it to creamy things like non-diet ice cream. It left a weird after-taste in my mouth, and in general had a chemical taste. I will not buy this product again. I'd rather eat normal chocolate sparingly than this stuff in larger quantities."
2,Eh...,"It's edible. It tastes ok. Bad aftertaste, CERTAINLY does not resemble chocolate AT ALL...but still helps to make some ""failed"" baking attempts edible. Probably not worth the money though. Go with their pancake syrup instead, it's awesome."
4,So good,"I just so happen to pass by this product at the supermarket today and bought it.To try it first, I just poured it onto a teaspoon and tried it straight. Honestly, to me it tasted like chocolate flavored water. That was my first reaction. However, after having my second taste, I deemed it really good for what it is- 0 calorie (I doubt that though) chocolate.Then I decided to mix it into my skim milk. Now THAT was delicious. It tasted like a chocolate milkshake. Obviously it really is meant to be mixed into things. Totally worth it, will buy again!!"
5,Disc full of surprises,"The only piece on here I'd heard before is the Gordon Jacob concerto - and this performance outdistances the other recording by a long shot. Pyatt's technique and musicality are truly impressive. The other pieces were new to me - as were the composers, aside from Arnold. Really, who is Ruth Gipps??? And yet her piece is terrific. I've listened to it a dozen times at least this week. She certainly deserves to be better known and this piece should be out there in the repertoire.All of this music is of such interest that I've been digging to find more of their work, and isn't that a fantastic change?I got this as a gift, and what a terrific gift it was. Highly recommended."
2,I really *wanted* to like this book...,"I love the GA McKevitt books and their plus-sized heroine Savannah Reid (who always has a box of Godivas somewhere nearby. A girl needs her strength.) But McKevitt's mysteries are about the characters themselves. Savannah Reid just happens to be full figured, the books aren't about thin vs. fat. Sadly Ms. Murray's book is more about the fat and less about the mystery. Skinny people are depicted as evil and psychotic whereas the ""large"" folks are all loveable, kind, moral and good. The next book in the Joanne Fuller series rates at least a four, it was funny and interesting, so much so I just ordered the third. :-)"
4,Lovely...what a description for a bucket,"I bought this to keep by my woodstove for kindling. It works like a charm. Deep enough to hold foot-long sticks, wide enough to hold about a week's worth. The galvanized coating is very attractive. The only reason this does not have five stars is that there is a place on the bucket where there was no coating. I looks like a storage or handing issue."
5,Excellent product,Is an excellent product. I use it every day. It's better than the plastic pail because the plastic is always scratched and dirty.
3,Late 90's alternative metal,"Shadows is the 1996 debut album from Chicago metal band Stonehenge. The band played a style of metal that seemed to walk a fine line between doom and alternative metal. It's heavy, Sabbath-inspired stuff, but there are some similarities to Pantera and maybe Soundgarden as well.I have to give the band credit for sticking to their metal guns when metal was decidedly unpopular. That said; I have a hard time getting into this album. I like the overall heaviness, and the lyrics are pretty well-written, but there's not much in the way of melody and the album starts to get a little monotonous about halfway through. Some guitar hooks, breakdowns or anything to pick up the pace a little would have gone a long way.Unless you are already familiar with the band or followed the Chicago metal scene in the late 90's, I can't really recommend Shadows. It's a decent enough album, but doesn't really stand out or hold up well now that the 90's are (thankfully) gone."
3,Dark Tones,"This album is full of well written thought provacotive lyrics. The sound that they achieve here is very dreamy and dark, the overtones just wisk you away. I recommend it!"
2,depressing,"I love Laura Ingalls Wilder as an author. I think her books are interesting and well written. Her descriptions of events, places, people, and time periods cannot be beat and it draws you right in. However, this book is just awful and depressing."
2,"Yes, quite different","I agree with most other reviewers who gave this book two or three stars; it lacked the warmth and charm of the original eight. I missed detailed descriptions of beautiful rooms, homecooked food, and calico-patterned dresses. I missed the quandaries and lessons learned as a part of growing up, the excitement of migrating ever westward, the intimate conversations between Laura and members of her family. I was bored by the financial aspects of her adult life, but loved reading about little Rose's activities and about the farm animals. I felt Laura's first pregnancy and childbirth were handled in a nice respectable way. While I was so dismayed and creeped out by Mr. and Mrs. Boast's proposal, I felt it said something frank about the dark side of human nature. I would recommend The First Four Years for anyone over the age of ten- not because of mature subject matter, but because younger kids might not fully comprehend what they're reading."
4,"Good, but different","This book was good, although it had a different writting style. I heard that it was based on a diary and ghosted by Laura's daughter, Rose. I also heard that Laura wrote it but died before she could edit it. Oh, well. It's still a good end to a great series."
1,obviously not by the same hand,"I set out to read all the books in order during the hot weeks of July. Really enjoyed all the others having read them many years ago. Just a few pages in, I could tell the book was not written by the same hand. Too many cliches in the text. Laura didn't write like that. The richness of the descriptions was missing. Laura never complained so much about work in all the other books combined!! After a few more pages, I googled the book and saw that it was published after Laura's death!!! Not sure why the publishers list Laura as the author. It might be based on Laura's diary, but the voice is in no way Laura's. A guess would be an unknown writer used the short blurbs in the diary as the story outline. A question would be why the diary wasn't destroyed when the house burned??? It would not be the item laura would try to save. It reads like a mediocre children's fiction series written in the 1950's. I am not sure if I will even finish it. what a shame........"
3,Biittersweet end,"This book really is only for die-hard Little House fans. It wasn't published till after Laura and Rose had died, for 'Golden years' was meant to be the end of the Little House series. It's definitely not for little kids, and if your little one is a fan of the series, I wouldn't recommend telling them of this book till they get older, since this has a different feel to the story. I didn't enjoy it as much as the other LH books, but that should be expected with Ms. Wilder's intentions and the fact that this book was a posthumous publication. It's not a bad read on it's own, though, it's just different because it's sadder. Definitely a book for older readers."
3,The end of and era,"This book was not as great as some of the others, BUT after you read the other 8 you have no choice but to read the last. It did leave me wanting more information about the next 4 years. Hmm?"
3,The First Four Years!,"""The First Four Years,"" is a story about the early years of the marriage of Laura Ingalls and Manly Wilder.As the story starts in 1894, Laura agrees to marry Manly and help him try to make a living farming.The young family eventually grows with the birth of baby Rose.The Wilder family faces many trials thoughout there lives. sickness, the harsh climate, and more. Wilder presents the often deadly dangers of pioneer life quite often.There are some dark and harsh moments along the way, but I found this book to be joyful and hopeful. Wilder shows courage of the pioneer farm family."
4,This Book Is Different,"I really agree with the other reviews. This book is different from the others.There is an introduction in the beginning of the book (by the person who personally knew Rose Wilder Lane and wrote the Rose books)that tells us that this book is different from the first books. It's because Laura never intended to publish it. Or maybe she did, but didn't get to. But anyhow, she did not edit it to be published.I read another review that said that the voice of the whole book is different. I totally agree with that statement! It's not like Laura!I think it's a good idea to make this book part of the set, however, because people want to know what happens after Almanzo and Laura get married.This is my advice: Read the other books first!-Gracie G., age 11"
3,The series is probably a little better without this one.,This book doesn't convey the same emotions as all her other books. It actually leaves you feeling a little down. The series is totally complete without it.
3,The first years they are married,"Laura Ingalls has a new name! She has just gotten married to Almonzo Wilder, and is very happy. She has written this book word for word, no one has edited it. It is straight from her diary, and is her exact words. During these first four years, they have many struggles. They have fire, death, hail, and no good crops for four straight years. They also have a major problem with debt. Yet somehow, they stay strong. They get very excited over the newest member of their family. Her name is Rose, their first baby. Through out this book, you can see all the courage, and faith they have to get through each year. This is a good book. It really shows how they had to survive back then."
2,Not Really A 'Little House' Book At All,"The First Four years was released many years after These Happy Golden Years brought a sweet, tidy ending to the series. I did not like this book and it just does not feel like it belongs with the other books. It is about hardship and bitter times and disturbs the harmony of the other titles. I'd recommend serious thought be given before this book is begun."
1,Do not order....,"unless you are into antiques. I was so disappointed when I received this book. Not the book itself, but the condition of it. I looked like someone pulled it out of the attic. The pages were dark yellow and the book smelled moldy. I had to turn around and re-order the book, but not from this seller."
2,Guilty!,"Guilty for being suckered into buying this book! I didn't find the ""free pass off the guilt train"" I was looking for in this dry read. Sorry to say, I'm still feeling guilty about working full time, but I now feel worse for spending my kids inheritance on this book! All in all, common sense outweighs guilt. I know it, I just wanted a book to confirm it.....this one was far from it."
3,Rita's Better Live or on tape,"This book was alright. I love Rudner, and I think most of my enjoyment of the book was because I was able to hear Rita's voice in my head as I read the book. If you can't do that, alot of the humor will likely fall flat. She's definitely got some insight into modern life, and the humor is almost as funny the second time around as it is the first."
5,"A great James Brown production!!! ""In Heat"" by the Dee Felice Trio is quite a jazzy treat!!!","What a great obscure jazz recording!!! ""In Heat"" by the Dee Felice Trio is an awesome jazz album,great drums(Dee Felice),piano(Frank Vincent)and bass(Lee Tucker)!!! My favorite is The Crickets Song with an incredible drum solo by Dee Felice!!!Some great jazzy covers include Oh Happy Day,Wichita Lineman,Both Sides Now,and Summer In The City!!! But the rest of the album is awseome too!!! Great 20-bit remasering!!! And to top it off,its a James Brown(The Funkmaster!) production to boot!!! A keeper!!! Two thumbs up!! Five stars!!! A+"
5,Awesome band! Great CD! Look past the silly band name,"Slobberbone is simply the best unknown band out there. Period. Their first three cd's were amazing and they put on a great live show (you need to see them when they come to your area!). Their latest offering, Slippage, is also a must own and should put the band on the map. So check out Slippage as well as their other offerings (Crow Pot Pie, Barrel Chested and Everything You Thought Was Right Was Wrong Today) - these cd's never leave my disc changer!"
3,Socially Distorted,"Slobberbone's ""Slippage"" treads the same sonic territory previously travelled by such post-punk blues influenced bands as Social Distortion and Jason and the Scorchers. The vocals, in particular, are a dead ringer for Social D. Unfortunately, the songwriting is not universally strong and the album is uneven as a result.The best song here is the closer, ""Back,"" a sweet ballad that ends things on a perfectly somber note. It works much better that most of the hard/fast material on the album, which suffers from a bland sameness, suggesting that Slobberbone's strength lies in the slower stuff. Other standout tracks include the rousing cover of the Bee Gee's sappy standard ""To Love Somebody,"" the slower ""Sister Beams"" and ""Live on in the Dark.""Overall, an uneven album from a gutsy band that should contentrate on playing to their strengths."
2,Streaks glossy screens,"My monitor has a high gloss screen (HP w1907) and my girlfriend has a Matte screen (Dell 1907FP). The wipes really tend to leave a lot of streaks on glossy screens. There's ways to ""clean up"" after the wipes but... isn't that the point of the wipe?Streaking is practically invisible on her matte screen Dell 1907FP. I'll probably give her these wipes and look for something else for my monitor. Overall, the wipes do a fine job cleaning off grime from either surface."
1,Entire Can Dried Up Fast,"Pretty bad product. My entire can dried up after about a month or so even though I keep it closed and sealed. Will never buy again. Even when they were fresh and wet they never really worked that well, very hard to get a screen clean."
1,Completely ineffective,"These left my screen worse than before I used them. I had to use two Endust wipes just to wipe away the lint that these left behind. I wish I hadn't purchased three tubs, because now I will be throwing them all out."
2,No Shelf Life,"I bought this product some time ago (maybe 18 months ago). I used 5-6 wipes in all that time. Now, the product is dry and cannot clean anything. What a waste. If you buy this product, make sure you use all of it quickly. I need something that will last years."
3,ok at first,"When you first open this they work ok, but after about 2 weeks they dry out and are unusable. I would consider trying a different brand."
2,Leaves lint and streaks,You'll need to clean your screen after using this product. Seriously!Useful for removing grease or mud though. Your breath and a microfiber towel will work better on small screens like smartphones.
4,Great Watch! Crap postal service...,"I love the watch, its really great looking and light and the functions seem to work really well! Also it cost me about half what it would have cost to buy it here in Australia! My only complaint is that it cost me over $100 for what i thought would be a great postal service and the man that delivered it left it on my door step on a busy street all day! I didn't even have to sign for it!! It was just lucky it was still there when i got home from work. But i'd recommend the watch!"
4,Q&A Review for Medical Assistant (Prentice Hall),"Book was perfect! Exactly what I needed to study for my MA certification test. However, I didn't read the small print carefully enough and didn't realize the book did NOT come with the CD. However, still able to study with the book."
5,The most challenging CMA preparation textbook,"I was studying for my CMA exam from 3 different sources and this one was the most challenging. I can honestly say that I passed the test (a week ago- yey!) thanks to this awesome book! The questions are the hardest out of many textbooks (my other two sources were actually newer textbooks), it has a CD with bunch of practice tests as well.Go for it!UPDATEp.s. I just found out I passed with 99% score - I have to contribute a lot of that to this book!"
1,Agree the book is crap.,This book has a lot of percentages wrong. I mean what should I trust my text or this book? Just because the book has a lot of information doesn't mean it will help unless the information is correct. I am going to get a Lippincott's instead. Their reviews seem better and it is by the same person who wrote my book.
1,This book is crap,The CD ROM that comes with this book doesn't work and the 400 question practice test doesn't exist. There is a LOT of incorrect information in this book and mis-information. Avoid this book at all costs.
2,Philosophy of Religion,After going to class for the first time I found that the book is not the second edition as described online.
3,Not too popular,"I have a daycare with 5 kids under the age of 5. While a cute idea, the beetle is a little hard to understand once the kids get to playing with it. I usually have to repeat what the beetle is telling them to do. They loose interest really quickly. We have more fun playing Simon Says... (Myself being Simon!) I have to say tho, it is very sturdy. It has been thrown on the floor MANY times and it still works!"
2,The Fun Only Lasted For One Day!,"After seeing a friends son open this gift at a birthday party, I quickly ordered it for my 22 month old daughter. When it arrived, I put the batteries in and gave it a go. My daughter really enjoyed pushing the yellow button and the hand to make the beetle give different directions. She seemed able to follow most of the instructions although I think it goes a little fast. When we went to play with the toy the following day, the beetle had gone crazy! It kept spinning and giving nonsense directions and basically saying everything it had programmed into it. I did what the directions said to do in case of malfunction and replaced the batteries, but it still would not work properly. I had actually ordered 2 of the beetles to give one as a gift and I took the second one out of the box and tried it as well. The second one did not work either. The concept of this toy is wonderful, but it is not durable at all and it is not any fun having a toy that does not work."
3,Great voice! But what is she SAYING??,"Interesting woman and a beautiful contralto voice leads me to believe those who can understand Farsi must love her, but otherwise pretty inaccessible for the rest of us. Some of the instrumentals make me think of a noisy street market in Karaj, but the microtonal scales she comfortably rocks while less familiar are beautiful."
1,Tries to teach everything but doesn't teach much,"This book is supposed to teach you network design and admin, amongst other things including basic computer knowledge, in just 24 hours. If that is possible, all those network designers and administrators out there will be out of a job very soon.The only saving grace is that a bit of everything pertinent to networking is covered. For me, that's still insufficient reason to read the book."
2,A Childhood Favorite Improperly Updated,"Parsley the Horse was one of my favorite childhood books, along with Ping, but the reissue disappointed. it's paperback and has no color. Still, if you've never experienced the book, buy this one. it's better than missing Parsley altogether."
1,When awful is not a strong enough word,"I rented this and what can I say? Well... you can't use that type of language here at Amazon but I'll just go with it...Awful acting? Check.Awful story? Check.Awful direction? Check.Awful villian? Check.Awful chemistry? Check.Awful ending? Check.To have this movie as a 3.5 star average and to even have ONE five star rating is a crime against God, humanity, and cinema... and maybe not in that order. If you are the brainless sort that finds Fear Factor to be ""good television"" then by all means, buy this NOW."
2,It's OK,"I was sure that it would be really scary; however I was wrong. It is one of those movies which do not raise your heartbeat and do not have any real special effects. You can buy it maybe for your DVD collection, bout do not pay too much."
4,Good Flick,"I work at blockbuster so I just got the movie in today, Good look to the dvd I only wish their was more in it, all their is, is a few trailers and a sneak peak of the making of saw, also a music video. I was kinda hoping that we'd be able to see the uncut version of the movie. I don't know tho the movie is great tho perfect choice great thriller for the remotely intelligent people."
1,This is a stupid movie,"Ok, this movie is so stupid. It is not a scary movie AT ALL. It was boring, predictable, and only had a few moments that were really suspenseful. I can't believe that there's been three sequels from this movie. I mean, come on!!"
3,"Blood, Guts, Poor Ending","Short and sweet. I knew what was going on before I got to the end but did not tell the person I was with so it does not count.See if you can figure it out....so, from that point...yea....check it out but as for artistic capability, life enriching material or in thing other than blood guts and the endless insanity of Psychotic Killers either not on their medication or tired of prescribing it.......okay....give it a try.I left feeling empty and dissapointed at the totality of all this suspense flop has to offer.Although I will give it a thumbs up on blood and gore."
2,This movie is a waste of your time,to me this movie looked great in the previews and I always enjoy horror movies that critics give bad ratings to. But I agree with them this time. At first I thought I was going to sleep with the light on until I saw the ending. THE ENDING IS....... THERE ISN'T A REAL ENDING JUST A VICTIM BEING LOCKED IN A DARK ROOM. If you want to see a scary movie this isn't one to see unless you only like to watch the beginning of movies
2,Saw is a stupid movie!,"Saw has to be one of the dumbest movies you could watch. I understand the point, but they don't emphasize the point enough. The movie should be about a mad man killing people, but he doesn't kill anyone. The people kill themselves in the movie. So it is really a dumb movie."
1,Horrible.......Disturbing........Too Much,"Wow, movies today are getting more repulsive and disgusting by the minute. No wonder we have so much teenage violence. This movie goes way too far as far as blood and gore goes. I mean, we dont need to watch some guy sawing his leg off and getting shot in the head. Directors are just trying anything they can to get a rise out of people these days, its pathetic. Save your money."
2,orignal was much better....,"I saw this in distribution. I actually had to turn my head at certain points. This, along with Trent Reznor's soundtrack made for a great splatter flick. I thought the uncut version could only be better.....WRONG. It is not nearly as tense and nerve-racking as the theater version. Plus, they have replaced Reznor's soundtrack with something else. In this case, the orginal was much better. Be warned!"
4,Saw is a must see!,"One of the most gruesome and horrifying films of the past two years, Saw engages the viewers in random acts of torture.The movie stars Cary Elwes (Robin Hood: Prince Of Tights) and Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon), and the film's screenwriter Leigh Whannell.Elwes and Whannell wake up chained from their ankles in a broken restroom with a dead body lying down before their eyes with a cell phone in one hand and a gun in the other. It turns out that a psychopathic maniac known only as Jigsaw is testing their will to live only if they abide by some the most grotesque rules of the 'game'.Saw fared well at the box office. It also proved to be an entertaining modern day horror film that many people disregarded as being part of Hollywood's latest trend and fetish with trashy horror flicks.For its creativity, Saw is a must see!RecommendedB"
3,Eh...,"It was a decent horror movie. I psyched myself out for this disgusting amazingly scary film, but i completely over-psyched myself. This is a grade C mystery, not a gory horror movie. The acting was incredibly cheezy, and there was nowhere near the amount of terror i expected. There were no parts in which i jumped, no parts where i grabbed my stomach in disgust. HOWEVER:This movie is worth seeing once, because the ending is AMAZING. But to all my fellow horror fans, see it once, but dont get your expectations too high. If you want real gory horror, check out the 1974 version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's a classic."
2,It could have been better,"There were some things that didn't make sense in this movie. For starters, the Asian cop who was killed in that house of horrors. You would think there would be a major criminal investigation in that place. But no. Nothing. And why did they go alone instead of calling for backup? That didn't make sense. Another thing, we're to believe these people are being put through all this because of something bad they've done in their lives but the two main characters in the film who are chained up have done nothing wrong. The doctor was going to have an affair but he didn't. The other guy who works at the hospital...well there weren't any questions answered about him. I can't bring up the biggest problem in the movie without giving the ending away. All in all, the movie was all right. I liked the set up but it lacked suspense and the plot just didn't make sense."
3,Starts out more promising than it ends.,"Saw is a movie that starts out stylish and smart and gets silly and dumb before it ends. When watching the beginning and middle I thought ""how could Richard Roeper call this one of the worse movies of 2004"". Then as it gets closer to the end I thought ""ok I get it now, that's why"". Carey Elwes (Kiss the Girls) gives about the same bad performance that Kim Basinger did on Cellular. It's overly dramatic and just laughable. Still entertainly laughable at least.Anyway the movie is about a killer who gets people to kill themselves trying to escape. They are people who have wanted to kill themselves and he gets them to fight to try to live. The movie is entertaining through-out even if it does lose it's touch a little at the end. It starts out as a good mystery/horror film and becomes just laughably bad entertaining at the end. Still it is a lot better than most recent horror films that came out recently."
4,gross,This is probably the best one of the series.It's a very gory and realistic movie in terms of visuals. It will make your stomach turn and your hand will cover your face in shock and disgust.
2,Saw,"This film is far from being one of the scariest movies (ever).Whether you do not care about the plot and acting and you just want to enjoy, take it. However, if you want to see a good made Horror movie, I'm afraid Saw's not for you. The acting is bad (That Adam guy - God bless him, I laughed my head off every time he opened his mouth), the plot doesn't make sense and there's nothing psychological in it or whatsover. It's here where Saw fails and makes you laugh insted of being scared. It's not that is a horrible movie, but watching it, you just don't care much. Well, I didn't anyway. The story wasn't shown in a credible way so you could have the chance to sympathize with the characters."
2,Very Disappointed,"I have to say that I am very disappointed with the way Saw turned out. I have been waiting for a long time for this movie to come out and I was let down. For one the acting was horrible, the screen play wasn't great and it just wasn't scary, at all. The whole movie looked low budget, which it was, but they could have done a better job with it. The only redeeming things about the movie are the premise, which is great, and the ending, which had a twist. Other then that, not good, if you want to see it, wait till DVD, it not worth seeing in theaters, I'm sad to say."
3,I love fear on your face...,"It was a geneously nerve pinching movie, acting was tiring at times but Leigh Whannell's performance in the last two minutes of the film was orgasmic, you can't beat seeing that kind of true-intense fear on a cute guys face. I would recommend it to a select audience but enforce the fact that it's a good nighttime movie. You aren't afraid of the dark are you?"
3,Modern day thriller doesn't compare with the classics..,"Can't believe I'm the first person to review this film... I really don't know what to think. It's one of those movies that when it is over you think ""now why didn't I pay more attention the first time."" Without giving the ending away I did wonder about this one character..... Don't think I'd ever watch it again. Frankly I prefer Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers to this one. Very gory and hard to follow the story line. Probably this movie is for viewers under the age of 30 that are used to modern day gore. Sorry!"
3,"An O.K. thriller, nothing great.","The movie did have a few good scenes, yet I found the ending unsatisfying and even disappointing and also, there are some obvious inconsistencies in the story line."
4,Great story concept!,"Sometimes the mind has tunnel vision. But details need to be ingrained.""Saw"" is a no bones, graphic crime thriller. Knowing that going into view this film can only lead to predictable assumptions. Who is the Killer? That question is always in the viewer's mind. As a side note: Your first instinct is usually right!Director James Wan plays with those viewer's assumptions. ""Saw"" is about a sadistic serial killer with a conscience on changing his victim's outlook. This is a great story with many twists and options to play with as a scriptwriter. Will you make a drastic decision to save your life?""Saw"" starts out with a great premise but ends with the believable factor. How much time would it take to set up these elaborate scenarios with life choice decisions? The plot is intertwined in massive coincidence of circumstances. The inept detectives (Danny Glover/Ken Leung) round out the mislead manhunt. Hopefully the sequel will be better. But worth viewing to find out who is the killer!"
3,Not bad,"It was pretty good. I would consider it more of a gory thriller, rather than horror. Nevertheless, an entertaining movie, definitely worth the watch. But, as with most u.s./canada releases, this was not the 'real' movie you want to watch. Unfortunately, the original had to be edited so it could go down from nc-17 to R rating...yes, it was originally that gory. None of us in the u.s. got to see the original uncut version, and even worse, its not even available on dvd....stateside!! Luckily, our mates in the uk DID get to see the uncut version in their theatres, and its also available on dvd (region 2, PAL). This is the one that you guys wanna see, this was the one that was meant to be released originally: http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007LEJNQ/qid=1111053552/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/026-4620663-2158002"
3,"good thriller, kinda gorey","ok i watched this once and was somewhat distracted but this is a good somewhat intelligent thriller that was inspired by how ""dark"" it was by ""seven"" (but does not really copy it), it could have been directed great but missed the mark because some of the acting was bad, had bad flow in certain spots, too much gore was shown, and a couple unanswered questions (don't tell me saw 2 is coming soon?? :P).. where the movie wins is the overall suspense, but again it could have been done much better.."
2,who makes these movies?????,"O.k.I love how hollywood pumps up the hype on all these lame "" SO CALLED HORROR FLIMS!"" 2 guys in a room for a long time, Wow scary!! GO get SHAUN OF THE DEAD OR BUBBA HO-TEP! those are the only cool FUN movies out in a long time! Oh the new Texas chainsaw re-make was damn cool too."
3,"pretty good, but the gore comes in way after it should have.","When you see it you will know what I am talking about, the goriest part was just absolutely pointless.So other than than it was a mildly entertaining movie.One of the main problems I had with this movie is not setting up danny glover's character, this was just stupid in my opinion.Also the guy running the game was also kind of stupid when you learn all that is going on. i think the movie would be better if they left some things untold and better involvement for the smaller characters would have helped.Overall gore when they didn't need it, a lot of wholes, and the fact that I never got that tension feeling I was looking for from the 2 main character.Other than that, it was pretty entertaining, rent it don't buy it."
5,Intense Stuff,"I was so shocked and absorbed the first time I saw this film. It was really good. I actually jumped at a few times. I wish I saw this in theaters instead of The Grudge (Not really good). The characters and story were really good all the way through the spellbinding ending. The actors are great in their roles especially Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, and newcomer Leigh Whannell (he also wrote the screenplay). Saw is a tour de force and gives a new edge on a thriller. Highly Recommended."
3,"Entertaining, But Not Much Else","""Saw"" is movie about a serial ""killer"", who doesnt actually kill his victims himself, he finds ways for his victims to kill themselves. Which is actually a pretty interesting idea, and this movie had tons of potential. But its bogged down by marginal acting and holes in the plot. I really cant elaborate on the holes in the plot because it would give away the ending, but in the end you really dont get any resolution or closure. This is a decent movie to just sit around and watch with your friends, but dont expect anything oscar worthy."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Saw begins promisingly by thrusting the viewer into a dirty basement with the two main characters, but quickly builds up so many plot holes that a good deal of the sequels' running lengths are devoted to clearing them up; if you like your horror leavened awful acting and nonsensical plotting, by all means check out Saw."
3,Cool Idea,"I really liked the premise of this movie and understand why it spawned a sequel, but what about that terrible acting!?! Everyone in the movie seemed to be 'phoning in' their performance. This movie was fairly original and disturbing, but just think how good it could have been."
3,Grotesque movie with an interesting story...,"Saw is a pretty grotesque story yet had an intriguing story. In the movie, Jigsaw kidnaps people and sets them up in things that force them to hurt themselves in order to escape, or else they die in some way. The story of this movie is interesting, but it is pretty disgusting to me when the characters inflict pain on themselves. That stuff just turns me off and I was very grossed out by this. Other then that, if you don't mind that then you should like this movie a lot as it has a good story and a lot of gore."
2,EXCELLENT TRAILER POOR MOVIE...........,"Firstly Yes the Movie Looked Excellent On the Trailer, But Like Lots Now adays, It the Old saying Great Trailer Bad Flim. The Review say Lots of Blood and Shocking Moments.. But after the First 10 Minutes, the Once Scary Movie turns into a Guy telling a Story about this serial Killers and few murders he did, Which ain't really scary at all...If this Film Class as being shocking Or Blood fill, then I must of fell asleep when i was watching it.Unless you count Blood on the Floor as Gore.. Ok At the End there finally a Moment of Eyes closing when the Saw is Used, But that's 15 Seconds, All you see is a guy with a cloth in His Mouth..Coming to the End, i thought i was watching the usual suspects...........If you want to watch a Thriller, then watch this...if you want to watch REAL HORROR MOVIE...Then WatchClassic *Silence of the Lambs.."
1,Crapfest 2004,"Lame. This movie debuts at #1 on the 2004 Craplist. It tries to much to be like ""Seven"" and ""The Usual Suspects"" and falls short of even effectively duplicating the plot twists and surprises of those two films. I wanted both my time and money back. I would escape by sawing MY leg off if I was chained to a floor in a dank room and forced to watch this movie over and over again. And if you didn't pick up on what was going to happen in the first five minutes, like what the title meant, then you're an idiot who provides a market for brainless films with bad acting and sensationalized plots and idiotic violence. I'm sorry, but this movie SUCKED!"
2,BORING,"I was all excited about watching this movie, thinking it would great, scary, suspenseful, etc.Boy was I disappointed!I mean-not only was the plot ""corny"", but the acting wasn't very good either.I was literally yawning as I watched it.The last scary movie that I watch recently was ,""The Grudge""-now THAT movie was great!Extremely suspenseful, great plot, excellent acting, and scary.I felt I wasted my time watching,""SAW."""
2,Split a little more blood,"No, please. This is blood in the name of suspense. This has gone really far.Let's see. Is it NECESSARY to spoil a not bad plot with so much blood? I was really interested in what was the reason of such a game. I am giving two stars because the thing is original overall. But the interest is soon forgotten as you take more care in find out if some blood has splitted over you.And this is not the only bad thing. It is very annoying to see Danny Glover in such an awful role. When actors are getting older they must have a decent job. It is simple: look at what ""Lethal Weapon"" was. Mel Gibson has really improved his roles. Danny Glover has gone worse...Even if you have a well-formed stomach this is no good for you... if you have a well-formed brain."
1,Waste neither time nor money on this crap,"This movie was a waste of time and energy. Filled with pointless, disturbing violence, it was made only worse by a flakey storyline and irritating characterisation. It just made no sense! Come on! a sick man in hospital organising gruesome killings so that the victims learn to appreciate life. Then he's lying still for over 7 hours pretendng to be dead (the guy with his brains blown out) so he observe his victims. Then at the end of the film he walks out of the room. This movie was sick, and I suspect only sickos would appreciate it. Why isn't it possible for people to ban these kinds of movies in the first place, - that glorify filth, murder & moral degeneration? An ungenerous review for a morally depraved and ungenerous film."
3,Not horrible.,"This movie should have been better. There are some good ideas here but, as a whole, the movie doesn't quite hold together. It never feels quite sure of itself. Saw is creepy now and then, when it's not beating you over the head with its creepiness. It makes the movie Seven (a much better movie) seem downright wholesome, taking grimey ambiance to new lows.Where this film really fails is in communicating any sense of real urgency or in creating any sustained tension. These failings are noticable immediately when we see how quickly our two ""protagonists"" adapt to their grim circumstance. The climax falls completely flat with events unfolding in such a way as to diminish the tension rather than build it.All things considered, this thriller is better than most coming out these days. It is inventive and is generally entertaining. There are even some genuininely scary moments. Give this one a rent."
5,Best of the series,"The first movie is the best, there is very little blood. It's mostly a psychological thriller. You will be shocked at the end. The others in the series became gore fests, no real writing in them."
5,BRILLIANT!! GENIUS!!!,"If you like horror - or, you are a critic, such as myself - this is an ABSOLUTE MUST SEE!!!!! The only HORROR films, that rival ""SAW I - VI"", are ""SEVEN"" and, of course, ""Silence Of The Lambs""!! The only thing scarier, or more intriguing, is - What you're of mind comes up with this???? Where horror film ratings are concerned, this is an EASY 10........"
5,Makes you think!,"Not just a slasher! Really makes you think and piece it all together! Great horror/psychological thriller! I convinced a friend to see it, and it becomes about the who is doing what rather than the blood and gore."
4,"A great drama, not a great horror movie","""Saw"" is a better movie than most people give it credit for, mostly, I believe, because most people judge it as a horror movie. There aren't a lot of flashy special effects and there is little which passes for gore. Fans of ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" will definitely consider this a substandard horror movie. However, for those who enjoy watching a theatric puzzle come together, like in ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"", this movie should prove suspenseful enough to keep your attention for the duration. This is one of those movies where you actually have to pay attention to what is going on and what is being said. If you care about the quality of your movies, you'll enjoy this one."
5,SAW it and LOVED it.,"Where do i beging? Man this movie is the best movie ive seen so far. its scary, its thrilling, its funny, its just plain awesome. Now for does who have read that this movie is kinda like ""seven"" let me explain. The only reason people are compering this movie to seven is the fact that the killer in this one whants to teach a sick moral lesson. Thats the ONLY thing these movies have in comen !!!!!!"
4,Raw and creepy...ending will freek you out,"Plot is a bit sloppy but if you like ""B"" thrillers you should love this one. Not for everyone and not I what I expected, but like it or not you will be talking about the ending for quite a while."
4,This psychopath could give Hannibal Lector nightmares.,"""Saw"" is the suspense horror film to buy on DVD for this first quarter of 2005. After hearing mixed opinions about the movie, I felt that there was only one thing to do, ..see the movie for myself. I wasn't among those that were disappointed. Although the acting was a bit rusted (not by all), it was easily tolerable. The film had plenty of suspense, chills, and thrills around every unexpected twist and turn. Sure, there are those who knew what was going to happen next, but did they really? I found the idea of the movie fresh. I welcomed each intense moment. I'm not much on breaking things down in a movie review. I just recommend them or not. In this case I recommend ""Saw"" to those who like well paced horror. However, if movies like ""The Grudge"" scare you. Avoid this and save money on a therapy bill."
1,Awful,"This was probably one of the most disappointing movies I've ever watched, especially with all the hype surrounding it. My friends insisted that this was a horrifying movie, and they were right- just not in the way I expected. The only horrifying thing about this movie is the acting done by a tired and bloated looking Cary Elwes. Past that, the movie just doesn't make any sense. And so far as the plot twists that so impressed my friend, they're juvenile and easy to guess or just silly. Wait for this one to come out on a premium cable channel and save your money."
1,Very Bad,"This movie is horrible.Its not even worth 1 star.This plot is so overused, I mean if you like this at least watch Seven you might view Saw differently, I could tell a couple college kids wrote it in 2 weeks its a simple formula for money which is a big part what the movie industry is about, but comon now.But I am going to give it a star, not as a horror movie but a comedic attempt at a horror movie, some of the scenes are friggin hillarious in retrospect, recommended for a good laugh."
1,"what is it about? I don't care to know, so don't tell me","this film is doesn't make sense, so it starts where two guys are locked up, it's doesn't build up at all, there already there at the beginning. I like certain things to build up, not cut to chase that soon, but I don't like certain things to build up too long, it's got to be just right. terrible ending, worse than ""War of the Worlds"" Ed Wood probably made better thrillers than this bloodbath crap. how does movie even in a genre, it's not horror nor suspense, it's bloodbath crap. Cary Elwes what happened to great lines like ""hey great gift dad"""
3,"Johnny boy has done it again, this time it's a scrubber","It's a shame that every single producer passed on this film in Austalia. The Australian film industry is primarily concerned with cultural identity, therefore it tends to overlook minor details such as profitability. This is not a brilliant film, but it is good and it has made a ton of money. All of Whannell's influences are transparent, which is not necessarily a bad or good thing.I have a sneaking suspicion that the idea for the film could have been inspired by the final scene of Mad Max where Johnny has the option of sawing his leg off or dying, because I know Whennell a big fan of The Road Warrior."
2,"Great Movie, Horrible Picture Quality",This movie has a great plot but as it was one of the first released titles on Blu-Ray it has poor picture quality. If you want to show off your new blu-ray player try to get some of the more recently released titles as they have much better picture quality.
3,A Missed Chance,"This film could have been so much better. As a die hard horror fan I thought this movie had a lot to offer. The story although it borrowed from Seven was still fairly interesting, and the mood was very creepy. The acting however, particulary in the last act falls completely apart. In the theater everyone started laughing that's how bad it got. It's really a shame though, this one had potential. A true blue horror film with an R rating and no cutesy teens. I've heard that much of the acting sucked because the budget didn't allow for any second takes and most of what made it into the film were more like practice takes than real takes. It's really a shame that a jackass like Michael Bay can secure millions for junk like Pearl Harbor and Armageddon, and the creators of Saw couldn't even finish their movie the right way."
1,Ridiculous,"Creepy movie for sure but not creepy enough... The film begins out with promise and then falls apart miserably in the final 1/3 of the movie. The ridiculous sub-plot with Danny Glover was embarassing to watch. The 'who dunnit' becomes weak and fails as the writers seemingly ran out of ideas and just slapped together some mess of an ending. At times there was good suspense and some scenes were scary - but in the end, the film falls short of its goal."
4,Best the first time around!,"This is one of the movies where after you watch out the first time its not really good anymore. I say that because after you watch it and find out everything, out loses its suspense the second time around. If you have never seen this you MUST check out it, out is an absolute for any horror fan!"
3,lossy audio and mpeg2 -- pass on purchasing until a re-issue,"1. Saw is one of the early blu-ray releases, so it's a single-layer (25GB) disc. It uses a high bit-rate MPEG2 encoding, which just can't keep up with some of the finer details and fast camera moves. As such, it looks a little better than what you would see on your HD satelite service.2. While the DTS-ES track is nice, it's still lossy audio. Given how dialogue driven this film is, this isn't too big of a deal.If this bluray is on super-sale (<$8), and you LOVE the film, go for it. Otherwise, I would just record it on your DVR from whatever satelite/fiber HD service you have and watch that until a re-issued bluray with VC-1 and DTS-HD master audio comes out."
3,Pretty Good little Horror Flick,"I will say that, aside from carey elwes and that other guy's performances (the photographer), this movie is really good and is actually pretty scary. One of the best endings in a long time, too, maybe since the Sixth Sense, and it was nice to see Danny Glover in a creepy role for a change. It's too bad it's now going to have 30 sequels and will become a complete joke. I hate hollywood."
4,"good for Halloween, after that, loses its luster","what would you do if you wake up in a room, chained to a pipe, with a dead guy that blew his brains out in the middle. Meet Lawerence and Adam, they wind up in a really bad bathroom, with only no clue of how they got there. They try to piece together the clues and find out who would put them in that bathroom. The only way they can escape is by cutting their foot off.good movie, good directing, mediocore acting, and a interesting screenplay"
5,"smart clever twisted , without explanation but who cares?",who cares it got 48% in rottentomatoes?great filmgood story lineyou will never find out what happen in the endbut If you watch this film againit might not be entertainment as first timebut you might find some interesting scene
3,Special Features?,"The movie is great, the picture is awesome. Only issue is that there are no special features. If there are, then there must be a puzzle to find them 'cause it's not there."
5,Psychological thriller!,This movie will keep you guessing right till the very end. Not for anyone with a weak stomach - you will definitely be doing some wincing! This is one case where I hope that life does not imitate art!
5,"Sick, twisted, and awesome","I didn't know what to expect when I went to see this movie, but I'm glad that I did. If you like sick and twisted psychological thrillers, then you will like this movie. There is no way you can figure out the ending. There are so many twists and turns in this movie. Even when the movie is over you will be asking yourself questions. It's good, really really good."
3,ending could have been alot better,"i've been waiting a long time to see this movie. well i just went and saw it but i was about as satisfied as when you order a pepperoni pizza and get it with no cheese. i thought the storyline was phenomenol, the acting was good although i think dr. gordons character by the end will have some audiences laughing, but the ending leaves you knowing that it was just for shock value.Spoilers ahead!!at the end of this movie we find out that the killer was just another pawn to the real killer. but then we have to find out who that killer was. i think that the ending should have just been left at that and let the audience make up their own suspectsjust a thought."
2,Poor Quality,"I agree with the first poster, the quality is not much better than a standard DVD. Its very grainy is many spots too."
3,For those who want more of the same.....,"I enjoyed the movie and if you did too, I would recommend reading books by Richard Laymon. In specific a book called In the Dark, but really any of his other books have the same kind of perverse twistedness of Saw."
3,O.K Movie,"Good movie doesnt really get boring which is a good thing. But in a sense it is a bite off of ""SEVEN"" and some other movie but i cant remember. I wont go into detail but, its an ok movie. Im a big fan of 70's and 80's horror some 60's a majority of my collection horror atleast is like I said 70' and 80's so alot of this new stuff does not appeal to me much, at all. I did buy it from best buy cause it was only $14.99 whcih is not bad and I will watch it again from time to time on rare occasion, i more or less really brought just because I like to collect DVD's and it is good enough to buy. If you want a movie with a similar plaot and IMO just way better ,Buy the movie ""SEVEN"" which is one of the newer late 90 movies that i actually think is an excellentaction/thriller/horror."
3,Best of the 3 Movies...,"""Saw"" is by far the best of the 3 ""Saw"" movies. It has suspense, was very unpredictable, and had creative murder sequences. They should have stopped with this one though because Saw II and Saw III are horrible."
2,Not good but it's not bad but the acting is just horriable,This movie was not bad but it wasnet good either it's just there. The acting was really bad and I mean bad it's funny to watch them act becouse you dont believe them at parts and you want to tell them to get acting lessons. The story is ok about two men changed to the wall and they have to saw there arms or legs off to survive. The film has lots of pointless charactors and the film i found draged on at times. The film did have some disterbing and scary moments and the ending was pretty good. Overall it;s worth to watch once but it's not great or good and not as good as people where saying it was.
1,Keep looking for a different movie at the store,"I want my money back, this was one of those movies that in the first 15 min you know you have made a bad investment. Figure it takes 30 min to make money at a job to rent this but it takes 100 min to watch it, now you have totally wasted 130 min of your life. Watch the Exorcist or even Barney instead you will be more pleased with the end result. Only thing it had going for it was the last 4 minutes which I will not give away. But it was the best minutes out of the whole experience. Maybe they could just rent a dvd with 4 minutes on it of the ending?? I might have been more willing to pay for that."
2,Disc is loose in case,"We haven't watched the movie and I'm hoping it isn't scratched. It's loose in the case. Not been opened. Here's hoping it will be watchable!! I know it isn't your fault, but I'm just kinda worried about scratches. It's wrapped for now. I can't watch movies like these because they scare the s*** out of me, but my husband likes horror movies. Thanks!"
2,Gripping? Intelligent? Surprising? Genuinely Ingenious?,"To quote the back of the DVD case:""Gripping, Intelligent, Surprising and Genuinely Ingenious""Insert a ""NOT"" in front of each of those words for a more accurate description...The initial sequences show promise, but the film quickly regresses into a sea of plot holes and predictable scenes with horrible acting to boot.Not once did I feel any emotion for any of the characters or experience any sense of tension from the ""Horrific Game Of Survival"".Why the high price on the DVD as well?"
1,terrible movie,la verdad que esto es un insulto para las personas...una pelicula...por demas sangrienta....con un argumento...terrible...pesimas actuaciones....realmente..hubiera preferido .. no verlasalduos
2,oh lame...,"This movie looks totally stupid. I agree with the other reviewers, this is just a lame wannabe version of SEVEN. It tries and wants so hard to be ""arty"" or ""crazy"" that it just isn't. Silence of the Lambs was better. For a Halloween movie, Nightmare before Christmas is still much better. This is like a lame, ridiculous stereotype of the genre. Boo, indeed. Just another attempt to squeeze money out of a Holiday while putting no real feeling into a film."
2,"Okay movie , great premise , flawed ending",At first I really enjoyed this movie but the last half was okay and the ending was so excrucitaingly awful I fealt like I wasted an hour and a half just for a stupid ending like that.
2,They should have calld it something different.,"After i rented it I went up to people and went ""I saw Saw!"" It sounded stupid i dont like repeating myself like that because you know I like have a really big vocabulary and that makes i tlook like I have a really small one. it was even when the other person said ""i saw saw 2"" because then I like couldn't tell if they saw saw too or saw Saw 2 you know it was totally confusing. It was like this one time at work because i'm a waiter you know and well, this dude told me hed give me a big tip but when i wnet to his table after he left I just found this note that said ""give better service"" i mean, WTF? that wasnt nice. and Where was the tip you know? i hate that dude.Anyway the movies pretty cool i guess. i liked Hostel better though it was rad"
4,Hell of A Good Time,"Saw is the most disturbingly entertaining film of the year. It delivers scares,laughter,and gore.What more can you ask for.Saw is sort of falls under the category that the exciting thriller Seven is under.The film is less phsycological than Seven and fast paced. Saw is nasty,dark,gritty,and it doesn't get any better than this. The films suspence will have you on the edge of your seat. This film is totally unpredictable and will satisy you by the end of the film. If you love horror and mystery this is the film to go see. Live or die its your choice."
5,INTENSE!!!,"The title of my review says it all. This movie wasn't really that scary to me, but it was very disturbing and of course intense. I liked all the different traps that the killer used to lure his prey into killing themselves. Sure it borrowed a lot from Seven (I half expected Kevin Spacey to show up at the end) in it's mood and the reasons for killing what seems like normal people. The only downside side is the acting by the two guys in the room chained to the pipes. The acting by the two is fairly good through the first half of the film, but it gets worse when they are in panic mode. The ending blew me away and easily makes up for the small flaws of the film. The Jigsaw killers final line in the film will be mine as well. GAME OVER!"
3,"Good idea, bad acting","This movie centers on the idea that most people take their lives for granted and don't care how they treat others or even themselves. But a new serial killer on the loose is trying to change their minds. The killer puts people in situations that require a major moral dilemma in order for them to live. Sadly, the actors in this movie don't seem to be able to portray any of their emotions on a convincing level and that takes away from the movie. It is still worth renting though and perhaps even seeing 'Saw II' which is coming soon to the movie theaters."
2,too gory,"i usually like slasher movies, but not this gory and intense. danny glover is a better actor in the field of comedy, while the dark-haired guy has no business acting, period. other than that, the movie was pretty origional and well- thought out."
4,Gory Goodness!,"I'm not much of a movie buff, but I do like Mystery-Suspense-Thriller type movies. ""SAW"" is one of the best movies of that genre that I've seen in a long time. It starts off with a bang, and ends with a bigger bang! It has lots of gore if you like that. But most importantly, it makes you think and wonder about how things came about...all your questions might not be answered but hey, it's a highly entertaining movie, with a super cool ending, in my opinion!"
1,ANYONE WHO LIKES THIS NEEDS TO HAVE A LOBOTOMY!,You heard me! This movie sucks. Everything about it is stupid. This film is disgusting. It is polution to your mind to watch this. Stay away.
1,Irksome,"Do you like characters, interesting dialogue, and a solid plot? Keep looking. This was the cinematic equivalent to a hard punch in the stones.I won't give the plot away, since a movie this gimmicky is (even more) worthless without its trifle ""surprises,"" but I'm disappointed director James Wan let the only two Asian characters face such trite fates.Bah. The whole thing was trite. I hated this movie."
1,Good movie......but stupid ending,"This movie is interesting, and a lot different from typical horror movies. The storyline made sense up until the ending revelation. The ending is totally illogical. It is an extremely stupid attempt to prevent you from guessing the real motive of the killer.If you were disappointed with the ending of Dawn of the Dead, then you'll most likely be disappointed with this movie's ending outcome."
1,not what i ordered,"I purchased this item at a very good price but when I got it , it wasnt what the picture said it was."
1,Looks like a made-for-tv movie,I saw this movie for the first time on the SciFi channel. It is so poorly filmed that it could've been a made-for-tv movie. They must have had a very low budget to make it.
1,Not as great as everyone says..,"I was told by several people at work that this was the best horror movie that they had seen in a long while. Based on their opinions, I went and bought the special edition. After viewing 'Saw' I came to the conclusion that it was one of the silliest movies, horror or otherwise, that I had seen in quite some time. Firstly, it's not scary in the slightest. Gory does not equal scary in my book. Also there were several unintentionally funny scenes in the movie. The silly mask that 'Jigsaw' wears was just one thing that made me laugh. If you're a connoiseur of horror movies as I am, I would recommend 'Saw' for a good laugh but nothing else. I don't think I'll listen to the people I work with anymore."
3,Amazing. Suspense.,"Wow, I am surprised I could sleep well the night after I saw Saw... lol... I love the gore and the puzzle ideas. I sometimes sit alone and think of other puzzles that would be interesting to think about. I think that the ending was well thought out and wonderful. Twisted Pictures is so da bomb."
3,Sadistic fun,"Perhaps, Saw isn't a movie that I will add to my movie library any time soon. Be that as it may, it no doubt asserts itself as a rather memorable movie nonetheless. From the beginning, you are thrust into a sick milieu that will, if anything, grab your attention and not let go until the clever ending.While not great by any stretch, Saw is most definitely worth a look for those who enjoy Seven and the like."
2,A Collage of previously seen footage.,"Acting: forget it. Story: Ludacrous. However the production design (sets, the puppet, killer mechanisms) and the cinematography are worth mentioning - although I can tell you now that the stylish overall look of this film will seem awfully dated in a dozen of years.I'm giving this film 2 stars: one for the efforts of the production design team, the other one is to be shared by the marketing heads of the studio, the editor who cut one hell of a good trailer together and the graphic designer(s) who are responsible for the layouts of all promo material."
5,Great plot for a horror film,"This was recommended by my brother due to the fact he knows how I love great horror films. The storyline was very captivating and everything seems to fall into place as the storyline continues. Really not that graphic too, I like scary films but not too much gore..this had just enough to get the point across. Really creepy, I think you will like it..turn off the lights (if you dare-I couldn't), grab the popcorn and settle down for a spine tingling good time."
4,See Saw!,"Ok...that was lame. I apologize. I really liked this movie. I won't repeat all the comments already posted, but this film reminded me of a cross between ""Seven"" and Vincenzo Natali's ""Cube"" (if you haven't seen Cube, I recommend that as well. But avoid the sequel and recent prequel!)The ending is just twisted enough to surprise, but not so out of left field, it leaves you wondering what you missed!"
5,Excellente!,"This is a superb horror film. Spawning multiple sequels, the original is still the best. Horror films are often over looked by award givers in part to the genre in general- most ""award"" films are more drama films.This isn't some European horror trip leaving you confused, and searching for the meaning to the film. And it isn't the squirting blood fest that many ""horror"" films are. This is a well thought out film- relying on plot and acting, rather than CGI or over the top gore.Excellent film- rent it first if you like, but buy it too. Five stars all the way. -If you like Se7en, Hostel, Jaws, or Zodiac, check this film out."
3,BETTER THAN YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE!,"I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch this infamous horror/gore movie. I can pretty much handle anything you can throw at me, but the title suggest I am going to see some really disturbing stuff! To my surprise, the movie has nowhere near the gore I thought it would have. This is a good thing and it is really more in the same vein as Se7en and Halloween etc. A good entry in the horror genre and much better than I expected. I liked the third installment, but I was not too impressed with the second one. If you must see a Saw then this is the Saw to see. ;-b"
1,I laughed out loud,"My husband convinced me to join him at a ""sneak"" preview of Saw this evening. Well I saw it and all I can say is I haven't laughed that hard since I saw Scary Movie. The only problem is I don't think this was supposed to be a comedy! Was it bad? Oh yeah! Is it worth renting? Oh no!"
1,Cut off Your Own Foot Instead...................,I believe this film had promise--at least in the beginning however it quickly descends into a horrific mess with tons of plot holes and a premise that is just shy of absurd. Danny Glover is totally wasted and it's hard to believe he even did this movie. Avoid.
3,Bloody!,We heard about this movie and ordered it to watch on Halloween. Our plans was to pop some popcorn and watch Saw. Forget about eating while watching this show. If you like bloody shows with body parts cut off you will love this movie. Myself I don't care for it.
4,A question,"I just finished watching Saw and thought it was a great movie. maybe I need to watch it a second time, but my question is are we to assume Dr. Gordon was killed by saw and Adam never rescued?"
5,Plenty of thrills and chills!,"I was really surprised by this movie. I waited to see it until part 3 came out. I just had it in my head that it would be stupid, so I never gave it a chance. I'm so glad I listened to my husband! I watched all three movies in one night and I was hooked! The plot is really difficult to explain without giving anything away, so I won't. I'll just tell you if you're into thrillers, horror, or mysteries, watch SAW!"
4,Me Saw...... Me like........,There has been an abundance of reviewers and critics who have said that this movie was bad. I on the other hand thought that Saw had a great plot and a very stunning end. I wouldn't give it a full 5 stars because of the very very end. This movie is very entertaining though and will keep you riveted the entire time.
2,Saw enough,"This movie is about a seriel killer that tries to get his victims to kill themselves or someone else. Unique idea, but the story - although not much of one - doesn't hold up.I won't ruin the ending, but if you ever see it, you'll be a little mad because it ends up making most of the movie nonsensical and preposterous. Instead of making the serial killer into something believable, he ends up being something like a Jason or a Freddie.Based on how this movie ended, you can almost guarantee they'll be a sequel that I'll be sure to miss."
4,Thank God It Isn't PG-13!!!,"First of all, I can't complain enough about all of the PG-13 ""scary"" movies coming out. Even Wes Craven's new flick has been slated PG-13. It almost sickens me. Even if Saw was completely horrible, which it isn't, it would still get points in my book for at least being R. Saw proves to be a great reminder of why scary movies need to be R.Saw is an uncomfortable psychological thriller that follows in the footsteps of David Fincher. Think of the savagery and bloodiness of Seven with the atmosphere and puzzlement of The Game. Saw is extremely well-paced, has some great visiual (often disturbing) imagery, and has an awesome ending you won't see coming for a thousand miles. And I can't stress the fact that it is rated R enough. What more do you want?"
2,"Looked good in the previews, anyway...","I went to go see SAW with high expectations and thought I'd leave the theatre with chills!!..That's not the case. Although it gets off to a good start and does have its creepy moments (such as the elaboration on the situations of the Jigsaw Killer's victims)and the moment where the saws are discovered... But what ultimately killed this movie for me was the horrible acting displayed by the actor playing the doctor (one of the victims trapped). That and the fact that (***SPOILER***) there were two instances where the kidnapper could've easily been killed...those two scenes I found utterly ridiculous because the victims allowed the killer to live.Just don't set your expectations high for this kind of film. The acting's cringe-wrothy, as is the car-chasing scene with Danny Glover and the Jigsaw Killer's apprentice.."
5,SAW IT TO THE LAST INSTALLMENT,"I didn't hear anything about the Saw Series, until the 1st installment was released on DVD. I rented it, loved it so much that I bought it and never looked back. I went to the theatre to see the later releases each year.Saw I is a different twist to the horror genre. The killer isn't actually the killer."
1,Simply awful,"I rented this one to see if it was actually as bad as the premise would suggest. It was. Not only did I feel sick while watching this movie, I felt nauseous for the rest of the day.I'm not talking about a squeamish kind of nausea; my stomach is a strong as they come. I felt disgusted with myself for actually having watched and sat through this dog.Sadly, there was a time in my teens when I would have absolutely loved this flick.PS-- I also felt cheated by the image of a rotary saw blade on the dvd, when all they used were cheap hacksaws... big difference."
1,Saw,"Sorry but Despite it's Drama and it's So-called Horror, I don't mind gore when necessary in a Horror movie to get it's point across. but The Saw Series which By the way I have only seen up to 3 I think. Is plain torture porn, I don't like torture to such extremes, It's all it is,that and Hostel . there is no value in such a movie. And then the guy come on? oh well. maybe my bias would make others think I am crazy for not liking the movie, but I apologize it's not my type of movie, watch/rent it and see if you like it."
1,Not even close....,"A pointless plot, bad acting and the typical Hollywood formula for teeny-bopper horror movies. The ending made the movie go from crap to MAJOR crap. This movie is very scary and disturbing - for 3rd graders....You want disturbing? You want to be freaked out for weeks after a movie? Try out some of the best, most disturbing work anywhere - look up director Takashi Miike on Amazon, then try out Audition, Gozu, Ichi, etc.But for all those who thought SAW was scary and disturbing, then forget it - you couldn't handle Miike. Try Sesame Street."
1,bad movie/bad ending,"I saw this movie with a friend of mine the other night and I have to admit I was really looking forward to it. I was told that it was a bit gory but it had a good plot and the ending was good as well. WRONG!!!This movie had poor acting as well as a very dark plot. There is nothing happy or satisfying in this movie. In the end, you feel very cheated and wish you had the last 100 minutes of your life back. If you are looking for a good thriller, do not see saw!"
1,SOOO Stupid!,"This movie works for about 45 minutes, then takes a horrible nose dive with some truly ridiculous plot twists. AND I was SO happy when Danny Glover got massacred in this movie. I actually stood up and clapped. Any detective who has his gun on the killer and doesn't get him, then loses him AGAIN after obsessing over the crime to the point of insanity, deserves to die. This movie was really dumb. Bad writing, bad acting (now we know where has-been actors like Cary Eiwes go to die). What a waste."
2,Worst hyped film ever,"Ever rented a scary movie, expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear, and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot? This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. I feel like Saw tried to follow Se7en's incredibly fascinating psychological theme, but failed miserably in doing so. I was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer. The beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller; believe me, it is far from that.I didn't understand, or care, why any of the characters were acting the way they did; or what was going to happen to them. What was Adam's lesson that he was supposed to learn? Yes, the doctor needed to be there, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I just missed something."
4,Thought Provoking,"Tessa Crigger's book, I Hear Gaea's Tears, is an extension of her own love for nature. Every word conveys her passionate message. The Earth isn't filled with unlimited resources. This book really made me consider my role on this planet as well as the habits that I can change. A thought provoking and enjoyable read. ~Amey Tippett, author of Alison's Journey"
4,Un excelente Libro,"Uno de los mejores libros de la Historia medieval que he leido, algo viejo pero con nueva reimpresion; Este libro esta muy bien documentado y narra amenamente todas las implicaciones que estuvieron vigentes para esa epoca."
5,Old Dogs,I have the rest of the series. I enjoyed receiving this one too. I was afraid I would never get to read it.
3,Nice but not a pocket flask,"The glass bottle and cap are nice, exactly like an EZ bottle or Grolsh bottle which is convienent because it will make it easy to replace the rubber washer once it wears down. I do like it and I'll take it out when going to a friend's house or keep it at my home desk but.... This thing is huge. I'm giving it 3-stars for calling it a pocket flask when it's just not true."
5,Great Quality,This is exactly as i had hoped it would be :)I've filled mine with m&m;'s with my daughters face on them(its a present for dad before he goes over seas :)Very good :)
3,Good,"This product is good. We used it to make different drinks, but we found that the top leaked a little bit when we put it in the freezer. Other than that, its a really good product. Was larger that I thought it would be and the whole thing is kind of curved, one side kind of caves in and the other bows out. The glass is thick, which is good because I didn't want to drop it and have it break.The product arrived quickly and was packaged so they didn't break. Its a good product for what you pay for. I just wish they didn't leak. The bottle got all sticky."
5,Indeed a Sweet Agony!,Hard to believe that a book that truly makes you feel the pain of its protagonists can be so sweet. The structure is nothing short of brilliant with the constant juxtaposing of a chapter where you meet and get to know the participants of Sean's Thanksgiving gathering with one prophesizing their(sometimes)sorrowful fates. A real tour de force that hopefully will be read by many.
2,Skin Care Set,"I only use one tool in this whole kit and I spent over $32.00 on it. This was not a great buy, sorry seller."
2,spoon extractor,These products are not helpful in removing whiteheads or pimples. The spoon extractor hole are too small and the tip is not very sharp. The loop extractor works but require hard presses which hurt the skin. I would not purchase this again!
3,Gestapo,"Good and wish it was longer, and did cover the issues, and could of spent more time showing certain topics."
4,"Good Product, Horrible Packaging","Pros: good sturdy construction, relatively easy to assemble (2 people/2hours)Cons: confusing assembly instructions (make sure you have all the tools necessary for assembly), poor packaging, all hardware was loose inside the box, box was ripped and the back of the table was scratched and scraped in quite a few places.The shipping company CEVA, that delivers these tables regularly, said that our table was not in the worst shape that they have seen. Also, delivery is only to the door. Do not expect further assistance without some sort of payment."
3,Good table,"It is a pretty good table and it is easy to fold up and down. The wheels could be a whole lot easier to turn, though, which makes it difficult to roll."
4,"Great table, but set up/instruction manual is insanely complicated","The table is great quality and it's really easy to fold up and store. However, assembly was very complicated and the instruction manual is not that great. Expect to spend a few hours re-reading the instruction manual."
4,Great table,"This really is a great table. I would've given it 5 out 5, but they forgot to include the caster wheels in the package and I had to wait to get replacements."
4,great for beginners! little difficult to put together,"This is a great product for beginners in an affordable prize, the only down side is that it is not easy to roll away after your game."
2,Expensive item arrived damaged,The table arrive in a damage box and I contacted Amazom after putting the table together found it was damaged and I will not be able to balance the table. I got no response from Amazon. This table was quite costly.
4,"good product, not toally easy assmbling","The table is good for our recreational use. The delivery was smooth. We even had the delivery guy carry it into our basement and we paid some tips.Given I am not a handy man, the assembling was not totally easy. But I guess for such a big piece, it would just need some time."
4,good table,pretty good table. the steel frame is not as sturdy as i wanted but for the price range it's great. (if you want tournament quality you have to pay at least 800). but provided that I'm not going to move this table around too much in the basement the frame really isn't an issue for me. the wood top has a nice feel and the bounce is great. can't complain. -1 star for the net design. the net that comes with it is a little cheap. and the net support is attached to the table assembly so even if I want to replace the net with a better set it may get in the way.assembly time is just over 2 hours for me with 2 persons working on it so it's really not bad at all.
5,Excellent Buy,This is the first time I have ever ordered from amazon and it will not be the last. The book was in great condition. Very few marks and definitely not what I expected for the price.!!! I would definitely recommend purchasing books from amazon.
1,Wrong hand side delivered,"I purchased a right handed flap for a right handed holster, and received a left handed flap... What kind of review do you expect?"
3,"Good intro, but too much apologetic to be scholarly","This book is an excellent introduction to marriage and family within the worlds of Greek, Roman, and Middle Eastern paganism as well as those of the Old Testament and Second Temple Judaism. The contributors consistently get right to it and do a good job of covering all the facts and some of the implications and applications, recommending many more resources for further reading along the way. I learned a lot while reading this book. The only complaints I have pertain to the final chapter of the book. The section on the New Testament departs from the scholarship found in the rest of the book and seems instead to delve into evangelical apologetics, even including the mandatory swipes at Roman Catholicism. A real New Testament scholar doing real New Testament scholarship would have been a much better choice. I think it also would have been helpful to include an additional chapter focusing on early Christian attitudes toward marriage and the family."
1,Stuck with a map of 2006,"Why would anyone buy this thing for today? The maps are out of date and even worse, YOU CAN NOT UPDATE THE MAPS. There are no updates given by LG!??!! Why would anyone buy this thing? I bought mine in 2007 and it worked great but after a few years, I noticed it wasn't showing any new streets or highways. Don't buy it."
2,It's a piece of,This thing blew up on me just a couple of months past its warranty period. I'm not happy.
3,"Fine Stories, Poor Presentation","This volume of the ADVENTURES OF BATMAN AND ROBIN series exemplifies the creativity we have seen in Warner Bros. animation during the end of the twentieth century. ""Heart of Ice"" explores the urban legend of Walt Disney's interest in cryogenics and produces a media magnate so obsessed with immortality that he enlist Mr. Freeze's help. ""Fire from Olympus,"" featuring Maxie Zeus (a deranged criminal who believes he is the ancient god) depicts Batman's Rogues Gallery as other members of the ancient pantheon. These programs bear repeated viewing, because they have rich concepts executed well.That said, this tape offers a poor value, because it is not record in SP mode. You will get fuzzy sound and picture. This series deserves better packaging."
2,Pump is a bust!,Although the pump worked on my ball but it kept losing air. The pump was not as easy to use as a regular basketball pump and I returned the ball because it was deflating due to an air leak at the pump. Better to get a regular ball for almost half the price.
2,Pump issues,"i don't really write reviews, but i felt like i needed to say something about this one. maybe its me, but i couldn't get the pump to work. So i bought a new basketball. I bought a regular one, and bought a pump. I wish that infusion thing worked out, because it would have been great to deflate it, put it in my bag, and then pump it up again at the court. But my friend warned me they don't work so good. I'm just stubborn i guess. That's my 2 cents. Take it for what its worth."
2,"""Dual Pump Action"" is mostly an annoyance","Got this ball about six months ago without even realizing it featured the built-in ""pump."" It's a decent ball overall, but after several months of use (3-4 hours a week) the ""pump"" button kind of wears loose. When the ball bounces on the exact spot where the pump button is it deadens and throws off the trajectory of the bounce. I also suspect that every time this happens some air is released, because I keep having to re-inflate the thing with a real pump every couple days. I've had it with this ball; getting a new one this weekend. Just get a regular ball."
5,Big Old Red Truck now has awesome bed protection,"Put the liner on the rim of the bed of my 1997 CTD 2500 RAM. I have a bedliner installed, so this protects the edges as well.Great stuff. Goes on easy."
5,Reigns in Tummy Pooch,"I'm very satisfied with this. I got it because I wanted something that would pull in and conceal my ""spare tire"" and this does it wonderfully.For added convenience, the crotch opens up so you don't have to take the entire thing off, when you need to use the bathroom."
3,alright..,"This does hold well, but it rolls down a tiny bit in the back for me, which is a) uncomfortable and b) ugly as it digs into my back. It also digs into my inner thighs so I wish it were a little longer, but I kind of expected that and it's not really noticeable unless you're wearing something which is tight against the inside of your thigh(not bad under jeans). It's pretty uncomfortable. The boning digs into my ribs when I sit down, but it's kind of worth it considering how well this thing controls my tummy and hips.I mostly bought this to keep my post-two children tummy in line, and it does that well. I will use it, but I might try pinning the back to my bra."
5,Works well and surprisingly comfortable,"I am about 20 lbs overweight, most of this in my midsection. I found that this shaper held my belly in quite well. I definitely looked several inches smaller at my waist. It was extremely easy to put on, and comfortable to wear. It did not make any unpleasant bulges where it ends on my thighs or back. The open crotch is not really usable or beneficial, but it isn't uncomfortable either."
3,Not bad but not great,"The reason I bought this shaper was because I needed a pair of black shorts for a costume that would also slim my thighs. When I tried them on I thought the shorts weren't bad though the rough fabric wasn't the best. However, what got me upset was the trap door, which I suppose is if you needed to use the restroom. It wouldn't really function properly for that aspect and the idea made me feel disgusted. I couldn't use them for shorts after that."
5,Just as advertised (except for the woman part),This girdle has quickly become one of my favorites. It provides excellent tummy and thigh control. I can wear it all day and not be uncomfortable. The only thing I would change would be to add some lace and satin panels to make it a little sexier.
3,"effective, unless you want to sit down","Overall, this shaper is fine for special occasions-- it keeps everything in place very effectively and creates a smooth line down the body (i.e., no bumps and lumps around the belly or where the thigh meets the hip or any of that). However, I wouldn't wear this for work or any other daily activity because the wires bend a weird way when I sit down and create this perfect, half circle bulge of bent wire that looks truly bizarre. Think about how wire naturally bends-- now picture that going down your abdomen. I wore it for my bridal shower and was really surprised by how it looked in pictures where I was sitting down. It looked like I was wearing an inner tube. I decided to pass on it for my actual wedding day-- my natural belly looks far less ridiculous.Also, the pee flap is a useless feature. I would really like to meet someone who could make it work; I never even tried because I have a low tolerance for humiliation."
4,pretty good shapewear,"holds you in pretty well, not as firm a support as i was expecting. Will give you a muffin top if you have any extra weight."
5,Firm Control,"The Shaper works great! It makes me bulge at the top of it guessing as I pulled it up it pushed my fatty parts to the top (LOL) but its expected, but my dresses look real nice and it smooths me out."
4,slimmer you,This was sized smaller than I expected and I was not able to use it. You should probably order a size larger than you think you need.
2,Meh... not impressed,"Created a weird crease on the thigh because it is too tight, doesn't provide much tummy support. Does smooth the buns and love handles though."
1,NO INSTRUCTIONS provided - BEGINNERS BEWARE,"If you're a beginner in watch repairs, THIS KIT IS NOT FOR YOU.After 2 months of contacting Watch Pavillion, finally I received an email stating ""it's self explanatory"" - NOT FOR A NOVICE who may need instructions so they don't ruin their watches.BEGINNERS BEWARE - YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN."
1,RUSTY TOOLS...NO INSTRUCTIONS,I received this tool set from my daughter for Christmas. Several of the tools were rusted and the set come with no instructions. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
1,Deluxe Leather Watch Repair Tool Kit,"It is over price by 5 times, the kits is ok but pay too much if buy it from shops. It is not completed kits.Once you get it, you also need to get few more to satisfy.I feel unsatisfy once I have it, I still look for different tools to repair and adjust my watch. 35 dollars for only 50% of need and overprice 5 times from shop."
3,Not for the inexperienced!,"There were no instructions with this item, so I emailed the company and they sent them in PDF format. However, they weren't clear at all, and I ended up having to send it back, paying a 20% restocking fee as well as $9.75 in return postage. Make sure you know how to use the tools before purchase."
4,Resizing a watch band,"The tool works well.After spending 45 minutes without the tool, 15 minutes with the tool took care of resizing the watchband for my son."
2,not that good,this is a much older version of the game than i thought it would be...the questions are all from the late 90s...and the categories jump around randomly without you touching anything...i would return the item but the return policy of no shipping fees refunded and having to pay for shipping the item back makes it too much trouble for an item that was purchased used...
4,Fun Fun Fun,"This is a fantastic game and I have yet to find a person who doesn't like it. It's easy to use for the most part. The only ""catch"" is that a lot of people don't understand how the buttons work. When you play, tell everyone that you must push the START button to begin a round. Pushing NEXT doesn't start the game. Sounds silly but people mess it up all the time. I like that it doesn't involve cards that you have to shuffle or clean up, it doesn't have a max on how many people can play so everyone can enjoy, and you can play it anywhere...you don't need a table, just some hands and creativity!"
5,Girls Night,"When the girl's in my family have a ""Girl's Night Off"" (no kids/husbands/boyfriends) we love to play Catch Phrase! We pop a bottle of wine or champagne, make some snacks and laugh until we cry. Our ages range from 20 years to 50 something and we all equally enjoy it.The only problem is that after the 4th or 5th time we played it, it started repeating itself.Hasbro needs to come up with a way to add new words / catagories so we can continue to have a terrific time at these game nights.Please come up with a fix to this problem ASAP!!!!"
5,Electronic Catchphrase Review,Great price for a great product. Shipped in time to receive for Christmas without paying for expedited shipping.
3,Lots of FUN! till your fifth time playing it...,This will be the best game you've ever played till about the 5th time you play it. Then you realize that you know all the answers. There should be some sort of download where you can update the questions so that the game never gets old and repetative. Good for the price and good for a present. But dont expect to play this every weekend.
5,This one will make you shout,"Even if you are usually a shy, retiring sort of game player, Catch Phrase will have you shouting with everyone else. The timer gets your pulse racing as you try to get your partner(s) to guess words based on your clues. My family loved it so much that I've bought gifts for every game loving person I know. The only downside is it is so much fun that you will use all the cards up in no time. Parker Brothers, if you are reading this, we need card refills with new words."
4,needs volume control and logical scoring,"Let me preface: very fun and portable game. Bad points: The oh so annoying beeping sound is intolerable. I put duct tape all over the speaker with little effect. It would be fine if you could turn the volume down, if the sound weren't so shrill, or if you could switch it to a small flashing light (another 20 cents in parts?) or have a counter in an area of the readout screen. It could then be a travel game or possibly hearing impaired accessible.Another minor point is the scoring is not 'fair'. It is scored by 'hot potato' method instead of by number answered in the alotted time. For example (only 2 teams allowed and you pass to the other team each phrase) Team 1 can burn 99% of the shared time on their phrase and then hand it off to Team 2 before they even really get a chance.Otherwise, it is a fun interactive game."
2,Don't drop it!,"Well, if you're anything like my friends, who are used to playing the original version, you've gotten kind of used to tossing the unit just in time for the buzzer to run out. Playing this game makes everybody a bit competitive, so people do get out of hand. With the old version the discus would just break open and you'd have to reload it, not a big deal. But the second time we played with the 'new and improved' electronic version it was dropped on the hardwood floor and cracked open. So much for durability. I think I'll be sticking to my older version, thank you very much!"
3,Great game BUT..,This game was a lot of fun but we started getting repeats much quicker than I liked based on the cost of it. Hasbro should either increase the word list or provide for downloads. Not a game you can play regularly without someone accusing you of cheating!
3,CATCH PHRASE,This is NOT the item I ordered - the overview said 11 categories - this one has 7. Paid a lot of money for basically what I already had..............Too much hassle to return .... which is probably what the seller figures!False advertisement!
5,GREAT FUN,WE USED IT AFETR A DINNER PARTY AND EVERYONE REALLY GOT INTO. IT WAS GREAT FUN AND KEPT US ENTERTAINED FOR ALMOST TWO HOURS.
3,"fun fun game, but not happy with repeats!","I absolutely love this game, it is really fun to play with friends and family. This is the first time of owning the game and of playing this specific version.I just got this for Christmas and that morning I played two rounds with my brother. Later in the day, i played a real game with two teams. Lo and behold, there were so many repeats! My brother and I were getting really annoyed, because the SECOND time of playing it we got at least 10 repeats. The third time we all played we got at least another 10 more.I'm disappointed in this because if there is 10,000 words to choose from why did we get so many repeats in just one day? I am thinking of writing the company, because that isn't right.Since this is such a fun game to play, I know i'll be playing it a lot, and that will get old really fast if I keep getting repeats."
5,We had great fun with this!,"I gave this to one sister for Christmas and another sister gave it to her children for Christmas. So I played it twice in a couple of days. We love games and we loved this! It's incredibly fast-paced and so much fun. We laughed for hours while playing and then talking about what happened when we played it. My sister advises that you set up a videocamera so you can laugh at everyone's frantic cluegiving later! P.S. Get the electronic version, the paper version is too hard to read for over-40 eyes."
2,Not enough catch phrases!,"Compared to the original (non-electronic) game, this is a ripoff. We brought the game to a ski trip weekend. After a few hours of playing on the first night, we realized we'd ""beat"" the game, because we kept getting all the same phrases from the machine. I was so disappointed. Compared to the original version, there just aren't very many options. I feel like an electronic version should last just about forever."
2,Very disappointed!,"The first version of this game is one of my very favorites. I thought I was upgrading by buying the electronic version. Boy, was I mistaken. Four of us playing in one evening - less than two hours - went through ALL the words and phrases. What do we do now?"
4,Catch Phrase Is A Great Party Game,I first became acquainted with this game at a neighborhood party. I purchased one for the family to play at our weekly get-togethers. It has become a staple.
5,I love catch phrase,This game is so much fun. My family can play for hours. I dont get how this seller in particular gets away with a price of 90 something dollars. But it is definitly worth a reasonable price say 20-25 dollars.
3,Not enough clues and not challenging,"While this game was fun, it wasn't nearly challenging enough. The clues were simple to act and speak out. There aren't enough clues per category either. We were out of clues after playing for about 30 minutes for some categories. I bought this game from Target on sale for $23 and it was definitely NOT worth it! I'm just glad that I didn't pay the $40 plus dollars that it normally cost. I thought there had to be some mistake, but sure enough, we were out of clues and the clues that we did have for other categories were repetitive. For example, the word ""anti"" kept popping up over and over. ""anti-virus, anitseptic, antibiotic, antidote"". There were many other clues that were similar. Maybe the board game is better, but we didn't find this challenging enough."
5,Catch Phrase - Entertaining & Educational,"Purchased Catch Phrase II after playing with friends. It's easy to learn, fun to use and few or many can play. The game moves quickly and is engaging to all participants. I'd strongly recommend for ages 8 to 80 as an educational, fun game when a group of 4 or more gets together."
5,"Fun, Fun Game",Our family loves this game. Sometimes after supper we will play a few rounds. It's great for a lot of laughs. We've played it at parties as well and it is a big hit with the guests.
1,Why is this $109???,this is listed on the Hasboro website at a suggested retail price of $24.99. But it is super fun! Just buy it somewhere else.
