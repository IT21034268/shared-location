3,Pipsqueaks Donkey,This is a toy definitely made for a small dog who isn't a voracious chewer. We love the cute little sound it makes...like a donkey hee-haw but our dog ate off the tail in a day. Sad..it's such a cute toy.
1,Drives humans crazy too,"I somehow missed the description line that says this toy will ""drive dogs crazy."" Thankfully the noisemaker stuffed inside was removable. Overall the toy is really small. I mean, really really small. Destroyed by my dog within a day."
3,Sturdy - Not so bad,"The black material forming the mane and tail came off in chunks immediately when the dog just picked up the toy. The sound effect worked for two days. I have a 6 pound dog who just shook the toy a few times, kept getting mouthful of black and I had to keep picking the black stuff out of his mouth and off the carpet. Not worth the hassle.UPDATE: after 5 months toy no longer sheds, is still intact. Noise-maker still works but not with gentle play. It makes its braying sounds if it is dropped, hits something or if I run over it in my wheelchair which has happened frequently. Toy still working."
5,Cool toy,"My little mutt loves this toy. I have accidentally thrown it in the wash several times with the voice box still in it and it still works. The only thing I don't like about it is that you can take the voice box out which (because of the opening) makes it easier for a dog to take it out to. Of course, it is your typical made in China type toy that starts falling apart at the seams etc. but this is typical of every toy I have ever purchased. We have had this toy for about 4 months and his tail hair has fallen off and I have had to perform surgery on his arm to repair a stuffing leak. Overall, it's a cute toy and my dog loves the unique noises that he makes plus he loves it's small size."
2,when arrived was broken,"when it came in the mail, did not work at all. no sound. My little dog was able to almost shred it. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,SUPER SMALL - smaller than small!,"I wish I would have seen the photo of ""actual size"" in the persons hand before ordering this. It is about the size of a mouse, so double check your idea of ""small dog"" before ordering. It is going back. I am going to have to keep a ruler handy when ordering from now on."
4,Not as good as they used to be...,"I have been buying these ""talking"" dog toys for about 4 years for my toy poodle. They make their noise when shaken or tossed. We have an elephant, a duck, an octopus, gorilla, monkey and a horse. They do wear out, and the donkey was ""loosing his voice"". So I bought another....this one didn't make any noise. It was replaced, and the latest hee-haws, but not as loudly as the first one did when new and I suspect won't last as long."
5,Pip Squeaks Donkey,Before I even got the tags off my lil male Chi was jumping up and down. He loves that it makes sounds and plays with it all the time. It is a very well made toy that is being put through being chewed and slung around.
4,Great multi-racial family history,"I read this book as a book club selection a few years ago. I had doubts about it -- but after I read it--I loved it. Ms. Yelena Khanga is a Black Russian women who discovers her heritage and her love of jounalism. Khanga has such a rich family history, American (Black and white), Russian and African. As she tells her story she is unashame and relentless in detailing the facts - good and bad. Her family leaves New York in the early 1900's and lives in Russia. As the story unfolds, the family has been involved in Russian and African politics, her grandparents and father-- which is an inexpected twist. She is a very strong woman who comes to American as a journalist and rediscovers the life her family left behind. This story is unusual and unpredictable. After reading the book, I felt absorbed in family history-- not only American history, but Russian and African history.If you are a fan of family history as I am - you will like this book."
5,An ever prevalent look at a celebrity obsessed culture.,A fantastic look at ourselves in regard to our hunger for a celebrity news diet. So much fun to watch. Great mix of sincerity and Comedy.
5,More than a David and Goliath story,"Greg Kinnear gives a superior performance as Bob Kearns, an electrical engineering professor who fights Ford Motors for stealing his patented invention, the intermittent windshield wiper. This good family man with a sense of right and wrong wants justice at any cost. His family and their story will rip your heart out.It's more than a David and Goliath story and this ""sleeper"" of a movie will get you talking afterward!"
5,Flash of Genius DVD,I ordered the movie for a project at school so I needed it right away. I received this movie very quickly. I was extremely pleased with the time it took to receive it as well as the shape of the movie. Looked and played like brand new. Definitely would purchase from this user again!
4,I really like based on True Stories,"I cannot say that the movie was non stop action, and there were times it seemed to ""slog down"" a little, but it was an incredibly interesting true story of the man-an inventor-who, for the sake of inventors everywhere, who envision a simpler, better way of doing things---took on corporate America, and actually won! Incredible personal sacrifice, but won.Most inventors, and those who really change life, fall victims to the ""Second Mouse Syndrome"".....that is, it is the SECOND mouse, not the first, who gets the cheese.This man refused to let that happen. I found the story to be tremendously inspiring, and Gregg Kinnear delivers an excellent and totally believable performance.This movie is a rare gem.....seek it out."
4,would have been WAY better without Lauren Graham,"This movie makes you think. It's quite good and raises some interesting questions. Greg Kinnear is actually perfect in the role. Casting someone other than Lauren Graham (not really that talented, highly overrated) as the wife would have been a wise move. Other than that, this movie was surprisingly good. There's something for everyone. Guys will love that it has to do with engines, motors, etc. and chicks will dig the emotional upheavals and relationship issues that are part of the movie."
3,Just OK,"While its nobody's fault, this story starts with 2 strikes against it. First, (I presume) everybody knows the outcome. Second, the invention, while handy as a screwdriver, just doesn't seem worth getting all excited about. Perhaps in Seattle. There are much richer films about the little guy like Mr. Smith Goes To Washington and in non-fiction, the one with Russel Crowe vs. the tobacco companies. That's not to say Flash is bad; its just not very exciting and it takes as long as the actual case did.What would make a more interesting, true story? How about that of Major Armstrong, who invented FM radio and was driven to suicide while trying to collect royalties from RCA. His widow ultimately prevailed when case was settled, about 40 years later. And what about Tom Scholz vs. his record company? I'm sure there are others."
2,Ho Hum. I truly wanted to like this movie about Bob Crane.,"Greg Kinnear is a talented actor but even he cannot save this movie from mundane. I first became interested in this movie when I read an obituary about Bob Crane. What an interesting character. He was an inventor that claimed he was wronged by the big 3 automakers and lost his marriage, job and nearly went mad trying to prove it.I thought this movie could put flesh and bones on the page turning article I had read in the New York Times. Sadly it didn't. It disappointed just as John Grisham movies disappoint if you've read the book first. It doesn't seem to be true to the real Bob Crane who was a cantankerous man fixated on a revolutionary invention and how it should be manufactured. Greg Kinnear was just way too likable in this movie.It is slow, long, boring and I just plain didn't care at the end. I do appreciate that they took a stab at trying to tell the story but the ho hum factor just can't grab another star from me."
3,thought provoking and a great performance by Kinnear.....lousy DVD,Okay...lousy may be a bit much...but goodness if any DVD screamed out for a bonus feature about the real story and real man this is it! Heck...Amazon.com have some interviews but NOT on the DVD? One of the reasons to buy DVDs is to get something extra and when the subject is based on a true story we have real opportunity. Okay enough griping...its an engrossing movie and Kinnear is terrific...as he always is.
4,Great Movie,"Flash of Genius was such a great movie! It's a David and Goliath type story based on truth. Unfortunately, it didn't do as well at the box office because of it's lack of action, violence, etc., but that's exactly why I enjoyed it so much. The transaction was great as well."
5,great,"great movie give all stars,i order a lot of things from amzon and never had a problem,i wil keep buying from amzon"
5,FORD Caused An Evil Real World!!!,"The movie FLASH OF GENIUS is a very REAL MOVIE (THE EVENTS DID REALLY HAPPEN), and is also a very sad movie on many counts. The HERO got royal screwed over by FORD (THE LYING BASTARDS), and lost his wife in the aftermath of going after FORD (THE LYING BAD GUYS THAT SCREWED HIM OVER)!!! The bottomline is that justice finally prevailed, but the FORD BAD GUYS RUINED THIS MAN'S LIFE!!!!!!!!!!! I hope that the real people involved in causing harm to this man and his family are where they belong burning in HELL!!!!!!! This is a reality check of the first degree!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,FLASH OF INSANITY!,"Whenever I'm watching a based on a true story movie, I always wonder just how much of it is true. Flash of Genius is a well told story of the inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper. The film takes us from the first thoughts of this invention or ""flash of genius"" through the deal with the Ford for use in their cars and then through the long court battle with Ford after they screwed him over. What happens along the way is both inspiring, but very sad too. Kinnear does a fine job as this inventor and the story purposely focuses on his determination to right the wrong that these unethical scums have bestowed upon him.This is a very good film and it engrossing to watch and when it's all said and done, you may ask yourself was it worth it? Money is a nice thing to have, but family is irreplaceable. You'll have to decide for yourself. This film is well worth seeing and Kinnear shows he is more than just a pretty face."
4,Real Life Drama,A true story of one man's fight against the automobile establishment. With Greg Kinnear playing the lead role you can really see that it is possible to achieve your rights; the entire family benefits from just the determination of one man.
3,good movie,The movie was slow to begin with but it sped up about a half way into it. Spoiler alert - I'm glad he finally won in the end.
1,Not worth the money,"This was inexpensive and you get what you pay for. The bristles were falling out before I removed it from the box. It is very flimsy. The shipping box was a large rectangular box and the broom barely fit, so they stuffed it in and ""made"" it fit, rather than getting a more appropriate sized box. As a result the bristles are permanently bent as is the ""foot stand"". My son doesn't like it and he loves everything Harry Potter. Plasticius junkus!!"
5,Perfect,"This item worked perfect, and was easy to program, it includes exact instructions to program it, and only takes like 5 seconds to do it. Dealers will charge you around $50 to do that."
3,Good book painfully marred by errors,"This text contains many important writings on planning theory. However, the book contains so many errors that it becomes tedious to read and, in some cases, the meaning of the original writing is obscured completely. There is a piece written by John Forester that has a section from one paragraph mistakenly placed within another paragraph, causing that particular portion of Forester's work to make no sense. My recommendation would be to wait for a revised edition. I think it is shameful to publish a text with so many errors--especially when the text is often used in graduate-level courses, where students are often criticized for their own writing errors."
4,Third in the Dragon Knight series,"While it's not quite as awesome as the Dragon Knight or the Dragon and the George, the third novel in the series carries an interesting plot centering around Sir Giles and the Hallow Men. Dickson draws on the mystical creations of old authors and weaves them into his own world. Few books make fantasy believable. All those in the Dragon Knight series make it real."
4,The dragon who doesn't stop,"Yet another great performance by the dragon knight. It has all the enjoyable elements of the previous book that I loved. My dissapointment with this book is that to me the final threat seems all to easy to take care of in the end. I am deffinatly not trying to say this book is any less than the rest but the dark powers could have found some thing better than the hollow men. On the bright sde more than just the hollow men are there and it makes the book that much more enjoyable. Jim, Brian and Giles provide another exciting battle against the dark powers that you will love. Keep reading these books, they get even better than this."
4,The Dragon on the Border,"The third book in Mister Dickson's series was quite good, but I dont think it was as good as the first two. First, I don't think the antagonists were quite evil enough, they were just personalityless ghosts who raided various people who lived on the border. One of my favorite parts of the Dragon Knight was that the sorceror had a distinct personality and did some distincly evil things. Second, Giles was hardly in the book! I mean he's the reason James is there in the first place! And finally, James didn't even turn himself into a dragon very much! I mean the title of the book is: The DRAGON on the Border! But despite this few quirks, I still think this was a very good book and worthy of the Dragon Knight Series."
1,Not entirely terrible,"This book makes me sad - it could actually have been any good, if Basu had had a good editor. There are some promising ideas and some promising writing. There is, however, a whole lot of trite cliches and blantant copying of other authors ideas. Those last are among the most cringeworthy aspects of the book: they appear without rhyme or reasons as standalone paragraphs, don't fit into the universe and make one doubt the judgement of the writer.Stay away, I wish I had."
1,"Derivative, amateurish hodgepodge","This is the kind of tripe that results when fans who have read too much and written too little arrogantly think they can write as well as their favourite authors. A dreadful mishmash of every cliche, stereotype and tired recycling of fantasy elements. Even the way they're put together is unoriginal and unimaginative.It's no wonder this very pathetic attempt isn't available anywhere outside of India. The author would do well to go back to reading instead of churning out more fan fiction to cash in on the current craze for this bestselling genre. It's even shocking that an Indian writer would produce such rubbish at a time when Indian writers are doing their country proud through their writing.Basu sucks."
2,Ouch,Leaves red marks on face-but does get rid of hair on upper lip and chin area. If use do before bed.
1,"Horrible, DO NOT BUY this product unless you like pain!","This product is horrible - I tried it, bought it from HBA Products, and am waiting for them to respond to my request for a refund, reason being it burned the top part of my lip, and did not remove the hair! It feels like fiberglass running across your skin, and I didn't even have hardly any hair to remove! Now I'm left with swollen, irritated skin, which will take forever to calm down, that's tender to the touch! And I've waisted hard earned money.Ladies, listen to me, I implore you: DO NOT RISK TRYING THIS PRODUCT!!!!! It may work for a few people, but there are others out there who got burned like I did. It's not worth it, I may have to even go to the doctor now because of this ridiculous cheap imitation."
4,Hair off facial buffer,"I have used the Hair Off facial buffer for several years. It can cause some redness, but I had to make sure that I wasn't using much pressure. I no longer get the redness, and I am very satisfied with the product."
4,SHAMAN,NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST OF THE SERIES BUT STILL A GOOD READ...TAKES YOU INTO THE WORLD AT THAT TIME...AND FOLLOWS THE COLE FAMILY HISTORY ;IN ANOTHER TIME AND PLACE
4,Shaman,"Great book, well worth reading. While not quite as good as The Physician, this book jumps to the mid 1800s and tells an enthralling tale of the Cole family. Well researched and a joy to read."
5,"Excellent Book, Excellent Author",I have a very difficult time finding a real good author. Noah Gordon is an excellent story teller. This is the third book I have read of his. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
4,Well documented,Wonderful way to learn about life in another time. I'm happy I read it. I'm ready for the next one in the trilogy
3,late book,"i guess its because of the storm that hit, this book came very late. It did get here but really thought it should have arrived sooner. The book came wrapped well and the book looked good."
3,not as good as the physician,slow moving....was not as interesting as the physician...still was good reading and i look foward to the third in the series
3,"The Civil War Again, Sigh...","I was blown away by Gordon's ""Physician"", a good five stars. The sequal ""Shaman"" proved disppointing to me for two reasons. First, because of the extensive Civil War content---once more we fight the battle of Gettysburg! Admittedly this may be a personal reaction because I've spent 20 years teaching U.S. history to undergraduates and am quite familiar with the period the book encompasses. ""Physician"" was far more exotic and fascinating because I know much less about the time period (centuries earlier) in which it was set.The second reason, however, was that Gordon divided his forces in ""Shaman"", having two heroes---the father and the son. In Physician, his main character was Rob J. Cole, who didn't have to share the limelight with a father, and emerged as a stronger and more unforgettable hero."
4,Docbob,Good Read but not as great as The Physician. Character development good. Story Line holds your interest thrughout. Enjoyed learning some of the hisyory it contains
3,Page turner,"This book, the last of the trilogy, is a real page turner as were the others. I was not disappointed in any way."
5,Beth,This is a book to learn about early medicine I suggest this book if you are open-minded as to how the life style learning and how you can become anything you want with desire.a
4,Interesting and Enjoyable Book,"This is a very readable novel about 2 physicians, father and son, who studied medicine in the US in the early/middle parts of the 19th century, and were both involved in the Civil War. The story is very interesting and well-written, and the picture of the time is fascinating."
3,Just OK,Not sure why exactly but Shaman just didn't grab me in nearly the same way as The Physician. It's a fair read but I won't retread it as I have the more famous Cole story over the years.
5,Shamon (Cole),I found this book to be extremely interesting. It held me from start to finish. The detail historically were intregung and I think all shoud read it.
4,TEDIOUS,"I found this book very interesting,and it went into extreme detail about medical problems and how they were solved,however, it went over and over about these things. I found it to be very tedious."
1,Shaman,I know this paperback was listed as used but the pages are so old and yellow and the print so faded that it is almost unreadable. I am very dissatisfied with this product.
5,Another fine novel from Nancy Baker Jacobs.,"I'm a longtime fan of Ms. Jacobs and hope that""Flashpoint"" is the start of a new series.This novel is just the right blend of mystery,suspense, and social commentary.Be sure to read Ms. Jacobs' other recent novels,""Star Struck"" and ""Double or Nothing""."
2,Not too sure about the value of this one,"Returned it, wasn't worth the price. My friend didn't notice it until I pointed it out, even with the lights on. Maybe it was because I didn't have a dark corner of walls to put it that it would be highlighted against. Maybe I just didn't arrange the stems well, but it was very tall (it tips over unless you put it in a tall heavy pot) and very straight up, and I couldn't get it to fluff out like it looks in the picture. Also, the lights are not integrated but look just like regular strings of christmas tree lights strung on bamboo stems. You also need your own decorative pot for it because it just comes with a little black plastic pot like you buy real plants in at the garden shop. I have seen much nicer looking artificial trees in home stores that already come in nice pots that I could just string my own lights on for 1/3 the price.Was otherwise very pleased with the easy Amazon return process."
3,Kino it ain't,"If you're expecting a restored picture for this price, forget it. The picture quality on this disc is pretty poor, dark and washed out. The score was good, which helped viewing. On the DVD is the 47 minute Shifting Sands and an 11 minute Mack Sennett Comedy called Skylarking from 1923. Unless you're a Swanson fan, rent it or skip it."
1,why is the rating so good?,"I bought this product because it showed up on the fist page(best selling product) + it had a good rating as well.But I was really disappointed because it hurts your skin when you use it to clean your face. Maybe good for foot?Although I've tried to use this gently(not giving too much pressure + making a circle) it will irritate your skin.If you are going to buy this one for first time, then I don't know what to tell you. If you have a sensitive skin then I would recommend you to get a gentle one. but this one was not good for me."
5,CAN'T LIVE W/O THEM,"HAVE USED THESE SPONGES FOR OVER 30 YEARS. IT GIVES MY SKIN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GLOW, I CAN'T LIVE W/O THEM."
4,"Nice product, hard to find!",The puff was very coarse so you must use very gently otherwise you may risk tearing your skin. I love the product and use it once or twice a week.
1,YAWN,"This cd wan not worth a penny. I admit, i only considered getting this cd cause it had a good price. Id rather save the penny ""plus shipping and handling"" then get it. I REGRET EVERYTHING."
2,not fast enough,"This does not have the speed nor the stamina to get the job done. would work very well as a teaser, but essentially that is all it is, a tease. if thats what your looking for that this is the toy for you!"
2,"You only get one, not three","This product works well, but assumed I was getting three peelers in this purchase because of the picture. I was very disappointed that for the price, including shipping, I only received one. The manufacturer should change the picture so that it isn't so misleading."
1,Broke on first Orange,The blade is sharp but easily broke on first attempt. Too delecate. I need to find my one piece plastic peeler that is shaped like this one but does a much better job.
3,Not PRO Series,"The cable I purchased is not the one pictured, and I can tell you why. Itis a 'bulk' style cable made by Belkin (I checked the UPC registry), NOTthe PRO Series pictured with the strain relief.The PRO Series from Belkin has the strain relief, model numbers ending in-S, e.g. A3L791-25-S purchased from Amazon. Be aware of this, I see otherreviewers complained also. The FastCAT 5e series also has strain relief,e.g. part #A3L850-07KS-MOD. The 'S' in the part # means strain relief aspart of the manufacture. Look for this when buying Belden cables and youwon't feel deceived or burned by the seller, unless they ship the wrongpart number to you. In this case make sure what you're buying first. Evenso I had no problem using these bulk style cables."
2,Hand made,"I purchased these patch cables with the understanding these were FACTORY TERMINATED patch cables from Belkin. The ad picture even shows a picture of a REAL Belkin cable, with factory terminated RJ45's.What I received was some Belkin cable with a HAND TERMINATED RJ45! If I wanted this, I could have made myself. I don't believe just because Belkin cable is used, this can be called a ""Belkin Patch Cable"".They are cheap. I didn't like them and I'm not using these cables anymore."
3,Works ok - not the best,"Works ok. Feels a little thin and prone to kinking. I'd probably buy something with a little heavier jacket next time. If you're just plugging in and leaving it alone, probably ok. For something that's coming in and out of your laptop bag all the time, I'd ugrade."
3,"Standard Ethernet Cables - Work, but not as described","I purchased three cables, they work fine, quality seems fine. As others have noted, these are not as pictured, they are standard crimped-end ethernet cables. I read other reviews, so I was prepared for this, but of course I could have preferred the cables pictured."
5,cat5 cable,This product is perfect for my application. The price is extremely affordable and is much better than purchasing locally - especially with free shipping.
1,NOT AS ADVIRTISED,The cables look cheap they are ONLY 6 feet long. The cables I ordered should be 10 feet long as advirtised and paid for
4,Could have come in a smaller box!,"The cable's alright, but the box it came was 2x1x1 feet! Why such a big box for a very small cable?? Could have come in a protected envelope!"
1,I'm pretty sure didn't work,"I was setting up a wired home network, and it wasn't working. I replaced this one with a 3 foot belkin cable (the blue one), and the network worked fine after that."
4,Good Belkin cable - but not as picture,"It's a good cable made by Belkin. It is not booted as depicted in picture, so if that matters, this is not the cable you want."
1,Cheap manual ends. Not factory ends.,"Even at this price, I would have expected factory terminated ends, not the crude manual ones that anyone can do themselves. They should really change the picture for this product."
3,Is hand crimped,"Like previous reviews, this ships to you hand-crimped, but factory-terminated is displayed in the picture. I was disappointed that it wasn't what I expected. I purchased a router with this and it turns out it had an Ethernet cable with it, plus another cable I ordered besides this to replace me other aging Ethernet cable. Im not going to return it because It would be to much hassle for something this inexpensive. So now its going to sit around my house until I may need it for something or if someone else I know might need it."
2,"i tried to find the good, i really did...","VERY, VERY experimental. I know hes trying new things and what not, but seriously folks.... this is not the sasha everyone has come to love. dont waste your money. if you havent heard sasha's San Francisco or his Ibiza albums, you should definetely purchase those."
3,Sasha is loosing his edge,"When I found this cd I immediatley purchased it,being a longtime devoted Sasha fan.All I can say is,other than two or three standout tracks most of the mix borders on being boring.I'm all for deep lush building sounscapes motivated by sasha's bottom heavy signature basslines.But some of the tracks here are just a little too sluggish and dont realy go very far.Maybe the fact that this is a live mix and not a studio mix has somthing to do with the low quality fillers here.Maybe I need to actualy be there at Avalon ,trashed to realy enjoy the mix .one thing I will say is Sasha does not sell out and go mainstrem,no matter what he keeps it underground and sounding spaced out!For that I'll give it three stars."
4,"Sasha --- Hypnotising, cool, deep house music","Great stuff from one of the pioneers of progressive. Sasha never ceases to amaze me. This live set is full of wicked electro, prog peak time grooves. His choice of mixes provide some cool atmospherics and the cd is just that...a nice electric bouncer with tech and trance influences. All round, an essentialprog release from Sasha."
2,"I WAS THERE, AND I WAS DISSAPOINTED.....","Maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe the Avalon was simply ready for a really thick, funky night. We were not in Ibiza-and Sashas set seemed to be geared towards a more mature, chill crowd..it might have worked on a beautiful island somewhere; but it sure didn't with the needy Hollywood crowd. I guess I thought he would have been able to sense that vibe and adapt accordingly. I have heard him do mindblowing sets that were pretty high energy and intense, but that did not take place on that nite. The DJ that was on before him was twice as good and probably got about 5% of Sasha's fee. Too bad. Buy something else by him...but not this. 2 stars because he has proven himself in the past, and it could have been worse."
1,Sasha is musically finished,"I kept repeating it from the in-famous US Delta heavy tour. Too bad, once upon a time he had his 5 minutes..."
4,Have A Nice Day: Volume 25!,"Volume 25 is one of the better Volumes of this series.Several good songs give a strong presence here. Personal favorites are, Lead Me On, Shake It, My Angel Baby, and , Love Takes Time, plus there is also one song on this Volume that I want to brag about and with good reason. I have always been a sucker for Ballads and there have been plenty of good ones over the years but two Ballads hit the airwaves in the latter 70s that I consider two of the best ever and one of them is right here being LeBlanc and Carr's, Falling. The other can be found on 1979 Billboard Top Hits called, Just When I Needed You Most, by the late great Randy Vanwarmer....Very Nice!It has been roughly 30 years since these 12 songs on this Volume hit the airwaves but most of them still sound fresh and not dated."
3,Jay Jay's Alright,"My boy is 2,and he loves Jay Jay! That's all he wants to watch. The downfall is that it doesn't teach any good values or any educational lessons. He also likes Barney and the Walt Disney World sing-a-long videos."
3,Venice replaces the narrator as the sensualist,"A novel about a journey that begins when the narrator discovers his HIV status. Thereafter, he journeys into the legends and narrations of Venice and Padua, suffucing the landscape with myth, legend, stories and passion. But in all that, he leaves out any exploration of his own sexual urges and promptings (erlaier referred to as 'adventures he wouldn't have been without'. His identity is purely that of journey-man. It is as if being HIV pos. ends sexuality and draws it into a dark room of past memories only, leaving the present/future blank. This isn't a gay novel, but the narrator is gay in a wholly vacant way. The perfum eof the stories suffocates the individuality of the author, and it is the author/narrator that is the shared point between reader and the contextas of the journey."
2,another bad hoffman,"This is the fourth Hoffman on DVD, all lacking something. This one has beautiful singing but that's where it stops. It is modernized and the villain wears a suit and sun glasses. In no way is he sinister or frigtening. The sets are beyond belief. The Barcarolle has to be seen to be believed. No water, just rows of undulating theater seats surrounding the singers. The worst sin if the casting as most members just don't look the part. Though Suzanne Mentzen sings beautifully she looks awful in the pants role of Nicklausse. And, at the conclusion,in a very brief stint as the Muse, she destroys it as she looks nothing like a Muse should. Many other cast members look like they walked in from Lulu or another opera. This is a Hoffman that would be better heard than seen."
1,Love Shicoff- staging stinks. More Crapola in modern dress.,"WHY DO THE HAVE TO SCREW THE OPERA UP WITH THESE HORRIBLE NEW ""MERDE"" PRODUCTIONS!! This production is un-watchable (for me, anyhow)."
1,Not pleased at all,"This is the 2cd time I have ordered an opera on DVD that contained nudity & there was no mention of this. I have family members who are too young to be shown this kind of content. Also the sets were distracting. This was certainly not the best production of Tales of Hoffman, although it may be the only one available on DVD. Hopefully there will be more to come. But I would hope that Amazon or the producer would be mature enough accept the responsibility to disclose such details like nudity so the discerning shopper can make a more informed decision."
5,A Moral Perspective,"Monetization of everything is only possible if you drink the economics Kool-Aid deeply enough to numb your senses of morality and justice. It's hard to escape the framework (paradigm) of reductionist Economics.There are many simultaneous vectors of value that can be considered including economic terms. Amartya Sen is on the right track and this book will give you a new perspective on the goals of development, the proper use of development tools, and better measures of success (or failure).Sen reveals data that is not found in the mainstream media to make his points in this accessible read.You may not change your mind, but you may think about the social value of money differently once you read this book."
5,Development as Freedom,"This is a fascinating short book that should expand the horizons of many people. It reminded me that economists tend to focus too much on income growth to the exclusion of other issues. In making the case that development increases freedom in many domains, the book remains very accessible and non-technical."
3,Perfect for the basis of a thesis,"If economic theory, public policy or development theories are not part of your day to day life, then this will be a very difficult book to get through. There are a lot of good points, obviously, but they're literally made in almost every sentence. In order to understand what Sen is explaining, I find it very hard to stay actively engaged in this book without Wikipedia open at the same time so that I can understand the deeper meaning of his philosophies. I've read almost 4 chapters now, and I really don't remember what I've actually read. Succinct sentences do not really seem to be the forte of this author. This is not ""light"" reading. I would not recommend this book to anyone without a graduate degree (which I do have) or currently pursuing a graduate degree (also me)."
1,Couldn't download the product,"For some reason, I couldn't download this book to my iPad, so I haven't been able to read it. I feel like I lost my money. It is the first time this happens to me with a product from Amazon.com."
4,Business Sense In A Not-So-Sensible World,"I can relate to to wisdom and clear trail of knowledge and experience easily and relevantly. I am reminded of the old saying that it is better to teach a man, or in the present context, also the woman, how to fish rather than to give a fish; I would go a bit further to amend the old saying even further: It would be still better yet to bring within the economic grasp of the majority the overall costs of the fishing pole, the bait and tackle, the fishing licenses, and so on."
4,Great,"A book that can open your mind, raise you up to a new level of the understanding of the economy."
1,Disappointing,"As a software ""old hand"" in embedded systems for way too many years, I ought to know better than to be taken in by the hype on this book. But, I blew it. This was a waste of money. The examples are misleading, the text is just plain wrong in far too many places, and the direction he takes in instructing is insulting. Then to cap it off, the compiler he wrote the examples for is very old. I have used Borland compilers since Turbo-Pascal days, and I used BC3.1 for years (still have it on one of my systems), but I would not recommend them today as they have been passed by. He obviously has had experience in embedded user interfaces, but this book will not help novices learn the how, where, or why of the subject in a way that they can use for the future. My recommendation is to pass on this one..."
4,Hawk Man!,"My son loves the superheroes and it was great to find this. I am not sure they are worth the money paid, but my son is happy. I hope this one holds up better than some of the ones we have bought at Walmart!"
3,JAKE LASSITER ** BOOK FIVE,"Jake Lassiter, former Miami footballer and lawyer about town has been a good series. Usually really really good in the court room, but not enough of that here. SLASHBACK misses. Several stories meant to come together never mess well and too much time away from court. Just not enough time to care about the characters and some seemed like caracatures. Like the series and will contiue but this one could be skipped."
3,entertaining,"A mystery set around wind sailing. Jack Lassiter, trial lawyer and wind sailor, finds himself deeply involved in a mystery of theft, murder and drug smuggling. The lafemme fatal character has him buffaloed when he tries to solve the murder of a long time friend and puts his own life in jeopardy as a result.Jack finds himself slightly bored with his present work of representing in court corporate grievances. This is an action filled novel with just the right amount of humor that is always present in life if one looks. Very entertaining."
3,An average legal thriller...,"...although it is quite short on the legal and long on the thriller.Attornty Jake Lassiter is on the trail of some missing bonds, stolen from an elderly client who has been duped by his young girlfriend. The search for the bonds leads Lassiter on a wild chase from Miami to the Bahamas and ultimately to Hawaii.I listened to this as an audiobook and found that it was an okay listen, it was not a great one. The reader, Robert Lawrence did an okay job, but neither he nor the book got me terribly enthused. It's not a bad book, but it sure isn't a great one either.I give this one a grade of C."
4,weird,Well what can I say about this CD My Sister had this on a 45 recordand now I have a CD and I have player it on air and I have had peopleringing me up wanting to know where to get it so I guess I might bedoing something right as it does bring back great memories
1,tripe,"if this 'music' were written today, it wouldbe too inconsequential to record--only 'splitlevel head' rises above the din--however, onedecent track out of twenty just doesn't cut it."
1,COMPLAINT,i AM taking this class a Illinoise Central College and My book has proven to contain many extreem wrong answers. I am comparing my book to other students books and the answers i have are different i would like a full refund and appology my grade and academic career has been tarnished because of this book thany you Jeremy Frazier 301 sterling Washington il 61571
2,This book could be a lot better.,Not enough examples. You would have to buy another book with more examples or get a tutor.
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this item to take close-ups of flowers and leaves. It allows no depth of field at any setting, so if your subject is not totally flat, forget it. The macro setting already on the camera does a much better job."
3,Different!,Kind of odd. The story of a storm in New England and how it affected people who were without power. Accounts of the storm are interspersed with hsitorical-fiction vignettes about how the areas was settled. The different parts of the story were not woven together well enough.
2,of very marginal use,"This should be a .pdf that you can download for free. Don't waste your money, just look at the internet."
2,The worst of Le Guin,"Fair warning! This book is nothing like a novel. It is a series of short stories interspersed with descriptions of rituals, fables, and other cultural descriptions. Although this book is highly imaginative, I found the format distasteful. It was hard for me to grasp the fullness of how these people lived even with all this information simply because most of it was lacking motivation. The characters seemed trapped by cultural expectations and really fail to develop. The plot in the few stories is likewise somewhat flattened by the attempt to continue to cultural exploration."
3,With apologies to Le Guin,"When this book first came out, I was extremely excited. I'd been a fan of LeGuin since I first saw 'Lathe of Heaven' on PBS during a fund drive. Since then, I've greedily scarfed up nearly every piece of s/f or fantasy that she's penned, and I've only been disappointed twice - this book and 'The Beginning Place'. (Okay, 'Tehanu' wasn't the greatest either). Even her earliest published works, such as 'Rocannon's World', have more depth. Buy this one to complete your collection - get the others first."
1,Not the right charger at all,"I read the reviews on this before I ordered and it is advertised as Nintendo DS AC Adapter. I was a little worried about the difference between the old and new DS but I thought I would take the risk. Well, I didn't need to worry about that because what I got is clearly not for the DS at all. The box this came in reads ""For Gameboy Advance SP"" and is not even close to what a Nintendo DS charger. Not sure if I got a completely wrong charger by mistake, but I am severely disappointed!"
1,does not work for ds,THis charger does not work for the DS it is the charger for the GBA SP. I contacted Amazon and informed them. I was sent a replacement and it was the same one which does not work for the DS. Do not buy this charger for the DS.
1,Network Specialist,This was not the right charger for Nintendo DS it was a charger for a Nintendo GameBoy Advance.
1,Wrong Product,I recently purchased this product before they changed the picture and description. The description clearly stated at the time that it was a Nintendo DS Lite adaptor. I contacted the company and they were willing to exchange it but I would have to pay return shipping. By the time I paid return shipping it would cost me as much as buying a new one so what was the point. Now that they have made updates to the products description I'm sure you will get what your looking for.
1,KNOW which DS you have!!,"I had no idea that there was more than one DS when I ordered this. There is the 1)DS, 2)DS Lite, & 3)DSi. This one only works for the very first DS that came out. My son apparently has the DS Lite. Don't waste your money like I did!"
1,Do not fit ds,This does not got to the ds I bought 3 and still can't charge them I would also like new ones please also waiting on email response !!
4,Nintendo DS AC Adapter,This does what I need it do. It works well for charging the DS so I can't complain really. Not sure why it is listed as a toy though! Works well ad would recommend.
1,know your product,"I ordered this and it came quickly and looks in good shape.Unfortunately, I now realize I have a DS-light not a DS. Big difference since this charger does not fit, so I inquired about refund.Sender got back to me in timely manner; but told me I have to pay for sending it back as well as a 20% restocking fee. Well the item is under $ 7.00, so this would pretty much eliminate my refund, so didn't bother. My message to everyone is...know your product well before you order...! P.s.There is an Energizer brand charger, that will charge all Nintendo + (Wall and car), $ 19.00"
5,ninetendo ds is fantabulous,i purchased a game that came wothout a charger so was very glad to be able to get one at such a reasonable price...it has been a fantabulous purchase...thank you for making it available
4,Nintendo DS AC Adapter,This product was sent to my daughter-in-law for my grandchild and I have not heard about it. I'm sure it is fine or she would have contacted me. Thanks Judith
5,Simple,It works and came quickly; a very cheep solution for a missing power cable. The cord seems to be just a few inches short of ideal length... maybe it is my house?
1,Not Good,This ds wall charger only lasted two months. Than broke. I ordered another one so hopefully this one lasts longer.
1,This is NOT a DS charger...,"Bought this charger for my daughter's DS. When I opened it, I discovered it is not a DS charger as the description indicates. This is actually a Gameboy Advance charger and will not work with the DS. The description is misleading."
1,This is NOT a DS Charger,"I have no idea what's wrong with this seller, but the charger I received was NOT a DS charger. Instead, it looked like a cell phone charger. The outlet that's supposed to go into the DS is WAY TOO BIG, it doesn't fit it. The item I received WAS not what I ordered and WAS NOT what comes out in the picture. I give this seller an F for failing."
1,Not what I thought it was,"I wish the seller had pointed out that this would not be compatible with a Nintendo ds lite. I foolishly assumed that they would both use the same adapter, but they don't. I have no use for this and have already pitched it in the trash. Live and learn."
2,will anyone ever need this?,"why would someone ever buy this? i dont think its needed. the nintendo ds comes with a charger already. and it charges the batteries thats already inside (i dont know which batteres, cuz i never put any batteries inside, but it works). you can alwasy just charge the batteries before a car trip. or charge it in a hotel room with the charger you already have. this charger is VERY NOT neccessary. unless of course u lose the one that came with the nintendo ds"
1,Do not order this! WASTE OF MONEY!,"I am so disappointed in this product, a total rip off! It states its a Nintendo DS adapter, but it is not! It states on the box ""Nintudo DS"" (misspelled on purpose).Looks like Nintendo DS logo, but a total scam! Read carefully what you purchase. It did not fit my Nintendo DS at all!I wouldn't recommend this at all! Waste of Money!!!"
3,NDS AC Adapter is okay for replacement.,"This adapter was perfect for my old NDS, the original DS with the big AC plugin. The only problem I had with it is that the cord length was too short. The cord only measures about 16 inches and original AC adapter's cord length is twice that. All in all, I was looking for a replacement and I got just that, but it would have been nice if the AC adapter I got was the same length as before."
3,Decent,"The product came fairly quickly. It serves it purpose and for the price its not a let down. It is a cheap knock off of a Nintendo Ds Charger. It charges, not much else can be asked for three dollars."
2,Not what I expected,I was under the impretion that this was a origonal DS charger instead I got a cheap rip off that i don't even trust to charge my system
1,NOT FOR DS,This adapter does not fit a Nintendo DS. Perhaps it is for 3DS??We have both a DS and DSi. It does not fit either of those.
1,Wrong product sent twice,"After purchasing this item online @ Amazon.com, Eforcity sent me the wrong product. I ordered a AC adapter for an Nintendo DS. What I received was not compatible at all. After I gave a poor review; Eforcity contacted me via email stating if I removed the poor rating they would send out the correct product at no cost to me. Well I did so before receiving the replacement and the second product I received from Eforcity was the same product sent the first time. I'm not sure if they are aware that the AC adapter they are advertising for the Nintendo DS is indeed the WRONG thing. It is in noway compatible with the Nintendo DS. After giving Eforcity a chance to correct the obvious mistake and them sending me the same exact product, I will never order another product from this company through Amazon.com or any other website."
1,Not what the description said :(,"This is NOT a Nintendo DS adapter, it's a game boy adapter and does NOT work with my daughter's DS. :("
2,Not exactly what was pictured,"Product was a GBA charger, not a DS charger. The GBA charger works for the DS, but is considerably bulkier."
1,Dissapointment...,This product is not what I expected. The quality is poor and it's not even worth the 2 dollars I paid for it. There is not much to say about this product but a simply DON'T BUY IT!!
2,DS Charger - WYSIWYG,Functional charger for original Nintendo DS (a.k.a. DS Phat). Unfortunately it only worked for two weeks and no longer gives a charge. It was a great two weeks followed by sudden sadness. Bottom Line: Buy two or look elsewhere for another equivalent product.
4,right size,"After reading reviews, it appeared that I might receive the wrong size adaptor for my original DS. This was not the case. I received the right size and am happily playing again. Very satisfied."
2,Wrong charger,This was not the correct charger for my childrens DS games. It might be a good idea to find out which unit this charger really goes to.
2,poorly written & organized,"I am a pacifist on practical, rather than religious, grounds, but I wanted to read this booklet (not really a book-- only forty-five pages) to ground myself in the Christian concepts. It did provide me with some information, but it was very poorly organized and written, to the point of distraction. I cannot recommend this for any but the true scholar, who's already been through other materials and is looking simply for perspective."
1,never received my orde,Ive written the company and attempted to follow FedEx but no luck. The charge has already hit my credit card several weeks ago but still no book.
1,Persistent Random Zone Errors,"This started out as a great sprinkler controller for the first several years with no problems at all, but now I get zone errors randomly on any of the valves connected to it. Valves open and run fine when executed manually, but when run through a program often one or more zones will error out and not turn on. Research on Google shows I am not the only one experiencing zone faults with this controller. Now I am replacing this controller with one hopefully more reliable than this, and would not recommend the ISM-series controllers to anybody. Consider yourself forewarned if you decide to buy one anyway."
3,No problems but a little quirky,I installed this station timer after my last one was shorted by lightning. I had no problems and it seems like a good timer for the money. I found setting the watering times a little quirky but then maybe I should've read the instructions.
4,Just What I Was Looking For,"Up to now, I have discovered books that contained AI code samples but out of context for what I needed. The code was specific and merely a part of collections of examples. I finally found this book. It explains all the game genres in terms of AI capability and requirements albeit rather technical in some places that I appreciated as reference. I have not completed the book yet but the contents are allowing me to create my own AI Engine that includes all the types in the book. Just to gain experience and knowledge and add to my portfolio. I strongly recommend this book for both it's content and the CD contents. --Joe"
2,"Scattered, superficial treatment","The book is trying to do too much but end up delivering little. There is also not enough code to illustrate the concepts. I would recommend Matt Buckland's AI books if you are actually looking for a practical guide to help you develop your own AI system. If you must buy, check it in the bookstore before you do."
1,Soo little to offer,"This book is awful, i have read this as well as the earlier book by the same name from this author. This book is 75 percent completely useless filler, not to mention the code examples are overflowing with unimaginable bugs (functions definitions with no return types, basic logic and syntax errors and much worse), obviously they did not bother even trying to compile any of them and you will spend a significant amount of time fixing all these issues. This is not worth a purchase at any price greater than 3 dollars, you are better of searching google for information from various websites if you need a book any alternative is better."
4,So and so....,well as i skimmed through the book it was all good. i wish there was more examples. i haven't checked out the cd yet but other than that i still love the book. just one thing though. when i got mines it sort of had a big torn on the book so it looked like two different books flapping together. other than that the book was still in mint condition.
5,One of America's Very Best Singer/Songwriters,"I had the opportunity to listen to every cut on ""Little Fugitive"" and I can say with 100% certainty that this is Ms. Rigby's strongest album to date. In fact, I can't remember a non-greatest hits CD by anyone that is this consistently wonderful from beginning to end. Each song could easily be the best song on someone else's CD. Critics should stop comparing Amy to other artists, because the fact is, there is no one like Amy. No one can touch her intelligent lyrics. They are so consistently strong that I worry some listeners don't realize what a great composer of music she is. Unlike so many other talented songwriters, none of her songs sound like any of her other songs. Melodically, each stands on its own. This woman is a songwriting genius worthy of wide acclaim. It is time for her fame to grow exponentially."
4,Brilliant without denial !,"This is simply one of the more refreshing , energetic and original cd's to come out in the last 20 years.My favorite cuts are"" Like Rasputin ""and "" Always with Me"""" Joey Ramone "" is also a gem.Highly recommend !"
5,Amy's Amusing Songs,"Amy's lyrics are often amusing and the tunes with them are very good also. The CD is fun to listen to, and I like it when the song lyrics are included."
3,"Hilariously fun, easily dismantled","When I first received it I thought it was broken because I couldn't set off the duck noise, but a quick toss onto the floor or a strong chop will set off the noise, much to the joy of my two Jack Russell Terrier puppies. Chance, who's afraid of his own shadow, will toss it and shake it and then look at it in amazement when it quacks at him. He could play with this toy for weeks. Kaylee, who fears nothing, on the other hand, has already chewed both feet off and is working on dismantling one of the wings. It might last another day or two in her presence."
3,Made in China. Pretty small. Not your average toy size.,"I bought the Kyjen Duck and Pig, and all I can say is wow... Are they small or what! This isn't Amazon's or Kyjen's error. In fact, it is mine. I should have read the description. I purchased this for around $6.00 through Amazon (give or take a few pennies). For a toy this small, it is borderline expensive... Especially considering the fact that it IS made in China. The pig has a sound box inside it, which does deliver noise to entice a dog's curiosity. I don't think this will stand the test of time though, even if you're like me and you supervise all toy play time with your dog."
2,cheep tiny duck,"my dog ripped it apart in 5 min but it was fun watching him kill it, wouldn't buy it again"
5,The Authoritative Guide to Lessing,"This comprehensive compilation represents the standard for indexing the works of any historical author. The proofreading is impeccable, and the research exhaustive.The compiler, a long-time professor of Germanic Language & Literature at Rice University and the University of Iowa, died 11/23/05 at age 74."
3,"If you're already doing this, a great book; otherwise, not","So, if you've already made the decision to go with software product lines, this is an excellent book. It's got a huge amount of reference material, is well-edited, and clearly has the benefit of a lot of practical experience.Unfortunately, if you're debating with or just want to learn about software product lines, this book isn't for you. I didn't see a single example of when software product lines are *not* appropriate for a set of work that needs to be done and, in general, this just assumes that you already have the sort of work that fits this model and dives right into the details. Also, the ""29 practices"" are spread over just under 300 pages, and make it hard to understand the big picture. It would've been nice to see even one-page descriptions of the patterns in context to be able to pull it all together more easily."
2,Anthony Robbins Wealth DVD - had too many skips - defective,I enjoyed what I heard on the DVD before it began skipping - about 30 minutes into the DVD - after that it was a miserable experience. If I can replace it - order another one from Anthony Robbins' site - I'm sure I would enjoy it. v
3,"These are AA batteries, not AAA as stated","The photo is correct: these are AA batteries, not AAA as in the product description."
3,It's okay,This is the movie where the evil puppets become good. It's good if your a fan of the first two movies.
4,An eminent book!,"Beyond the Mango Tree was an exciting four star book.It is about an American girl who moves to Liberia,in Africa because her dad is offered a job here.It was exciting because one night thieves came to her house and the guard was hit on the head and almost died and Sarina, the main character, was left alone.This book is also sad because even when Sarina doesn't do anything wrong her mother ties her to a tree and makes her stand in a dark muddy puddle. I have never read anything like this book before and recommend it to readers of all ages."
1,a good idea gone wrong,"I reviewed this book for my gigh school class after hearing all the praise for it. I was fairly shocked by the unrealistic portrayal of diabetics, how the author irresponsibly portrays them as mentally ill. As for the story itself, it is not terrible, but very bland. The writing was another problem, the author felt that she should use a foriegn dialect without insight as to the meaning of what to me were nonsense words.Overall I would steer clear of this book, especially if your thinking about a lesson with it, I'm not sure these other critics read the same book as I, if they did, I would have to wonder what substance they abused while reading it."
4,UTOPIA Gets their POV across,"This re-issue represents the compilation of two of Todd Rundgren and Utopia's best later-period recordings (early-to-mid '80s). I especially liked the 2nd of these, ""POV,"" as one of the bands most creative and heavy-duty recordings. The songs are rich in thought and angst for the most part - try ""Zen Machine"" on for size for a good headrush!A bargain at twice the price. The repackage has great songs, production, and enough lyrical content to give one serious pause. And like the majority of Rundgren's best work, he absolutely tears it up on guitar. If you like sophisticated-yet-accessible rock music, then Dawn Atom says 'check this out!'"
4,Unknown Utopia,I ordered this recently because I didn't know about it in the eighties. It must have had a limited release. I'm loving it. It's like a gift of 23 new Utopia songs to me. It has the classic sound and is lots of fun. I highly recommend it.
2,No closed captioning,"I bought #1-3 of this classic collection and you would think by now there would be subtitles/CC. Even with the sound as loud as it could be and running at slow speed I could not catch a lot of the of the lines. This is not only frustrating but you miss some of the plot/clues. Needless to say I am returning #2 & 3. I agree with the other reviewer, there could have been better specials. Show 5+ but no CC 0."
1,"Good idea, terrible execution","The parallels betwen mysticism and Judaism are fascinating, but not in this book. These snippets are too vague for younger readers and too didactic for older ones. As difficult as it must be to make this subject matter dull, Schwartz achieves just that."
3,WARNING!: Toning Balls needed,"On-line they're tougher to come by to shop for. Also, I'm slender & under 5'4"" so my hands are... well youth sized (tiny!). She does have somewhat fast paces (unlike the other dvds of Karen's that I've owned & used for years) with dance like moves. 3lb toning balls are almost 5"" around.The dvd was affordable but shopping for even 2lb toning balls are tougher along with the shipping cost- YIKES!Karen always has excellent production in her videos & instructions with helpful cues to keep form/keep going.Unfortunately- this one just isn't for me."
4,Fast Moving WorkOut,"This workout moves fast! Not in a bad way that's too hard to keep up with, but enough that after several times, i'm still not sick of it. My only complaint would be that I'm not totally sore the next day - but it really is a great way to start your day and passes 30 mins for a workout really quickly!2 30 min segments - one for am the other for pm. The am workout is mostly cardio and some free wieghts - she really moves you quickly through the workout without too many dance moves, yet fast enough to be interesting. The pm workout is a really amazing ab workout. It took a few times before I could get through the whole thing! (And I AM able to get through Tamilee Webb's ""I want that body"" abs section... so that says a lot!)"
4,Its not hard but its a good video,"I bought this video at fye for like 5 dollars a really long time ago. I love it, it is the reason i got into yoga becaues i just wanted to know more about yoga. the moves are easy and i love the ab routine in the night one. Its a good dvd for any level."
4,Streamline Fitness,"This was my first Karen Voight video, my other videos are by The Firm. I really liked her attention to detail and cuing better than The Firm. The first 30 min. is strenth training for upper and lower body, while I liked it, I would have prefered a harder workout. The second 30 min. covers abs, back and long yoga stretch. This was great. I've done this tape several times and my abs can feel it. I usually rotate the second half into most of my workouts and only do the whole tape when I don't want to work that hard. Worth the money."
4,A Real Eye-Opener,"As a Mormon, we were always taught that the leaders of the Protestant Reformation were heroes. What a surprise to encounter a book that regards Luther in the same light as Lenin or Robespierre; the igniter of a conflagration the engulfed Europe. Marius also has some profound things to say about the doctrine of grace and how it severs the connection between moral responsibility and quotidian human behavior. This book is terrific for any thinking Christian."
1,0 Rating!,"If you are looking for a good bio on Martin Luther, go somewhere else. This book is one of those that enjoys tearing down the character of someone so dead they can't defend themselves. It takes a detailed study of Martin Luther's psychological makeup which is embarrassing, weird, and untracable. I would recommend burning your copy if you have one. Maybe I sound extreme, but once you'll read this book you'll regret having wasted the time and money too. I feel less intelligent for having read this book."
1,Richard Marius: the writer between a rock and a hard place,"Poor Richard Marius. You figure a guy with such little use for Christianity would choose another topic to expend so much blood, sweat and tears on.I mean really. His contempt for any brand of that religion is so obvious after reading this book that I can't help but wonder why he bothered to write it all.Who knows, maybe some guys get their kicks out of trashing other people's religious traditions for no good reason other than to score points with his bigshot, Harvard University cronies.Well congratulations Richard, you succeeded. I hope the cocktail party accolades you received were worth the effort."
1,A very sour account of an exemplary life...,"Richard Marius has written a biography chock-full of untempered, atheistic fervor. Martin Luther was an extraordinary man and his legacy, and theology live on in the hearts of millions of followers. Why would a biographer choose a subject he seems to care so little for? The seething sarcasm and anti-religious sentiment in this book make it difficult to read. This book is more a presentation of the author's atheism than the life of Martin Luther. I detect hypocrisy not from this departed Christian man (Luther) but his biographer! If you are an atheist, then by all means, stick with subjects who share something of your lifestyle and beliefs (or lack thereof)."
1,an atheist review,"The inside jacket of this book states that David Marius' thesis is that Martin Luther was human and afraid of death.WOW. How long did it take him to come up with that one? And this guy teaches at Harvard, that's pretty sad.This book manages to tell the story of Martin Luther's life without being sympathetic to either Luther and the people who believed in him or Luther's enemies. Furthermore, as a practicing Catholic, I don't know if I find it more insulting or pathetic that the author consistently uses the bigoted term ""papists"" to refer to Catholics.I wonder if he plans on writing a book on the civil rights movement using the ""n-word... David Marius is obviously an anti-religious bigot and an atheist who has absolutely no business writing on any topic that has to deal with religion..."
2,Ok as a beginner's book but connoisseurs want better,"I think that Marius is simply wrong on a number of points and his disdainful attitude toward Protestant Christianity in the present makes it difficult for him to really understand what was going on in the Reformation. If you want a more even-handed and multifaceted picture of Luther, look at Heiko Oberman's book, where Marius obviously got some impetus for his title, or even Roland Bainton's older but still useful book, Here I Stand. A lot of this is just rehashed Erik Erikson, and Erikson does it a lot better."
3,Biased account still shows Luther's greatness and talent,"As noted by some of the other reviewers, Marius's work is severely biased against Luther. Marius seems to blame Luther for the chaos of the last 500 years, starting with the wars that followed Luther's death. In my opinion, he seems to forget the chaos that has always surrounded our history.In spite of his disapproval of Luther, he is not a liar and through his views of Luther's actions and ideas I was still able to see Luther as an extraordinary man of great talent. In some ways, Marius was even more complementary of Luther than other authors I have read.If you are religiously inclined and are looking for a general work on Luther I would suggest instead Roland Bainton's Here I Stand or even the more recent work Luther the Reformer by Kittelson."
3,Roman Catholic? What have you been drinking?,I knew Richard Marius quite well and can assure you he had as little use for Roman Catholicism ans Protestantism--if you don't believe me read his book on Thomas More. Richard was a great debunker--esp of people held up as icons. I cannot vouch for the scholarship of Richard's book but trust me if you think he is taking a Roman Catholic line you have been drinking too much Communion Wine.

5,Excellent Case!,This Computer case/overnight Samsonite bag is perfect! It rolls like it is on marble (even through the rough parking lot and in rain!) it holds much more than I previously expected too. I would highly recommend this bag to anyone searching as it is taller yet narrower than most so fits through the airplane isles with ease. Great buy.
4,It is very good and truly functional.,This product is really good; does what it is supposed to do. Neat that it has a computer pouch in it too. Has lots of space and can carry lots of things. Used recently on an overnight trip and was pleased with it. Easy to wheel along inside plane aisles. Using it regularly during week for work. Recommend strongly.Dr. R.S.
3,Reasonable But Not Great,"I have been making sushi for about a year and bought this book in the hopes of obtaining a reference for basic techniques and a guide to new new techniques. Overall I am happy with the book, but not as happy as I had hoped. Although there are some good ideas for exotic sushi, there really isn't much included in the way of basic techniques. Techniques for preparing Nigiri-zushi aren't even discussed. Novices would be better off looking elsewhere for instruction; I would recommend The Book of Sushi. Still this can be a vaulable book for intermediate sushi chefs and does include a variety of interesting sushi ideas such as squid sushi. Aditionally, this book is written by a japanese author seemingly for a japanese audience; western readers may have trouble finding some ingredients."
4,"Great Ideas, more descriptions for the novice needed","If you are looking for far out, wacky ideas or new sushi techniques- this is the book for you. Imagine a Sushi birthday cake !.If you are new to making sushi, rather get a more wordy book."
3,Not what you would expect,"Although it has some beautiful photos, this book does not teach one to prepare the basic sushi styles that we are used to. Instead, it presents a number of sushi ""recipes"" for elaborate dishes which happen to include sushi-style fish. The beginner would do well to read ""The Book of Sushi"" before trying this book."
5,finally!!!!!!,"I love this book. I'd recommend this book for EVERYONE- and that includes those people out there who still feel uncomfortable around homosexuals. Plus- this is the first junior high book I've read dealing with prejudice against gays and lesbians. What I also like about this book is that it also deals with Janice learning about why other people think their own way; at the end she doesn't say 'Oh, this person is right and that person is wrong.' This is one of the main reasons I like this book."
5,What a hidden gem,"I am a Christmas Music junkie, I picked this up used, and had to log on to tell people about it. This is a great CD, and usually there are only one or two pieces on a compilation that you like, but the majority of these are great! And one of the swingingest versions of silent night I have ever heard (which is a pretty rare feat!!)"
4,2 versions,"Be careful! There are two versions of this book. You want to read the newer version, so you can get the whole story. Both versions are great. It is an inspirational true story written by a mother of a child with a severe disability. It discusses the mother's courageous attempts to better the quality of her daughter's life, when that was not the normal."
3,Encouragement for parents of severely disabled kids at home,"This is the story of a woman who chose to raise her severely disabled child at home, at a time when doctors recommended putting brain damaged children in an institution and forgetting about them. Nicola's motivation to keep her daughter with her at all costs was inspiring.I did not finish the book feeling convinced that Catherine knows she's there, but Nicola knows Catherine is there, and that is what seemed to work for the family as Nicola struggled to get her daughter what she deserved.This book is about a mother's love for her daughter and her acceptance of, and her pride in, her daughter as she is."
1,Is it or isn't it coming?,It was supposed to be released in April. In June I got an email response from Wiley saying that they aren't going to publish the book at all. The book remains for sale on Amazon. I decided to order it anyway and Amazon says it is supposed to ship between Aug 5 and Aug 19... We shall see. When calling around to bricks and mortar book stores they say they can order it and have it in 2 days... I don't think they know what they are talking about either... How about an update on the *real* status of this book!!!
3,Not as good as the first two...,"...but still better than most stuff out there (at least the first half). If you've never heard Psycho Realm before, buy War Book I.The first half of the album is classic Psycho Realm (although not at their best). The second half makes you witness Jacken revert from lyrical genious to common rapper talking about the same themes lesser rappers spit about, namely...drugs & women (and to give it the killing blow...Duke is not on the second half, tragically.)"
4,wow- even i was suprised!,thsi is a great album overall. honestly- without b-real of cypress hill- i did not think they would make it. but- they actually stand on their own. thier lyrics are very ear friendly to those lyric lovers. not to mention the production- dark and raw- match the topics perfect. i did not give it 5 stars due to the fact the last couple of tracks get too ....wack- like the last four or so. but even that- the first ten or so are hot! most releases today only have one or two good songs. see? this cd is well worth the purchase.
2,Great readings - Terrible packaging and production,"This expensive item would be a wonderful collection if it were put together in a way that made it easier to find the poems. The fancy booklet that comes with it includes no readable table of contents. The actual CDs are unmarked, so that if you want to find a poem you have to look in the CD case for the poem, and the poems are listed all together in a paragraph. This is extremely awkward. To find a poem you really have to skip through the CD track by track. I wish that the producers would repackage this in a form that was easier to use. They have the recordings, some of them rare, and all of them interesting. But again, terrible decisions about packaging and organization."
2,mistake,it was totally a mistake that I ordered this one on line.Cost me a lot of money and there is nothing different from other notebooks
5,Rock it's what we're all about,it is one of the best cd's that i have listened to in my entire life.
2,"Lovely to look at, not to hear","I must respectfully disagree with the previous reviewers in that I found the singing mostly inept. There have been three other telecasts in Europe with better singers; see if you can track them down. Sound is excellent, production is beautiful, conducting very slack and some of the singing quite painful."
2,"Poor quality, bad packaging","Sorry, but this is just not a good product. I understand that this is not intended to be a classy light fixture, and it's simple to the extreme, but the ""stainless"" casing is just cheap, flimsy, metal, it is just not a solid product. Plus the packaging had exactly no cushioning so when I opened the package there were about 5 or 6 noticeable dents in the metal casing. I don't have the time to return and get a new one, so I took a pair of pliers tried to fix the dents...I didn't get it perfect, and frankly, the fact that I had to do this at all on a new product is really annoying. And then it doesn't even come with the little plastic electrical wiring connectors... Again, really annoying. Considering that you can buy a solid light fixture at Lowes or Home Depot for less than $20, the fact that this product approaches $30 is a little nuts. Two stars was generous, but to be fair the lights do work, and it was fairly easy to install."
5,Wonderful collection!,My son gave this book to me for my birthday - he's only 2 so his daddy did a great job of picking it out. I love to read him the classics and the illustrations are very endearing. Thanks honey for a wonderful birthday gift and thanks to the editor for making this collection available to us moms.
5,A Favorite!,"I received this book from my husband for my first mother's day and I love it! I was looking for a bedtime storybook that had all the favorites in it and this is definately the one! It has all the most loved songs, stories and rhymes. The recipes, poems and games are an added bonus! I recommend this book to all the new moms...and dads!"
5,Nostalgia!,"What a wonderful book! This book reminds me of my childhood - the songs, stories and games are classics that every child should know. This makes a great gift for a new mother!"
3,"Really cute, but then you start to read it...","I really liked this book when I picked it up at the store. I thought it was cute, great illustrations, old fashioned looking, had some nice nursery rhymes. Great, I bought it.Then I picked it up one night to read some of the fairy tales to my daughter. And I couldn't -- they were really weird versions of fairy tales. Maybe they're PC or something, but they were really odd.So it was really cute, and they got me to buy it, but I can't recommend it to anyone else."
1,A no go,I thought this was for a grill and my boyfriend almost burnt his hand off using this on the grill. We use it for the oven when we could use just a regular mitt.
1,arrived w/ mildew smell,"I wonder what damp warehouse is liquidating this supply of mildewed-smelling oven mits. And indeed, as the other reviewer said, its tag claims it's only good up to 200F. It remains to be seen if a washing will remove the mildew smell."
1,You people should be ashamed of yourselves.,"I honestly have no idea why all these people (the five of them who have deigned to review it) failed to recognize the hideous 'Evil' contained herein. Otherwise of course, this album is a true tour de force."
5,Cactus is Back!!!,"Even though I have all the albums that these cuts came off of, this is a great collection. I would have picked most of the same songs if I was putting it together. I wish that live album that was released a while back wasn't so hard to get and expensive, but that may change because these guys are back together. They are playing NYC and a rock festival in Europe in June and are going to release a new album soon. The original band is back, with the exception of Rusty Day who was murdered in the 1980's. Appice and Bogart have been touring with athe original Vanilla Fudge lately and Jim McCartey has been keeping his chops hot playing in local Detroit bars for the past 25 years. I don't think these guys realize the fan base that is out there, and once they do we should be getting a lot more touring and product out of them so we can make sure these guys die rich old men. Damn, life does get better as you age!!! Rock on Cactus!!!"
4,Ballsy,"This was the first rock group that I listened to as a young teenager. For power, raunchiness this was the ballsiest music I ever heard. It wasn't until I heard Deep Purple IN ROCK did anything compare with regard to power. Not for the feint of heart."
2,cracks with every step,"This cane wiggles and cracks with every step and within 2 weeks, the paint started chipping. I would not recommend."
3,Cute but clumsey,"I bought the green cyclone. The good points: very good quality, stable and secure, folds up, not expensive. Clumsey points: falls over every time you put it down! and you can't hang it up. So I took a bright gold gross grain ribbon and added pom poms to the ends made a loop and tied that on the shaft. That makes it possible to hang it, be easily seen, and identified...and cute. Unfortunately it's uncomfotable on the wrist when I need or want to temporarily suspend it to use both of my hands.You get the picutre.My need for a cane is temporary and possibly intermittent as a security blanket. In retrospec, I would buy the vinyl covered hook institutional cane if I had a long term serious need for one."
5,folding cane,I get a lot of compliments on this cane. I like that I can fold it up and stiock it in a bag when i'm not using it.
1,Product did not match online photo!!! Awful.,"I purchased this cane for my grandmother because it was a great price and, judging from the photos provided, it was pretty and feminine. Unfortunately, when the cane arrived it was atrocious. it did not match the photos from the internet -- the flowers were bright and gaudy, not delicate and subtle like we had been lead to believe. My grandma asked us why we would have puchased such a cheap looking thing for her! We returned it right away. I will give you this, Duro-Med was very responsive to the return and refunded my money quickly and easily."
5,So what if I have to use a cane,"When I had to have a total knee replacement at a younger than I would like age, I balked about using a cane to aid in my recovery. Then I clicked on Amazon and found this adorable Floral Folding cane. Talk about a conversation piece! All my fellow patients in the rehab center were ohhing and ahhing and wanted one just like it for themselves. A very good buy!"
4,sturdy and convenient,"The cane folds, but you need to put it in the bag, or otherwise constrain it, or it will unfold automatically. There should be a built in velcro strap to constrain it when folded. A padded handle would be nice too. But for the price, it is very good."
4,Billy Kennedy,"I found this book to be very informative. It provides some information genealogically and describes the historical perspective of the region. I bought both the Carolinas and the Tennessee book and found that there was repetition. Therefore, I recommend buying one book on the Scotch-Irish written by Mr. Kennedy. I preferred the Carolinas book."
1,Handle with care,"This book is attractive, but it has many flaws in content and in many ways is just plain sloppy -- poorly written and poorly edited. The author has no notes, so it is very difficult to tell his sources unless they are from very well known individuals (generals, religious leaders, etc.), and when one compares the original words of these people with what Kennedy quotes them as saying, one finds that Kennedy often misquotes them. Much other information is inaccurate as well, so this book cannot be trusted by genealogists or anyone else. The book is full of statements like ""Davy Crockett was elected to represent Tennessee in the White House"" (no, he was elected to Congress) that show that the author either wrote too quickly or did not have anyone review his work or worse. Too bad, because the subject matter has great appeal."
4,An excellent reading book,"If you have ever wondered if your Tennessee ancestor was Scots-Irish, then this book will answer some of your questions. The book is an easy read and one I will be recommending to the relatives that want to know why ancestors left Scotland, went to Ireland and ended up in the colonies. Especially interesting for those wanting a nice-to-read book is the treatment of well known people like Daniel Boone, Sam Houston, TN Gov. Blount., and others. If you want a comprehensive treatment for further research, then this is probably not the book for you. I found Mr. Kennedy to be very entertaining while delivering excellent summaries of genealogical and historical information."
2,Leaves me thirsting for more,"I bought this book because my ancestors were mostly Scots Irish and I wanted to lean more about them.I loved the background information in Billy's book that tells about the character and beliefs of the Scots Irish and the Presbyterians.I thought that more data about the common every day Scots Irish Immigrants to America shoud have been the main focas of the book.It's interesing to know that many of the immigants became famous, but I'm not as intested in them as I am the ordinary people. After all, we can read about them in almost any American history book.I stopped reading the book after the background information. It didn't go far enough into those details for me."
5,Scotts/Irish Book Gift,"Purchase was sent as a gift to a friend. I already owned an earlier copy of the book, and the recipient was very pleased to also have a copy. The item arrived much earlier than expected, and was definitely a successful effort. If given another opportunity, I would definitely purchase from this vendor."
4,Lonetree Ranchers: Colt,I was very happy with the third book of this series. I would recommend this series to anyone who loves a good romance.
2,From Back Cover,"THE GALLANT COWBOY: Brant WakefieldHIS PROFILE: Daring, dependable and devastatingly handsomeHIS SOFT SPOT: Damsels in distressWhen Brant found a lovely lady knocking on his hotel balcony door, he was intrigued. And when he discovered that Annie Deveraux was hiding from a spurned suitor, his code of honor demanded that he help her. But once he whisked her away to his ranch for safekeeping, he was beset with incomprehensible yearnings. For although he was boots and tight-fitting jeans and she was pearls and pink sweater sets, Annie affected him like no other woman ever had. And the more time Brant spent with the innocent virgin, the more he realized that, although he mustn't touch Annie, he couldn't let her go...1st in the Lonetree Ranchers series."
1,Nintendo DS Stylus Pen-disappointing,"I love the Nintendo DS system, but the stylus pen it not working for me. I am a woman, with average hands, but the pen is too short, and causes my hand to cramp. If it were a bit longer, I wouldn't have to keep stopping and shaking and rubbing my hand."
2,Third party product,"When ordering a stylus, beware. The picture might be of an authentic Nintendo DS Stylus 3 PK, but the independent seller might be providing a third party product - one that is not made by Nintendo. The stylus does fit into the Nintendo DS, but is not the same quality."
3,Not real Nintendo product,"What you get is a third party product. While they do work, they are thinner so they fall out of the stylus slot. My kids have a hard enough time keeping track of the real ones that do fit snuggly in the slot!"
2,"Be Careful, You Might End Up With a Third Party Product",I recently ordered this product and when it came to me I didn't get what I was expecting. I did not recieve an official Nintendo product and instead I got third party styli. Also the product was not new and the styli were in a small plastic zip-loc bag. The styli work just fine however they are not of the Nintendo brand and they are not new. Just be careful if you order this becuase you might not recieve the product you had in mind.
1,Still haven't recieved this item,"I ordered this on 12/08 and have yet to see it as of 1/15/07. The estimated delivery is now Jan 30th. Needless to say, I could have found it locally weeks ago."
1,Terrible for a laptop,"I got this computer with high hopes.I turned it on and started working with it, only to notice the whole palm area was too hot to work with.This computer heats up and not only on the bottom (you can't really put it in your lap and work) but also on top. So I was not able to put my palms on the computer and type. There seemed to be no heat displacement feature. When I called them, they said they never heard of it before, and to return it.So I returned it and got a toshiba."
4,Quite familiar,"I waited for six months to read Dan's book, and I finished it in about 5 hours. It was fast-moving and interesting--a nice debut.However, I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone who has not been a part of the NCAA distance running experience. The characters he describes and events he details are strikingly familiar to those of us who run, but they would be just a strikingly foreign to those who have never competed at a high level. Readers who do not comprehend the drive of a distance runner would likewise not fully comprehend the forces behind many of the book's major events.It's comforting, though perhaps a tad disturbing, to see that many collegiate runners live the same life I did in college. Dan's book was probably as nostalgic for me as it was for him, and I'm sure that most runners would agree."
1,Petty,"This is a very negative and petty book, it does not motivate or inspire in any way. It is whiny, plaintive, and boring. I hope you got it out of your system Dan."
4,dream your dreams,dan middleman's account of a nationally recognized collegiate distance runner is hauntingly familiar what many college stars deal with today. the author describes in great detail the intense desire to perform at a level which would earn his character respect and also give reason to choose a life of a professional athlete. we are led on a roller coaster ride from a wild relationship with a woman 10 years his senior to wild parties his fellow teammates have. we experience the maturation from a boy into a man. overall mr. middleman succeeds in delivering a piece which is easy and enjoyable to read.
1,Avoid!,"This is, without exception, the worst book I have ever ordered from Amazon, and probably the worst I have bought anywhere. It is written in the style of the school essay of a 12 year old, there is minimal character development, numerous contradictions (for example, in one sentence the main character was nauseous with nerves befors a big race, 3 sentences later he was 'like a machine'), and [...]. I very rarely discard books, but this was in the bin once I passed the half way stage and there was no improvement. Is it possible to give less than 1 star?Sports Fan."
2,Depression inducing,"I am not for the censorship of depressing material. However, this one really pushes it. I pushed through the book and was left disappointed at the end. While I can find how someone can relate to the character, I found it simply too depressing. In other words, I didn't see the point of reading the book."
3,"Psychic Hotline, Retro-Style; and, The Last Road To Eternity","Twilight Zone enthusiasts will enjoy this tale of fortune cookie wisdon gone arye. A newlywed couple, in the fifties, stop at a small diner and enter the Twilight Zone. William Shatner stars as the husband, obsessed with the fortune dispensing machine, much to his brides' dismay. Who will triumph, Shatner, or "" Ole Nick "". A must see episode for Shatner fans. A frail southern woman, during the Civil War, desparately awaits her husbands return from the battlefield as she watches the ""Passers-By"", on the road at the edge of her property. The constant dabbing at her brow, with her handkercheif, and her anxious demeanor, arouse suspision. Through her conversations, with several travellers, she comes to a startling realization. A predictable, yet worthwhile selection."

2,"Wonderful Violin Concerto, dismal Double Concerto","I gave a rave to this classic Brahms Violin Concerto, which has now been remastered in excellent sound by EMI. This is the original EMI References recording, however, which is in much poorer sound. (See my review under the reissue.)I just wanted to add a note about the 1952 Double Concerto. Furtwangler conducts the Vienna Phil. in a radio broadcast that has been captured in dismal, edgy sound, not even as good as the Lucerne Festival sonics for the Violin Concerto. The soloists are Willi Boskovsky and Emanuel Barbec, first desks in the orchestra. This is a work that benefits from a spirited, not-too-rugged approach. Unfortunately, Furtwangler is ponderously slow, and the soloists dig into every note like a dentist going after old fillings. Two stars."
4,Good CD,"Albert React has always been an underappreciated band. I feel very strongly that this CD is one of the best of 2006. They have toned down their sound going from post hardcoreish to complete indie experimental bliss. Gabe's vocals soar on this album. I really think he has one of the best voices in this genre. I can't stress enough how much people should get this. If you are into bands like the appleseed cast, you need to own this. I am very saddened that Albert React didn't get signed by a better label, no offense to CI but the world needs to be able to enjoy this music. I would say tracks 2-5 are the best. The only complaint would be that the vocals might have been recorded too low? I don't know much about that type of stuff though. So buy this CD.EDIT:18 months later, I wish I gave this CD 5 stars. It is really a great album. Love it to death. What a great talent."
5,"Delightful layers of learning abt Mexico, in a book/cd set","First, what the product details don't reveal is that Linda Ronstadt co-produced the cd of mariachi music included in the set - & ""Los Camperos de Nati Cano"" is a great mariachi band, lively and dignified with beautiful voices harmoniously arranged, absolutely none of the cloying attitude that some mariachis affect. The song list is great for learning about Mexican regional music, and the lovely little illustrated cookbook complements it perfectly, with lots of non-stereotypical and definitely ""exquisito"" recipes, menu ideas, and background on the delicious elements of Mexican cuisine. I can imagine a family who's learning Spanish, or planning to travel to Mexico, getting much more than their money's worth out of this great resource -- and any teacher of Hispanic students wanting to buy more than one set."
1,even worse than Earth X!,"I was hoping that this volume would clear up some of the pile of questions I was left with by the end of Earth X, but no such luck. Just awful storytelling and (at best) dreary art. By the time the Micronauts(!) made their appearance I had already decided to give up. There may be a story in there somewhere, but it's not worth the slog. Can we have negative stars?"
2,Yeesh.,"I enjoyed the earlier volume, ""Earth X,"" which was written by the same author... It was dense, but rewarding. This book, however, is just dense, almost unreadably so. Kreuger seems to be trying to cram every last little bit of the Marvel Universe in that he can, and the story is soooooooper gab-gab-gabby, overblown and kind of not that interesting. It's a haphazard tack-on to a very interesting earlier effort. Plus, the artwork (by a variety of contributors) is mostly really terrible, and looks quite slapdash... I'm a fairly devoted Marvel fan and I painfully slogged through this book, but you might want to think twice before you do.PS - I'm also not fond of the future-Captain America being portrayed in the likeness of the bald Bruce Willis. Gimme a break. (Axton)"
2,Bad Sequel,What I love the most on Earth X was that I don't need to be a Marvel Comics fan to undertand it. You go from character to character knowing them and understanding their part on the story so everything turns out to be enjoyable fantastic.This is not the case with Universe X part 1. I found this first half very difficult to read because of the inclusion of several non-popular characters and realms and past stories that make it dificul to understand. There is also some cosmic talk and Multiverses (mind you DC) and Microverses and different realities that takes the love and meaning away from the original saga.I just end up this one to continue with Universe X part 2. I hope at the end this whole purchase pay off.
2,Did not get to the point,"I was extremely disppointed by both the CD and the DVD. The CD is Tony Robbins interviewing Dr. Steven Covey. If I had wanted to hear what Dr. Covey had to say I would have purchased one of his CDs. The description of the DVD states that it will ""help you uncover what truly brings joy and fulfillment in your work."" The only information that this DVD gives is that there are three kinds of people, the talent, the investors and the sales people - figure out which one you are and then find the other two. Not a word about finding your gift. Since that was the subtitle I expected SOME information on that."
2,Not happy with the description of item did not hold true,I was not happy with the description of item. The items we purchased has a false description. Would not purchase ever again.Barb
3,Well...,"Of the three 1990s Band releases, this is widely regarded as the weakest...but it's not without its pleasures (Back to Memphis, Free Your Mind, Rick Danko on Where I Should Always Be and Richard Manuel's She Knows). If you have the classic Band albums from 1968-1976 and want to give their 90s albums a try, I recommend starting with Jericho or Jubilation. But if you have everything except this album, I'd say it's still worth picking up...as has been said many times before, even the worst of the Band is better than most groups at their best."
3,Robbie deserves better,"I too was astounded to read Mr. Himes' comments on Robbie Robertson's first two solo albums...the first one has several fantastic songs and Storyville is truly a classic...i played it for three months straight and the songs would not leave my head....Any reviewer who would make such a comment really is not worth reading any more....it is simply ridiculous....and by the way, I love the Band and will always love them....before and after Robbie Robertson left...but let's at least be fair...."
2,Fell apart within 1 week of school,"I bought the Mead Grad Recycled 5 subject notebook from Office Max or depot. The spiral wire binding doesn't hold the notebook together. Maybe it works for fewer pages/subjects, but it must have over 100 pages of paper and within the first week of school the front and back covers have fallen off and about 20 pages are about 1/2 way on. None of them have torn, the binding system is just not holding them together.My second issue with this notebook is each subject does not have a file sleeve in the yellow separator. Not sure if that makes sense, but the first yellow separator has a little file sleeve that holds extra files, like my syllabus, but it's the only one. The other 4 subject separators don't have that file sleeve.On the positive side, none of the pages that have become exposed have torn. I hate when pages tear off if you just jostle them just slightly even."
1,dont buy if fan of 80s hair metal,"This 3 cd set is not worth the 2.99 that i paid for it. If you loved 80s hair metal like i did dont buy this. Most of the tracks are re-recordings that dont even sound like the original, the rest are live tracks that, lets just say as much as i loved the music most were not that great live compared to the studio release. I bought this hoping to relive the glory days of the music i loved growing up and was very disappointed. I would recommend looking for a different compilation if you want to hear the original recordings of the 80s metal you love. Also goes for the second 3 disc set more this is 80s hair metal is even worse"
1,The Big Hair 80's from VH1 is MUCH better!!!!!!!!!,"Don't let the cover and the numerous bands fool you!!!!This is a VERY INCOMPLETE collection of Metal Hair bands.Buy the VH1 Big Hair version instead! maybe is a single cd, but it has the best Hair bands and some of their greatest hits like:* Quiet Riot- Cum on Feel the Noize* Poison- Talk Dirty to Me* Ratts- Round and Round* Whitesnake- Here I go Again* Scorpions- Rock you Like Hurricane* Warrant- Cherry Pie* Cinderella- Last mile* We're not Gonna Take It- Twisted SisterAND MORE!!!So don't waste your money on this BIG expensive and incomplete collection and buy the cheapest, single and BEST collection so far of 80's Hair Metal ""VH1 Big Hair: The Big 80's""Adios."
2,???????????????????,"what the he** is this? this so called 80's hair metal cd is missing half the famous bands from the 80's like motley crue, poison, iron maiden, black sabbath, and twisted sister, i have to give this cd 2 stars because the only thing that stopped from giving it a 1 is the quiet riot song and cherry pie. if you want some advice you should save your money."
5,Bilingual Tool,"This is a dictionary you never outgrow. Often used in high school, it continues to companion for life because of the familiarity from when the language was first learned. It is more than a dictionary, a lot of simple grammar in included. Just by brosing through the book, one can constantly learn new words. Comes handy for travel, too."
4,Garmin StreetPilot 2730,"If you buy this like I did, plan on the expense of map downloading and replacing the power source in about one year."
4,Works Great - Tons of Fun,"I travel a lot with my job and usually have multiple destinations to hit along the way. The GPS has worked wonders, I don't know what I would have done without it. It is very accurate and very easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone who travels or makes deliveries or just wants to keep from getting lost!"
4,cassio,Good product recieved very quickly......Short return time of only 7 days....Would have liked a little more time to see if it worked right......
2,"good, but some faults","good GPS. You never lose your way with this.However,Map data is so old (more than 3 years old?)that you can not find it such as the closest WAL-MART.It is very hard to activate the XM-traffic service.I tried to call XM-radio customer service, but gave it up because had to wait for long time."
3,Highly Overrated,"Here are a few things that may not be immediately noticeable until one actually buys the device: 1) the device does not have internal battery, i.e. it needs to be continuously plugged in; 2) the voice comes not from the device but from a little speaker located on the electrical plug, i.e. the sound comes from where your cigarette lighter is; 3) the device is heavy; 4) unless you're lucky and can install it really close to your face (as in the case of windshield-based devices), you'll have a real problem seeing the map; 5) the XM radio antenna is external and you will have to put this rather heavy dongle on your dashboard.Except for the possibility of having real-time traffic reports (which I have not tested), Nuvi 350 is a better choice."
4,Garmin 2730 GPS,"Good combination of thurough map coverage and XM radio to boot. Audible of street names is handy and humorous at times given local pronunciations! The first trip with the unit, it took us to the corporate offices for the amusement park we were to visit - the park is not in the database (we ran into a Garmin employee on that trip who submitted a database input/change and prompted me on how to do it in the future).Every vehicle should get a GPS. I imagine they will in the future."
2,stranded without power,GPS is awesome Power cord sucks...i am on my third power cord and they are $45 bucks each. the other pain is that the speaker is in the power cord so if you want to plus it in your center storage area you can hear it. other then that it is pretty nice!!!
2,no,I thought this was very bulky with too many wires. It took very long for the Garmin 2730 to find my location. I returned it and exchanged it for the Nuvi 350.
4,Garmin 2730,Unit worgs great the gps updates quickly and is is an ease to useThe only problem that i see is the power cord does not lock in securelyand by rotating the unit in pulls out easily
5,Made Me Remember My Childhood,"My gums got a bit dried out like her bucked-toothed character while reading about her antics. What a nice way to spend a few minutes every night, reading this little chapbook of sorts. It made me remember all the funny episodes you forget about your own childhood, all the vivid detail and vinegar. Makes me also want to have lunch with Miss Mann to get a good side ache. Hope she writes another!"
1,Underimpressed,"After reading all of the ""rave"" reviews from other readers, I must say I couldn't wait to read this book. I read it in one sitting, and I waited for the ""laugh outloud"" moments, I was ready to giggle. I was only slightly amused. I am from the South and love stories about growing up in the South. We all have our wonderfully eccentric family members that we love to talk about, but I was totally unimpressed with this writer's ability to engage me in the story. It was NOT even close to entertaining."
5,silent hill 4 strategy guide,"I recieved the item, quickly and well packaged...The item was in overgood condition as claimed by the description...I was very satisfied...thanks again"
4,Silent Hill 4 Strategy Guide Review,"I found this guide to be very helpfull. I was stuck on several parts, and this guide helped me through. If you need help with this game, get this guide!"
4,this dvd grows on you,"When I first ordered this dvd from amazon.com I thought boy what a lousy dvd only 30 minutes and I was not very impressed. I just put it to the side for a while. I watched it again a few more months of lessons and started to understand some of what tony smith was talking about. Now I think that this is an outstanding dvd smith covers dynamics, slap, does different grooves demonstrating them with the band and a nice cuban groove on the bass at the end. This is a gem and really for more experienced players very good I give it four stars just because of the length."
4,Great Bass Instruction,Good instructional DVD on setting up and keeping solid Bass grooves. Tony smith does a great job of outlining the important aspects and approaches to different techniques.
5,Recommended regardless of religious affiliation,"The author, Mary Baker Eddy, was far ahead of her time both in what she understood about God and mankind, and what she accomplished as a woman over 100 years ago. Other authors have attempted to discuss such ideas as what is real, what is illusion, what is God, Life, Truth, evil, good, health, etc. but have fallen short in the consistancy of their reasoning and conclusions. This book does require a great deal of work from the reader in order to put into practice what is discussed. The author explains the Bible in a way that makes it meaningful in dealing with today's challenges. I find no contradictions here, only inspired thinking. I have actually had healings as a result of reading this book, and I recommend it to others regardless of religious affiliation."
5,This book is for any and everyone!,"""To those leaning on the sustaining infinite, today is big with blessings."" with those words from Science and Health my life has changed. This book is for any and everyone! If you want to live a happier more successful life, read this book"
5,This book changed how I thought about life...,"I read Science & Health cover to cover about 5 years ago. It gave me a concept of God as love, as light, as truth. It opened up The Bible for me in new ways and made Jesus' teachings practical in my daily life. At the time I read the book, I was in a deep depression and suicidal.....the concepts in the book brought me back to center. I now live a happy, joyfilled life -- and the thoughts expressed in Science and Health are the reason for that. For serious thinkers who care about issues of spirituality........this is a must read."
5,It opened up the Bible to me like never before,"When I first read this book it made many of the opaque aspects of the Bible clear, inspired and with re-reading it continues to reveal more meaning to me about the Bible and being. It has comforted me many a time and once I lent an only copy to a friend and she asked if she could have it! I had to tell her she would have to get her own. Now it goes with me, with my Bible, if ever I travel. It still inspires and has healed me of warts, flu, burns, accidents, financial problems and most importantly my relationship with my mother (who was healed of an awful leg injury). It's great stuff. Don't walk but run to get it! It is really real!"
5,It has answers to life's most difficult questions.,"I have found solutions to and healing of financial, physical, spiritual, and emotional problems and challenges in this wonderful book. Explores beautiful definitions of God and His creation while inviting self-exploration. Enjoyable to read. Not full of fluff, - it's very substantial. Find out for yourself how the ideas in this book can change your life"
1,don't follow this blindly,"A word of caution to those of you considering adopting this book and the beliefs it advocates-- be sure you keep your own faith in perspective. I have no problem with people choosing Christian Science as a religion and I certainly don't condemn anyone for their beliefs. I will just say that this book and that way of thinking can cause people to put off seeking help when they need it. Had it not been for these things, my mother would be alive today. Just be careful, readers."
1,Not good enough,"This is just some so-so instrumental versions of Keith's songs.It has a lot of fiddle/violin, and most of Keith's music doesn't really highlight fiddle.Don't know whose idea this was.Buy a few more copies of BE HERE and give them to your friends."
5,"""Just Impossible"" is ""Just Terrific""","Judith Lansdowne is the best Regency writer today. Her plots, characterizations, period accuracy are all top-notch and ""Just Impossible"" is no exception. Other reviews will give readers the plot outline; this review is to state appreciation for a literate author who nevers descends to melodrama or steamy sex scenes to gain (or keep) a reader. I read the first half of this book in a heart surgeon's office under trying circumstances. I'd saved it for that occasion knowing it would make the hours fly and it did just that. Lansdowne's ability to draw the reader into a book is unsurpassed and she has a knack for creating intriguing, likable characters. ""Just Impossible"" is a fine example of her skill. If you want a Regency to re-read and enjoy every time, buy one of Judith Lansdowne's books."
4,Good Fun,"Super Hits of the 70's, Volume 23 is an excellent collection made up of some fun songs. The album opens with two instrumentals, the goofy ""Hocus Pocus"" by Focus that has some strangle yodeling on it and the super creepy ""Tubular Bells"" by Mike Oldfield which served as the theme for The Exorcist. The Kiki Dee Band's ""I've Got The Music In Me"" shows off Ms. Dee's impressive pipes, Blue Swede do a credible cover of The Association's ""Never My Love"", Pure Prairie League's ""Amie"" is one of the best country-rock songs of all-time, The Sweet's ""Fox On The Run"" is a great glam-rocker, John Travolta scored a top ten hit with his easy moving ""Let Her In"", Yvonne Elliman's pre-Saturday Night Fever ""Love Me"" is a nice surprise and Billy Ocean's first hit in America ""Love Really Hurts Without You"" doesn't really show the catchiness of 80's hits."
2,"One of the worst ""must have"" albums in existence","The entire ""Have a Nice Day"" series is comprised essentially of one hit wonders. With the butcher job done on ""Amie"", this disc is a one-hit wonder as well, but what a one. The hair-raising, eerie sounds of Mike Oldfield's ""Tubular Bells"" (theme from The Exorcist) have never been duplicated, and that one cut makes this disc worth having. Yvonne Elliman's ""Love Me"" adds a little support, but that's about it.Rhino was definitely on the downhill slope with Volume 23, but it's still a decent value and worth the purchase price."
5,Don't Worry About Orange Color,"Rolled up in indoor light, it looks orange.Unrolled in the sun, it looks yellow.I think because the tape is extremely thin and transparent, they had to add a little orange to prevent it from being washed out in the sun."
3,Thin,"I'm a little disappointed at how thin it is, I had some other caution tape that was a lot more opaque, this is pretty see through. It will still work though and is fine other then that."
4,Mintcraft 16000 Caution Tape,The product is exactly as advertised. Our crew finds it works as well as a product purchased locally but costs around $0.75/roll less when freight is added.
5,good story and great concept,"Cat planet cuties is one of those good shows that you wish there was a second season to continue the fun. Plus, I wish I had an assist droid like is seen in the show."
5,"Not just a ""Boobs And Butt"" show after all!","Ok, up front, this show has a quite a bit of nudity of super hot women. But it actually has a deep plotline, beautiful special effects, excellent artwork throughout the entire series, and excellent audio quality, and a LOT of humor, unforgettable characters (such as the crazy uncle I can't laugh hard enough about), alot of which is sexual in nature but only enough to make you smirk.Cat Planet Cuties is a MUST is you want some high quality anime with smoking hot women! Dead GOD, if all women looked like this our Earth population would be 20,000,000,000,000 by now! Get my drift?"
5,Lot of fun,"I had never heard of this anime and just kinda bought it for no reason....but i'm really glad i did cause it was really funny and even had cameos from luke, cecily and lisa (sacred blacksmith)and some characters from kampfer....the characters are fun and the story is well written...i never felt like there was a rush...all in all its definitely worth the money"
4,Good for a comedy mixed with a little action,"I thought this series was good but I wish that boy Kio Kakazu wouldn't just let that girl Manami Kinjou, physically bully him around. He's too nice of a guy, it's no wonder she thinks she can just walk all over him.Towards the end, Kio got three girls at the same time, but I wish Manami wasn't one of them."
3,NOT WORTH 40.00,its a good anime but the boxset is BS not worth 40.00 atal its total of 4 blu ray discs but 2 discs are i guess backups? 12 episodes on 2 disc with a OVA the other 2 disc are excatly the same no diffrence al 4 disc are bly ray so the second box of 2 blu rays is pointless. 12 eps with 1 OVA not worth it!
3,Good Book,I bought this book for my daughter who is 11. She had to read a biography for a book report. She really enjoyed this book and it was written well but in a voice that is child friendly. All in all it was a good book.
3,Interesting,"I was thoroughly surprised when the movie started to see Rahelio on the screen. I spent a day with Rahelio in Sedona about 10 years ago. He is a wise 'Spiritual Warrior' with lot's of wisdom to share. I found the movie subject matter very interesting. I felt the filming (quality of filmography, production etc. )of it was unfortunately amature. The artist & his father, Rahelio and his son had much to offer. Interesting, the same evening, prior to watching it I watched ""Vincent"" by Paul Cox filmmaker ( a profound documentary and exploration about the life and death of Vincent Van Gogh, a passionate tribute to the life, mind, and art of a man with extraordinary talent and humanity). The contrast in the style of filmmaking was huge. Sorry to say it made this one look more amature. I would love to see a powerful movie, with that high quality, made about Rahelio, incorporating the artist, the genius and others that he has touched. The Shaman still has volumns to share. www.rahelio.com"
5,Shifting Made Easy and Safe,This unit is great when you need to replace your shifter. Comes with everything you need for installation. Also is a safe shifter so you do not accidentally shift into reverse while rolling forward. Has cool look as well.
4,B&M Sport Shifter,"Nice item, fairly simple to install. Not saying there isn't a few difficulties involved, but it serves it's purpose. I should have gotten a shifter with a detent release, the lifting up on the handle to move the shift is a bit of a pain, tee handle would have been a better choice"
1,I thought I reviewed this already but here goes again.,"I would not recommend this product. shifting is not precise. chrome plate below the boot is plastic (which is not in the description). Although I do like B&M products, I would not purchase this item again. I will be upgrading to a better shifter real soon and just eating the cost of this one. I only gave this a one star because it would not let me leave it at zero stars."
2,If I wasn't a total fanboy my god,"This book fails to capture any of the magic that is Hellboy. Gone are the small illustrations by Mignola, which I wouldn't think would be a big deal..wrong. My first major complaint is the humor, it's horrible, Hodge tries too hard to slip some of the wit into the story that has been seen in the past two novels. No epic battles Hellboy manages to get in a fight with a Leviathan and do absolutely no damage, not like him at all. The story itself about the Vatican and avenging angels shows a lot of promise but sadly Brian Hodge can't pull it off. The beginning you start to see a glimpse of good stort but the rest of the book seems rushed. Passing Hellboy fans DO NOT make this the first HB novel you read. Bones of Giants is amazing, and The Lost Army isn't bad by any stretch. C-"
4,Excellent book,"I liked The Lost Army a lot, but the 3 last books have been deceptions for me. So this one took me by surprise!Brian Hodge manages to bring in what works really well with Mike's comics: the mood and the humor. But he also brings something that's sadly missing from Hellboy's drawn stories: the sense of details. I mean when you have so many cool objects and characters and locations and monsters... it's a pity that the whole thing is gone in 2 or 3 little comic books, isn't it?At least with this book we get to dive in some of the characters' previous life and the result is that we start caring about them. And I don't get that a lot from the comic book...Then again what we DON'T have is Mike Mignola's beautiful artwork which is what made me buy the first comics back then. A cover is ok but some inside illustrations would have been better.In the end I have really enjoyed this book and will buy the next ones."
3,Not Assorted Colors,"I called the store to make sure that they would send me assorted colors, out of the 5 that I bought, I got only two different colors. Fast Shipping, Perfect condition, just not what I had asked for."
3,So so,"This book is about restored old farm houses in Japan. The focus is not on the technicality of architecture, but on the finished results. There are several pictures in the book. For some reason I don't find the pictures particularly inspiring. So don't use this book to get interior design ideas. The key part of the book is the pictures. The text is not very interesting because it is mostly focused on background data.You should also note that the book is a combined English Japanese edition. This means that you get both English and Japanese text.If you want a more social account of the Japanese house I would recommendThe Inner Harmony of the Japanese House."
3,Voices of our Time.,I found this DVD mediochre. It has far to much commentory. Apart from that the singing of Ann Sophie von Otter is as per usual excellent.
4,TOP NOTCH WESTERN,"With over one million Ralph Compton books in print these Western tales have become a phenomenon. Fans of Zane Grey and Louis L'Amour will find both entertainment and excitement in these sagas, especially when performed by the gifted Terry Evans.Buck Fletcher is doing time - 20 years for a murder he didn't commit. However, he's needed on the outside, badly needed by Senator Falcon Stark. Not many men have Buck's reputation or gunfighting ability. Senator Stark believes Buck's just the man, the only man to go into Arizona Territory and find the Senator's daughter, Estelle.It's great to be out of jail but little did Buck know he'd have to face a band of killer Apaches as well as a psychopath in his efforts to bring Estelle home.- Gail Cooke"
2,Just your average everyday western,"Hero has to kill or be killed by either whites or Apaches. He can't tell friend or foe, but he has to rescue the girl. That is about it. I didn't really enjoy this book."
4,Funny and Surprising Good vs Evil,I had no idea where this story was headed and was pleasantly surprised by the ending. I enjoy books that mix historical figures into the action. My only complaint is that some of it seemed a little too California for me and I felt I was missing some of the cultural or landmark references.
5,Catchy Italian songs,"My kids love to listen to this CD, and also to sing the songs on their own. I often find children's music annoyingly saccharine, but I can happily listen to these songs over and over. Like the songs on the first volume (which is also great), these have easy, memorable lyrics that help kids remember Italian vocabulary."
5,Marble Mortar and Pestle,"Bought for an excellent cook in the family. She loved it and said it will work so well for mixing all the spices she uses with her recipes. It was a heavy, smooth marble and was very attractive. I recommend this one over many of the plastic type ones. Really nice..."
3,Good,"This is a pretty good autobiography. Leigh comes off as a lovely lady--someone you would want as a friend. The times she recounts with Tony Curtis are really sweet -- it seems like she was deeply in love with him. I felt that the book didn't go into enough detail about her films and it ended rather abruptly after her marriage with Curtis fizzled. Would like to hear more about what the later years were like raising the girls with new husband Bob. But still, I enjoyed it."
5,What A Lovely Lady,"Janet Leigh is the epitome of a genuine, down-to-earth nice person. It is very interesting reading about her humble beginnings in Hollywood, her eventual success and marriage to Tony Curtis. Ms. Leigh is such a sweet person and it's a shame she still isn't around. They don't make them like that anymore. I think if you have an interest in Ms. Leigh at all, you will enjoy this book. Worth the read!"
1,A Rip-off,This 20-25 minute video is a waste of money. There is very little meat on house construction or design. It is basically a few shots of nicely constructed houses and a short interview.
4,Awesome carabiner!,"This item came quickly and is a great carabiner! It's very large and can hold a lot of weight. It's in wonderful condition. I must say, I'm very happy with this purchase. Pretty cheap for a decent carabiner, too! Thanks!"
2,look close,"When I ordered this pendant, I did not see the small football like grooves in it. It looks very weird in person. I went back to the picture and see it now. It totally distracts from the volleyball. Also, it tends to turn around a lot and since it is hollow you often find yourself looking at the inside of it - not too pretty!"
5,The most enlightening book I have ever read.,"Adelle Davis books are amazing. I learned so much and they helped me and my family to an incredible degree. I still, 20 years later constantly refer to them. But some things have changed since she wrote them. Not that she was inaccurate, but times have changed - ie. liver now has pesticides concentrated in it so is no longer a superfood. Due to this, Dr Atkins new vitamin/health books are similar to hers but more updated. Hers are somewhat more detailed than his though, so I still find myself referring back to hers on several occasions. Her basic information is sound and true and I have years of using and testing them to base that on. I am including my email address in case anyone wants more detailed information. If you have beliefs in orthomolecular medicine, this book is a ""must have"". In my family it is an ""heirloom"" and will be passed down generationally."
3,Let's Eat Right To Keep Fit,"I have only read a few pages so far. I am assuming the content will fasdcinate me. In a book I've recently completed,this book and author was referenced. ""Adele"" had a huge impact on them in their endeavors to grow,eat and sell only organic meat and vegetables."
4,Excellent Morcheeba album,"She does it again with some awesome trip-hop lounge beats. If you liked Big Calm and Who Can You Trust, you're sure to like this one. Beats and B-sides is the only one that I think doesn't compare to the typical Morcheeba (that I like)."
3,"Good, semi-return to form","After Fragments of Freedom, they probably realized they weren't very good pop songwriters. So, here we have a sort of return to form. There is definitely some pop flavored material here but not as all out blatantly as FoF. And besides, the material is strong enough to hold up. Two appearnces from Pacewon was unnecessary but thankfully they are brief and the Slick Rick appearance more than makes up for Pacewon's mediocrity. Good record, but not great. I'm still waiting for Big Calm II."
3,A good attempt. Should have been an EP.,"Overall I'm not disappointed in this CD. I bought it back in August of 02 and put it aside to listen to the Vines and White Stripes. I have to say, this cd has grown on me, I'm skipping less tracks and it has found a place in my car. ""way beyond"" is my favorite song on the cd. It has a smooth lounge kinda vibe to it and Skye's voice is as soothing and placid as ever. Great Cd if you are already a fan, if not start with Big Calm."
2,Really BORING!,"I don't recommend this album to you. In fact, i wish i'd buy another album than waiste my money on it. The album is poor and boring, and there are no really good tracks... the only one that was somehow decent was their single, i forgot it's name..But really... pretty [bad]..."
1,make it stop!,"My coworker loves to slap this disc on from time to time and I have to say - it makes me want to jump out a window. What is it with this band? Every 'melody' is cloying and sing-songy, really irritating stuff. Complete pap. I'm a musician, I understand MELODY, complex melody, song structure, etc - i think this band smokes too much mary j to get down to serious songwriting. Same verse-chorus-verse garbage, silly lyrics, brainless chorus. Aaarrrrrgh! Please stop making records!"
1,This CD is in poor taste,"He is going to have to kill his woman because she won't lose weight?Who wants to hear such a shallow, self-centered person sing that?Time to bypass this album, and find something else.Bob"
1,Do we even care anymore?,"I don't care how nice a voice he has...This is not cute. IT's not funny. It's just plain stupid. This encourages that same attitude that a woman's value is all about her appearance - and it better be only one acceptable appearence. I will not approve of anything that says that unless you torture yourself into a body that more resembles a half starved boy than a fully figured woman, then your husband should leave you. ESPECIALLY considering that this is the mother of his children - in the song - it SAYS she had two children and he is complaining because she doesn't look like a 14 yr old anymore. This constant encouragement to devalue women as three dimensional people is simply wrong - particularly when the ideal encouraged more resembles pedophilia or encourages eating or mental disorders."
2,Weak,"I've been a Morcheeba fan since their fisrt album, Who can you trust?. They kept the quality in Big Calm but have gotten increasingly commercial, soft and boring since then. There are much better albums out there to chill out to than this one. They've lost everything that made them special. Only in songs like Sao Paolo they come close to sounding like the band they once were. Sad."
2,YOU WILL BE DESAPOINTED ! ! !,"If, like me, you liked ""Who can u trust ?"" and ""Big calm"", and you're expecting something as good as those two CDs, you will be very desappointed. I was waiting ""Charango"", hoping that I could listen a good TRIP-HOP album from the group who made me fly with their two first CDs but... Where is the real inspiration ??? ""Charango"" is only a common POP album without any originality. I really have the impression that they recorded that album only to make money... What a shame ...FORGET IT ... There are so many good CDs you have to buy before that one ..."
2,"We've heard it before, and better","I was very excited to get this CD, having basically worn out Big Calm and Who Can You Trust?, and having seen them perform live. Unfortunately, I was bored by what I heard. They are playing the same style, but this time around it feels sleepier, not as intriguing, and not as fresh. Looks like they were a 2-hit wonder, unfortunately."
3,Nice little gadget,"I would have rated it 5 stars if it can do a little bit more. But for the price, this is what we will get. Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros:1. Get audio, video and photo players for as little as $100.2. The quality of playback is good.3. Small speaker that is good.Cons:1. Bad document.2. Cannot convert video files other than AVI even though they say it can do.4. Cannot create play list.5. Can display just 8 characters of songs.Some of the customers have mentioned here that they cannot use the convertor software without connecting the PVR. What I found is if the PVR is not connected, it will display an error message. If we press OK, it will say that the media will be stored in a temporary directory which we can download it later.Another thing is only for video we need the convertor software for audio and photos we can directly copy using the disk drive mode. I usually copy to the SD card directly using my card reader which I found is much faster."
2,Design Flaw,"Like mentioned in another review, this doesn't work with a Mac...but I have work-arounds so I can deal with it. There are two REAL issues about the PVR-A1 to me: physical design flaws and output. Everything on the PVR-A1 is so nicely made and then there is the select/scroll/volume knob. After lugging this device around the switch got hit a couple of times and *BAM* it either doesn't work at all or it is always switched on and moving the selector at random...not to mention not being able to control volume. This is the weakest hardware link of the whole thing. Second, there isn't any video output, so if you do record anything you can't play it out...unless you use their hokey software converter, but then you still can't hook this up to a TV and play anything. After saying all of this. You get what you pay for and I got this cheap. Better to buy a real, full-featured PVR like a Tivo or MacTV if you want video."
2,Stopped working,"I purchased this for my son, he loved it. We didn't use it often, just when we traveled. We had it 1 year and 1 month when it died. The screen wouldn't come on anymore,however the buttons lit up,but then it would not power off, we had to remove the battery. If I had known this item would not have a long life, I would have spent a little more and got a better device."
2,just ok,"I bought this mostly for the video playback. The conversion program does a TERRIBLE job of converting videos to the format the player can play...it is choppy and with lots of pixelation...At first I thought something was wrong with the device, but then I recorded a show from TV directly with the device and it had really good quality...so I know now the conversion software is the problem. It really sucks! I tried converting using software I normally use to create ASF files, but it won't play anything unless it is converted by its own conversion program. Even though the price is good, pass on this one...Oh and another thing...I also have a Mustek Camera/camcorder which records video as ASF files, but this Mustek player won't play the videos recorded by the Mustek camera! That's really sad...doesn't say much for this company."
2,Not so hot,"I'm not too keen on this player...Aside from cheap construction, flimsy battery cover, and poor documentation there are major technical drawbacks: mp3 filenames are trimmed and (worst of all) video must be in .ASF format.I had a hard time figuring out why the unit's resolution wasn't mentioned in any of the information I had seen online until I realized that all video you want to transfer to the device has to pass through Mustek's conversion software, which (a) not only takes a painfully long time to transfer video (almost 30 minutes for a 30 minute 80MB DIVX) but (b) doesn't allow you to specify any settings other than ""low"" or ""high"" quality."
5,Jesus-filled Reggae!,"An annointed work, beautiful and full of Christ - it's just NOT watered down. The lyrics are honest and full of scripture, I can highly recommend it. It's definitely an album that grows on you, take the time to hear it out!Be sure the enemy of the cross will speak out against this blessing, after reading the first ""comment"" for this album I had to post up my thoughts."
1,Expiration Date,"Expiration date for these batteries is 2010, it's March 2010. Really? You can't send newer batteries? Even if I do use them right away I should sent newer batteries. I wouldn't buy from this seller again."
1,Worst Batteries Used In A LONG Time,"Purchased from Eskimo Wholesale (I will post their response when received, as I sending them this comment too) - I should have been a bit cautious when I received 2 Two-Packs, rather than a single Four-Pack . . . I should have returned them the instant I noticed they were labeled for sale in Brazil only (I only kept them because they were well within the use by date, and, sadly, I did not notice the ""Brazil only"" comment before I had already opened them). These are rated as specially made for Digital use, so instead of using them, as I had intended when ordering them, in a Carbon Monoxide detector, I gave them to my wife for our Digital Camera. Each pair lasted no more than six pictures each, with an overall run-time of >maybe< 10 minutes a pair or so. Truly rotten batteries, I am very sad to say."
2,"Average Battery, wouldn't pay extra for these.",I bought these on accident when I was trying to buy some rechargeable batteries for my camera. But for the money I paid I thought they would last longer than the average battery but they didn't.
5,Perfect,I have to have this exact notebook for school. It is big enough for me to glue standard paper into. Easy to tear out. Only problem is it takes up a lot of room in my binder. You can get it less expensive too.
5,Does the job well.,A functional and basic notebook that does the job and kept me from having to wait in the long Staples lines.
4,PLEASE HELP,"I haven't heard the cd yet. I'm actually looking for a cd by a group named Today. Their album was self titled, Today. They came out in 1987,I think, and from what I understand they aren't in distribution any longer. I'm looking for the cd so if you can help, please let me now."
4,Today,"Just as many other music fans, I am looking for the CD by the group Today. The CD is self-titled, ""Today"". Just as others, I have not been able to find this CD. I as well as others would purchase this CD instantly if it was available. Anyone's assistance is appreciated."
4,I almost feel Like a LIberal!,"Great cd. When I listen to it, I want to break out the white wine and cheese. But then, I realize Im a conservative and I quickly recover myself and turn on Limbaugh."
5,I love this show!!,I watched this show religiously when I was young.. My only complaint about this product is that they should have made the seasons longer than they did..
2,Wrong Part,This is listed for 2005 and earlier FXDWG Wide Glides. It is not the correct part so I returned it. Looks like it is for Dyna's without the bobtail fender.
5,Wow!,I was surprised by the weight and sturdiness of this stand. My tuba fits on it perfectly because its adjustable and it also looks cool. I love it.
4,Amazing set!,"This chess set is so beautiful! All the pieces are beautifully made! They actually look like the real thing! It also comes with a very nice board (with the Lord of the Rings theme, of course) and it seems very good quality. I have been looking for a nice Lord of the Rings chess set and I fell in love with this one! The Return of the King is my favorite out of all the Lord of the Rings films."
5,YOU MUST BUY THIS CD IF U ARE AN OZ FAN,"Our local Drama group is performing the ""Wizard of Oz (RSC)"" for our summer production and as Musical Director I thought I'd get as many different versions of each song as possible. Most of the RSC songs do not appear in the film version so i thought i'd add this cd to my collection. All the songs have been modernised without loseing their still traditional feel. The cd is worth buying alone for Roger Daltreys' (The Who) version of ""If I Only had a Heart"". All star cast inc Natalie cole (miss you like crazy and pink cadillac) and Nathan Lane ( voice of ""snowbell"" in Stuart Little) and a load more older names that your parents will recognise more.a must buy"
2,Meh,"They tried to do their own take on some of the songs plus some of singers just DID NOT fit. It worked very well for some of the songs like for Nathan Lane as The Cowardly Lion ( when he wasn't forcing jokes into the songs, yuck! ) and the Munchkins but some of the songs like Scarecrow and Tinman they changed up to the point that they were almost completely different and not very good. Jackson Browne made for a depressing Scarecrow IMO. And I REALLY wish they rerecorded it the audience and the acoustics do not make for a good album.BUT I will say this, it is worth a listening to. The previews available should give you a good idea what your in for and if you don't mind the flaws you'll most likely enjoy the album."
3,You Decide....,"I got this CD because I love ""The Wizard of Oz"". When I actually listened to it, it was pretty good (3 stars), but then again nothing can compare with the 1939 MGM classic. Be prepared though, this isn't exactly the same as the 1939 movie. It has Jewel singing ""Over The Rainbow"" and the first couple of times that you listen to it, you might say ""what made me get this??"" Once you get over that though, it is pretty good. By the way, they have this on video, if you didn't get to see it on VH1. (with LOTS of commercials)"
4,A TRIP OVER THE RAINBOW WORTH TAKING!,"This is a must-have addition for all true fans of ""The Wizard of Oz"". Nathan Lane and Roger Daltrey's performances just blow you away! The biggest mistake was casting Jewel as Dorothy, as her voice range (or lack of) desecrates ""Over the Rainbow"". Sam Harris would have played the role better! Debra Winger's adlibs in an attempt to update the storyline are annoying and weak at best. Still, you will find yourself singing along to this updated classic. Enjoy it for what it is - a new twist to an old friend!"
4,Could have been better,"I think the major stars on this, Jewel, Debra Winger, Natalie Cole and Jackson Brown, are fabulous. I was really disapointed in the Harlem Boys Choir. They do hit some great notes, but then the great notes are followed by some really flat ones. I've heard them in other recordings and thought they were great, but they are not at their top on this CD. But if you are a 'Wizard of Oz' fan, the rest of the CD makes up for them."
1,Dreck,"Wow, this is abysmal. Jewel is grating, with that ...show-bizzy voice usually reserved for ""talented"" 12 year olds. Browne,Cole could NOT be stiffer and Winger's ad libs are real sloppy. Daltrey, bless his heart tries and Lane is his usual competent, hammy self. A must to avoid. This is as bad as the Original film is good. However, the proceeds do go to a good cause. Buy it and throw it away if you have money to burn, that's my advice."
2,WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!,"This is probably one of the worst recordings I've heard of The Wizard of Oz. The cast is horrible. Jewel shouldn't have been cast as Dorothy. Though her voice is pretty, it wasn't right for the part. The way she sang ""Over the Rainbow"" was horrible and annoying unlike Judy Garland who sang it beautifully. The rest of the cast sucked as well. If you get a recording of The Wizard of Oz get the one with Judy Garland in it. This one is waste of money and there is nothing good about it."
3,Deja-vu,"As a long time fan of Ras I was very excited to check his new album. After listening to the LP it seems that Ras is still stuck in his 2nd LP glitch. Meaning, this record sounds just like a modern day version of his softmore release. You still can expect solid production (even more variety then before) and great lyrics, just not anything mind-blowing. I expected to hear some concept material or thought-provoking songs, what I got was just a luke warm attempt. I set a bar for him awhile back, I know he's capable of making a CLASSIC record again I just hope next time around he can deliver. 3.5 stars! Peace"
4,Disco Diva benefits from remastering,"I agree with the previous reviewer that the original album was great and that this is almost the exact same CD with the exclusion of the ""Friends"" track. I guess it's a matter of taste, but in it's place is the song ""Paradise Found"" which was not included on the original album. I personally prefer this track over Friends but that's a moot point. I think the big difference here is the remastering job. I you prefer the lesser quality of the old album as compared to this newly remastered edition just because it has Friends on it, I have some advice for you. Pick up the new edition, the sound quality is much better and buy the single of ""Friends"" on Ebay. This CD has better sound, better artwork and is an overall improvement over the original greatest hits on Hot. Amii Stewart deserves an upgrade and this CD release does just that."
5,aah! Bisto,This gravy is easy to make and flavorful. So easy to add to stews or casseroles or just use as a simple gravy.
5,Ahhhhh Bisto,If you've never used Bisto before you don't know what you're missing. Moving from the UK we really missed this. Glad to find it on-line.
3,A flawed guide!,"When I bought this guide, I noticed how many typos, name errors, and wrong locations were in it (Ex. They list the Mana Bow as being in the DeArniese Hold, however, it is actually the Elven Court Bow.) Though this guide is correct in how to get thriough the game, bad editing, and spelling errors made it very confusing! I think it does make it easy to get through the game however, so I gave it a * * * rating"
3,"The ""not so"" Perfect Guide.","This book has nice walk-throughs and has helped me a lot when it came down to deciding which characters I wanted to play. I can't rate it any higher than 3 stars because this book has WAY too many misspellings. Somebody should have run a spell-checker on this thing! There are also some inconsistencies between this book and the BG2 manual-not to mention inconsistencies within the book itself. For example: On pg.12, when describing the advantages of the Monk class, it states ""10th level: The monk's fist is considered a +1 weapon (+2 at 16)."" Read a little further, ""15th level: Fists are treated as +3 weapons."" Discrepancies such as this force you to turn to the BG2 manual for the correct information. It would be nice to be able to rely on this guide alone. The Perfect Guide looks great, but is far from being perfect."
2,I Guess This'll Have To Do . . .,"I am just not fond of this guide. There's a breakdown of the classes, list of joinable NPCs, item list, spell list, cheats section and a walkthrough. But the Versus Books' opinions are littered throughout here, ex. they rate Edwin as a less-desirable NPC based on his personality rather than the fact he's quite useful w/ his 18 Int - I thought this was a STRATEGY guide, not People magazine. There are a few inaccuracies in the item list. It does actually have some tips for all the romances, one of the more obscure features of BG2. Since this is really the only widely-published BG2 guide, there's not much of a choice whether or not you should buy it if you get stuck."
4,One of the best PC Strategy Guides I've ever read......,"Normally, I despise strategy guides for PC games, mainly because I was once a Console-only player, before I got a computer, and found PC Strategy Guides too boring. I would hold something, normally the size of a phonebook in my hand, flip through it, and it was a chore to find what I wanted, not because they were disorganized(Well, most of them weren't), but because, frankly, I found them boring to read(The only exceptions to that were the three Strategy Guides for StarCraft and Brood War).I truly enjoy the Versus Strategy Guide for BG2 for one main reason; it's fun to read it. It's not a bore, or a hassle, but actual fun. Plus, they include things most strategy guides don't, like cheats, which is useful if you don't have a netlink.The main reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I found it lacking in some info(Like all small quests, which I would've enjoyed having), and some minor errors.I say you really can't go wrong with it."
4,Excellent Guide to an Excellent Game,"You can learn as little or as much as you want about this amazing game. you can get hints or all out spoilers through out the game, which is nice, because reading something that ruins the plot ruins the entire game.the books goes into extensive knowledge about most NPC's, items, and the different quest throughout the game. i give it 4 stars, because to me 5 stars is unattainable."
3,Imperfect Perfection,"Like the other reviewers here, I found this book to be less helpful than I would have liked. Very pretty, many nice charts, but flawed. Perhaps most annoying is the rah-rah adolescent writing style that sacrifices substance for style. MANY typos, which is inexcusable and tells you something about the quality that went into the text. There are many online strategy guides that are much better in content, thought maybe not in quantity. I mainly used this book for a quick-review type guide when I was playing the game and couldn't get to the information I had downloaded. The walkthrough section (which only covers the main quests) is very good and I liked have all the information about everything (spells, monsters, items etc.) in one place. Use this book as an introduction and a review, but if you really want to know the details about playing the game, go to the online sites and forums."
2,"Not quite better than nothing, but pretty pictures","Not very helpful in actually getting you through the game, since there are numerous errors and quite obvious typos (one that is repeated several times refers you to ""page ????"" - think they rushed into production and didn't quite finish editing). On the other hand, the full color illustrations are nice and there are a number of detailed maps, which unfortunately are not keyed to the numbered events in the text. The item list in the back is nice to have but also incomplete and with some errors.Since you're probably going to have to buy it used at this point and pay way more than the original price (I did, anyway), think about whether you want this just for the not-totally-complete maps and item lists. The text is juvenile and the plot line is incomplete, so don't buy it for that. There are wonderfully detailed guides free for the downloading available on line, so if you wants hints and walkthroughs, get one of them, not this."
2,nice pictures,"First off, this guide does give you a lot of detail about character class, items, quests, and monsters(though combat stradegy is a bit amaturishly written). The author is a rude charlaton for lack of a better word(Just getting into charater with the game) who doesn't know how to play the game. For one thing, as I said in another reivew of ToB's 'Perfect' guide, he is saying play the game his way, or else. Well, there are many ways to play SoA. When I wrote this guy about stats for characters he wrote back saying that my paladin with CHR at 18 ""was just plain stupid"" to put it in his words. I think not. CHR was not even the stat I was asking about. In my opinion 18 for a paladin, if anything else gives you fringe bennifits not found at 17, like higher rewards for quests ect. Anyway(s) he was rude and I'm blaming it on Versus. I think players can make desisions for themselves thank you. Clean up your act people!"
2,Has Info but Not detailed or helpful most of the time,"This guide looks like it was written by little kids in 8th grade. The inconsistencies with the game and the misinformation aggrevates. The Amulet of Missiles doesn't shoot magic missiles, it shoots the equivlent of a fireball. The guide is not worty of naming itself perfect. In the FAQ sections, they say it is rediculous to try and get every quest in. This to ammounts to laziness. Due to time and space constraints is thier excuse, well people will pay for a good guide not one that is kicked out incomplete and inaccurate. The typos on some pages mixed two quests into one from two different parts of the guide. The only good thing is that they did the guide on the right game."
1,ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!,Why ANYONE would want to ruin the playing with this book (and I use the term loosely) I don't know.
2,"Poor workmanship, Light Weight","This monopod arived (Not from Amazon)with a broken zipper tab, The foot hold down is very cheaply designed. The Mono pod itself had a decent ball head on it but was very light weight. The carrying bag is not bad except for the broken zipper tab that mine had. Spend a little more money and get a good brand that provide a more stable base."
2,It saves on typing and has examples.,"If you don't mind a lot more typing go to the SBA site and take the course on business plan writing. This system is not flexible enough and can be a hindrance when you are ""inventing"" your business."
2,Samples are old and not useful,I think this product is way over rated <If anyone knows of a good business plan that has a lot of marketing information and asks great questions etc...and up to date samples of business plans with details about strategy and marketing etc...please inform me < Thanks <
3,"Not bad, but no substitute for experience","I was trying to save a little time by using this software and I was a little disappointed. The sample business plans leave much to be desired. Still, its gives many examples of different types of businesses, which is ok if you are going into a business that is common (i.e. a retail store or food service). Just don't think you can create a business plan in a few hours that will attract investors.Good luck!"
5,Great tool for a new business owner!,"As a new business owner I found the Business Plan Pro the perfect tool to get started. It is extremely thorough and contained invaluable information, including a detailed expense check list that has helped me forcast and budget for every situation. For those of us who studied political science instead of business in college, Business Plan Pro's simple step-by-step process is truly appreciated. I would recommend this program to any new business owner, especially those who are going out on their own for the first time."
1,Bad Deal!!,"They did not send me a Activation code that comes with the program, so not I can't open it up. They just took my money!I e-mailed the sender and they never contact me back."
1,It is free and that is to much.,It may be free but its a waist of your time. It does nothing to help understand weather or forcasting.
5,Hard to find songs all in one place!,"My father-in-law asked me to transfer one of his homemade cassette mix tapes onto CD. Rather than trying to fix the quality of his scratchy old tape, I went to just make a copy from CD. Little did I know how hard it would be to find some of these songs in a digital format. This CD was a lifesaver because it had three of the songs I was looking for: Theme from Moulin Rouge, Anna (El N. Zumbon), and High Noon.This is a fabulous addition to the collection of the fans of 1950's movies!"
3,Practice makes perfect,"The work book requires a minium skill level of beginner. If you have some basic knowlege of the language, and some vocabulary you will find this book a great tool. I have sharpened my speed and usesage of verbs essential in conversational Italian. I would recommend it."
1,"If you don't subscribe to ancestry, this book is pointless","I had hoped that this book would help me locate treasures on the internet. Unfortunately it is, for the most part, a printed index to what is available on ancestry.com. If you don't subscribe to ancestry, don't waste time or money on this book."
3,A Decent Mystery,This novel has a little bit of everything...... a murder. a romance. a ghost. Druids. But I could only give it three stars because of all of the British slang. Most of these slang terms were unknown to me so at times I could only guess at what the character was saying. I found that very annoying.
4,Good but tiny,"There is no ctrl key on the right side, and the enter and shift keys are too small, so it is not a first choice as an everyday keyboard. But it is perfect for my Mac Mini G4 that I keep near my front door."
3,Not My Style,"Georges Simenon's ""The Venice Train"" is a character study rather than a conventional mystery. True there are crimes, but no actual detection.The characters are excellent; even the minor characters have personalities. The settings are great with ample but not superfluous description.If this were a motion picture, it would be a cult classic. Either you would love it or hate. I did not love it."
1,The disc is crap,This is without a doubt the worst video in my collection. The video is way out of proportion. Sometimes his hand is like a big meathook. Do not buy it.
1,"No power, noisy","Sure there's several attachments. But they are all small. Sure it spins. Until you press it against your skin. This item seriously lacks balls. I used it twice and returned it. I was ready to return it after the first use, but thought I would give it another chance. Well what I colossal waste of time and water. It took me three times as long to wash myself than with body wash and a poof. It washes such a small area at a time, and if you want to exfoliate, which is the reason for using this, you have to sit on a small area for a few seconds. And you can't press down on your skin, or it stops spinning. So to just have it lightly sit on your skin, that does nothing. Even to just use it on your back which is hard to reach, its still a waste of time."
2,"Nice idea, wish it was better!","I liked the whole concept untill I used it. wish it was ""stronger"" and came with larger extensions, sure they are great but you truely need more motor power if you want this product to deliver."
3,A reference rather than tutorial,"I bought this book in hope of learning NAnt as a newbie, since a good portion is for NAnt. However, after reading less than 10 pages in Chap. 4 Build Automation, I started looking for alternative. This book is for people who already have some experience on Nant, but certainly not for beginner."
3,"A great starter, but not a final answer.","This book has a great overview of available open source utilities. It is a good reference for developers with little start up capital.On the other hand, aside from nAnt, it lacked on the specifics of the how to use each of the tools."
3,Great Book,"Great book, but the souce code on the CD has a number of missing files, so I need to give a 3 stars, sorry. VERY poor QA on the published CD. I hope the author will post the missing files somewhere for readers to download."
1,"nice thought, but it didn't work.","the two french bread pans (i should have bought one first) really didn't work well for me. browning was inhibited on loaf bottoms at 425 degrees. no comparison to a black cookie sheet or a good hot pizza stone. i used 11 oz of dough per loaf and they seriously over rose compared to the profile of the pans (they looked like big long ice cream cones). they browned well on top but were white on bottom. loaf was forced to flow over the edge of the pans (even at 11 oz per loaf). i just can't think of a single advantage for these pans. well, possibly they would make good spetzel. sorry."
1,Fox Run Non-Stick 15-1/2-Inch French Bread Pan (Kitchen,"I should have read the reviews before buying. This pan is ok if you want to make bread sticks (two). This is not for the french breads you see at the stores, which is what I was after."
2,Nothing spl. about this book,"As the books name stands I was expecting to learn lot of new internals about CLR from this book. But this book is a total disappointment. All the book covers is .NET Framework class information and the title says this book is about CLR. Most of the information covered by this book is already available from others books and there is nothing new in this book and this book covers 2% about CLR.My recommendation is, if you want to know anything about CLR then this is not the book that you should read. If you want to learn anything about the .NET Framework classes, then this may be one of the books. But I'd suggest you to read the book ""VB.NET Core Classes in a Nutshell"" from O'Reilly."
4,Knoxx,I put this on my Mossy 500 Cuiser. Works great. My shoulder is a lot happier for it! A great tacticle add on.
4,Better than advertised,"I got this for my H&R; Pardner 12 gague which is clone to the Remington 870 shotgun, everything on both guns are interchangeable with each other except the barrels. The installation went smooth as silk, it took longer to take off the stock stock then to replace it. To me the SpecOps stock is a little more heavier than the stock one, it has three places to attach a sling to.Pros1. Tames felt recoil2. Adjustable to fit any user3. Gives your gun the wow effectCons1. Heavier than stock"
2,Did not fit,This stock will not properly seat on the mossberg frame. It is as if the screw is too large for the frame.
5,Big Improvement,"I thought it was a tad pricey when first ordering. Now that I've rec'd it, I couldn't be happier. The quality is excellent and there are two things I didn't realize.1) The dual recoil suppression built into the stock definitely supports a higher price target. There are two recoil springs in the stock. One is in the handle and it allows the action to slide back about a half-inch there over the handle. You can sorta tell from the picture where it would slide. The other is located in the stock itself and absorbs about another half-inch or so. So you get about an inch worth of spring action recoil reduction in addition to the gushy rubber pad on the stock itself.2) I was delighted to see the package also included a matching fore-end piece. The fore-end is pre-tapped for another pistol grip if you want to convert it to a two-handled tactical gun.Installation on my Rem 870 was simple (you can look at my customer images above)."
3,mixed feelings,"I don't use this tape any more, as I am now into yoga and pilates which give me as much stretching as i need - and more than this. However it has a lot to recommend it. the cueing is excellent, the moves are thorough, it leaves you pleasantly stretched out and kind of relaxed. I stress the kind of - I stopped using this tape because it started making me nervous. I don't know why Karen Voight made so many tapes with a bunch of participants hovering behind her. I can only see the point of having one other participant who is performing more or less advanced versions. This video - well, I can forgive cheesy sets and hairdos, but there is one participant who grins ALL THE TIME. She's a bit like the intermediate participant in All the Right Moves - it gets to the point where I can't do a tape any more because of the irritating fixed grin which makes me think of Stepford Wives. So if you are more zen then me, go for it. Otherwise - don't!"
2,There's no Tool Like an Old Tool,"I gave this DVD 2 stars and I was being generous because I'm a long-time Karen Voight fan. I've been a Personal Trainer for several years and am always looking for material to stay on the cutting edge. This DVD certainly wasn't current or very informative since it was produced so long ago. I read the other reviews prior to purchasing this one and should have been warned, but I remember Karen Voight's work to be of a higher caliber than most so I gave it a try. Don't make the same mistake I have! This DVD should be put away with your pink leg warmers and matching scrunchies."
3,Pure and Simple is the perfect description,"This routine lives up to its title - Pure and Simple. I found this a bit too basic (and boring) even for a beginner. She has a better strecth routine in later offerings. I returned this DVD, and now I'm looking for something a little more challenging - something that makes you feel like you've stretched and exercized when done."
2,too slow moving,"I wanted a basic stretch routine... but this program is way too slow moving for me. Found myself getting bored very quickly. Also, this IS very outdated. Might be ok for someone who wants to meditate while stretching, but it's not for me. I will return this one....."
1,Just fair,"I was expecting alittle more from Karen because her workouts are great. But I guess it's just stretching, pure and simple!! Okay for older folks..."
1,The most boring video I've ever seen,"I've seen Karen Voight on television and really liked her. But this video bummed me out! I know stretching is supposed to be relaxing, but this video is like being coached by an undertaker! Voight is sluggish, lacks any form of enthusiasm, and even her lackeys in the background look somber. I don't want pig-tails and pompons, but could we get a little spark of life here, Karen?"
5,Very Good / Would buy again,This unit was easy to put together and easy to use.I keep up with my 20 Minutes use every 3 days. Would buy again.
3,bowflex,Product good. However the shipping leaves somewhat to be desired. This was ordered as a christmas gift. I received it 2 days after christmas. I had to initiate the calls to find out where the product was. Amazon subcontracted the delivery to one company who in turn subcontracted it to another.
3,Nuts without the nuts,"OK, so, what do you do when you assemble the gym only to find 8 3/8"" nylock nuts missing from the container?"
4,Terrific investment,"The item arrived 5 days after I placed the order and the shipping was free! I bought this item hoping that it'd help me to gain some weight. It's hard to try to gain weight in a country where so many people are over-weight. I've started to gain some muscle already and I have a better appetite. An active lifestyle and a healthy diet would greatly increase one's wellness. The reason I give this one 4 stars because it can't be upgraded for more weight. For many people who lack the willingness to achieve their desired weight (like me), making an investment like this would definitely get them on the right track."
5,Perfect for my needs!,"This machine is sturdy, sets up easily, slides away into a corner when folded up, and only takes a 2-3 minutes to set up from folded position. So much easier than going to the gym. I'm no body builder so this machine is just what I needed."
5,"Terrific workout machine, with great documentation and plan","Very easy to set up, and easy to use. Changing resistance rods is easy enough. The docuemtnation for set-up and use is very good, the weight loss and exercise plans are good, and the range of exercises very good. I have not achieved all my goals yet, but around the holidays who can lose weight? The Motivator is highly recommended for getting to your fitness objectives."
4,A Good Album,"Here is an Australian release of one of the finest Rockabilly Artists ever. Bob Luman had a voice not unlike Elvis or even Johnny Horton, but his music was closer to the great Carl Perkins. Bob Luman's heyday was in the early-1960's when Honky Tonk was being infused with original Rock-n-Roll, and Luman's sound was the epitome of this movement. There are 34 songs here, and there's really not a bad one among them! Perhaps his biggest hit, what we'd now call a ""crossover"", was ""Let's Think About Living"", which did well not only on the country charts, but the Pop charts (of the day) as well. There are a few others that are immediately recognizable: ""You Win Again"" (a Hank song), and Don Gibson's ""Oh Lonesome Me"". This CD covers a 4-year period (1959-63), so it is not all-inclusive of Bob's career. But, if you like true Rockabilly, then this one is well worth owning. The sound is fine and detailed set of liner notes are included."
4,Great for teachers,This book provides great ideas and instruction for creating lessons for all students in the classroom. I have used more than a couple.
1,save your money,Contains a few interesting pictures but not much of anything else. This is mostly just a self serving bio on some guy who enjoys looking through a microscope
3,Part of the Shakesperian writing team?,"Yes, the novelist who gave us Hitchcock's ""Jamaica Inn,"" ""Rebecca,"" and ""The Birds,"" was also a historian, especially anything that had to do with her own family and her own ""country,"" southwest England.""The Winding Stair"" begins where ""Golden Lads"" ends. It begins with Francis at age 40, on the death of his brother.The title comes from the quote that one's ascent in life is like a winding stair, taking one step at a time.Easy to read, and fills in the gaps of Francis Bacon's life. But the best part of this is the fact that it was written by a celebrity in her own right: Daphne du Maurier."
5,Fantasmagorgasmlicious,"If you were ever a fan of Psykosonik, and wished for a second coming, well here it is. This first CD is their springboard single to what is undoubtably going to be a fantastic album. If that wasn't enough, you have 5 outstanding remixes each with a distict flavor from the same tasty aural dish. Throw in 2 edits, one being an instrumental that shows off the fantastic production skills. If you thought Psykosonik was done, think again. It's better then ever. It's your Basic Pleasure Model."
3,Good but not good enough,"Rifts Mercenaries would have been good if it wasn't for the numerous amounts of mercenary non player characters. Their were too many of these, everything else including the character classes, weapons, mercenary group creation guidelines were excellent including Naruni Enterprises, Golden Age Weaponsmiths, Wellington Industries, Iron Heart Armaments, Smuggler O.C.C., Special Forces O.C.C. etc. Overall get this book if your a tech-head and like mercenaries, but if your looking for something more in-depth and adventurous get Rifts:Canada or the Siege on Tolkeen series."
3,You are better off with Atlantis or Federation of Magic.,"This book does have some interesting O.C.C.'s and few cool weapons like my personal favorite WI-GL4 revolving gernade launcher. But as a whole the book was disapointing. 1/3 of the book goes into discribing sample merc groups. Also the introduction of Naruni Enterprises could have been left out.Their equipment and vehicles are to powerful and to strange looking to me and I hope the Coalition succeeds in purging the from the earth. Also I think that the point system for creating merc groups is stupid. If I want to make a Mecrenary Unit I will do it my self, I dont need some stupid system to get in my way. Over all I fell if you are a torn between this book and another, put of getting this one (unless the other book is Wormwood because that is the biggest piece of S*** book ever printed by Palldium.)"
4,Tammy's in Love and April Love and...,"This is a wonderful collection of the most popular love songs from hit films of the late '50s. Debbie Reynolds singing ""Tammy's in Love"" from the charming movie Tammy and the Bachelor has haunted my dreams since childhood. And it's not just me; ""Tammy"" was #1 on the charts and was the THE top soundtrack single for ALL of the 1950s; and another version done by the Ames Bros. went to #5 on the charts.Also there's teen idol Pat Boone singing ""April Love"" and the very popular Doris Day with ""Que Sera Sera"" and also ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing"" and... well you can read the titles above. This is a great collection of love ballads."
5,Jawdropping Beautiful Record,"The Handsome Family has succeeded again in improving on their enchanted craft. Rennie Sparks pens gorgeous poems filled with characters and situations as real and lonely as I've ever known. Husband Brett Sparks sings them with a warm, deep, baritone voice that would make George Jones blush. The beautiful irony of this warm/cold complement lingers with me long, long after each listen. The instrumentation on this record is spare and (again) warm, with precious little departure from their past triumphs.I suppose these words could be said of truly ANY Handsome Family record. As one who's familiar with them all I can say, with total astonishment, that this is a new height."
5,The hits just keep on comming!,"Brett and Rennie understand that darkness dosen't need to be all dark, nor strangeness wierd. These tunefull songs are clever, funny, and catchy, all the while hinting at the mysteries that lurk behind the ordinariness of day to day existance. Nothing like it. This is our third Handsome Family album, we love them all, glorying in the eccentricity. Besides, my wife goes all weak at the knees under the power of Brett's awesome baritone."
5,The Sadness Is Deliscous,"Simple,stark,sad and lonesome...that's the feel all the way through. Death, despair and darkness...made so real it hurts and gives pleasure at the same time."
5,Great,"In Iraq after we hear Qur'an we start our day with the voice of the Morning fairuz ,She makes me feels Baghdad mornings again .it's great CD."
5,Awesome CD!,"I purchased this CD as a father's day gift. I found this by searching 1940's music. My father, who was born in 1934, loves Faruz. I had no idea who she was, but made a great choice in purchasing this CD. He remembered seeing her on the beach when he was a child. This gift really made his day!"
3,Not very clumping,Not very impressed by the clumping of this litter. I had to throw away a lot of clean litter because it was mixed with the soiled one.
5,Great Kitty Litter -,Litter clumps great and suppresses oders.It also is a money saver compared to other litters.It comes in a very strong bag so bag won't tear like some litter bags.
3,does the job,"Usually I use a corn bases litter but was low on funds so gave this a try, it works but does track everywhere."
1,Not safe for babies,"This should not be marketed as a rattle for babies. We were impressed with the workmanship when we got this toy but as soon as our baby started playing with it--shaking it and whipping it around--we realized how dangerous it is (for her and for anyone nearby). A few thunks on the head and slaps on the hand later, this toy is now retired to the bottom of a drawer somewhere.... Not for babies!!"
5,Fun! Buy the clip... you don't want to lose this one.,"Max is not just the baby's favorite, he is the family's favorite! All the older kids love engaging their little brother with this toy. The colors are vibrant, and the clacking sounds are pleasant sounding when you shake it and/or pull on the wooden ring. We bought the blue polka dot clip to go with it, and clipped it on his car seat. Those bright colors keep him engaged and the sound is not annoying like so many other toys. I like being able to clip him anywhere without the worry that we'll lose our precious Haba toy. We love all the Haba toys we've bought so far, and this is one of the favorites in our growing collection."
3,Max - wooden pull toy,Max is very nice but I used it on the Meadow Play Rug by Haba and sometimes my son would pull so hard it would flip off and hit him in his face. I would suggest some of Haba's other wood toys. My son loved the one with the triangles and the one that looks like a fish.
3,maybe she will like it later?,My daughter is 7 months old and this toy doesn't really interest her. She likes chewing on the end yellow string. Maybe she will grow to like it better later?
3,its ok,max is very beautifully made..great to look at ..but my baby doesnt care for it at all.. honestly i enjoy it much more than he does..
3,"Nice set, voices are not the best","I have seen Netrebko and Vilazzon in a less then inviting ""Clock"" set and winning Zefirelli's production in a Met...Well, Madrid Opera Art-deco set is as much better then the ridiculous set of Salzburg production as voices are poorer... Neither Jose Bros no Norah Amsellem match up to Villazon and Netrebko brilliance.As far as set goes, I will pick Zefirelli's in a heartbeat. I must mention that I have heard Traviata in Met with Hei-Kyung Hong and Jose Luis Duval."
3,i wish i could buy cd1 only,"Cd1 has some un-f'n-believable loungie house on it. The last 4, 3 of which are his own, are without a doubt some of the best lounge-house i have ever heard, deeper and funkier even than miguel migs with #12 bieng the stand-out. While the first half of the cd is not chill or lounge it can only be described as ambient, but still not bad if that is what you like.Cd 2 on the other hand is nothing but cheezie house/trance.But the bright side is that if you like cheezie house/trance then you will love it ;-))"
3,Is any of D:Fuse old stuff more like CD#1 ?!,"I only heard 30 second sound-samples of each track...CD #1 seemed like really good melodic ambient trance...whereas CD#2 seemed like ALOT harder trance. The sound quality seemed Excellent on Both sides (UN-Like some other mixes that i've heard recently). SO, which of D:Fuse's older CD's are more like CD#1 ?????!"
4,In Search of... DVD salvation and reissue!,"Recall the series as a child very well. It fulfilled that corner of curiosities that we had and gave back something that we still have to this day. If it was about Egypt, Stonehenge or Mystery Hill (in the States) et etc. In Search Of.. did for us what the History channel and A+E currently does now. Leonard Nimoy did a splendid job being a host and lending a certain amount of dead-set, seriousness to the subject matter.My search will continue for the series reissue on DVD!!! Don't keep a good show like this confined to VHS-ism."
5,Great,this is a great video but the only thing you may want to be warned about is that it is from the 70's so it isnt updated.....otherwise it is an awesome video you can also watch In search of on the History Channel.
1,Get it as long as you like broke items,got it pretty fast; 4 days delivery time. finally got a chance and a day off of work to install it and opened the package and the main face plate that holds everything together was broken. Trying to decide if i want to super glue it or just get one from an auto parts store. DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT if you expect items that work and aren't broken.
5,Honbu Dojo Practice,"An excellent book, for beginners and experienced practitioners alike. The Authors are of highest grade as is their book; there is simply no contest. A review of all the ""Fundamentals"" an aikidoka needs to know and ""daily practice"". Highly recommended."
5,"This was a gift,...","This was a gift for a ... friend. Having had unusual difficulties ordering this item on her own, she was thrilled to finally get a copy.So I think it safe to say, she would've given this a five star rating, for the item and the vendor's quick response."
5,"Discover why you fell into living a cluttered, disorganized life, and how you can break free from stressful, debilitating habits",Vicki Norris explains the causes of disorganization and gives readers tactics to dig into their organizing projects. It changed my approach to organizing and made the task less threatening and more attainable. I reccommend this book to all of my friends and family. This is one book you must read!
1,No substance here...,"I got this book because I thought Ms. Norris would share some specific strategies for getting organized. I didn't find any here. Instead, I found that 90 percent of the book was bashing and psychoanalyzing people's shortcomings. I was surprised at how much she put people down. I know I have a problem getting organized. That is why I picked up the book. I don't need to be brow-beat or ridiculed. It appears that Ms. Norris is lifting herself up by putting others down. You won't find any practical help here. Just a lot of psycho-babble. I'd give it a zero if I could."
2,I kept waiting for the nitty-gritty...,"I was disappointed. This book is okay, but nothing great. (Sorry, Ms Norris, you seem like a nice person but I felt the book came up short.) I kept waiting to get to the meat of the subject; her strategies for organization. I found many generalizations like, ""Establish Systems"" and ""Consolidate Activities."" There were many nice stories about people she helped, and those who would rather die than change their habits.She promotes her web sites and her services. That's fine, but the products she sells are very similar to what you can buy at any office supply store, although her's look very well made and are therefore expensive.Check out, ""HOW TO GET ORGANIZED WITHOUT RESORTING TO ARSON"" by Liz Franklin. She has many different approaches depending on your style and needs, and gives nut-and-bolts solutions. The book is also a fun read."
3,Inspirational but Redundant!,"First off, I really enjoy watching Vicki Norris on television and seeing her work her magic. However, I don't think it takes 252 pages to convey the idea that if you are disorganized you need to assess your values and priorities before coming up with personalized systems of organization. I wholeheartedly agree that magazine articles and quick fixes are just band-aid solutions and don't work in the long run.I faithfully read each and every page until Part 3, Organizing Strategies (pg. 179) at which point I started to speed read because I felt like I was being hit over the head again and again with the same concepts and very similar examples from earlier in the book. Including some self-discovery worksheets would have been helpful because it would make the assessment process tangible.I still highly recommend it for individuals who need inspiration due to their feelings of being overwhelmed by the enormity of organizing their space."
4,Red Bull Metabolic Stimulus Drink,"Have not purchased RedBull online. One can purchased at grocery store. And, it has an amazing stimulus on the metabolism balance. Detected it having a chemical reaction on some inert area that created enlightening clarity of physical and emotional concience that, so far, has held for, at least, a few hours. A six-pack sure would do a number on average strenous daily harassing Get'erDone stuff."
4,Great Arm Workout,"I really like this video, I get a great arm and upper body workout and the floor work is great too. You do need to be in decent shape or go with no wieghts for a while to get used to the moves. If you are looking for a burn, this is where to go!"
2,Inefficient!!,"I already own 3-4 tapes and one DVD by Karen, and the common denominator is that they are too long. I thought this would be a challenging workout, but I was so bored with the amount of repetitions needed I've only done it all the way through once!! I don't think I could face it again without fast forwarding through a few reps!! Even the music was boring!If it weren't for one of the fine male members of her class, I'd have given up much earlier!!I'd recommend Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weight Vol One - Vol Two is good too (but for a bit of back pain in the glute section) and they BOTH have great music! Kathy Smith tapes ALWAYS have great motivating music, and motivation is key, but the music on Karen's tapes is nearly always awful. Karen's best workout is the one she did with Elle Macpherson."
5,Effective workout for the advanced exerciser,"Warning! This workout is not for the novice exerciser. I am a big fan of Karen Voight and find her to be one of the finest fitness experts around today. Her workouts are normally geared toward the immediate to advanced exerciser. This workout is intense and very, very, very effective! But way tooooooo long, 85 minutes to be exact. I use this video one to two days a week (depending on my schedule). There is a natural break in between the workout making it possible to divide the workout into two segments. You could do the first part of the workout in the morning and the other part in the evening or can do them on two different days. This is one video tape that does not get rotated out of my workout schedule. It one of my regulars because it stills challenges me."
4,Great overall toning for advanced exercisers!,"I am an avid exerciser who was looking for a challenging weight workout--I found it in this tape. I borrowed from a friend and am now purchasing my own. Awesome arm and stomach routine, great music, feel the burn in the legs. You do need to be in good shape and used to working with weights."
1,TOO MUCH SHOULDER WORK,"There are better ways to work the muscles such as back and chest, without having to overwork the shoulders as assisters. What happens is that your shoulders get overworked before you can actually work the other body parts. There are too many moving parts in some of the standing leg work and this would be much too diffuclt for the average person."
4,Would be 5 but missing best song?,"Wet Willie is an original and a classic, I purchased this album a couple months ago, (from amazon of course) I really like this compilation, however it is missing ""Street Corner Serenade"" which I think was the best Wet Willie song ever. So that explains the 4 star rating..."
2,Street Corner Serenade,"WHAT????? No ""Street Corner Serenade""??????? Screw this! Otherwise it'd be an excellent buy."
4,great shedding tool,"This tool works very well on my long hair cat.I have used it quite a while, and it has not gotten dull yet and removes shedding hair."
5,What noted readers might have said...,"What noted readers might have said: ""Such a book as this has great relativity"" --Einstein ""This book is creating a cultural revolution"" --Mao ""This book contains information that even I did not know about myself"" --Verne ""Alas, the authors of this book know Verne well"" --Shakespeare ""Finally, a book on Verne for everyone to share"" --Marx (Karl) ""How this book got in my pajamas I don't know"" --Marx(Groucho)"
1,Mom bought it for little brother - what a waste of money!,"Some teacher at a Montessori school recommended this, so my mother thought it was great. Did nothing but put my little brother to sleep. It sure cost a lot too. Better ways to teach your baby stuff. If you have some imagination."
4,Exactly what you'd expect,"These are great little replica helmets. I bought the Oregon Ducks green one and this one. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the stickers were not fully pressed on when I got it. Also, it says 1/2 scale in the description but it is really 1/4."
3,PATRIOTIC MUSIC,I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME SING-A-LONG MUSIC THAT PUMPS ME UP. THIS ALBUM WOULD BE GOOD FOR A LOW VOLUME DINNER MUSIC.I GAVE IT A MEDIUM STAR RATING. THE COMPANY ROCKS ON THEIR SPEEDY DELIVERY!
2,Tough to change pad,"Well, this does work as a mop, but the terry bonnet is hard to change. The head is also too large to use in the bathroom."
3,Niche Appeal,"If you are very young and contemplating a career in professional or serious amateur bicycle racing, this book may be of interest. It should not be your only resource, however, as the information is dated and the science has been eclipsed. Although I did find the section on bicycle fit very helpful.If you are an older cycling enthusiast, and want to get insight into the world of bicycle racing as a fan or spectator, or get guidance on riding or training, there are better books for that."
5,A good movie,A good start for how the waltons began a down to good movie for anyone who likes henry fonda and the way he does good acting
3,H. Fonda,"I did not think Mr. Fonda was the right choice for this movie, just OK...nothing special. I felt the film did not score as highly as the book it was based upon."
5,"Great movie, great quality!!","This was a gift for my husband, who loves this movie. He was very surprised with the picture quality. It was great overall.Thanks Amazon."
3,Spencer's Mountain,"This was ok, but I prefer the Walton's. I think the walton's was more about the whole family. This one seems to be centered around the oldest son (Clay Boy) and the rest of the adults. They are trying to find a way for Clay Boy to go to college. Similar to the Walton's."
3,"Good, Not Great","This is a good, solid ""family values"" movie which parents can watch with their children. It does have its sappy, unrealistic moments, but that is to be expected of a movie of this time period (1963). There is some good acting; probably Henry Fonda's most happy-go-lucky role ever. I doubt that I will watch it again, but it was worth seeing."
5,Spencer's Mountain,I give Spencer's Mountain a very high review. It's a movie that the whole family will enjoy for many years to come.
2,"Great For Laughs, Not Intentionally","In his movie book, Leonard Maltin calls this movie ""A Mawkish Sudser"" which is TOO kind. Perhaps, it's when the movie came out (1963) and the country was still coming out of the ""feel good"" 50's and hadn't yet see a young president assasinated, or that the writer Earl Hamner was getting us ready for The Waltons, but the movie is perhaps, TOO unrealistic. I will say though, I laughed myself silly watching it... really. Wally Cox in a serious role, a snicker- James McArthur as Clay-Boy, solid laughs-Henry Fonda in an idealic setting with no demons to frustrate him, rolling on the floor hysterical! Yeah, I'm jaded, but I actually enjoyed this movie for the unintended humor. There is BEAUTIFUL scenery... but then it gets funny again when Wally Cox walks in with a fedora six times bigger than his head. And if you really like it, hey that's cool, taste is subjective."
4,spencers mountain,after watching all the Waltons series first this one was a little disapointing. some things not too good in this movie.. little immoral
2,"I know I am in the minority, BUT....","I feel like an awful Scrooge to say it but I think this movie is just awful. It has pretty scenery and a big name cast, but the story is awkward and phony, with lots of Hollywood stock characters and trite characterizations. Now that I have said that, please enjoy it as an old-fashioned family movie that will not offend anyone with nasty things. Those are too rare, I agree; it is just that I don't think this is so great as a drama. Why not get a later Disney film like FOLLOW ME BOYS! (1967) or the even more recent and quite good TUCK EVERLASTING (2002) if you want family fare that is a little less icky than I think SPENCER'S MOUNTAIN is. Sorry folks -- forgive me if you are a fan of this one."
3,A classic,I heard about this as a for runner to the Walton's TV series. A great classic if you like watching old classics this is one to put on a must watch list.
4,Good movie.,"We enjoyed this movie. It's dated, but if you like the old TV series - The Waltons, you'll like this movie too!"
4,Classic Delmer Daves production,"""Spencer's Mountain"" , written by Earl Hamner, Jr. of ""The Walton's"" wrote this script in the 1950s and it shows. Like many of the Delmer Daves movies of this era, this film combines a Max Steiner score, great cinematography and a heart-tugging story from a more innocent America. This is a great movie to get lost in, enjoy, and have a good cry. I sit back and re-live this film at least once a year."
5,Fun family movie,Spencer's mountain is the movie that the Waltons television show is based on. It is fun and good watching for the family. Henry Fonda is excellent as the head of the family. He's a little less proper then the people around him and its fun to watch him act this way.
3,Not a family movie I would choose,Foul language especially coming out of kids mouth. Pus where he got the sunburn on his back? Not for kids.
2,Not as good as I remembered,I bought this because I remembered it as a good movie. I was wrong. Don't waste your money on this. Buy The Waltons instead!
1,AMAZON SERVICE,"so annoyed... I chose a different movie to add to my cart and purchase. Amazon defaulted to this one and now I am stuck with it, can't cancel even though less than 30 sec. have passed since placing order. It says to cancel with seller, but there is no way that I can find to contact Amazon. URGH! ONLY GAVE ONE STAR BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T LET ME GIVE NONE!"
1,Insulted,"We like the actors in this movie, and anticipated enjoying a good, family movie. We kept hoping for substance, but only were subjected to inuendo and uncivilized conversation.Children tend to immitate what they see and hear. I don't think you'd be happy if your children immitated things in this movie. I'd like to tell you about the ending, but I couldn't put myself through the process of getting to it."
3,"Good informaiton, hardly exhaustive","When I purchased this book, I was hoping it would essentially be a list of firearms of the period, with brief articles on each explaining their various qualities. Instead, the book is more general, discussing types of firearms, instead of specific ones. A few guns are given special treatment, and the information provided on them is detailed and complete. One thing I was pleased to discover in the book were clear explainations of how the firing mechanisms on the various types of weapons worked. Methods such as flint-lock, dog-lock, and so on, are explained using diagrams, giving the reader a clear understanding of how they function.In effect, the book is a good introduction to firearms of the period, but hardly worthwhile as a deep reference."
5,Clarifying Anselm and rightfully asserting medieval grammar,"Colish sheds reams of light on the understanding of knowledge before Aristotle's full influence on the Middle Ages. For those who find themselves trapped in unsuccessfully trying unravel the ""ontological argument"" of Anselm, Colish presents another way of looking at his theory of knowledge using grammar rather than a post-Cartesian rationalism. Her description of rectitude and its relevance for language in the Middle Ages clarifies many common misconceptions. Superb!"
4,Colorado's Lost Gold Mines and Buried Treasure,"This is mostly folk lore, or is it? Great ""old time"" stories of lost treasure buried in the Colorado Rockies told by someone who was there to capture the heart and soul of the stories from the old timers. A treasure of its own."
1,Caveat Emptor,"This appears to be a Windows theme pack when you purchase it from Amazon.com, but it is in fact a theme pack for Windows Mobile on a PocketPC. It will not work under Windows XP."
3,"Status quo, tolerable at best, electronics text","I used this book in an electronics class (EE301) at Purdue University. While it has excellent reference tables throughout the book that contain all the useful formulas, the explanations in the text are weak. The author(s) seem too busy trying to impress us with mathematical explanations to tell us why all this is useful in the real world. Unfortunately, this is the norm in electronics texts-- few professors ever have jobs in the real world, making it difficult for them to explain why all the rest of us need to know what we're learning. This book is no exception."
2,Very Unhappy,I just took a class that required this book and I found it to be incredibly unhelpful. I thought the explanations were poor and the examples weren't worked out fully and completely. Also there weren't nearly enough practical examples of how to best solve the problems.
4,Good startup step to commiuncation field,Good startup step to commiuncation field for all people that want get into the new technology -to built your fundmental understanding of sigal & system.
2,"Confusing, not well worded, etc..","Very confusing book. Seems to spend alot of time on very simple topics and no time on complex topics. Introduces important concepts in very illogical locations. Examples are not worked out clearly and rely on words such as ""clearly"" and ""by inspection."" VERY confusing book...find another!"
1,Not good,"This book assumes too much of the reader. Describing steps in problem solving with the terms ""by inspection and ""clearly"" do not help. This made the examples poor and the text useless."
3,poor explination of examples,This text does not provide solid explanations of the example problems. Instructions on convolution are vague and confusing.
1,"A wordy, indecisive attempt at describing the topic.","This book is required reading for Purdue University's EE301 class. The author assumes that we have already taken multipal signals and systems classes and that we already know how to do many of the ""tricks"" he knows. However, the majority of the time, he fails to mention which trick he is using, or clearly show how to work the problem in an orderly fashion."
2,Signals and Systems 2e review,This text is a little murky. There are not a lot of examples demonstrating all of the different cases. The theory is explained briefly followed by lots of problems that you have to figure out how to work out on your own. Overall it is hard to understand unless you have a detailed knowledge of the signals to begin with.
3,Needs better explanations and examples,"Although widely accepted as the standard text for introductory signals & systems courses, this book is sometimes unclear and difficult to read. Chapters covering introduction to LTI sytems and convolution theory are poor and confusing. Chapters covering continuous Fourier transform and sampling are pretyy good, however. The way in which the text shifts back and forth from continuous to discrete systems is annoying and not likeley to be useful in an actual course."
2,Large gap between problems and explanations in the text,"This is my least favorite book on the subject of signals and systems. The book is very wordy, and often explains things in overly simple terms, then presents extremely difficult problem sets as accompaniment. The section on convolution (a very simple concept, really) made my head spin. It's no good to spend three paragraphs explaining something that is essentially 1+1 = 2, then leave the student to do an exercise which is more like a differential equation."
1,Useless,This book just contains tables of formulas and horrible descriptions. It doesn't help you understand signals and systems at all. Read this book if you love memorizing things.
1,"far too few (mathematical) details, too much babbling","A lot of stuff in there, but it is all just scratching at the surface. If you really want to understand the mathematics behind it and what is going an, forget it. Example: Fourier Transformation. In what field are we working? Why can L2([0,1]) be identified with the nonperiodic Lebesgue Space l2(Z)? Hilbert Spaces and thus orthognalility aren't even mentioned. Example: Convolution. Under what conditions can we convolute (remember the equation of young?) Nothing about this at all. Mathematics are not at all (or not really in depth) dealt with. So it is no more than an under-undergraduate book to generally get a picture of what Signals and Systems are about. Too many trivial figures. Another problem are the 'solved problems'. Only answers to trivial problems are given; and they are no solutions but nothing more than the results. And where you really want an advanced problem solved you just got bad luck."
1,THE WORST ENGINEERING BOOK I'VE EVER SEEN,"Can we say USELESS?The book explains NONE of the problems in the back, and you basically can't use the book to help solve advanced problems.The worst part is, there are problems in the book WITHOUT ANSWERS, and I'm not talking about the odd #s or even #s, but I'm talking a huge chunk (where the real meat of the chapters are found in applied equations) lack solutions.If you're looking to use this book, I suggest you compare it with your best doorstop or table prop, and see if you really need this $75+ hunk of junk."
2,An Asset ??!!,"This book is okay when it concepts , but when it comes to problem solving techniques , it becomes a cropper . It is one of the worst books prescribed for an Under Graduate student . I am pretty sure , half the lecturers don't understand it's contents completely . And the examples this book provides is by no means an asset to it . Come to think of it , one thing is sure . Either the author seems to have had a complete lack of direction while writing this book , or , keeping an eye on the trade , he must have not given answers or worked out solutions to any of the problems within the book . On the whole , an utter waste of time and money ."
3,Convoluted Convolution,"I remember reading this book for one of my courses back in college. It's pretty decent but, the section explaining convolution is atrocious. It's only 3-4 pages long and there are only two-in the entire book- examples given. The first, which is trivial, is worked out in detail. The second more realistic example is not. The reverse would have been more a more illuminating situation. This text does a very good job on the other topics covered. Be warned however that the constant shifting between discrete and continuous signals in the book probably will not be how those subjects are taught in a course. Consider using ""Circuits, Signals, and Systems"" as a supplement."
2,"Not concise, not enough examples!","I have struggled through two classes utilizing this book, so I feel I do have a good sense of the material in it. It does say something about a textbook when your professor requires you to purchase a second book to fill in the gaps this book creates (Laplace transform). I feel I still do not have an adequate grasp of Fourier series - and I've read those sections time and time again. I eventually went to another textbook to teach myself the material on my own time.The lack of mathematical examples make the processes of understanding the material WAY more difficult than it needs to be. Another sore point: A lot of the understanding comes from the practice problems. Too bad there are so few answers in the back of the book. It leaves you to question what you have learned - if anything from the problem."
4,Good kids music- what a relief!,"When we had kids we hated to give up good music in favor of high-pitched vocals and overly repetitive hooks. What a relief to find some good kids music! Our kids are hooked on Dan Zanes and Laurie Berkner, and we couldn't be happier! Bring on Dan's ""Fooba Wooba John"" and Laurie's ""Victor Vito,"" we love it!"
4,Family Dance,We love this CD. Our 3 month old enjoys being danced around the room to the songs and calms instantly when we put it on in the car! We especially love the song Thrift Shop!
5,Fun CD,This CD has such fun music. I get these songs stuck in my head during the day they are so catchy. :)
2,"Most tracks are ok, but the two by ""Father Goose"" are awful.","My son loves the music, but the singing by ""Father Goose"" is unbearably nasal and off-pitch on ""Holey Pokey"" and ""Skip to My Lou"".Those two tracks make me cringe and I skip them every time my son plays the CD. However, several songs are wonderfully musical. For example, Linstead Market is just delightful."
1,this is an amazing work of art,this is an amazing work of art to certain people. i think it was th eworst thing ever. this was a total waste of money. i thiunk that is should be less. i will never buy a cd like this AGAIN!
3,I liked it more than my 3 year old,"It can be a challenge to find music that both parents and kids can agree on. We are huge Laurie Berkner fans, but I was ready for a change. I really liked this CD, but my 3 year old asks for Laurie after the first few songs. I think it's because Laurie's style of singing, lyrics, and music are a bit easier to follow and grab onto than Dan's. This CD is a bit more mature. It's great for parents (not only tolerable, but enjoyable)and maybe older kids would appreciate it more."
2,Overly Complex - Not For The Casual Stepper,"How can something so complex be so boring? Karen Voight's tape will give you a solid workout, but that's about it. She's a big fan purely athletic step. She doesn't distract you from the pain with a good routine and fun music. If you're looking for a step workout where you're not checking your watch or praying for the cool down, this is NOT the one for you. For Karen, it's all about stiff execution and painfully complex patterns. She's one of those atheletes who assumes we're all there with her for the sake of achieving a more perfect state of step. If you're like me, you just want to get the heart rate up, workout your muscles, and keep moving with the rest of your busy life. If that's the case, I'd keep searching!"
2,I can't believe how many people like this video!,"I bought this video because almost every reviewer gave it 5 stars and said it was a good workout and not too complicated. Some did say it was not for beginners, and that is definitely true. But I am not a beginner, and it is VERY complicated. The moves for the feet are complicated enough and when I felt I almost had the move down arms were added and before I could get that down a whole new routine would be started so quickly, and again over before I could get it down. Even the stretches were done very quickly. It was so frustrating and I felt that although I just bought it and only did it once, I find it unlikely I will pick it up again."
2,Only for experienced athletes.,"This video is not for the faint of heart. Everything about it is too fast paced for either a beginner or intermediate exerciser. Two of my friends hurt themselves using this tape. If you are already very fit, this tape would probably help keep you in condition, however."
1,SKIP THIS BOOK!,"This is a reprint of a book originally published in 1939 (though the description doesn't tell you...it's on the fly leaf). The writing is a bit stilted by today's standards, and the quality of the pictures is TERRIBLE (they look like newspaper photos from 1939). Save your money and buy any other book on skeet, which will most likely be of higher quality. I'll also mention Todd Bender's DVD's on skeet, which are outstanding (he's won many national and world championships, and he's a great teacher)."
3,Cute Earrings,They are well made and cute but too small for me. The labradorite stone in the earrings are specs. Good for children. Product is well made.
1,Poo on CSAA,"How in the world are we supposed to order a book that is listed as: Price is not available? I have seen it at the local CSAA office in Auburn, but am reluctant to purchase it anywhere when it is controlled the way it is."
4,Had one of these as a kid,"My first and only rocket in my childhood was a Wizard, and this one brought back some of those memories. With a C6-5 engine, this rocket really shoots up high (I'd recommend a B-size engine unless you like running a long ways). This rocket comes with a streamer instead of a parachute, which was disappointing, but it did not break when it hit the ground. However, my youngest son was playing with the rocket and one of the fins broke off, but I have glued it back on (not sure if it will fly the same yet).These Estes rockets are a great way to bond with your kids, both in building them and launching them off."
4,ok,this rocket is easy to build and the paint scheme is cool but the decals are supposed to be water slide decals and they dont work well. when i went to fly for the first time on an A8-5 it went straigt up and came down nicley the second time i launched it on a B6-4and it flew out of sight and it came straight down on the road. the nosecone snapped in half and the bdy tube was crushed i fixed the body tube easily and just have to buy another nosecone so all ended well overall tis was a great rocket.
2,engine and launcher needed,"Thanks to the enthusiastic reviews above that made me so excited. Upon it was shipped, I only found a couple tubes and a few pieces that were supposed to be the shell. The package said that it needed engine, launcher, paints, glue....which are NOT included. Therefore, be prepared to buy a lot more before you can really fly it. I bought it at $5 a piece during the holiday sale so I suppose there is nothing to complain about. But really did not expect more shopping one day before Christmas. Guess I have to tell my son we will fly it in the new year eve.PS: I checked the image on the product page and it showed what's included. I should've been more careful before placing the order."
1,totally fooled!,I purchased this item for son for Christmas. I was totally fooled. This item is just a small bag of unpainted balsa wood that needs complete assembly. It looks Nothing like it does on the web page.
2,Re: Torn cover,"Book came with torn cover, felt cheated. This should be mentioned at point of sale to enable buyer make decision."
4,So Far So Good,Haven't finished the book yet - but what I've read so far I really love. I've gotten alot out of what I have read and how to apply it to my business. Glad I bought this book - can't wait to finish it.
3,"Cute, but wheels do not stay straight","This is a very cute product in that the giraffe's eye spins, the ears are crinkly, and the shape sorter is unique. That being said, if you are using this on hardwood floors, the plastic/rubber wheels do not stay straight. For a little one who is trying to walk, they are not able to ""steer"" as well. They also do not have enough pressure to push down as they walk to keep this going in a straight line. Thus, after about two feet of walking, it starts to veer one direction or another when used on hard wood floors. If you were using this on carpet, it does work well.As a note, if using this on hard wood floors, I would only buy a walker like this that has rubber tires. I have the Melissa and Doug alligator chomper walker and it works great!"
5,Great!!! Can't beat the price...,Great!!! Can't beat the price and it cut my boot time down by 1/3! Upgraded my Car's PC from 512MB to this 1GB and it cut my boot time from 2 minute to 1min 30 sec. And it coast less then my 512MB Chip.
4,Go back to the days of spending the summer at the beach!!,"Recently I walked in on a good friend of mine that had bought this collection and ended up listening to it all night. It is a collection reminisant of the days when we all had the time to spend the summer at the beach no matter the cost or living condition that we had to endure. The one draw back is the inclusion of surf punk from the late 70s. Although I can remember when I loved the songs, they have not aged well and would have done better living in memory only. With that one small glitch it is a collection worth having."
1,"Rare Huh, Must Have um No.","If this is so rare why are there so many for sale here? If this is a must have, why are there so many for sale. I owned this. i sold it for way less than what its going for. The reason it;s OOP - maybe Rhino didn't sell enough. As a long time surf music enthusiast and player, there is too much lame common stuff here. So many of the artist put out great CDs and 45s that this collection just isn't worth having. Some of this stuff is sooo common. I say look at whats here and listen. See who you like and pursue those cds, 45s and albums. Some songs aren't really representative of the bands especially newer bands. Where's the Bomboras and the Fathoms and the Huntington Cads and Finks on disc 4. I say avoid like red tide."
3,Blind Melon,Not bad for a band that I personally thought did not deserve a greatest hits. I saw them live recently with Shannons replacement and I can honestly say they sound close enough not to butcher what they had built up until then.Overall a nice tribute to another stupid musician who could handle success.
5,Terrific!,"I just finished reading this novel and I thought it was terrific. I loved the characters and found the story totally absorbing, tender, and funny. This book deserves to be a huge success."
3,okay,"I watched a lot of anime but this one brought no one certain charm to me. It has potential (small but some) but i don't see it as really good. Samurai deeper kyo is a dvd to see and roruni kenshin, samurai x. S-cry-ed had nice action and yes was better then dbz at some points but not overwhelmingly better far from it, it only had the battle scenes go faster. I will check out vol.2 and maybe the storyline won't see so vague."
4,A great action series,"OK I've seen this series already subtitled over a year ago, its a great series. It has great moments and its crowning acheivement is its stylized fighting sequences, everyone has a personality to their powers. Superior ending episode too. The last episode is practically reason enough to buy the series. If your into the Xmen, DBZ, and a dark future story, this is definitely the anime for you."
2,"Eh,","People come on, this is alright but it's really nothing great. Th characters are cliche'd, the animation is below par, and the character design is extremely annoying. Skip this one, there are way better titles out there."
3,"Beautiful beginning, what happened to the rest?","I've tried to finish this book so many times and I always get stuck in the middle somewhere. The first part of the book is beautifully written. I've highlighted dozens of sentences in the first hundred or so pages because the language is truly gorgeous. But, halfway in and the story derails completely, it turns into a biography of some prostitute, the lovely flow of words is gone, and that's when I lose interest. Maybe I'll finish it one day."
2,Try other authors,"I couldn't agree more with the review writtten by Steve Koss.""Candy"" is a collection of sparsely scattered pieces of insight none of which are about the culture or any of the places where the story takes place. There is almost nothing there to justify its hype. Shanghai Baby (which is almost the same story as Candy) is better.Try the works of Guo XiaoLu (""Village of stone"" being a fantastic example of great contemporary Chinese literature), XinRan (""The good women of China"" a fantastic piece of reportive material) or Dai Si jie ( Balzac and the little Chinese Seamstress), or any of the writers suggested by Steve."
4,A relateable look into the Chinese underworld,"It's nice to find that even halfway around the world, other people are sharing your pain.I like to read books twice, and although the first time it was mainly a diary of a young girls spiral into the world of sex and heroin, the second time it was a chilling memoir. A release. A warning. The narrator is candid and brutally honest. She brings up a thousand things we all think and feel, and in much prettier language than most of us could ever dream. It's a compelling story, and I highly recommend it to anyone sick of the average fairy-tale ending."
1,!!,"Not only is the book poorly written, laced with mundane cliches and terribly unoriginal, but it reflects poorly on young Chinese writers as well! It is disgusting how much hype and attention is giving to ""literature"" that reads like inarticulate teenage-girl blogs. Shame on everyone involved in publishing this garbage!"
4,Oldschool reggae fans rejoice,"This is ""taking it back to the old school"" here. These songs from reggae's Ska era are quite vibrant and enjoyable. Laurel Aitken's ""Judgement Day"" was one of the earliest indigenous Jamaican hits which was quite controversial due to it's somewhat rasta-oriented lyrics. ""Chubby"" is of historical interest as it features genuine Rasta-style drumming in one of it's earliest-known recordings. The lovely ""Oil in My Lamp"" is actually an old Jamiacan revival tune souped-up for sound-system dances. But the real ""scorcher"" is the Maytals jump-up classic ""Jamaica Ska""(also variously known as ""Dog War"" and ""Broadway Jungle""). Something is WRONG with you if you can sit still while listening to this tune in particular. A few clinkers are in the mix, but overall, this is a worthwhile purchase. Much of it represents the optimism of the early days of Jamaican independence."
5,WOW! mountain biking at its BEST!,63 trails along the Mogollon Rim are well covered. Stevenson is a mapping genius. His elevation profiles prepare the biker before the trip. The accuracy is unbelievable. I highly recommend. Great book!
3,Art imitates Life,"If you've been to school, work under a boss or corporation, are a member of a trade organization, you should have already met every single characters in this movie: the authority seeking, the meek, the brave, the non-conformist, the vulnerable, the insane, the blind, the sheepy followers, the weak, the idealist, the... One just doesn't need to sign up for the so-called ""EXPERIMENT"" to be in it. We're all in it. This is a well-crafted and sincere movie, but there is nothing original about its characters-revealing plot."
4,"great movie, but amazon not so great!",The movie was great! However the experience was negative as I paid $26 from Amazon for this DVD and the day I received it was now selling for $8.70. Almost impossible to give that feedback to Amazon via their system. Would think twice before I make another purchase. I have been a loyal customer in the past.Les Marshall Tasmania Australia.
2,Average Movie,"I am not sure why people write the story of the movie in their reviews instead of actually writing a review.This movie is neither good nor bad; the acting is good in most parts but overall this is a normal movie in terms of story and sript.To compare it to ""Run Lola Run"" is unfair and if you are interested in watching more movies along the lines of human psychology I would recommend ""Cube""."
1,Discouraging-don't buy if you aren't a natural born dancer,"I am an advanced Tae Bo user and thought I would try something else for a change. I bought this tape and Paula Abdul's Get Up and Dance. I tried Strong & Smooth Moves twice and both times I was ready to give up and go to the Donut Shop. The Dance moves are so quick and the steps change too often. These purchases made me realize I am not into the dance aerobics and it gave me a new appreciation for Tae Bo. I can burn calories and tone all in one workout. Strong Moves & Paula Abdul's video are both filmed in a dance club type setting with flashy dressers, this is not what I am looking for when I wake up to exercise at 5:00am. These are the kinds of tapes that reminded me of why I never continued with a workout routine before Tae Bo was discovered."
1,cute...but they hurt,"I bought this for my two boys, one 3 1/2 and the other 1 1/2 years old, matching coz the look cute, but they have a border in the back that when you put the feet it slides in, so unless u buy it a bigger size, too hard to get in. Have to be worn with socks for the same reason. the width is not wide enough. the velcro barely closes on my kids. but very cute and sturdy, even though theyll not wear it much, they end up with blisters everywere. Im actualy hoping for them to losen up...coz i like the look. overall i regret buying it for them."
2,"Great shoe, but poor construction?","I purchased these shoes for my son for an event in June (for which they actually did not arrive in time). When they DID arrive, they were ever-so-slightly too big, but I had purchased them with the intent of them being his school shoes for the fall as well, so it was no biggie.Fast forward 2 months and *maybe* 5x wearing the shoes. The strap has come unstitched and is coming out of the shoe!!!! This is MOST CERTAINLY not the quality I expected or paid for when I bought Sperry Top-Sider. I'm not even sure after a few wears that I can return these, but I'm sure going to try!!!!"
3,"Well made and stylish, but wide sizes aren't wide enough...","These shoes are very well constructed (they look like they would last forever!) I love the appearance of these shoes. They have a clean, stylish look and would be great for school uniform shoes or nicer summer shoes.However, while these shoes seem like they would be super comfortable for boys with narrow to average width feet, they are not for boys with wide feet. I ordered the wide size for my son and they are not even close to wide enough. They look and fit like medium width shoes, not a wide at all. Disappointing."
3,Poor Packaging,The packaging was very poor. Placed book in the envelope so it was worse off when it finally got here due to shipping.
5,great,my 3 year old loves these. its really helping her with upper and lower case letters. she can totally play it by herself too.
1,Wont fit normal humbuckers,I dont know for what type of humbucker is this for but I'm shure is not for a standard one... I Meassured it in many humbuckers in many of my friends axes and it wont fit any.. It is WAY TOO SMALL FOR A HUMBUCKER... I'm even not shure if it could fit a p90.. Also you pay 6 dollars for two covers.. I though they were sold individually so ordered 2.. I got 4 useless covers... :/
5,I love this book,"I laughed and smiled a lot when reading this book. I felt like somebody finally understood me. I am a self-employed financial planner with 2 full-time staff. I got by when I was the only person working here. Now I have staff who are completely different. What once was workable (not great but workable) for me was frustrating for everybody. I have made significant changes in my office and in my organizational structure based on the book's recommendations. The book has paid for itself at least a 1000 times over and the benefits will keep on coming. The best part of this book was learning to ""translate"" my ""brain type"" needs to my staff and their needs to me."
1,Broke instantly,As soon as we turned it on the the two rubber rings both ripped and it was useless. Don't waste your money.
3,top knife,"overall a good book, with many practical tips. illustations are also good. i found the colloquial style irritating. ie. ""The distal pancreas can be easily resected, while the pancreatic head requires a very big whack."" These sort of practical manuals are valuable to practicing surgeons who know how to operate but can improve outcomes with the thinking portion of the operation, the art and craft of surgery."
3,Beat Boudoir,"I read of this cd in a magazine and I decided to buy it. I really like it, it's full of smooth grooves and a bit of lounge music as well. If you like lounge music you will probably like Beat Boudoir too. It has a bit of hip-hop and acid jazz on it as well, which makes this cd a pleasant mix to listen to."
3,Same as the rest for the price,I had a Zildjian bag for six years and the stitching on the outside pocket began to rip on both sides. This bag seems to be made exactly the same so I don't expect much more out of it.
2,the animated version is better,"If you've seen the animated version of Digimon, you might recognize some of the events in this book. The kids in the digiworld battle Leomon, Bakemon, Whamon, and other digimon. For some reason, the animated versions of these stories felt less disjointed - in the manga it just feels like too much is happening too fast, with digimon of the moment appearing every few seconds. The battles are also a lot better in animated form. The artwork just doesn't seem to capture those or digivolving (the transformation of a digimon into a more powerful form) very well."
5,Somewhere in time Collection,This is a very well put together CD that is both romantic and great for quite time. It is not the sound track from the movie but uses the that music as its base with the sounds of the sea .
4,Somewhere in Time music review,"Somewhere in TimeThis CD is so soothing that I listen to it each night before falling to sleep. Most nights I have trouble sleeping, so I can play it again to help me relax enough to fall back to sleep. When reading, I like background music that relaxes me or enhanses what I am reading. This CD works well for this purpose too."
3,Good for a 3-year-old,"There are only 7 episodes on this DVD:The Flying CatThe Missing MouseTwo Little IndiansTouche' Pussy CatThe Flying SorceressIs There a Doctor in the Mouse?The Haunted MouseThe extras are not even worth viewing, thrown together 3 minutes before they went to press. The only good thing about it: it is a DVD, which will play in our mini-van. Given those facts, my 3-year-old boy loves it. Anything ""Tom and Jerry"" and he is happy."
2,HALF as long as Greatest Chases - only 45min!!!,"It is sad that Warner Bros. has done this. For the price a person should expect the DVD to be approximately 90 minutes in length. (Movie price, Movie length) Greatest Chases is a wonderful DVD and was something like 87 minutes. Then along comes this DVD with that time cut in HALF! (But not the price) I give it half the rating because it is half a DVD. Send the message to Warner Bros. that we would like a WHOLE DVD by not buying this DVD."
4,An excellent Drifters complilation.,Rockin' & Driftin': The Drifters Box is an excellent overview of the Drifters long recording history. The quality of the recordings is first rate (as usual with Rhino). The first 2 discs are fantastic but the third disc falters as it documents the rather sad tail end of the career of the Drifters after the death of the great Rudy Lewis. The booklet that accompanies this set is very good and does a marvelous job tracking down the many artists who recorded under the Drifters name over the years.
5,excellent,"Being a collector of old do-wop 45's; I appreciate the original sounds. These are not remakes of Drifters that followed the orginial singers. I like the pamphlet that came with the CD's, a nice little history background. It's worth the money."
3,just okay,"I have read all of Agatha's novels and enjoyed everne of them. BUT, whenever I view a Miss Marple, I am always unhappy with the actress who portrays her. Just ruins it for me. I think they should all be redone with Maggie Smith as Miss Marple."
5,Could this happen here?,"Mrs. Dolly Bantry (Gwen Watford) tries to inform her husband of the reported body and is accused of imagining the report due to reading trashy books in bead at night. As usual, Jane is always in the right place to view the potential suspects. Clues are everywhere yet who would mix bodies and books?Speaking about night, I would not start this film to late, as it seems to go on forever at 151 minutes. As it was a made for TV (1984), I suspect that this video is a composite of a series. In addition, there are places where it takes leaps to different situations with out any transition. You can guess the plot in general but the details are surprising. It is wrapped up so quickly that you will need to run the ending a few times to put it all in perspective"
4,Maths & a mystery,"Plenty of maths in this film set in the city where persecuted genius Alan Turing lived, worked and died. The modern thriller elements are in black and white... the flashbacks to Alan Turing in the 1950s are in colour."
1,Good Luck,I do not recommend this to any one... A- Boring B- Return Customers Service Awful but then again every one is different
2,Not enough info,I thought this DVD would have had more basic info. Instead it's just a sales seminar. I could have saved my money.
1,DO NOT BUY,The cover image is not what the notebook actually looks like. It is ugly and boring and I regret this purchase
4,Everything You Need To Know In A Compact Guide,"Informative pocket guide giving history, culture and climate. Sums up 8 different areas of the island listing their highlights. Points of interest can easily be located on the maps provided. Has information on transportation, services and some accommodations. Color-coded tabs allow easy referencing of topics and routes. Great photos. A good source of information and a ""must have"" while travelling in Tenerife."
4,"Gave Me Brain Drain, But Loved It","I must admit I am a quiz show buff, and so I really enjoyed this book of Confederate trivia. I think I slept through history class when we were learning about the Civil War, but I don't know why because this period of US history is fascinating, and books like this really do make history come alive. I think the great thing about this is that it not only looks at the military side of life, but also civilian matters such as the politicians, food shortags, taxes, etc. You don't have to have a Confederate ancestor (though I did) to enjoy this sort of book."
4,Thumbs up from a US history teacher,"My husband and I are both big history buffs, and we've really enjoyed this collection of questions and answers about the Confederate States. I think books like this help people see that history is not boring and dry. I use some of the questions in my classes when I teach the Civil War period. This makes a great gift for men who are hard to buy for."
3,Interesting Book but Not All 'Facts' Correct,"While I did enjoy this book for the great wealth of obscure knowledge held within its binding, I do take issue with several questions/answers that I picked out that are wrong. I believe Mr. Lang does need to do a bit more research & provide better and/or more concise wording for several of the questions/answers. History buffs of all types will certainly enjoy this book...just don't wholeheartedly and blindly believe everything you read in this book. Enjoy!"
5,Recommended for all human resource executives.,Describes how information technology is impacting the human resources function and how to reengineer work processes and retrain staff accordingly. Examines current hardware and software applications. Includes a team readiness questionnaire. Recommended for all human resource executives.
5,Great Shows,I've really enjoyed seeing the shows from the beginning. I love this cast - they are balanced so well!!
5,I NEED CSI TO CHECK THE BODY IN THE CHAIR,"OH! It's my Hubby. He looks dead to the world but he is just glued to this C.S.I. MAIMI COLLECTION. My fault. I bought it for him. And he watches over and over and over again. Laptop on lap,earbuds in ears and he's David Caruso(without hair). Well as long as he is where he should be who am I to complain.Thanks C.S.I and Amazon"
1,Horrible,Did not cover the discolored leather no matter how much i would use on the section. i let it dry and re applied several times. very messy too.
4,Now You See Her by Linda Howard,This is an excellent book. I would definitely recommend it. Candra's unique gift and her relationship with Richard will keep you hooked.
3,A Good book but not as great as her previous ones.,"Compared to other Linda Howard books, this is a little disappointing. I usually have a hard time putting down her books once I start reading, but this one started out very slow. Too much descriptive passages and not enough character interactions. The plot and characters were interesting and unique though and the pace did pick up in the second half. But, as one other reader said, the ""villian"" was easily identifiable. I will still continue to read her books and would recommend them to others, but hopefully her next one will be in the same mode and pace as her previous ones."
3,Spellbounding,"Although this book is a Linda Howard standard, in forms of the plot and love making scenes. I couldn't help but be disappointed in how quickly the main characters Richard and Sweeny fell in love. Also the usage of ghosts were a major turn off."
3,Very mediocre,"Now You See Her was, simply, a fair-to-middling book. I got the same feelings I did when I read Killing Time by this author: she developed her characters imaginatively, began to write about a juicy plot, and then...my guess is Howard's deadline for completing this novel must have drawn near. Once the murder victim was dead I got the feeling it was a rush job, with lots of bland filler and predictability. The book kept rolling downward on this slope (which did at least contain a few good sex scenes)and ended with a brief explanatory epilogue to quickly fill a gigantic plot hole.So much untapped potential here. I recommend several books by this author, but this won't be one of them."
2,if you don't mind the anti-choice message...,"Howards is easy to read, a light mystery with romance thrown in. The beautiful artist with a strange ability to paint murder scenes before they happen, and a super-rich love interest didn't turn me on - but that's just a personal taste.My only objection is her condemnation of anyone who has an abortion. It is morally correct for the love interest to divorce not because his wife was an adulter but because she aborted his child. Wifey is not a sympathic character, but deciding anyone who aborts a fetus is evil? It wasn't a necessary part of the plot and seemed like a way to force her anti-choice message."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMEND,REALLY ENJOYABLE TO READ.I WOULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. I LIKED THE WAY THE CHARACTERS MET AND WERE ATTRACTED. SHE REALLY KNOWS HOW TO APPEAL TO A ROMANTIC READER.
4,suprisingly humorous!,"though i have read lots of linda howard's books before, i have to say this is the first one that made me laugh out loud! the suprising bit of humor makes it one of my favorite linda howards and it is definitely a page-turner."
3,"An okay read, more like a 3.5","I've recently started reading Linda Howard's backlist, and this one was an okay read. The characters weren't developed as fully as in the other books I've read by her, nor was the relationship between the hero and heroine realistic. Both of them did things that seemed too out-of-character (I don't want to ruin the story for anyone, so I won't go into detail). That said, the underlying plot was interesting, and I did read it all the way through to an ending that felt very rushed. It's really a 3.5, but I rounded down because of the weak characterization and the rushed ending."
5,Now You See Her,Really enjoyed this book. Characters are interesting and the heroine is very strong and likeable. This is my second time purchasing this novel. My first novel was borrowed so many times I had to get another one. Ms. Howard never fails to deliver.
4,Ms. Howard still has it!,"The paranormal theme was done well and I think the heroine portrayed herself well. I admit that it wasn't as intense as her previous novel Dream Man, I still wasn't able to put it down. The story flowed very easily and the connections of her newfound powers and her relationship with the hero is easy to see. It's a must read!"
2,Disappointing!!!,I give this book 2 stars only because the author had a good plot idea. I found the romance between the two characters awful.The plot was very weak. I have read some of her other books and enjoyed them. This came as a very big disappointment.
2,predictable,"in the beginning, the novel proved to keep my attention. but somewhere in the middle, i got bored. the plot became so transparent. first of all, there wasn't a wide array of suspects to consider. even the most amateur sleuth could make a reasonable guess about who the perpetrator was. i actaully skipped over many chapters just to get to the ending so i could confirm my (accurate) guess. i love a romantic suspense, but this was nothing i could sink my teeth into."
3,Started Out Promising,"I'd never read anything by this author before. The book started out promising but fell flat towards the middle and definitely at the end. I figured out ""who dunnit"" right away. The paranormal beginning was great but the author didn't do enough with it. Also, the relationship between the main characters was flimsy and not well developed."
2,Not Impressive,"My first Linda Howard book was Mr. Perfect and I was hooked. I was sure I would love anything written by her and immediately picked up Now you See Her. I was bitterly disappointed.There is little interaction between the characters and no rationalization as to why they fall for one another. It doesn't flow but just has sections of sensual get togethers with no real meaning behind them.I found it hard to follow and not a good read. I'm starting All the Queens Men and hope I enjoy it as much as Mr. Perfect but if I don't, I'm done with this author."
1,"BORING, DON'T WASTE YOUR EFFORT, SUB-STANDARD","I couldn't get into this book. I read through the first 10 chapters and still was waiting for the story to take off. The characters were weak, the plot (although unique) left me cold. I had to stuggle to get through the ten chapters that I did read. I am a real big fan of Linda Howards, and this just seemed below par for her. But, I will continue to read Linda Roberts, even someone with Roberts' talent can have an off day."
1,Porn disguised as a romance/thriller,"Dreadful!!! I do not read romances, so I don't know if this book is the norm. It is supposedly a thriller, but the thrills are few, unless you count the numerous graphic sex (and almost having sex) scenes. A murder finally happened--I knew who was going to get killed at least three chapters before it finally happened. The killer was so obvious it was pathetic. If you are looking for a good who-done-it, go elsewhere. If you want to read all about the girth of a certain man's penis, by all means jump right in, you will get plenty of that!"
3,Lightweight but entertaining,"This is not as good as some of Howard's best (like Son of the Morning), but I found the characters likeable, their romance charming. In some ways they reminded me of J.D. Robb's Eve Dallas and Rourke (though no one can come close to those two for great romance between a tough, emotionally skittish woman and a fabulously strong man who is determined to love her whether she likes it or not). I also wondered how Sweeney, after deliberately isolating herself from relationships all of her life, could so suddenly and without internal conflict cleave to Richard. The murder mystery wasn't one; the culprit was painfully obvious, and there wasn't really any suspense about whether Sweeney would be harmed when she became a target; Richard was too damn good at protecting her. But overall it was a quick and enjoyable read; if you find it in a used book store, go for it."
4,An enjoyable read in Linda's favorite storyline,"I enjoyed this book, although I think sevreal of her previous books dealing with ESP/mystery/heroine in peril, were better. This book remined me to reread them!"
4,ARE YOU COLD YET?? START A FIRE BEFORE READING THIS!!,"GRIPPING, COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN, VERY EASY READING, BUT I THINK THE ENDING COULD OF BEEN BETTER. I KNEW WHO THE KILLER WAS BEFORE THE END. ONCE I KNEW THAT I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS EVEN GOING TO GET BETTER. BUT, HAPPILY EVER AFTER IS THE ONLY WAY TO GO!!! MY FIRST LINDA HOWARD READ!"
2,Just Plain Creepy,"I've been a Linda Howard fan for years, but that seems to be changing. Her latest offering is something I never would have read if the author hadn't been Linda Howard. Ms. Howard's shift into romantic/suspense books is starting to take a turn for the worse. The author should stick to what she does best, writing books filled with rich characerizations and compelling plots--not to mention great love scenes. We simply don't need the creepy murder and paranormal stuff."
3,Somewhat disapointing,"Now You See Her is only my second book by Linda Howard, my first being Dream Man. I felt this book didn't have good characters and I didn't really feel for them.A year ago, Sweeny began seeing strange things, dead people. Also, other strange things began happening, lights would turn green all the time, she would know the answers to Jeapardy before the questions was asked. Just strange things.Then recently, Sweeny would wake up in the middle of the night and ""sleep paint"". In the morning she'd wake up to find she had painted a murder scene. The scary thing was, she knew these people. One day she woke up to find that she painted shoes only, in order to find out who was murdered she had to complete the painting.I found this book to be lacking (see, I can't even figure out what to write in a review for it!). The love story between Sweeny and Richard seemed thrown together just to have a love story. Although not terribly bad, I'd pass on this one"
2,Rather dissappointing :-(,"Despite her recent offering, Ms Howard will nevertheless still be one of my all time favourite authors. For those whose first intro to Ms Howard's work was Now You See Her....you ain't seen nothin' yet till you read this Top 3! After The Night, Shades of Twilight and Duncan's Bride. P/S Dear Ms Howard, I am waiting patiently for Chance Mackenzie's and John Medina's turn at your creative spinning. Please knock my socks off with their stories!! I hope I don't have to wait till the year 2000 though."
3,"Good, but not Linda's best...","I am a huge Linda Howard fan and have most, if not all, of her books. This book was a good romance, but not up to Linda's standards. To first time readers of Linda's books, I say go back and find ""Son of the Morning"" or ""Dream Man"", which are so good, they don't even compare to this one. To Linda, I say please take your time with the next one. You can do much better and have done much better. To the editors, I say let Linda write and don't rush her."
2,Now you don't!,"Linda Howard is usually more fun and she really needs to find heriones who don't sleep walk. Compared to her other books this one was too...sappy! I knew who the killer was, and in reality I didn't even care. I was not worried about the killer because the characters were not worried about the killer. They seemed more interested in the moral dilemma of having sex.Not worth buying but if you can borrow it from the library, knock yourself out."
3,Average offering from the talented Ms. Howard,"Compared to many romantic suspense novels out there, ""Now You See Her"" is quite good. However, it falls short when compared to Ms. Howard's previous work. There's just not as much of the wonderful depth and complexity that makes titles like ""After the Night"" or ""Shades of Twilight"" so memorable. This book is certainly worth reading, but wait for the paperback or borrow from the library."
4,Red-hot!! Must read!!!,"I don't think Linda could ever write a bad book. This book has some sex scenes that will make you want to find someone just like Richard. The only drawback I find is that it seems to be a recycled book (a copycat of her previous book, Dream Man)."
4,"Good, but not up to par for LH","Another pretty good one by Linda Howard. Good plot, interesting and likeable characters. I'll have to say that the suspense and action weren't quite as good in this one as previous ones I've read, but it's still good. Actually, it started out really suspenseful - had me raising my eyebrows first thing.... however, the further along in the book I got, the less suspense there was. She didn't fool me at all with the twist at the end - had it figured out. Still yet, I enjoyed it.... the romance was good, the paranormal aspect was interesting (although I never had my questions answered), and it was an original plot. If you like LH, go ahead and read it for those reasons, if not the suspense. Honestly have to say that it's a 4 star romance, but only a 3 star suspense."
4,Love and the Ghost Whisperer,"As usual, Linda Howard provides a provocative, suspenseful and sexual story which is fascinating and entertaining. Probably the best description is that of love and the Ghost Whisperer. The author provides a look into the thoughts and behavior of all of the characters, however, at the end, she sends you into an abyss. Unlike some of her other books, such as Loving Evangeline, which provide adequate closure, she stops at the philosophical. You do not know now Sweeney's paintings sell or if she is married and pregnant, nor do you know where the couple lives of if the senator was punished. This is a well written book until the epilogue."
4,"My first Linda Howard,,,","...definitely not my last. I found this book on the mark-down table at my local used book shop. It sounded intriguing, and I can't say I'm sorry I bought it.I really enjoyed this book a lot and will agree with another reviewer's comment that the 'villian' was super-easy to figure out from the get-go. What I disagree with that same reviewer about is the main character of Sweeney being whiny, naive, etc. (ok, I'll admit she was a little naive in telling Kai not to go to the police about the painting). I really liked Sweeney and thought she and Richard were a good couple - they seem to share a lot of the same values. I admire both of their decisions on not dating or sleeping together until Richard's divorce was final.That said, I absolutely, positively felt let down with the way the book ended. What was up with that?! I feel cheated! :-)"
2,Not up to Linda Howard's standards,"I have enjoyed all of Linda Howard's books, with the exception of this new one. The heroine of ""Now you see her,"" lacks character and is whiny. She only has one friend, Candra, but this does not stop our heroine from getting involved with Candra's husband. Although Candra and her husband are separated, loyalty from the heroine would not be misplaced. In a time when solidarity is an appreciated attribute among women, this book betrays that. The characters of the book are not likable, they are bland and no one cares about what happens to them. The mystery does not exist and the ending is no surprise at all. I can only hope that Ms. Howard's next project will be in tune with her previous work."
2,Just the outline,"While I have always enjoyed Linda Howard books, I believe that she is now writing short stories. Now You See Her (& Kiss & Tell) appeared to have been rushed to the publisher while still in outline format. There is little or no character development and the plot is extremely thin. While it's a good start, the book was far from finished. If this ""wham, bam thank you 'mam"" style of writing continues, I'll be a former Linda Howard fan."
2,Linda Howard Could Have Done Better,"As a fan of Linda Howard, I was greatly disappointed in her hardcover debut. The characters & mystery could have been developed more. This is almost more of a short story rather than a full length novel. The story doesn't really even develop. Save your money for the paperback or borrow someone else's copy of the novel. Linda really needs to return to the style of writing she exhibited in ""Dream Man""."
2,Disappointing,"Linda Howard's latest is very disappointing. Predictable and trite, it's an unfortunate debut for her first hardcover. Let's hope her next effort is more successful."
3,Not her best/not her worst,"Linda Howard is one of my very favorite authors, but this work is definitely not her best. It is a good read, but I agree with one of the other reviewers in that it was similiar (paranormal) to DREAM MAN, which was excellent. She is capable of much better. I will still buy her next book whenever it comes out."
3,Could have been better,"When Linda Howard started writing mainstream titles I was overjoyed. Now I am beginning to wonder if her publishers are holding her back. Her Silhoutte IM titles are still the best work she's ever done. DIAMOND BAY and MAC'S MOUNTAIN are two notable titles. She has lost her edge and charactor impact in her mass market work. In NOW YOU SEE HER I have to agree with the reviews here. There were too many questions left unanswered. The villians"" were mere cartoons. Even her trade-mark sexual tension was missing from the h/h. I will continue to read Howard - in paperback only."
3,Not up to her other books.,"I have and have read every one of Linda Howard's books and have enjoyed them all. Great plots, great and hot romance and great heroes and heroines (in most cases).I found this story rather silly and the love which immediately deveoped between Richard and Sweeney rather unbelieveable. It did not take a genius to determine who the villians were. To me it was obvious as soon as the crime was commited. I have come to expect much more from Ms. Howard. In my opinion her very best was Shades of Twilight and MacKenzie's Pleasure. I loved those stories and have re-read the latter several times.Hope the next book is better and up to her usual standards."
3,"surprisingly good, given it's questionable plot","Linda Howard is hit or miss. Her later work in the Kill and Tell and All the Queen's Men stage is highly recommended. Dream Man, her short story collections and others are so lacking in plot or character development as to be painful and make me feel somewhat embarassed for Howard that her name is on them. That said, I rate this book with the former. As a general rule, I hate all things other-worldly in a plot (it's unrelatable and tends to be a cover for lack of an actual good idea.) When I succeeded in pushing past that psychological block, I found that Howard handled the physic aspects with aplomb. Her heroine was mildly abrasive and loveable at the same time, her hero compelling and secondary characters surprisingly vivid. I shocked myself by liking this one - of course you should keep in mind that I also had absolutely zero expectations going into it."
5,Wow! Wow! Wow!!,"Linda Howard - you certainly have not lost your touch! This book grabbed me from the very first page (or I grabbed it!) and I polished it off in a day and a half! It was FANTASTIC!! It was so easy to picture Sweeney physically.She was so cute and vulnerable. Her relationship to Richard was very well done: I could feel the electricity from the two of them jump right off the page. Howard always has been good at sex scenes and she certainly does not disappoint! The suspense was taut and exciting. The paranormal was a great element - it reminded me of SON OF THE MORNING, which I believe was her finest effort. Even though that novel was about time travel, this one had the same kind of ""supercharged, supernatural suspense"" to it. Gosh! I loved it!! My heart is still racing from the excitement. (I just finished it half an hour ago!) Excellent and highly recommended."
2,not that good!,"After reading all the reviews of Linda Howard's books, I thought she would be a really great author. However, I was pretty dissappointed once I started reading this book(I have finished about three-fourths of the book)The sexual tension for which the author seems to be so renowned is certainly lacking in this one.There is hardly any interaction between the lead characters,the story focuses on the secondary characters as much as the lead ones.I found no reason as to why the hero fell so suddenly for Sweeney.I feel nothing for the hero & heroine as their is no real development of their characters. Overall, it is a pretty mediocre book."
3,Good but not up to her usual standard,"This book is fast paced, however, I felt it was rushed towards the end. The ending was unsatisfactory, it would have been nice to read about the outcome of the last culprit behind the murder; instead there was a vague explaintion how Sweeney became a clairvoyant. The plot reminds me of Ms Howard's Dream Man, which is a much better read where the heroine was a lot stronger and the suspense sharper. Sweeney just didn't click with me and she seemed to spend a lot of her time shivering with cold or fear. For a person who had spent her whole life looking after herself, she seemed to cling on to Richard very easily. An average read."
2,Great story idea.....disappointing story!,"This was your basic paint-by-numbers, fill in the blanks plotted story. This is my first Linda Howard book. I bought the hardcover, based on the flap copy...it sounded like a great story...painter who paints murder scenes before they actually happen...Unfortunately, the story never really went anywhere. The characters were never fully developed, just predictable cardboard stereotypes. The hero was instantly in love with the heroine, so there was no real conflict or growth there. The soon to be ex-wife was cheating and promiscuous for no apparent reason. I just didn't buy into any of it, and felt a bit cheated..There were no surprises and I really would have liked to have seen the psychic element explored a little more too. The whole book overall just seemed simple and shallow....if this is representative of her work in general, I will take a pass...."
2,Definitely NOT her best work....,There was something missing throughout the book....I can't place my finger on it. It was too fast paced and also highly predictable.
1,Crazy!!,"Everyone else is right, I get 4 packs of Doubleshot Light at Target for $7 each. You would have to be crazy to buy this! I kept reading it over and over thinking I must have misread the product info, but I didn't."
1,Ridiculously Overpriced,"This is actually, unbelievable.Safeway and Target sell this same item, regular price for about $26 cheaper. $24 for 12 units (three 4-packs, total 12 pcs.).Not to mention, they often go on sale for $7 ea., or $21 for 12, or $29 cheaper.The coffee is good, thats why I buy it, but the price on Amazon is astronomically too high."
2,"14 Packs(3sets+2bk) Lc41 INK for Brother Dcp-110c,dcp-310cn,mfc-210c,mf c-410cn, Mfc-420cn, Mfc-620cn, Mfc-3240c, Mfc-3340cn, Mf","This 14 Packs(3sets+2bk) Lc41 INK for Brother Dcp-110c,dcp-310cn,mfc-210c,mf c-410cn, Mfc-420cn, Mfc-620cn, Mfc-3240c, Mfc-3340cn, Mfc-5440cn, Mfc-5840cn, Fax1840c, Fax1940cn, Fax2440c. Total 14 Packs is not so great. Sometimes the printer doesn't recognise the ink catrige when replaced."
3,Disappointing performance of the first symphony,"The first symphony is played much too fast, and the notes loose their clarity as a result. I like the performance of Yuri Temirkanov and the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra much better."
1,does not fit what they say it does,it said it fits 2002 and newer kia sedona it only fits 2002 to 2005 kia sedona and they were no help in making it right
4,this was a tight cut back in 04,"I was hit&miss with his Album,but ""Confessions"" part 2 was the cut. I wasn't feeling the other re-mix,but this cut was on point. very honest track. it was cool. Usher got robbed that year at the grammys. this is tight cut. just tell your chick you got a baby with another chick. real smooth. what's the Problem?"
3,Ok,"I still think Andrea Zani is an interesting composer that deserves further exploration, but this recording will not add much to his merit. If you listen carefully to this cd there are some very interesting moments, particularly in the solo violin line, but these are not effectively highlighted. There are some nice, if commonplace, slow movements that could have been better played in order to hypnotize the listener thus allowing the music to beguile one's cares for awhile.The sound recording itself is not of the best quality. Some ensembles seem to prefer to record in churches or halls and there is a resulting decrease in the clean digital sound that I think most people prefer and which is achievable by recording in a sound studio.Still, this is the only recording available of these concerti and they are not bad ones at that. I would recommend this cd to afficionados of Northern Italian baroque."
1,Feedback,"For the beginner , this book is a waste of money. For some one who is more than a beginner, it is acollection of musical pices ranging form the beginner to advanced, and there fore may be useful. It is essentially devoid of instruction."
2,"Cheaply made, hangs up","I have a Davis Weather Wizard that my wife gave me for my birthday. The positive thing I can say is that it usually works. The negatives are that it's not well made and the display freezes up from time to time. To fix the display requires unplugging from the wall charger and removing the battery. Davis customer service confirmed that this is a problem and recommended a surge suppressor on the wall charger...didn't make any difference.If I had it to do over again, I'd look for a better made system."
5,Picture light,love love it! perfect lighting on my painting! Very fast shipping and was very impressed with this product. Would definitly order on of these again if I had another painting. It also came packaged nice!
5,Great dog food,"I was feeding the Salmon recipe but found my CBR (Chesapeake Bay Retriever) pup seems to do better on the bird rather than the fish. I have real salmon to feed him too, so this works perfect. Really like this dog food & it's reasonably priced too. The best part is how fast Amazon gets it shipped to me on this remote island!"
4,okay...,"This was a little high priced, and I'm bummed I can't find it at the store. But I think my dog liked it!"
2,Less meat in new formula,"I've never used this product before, but had a coupon so thought it would be worth trying, I looked at their site and checked to make sure that the protein was still adequate (which was 28%), when I got to the store, they received new bags, which is now only 22% protein, which is not enough meat to grain ratio. Theres better options on the merket, they make cost little more, but at least you're not getting jipped."
2,Mold?,"Ingredients and reviews look good. However, this is the first time I've ever found mold in my dog food. I have a specific container that I put my dog food in so it doesn't get any moisture. It's even air tight. This could be the best dog food out there, but if the quality control is bad, I won't be buying it. I'll add pictures of the mold or whatever is growing on the dog food.Update:So when I placed my initial order, there were two bags. The first bag had the stated problem and was tossed but I didn't have any other dog food on me at the time so I went ahead and opened the second bag. I kept a closer eye on it this time and it's been close to two months and I've not had any problems. My dog's fur seems to be in good shape and he's very active. Because of the horrible experience with the first bag, I still have to give this product a low rating and will stick with other brands. If there's not QC issues though, this would be a very good brand to try."
5,Holistic Select and Amazon Prime = A+,"We have four dogs and they have done very well with the Holistic Select line. It's a bit more money but if you look at the ingredient list, you'll see why. Our dogs have not had digestive issues and their skin and coat are healthy. I am also a happy camper for not having to drag a big, bulky and heavy bag from the store to car to home. The product is priced right and shipped super fast. Amazon Prime is so worth it especially if you order a lot of stuff online."
4,Good product..But dogs hate it!,My dogs hate it... I dont know if its just the flavor because my dogs dont even eat tuna fish. I am going to try the chicken next...
5,Excellent dog food,"After a rash of pet food recalls about seven years ago we went searching for a brand that was not involved in recalls--and that's how we ended up with Holistic Select. Never a regret, it's an awesome dog food. And as it turns out, not only has our dog done well, but she thrives on the hypoallergenic duck and oatmeal type."
5,Excellent product!,Best dog food out there! Good ingredients and my dog loves it. We first started purchasing this dog food at the recommendation of a friend for our miniature schnauzer.
5,Dog food,"I can't stress enough how great this dog food is. My lab LOVES it! And his coat, eyes, and overall good health proves what a great quality food Holistic Select is. Ordering it from Amazon makes it so easy! It's delivered right to my door (No more heavy lifting) and the price is cheaper than most pet stores."
2,Breeder recommends but dog rejects,We have a corgi and this kibble is one of the only two things that the breeder recommended. Unfortunately our dog does not like this food. He would NEVER eat a pellet on its own. We always have to mix it with real food and even then he sometimes refuses to eat it. On top of that none of the pet shops in our area carry this food so overall big PITA.We are still ordering from Amazon but looking for an alternative.
2,Just Okay,"Was expecting more with the high price but my dog barely touched this, and when he did eat it he would have food allergies"
2,"My dogs got sick off a bag,and cost me 300$ in vet bills","I have been feeding this brand to my bulldogs for 2 years. Petco stop carring it, so I have been buying from Amazon. I buy two 30lb bags at a time.. I never thougth it would make by bulldogs sick. I stop feeding them from that bag, and opened the new one after I had taken them to the vet and they eventually got better. I ran out of the 2nd bag so I put them back on original bag, and they started vomiting again..It's hard to see my pupps so sick, and don't know if I should keep buying this brand."
4,Strictly Old School,"There are approximately four songs, that were released during my high school years. "" Love On A Two-Way Street"", is the song that triggers the memories, of a time in my life, when songs of love, especially young love, meant something! Raymond Oakley-St. Louis, Mo."
3,STEVE D. NOT HAPPY,"THIS IS A GREAT CD, BUT THERE IS A PROBLEM. TRACKS 6 AND 7 ARE NOT BALANCE. YOU HAVE SINGING OUT OF ONE SPEAKER AND MUSIC OUT THE OTHER. THERE ARE OTHER SONGS THAT SOUND UNBALANCE. WHEN I FIRST PURCHASED THIS CD. I THOUGHT IT WAS DEFECTIVE, BUT IT IS NOT. I AM RETURNING THIS CD FOR THE SECOND TIME. THE REASON I GAVE THIS CD 3 STARS BECAUSE OF THE SONGS. DO NOT BUY THIS CD. RHINO NEED TO RECALL THIS CD OR RE-REMASTERED. ONE THING I WANT TO SAY, I HAVE PURCHASED CDs THAT THE ORIGINAL ARTIST SONGS WAS RECORDED IN MONO TO CD AND THAT THEY SOUND ALOT BALANCE OF WHAT I HAVE HEARD."
4,Old Music,Listening to this CD brought back sweet memories of the early 70's and when we use to have house parties with the blue lights in the basement! Those were the good old days!
3,It could be better,"That this CD contains a truncated version of ""Love On A Two-Way Street"" is TOTALLY inexcuseable. The Harry Ray solo cut and the long version of ""Sexy Mama"" almost make up for this. Almost.Otherwise, kudos to Rhino for getting a halfway decent sound from songs that were recorded under less than state-of-the-art conditions.It's a shame that since the CD revolution, ""...Two-Way Street"" mostly shows up in this truncated version. The only places I know of where it's the complete version are two Time Life collections (""Hey Love"" and ""The Magnificent Harmony Collection"") and a fuller sounding mix on a British Moments compilation, ""New Jersey Soul"".I hate to sound like I harp on things, (no, that's not entirely true.....) but that's why I knocked two stars off the CD."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"This CD deserves a zero star rating. The engineering on this CD takes away any hope of enjoyment. The mixing is absolutely terrible. The group sounds as if they're trying to scretch out and shatter someone. This is an all-time group, but the quality control is AWOL. Love On A Two-Way Street is the only song that sounds decent, and yet..."
5,Just do it!,"A well-stocked, thoughtfully presented collection of puzzles. A well-ordered progression of difficulty. Flex that i.q. with this joyous/painful/gainful workout!"
4,LOVE IT!,"VERY COOL VOICE, UNIQUE ALMOST LIKE STEVIE NICKS. THE MUSIC HAS A VERY 70'S SOUND TO IT. I FIRST HEARD ANNA WILSON ON RADIOIO INTERNET RADIO (RADIOIO ECLECTIC), WHICH IS A GREAT STATION TO LISTEN TO FOR UP AND COMING ARTISTS. ""THE BUS RIDE"" AND ""BROKEN"" ARE GREAT, BUT MY FAVORITE IS ""IT'S GOT ME"".I HOPE TO HEAR MORE FROM ANNA WILSON. IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO HEAR A NEW SOUND AND STYLE. SHE'S AWESOME!"
2,Disappointment,"This collects some issues of X men as a graphic novel and I was really disappinted it did not involve political intrigue, just a laid back look at the X men."
4,Pretty good follow up,"this was a great follow up to the great first arc The Tomorrow People. This arc introduces Nightcrawler, Rouge, Juggernaut and Sabertooth who all are ok with Nightcrawler being the best who was really characterized in his good 2 pages of english. The rest are pretty bland which keeps this from getting a 5 star along with the relative absence of characterization with most of the X-Men. Arc is pretty good other than that nothing special."
2,Disappointing,"Overall, this comic compares very unfavorably to both the regular X-men titles and to the other Ultimate titles (especially ""Ultimate Spider-man"" and the flagship ""The Ultimates""). I understand but don't agree with the decision to launch the series with an all-star line up of the most popular X-men, rather than with either the traditional classic or modern teams. The problem is, it doesn't feel original. Rather than a re-imagined team, this team is a cut and paste from various other sources (Iceman and costumes from the movies, Cyclops from the 90s comics, etc), and the whole thing seems a bit lazy. The writing style is very similar to Millar's work on ""The Ultimates."" The dialogue is worse (characters all have the same voice and mannerisms), but the basic pattern of visual exposition with grandiose, movie-like shots is maintained. That worked well with larger-than-life characters like Captain America and the Hulk, but doesn't fit personality-driven characters like the X-men."
5,Amazing Collection,"This second volume in the series has excellent artwork, a great storyline, and lots of action. This is what X-Men is all about. If you like to read and like X-Men, you should have this product."
4,The last refuge of the Third Reich,"The virtual reconstruction of Hitler's bunker by Christoph Neubauer is just impressive.The thing that struck me is how modern the whole thing looked. Keep in mind the fact that the construction started in 1935, just two years after the Nazis seized the power in Germany. They started the bunker underneath the dining room of the Old Chancellery since the New Chancellery was to be builded only in 1939.It was pretty much finished in 1942, just in time to face the massive Allied air attacks.Too bad thisvisual was not available in 2004 when Oliver Hirschbiegel made his film ""Downfall""(Der untergang in german)describing the final 12 days spent by Hitler in his bunker.The setting of the dictator's last hideaway would had been more accurate to reality. Since the real bunker was to be destroyed in 1989, this is your only chance to see what it looked like."
3,Nice size and weight; but very hard feel...,"The board is very light for its size and appears to be quite durable. And it's easy to clean.But it has a very hard feel--more like cutting on glass or granite than on a traditional wood or plastic board. If you do any chopping, it sounds like machine gun fire. And if you do slicing/rocking with a curved chef's knife, it's still has a pretty harsh feel. I still haven't used it long enough to judge whether it really doesn't dull knives any faster than wood--but I have doubts, given how it feels.Also, out of the box it had a horrible smell--like a wet dog wearing a wet wool sweater. But after a run through the dishwasher, it went away. Not sure if it will ever reappear (tho I note that Cook's Illustrated described the device as having a bad, lasting odor)."
4,Start with sharp knives!,"I've read other comments from the other Epicurean cutting surfaces reviewed here. Most give this product high praises...and a handfull do not.I like it, so far (two weeks at the time of this writing)...haven't had issues with marks or gouges, or an odd odor or warping as experienced by some. My theory (at least with minimizing marks/gouges) is that you need to have sharp knives when cutting/chopping your food on this product. The knife is supposed to do all the work, with minimal effort on your part. If you work through your food with ease, you minimize your forcing through the food, and thus avoid digging into your board. Look for a professional knife sharpening service and have your knives sharpened on occasion."
5,"So Far, So Good","I purchased this a month or so ago after researching for quite some time. I was originally considering a John Boos, but for the sake of size and storage, I choose this. I've been very happy so far, light weight, easy to clean, and has held up very well for using every day. I highly recommend."
1,It smells like formaldehyde,It works well as a cutting board but I am concerned about its smell?Has anyone else noticed this?
3,Comprehensive (though not original),"This book covers the basics of contemporary thought about time management. The author summarizes and explains many tips and tactics that are available elsewhere: however, if you only want to read one or two time management books, this one is better than many in the crowded genre. Some reviewers have complained about the format -- similar in layout to the ""Idiot's Guide"" and ""Dummies"" series -- but many readers find that headlines and sample quotes are easier to read and skim than more tightly packed text. I'm a Ph.D. psychologist who coaches academics and mid-career professionals, and for my work I've read dozens of time management books. This is a reasonable, although not stellar, addition to the pack."
2,Basic Information Spread Out Over 327 Pages,"My tip for time management is to skip this book. Assuming that one reads at about one page per minute, it's difficult to believe that one could recoup the five to six hours invested in reading this long-winded, tired, poorly written, poorly organized book in saved time. The time management pointers are very basic, and have been written about many times [this book is essentially a 'compilation' (to be polite) of past research]; the author (Marshall Cook) seems to 'borrow' liberally from many sources, and particularly from Stephen Covey's far superior '7 Habits of Highly Effective People'. I recommend '7 Habits' or Brian Tracy's 'Eat That Frog' -- a short (113 page), easy-to-read book that gives better information, but can be read in an hour or so."
4,"Solid, thorough material","This book was thoroughly reserched. By the way, Steven Covey didn't invent the urgent/important issue and therefore is not the primary source. Likewise for the Richard Carlson comments. The urgent/important issue appears in EVERY good time management book and at this point is common knowledge. There is much original material in this book. As a professional writer, I know the author didn't violate any laws, so don't worry about it."
5,101 salivations,"found a copy of this book at a thrift store, and showed it to a friend who loved it so much i bought her another from amazon. it didnt hurt that she has 2 great danes and there was one on the cover. [and another inside.] the photos are beautiful . i love the little dachshund she found on the beach and the photo is adorable."
5,beautiful book!,"My sister bought me this book as a gift a few years back, and I love it! I recently had a friend who's 17 year old dog died, so I bought it for her to help the healing process. She (and her children) loved it. It helped them to smile when they needed it. This book makes a great gift, and a great ""coffee table"" book. Rachael Hale is very talented."
5,Caring For My Mom-A Daughter's Point Of View.......,"The activities director at my mother's nursing home(Tn.) brought this author and his book's to my attention. The nursing home administrator is currently having the entire staff read this line of book's(The Eden Project). I ordered ""Life Worth Living"" and ""Learning From Hannah"", because I want to be a part of what will make mom's life and other's a better place to be. I started reading ""Life Worth Living"" and was honestly amazed about how educational this paperback really was. Not only is this book easy to understand, it's extremely interesting! I can only pray that some day all nursing home facilities realize how beneficial the ""Eden Project"" really is."
3,Very little critical examination,"I didn't hate this book, but Hart's agenda is very clear. I didn't feel he really presented any substantial reasons for his elevation of Scipio. As previously mentioned, he mostly just re-hashes the ideas of the ancient sources."
3,student study of roman history,"I found this book to be a perfect gift for a high school student who appreciates the ancient world and the things that can be learned from that past and used today.,"
3,overkill,"Unquestionably, Scipio was one of history's great commanders, and far too little of his fame has survived into the modern era. That being said, Liddell-Hart's relentless hagiography gets to be too much by the time the battle of Zama is over. Even accounting for the author's WW1 experience and disillusion with the military leaders of his time, his praise goes beyond admiration into sickeningly fawning adulation of the kind generally reserved for the cult of ancient emperors and modern dictators."
2,Frustrating dance steps for beginning to intermediate levels,"I normally really like Karen Voight's workouts. She gives great instructions and allows you to learn & gives different options for difficulty. Her videos are for serious exercisers. However, I am apparently somewhat inept in learning choreography. I got so frustrated that I quit the video. If you have reservations about tough choreography--this video is probably not for you."
1,Synthpop/futurepop dreck,"This album is nothing more than a catalogue of all of the synthpop/futurepop dreck that has been masking itself as goth and industrial music since the late 1990's. Having heard these bands played in clubs I can honestly say that I couldn't tell one from another. Why? Because ALL of them sound exactly the same.They have the same exact beats and same exact angst driven lyrics. I can see why some teens would like them, but if you are above the age of 30,like I am,they will most likely annoy you and make you want to bang your head against a wall.To those of you who have been calling this music goth please think again. In the 1980's there was a clear distinction between synthpop(Depeche Mode,Book Of Love,etc...) and goth(Christian Death,Sisters Of Mercy). Please don't confuse the two, because they are not the same."
5,An excellent compilation of the new wave in Gothic music.,"After purchasing this set at my local music store, I gave it a good few listenings over the next week or so. What I had heard exited my senses and introduced me to several artists new to me and familiar artists given a new look by talented musicians. I enjoyed the variety of different EBM, industrial, and darkwave sounds that enthralled my brain in an orgy of different sounds sensations. I would recomend this to anyone wanting to get into new Goth music, other than the tradional artists of days past."
1,Goth? I think not...,"Be not fooled by the hype...these are industrial-dance groups, for the most part, marketed as ""Neo-Goth"" to further dilute and corrupt what used to be something sacred and beautiful."
2,Read the books instead!,"Being a BIG Terry Pratchett fan doesn't change the fact that the animation is terrible, and the characters lack the details that make them Esme, Gytha and Magrat. All the subtleties are gone.The look of the witches is all wrong; Granny Weatherwax is not intimidating, Nanny Ogg is not naughty, and Magrat, for some reason, is sexy. Of course Christopher Lee is going to be brilliant for Death-- who else would you pick?! But if the rest of the visuals become painful to watch, and the witches are flat, then the video is a waste of time. Read the books!"
4,"bad animation, but faithful adaptation of WYRD SISTERS","This video is extremely faithful to the original novel, but the animation is primitive and Magrat's voice is an irritating monotone. (But Granny's voice is perfect) All that aside, it was such a pleasure to see Discworld brought to life that I'd recommend this to any other diehard Pratchett fans."
3,"OK, I guess","First, I really am a Pratchett fan. Maybe not a True Fan (note the capitals), but a fan. His writing reliably sparkles, even after dozens of volumes in the Discworld series, and delivers as much in its varied and memorable characters as in its plot. But, excellence brings with it one big problem: sustaining it.The witches were OK. Magrat had the proper combination of New Age enthusiasm and slightly scuffed self-esteem, and Granny Weatherwax came across as her stern self. Nanny Ogg bumbled a bit, for my taste, and the Mad Duke was just a bit over-the-top mad. Too much in some places, not enough in others, and more of a matte finish than the shine Pratchett leaves on his work. Other movie adaptations of the Discworld series (notablyHogfather,Going Postal, and especiallyThe Color of Magic) honor the books better.-- wiredweird"
4,"Good adaptation, not perfect, but still enjoyable.","Good adaptation of Prachett's novel. It's not 100% on the mark since at least 25% of Pterry's humor is in the footnotes, but still enjoyable. The voice talent was good, although Magrat's gurgle made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Christopher Lee IS Death, someone who I wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley. (Come to think of it, I'd rather not meet Death anywhere, but that's beside the point.) Well worth the money for the three-tape boxed collection."
3,Discworld Wyrd Sisters,"This is the full uncut animated series of Terry Pratchett's trio of heroines. The book upon which it's based is a tour de force of shakespearean allusions and laugh out loud gags. A shame, then, that the same cannot be said for this series. The casting seemed incredible: Annette Crosby (one foot in the grave) as Granny Weatherwax, June Whitfield as Nanny Ogg, Jane Horrocks as Magrat Garlick (both from Absolutely Fabulous). But their characterisation is limp and lifeless. To be fair, the animation is okay, with a nice CG turtle in the credits sequence. What really lets it down is the direction, which never seems to infuse the characters with the life they need, or the farce the story contains. Soul Music is a much better attempt."
4,Buy this or Granny will turn you into a toad,"Christopher Lee as Death. If for nothing else, this is worth owning.Good animation and character designs, keeps all the important plot points, and if you don't blink you'll see CMOT Dibbler and the Librarian. All told, a fine adaptation...now release Soul Music!And yes, Nanny sings the hedgehog song."
1,Too bad!,"I'm a HUGE Pratchett fan, own all the Discworld books, but this is just dreadful stuff. Poor drawing, poor animation, poor voice work, uninteresting music. Too bad, really. I bought both this and Soul Music, and wish I hadn't!"
2,Read the book!,"If you've read ""Wyrd Sisters,"" the book, then this DVD will be both more enjoyable and redundant. The animation is horrible, and the voices are too cartoony at times. If you've read the book, then you'll understand what's going on, but if you haven't, you'll be confused about a number of things. In short, skip the DVD and read the book."
3,"A great radio play, with a couple of pictures","I liked the performances, except sometimes Magrat was played a bit too young-sounding (nothing funny about a naive 14-year-old, but a naive 20-year-old....). They caught the flavour of the book very well.The animation is as bad as stated in many of these reviews---I'd rate the images about one step up from Rankin-Bass' ""Hobbit"", and the motion badly done for the most part (and the {PhotoShop filter}-like transitions and effects just plain irritating).Fortunately, someday the audio track can be married to a better rendering---perhaps with Leggos, if well-done those might be better...."
3,Garbled in translation,.... Most of the dialogue is hard to comprehend with the voice talent trying to make their larynxes stretch to cover the cartoon characters. (A noted exception is the Death character who would steal the show with more screen time.) Some humor comes through but kids will have a hard time sitting through its nearly 2.5 hour length.
4,A must-have for fans of Pratchett,"Extremely faithful adaptation. The animation, while not up to Disney standards, is excellent for a made-for-TV production. The brilliant Jane Horrocks is a standout as the voice of Magrat Garlick."
5,"I've got 3 words for this movie: ""This is GREAT!""","I know Discworld. And always enjoyed it. So when I heard this movie was at AMAZON, I couldn't believe it. I begged, pleaded, droped to my knees, asking mom if I could have it. SHE SAID YES! WOO-HOOOOOOO! Anyway, I watched it. But my VCR was screwed up, and didn't understand ther 3rd video. So I watched it again downstairs with my sister... And I was laughing so hard, I nearly fell of the couch. The cast is great (Well, Magrat's voice was just... BLAH!). No one can play Granny Weatherwax better than good ol' Annette Crosby. But now for the downside: The ending. What was the deal Verence II went in Magrat's house? But I loved this movie. I never read Harry Potter, due to Discworld. AND I'M PROUD OF IT! So... This movie gets 5 stars. Truly original!"
5,I don't regret buying this cd at all,"A lot of people that I have talked to about Arsis claimed that this was their worst album, nowhere near as good as Celebration of Guilt, so I was a bit skeptical of buying this cd. After seeing them last night in concert, I immediately bought this cd, and I have to say that this is FAR from being their worst. The songs are incredibly catchy, melodic, but brutal and unrelenting all at the same time. The only complaint I have with this cd is that it is WAY too short, but that's nitpicking at best. Arsis is by far one of the kinds of Melodic Death Metal these days, and this album proves that. I would recommend this for any fan of In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, At the Gates, and even some american bands such as Trivium, and Lamb of God. Don't waist your time! Get this now!"
3,Runny...,"I have been using patchouli based products and perfume for years, it's one of my favourite scents. I like the smell of the product, but I found it VERY runny coming out of the pump, almost like water. Now, I may have just gotten a bad container, but this was my experience."
2,didn't receive it,still waiting. correspondence with co. was good but no results why must I write more words??????? I said what I wanted to say......la la la la la la
3,Wasn't my flavor,"The story was a good creative story, but it just wasn't my flavor. The author is very descriptive with every detail and the descriptions became a little too much for me. I can understand wanting to describe surroundings and certain items like lamps and rooms and other various antique items, to a point, but it became cumbersome after awhile. I ended up skipping the ""descriptive"" paragraphs to move on to the paragraphs that had to do with the characters of the story. Others may enjoy this book though, it just wasn't for me."
3,Prisoner of my Desire,This book entertained me on the first few chapters. The story developed somewhat confusing at times. As I went through the following chapters I became restless due to the fact that the author started rambling about too many outside details that derailed from the main plot. It seemed to me to have too many chapters containing too little to do with the main characters and too much to do with the decorations of where they were staying. I will let readers decide on this one because as always there are different tastes for different foods. I personally do not recommend it as a great story. U be the judge this time.
5,Hold on tight - this book will humble you big-time!,"Charles Finney was an evangelist. As such, he saw the necessity to ""hang people over hell"" so that they saw the gravity of their lost condition. His words were strong. Whole crowds of listeners wept and repented as Finney spoke. This book is written by the master of evangelism, and the words here are no less strong than the words spoken to those in tent meetings long ago. In particular, the chapters on how to see if you are truly saved (versus thinking you are saved when, in fact, you are not) will make you search yourself and cry out to God to establish the right motives, the right spirit within you. Be prayerfully prepared before reading this, that the Lord will prepare your heart to receive what is inside this treasure."
5,Mandatory Truth for Transformation,"When I first got a hold of this ""historical book"" on Holiness it transformed my life and teaching and preaching. I remember the ""season"" that I was going through this material was in 1989. I was teaching and training former prostitutes on the mission field to become disciples of Jesus and preachers themselves. There was a noticeable change in the ""fruit"" of those attending my studies and in myself as well as I read and taught from this book. I am still teaching from this book over 24 years later (1989-2013)! I have seen measures of revival when I have combined the truths in this book concerning sin, holiness, repentance, and restitution with other resources similar. We believe in Clear Conscience Christianity and this resources hits the nail on the head concerning it."
5,Great show,"I discovered CSI Miami after its final season. There is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said - great cast, great stories. I plan to purchase all 10 seasons."
3,Crime drama with soap opera elements,"In the fourth season, CSI Miami began to deviate from the successful formula that they had developed in the first three. Some key elements were retained: the striking visuals, with sunlit exteriors, azure-blue ocean vistas, and pastel colors (reminiscent of Miami Vice). David Caruso's low key delivery projects a quiet strength. The major change was sub-plots about the personal lives of the characters, which tended to detract from main thrust of the story lines. The scripts were a bit uneven. There were some outstanding episodes, and some that were completely implausible. This series was always at its best when the scripts concentrated on plot and evidence, which unfortunately, was not always the case in the fourth season."
5,David Caruso - Still a Good Watch,"Nice to catch up on the fast paced, clever plots that I missed during the regular season due to the time the show is aired."
2,CSI-Please?!,"I occasionally watch CSI to point out the mistakes in the ""science"". I grew to enjoy the original series because the characters were done so well, even if the science is iffy. CSI-Miami, however, leaves a lot to be desired. A friend of mine bought this for me because I watch the original show. My problem with this show? 1st of all, if Eric Delco was working in a real lab and bought marijuana, he would have been fired!!! No questions asked or explanations accepted!! I hate Delco's character. He gets away with so much borderline behavior that this show becomes unrealistic. As a matter of fact, this entire lab would lose their accreditation and all of these labbies would be unemployed. Give me a break!!!"
3,Made to be cute,"I liked this dress set however, the skirt part is not a soft flowing cotton as is looks on-line. It's more of a stiff bed sheet (percale) material. I'd give it a 3 out of 5."
1,Let us listen...,Amazon ! Give us a chance to listen at least a little bit...I check fiew polish CDs and had no luck to listen anything.How can I give any ratings ???
2,Customer Service,"Not a good product. There are better options.One of the worst customer service companies that I have ever dealt with. Takes days for them to respond (if they bother), then their responses have been unhelpful.Never again will I do business with them."
1,Locks up and Won't Exit,"I ordered Audio Cleaning Lab 11. It worked for a while but after downloading an upgrade it would lock up and require me to power down my system because neither shutdown nor Task Manager could exit it. I am now using Audacity which is free. It doesn't have some of the features of Audio Cleaning Lab, but it works. Also, MAGIX tech support will not reply to my emails!"
4,Great product - lousy customer service,"I was ready to purchase fairly expensive, high-end authoring software for converting vinyl into CDs until I read a review on this product. While it is not 'no manual needed intuitive', it has incredible features and does an excellent job at cleaning up albums for conversion to CD and is a lot easier to use than other products I have demoed. My main complaint is that when I upgraded to the next version, I did not get the upgrade discount and after sending 3 emails to customer service not a one of them have been answered. I even posted a complaint on their forum and that went unanswered. Don't expect any customer service, but the product is worth considering - definitely."
5,Novice Comes Clean!,"I purchased this product to put 2 CDs together. I had never attempted something like this and was a total novice. Audio Cleaning Lab was terrific! I found it easy to understand and use, with unexpected options that improved the project I was working on. My one word to describe it--- simple....or maybe...effective...or maybe...straightforward...or maybe...uncomplicated...or maybe...useful...or maybe...valuable...or maybe..."
3,Magix Audio Cleaning Lab 11,"The product works okay. The specs said the ""de-esser"" was included in the software. It wasn't. I got an email after registering that said I could download it for free because I registered. Downloaded but cannot find where it is in the program when running it. Trying to get in touch with the home office [Germany] or the office in Miami is a joke. Have never been able to get the situation remedied . . . ever. Even called their office in Miami [toll call] and the girl that answered acted like she could care less and put me into a string of telephone push-button rigors that produced nothing."
3,Not the greatest quality or fit,It works and I'm glad someone makes this product. It isn't the best fit and the finish doesn't match the factory parts around it very well but it isn't too bad. It's far better than having to make your own adapter.
2,not a fan,I picked this up for my 94 silverado it was not what i wanted it doesnt work well with most stereos its not deep enough i bit the bullet and spent $4 more and picked up a better one.
1,Not for a Lid,"Although the product is described as being for a lid it is not.It dampens the lowering of a shelf (like a drop front desk I suppose) but is not for a lid as it does not support anything in an upward position.The labels, etc. with the shipped product do not use the word 'Lid' and have nothing to suggest it could be used to support a lid. The only reference to using it for a lid (e.g. toy box, blanket chest, etc) is the Amazon description.The low rating is simply a reflection of the product description, I have no reason to doubt that this item would be fine when used as intended.Alas, there was no picture on the page to show what this item looks like installed or the inaccurate description would have been apparent."
3,Leaves you wondering...,"Set on a ship sailing from England to Australia in the 1800's, Sarah is traveling in the unmarried women's section (in steerage) of the ship. With a tough matron to watch over them and nothing better to do, each girl tells a story of what they are running from and hoping to find. At the heart is Sarah, who believes she has a fish in her stomach and is made of salt water. She tells her story in broken bits, as part of the journey causes her to remember.I am really not sure what to think of this book. Sometimes, I think it is good, others, it seemed very poorly done. Christine Balint is more known for her short story work, and in my opinion probably should have stuck to it. ""Salt Letters"" is a good story, with vivid descriptions that pull you in and make you feel what is going on. But, the Balint has goes from each characters story, and back to Sarah's, the main character. The ending, well, it just ends, leaving you wondering what happened."
4,A life ends on land and begins on sea,"This book was one of the best I've ever read. I throughly enjoyed it and was very upset when it was over. Throughout the book, I wondered what it would be like to be in the girls shoes. To have to run away from a man whom her parents wish her to marry, and run off to Astralia of all places with her lover. It really made me sad to think that her love wasn't on the ship but happy to find out the secrets of the end. I especially loved how the author had her start letters to her family but never finish them, and then the resolve on how she came to fix that. I recomend this book highly to anyone intrested in historical fiction! I loved it!! I hope you do too!"
5,an extremely good book about modern physics,"this is an excellent book, from the beginning to the end. it introduces all the modern physics concepts with very clean explanations and beautiful colorful pictures. i just love it."
5,The ONE Best Book For Introducing Quantum Physics,"Not much more I can add to the title, actually. This is the ONE best single body of work for getting the basic introduction to quantum physics. It has the best explanations and it has, contrary to most of the other books on this subject, a lot of really helpful and interesting PICTURES. Might sound like a grade-school mentality, but I am certain that pictures make stuff easier to understand and more fun to read."
2,Text-heavy and not particularly insightful,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. I had expected a useful handbook on a series of widely used business and market analysis techniques. This book, however, is neither clear nor concise, and the 1980s vintage style graphics scattered throughout the book are not a particularly compelling summary of the rather wordy chapters. Keep looking."
2,Can't get past the print quality,"Although the content is actually pretty good, I just can't get over how cheap the quality is. It's one thing to have a paperback textbook, it's another to have coloring book quality pages, (no exaggeration) especially considering the price. I can't believe that Pearson Education actually puts their name on this."
1,PAthetic quality of the book,"No coments on the content, it's pretty good but,I just can't get over how cheap the quality of the book is I can't believe that Pearson Education is putting their name and also Amazon selling it....first the book is not the original it's a copied one, though we can read the content but the pictures, tables they are pathetic quality it's black-black everywhere. so the question arise is this book a value for money.....content wise yes but quality of the book is worst...i will say one star out of five is enough.Amazon must review, it's their brand value which is at stake."
5,Great Pitching Instruction,"Book gives technical background, instruction, and drills for pitchers. This is a must book for any pitcher."
3,SHORT DVD about planes,"Before you pluck down the cash you need to realize this thing is SHORT. Less than 40 minutes. It does cover some basics, very basic. The tuning portion of the presentation describes adjustment, not tuning. The blade preparation segment demonstrated how to sharpen a blade TWICE (once on a normal blade and one on a low-angle). You are practically shown the same thing again. Why? Time is precious when you only get 30+ minutes. I would have hoped he could have put more content in than show me this twice. I think most people would get alot more for the money from Garret Hack's ""Handplane"" book than from this DVD. The information Bird does share is solid. Just not nearly enough to make you a ""Master"" of handplanes as the title indicates.I was VERY impressed with Lonnie Bird's two books I have: ""Shaping Wood"" and ""Period Furniture Details."" That makes this purchase all the more frustrating."
4,Good cheap Gun,"Right off the bat I have to say that this is the cheapest gun with a metal gearbox that I have ever found, which automatically gets it a couple of stars there. For all of you first time buyers out there do not even consider getting plastic gears they'll break easy and jam easier. This gun also comes with 8k of bbs, which is convenient just because you don't have to pay extra shipping for another package. My only problem with this gun is the way the battery loads, its both hard to get out and get in so don't expect to do any battery switching in the middle of games unless you scrap the plastic around the barrel and just tape it on (something i'll probably end up doing.All in all though this is a great gun for the priceI highly recommend it"
5,This is the best gun ever thats under $100,"Ok this gun is really nice. Its better then my friends guns which are tokyo murai, Echo 1, classic army and many more types. I honestly think that this is the best gun under $100 dollars. Also this is a really realible company. I woop my friends in airsoft and trust me they are no noobs. Ive had this gun for about 1 year and it still hasent broke.Pro's....330 fps with 0.20g.metal gearboxthe plastic is really durablebattire lasts a long time if you charge it for about 6-7 hoursreally accurate out to a distance just like the real thingfast rate of fire, 11-12 shots per second on a full batterieshoots about 200-225 ft. awayI would probably buy this gun again when it breaksit feels like the real thingCon's....gets cold battrie in the winterand doesnt work as welland thats about it:)P.S. use 0.20g for this gun dont use 0.12g it will shot 2 per everytimeyou pull the trigger even though they are more expensive:)"
3,Problems with this gun!!!!,"I just bought this gun 3 days ago, and I am already trying to return it to Hot Import Toys. When I got the gun the front sight was put on bent, the back sight was chipped, and the stupid thing wouldn't shoot because there was a frayed wirer!!!! I have to admit the gun looked and felt great, but still I paided allot of money for this and to have it shiped to me broken make me very depressed. I hope Hot Import toys will let me return it for a new one.From Robyn K."
1,DON'T BUY THIS GUN!!!!!,I just got this gun yesterday and the gearbox aready got messed.i havent even gotten to shoot 100bb bullets.when i got this gun it was cool until it got messed up.dont buy this gun even if it was so cheap.the gun is made up of very cheap thing.!!!!!!!
1,Luminary Does Not Work,"I purchased this product for my Mom. She loves dragonflies and is constantly in the yard, so I thought this would be a nice addition. The battery in one of the luminaries could not be placed in because of the soldering which protruded out directly above where the battery needed to be placed. Most disappointing, is that the other luminary (which I could get the battery in) doesn't even work, meaning it does not light up. Lastly, the product arrived quite poorly and unprofessionally packaged. If I purchased this for myself I guess it would be ok, but I'm disappointed because I truly wanted my Mom to enjoy this."
5,already seeing results after one month!,"This is a fantastic tape. This workout really works your entire upper body. My back, arms and abls are all visibly tighter, and my posture has greatly improved. I'm very glad I found this tape. I have never gotten any results with my arms before. Ms. Voight takes each exercise slowly, so you get the full benefit of each movement. I've used tapes where they do everything too quickly for it to do any good.By the way, you don't need a step if you can improvise with your equipment a little. I chose to buy an incline board instead and my workout room has a step."
1,Misleading,"Her instruction may be very good but this was filmed in the early 1990's. I ordered this video under the impression it was filmed within the past few years (release date: 2002). However, the packaging of the video box was simply updated. I also didn't realize that I would need a step or bench to complete the workout. Just know what you are ordering!"
3,Karen Voight Lite,I have a lot of Karen Voight workouts and love her style. And I only consider myself in the intermediate level of exercising. But even doing both 40-minute workouts together barely raised a temporary sweat and I didn't feel like I was working any muscle groups in a way that would lead to results. Karen's Great Weighted Workout is a much better overall workout that gives you results after about two weeks of consistent use.
2,"A Book that looks appealing, but is inaccurate.","At first glance, REA looks like the best choice in AP Chemistry- after all, it has 6 practice tests. But most of the sample questions don't reflect how the real test is like. You don't find complex logarithms on an AP Chem test, and ETS won't be nice enough to ask you which elements are considered Alkali Earth Metals. Avoid this book! It costs more than most other AP Chem tests. Instead, try the comprehensive Princeton Review AP Chemistry. REA may be good at covering AP history topics, but when it comes to science, try another brand."
2,Okay,"I received the correct earpiece and holder for the Z500a cell phone, but the car charger that was in the package was incorrect. It was for Motorola V Series phones. I was not happy with this delivery overall, but the other equipment worked fine."
1,Three-Piece Value Combo Pack for Sony Ericsson Z500a,The Cigarette lighter adapter is OK but the Hands free earbud is noisy and the Leather carrying case is almost useless.
3,works for certain phone models! especially the car charger!,not for Sony Ericsson Z520a like i thought.
4,Informative history of a great childhood memory,"I grew up in the 60's and 70's and spent some time every summer at Wildwood. Those were great times and the book brought back many fond memories. It also provided a lot of history I would not have otherwise known about. The pictures are great and plentiful but there is also a lot of text to enjoy. The book covers the history of Wildwood by the decades (each chapter dedicated to a decade or 2) and each chapter is further broken down by subject (i.e., land development, amusement pier development, vendors, beach, entertainment, etc.) I was a bit disappointed, however, that it did not cover the past 20 years as deeply as it covered the previous decades. If you're interested in NJ history, this book is a great read, a wonderful keepsake, and a classic coffee table book."
1,I Wouldn't Pay Actual Money For This Pen.,"When I was a secretary for two years, I received this pen in the mail exactly eight times. The supply company we ordered from (only one time) sent the pen samples in an attempt to entice us to order more. But all of their pens sucked, and this one was no different. Its barrel size makes any attempt at writing anything unwieldy and difficult at best. The ink flow is comparable to a .29 cent Bic. Additionally, the pen itself is cheaply put together, and comes apart after only a few uses. We couldn't give these away; even our customers, who love free stuff, wouldn't take them."
4,Biblical guide to the green earth,Scharper and Cunningham present some of the key concepts that are found in the bible. They use quotes from many authors as well as bible passages to develop their concepts. Their introductory words invite one to read further and initiate the thought processes. This book is useful to those who need some green inspiration or need a few quotes to liven up a presentation or conversation.
3,good set,"I got this for my girlfriend for Christmas and it is a nice set and does the job, however there are 30 hair rollers and only 16 clips to hold them in place. Not sure if this was specified in the description but is very disappointing. I think for as much as the set cost it should have been complete."
2,Not based on facts!,Very average movie- I quickly got bored with it.This movie is not based on facts.The real racing footage is the only highlight of the movie.It is really about the romance between Shirley Temple's character and the jockey.
2,"For Shirley Temple, not Seabiscuit, fans.","This movie trades on the name Seabiscuit, but isn't really about the famous horse. Buy it if you want to see a Shirley Temple movie. Wait for the movie based on Laura Hillebrand's book to see the real story of Seabiscuit."
3,"Pretty average film, but Temple is good.","I was curious to see Shirley Temple as a young woman, and was pleased to find that she retained the confidence and charm that she displayed in the movies she made in her childhood. Her character comes to America from Ireland, but has a mysteriously inconsistent brogue; not entirely a surprise to me, but she does a nice job with the role. In ""The Story of Seabiscuit,"" Temple is a young nurse whose uncle is a horse trainer--but she hates horse racing because her only brother died as the result of a fall in a horse race.The plot is entirely predictable: boy meets girl, girl hates boy, boy woos girl, boy wins girl, but the footage of actual horse races makes the film a bit more interesting than it would be without it.If you're a Shirley Temple fan (and who wouldn't/couldn't be?!), you will want to see this because Shirley is her sweet, pretty self. Don't expect any singing or dancing, however, as this is not the vehicle for that."
3,A Gallant Horse And A Crafty Trainer,"THE STORY OF SEABISCUIT is a fairly entertaining family movie inspired by the racing career of a legendary horse. The film is mostly about the fortunes of a horse and his trainer (Barry Fitzgerald). For background there is a romance between the trainer's niece (Shirley Temple) and Seabiscuit's jockey (Lon McCallister).Fitzgerald is very much in his element and obviously enjoys his role. Temple is stiff and awkward with her attempts at imitating an Irish brogue. McCallister does a good job in one of his last appearances before his premature retirement from the industry in 1953.The plot is predictable with tension buiding up to the final race. Actual film footage of Seabiscuit racing provides a big bonus.David Butler also directed ROAD TO MOROCCO, APRIL IN PARIS, A CONNECTICUT YANKEE and BRIGHT EYES."
3,"A Nice Shirley Temple Movie, not so much for Seabiscuit fans","Although the name of Seabiscuit is used, this movie is pure fiction. Shirley Temple stars as Margaret O'Hara, a comely Irish lass who is partial to a racehorse owned by her uncle, and falls in love with the jockey. Despite the liberties taken with the plot, there is some wonderful archival footage showing the real Seabiscuit in action (a race at Pimlico against War Admiral, and in 1940's Santa Anita Handicap).Staci Layne Wilson"
4,All Star Marriott Tribute,"Can't believe that No one has reviewed this excellent tribute footage from 2001 to rock icon Steve Marriott who passed away in a house fire in 1991. Amoung those in attendance and contributing:High Lights:Paul Weller and Noel Gallagher: Tin SoldierSteve Ellis who sounds alot like Marriott doing ""Afterglow"" with the Mods""Here Come the Nice"" with Kenny Jones, Ian McLagan, Paul WellerReformed Humble Pie running through ""Shine On"", ""Four Day Creep"" among many other Pie numbers.All in all 1 DVD set that should be in everyone's collection alongside their Small Faces, Humble Pie collections!"
3,wonderful fictional story,really wonderful but i m an english learner so basically i found it hard because of very mythological terms they used. In spite of the whole story had a very amazing creativity thinking.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Writer's block needs a dream fix.Here, de Lint's protagonist is an author. The chance one of his major characters is an egineer or a football player, or a lawyer would seem to be pretty remote. :)She is having problems writing, as it seems that in the past all her ideas came in the form of dreams. This, of course, is somewhat magical, and she has been cut off from this source by your bad man type.So, a bit of dream world adventuring to be done to stop the bad guy, help some magic types, and actually get some words down."
1,Horrible,"I probably would have loved this item and I know my husband would have if I would have ever received it. Seeing as how it was a christmas present, I was extremely upset when I didnt get to give it to my husband. Now here I am a month later and still haven't gotten it! I will never again order something that comes from Fansedge!!!"
5,Works Great,"I purchased this cable to replace (a brand new dvi) cable from another company that did NOT work. Where the other cable caused constantly flickering/switching between Dvi/analog, this cable does Not. It works great, high quality, heavy duty and was received in a very timely fashion. Kudos"
5,Supports 2560 x 1600,"If you are looking for a DVI cable for a display with 2560 x 1600, look no further. After trying a few cables, this worked with my Dell U3011. The cable looks almost the same as what I got with the display (color, material and markings on the cable)."
1,Tripp P560-010 cable,The cable that was sent to me was a DVI single link TDMS cable? The pin pattern (24 pin) does not match the picture either?The one I received is only 18 pins & says single link cable on package?
3,Works as advertised.,It's a cable - there is not much to say about it beyond that. At least it works as expected.
4,Great addition to the Police Officer K-9 GI Joe,"My son was nuts about the GI Joe he got for his birthday, but the accessories added to the joy. Everything is fairly durable considering its small size. I considered them sort of educational on account of my son having an opportunity to learn what these tools in law enforcement are used for."
4,Works as it should,I'm a fan of how these lotions smell and how they feel on the skin. It works just fine for me though I prefer a lesser SPF for my tan.
3,The Quest for the Holy Grail,"The Quest for the Holy GrailThe Light Beyond the Forest by Rosemary Sutcliff had an extremely interesting plot. The reader follows the quest for the holy grail in four different characters. Sutcliffe jumps back and forth between the quests of Sir Percival, Sir Bors, Sir Galahad and Sir Lancelot.The time of the setting is in the medevil age. It takes place in many locations throughout the story. There are a few suspenseful twists that will keep you waiting until the end. Throughout the quest many conflicts appear between the characters and the grail.Finally, I would recommend this book for 13+. Although it is not very long it can be confusing and hard to understand at times. This book is great for adventurous readers because of its plot and conflicts"
1,"So, so booooring....","Maybe it just wasn't my ""cup of tea"", but I found this book to be mind-numbingly boring as I read it to my 10-year old daughter as a bedtime book. She wasn't too impressed either, but once we start a book we generally finish. (I'm a 44 year old dad)I didn't care about any character in the book or any of their meaningless spiritual adventures. The story, like the knights on the grail quest, just seemed to wander around lost for 130 pages until it was time to cross the ""T""s and dot the ""I""s on the anti-climactic finish.Its shocking to me that this book has a 3-1/2 star rating on Amazon since it is one of the worst I've read (and I've read hundreds over the years to my kids)Maybe if you are a Renaissance Fair Junkie-Type who is all into knights, the grail and Catholicism you might find this passable (if you can stand reading the word ""hermitage"" 200 times), but I think most rational people will find this book boring with a capital B and pointless with a capital P."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Sutcliff's Arthurian trilogy is definitely some of her better work. Thegrail quest is the focus of this work, with several knights going theirseparate ways to try and find it.Many mystical and supernatural encounters are had along the way, asthe knights see if their religious qualifications are good enough forthem to succeed in their journey."
1,fails to deliver for the truly concerned,"For this reader, ""Human Values in a Changing World"" proffers ineffectual discourse and prosaic insights into the many ethical dilemmas facing society today. The sections on responsibility and ethics were especially didactic and narrow in scope, all but evading such weighty issues as the seperation of Church and State (much to the relief of co-author Daisaku Ikeda, I would expect).For those truly concerned about the role of religion in society and are looking for answers to the many ills facing society today, I recommend reading Hans Kung's ""A Global Ethic"" which lists four ""irrevocable directives"": commitments to a culture of nonviolence and respect for life; of solidarity and a just economic order; of tolerance and a life of truthfulness; and of equal rights and partnership between men and women -- all areas where ""Human Values in a Changing World"" fails to deliver."
1,Worthless,"This dishwashing wand is worthless. Cheaply made, it leaked detergent from both ends almost from the start. I bought two and threw them out within days."
1,Major Disappointment,"This DVD is advertised as Swing Era - Benny Goodman. Be advised that there are only two BG tracks on the DVD. They are both excerpts from a 1937 movie ""Hollywood Hotel"" yet the DVD does not even use the two best songs from that movie (Sing,Sing,Sing and a number by the BG Quartet). There are five Artie Shaw tracks - four from a movie short and the other from a Fred Astaire movie. There are eight Jimmy Dorsey tracks - five from a movie short and three from ""soundies"" that were produced to play on Panoram machines. There are five Hoagy Carmichael tracks (how did he get in there?) backed up by Jack Teagarden that are all taken from a movie short. Finally, there are ten tracks of a Jack Teagarden dixieland group that were produced as Snader Telescriptions. Snaders were made between 1950 and 1954 -long after the swing era was over and long after Big T was past his prime. The producers of this DVD are guilty of false advertising.Dick Goodman (unfortunately no relation to Benny)"
1,The Treasure,"This is the classic ""chick book"" The mystery of love and romance overshadow the goofy search for treasure. Real men..stay away."
2,Product doesn't fit all Carex walkers and be aware of return policy,This basket does not fit all Carex walkers. Be aware of the vendor's return policy and restocking fees in the event item is returned.
3,Couldn't wait,The first time I read this book it was only available in Paperbook - it's a quick and compelling read - with absolute must read sequels that were unavailable at the time. I was so excited to see the entire series available on kindle. Kit Shannon is truly an interesting character - her interactions with the famous Earl Rogers really grabbed my interest. Also contained a unique view on law that increased my respect for the systems we have in place.
2,Kit Shannon is not believable,"I read this trilogy because I loved James Scott Bell's ""Breach of Promise."" I finished all three books mainly because I wanted something clean to read, but I was very disappointed. The legal angles are intriguing, but as the books went on it became harder and harder to take Kit Shannon seriously. Can Peterson really expect us to believe that a person could come out of nowhere to singlehandedly transform the LA legal scene, take on William Randolph Hearst, have tea with the President, and debate the Bible with Clarence Darrow?! That's just too much for me to buy, and I'm sorry to say I cannot recommend this series. People who want to read legal dramas that are both clean AND artistic will need to look elsewhere."
2,A brief overview,"This book looks at healing from a biblical perspective. It is divided into three sections that are titled: ""The Biblical Perspective"", ""The Problem of Magic"" and ""Life, Death, Disease and Healing"". Some of the illustration are out of date and the author tends to be verbose."
3,boring with a capital B,He goes on and on and on about abortion. my God!!!!!!!!! How many times do you have to pound it in? I did not finish reading the thing.
1,Charlatan,"There may be odd bits of fact scattered here and there throughout this work, but I'm afraid this man is a charlatan."
4,It is aging well,"Though the first time I heard this, it sounded too much like Sid Barrett from Pink Floyd, but there are other influences too.It does seem to be standing in some aesthetic dignity, and it makes U want to play guitar.Though Blur split up, and Gorillaz was formed, this reassuringly does not try to impress.Life goes on...and for u."
3,I'm docking stars mainly for price,"The product is what it is, except it's a LOT more expensive than if I were to buy it at a store.So, if you're truly lazy to go out into a CVS, Vons, or Ralphs to get a bottle, order it online.Otherwise you'll be jipped a few bucks AND it's the SMALL size."
2,Could be better.,Leaves oily residue. A lot of it. Needs more than just one swipe to take off all of your makeup. Goes easily on your skin.
3,It's not Lancome!,"I didn't want to spend $30 on the Lancome product so I tried this one. While it says oil-free, it's anything but. First, you can see the oil IN the bottle. The product has a line in the middle of the bottle where the 2 don't mesh..like oil and water... Second, you can feel it when you go to soap up your eyes. Yes it's a lot cheaper...but worth it???? Not if you don't like the oily feeling!!!"
4,Best Drugstore Remover!,"I think this is the best drugstore eye makeup remover on the market!I've tried Almay Eye Makeup Remover Pads (Almay Eye Makeup Remover Pads, Oil Free, 80-Pads), but it was not as good as this Neutrogena remover. Keep in mind that Almay pads was Allure Magazine's Best of Beauty Award Winner.Neutrogena's remover easily removes waterproof mascara without irritating my eyes, which Almay's didn't quite do. The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that your eye area is still left with makeup residue after using the remover. You need to use the remover specifically to remove eye makeup before cleansing your face. I hope Neutrogena comes up with a new remover that not only moisturizes eyelashes but also helps eyelashes grow longer, stronger & healthier!"
1,Boy what a rip off,"Listen, people might think this is dragon ball z but this is not dragon ball z. This is a bunch of edited bull-crap, completely slaughtered by funimation. Trust me, i'm a true dragon ball z fan, and this is no kid show."
5,its the greatest dragonball z moive i have ever seen,dbzdbzdbzdbzdbzdbzDBZDBZDBZDBZDBZ IIISSS TTHHEE gggggggrrrraaattttteeessssssstttttt!!!!!!!
3,From a bird lover,This book has some great tips and information for bird feeding. Unfortunately the same information is repeated over and over. A smaller book could have easily included all information.
4,Haven't used it yet,Haven't used it yet. Saving for an emergency. I will post a full review when I have a chance to use it.
3,Not sure about these ventvisors,The right side back passenger in channel visor continue to slip out of place when i open and reclose that back window. It does not always allow that window to return to it full closed position. Have to use finger to pull shade back and and allow window to fully close. Very annoying
4,Satisfied Customer,"Eastman Outdoors Whole Enchilada Professional"" Outdoor Cooking Set.It was easy to put together, always a plus. Deciding to purchase the complete set, accessories included, made it easy to attempt our first deep fried turkey. No need to make do with kitchen utensils. The special price was indeed, special. We would recommend this particular fryer, especially if you can get it at this price."
5,Very professional and sturdy construction!,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it! We deep fried a turkey on Christmas day and it turned out great thanks to this professional cooker. It brought the temperature of the oil up in no time, and maintained 350 F with no problem. It took a little while to put together, but once we did, it had a very sturdy construction and we felt completely safe while using it. Because of the ease of temperature stability, the turkey turned out golden brown on the outside and deliciously moist on the inside. There's no way we'll be able to wait for another holiday to use this again! Great product!"
5,Best Turkey Ever,"I bought one this year for Thanksgiving. I was a little nervous about the sturdiness of the product after unpacking it. Once I assembled it (easy) I was pleasantly surprised. It is sturdy and I wasn't worried about it tipping over. It comes with everything you need except the propane tank. The picture doesn't show the regulator and hose but it's included. The burner is strong and heats the oil to temp in about 10 min. The large pot looks too samll to fit a large turkey but we fit a 16lb turkey with room for more. (the booklet lists 18lbs as the limit) It only took 55min to cook and used somewhere around 3 gallons of peanut oil. We bought the 5gal box from the local wholesale club for about $25 and didn't use all of it so 3gal is my guess. Can't wait for summer now to use this for lobster, crab legs, steamers, corn....."
3,FYI: NOT Italian Stainless Steel as advertised in review,"Seemed like a fairly good set, only very disappointed to find that it was NOT 18/8 Italian stainless steel, as stated in Mr. Olson's official review. It is instead, Chinese aluminum."
4,Good Value,"This cooking set was on sale and even with shipping beat the ""best"" prices locally. I gave it to my son as a gift, and he was thrilled to get it. It included the pots, lids, lifter that were also good quality. Very nice set. Good quality/good value."
4,It can do it all!,"This cooking set is great!We assembled it in record time!It works better than we expected, the only disappointment was that it was missing the three screw assemblies that were needed for the handle assembly for the small colander (A metal coat hanger stood in for the first use).Great buy, very useful!"
3,good deal.,I Have used this cooker tons of times. The only problem I have had is the fryer basket handle is painted and the paint came off in the fryer the first time I used it. I removed all the paint from the handle with a wire wheel and have had no problems since. Works good.
2,Not up to par,Don't buy is a waste of money. Need to check other ones from Academy. Just to hard to get handled and needs great supevission
3,Relative poor,"This should have been a gem to own and study. BUT it is poorly layedout and HAS NONE OF THE DIAGRAMS REFERRED TO! Why why do that? If you, the publisher, want sell this sort of valuable text why not at least make it a complete copy. Disappointing. The content is of fine."
4,I think it is a really good single overall.,"This single is great for listening and dancing. I brought it to our school dance, and you have no idea how popular it is. Even now, about two months after it was released, it is really cool. GET THIS NOW!!!"
5,It was Excellent!!,I love that song. It was great. Mya and Blackstreet put a lot of effort into their song. I always hear it on the radio and on MTV. Everybody talks about it. BUY THE SINGLE FAST!!!!
5,Good ol' Arnold,"This figure is beautiful. No blood, no bull. Just plain Arnold in the way he's supposed to look. The figure's as stiff as a T-850 cyborg so it lives up to it's name. It's in a perfect display pose and a must add to your collection. Forget the other Terminator figures, this one goes in the list 1st!"
3,a learning experince,These books are good but are lacking in explanations on how they get some of their answers. I even used a school text book and could not come up with the right answers on some of the problems. If you are looking to get extra practice on your Alg. work they are a good resource. Teachers do not let the kids get a hold of your answer books that is the only key you have some times.
4,"Great series, easy to use for parent/teachers, a few mistakes though","There are a few mistakes in this series, I will admit that. I don't get tooo crazy about them, as there are very few and if my kids don't agree with an answer, we find it together.These are easy to use, and I can tell you that's true because I hate algebra! The moment I learn something (again) about it, the new information goes right out of my head. My kids, however, are really getting it. There is gradual new information, there is just enough repetition.I highly recommend their other sets as well!My book:Whispers Of AngelsA Knight In Glendalough (The Aerleah Series)"
4,Some audio flaws on this set??,"Another great set from Jello, 3 discs of impassioned ranting-- as always, he offers SOLOUTIONS to the problems he talks about. I admire his thoughts and opinions greatly.I've noticed many ""drop-outs"" on this set, instances where the audio just drops-out during a word. I don't know if this is present on the original/master tapes, or if I just have a faluty pressing, but be aware that this exists on at least one copy.Overall if you are looking for a tonic to the ills that surround us daily, a soothing balm to the constant stream of bullsh** coming at us from both the White House and the 'official' media... give this a spin or two. Listening to this might just convince you that you're NOT alone, and NOT insane."
3,Solid but not necessarily fresh material.,"Or maybe I just came to this too late. But it feels a bit like a rehash. But if you ever get the chance to see him speak live, do. He's a lot of fun and really sharp. He's bombastic, sure, not exactly Mr. Subtlety and Humility but very sharp."
3,I've Heard This All Before,"All right, I love Biafra, I love his ranting. But this time around, I wasn't more than 20 minutes into the first disc when I started thinking hey, I've heard this before. Hell, I've thought this before. I mean the material created itself--Biafra just had to get the order and the delivery straight. I'm looking forward to the next spoken word (which hasn't been announced) that will (I hope) bridge the gaping maw between the topics covered on Treason to now."
3,Rant-o-Rama (Invasion of the Geek Patrol),"Hi. I'm Jello Biafra, former Dead Kennedys frontman.I haven't had many original musical ideas since ""Frankenchrist,"" so I whine and harangue about evil Republicans for hours on end so that people will think I'm still important."
4,A great box set albeit a bit pricey,"If you grew up in the 70s you remember Schoolhouse Rock. Those little three minute cartoons really grew on you. My daughter is 9 and she loves this set... we listen to it in the car all the time. I have two small gripes, though: as other reviewers have noted this is not the entire collection. There are four Money Rock songs that are only available on the Best Of Schoolhouse Rock disc. Also, this four disc set would fit on two discs with room to spare (even with the additional four Money Rock songs). Spreading it over four compact discs smacks of gouging and that kept me from giving it five stars. But it is a great set and there's nothing quite like it. Recommended if you have kids (they'll dig it) or were a child of the 70s."
5,I Made a Mistake!!,"I bought the first 3 audio CD's individually and I absolutly LOVE THEM!! I wish this four disc set were available when I made my purchases. Not only do they bring back great memories of those Saturday mornings in my childhood, but perhaps it was ABC's free version of today's ""Hooked on Phonics"" and even today is a great teaching tool. This set even has extra songs that my individual CD's do not, I'll not buy this set now, but you can bet if something should happen to my 3 discs (heaven forbid) it'll be at the top of my shopping list!!"
5,Great Book,Great book for new sewers. I've bought it as gifts for my sewing students who range from third grade to sixth grade. Very good illustrations.
2,Disappointed,"I got this book for my 8-yr old granddaughter for Christmas because she has expressed interest in sewing. However, I was disappointed in the projects put forth in this book. Expecting a beginning seamstress to do buttonholes or zippers is not realistic in my opinion. There are a few projects that are very simple, but basically useless items. I think the author could have done better."
5,Great for Beginner,"This is an uncomplicated sewing instruction booklet that is great for the beginner. Basic sewing instructions provided in simple language and illustrations that allow the beginner to get started right away on sewing a simple project (instructions for simple, basic projects included in booklet). Very pleased with this!"
1,not what I want.,It does't have much information about hand sewing and projects in the book are not what I want. Choose other books. There are lots of choices.
3,Great (BIG) Bowl,Much as I love my Winterberry collection I didn't read the dimensions of this bowl well and it is much too big for my space and needs. Will be a great Wassail Bowl.
2,Good...but in my opinion...,"I really enjoyed the book...for awhile. I applaud the author in his explanation of the book's style in the preface. But I could NOT finish the book. Perhaps I should have researched the author in advance. I have been a P.E. teacher and coach in California for over 30 years. I don't allow some of the language that the author used in the locker room. I'm sure the mountain men were quite capable of ""colorful (to me offensive)"" language as well as behavior with women that isn't very nice.Do we really need to capture this seamy side of their lives? I think not. Again, I'm sure the author is more successful than I would ever be. The book has been around for awhile. I just wish it didn't have some of the tiresome words than also seem to be more prevalent in our TV and movies, etc.Agan, my fault for not researching more. Hopefully, this may help someone else."
2,Klemperer on Qualuudes,"Klemperer's Zauberflote is likely the most wonderful opera on record. I thus looked forward to this with great expectation, especially with Geraint Evans - a formidable voice - and Elisabeth Soderstrom - Swedish beauty. Unfortunately, from the first downbeat to the end of Act 2 nearly 100 minutes later there is absolutely nothing but plodding, lifeless noise. Reri Grist's voice is especially cloying. Let's just say Klemperer's stick is flaccid and the ensemble never gains momentum. To represent Mozart's nobility with any meaning requires pace, spontanaeity, and surprise - all absent here and obviously the reason this set is out of print and frankly out of breath."
4,Time Capsule,"Swiss Movement is that most precious artifact: Something that is both completely of its time and of all time. If (heaven help you) you wonder whether there was more to the period we've come to call The Sixties than Jerry Garcia and Grace Slick, you owe it to yourself to check out Les McCann singing ""Compared To What?"" When it first came out, Playboy Magazine (uh, they put on a jazz festival as well as show pictures of nekkid wimmen) called it ""rock and roll disguised as jazz."" Hey, whatever. It grooves. And the secret weapon of this session is the amazing trumpet/cornet of Benny Bailey. His work on ""Cold Duck Time"" is not an acquired taste--you take to it right away. Also dig the late Leroy Vinnegar aka The Tennessee Walker on bass--he's right there, every cut."
4,soul-jazz pleaser,"I have to admit that I never heard this entire album until recently. I'd heard ""Compared To What"" countless times --- great, great tune --- and a few Eddie Harris tracks, and a couple of Les McCann albums, but never this concert with the two of them together. Well, it's as good as hyped. Maybe not a life-changing classic, but still a fiery, fine, fanstastic recording. No, it's not pure jazz, but I'm no purist, so this soul-jazz fusion suits me just fine. Excellent musicianship, passionate singing, and a festive atmosphere combine to make this one a total pleaser."
4,A great classic!,"This is a great old record, really swinging jazz from the Montr5eux Jazz festival. One of my favorites from college days. Strongly recommend this."
2,Don't Buy!!!,"The CD is great if you like the sounds of bloated cattle slipping a disc while moo-ing. The first track is the only one on the CD worth having... can you say, ""download""?"
4,Good quality and helpful for working on cars!,"I purchased this creeper years ago and it is still working fine. It is made of strong galvanized metal tubing, thick plywood for the base, strong rubber casters for the wheels and the foam the padded top is covered with heavy duty red vinyl. I have not had any problems with it and it is particularly suited for brake jobs on cars, detailing, prepping for paint or anything you would normally have to sit on the ground to work on. The only downside of this design in that there isn't any back support but there are others creepers out there for that issue. For the price and heavy duty construction it can't be beat! Stop working on the ground and get to work! Also fun for creeper races in the shop!"
1,awful product,When I purchased the low boy I tought I would get an entire creeper for my husbands fathers day gift. Low and behold I got a wheel from a creeper in an empty box!!! I contacted the seller twice and he still has not sent me the creeper. Needless to say I have canceled his payment through my credit card company. Thank goodness for credit cards or I would be out $[...] for a wheel. What a scam!!!!!
4,"Great Guest Stars, Weird Ending, Ok Season","Ok so the final season of Roseanne may not be the highlight of the long running series, but it is the final season and it deserves it's time in the sun along with the rest. In 1996-1997 we find the Connors as lottery winners, David and Darlene a married couple with a baby on the way, and Dan and Roseanne on the outs. It is a long,strange trip they were on but it ends in a way no one could forsee. Some love the final moments of the final episode and others hate it, but it ties up some loose ends, and it's Roseanne's way of rectifying a lackluster season, and catch a glimpse at what her life could have been had she never made it big. If nothing else this season is a must see for the long list of guest stars in wacky, far out roles. All in All good series, ok season."
1,Ridculous.,"Roseanne - The Complete Ninth Season is absolutely awful. This was the last season and thank god for that! Every episode is campy, strange, and unfunny. I loved Roseanne seasons 1-7 (season 8 wasn't that hot either) she really had a groundbreaking show, don't buy this season, you'll thank me later."
1,Not the shows you saw on television,"I bought this dvd for the sole purpose of watching 'The Miracle', the birth of Darlene's baby. At the end of the program, as the infant fights its way back from near death, the song 'Blackbird' by the Beatles was used as the soundtrack for her recovery. Not on this dvd. Licensing issues apparently forced the tune from the audio track! It's ridiculous that the only way to see the sequence as intended is on broadcast tv."
3,The Order,"The DVD was ordered as a gift so it is still under the tree. As far as the order process, billing and shipping = thumbs up!Love Roseanne so can't imagine there will be any level of disappointment."
2,roseanne season 9,This was a disappointing ending to the series.. the story line went all over the place.. It was basically rubbish. Having collected the whole series i felt purchasing the last season to be a waste of money:The ending was not done well at all with Roseanne just sitting and talking:Not a purchase i would recommend
1,Avoid this season like the plague!,"I was a kid when Roseanne was on the air, and I found it boring. About a year ago, maybe longer, I started watching the episodes on TV land. I found a new appreciation for the humor on the show and found myself intrigued and catching up with the characters and enjoying the dysfuncional family dynamics.Found myself watching the final episode of the show, and when I say the biggest, and most offensive end to a show I've ever seen, that's exactly what I mean. What an insult to our intelligence. I won't reveal here, but it felt like a complete ""screw you"" to the viewers. The show was obviously in syndication when I saw this, but I did vow to never watch another repeated episode of Roseanne again, and I've maintained. It was so utterly ridiculous.The only benefit I see of this dvd is that you've seen the last season and had no qualms about how the show ended."
1,If you love Roseanne don't watch series 9. RIP,"As a collector of all the Roseanne series I recently pruchased season 9 to round things off. I wish I had never known it existed. It took a lot of will power just to sit down to watch it, so over the top, so unreal, not at all the family situations that made us love the Conners. Lost all sense of story, reason, or purpose. It's not just indulgent on the casts part, but it doesn't care if it entertains the audience at all. The writers must have all quit at the end of season 8. This is not the Roseanne that should have been. The ending, explained away that it was just a book Roseanne was writing and that Dan had really died the year before and that all this fantasy was just that wasn't good enough to bring back the hours of wasted shows that came before. If you want to remember this show as great, avoid the ending series and stop at 8."
4,cut episodes.....again?,"I was awaiting the final season of Roseanne and after purchasing it on the day of release,I rushed home and started watching.To my horror each episode only runs 20 to 21 minutes.This happened on season one and the proceeding sets were complete and uncut.Why does this happen? The customer buys TV DVD sets because they want the complete show...not some syndicated cut up episodes.Don't even get me started on the Will and Grace sets.....Deborah Harry MIA."
4,Slide frames,The product was fine and the vendor was fast to ship with great response.The product description is wrong though. The item is a 20 pack instead of a 100 pack
1,,"These guys sure have a lot of important issues to talk about, and that's as far as I can go in supporting them. Musically, Clawfinger, who have sold more than a million copies worldwide (go figure), plays a style of hardcore/rap Metal and that's enough to prepare you for this. Love bands like Helmet, Stuck Mojo and the likes? Then you'll be in heaven with this. Personally, I could barely stomach it."
4,Read this book,"This is a very good book: It will start teaching you how to think about parallel programming and will help you get started in this area.Why only four stars you may ask? The trouble is that after over 40 years knowledge about parallel programming is still weak. The scientific computation folks have their (often heavy duty) tricks of the trade, but, as another reviewer pointed out, parallel computing is much more and is starting to address much broader areas.This book will help you wade through the maze of confusion and will help you get oriented - that is of a huge help. Then you need to practice..."
4,Probably one of the best books on this subject,"A little dry and a little repetitive but only to a small degree. The subject is (necessarily) approached from several different 'points of view' so some repetition is to be expected, but this should not discourage you from buying and reading this book, it is one of the most readable and affordable books on this topic. I highly recommend this book."
1,A total waste of money,"When I bought this book, I was hoping that the word 'patterns' in its title is only there to make it buzzword compliant. But sadly not. It is one of those completely useless pattern books, that long-windedly explain what should you do, without telling the how, and the why. Moreover all that explanations are about things, that you find out during the first day, when you actually sit down, and try to do some parallel programming."
1,Doesn't hang properly,First off this top is much lower cut than it appears. I just doesn't hang right.
4,It's all buena!,"As a PowerPuff Girls fan I could hardly not fall for Mucha Lucha. Unfortunately our local WB station has stopped running it, so I was very excited to see it offered on video. This has the first six stories from the show (that's THREE actual shows for a running time of about 65 minutes).This show is very over the top and cartoony. There's nothing real about it at all. (A character tries to gain 600 pounds overnight... and exceeds that.) But if you find the idea of a whole town of masked wrestlers pretty funny... wrestlers who have superpowers like turning into a bulldozer ... wrestlers who uphold the the pillars of Honor! Family! Tradition! (and Donuts!) then you might enjoy this cartoon.And don't miss the Chicos de Barrio music video at the end. The Mucha Lucha theme will run through your head all day!"
5,An excellent referrence tool,"For a firearms afficionado -- modern or historical --, The Encyclopedia of Weapons of WW2 is a godsend. The book covers everything from service pistols to the obscure German half-bikes personal transports.While it does have some fairly popular weapons missing from its pages, the book stands as a very coherent guide for any type of weaponry found in the bloodiest battle.One of the best coffee table books I can think of, though you might get some odd looks with this bad boy adorning your java bench."
1,question for earlier reviewer,"You, with your 20+ years experience: good review from a professional or semi-pro, but your review was very frustrating because it states that there are better books out there but doesn't say what they are. If this is only a C+, what's the A+ book that you're judging it by? I'd rather have that one."
4,Moved by this MOOD!!,"This album is a rare find. Among the other volumes in the Masters of Jazz series this features the ""HIT"" singles in the history of jazz. Early jazz originated in New Orleans at the beginning of the 1900's but it was the more sophisticated forms of ""bebop"" and ""cool"" jazz that gained the art form's wide acceptance. The artists showcased in this collection in my opinion greatly influenced these styles of jazz. My picks from this album are ""I'm in the MOOD for love"", ""April in Paris"" and ""The ""In"" crowd."" To be more specfic I would have to choose Coltrane's popular score ""My Favorite Things."" It was on this record that he played the soprano sax, which in turn did much to popularize this instrument among other jazz musicans. Overall I recommend this particular volume to anyone looking to sample some of the more ""revolutionary"" forms of jazz."
5,Perfect!,Ordered to fit my 2011 Chevy Avalanche and fits perfectly. Rolls up and secured by attached velcro strap. Certainly helped with our 100 degree Texas days.
2,Dial is hard to read,"This is an attractive looking watch, but the dial is so narrow and the markings so small that it is very difficult to read, even with glasses on."
3,Disney Villians line,"Very true to the Disney line, great detail. Only problem with this is eventually the part that holds the tape in, broke. Better for show, not actually using. Trying to figure out how to fix."
5,God and the FBI Janis Ian,God and the FBI Janis Ian - This CD was a surprize as I have many Janis Ian CDs and hadn't thought to get this one. Very good and may join as one of my favorites.
1,Worked once......then quit,I guess I'm the only one that has had a bad experience with this product. The card worked for the first video I transfered but quit working after that. I had to return it for a refund....However the editing software that came with it was very easy to use.
2,Beware if you get the white version,"Hi, I didn't read all the reviews here yet, but I went to my local Best Buy and got the Dazzle DVD Recorder, a white (new version?) as that's what they had, while I did read some reviews beforehand that must have been about the red (older version)? The White version DOES NOT come with the extra software - the 2 extra disks, one a QuickStart Studio or something, and the other a bonus disk. It just comes with the drivers for the device, and will only make DVD VOB files, no AVI or anything else which I wanted, can't even edit in MovieMaker. I'm returning this today. As for quality, I have my DVR hooked into it, and when ""monitoring"" it seems like VHS quality, but the resulting VOB files seems a bit better when played via VLC Player. I have a Toshiba laptop that just makes the minimum requirements, but the output from the laptop is S-Video'ed into my 32 inch TV, so I can see the difference between when the DVR goes to the TV directly vs. via Dazzle/PC to TV."
4,Very easy to use,"I bought this so I could transfer all my home videos and taped shows onto DVD. I thought it was very easy to install the software onto my laptop(which runs Vista). I did have to go online for one of the drivers for the editing program, but I have not used this yet since I haven't tried to put any new home videos onto DVD. I find that it's very easy, I just hit play on the VCR and start recording on the program and the movie records to DVD while I can still do other things on the computer and watch something else on TV, as long as I hit the TV/VCR button. I have had it stop recording 2 times, not sure if it was my computer or the program, but other wise no problems. Very easy to use over all."
1,Unpredictably Deffective,"The 1-Click DVD feature makes DVDs that appear to work, but have unpredictable defects. I have wasted upward of 48 hours of time trying to get the movie that this product created to work, with no avail. Don't buy--it is a shrink-wrapped piece of junk that was clearly not thoroughly tested."
3,Did not address product quality,"Very fast shipping and cooperation from seller, but product was of low quality which should have been stipulated by the seller"
4,Good,Its a pretty easy product and I was up and running in minutes and started burning DVDs of home videos.
2,"Maybe plug and work for you, but not me...","Somewhat finicky in setting up the Dazzle. Just getting software upgrades installed was not straight forward. Getting USB port recognition correct before seeing video was a challenge.After 8-10 hours of work, still have yet to produce a DVD.So, maybe with a higher performance system (>1.99 GHz AMD CPU, with > 2 GB memory, ? video board) you may have better luck than I.2 stars, since it does work and is not a complete waste of money."
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!,"do not buy this. Neither the pinnacle software or the direct to dvd software could actually record to a DVD without crashing. I am sending this back. To be fair, I was able to connect the video capture device to the computer with favorable video quality."
3,Dazzle is so-so,"I bought this in October but didn't get a chance to try it out until after the holidays. The connections were touchy so I had to be careful moving about my desk when it was connected. The instructions that came with it were about nil, so I sort of figured it out myself. Part of the software that came with it could transfer direct to DVD, but I couldn't get that to work. It also came with Studio 10 Pinnacle, so I used that (also figured it out myself), and have been able to transfer video to my hard drive. Boy does it take a lot of space!!!!! I am glad I am able to use it, but I wish there were an easier way for us non-techies who just want to edit and create a couple of DVDs!"
1,Dazzle Products,"I've had dazzle products in the past. Usually a very good product, This DVD Recorder is just not very reliable. I would recommmend spending a little more and getting one of the higher end dazzle products."
4,Good method to capture your VHS videos to digital,Easy to use and an extensive software suite provided. Digital recordings are far from perfect but considering they began as VHS the recordings are pretty darn good. Software loaded easily on my Windows XP Home machine and have no problems.
4,"Device good, software so-so","I got the Dazzle to convert several home movies from S-VHS to DVD. The Dazzle was very simple to connect and start capturing. The software that came with the device was not as nice. The direct-to-disk works well, but you can only capture one movie to the disk and it closes it. It would be nice if you could leave the DVD open and burn multiple movies to it. The Pinnacle Quick Start is okay, but it requires several patches to run on Vista, where it still doesn't behave well."
5,Hace su funcion,"Funciona bien cuando pasas video de forma simultanea, para la edicion y manejo del software se requiere de un equipo de computo potente. Pero logre mi cometido, salvar mis vhs a dvd!!"
2,this program realy dosen't work well..........,"I JUST BUY THIS PROGRAM,BUT I CAN'T USED BECAUSE THE CODE KEYS DOSEN'T WORK I JUST TRY TO CONTACT COSTUMER SUPPORT,BUT THEY DIDN'T HELP ME THEY HAVE A STUPID SISTEM, WHEN YOU ENTERED THE KEYS CODE BECAME A POP UP WHO SAID THE KEY CODE IS NOT ACEPTED, I'M SICK AND TIRED ABOUT COSTUMER SUPPORT, FOR THIS REASON I CAN'T USED THIS PROGRAM,,,,IT REALY SUCKS!!!! DON'T BUY IT......"
2,Compatibility problem,It's not working with my Toshiba Tecra M2 laptop -- it keeps wanting an update to my video driver that doesn't exist.
2,Not that great,"I does kind of work. It is not really combatible with vista. After attempting to load the software numerous times I gave up. The supposed ""patch"" download on the pinnacle web site is incredibly hard to locate as there are numerous other options and fixes that don't pertain to my operating system. The direct to dvd burning software that came with it does work though. It's OK if all you want to do is copy vhsc direct to dvd with no editing."
3,Works as advertised,"I purchased this product to copy to DVD programs I had saved on my Tivo. The product works very well. Teh installation can be a little tricky, I had to install the software twice to make it work. I do not have Vista, and thus did not encounter some of the problems other users have mentioned. The software included in the package is for XP, the Vista patch has to be downloaded (no big deal).After installing I had to play a little with the preferences in order to pick up the incoming video signal. Apparently this has more to do with my low tech laptop (a cheap model). However, I imagine I am not the only one out there with a similar computer. My point is that you may need to be persistent (check the Pinnacle website)if it doesn't work at first...but when once works, it's quite nice.The software included does more than the basics for editing your videos, though you can always upgrade if you want to get fancier. I consider the software included to be more than adequate."
1,there are better ways to copy,"This was really complicated for a person with my computer skills (not very technical). I finally got some progress, but then gave up on it. There are better ways to copy tapes to DVDs. Don't get this."
5,Dazzled Me,"This is a very simple easy way to transfer your VHS, 8mm or what ever. To preserve your keepsakes for ever on DVD. I would reccomend this product to anyone. Mostly for the simplicity.Jo Ann"
1,Please Don't but anything From Pinnacle,I have old VCR tapes that I wanted to convert to my hard drive. I bought two Pinnacle products within two weeks and they were worthless. The customer support is just as worthless as the product. Please...Please don't waist your time or money with these devices it will only add to your frustration. I even tried to download updated drivers from their website and it installed some 3rd party driver detection software that tried to make me pay for it. During this rough economy this is one of those companies that need to go out of business.
2,Good book to learn about Russian food,The information is presented well and accurately. The only problem is that Russian food is boring. I made some of the recipes and have no intention of ever making any of them again.
4,"Good deal, for what I paid.",Nice product. I paid much less than they are currently selling for (about $5.) so watch for sales from this seller.
2,Fraud,"To any true Sinatra fan, this collection represents some of his weaker stuff. The claim that it is ""Frank Sinatra's Greatest Hits"" is totally fraudulent."
4,"A few great hits, the rest aren't...","There are a few great songs on this album (Summer Wind, This Town - both were featured in the movie ""Matchstick Men"" with Nicholas Cage), and you won't find them anywhere else (including iTunes). Unfortunately the rest of the album is basically over-produced mainstream arrangements, some of which are pretty darn cheesey...Even so, it may be worth buying the album just for the few good ones - they're top-shelf."
2,Film Noir music fan from Sydney,"I was disappointed in this CD. I expected more music and less dialogue. If I wanted to hear the dialogue I would have rented the video. As an example, I've heard an extended version of the music from The Letter but barely 2 mins is played on this CD. A pity as the concept is good."
4,For NOIR lovers who can't get enough......,"Great score/dialogue disc for the hard-boiled NOIR buff who needs an occasional fix when not enjoying a NOIR film. Throw this on when you're hanging around the house, and enjoy selections from the overwrought scores to a number of classic NOIRs as well as choice samples of hard-boiled dialogue. I had hoped that better NOIRS would be featured,('DETOUR', 'D.O.A.','OUT OF THE PAST') but hey, maybe they'll be a part two."
1,Good idea gone bad,"This would have been a great CD if it were only the music. There is too much dialog, and much of the music is butchered up !!!What happened here? I can rent/buy the films if I want dialog. This type of CD is back in the 1960s !!! What a waste.Rhino/Turner: Why not do it again right?"
2,problematic,i agree with the other reviewers...the dialogue basically ruins the whole thing. i just wanted to (and STILL want to) hear the unadulterated music themes. couldn't they just have put the dialogue BETWEEN the songs?
1,Screw heads too small,The screw heads are too small - they rotate in the T-track and one side can tilt out. I replaced the screws with ones designed to ride in a T-track.
5,Masterful,"Otto Klemperer never fails. This recording, which made Margaret Price a star, is masterful, the tempi not too slow. Five stars for his conducting in all three Da Ponte-operas!"
1,Not very good recipes,"The recipes in this recipe look really cute, but several of the recipes all depend on the same pastry dough (which doesn't work). In order for the pastry dough to form a pie crust for me, I had to double the liquid in the recipe. The directions were simple enough for my kids (4 1/2 and 7), but the recipes really should have worked as written. Honestly, I don't think there aren't enough recipes in the cookbook or basic cooking instructions to make this Usborne cookbook worth purchasing.I would recommend Molly Katzen's kids cookbooks over this one. My kids have loved all of hers (Honest Pretzels, Salad People). My other favorite kids cookbook isKids Cook!: Fabulous Food for the Whole Family (Williamson Kids Can! Series)That's my favorite and is probably the one I'd recommend first."
3,Excellent Info on Horses,"But the breed section has a fatal flaw. All the conformation pictures are drawn! I was surprised at this. The begining of this book is nice, breeding, reproduction, communication, etc. The breed section is small compared to other books and photos are rare but it is easy to read and understand. I would recomend it for the younger horse lover."
1,Stale and bad customer service,"The product was stale, 8 months old. My package was unaccounted for almost 10 days. I contacted customer service several times inquiring about my shipment, and did not get any help. I will not recommend or use their services again."
4,YUMMY,the burst of orange when i bite into the candy was a nice surprise. the toffee was fresh and chewy. the carmel was nice and flavorful. each candy was such a delight. the problem was the tin was badly dented. i had bought 2 for presents. i went to the dollar store and bought a tin and the other one i kept for myself after i tested the candy!!
3,It's not Russell Stovers but it's still okay.,Quick shipping. Nice packaging but was little disappointed with the candy itself. Seemed there was not an equal amount of the candies and there was definately more of the candy I didn't like or couldn't eat like the toffee penny.
3,"Could we have separate disks, please?","Part one is an absolute classic, and I was hoping to get a copy to pass along to the next generation in our family. As others have said here, the taglines from that wonderful album became taglines in our family. But part two is just sad ... like those awful Encyclopedia Brittannica TV spots Freberg had his kid doing a decade or so ago. Watching somebody you really loved and admired try to go back to the well is depressing. What's even more depressing is to find that apparently you can only get Volume One bundled -- and tracks intermixed -- with Volume Two. My suspicion is that it's the only way to sell that pathetic attempt at a Second Act. Wish I felt differently -- I really wanted to like this, but it just isn't funny."
1,"I loved history class, but I loathed this album","The whole album tries too hard. It was highly recommended to me, but doesn't compare to other comedy albums I've heard. It's contrived and tedious to listen to. If you dislike anachronisms, you're really going to dislike most of his jokes."
3,"Five stars for Vol. 1, two and a half stars for Vol. 2","I remember listening to Volume 1 as a child, remembering fondly those great one-liners that could only come from the mind of Stan Freberg. So when I heard that ""Stan Freberg's the United States of America, the Early Years"" was on CD, together with the recently recorded ""Volume 2: The Middle Years"", I jumped at buying it.The good news is that Volume 1 is just as funny and fresh as it was when it was first released on vinyl some 40 years ago. The not-so-good news is that Volume 2, on the second CD, creatively and comedically falls far short of Volume 1. The Madison, Jefferson, Franklin and Osbourne ad agency and Frances Scott Key bits are pretty good, but the material loses steam after that. In fact, much of the second CD is tedious to listen to, especially the part with Lincoln and the psychologist. Volume 2 lacks the punch and wit of Volume 1.Were it not for Volume 1, I would have been generally disappointed with this CD set."
2,Not the same as the album,"The CD was in very good quality and exactly what I had ordered. It came in a timely manner as well. I bought this for my father because he had the album for years but it became scratched. He asked for the CD for Christmas. However, after comparing the album to the CD there are some omissions that we noticed that disappointed him because they were lines that he enjoyed. Otherwise, everything is fine."
5,Stan the American Freberg,After hearing most of his comedy records which are funny I decided to give this a try after hearing some of the sketches on his box set. Anything Stan freberg did is funny and theese albums along with his other records are funny. You should get them.
3,Aging in the West,"Prof. Lukacs attempts to elaborate the conditions prevailing as the Modern Age winds down in the West, esp. in the US. No other recent book have I marked up and raised questions of its contents. His fear is not of science per se though of its sometimes unruly offspring, ""Technology"". Does he engage in a ""reductio ad absurdum"" to get it right about Hitler? Lastly, he is a devout believer, Catholic, not such a bad choice, though his belief lacks inspiration and conviction. It is likely an intellectual determination against the godless Fascists and Communists whose destructive forces he witnessed in his youth."
3,If he were alive today........,This is what Hilaire Belloc would have written today.Compulsary education wiped out illiteracy but functional illiteracy has exploded as public schools have become custodians for those wishing to postpone adulthood.
3,Large too small,"I have always loved these towels for camping and then came along children and they are great to take to the beach, especially when you are hiking there and want to lighten your load. However, my children ages 2 and 6, complain these are too small. I would say they are great to dry off with but certainly not to wrap up in. I would go ahead and buy the x-lrg size for all your family members."
2,Too small for tall people,"I'm 5ft9in woman with a normal/thin frame. I bought this towel to take to the gym. It was just a few crucial inches too short and narrow, such that I couldn't anything in the gym without one hand clutched to keep the towel carefully position for modesty. It would barely overlap when I wrapped it around myself, was a bit too short for comfort, and wouldn't stay wrapped --definitely an irritation if you're trying to stay a little modest in a communal locker room. Getting dried with it was a bit like getting dried off with a generous hand-towel -- sure you can do it, but it's irritating.The actual fabric is fine, about what you'd expect for a travel towel -- not plush but it gets the job done. I just think the whole towel would benefit from adding 2 inches in each direction. I'm going to try ordering the next size up."
3,It's okay.,I used this all summer as we traveled through Europe... this towel is too small! I bought the large and it is WAY too small.
4,So far...so good,"I'll be updating this review when I return from field research in South Africa. But so far: 1) I washed it in the sink and the green color doesn't run. 2) This size is big enough to dry my hair and my body, but not big enough to wrap around a short, chubby woman. 3) It dried in about 4 hours in my bathroom in low humidity Colorado. 4) The fabric felt better than I thought it would. While it doesn't have the feel of a nice cotton towel, the texture is not at all objectionable. This very limited test at home, suggests that it will meet my needs for performance, comfort, and packability.I'll update in late November."
4,Nice Towel,"The only problem I encountered with this item is that I had specifically requested it in seafoam green but instead received what appeared to be blueberry. But even though I was disappointed with the color, I will say this towel really gets the job done. After swimming, it leaves me completely dry and doesn't take long to dry itself after I hang it, unlike ordinary bath towels. The next day, it's ready to bring to the pool again."
3,"Works, but is not great","I've got this towel and the Rick Steves branded ones.This towel is definitely tough, but that's because the weave is rougher than your standard microfiber.In my experience, the Aquis towel has never dried within 2 hours, and only rarely inside of 4 hours--what I consider to be ""fast."" Also, the loop at its end looks long, but the snaps are kinda close together not leaving a lot of room to comfortably snap around things. The size (19x39) is just big enough to get things done and no bigger."
3,Quite thick for an über modern towel.,"I have no complaints, but for a twenty something dollar towel it could have been at least less thick, I guess. Packing was ok. Just like a t-shirt."
3,Super absorbent but starts to smell,"The towel is a nice size and comfortable still wraps around my waist but folds down to a small size. My main problem (with this and other similar style towels) is that it starts to smell after awhile. I wash the towel fairly regularly but a smell starts to build up. I've had this problem with another similar style of towel, so I don't know if I'm doing it wrong or what. I'll lay it out to dry in my trunk most of the time after I use it and then wash it after about 5-6 uses but the smell still builds up."
5,Quick Dry!,"My husband took this on a vacation where packing had to be kept minimal. It dries quickly, wicks away water super fast and even after he has come home from his trip ... it's still the towel he always wants!"
3,My backup travel towel,"The Aquis packs very small but it's simply not as absorbent as a regular towel, leaving me a bit damp and uncomfortable in the tropics where I live. I'm using it as my backup travel towel in case my host doesn't have one or I need a shower at the airport but it's just not satisfying enough as a daily use towel."
2,Didn't hold up to it's description,"This towel was very absorbent. It was great for wriging out clothes in because it would absorb a ton of the water out of them. Unfortunately, wringing it out is much more difficult and since it holds so much water, it doesn't actually dry very fast. If you really soak some water into these, they take quite a while to dry hanging by their loop - it certainly won't dry completely overnight."
4,Great!,Great for travellers. This product is a great a towel or can be used as a blanket. This is great fr backpack traveling as it is full size but folds up small and dries fast.
3,"packs smaller, but not really better in any other way","I have had these towels for 5 years for the purpose of camping, pool, and beach, and have never liked them. Normally, I don't ask for too much in a towel, and I'm not concerned about softness. I like a towel that dries me well and then dries itself well. Compared to other towels I have used, this towel does neither well. In fact, I think terry cloth functions equally well if not a little better.It packs well and has a convenient snap loop for hanging on a tree branch, fence, or whatever's near you. As you may also expect with a micro pile towel, the texture is not soft. Again, this towel is not bad, it's just not good. Oh, and the nylon part of the stuff sacks nearly fell apart after the first use."
3,"Great feel, but dries somewhat slow!","I like the product but it did not serve that well the intended use. I bought it for my travel and while it is lighter than conventional cotton towels and is smaller when packed, it had a major drawback. It does not dry too quickly. Especially if it if gets completely wet, then it takes more than overnight to dry. But it is true that usually by just one drying it does not get completely wet. However, it has a very nice feel and even though not for traveling I plan to use it just as my regular towel.Thus, for my next trip, I will get a towel that might not be as good feel but dries much quicker. Second, I will get something that is about half of this size as I felt that even though it is light, I am still carrying more than I have to."
4,Great product but it was not what I thought it would be.,"I love the Aquis line of towels. I use the microfiber hair towel every day. So when I saw this product I though it would be a full body size. It was my error not to get out a tape measure and see that this towel is about the same size as my hair towel. I guess when I read ""large"" and ""adventure"" towel I thought it would be large enough for my fiancé to use at the gym. It isn't nearly big enough for that but it still is a great product."
5,A fresh take on the legend of the Mick,"There are lots of Mickey Mantle books out there, but I've never seen another like this. Anecdotes about Mickey from friends, teammates, and notable fans whose lives he touched. It's a fun, fast read as each story gives you a new perspective on one of the most colorful Yankees of all time. Unlike the standard-issue biographies out there, this book reads like a series of quick conversations and it is fascinating and entertaining to hear from such diverse names as Yogi Berra, David Halberstam, Regis Philbin, and Willie Mays. I learned a lot that I didn't know about Mickey, and I highly recommend this for you other Yankee fans out there."
5,Congratulations,"Well done! I remember when you two were kicking around the idea of a Mickey Mantle book. Congratulations on all your great ideas coming to fruition. You two make an excellent team. Good luck, I hope you sell them all! I look forward to your next collaboration."
4,"WOKE UP THIS MORNIN' GOT MYSELF A *** --""","Yes, it's all there. A grinding, exciting, pulsating mix of musicality. Strong rhythms, smooth mellow renditions like ""A Very Good Year"" by that well known crooner, ""Old Blue Eyes"". The hit show theme, ""Woke Up This Mornin'"" will get you moving, as will Bo Diddley's, ""I'm a Man"". This collection of music is as high-powered as the show. So get up, do some low impact aerobics, exercise, work-out, dance and groove to ""The Sopranos."""
4,I like it,"This CD has the theme song from the show. That is the main reason I bought it. As it turns out, it also has 6 or 7 other songs that I enjoy. I have bought or heard many CD's with fewer memorable songs. This one is worth the money."
5,You better buy or else,If you have watched the series or have the DVD this is a great add on. Just reminds you as you listen what could go wrong...
3,It's the first song that gets you,"The theme song of ""The Sopranos"" makes me feel like entering Tony's mansion. But the other tracks don't capture the escence of this great series"
2,Doesn't quite work,"Ok, granted the Sopranos theme is great and what's a show about Italians gonna do - not feature Sinatra? Gettouttaheee!However, the rest of the CD doesn't quite work. Like many soundtracks, the music may have been appropriate for the particular scene or episode, but each track listened to one after another just clashes with the listener. Even more importantly, songs that *should* have been included are missing. Most notably is the dreamy, somber, Mazzy Star track ""Look on Down From the Bridge"" used during the funeral scene in the first season. And, even though it'd just reinforce my argument, I can no longer hear the techno-guru Man With No Name anymore without picturing Tony Soprano in a strip club, popping Prozac, and reading ""Elder Care"", absolutely hilarious!The show is incredible, but listeners may be better served buying the ""Mob Hits"" collection. As for this CD, fuhhhgedabowdit."
5,must have,5 yrs after purchase this disc is still in my car cd wallet. It will broaden your horizons. The Nils Lofgren cut alone is worth the $. One of the very few discs where not a cut sucks.
4,great,"I got this just for the Sopranos main theme song, but most of the rest of the songs are also great, especially ""the Beast in me."""
4,Almost as good as the show!,"I ordered this CD because of the theme song, but the whole thing rocks! Was pleasantly surprised."
3,It's O.K.,"Just because the Sopranos is so popular, I think that many, otherwise intuitive amatuer reviewers are confusing a good soundtrack with a great TV show. The simple fact is that the CD is kind of trite. I've loved Woke up this Morning by A3 since they used it to promote the HBO series back in summer 98, and A Very Good Year by The Chairman of the Board, I Feel Free-Cream, and the tough I'm a Man-Bo Diddly fit the premise of the soundtrack, but even these are chestnuts! Out of place are Complicated Shadows, Beast in Me and Viking. And who was the genius who decided to use Inside of Me by Little Steven (one of the stars of the show), instead of his more appropriate Princess of Little Italy. Springsteens State Trooper is there merly for star power! Whatsamattame! Whatsamattayou!"
2,This soundtrack could have been better,"Ya know I only liked a few songs. Maybe because Iam younger I am more...picky. Personally they should have added more sintra, maybe some dean martin, a little bit of andrea bocelli and a whole lot of johnny lang. I am a new fan of RL burnside, that guy has got skills. Over all I wasn't pleased. The songs that I loved from the show didn't make it to the disc. I mean with a show like the sopranos you would think they would have a grade A soundtrack."
2,Forgeddaboudit!,"I recently bought this CD because I love the show & also love the theme song...but.......Unfortunately, besides the before mentioned theme song by A3 & the classic Sinatra tune ""When I was 21,"" I was very unhappy with the album."
3,It is OK,"Outstanding the Alabama three song -which is certainly while anyone would be interested in this compilation, there is not much. I would have been better off buying the Alabama Three CD with this, and other variations of the same song, on it."
2,Not the best songs,The CD is OK. Not impressed with sound quality and song selectionThe cover looked like it was not new
3,What was that song?,"One of the best episodes of ""The Sopranos"" was the one called Second Opinion. During the episode there was a song that was reprised at the end. It was beautiful and full of intriguing sentiments. Sadly, there was no credit given, at the end.Some of the lyrics were: ""She wants new shoulders to cry on...new backseats to lie on...Baby's in Black"", or at least, that is what it sounded like.Please, please, find out what that song is, and I promise to buy it from you."
4,Woke Up This Morning Comparison,"When I first heard the song ""Woke Up This Morning"" on the Sopranos, I thought it must be a Dire Straits song. Does anyone else think there is a similarity?"
1,"Only One Can Received, Not Case of 6. Misleading Listing","You get one can only, which is overpriced at 24.89. You can get it at $10-$15 at most gun shows. The list price is $130.80, and it states ""6 Aerosol Can"" in the listing title, leading you to believe you're getting a case of 6. You're not. For those of you who would argue this is a problem with the seller, MIDWEST MARINE & SPORTING GOODS, not the product, it's more of a problem with the listing. The listing title needs to be changed. You have to read the product description to see where it states ""One 26 oz can"" in a sentence with no punctuation. Honest mistake, deliberate omission, whatever the case may be, this is a misleading listing."
1,JLS S-M8 XM8 Spring Airsoft Rifle Tan,"JLS S-M8 XM8 Spring Airsoft Rifle TanThis ""toy"" broke within 5 days of receiving it. I mean completely fell apart, while my 13 year old grandson was trying to shoot the thing! Waste of money!! Now I am fighting to get my money back, because with Christmas and all, my daughter had to re-buy a similar item for him!!!"
1,Grandma,"You need to put the age limit on your gun, we ordered this for our 13 yr. old grandson and it is only for 18 or order. We had to return it and the shipping both ways was more than the gun itself! We were very unhappy!"
4,Ok Gun,This is a good gun but my cocking mechanism broke the 2nd day. And i barely used it. But the gun is good. It shoots hard and very accurate . Its a 1/1 scale weighs about 6lbs and feels very realistic and is 100% ambidextrious (Left and right handed).
5,LOVE IT!,"i love this gun... i just bought for my son and he actually got me to want to shoot it! its so crazy... now ill let my son talk..... Hey everybody this is Her son, this gun is great it shoots about 390 fps with .12 g bbs but with the .20 g bbs it shoots about 300 maybe a bit higher.( i still reccomend using .12 g bbs unless it is really windy) in the wind the .12 gs will curve but the .20g and the .25g bbs will slow the gun down too much for me. the bipod is great. if you have a team with a semi or automatic weapon lay down and hit EVERY shot.... my friend actually snuck up on me and i heard him and turned around and shot him and he was bleeding! right on the leg. and he was wearing sweatpants too! dont get me wrong.. ive seen better too! but for a 30$ gun this is awesome!"
2,poor all the way around,"I ordered for m son. Directions on assembly were worst ever. Pieces to assemble were missing, had to forge in my workshop to come up with the screws to attach a piece. I shouldn't have expected much for the price. Lesson learned"
1,piece of junk,this gun my sun bought for his 20th b-day and within a weeks time the metal bolt was twisted two weeks later the silincer broke almost making the gun illegal not too much longer after that the bolt snapped clean off and a few months later almost the intire orange tip snaps off. dont buy unless u can afford to keep replaceing it.
1,mag problems,I ordered this gun sometime between feb 1 and feb 3 i didnt get it until feb 7. it is very accurate when using 20 gram bbs the stock is adjustable but very flimsy. The bipod is a bit flimsy but not enough to effect accuracy. After about three days the mag would not release and I had figured out the release switch was broken. My experience with the gun was very bad. overall the gun is a flimsy and cheap product.
3,Spring Rifle,"This gun is a spring powered rifle, which means it can't go full or even semi-automatic. The bipod it comes with is cheap and it broke off the first time I used. The silencer doesn't work at all and the speed-loader it comes with is almost worthless. The magazine holds like 25 bbs and is made of plastic. The gun shoots pretty hard but the bbs float up. All in all, this is an ok back up gun, but I would not recommend using it as a primary."
4,wow!,"ok i was playing airsoft with this gun yesterday and i wuz amazed, we were doing teams and almost every shot i shot, hit and it hit hard if u udotn buy this u are a fu@#ing retard!"
4,"""Mest"" up reflections on life in general","Forgive the title, I'm trying to be clever. This is definately a CD worth looking into. But if you've listened to the last 2 CDs it may not be what you're expecting either. ""Wasting Time"" sounded more like earlier Green Day stuff and had a playful edge to it that I liked. I didn't care for ""Destination Unknown"" too much. It had a couple of good songs on it, but had so much sugary pop-punk on it that it was hard to tolerate listening to it for any length of time.On this CD, the band seems to have done some soul searching and reflecting on their lives over the past few years, and the songs on this CD reflect that. They're well written, catchy tunes with genuine emotion, but many times time slow and thoughful (which is a fairly big change from the care-free tone of their past endevors.) ""Jaded"", ""Chance of A Lifetime"", and ""Rooftops"" are songs that standout. Buy this, it's a great CD from a talented band. I just hope they cheer up for their next CD."
4,Pretty Cool CD,"I have to admit, after Destination Unknown, I truly didn't know where Mest was going next. I eagerly anticipated this CD and while it has some cool new stuff, most of the pop punk core of their other CD's remains intact. While this is not a bad thing, I would have liked a little more variation. Though all in all it is a good CD and I would still recommend it."
4,Pretty Good,"This is a pretty good CD. All you people taking stars off and saying it sucks because Benji from Good Charlotte is on it are losers. Good Charlotte isnt that bad and you know it, and no this isnt some 12 year old girl saying that, this is a 16 year old guy, so just face it their not that bad. I've seen this band live and their pretty awesome."
3,Mest,"I think this is a great CD, but personally, I believe Destination Unknown is a better listen. Probably the best song on this album is ""Rooftops"" but there are many good tracks, including ""Jaded (These Years)"" ft. Benji Madden (their single), ""Walking on Broken Glass"", and ""Until I Met You"" to name a few. There's two hidden tracks at the end of ""Paradise"", one is a song called ""25 to Life"" which I thought wasn't too quality. And the other thing is Benji Madden of Good Charlotte talking in a weird voice and saying a bunch of funny stuff. I found that part hilarious, if you're a Good Charlotte/Mest fan you'll get most of the inside jokes. But this CD is definitely worth a listen."
3,Pop,"I really liked the previous two CDs, and was quite looking forward to this upcoming CD. It is not a bad CD, it is just a little too pop punk for me. I generally avoid groups like Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, and that other group that I can't think of that sounds the exact same (apologies to those offended) for the very reason. It is a step in a new direction, it just doesn't suit me. If pop punk suits you, then go for it. I personally was just expecting something a little less weak than what I recieved."
2,disappointed,"i have been a fan of mest for a long time, and seen them numerous times in concert, but i do not like the new album at all. the first time i listened to it, i almost fell asleep... seriously. i dont know what happened, but they lost all their energy, and sense of humor. how will they entertain the crowd at warped tour, theres just no energy in this cd. and i was also disappointed how benji is in one of their songs, thats too bad.."
5,THE BEST C.D.,"THE BEST C.D. after good charlotte and pappa roach check out Benji Madden(from good Charlotte) in ,jaded these years,"
2,very messy,"This is first mest album i have heard so i cant compare it to earlier ones, nor does it make me want to purchase earlier ones. I bought this album after seeing Jaded on MTV, unfortuneatly its one of the few songs that actually works for them. They do have a good sound happening, they just dont know how to make a good song. The biggest problem is the lyrics, they are some of the worst i have ever heard, he rattles off every line from every other bands lyric book in no apparent order. You must be kidding if you think these lyrics actually mean something, the singer is just trying to sound like he knows what hes talking about.dont buy this cd, instead buy perhaps i suppose by rufio who know a little about songcraft and whos lyrics are a lot more coherrant, meaningful and original."
4,Mest Review,"I really enjoyed listening to the new Mest CD. Some of my favorite songs are Burning Bridges, Paradise, Chance of a Lifetime and Walking on Broken Glass. There's even an hidden track included and it's really good. I think they've matured alot from thier last album, these songs are more deep and have more meaning to them. I think you should buy this CD if your a Mest fan."
5,GREAT CD!,"i have been waiting for the longest time for Mest to get a new album out and now that it is out im so happy! it is a great CD! Mest is the greatest and i dont think there was a single bad track on the CD, that shows what good musicians they are! M E S T R O X M Y S O X O F F ! ! ! ! ! !"
3,i'm very disappointed!!,"i had high expectations for this cd, and i was hoping that mest would go back to their real punk style like they had on mo money mo 40'z. it's a good cd and i still love mest as much as ever, but this cd is emo!! c'mon guys i know you can make another cd like mo money!!"
1,WHAT HAPPENED TO MEST?,Every Mest Cd Until Now has been Great! This new one Blows! Mest Used to be a fun band but it seems all the songs on thier new cd are slow and lack any energy! I think Mest should give me my money back cuz this is one of the worst cd's I've ever purchased!
5,MEST ROCKS!!,I have been a mest fan since their first cd and this is one of the best. Some of the songs are alot different from their other stuff but it is still awesome. I would recommend this cd to all mest fans and punk listeners everywhere.
5,Mest is the Best!,"I have been a fan of Mest for almost 3 years, and I can say that this has to be the best CD of theirs up to date. It rocks. I especially like the song ""Night Alone"". It is so much more mature than ""Destination Unknown"", but still good as hell."
5,MEST UP!!! [for anyone who can hear...],"Hey now! MEST! K, so if you're looking into buying this album, you apparently have great taste in music. Mest's self-titled album is absolutely pure heart, truth, and rock. With their souls and thoughts worn out on their sleeves, MEST has put out one of the best albums, in opinion, in the past decade. Music that bangs your head and drives you to jump and scream out of you mind, and lyrics that tell you how real these guys are. GET MEST UP!!!!"
4,Mest CD,"I think this Mest CD is the best CD from mest, there are alot of really great songs on it, like Jaded, Rooftops, Walking on Broken Glass, and 2000 miles. The first CD from mest I bought was Waisting time, but I didnt think to highly of it. I recently bought this one and its a lot better, I would definatley recomend buying it, its worth your money, Its the best Mest CD out there."
3,Destination Unknown?,I would have to say first off that this sadly to say is not the best Mest album ever. I purchased this CD after hearing rooftops and after listening to the other songs on the album I have realized Mest has slown it down a lot and has gotten a lot more emotional then in the past. The addition of Benji Madden in Jaded these years is no surprise as it seems as if Mest is attempting to move to where Good Charlotte is now. In the end all I have to say is if you like bands such as Good Charlotte buy this cd but if you think its going to be like some of Mests old cds such as destination unkown or wasting time it is not the cd for you.
5,Amazing Album,"This album is nothing short of amazing. Mest has always been a favorite band of mine, but this album proves that they are incredible songwriters. ""Jaded"" featuring Benji Madden of Good Charlotte has become one of my new favorite songs. This Album is completely incredible. This album has a variety of songs, there are ballads, such as Jaded, and there are also hardcore rock songs, such as Until I met You, which is an awesome way to start off the cd."
2,Not their best.,"This CD is actually fairly average. I would attribute this to the fact they seem to be very willing to turn themselves into a band like Good Charlotte who is at best OK.This CD is fine from a musical standpoint however the lyrics while deeper, are missing the catchy and Sticks in your head qaulity of the 2 previous Mest albums.Mest was already a band made to be loved by GC fans, but they did had a creative edge that GC has never even had. No that creativity is gone and they have become as lame as GC. This CD does have about 3 solid tracks, however the rest arent anywhere near what I have come to expect from Mest."
1,Dissapointed,"As a fan of Mest for several years, I have to say that im dissapointed. Their once hard rock, has been replaced by girly pop songs that should never have been released. I tried desperately to give this cd a chance, but there isn't one song on the entire album that creates any adrenaline rush once so ever. If you're expecting a pure adrenaline rush like the last cds then definately leave this one on the shelf."
4,They're Baaaack,"Mest's 3rd album is alot like they're 1st 2, its flat-out amazing. Hardcore fans like me will be pleased with the cd because it's really just a textbook mest cd. Songs like 2000 miles and walking on broken glass keep up that quick punk beat whilesongs like night alone slow it down a bit while still rocking out. Buy this cd, and if you don't have wasting time or destination unknown, pick those up to."
3,Only half copasetic,"Aight, so I'm a big fan of the last two Mest albums, but come on, this is in no way up to par with those. They are tight with Good Charlotte, who is heading downhill and looks to try and bring Mest with em. It doesn't have that different style like Destination Unkown. Its aight, but thats as good as I can give it."
5,Amazing,"This cd is the best out of all their cds. It's def different from their other ones but still great. The lyrics have matured more because ""Tony's songwriting has improved"". Get this CD otherwise you are missing out. Dont forget to check out Destination Unknown, Wasting Time and the new MEST DVD THE SHOW MUST GO OFF."
5,Awesome CD,"This CD was really different than the last one, but I love it just as much. MEST are still going strong and bring us awesome tunes. The first song is amazing and Jaded (ft. Good Charlotte's Benji Madden) is a great song if you are in the mood for a slower hit. If you have any sense, you'll go out and buy this CD!"
5,What record should be in your cd player right now...,"Hey, for all those who haven't heard Mest's new self titled album, should really go out and get it. Listen to it, it's awesome. I don't think there is a single song you would skip on that album, every song has a good story behind it, and the special guest appearance with Benji Madden of Good Charlotte is a nice PLUS to the already awesome record. So, go get it now!"
2,All past times were better?,"Hope not, but unfortunately this is what happen to Mest last album, it lacks of spontaneity, all the songs seems to go to the same place, and the lyrics hadn't change since wasting time album, which I'd say is their best.When I heard Wasting Time, i thought this band has much to offer in the future, I really love this album, the second one has their moments but again, they began to become repetitive, but with this I don't know what they're thinking but sounds like the same boring albums that any kid put out there."
3,ok,i really thought it would be a whole lot better. yes some songs are good but it sound too much like blink 182 there ok but a just expected more.
1,Can it get any Worse?,"This CD is awful. Well I only heard the single and rooftops, pitiful. I am embarressed to ever say I listened to this band. Mo' Money was their only good CD, with GOOD ska. Wasting Time had one or two decent songs and everything else [is unacceptable]. Sorry kiddos. Listen to the new suicide machines, much better than this..."
5,Jaded,This album is great. It is different from there first albums in respect to emotion. You can hear passion in numerous tracks on the album.
5,greatest cd ever,this cd is awesome. anyone who likes music should buy this cd. it has fast paced song then it has songs like chance of a lifetime that is a slow and very thoughtful meaningful song.
5,Mest Love,"Mest's album ""Mest"" is by far one of the best album purchases I have made in the past year. With songs like ""Your Promise"", ""Return to Self-Loathing"", ""Chance of a Lifetime"", and ""Jaded (These Years)"", you see how much the band has matured since ""Destination Unknown"". I reccomend this CD for any Mest fan, or person who is looking for good, honest music that means something."
2,NEW MEST,I love Mest so I was stoaked and got the new one the first day it came out but I was so disappointed. This doesn't even sound like any of their old stuff and I LOVE their old stuff. Even thugh I have to admit its starting to grow on me and the first three songs are pretty good.
5,MEST,"The new album is phenomanal! Tony and Jere's song writing has really stepped up. With the help of friends such as John Feldman from Goldfinger and Benji Madden from Good Charlotte the music on this new self titled album has to be the best they have produced since the start of their career, I would highly recomended it to anyone new to the band and old school hardcore fans too."
5,milwalkies best,"this cd is the best but i'd have to say that their previous records were more fast and great with the funny lyrics =) They are a little more serious and slow on this record but it's still a really great record. If you were to buy this, you wouldn't be wasting any money.. Mest is a really great band and they rock"
2,bubble-gum punk,"Lately I have been very dissapointed with the stuff that's coming out of the so called 'punk' world. Cant anyone make something original! this MEST CD is as low down and unoriginal as you can get, I would advise anyone who is looking here not to buy this cd. I gave this CD two stars because at least they copy blink 182/New found glory well. I don't even like new found glory. If you are one of those people that loves good charlotte and blink 182 (for their songs like rock show and small things) then buy this, but If you are someone really looking for a really good band that is new and original look elsewhere. This would have been cool music for me to listen to when I was 11."
4,Well....Its ok,"It's not the best Mest cd to date because of it's more mature sound. Well it's still worth the money. I mean it has a few good songs, but i wish they would have stuck with the old sound."
5,It totally rox!!!!,"I love Mest, but this CD made me love them even more. I love the song jaded...and hearing Benji from GC's voice on the song makes even better. I totally recommend for anyone that likes punk to buy this CD."
5,Great CD,"After listening to all three of MeST's other CD's (Mo Money Mo 40'z, Wasting Time, Destination Unknown), I would have to say that S/T is their best work yet. I'm not normally into what they call ""pop-punk"" but there's a certain vibe about MeST and just the way they put their songs together that makes me keep buying their CD's and going to their shows. They've got a lot of energy and the vocals of both Tony Lovato and Jeremiah Rangel are amazing to me. They are just a really fun band to see and listen to and if you were to buy one of their records right now, S/T should be it. Their songwriting ability has become more mature and diverse, both lyrically and musically and they're just great right now. Buy this record right now!"
2,Almost Mediocre...,"I've been a Mest fan ever since 'Mo money, Mo 40z' and i must say, This is as generic as sellout pop-punk gets. They are capable of doing much better than this. This lacks the energy of their past releases, and the songs are WAY TOO SLOW and overproduced, and, there are NO guitar riffs. It's almost like they gave up their guitars for a sythesizer. There are a few good songs though, the first two are pretty good, and there is another one that is OK, but after that, every song sounds exactely the same. They are on their way to becoming another Good Charlotte TRL sellout."
5,Mest just keep on getting better!,"having been eagerly waiting for the release of mest's 4th album, i was not disappointed in the least. The tracks that stand out, are jaded (these years) and 2000 miles. It's good to see that Mest can mature in their music style, and still remain the same band. Go and buy this record-it's as simple as that. If you like mests old stuff, good charlotte or any pop punk bands you'll love this record. It belongs in any self-respecting music fan's CD collection."
3,Its not as bad as some people might say,"ok everyone that ive talked to has said that this CD lacks variety and sounds like there old stuff. But you know what it is a descent cd, there are like 4 or so good songs on here. thats a good enough reason to buy it, right? I think that also Mest lyrics need to be brushed up a bit, kinda blunt and over used. OTher then that i still listen to it and love it being a mest fan. this cd is definantly worth it."
5,mest rocks!!!,this cd is awesome!!! i knew mest was gonna give us a kick-ass album and they did!!! i don't know how these guys do it... this music kicks ass... my ears are bleeding from cranking this album too loud.... I SUGGEST EVERYONE BUY THIS SICK ALBUM!!!
5,>>>>Their Best Album to Date<<<<,I hope this review helps some of you decide whether or not you should buy this album...well...all I can say is its awesome and you should buy it now! You know how usually only a few songs are good on a band's album?...well on this album they're all good! I like every one of them...especially since they all have an awesome chorus. I can't stop listening to it because the songs grab me by the ears. Simply Mest's best album...
1,THIS CD SUCKS,"Ive been a mest fan for 4 years, AND THIS CD SUCKS. ITS poppy as hell and its not them. Go buy their 2nd cd ""Wasting Time"",cause youre wasting your time by looking at this cd"
5,mest s/t cd,This cd is the best MEST album. It is a combination of fast paced and slow punk/rock songs. Definitely a must for every one who likes punk/rock.-Liz
2,WTF?,"so.. i have all the Mest CD's, including some demo's with unreleased songs. they sounded great to begin with... but WHAT HAPPENED? their SKA-punk sounds has morphed into crappy POP-punk. only kids who can like radio-friendly music would find this genre entertaining. In a day and age where you can call this and bands like new found glory and arvil levigne punk, we've got some serious problems. don't get me wrong, for many of you this is good, even great music. but unfortunetly the music scene turns more and more ""good charlotte"" and less ""rancid"" everyday. bland, poppy, and unexciting."
3,Medio-core,"The CD is okay, but the fact that Benji from Good Charlotte contributes I had to drop it a star. The other star was dropped b/c of the lack of...um...what was it? oh yeah! punk...the lack of any punk whatsoever on this CD made me drop teh other star.What WAS good about the CD was it was a new direction, but each song just sounds like a simulation of Good Charlotte, NFG, and Something Corporate. Mest used to be somewhat ORIGINAL from what I remember.""25 To Life"" ia an amazing song. ""Until I Met You"" is almost straight out of Wasting Time which is awesome! My favorites on the CD by far. Also, ""Rooftops"" and ""Burning Bridges"" are songs you just want to sing along to. ""Paradise"" and ""Chance In Your Lifetime"" just sound like Green Day. Jeremiah usually writes really good songs, but the ones on this CD are mediocre at best.My analysis - ""eh""......I think they should seriously consider going back to the way they were in Mo' Money Mo' 40z and Wasting Time. They weren't so...[bad]"
4,MEST IS AWESOME!!!,"I was going to have an open mind about this CD because i didnt know what to expect, ya know, they have a range of songs, but this CD [...]!!! All the songs were awesome, great lyrics. It was tottaly mind boggling."
4,Solid add on for a Ranger,"My Ranger has the 3.0 liter flex fuel engine that is a little anemic with just over 150hp stock. This intake added a nice little kick at the high end with no noticable difference until about 3500 rpms. Overall I'm happy with it, but for the price compared to performance it only deserves four stars."
4,Great Stuff!,"The Superman Dailies of the 40's were not the most enthralling comic strips ever written but this book presents them in their best light. My only complaint and thus the 4 stars, was they stopped the book in the middle (?) of a storyline just one episode into 1940. I think they could've finished the storyline then went onto the next book which I hope will be released soon. The intro materials were short but absolutely interesting.All in all this is a great companion to any comic book collection and a nice addition to the Batman Dailies Kitchen Sink published years ago. I can't wait for the Sunday Strips or the rest of the dailies."
5,brings back the hands of time.,this book compiles the very first newspaper syndication of superman from the very first episode during the 1930s.what is amazing is how the publishers have recreated the newspaper edition in such clear and nice printing consideringthat the artworks here are from an old generation. it is a nice collector's item for superman fans.
3,Superman the Superchauvanist!,"These comic strips are a document of their times. Violent and chauvanistic. Superman terrorizes one criminal into having a heart attack, which doesn't stop him from giving the same treatment to another criminal. Lois Lane strives to get off the LoveLorn page - ""Stay there, it's safer."" Makes you want to grit your teeth. Doesn't mean these strips should be censored or made 'politically correct.' Not at all. Read, and realize how far we've come. But - how far have we come??"
4,"adjustable dress, decent quality","We ordered this Dorothy costume for our daughter, who is just barely size 7. The blouse and dress are separate, which worked out well for us. The straps were much too long but we were able to shorten them with a quick stitch-up. The material is a little scratchy but with a shirt underneath it's fine. I think the quality is better than those satiny versions (I didn't check the material but it feels like polyester or very rough cotton), and I like that it's not tarted up with glitter and sequence."
2,Not like Dorothy at all,I am a stickler for details. Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz wore a cornflower blue dress with white check. This costume was more like a royal blue and white. Not like Dorothy. The costume also wasnt very good quality. I returned it.
4,Nice,This was a nice costume. It did have a few odd stitching patterns that made it a little difficult to get positioned correctly but all in all it was alright.
1,window visor,This is the second visor I have bought that does not fit a 2003 f150 crew cab. It said it would on the vehicle check feature. Not too sure why that is but the window shape is definitely different that what I have been sent. The visor has rounded edges which will not work in a squared off window frame. The picture depits a squared off shape so be careful on this one.
4,Everything I expected.,"Wow, this order arrived well ahead of Schedule and in perfect condition. Installed easily, looks good. Since it is a window seal channel install, it creates a bit of a bind when window rolled all the way up - no big deal."
4,Good boots,"The boots are fairly comfortable right out of the box. After several months, they have not begun to show any wear yet. The laces do feel a bit flimsy but haven't broken yet."
5,Can't beat Wolverine,"Fast and responsive service from seller. Boots are BNIB. If you buy boots from online tho, I would recommend stopping by somewhere and trying on different boots & sizes so you will know about what size you need since all of these boots sizes and widths are definitely different from one manufacturer to another. I stopped by a national outdoor big box store and tried on several pair then came here and ordered about $35 cheaper than the store. If you purchase a lot of stuff from Amazon, sign up for a Prime account, it's worth it and pays for itself with the savings on shipping charges throughout the year."
2,Runs very large,"I always buy size 10 EE shoes and boots, but these were nearly one size too large for me. I had to spend about $16 shipping them back, so I'm only buying products like this in the store from now on. They did seem to be well made."
2,Seams came apart in 100 days,"I bnought these for my husband who wears a 4E 11.5 and these Wolverine XW fit perfectly. We are back-country USFS volunteers and he used these boots daily from May through Aug 2008. The only problem, and it is a big one, is that the stitching on the seams around the outside of each boot began to separate. I can get them repaired but it will negate the waterproofing. The components wore well and the boots were comfortable but just did not hold up to daily wear in the back country of Wyoming."
4,Basic for great price...,"These are very basic hikers for a really great price. If you need a pair just to knock around in, these are for you!"
2,Alright,"This book approaches jobs in a unique way yes, however it is not needed. Many books write the same type of suggestions that this book offers. Simply taking a trip to the librabry and reading up on interviews and how to approach them will save you the cost of this book. One suggestion even hints at giving the hiring manager a gift that will better your chances of them reviewing your resume and thus inviting you into thier office for and interview. I don't know what lengths people will go to in order to get this job but that sounds like bribery and just plain not ethical. The book can be read in a day and the suggestions again are rudimentary at best. I gave this book a two star as it was useful in that it will give you a few websites to review and a page and a half of assertive words to use on a resume. Other than that(which can be found all at your local library), this book isnt't worth your time."
3,Cute semi predictable,I thought this was a very cute story but at times it was a little predictable as to what would happen. But that didnt take away from the story. Although its very obvious who she would end up with the in between parts were very interesting and funny. If you're looking for something quick and funny to read this is Def it!
2,Average,"I won't bother with summarizing the plot as it has been done already. All I want to say is that I didn't like this book. I found it boring and predictable. Too predictable. To me the characters didn't come alive. I bought the book because of the good reviews I saw online, but I was disappointed when I started reading. My advice to you is to read the first couple pages in the store to see if you like it before you buy it."
5,A Stylish New York Romance,"Ok, so Sami is an aspiring clothes designer. So she moves into an apartment with a model, Rain. Enter the totally Hott, Vin. Now with a six pack like Nancy describes I've no idea how she could pass him up for Bruce. Yet when Bruce steals her designs she feels a little differently. Yet still can't seem to find the hottness of Vin irresistable. The combination of the main characters (Sami, Vin, and Rain) is a real up-lifting feeling. It'll put you in goos spirits and make you want to jump a plane to New York. Sami is an ambitious girl and I found her to be loveable. I found the book to be funny as well as romantic. I would kill to be in Sami's shoes. It also makes you think a little about your love life. Is Mr. Right starring you in the face? Read the book to see if Sami and Vin get together. It's a fun book to read. I really recommend it!!"
4,fun series,"Simon Pulse Romantic Comedies are always a fun read. These books are not necessarily the best written novels but the stories are always fun and you know you will get a happy ending. I think some adult romances could take a note from these books b/c they are characterized well which is much of the battle in writing any novel since you want your characters, for the most part, to be endearing and relatable."
1,broke the first day,"The grandparents bought this for my 5-year old for Christmas. He liked it, but the touchscreen broke the first day. Not exactly reliable."
4,Really Neat!!,"I got this for Christmas, and I love it!! There are lots of cool games to play, and you can take it about everywhere."
4,Good 50's R&B,"This CD contains 20 of the 24 R&B charted hits by Ruth Brown on Atlantic between 1949 and 1960. Atlantic supplied her with excellent session players and varied material to make her their most popular recording artist of the 50's and the third most popular R&B performer of the decade. The best tracks are the uptempo R&B ""Teardrops From My Eyes"" from 1950 and ""Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean"" from 1953, the bluesy ballad ""Oh What A Dream"" from 1954 and the Rock and Roll ""Lucky Lips"" from 1957. Just about every track on this CD is good R&B. However the final 2 tracks are live recordings from a concert with so-so acoustics and ""Love Has Joined Us Together"" is a forced duet with Clyde McPhatter which is not done in her style at all. The liner notes contain good historical data about her, but there is no discography."
4,Good compromise,"I bought this item for use in a space that would not accommodate a full size, installed speaker. The performance is better than I expected. Better low frequency response than anticipated. Mids are ok, sometimes sound a little under water, but overall, acceptable. Highs are satisfying. These speakers are a very good value."
3,Might work for the right application,"I had to return these speakers because the mounting system requires a large 3/8-inch or so hole drilled through the surface of whatever you are mounting to, and the installation requires access to the backside of the surface to tighten the speakers down. This may work for a rear deck installation, but would not work in my application. Other than that the speakers looked like nice units."
5,havent purchased yet,"These pioneer speakers look very powerfull and sleek I have a pair of 6'5"" coaxial 2 way speakers and another pair of 6'5 3 way spaekers and MAN do they sound great but I'm curious about the peak power on these I'm definetlty going to buy these I just have to get me an amazon card!!!!! Oh and I would like to know the watt amount acceptable for these"
4,Men's Plastic Shoe Tree,This shoe tree is exactly what I was looking for and were such a great deal that I purchased a dozen pairs. They work great and I am very happy with them.
5,satisfied,I am very pleased with this product.They serve thier purpose and are much better than more expensive trees I've had in the past.
2,Get What You Pay For...,"These are inexpensive, but honestly, you get what you pay for. Much prefer wooden shoe trees. Next time I will pay the extra money."
4,"Interesting, but not for beginners...","I want to learn Chinese and I don't have any experience with this language. I bought this book because i want to learn Chinese, but I think it's not so easy than others you can find in Amazon.If you know some Chinese, maybe it will be good for you. If your a beginner like me, try with some other."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I CHOSE THIS BOOK BASED ON THE GOOD REVIEWS AS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND WHO WAS INTERESTED IN LEARNING CHINESE. WHEN MY FRIEND RECIEVED IT, HE SAID IT DOES NOT TEACH YOU HOW TO ""SPEAK"" CHINESE VERY WELL. FOR THE PRICE I PAID FOR 76 PAGES, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED HE DIDN'T LIKE IT."
5,CLASSICAL BUT INNOVATIVE PSY-TRANCE,"WITH HIS NEW ALBUM D.YOUNG(CHI-AD) PUT HIMSELF INTO THE WORLD'S BEST PSY-TRANCE PRODUCERS.""ANNO DOMINI"" BECAME ONE OF MY BEST CD'S FOR 1999.TRACKS LIKE ""THE FLAME OF ETERNAL LIFE"",""MOONART"",""SHADOW SPIRIT"",""REDIVIDER"" TRAVELLED ME INTO GREAT THOUGHTS.I BELIEVE THAT CHI-AD IS THE GROUP WHICH REACHED TOO CLOSE TO THE WONDERFULL FEELING OF THE LEGENDARY ""TRANSWAVE"".I SUGGEST THIS ALBUM TO EVERYONE WHO WANTS A CLASSIC CD IN HIS CD COLLECTION."
2,worse product,i really hate the book so much complicated words and the class made it worse :( i dont recommend this book or the class
2,Way late,This package came a lot later than even the latest date of the estimated arrival date. There was no tracking information given and no way to know when or if it would come.
2,dissatisfied customer,I can't review this product because I haven't received it yet!!! I have sent two e-mails and have not received a reply yet!! Classes start tomorrow and I still do not have a book!! What makes it worse is this is an online class which makes it mor difficult! I have received all my other books except practical business math procedures 9th edition Jeffrey Slaterwhich i recieved a little manual when I THOUGHT i WAs ordering the text book! If I have to drop these two classes I not only will not graduate but I can't work for the school to earn a little extra money! If there is anything you can do I would really appreciate it!
1,Wrong book,"I needed Interactive Statistics 3rd edition, what you sent me was the 2nd edition, which is completely useless to me."
1,not what it seems,The title to this book is very misleading. All it is is a collection of magazine articles from some Australian performance magazine about various cars that have been built up and turbocharged or supercharged. There is no practical useful information on turbocharging in it.
2,SO SO,"NOTHING TECH ABOUT IT, BUT DOES HAVE COOL ILLUSTRATIONS.LOOKS LIKE A DOWN UNDER MAGAZINE IN A HARDBACK.THIS IS A GOOD BOOK TO HAVE ON YOUR SHELF FOR KIDS TO LOOK AND WOW AT. REALLY NOT MUCH ELSE."
5,Sumack Rocks!,"Okay, this is cheating, but I haven't heard the CD. But I have heard them live in concert, and they are amazing. Great writing and music playing. And a really great concert. I plan to buy the CD very soon. During one song, they trade instruments five times, each member playing each instrument and singing. All of them are extremely talented. I recommmend buying this CD right NOW! If you read this Sumack, put me on your mailing list, I didn't get a chance to give my address at the concert. chaosdsl@hotmail.com Thanks!"
1,scam,"This product as described is misleading and deceptive .It is a low quality set of springs thai is covered with vinyl,with very little padding. It costs more to return this item than the original purchase price.Please read return policy before any thought of purchase !"
5,Something special,"This unique book makes a thoughtful gift, especially with the companion book for ""Moms."" So many special stories, rhymes, fairy tales to make you an expert on the ""old fashioned"" while also supplying notes that warm the sometimes tired parent's soul. We love it!"
4,"I liked the book, don't know if my husband did",I bought this book for my husband before we have our first baby. I was more excited than he was to have the lyrics to old songs and cool craft and cooking ideas. He has yet to look through it. Maybe he will use it more once the baby is actually here. Keep you posted.
1,"same book as ""knee deep in grace""","I was quite disappointed, not by the content of the book itself (getting the account of Dipa Ma's life is a real gift to every reader), but by the fact that it is almost exactly the same book as ""knee deep in grace""; this is false advertising, and as if Dipa Ma's legacy was already exploited...."
3,"Fascinating Woman, Loved By Many","Dipa Ma is a fascinating woman and this book is an easy read about her life and told by some of her students that learned from her. She had a very hard life, faced many traumas including having her young children die. She came to a point where she had to do something about her pain or die herself because of it. She began meditation and that is what saved her. It took her to a place that so few go and she was able to find her true limitless self and attempted to teach others how to do the same. She was able to see through her suffering and become a true sage. There are some interesting things in the book about siddhis she developed as well.I am only giving it 3 stars because I have read other spiritual books or books on meditation that had a greater impact on me. Those would include Ramana's works, The Ashtavakra Gita and Perfect Brilliant Stillness."
4,well done!,"The book is a well researched subject on a leading master of Buddhism. What made it very unique was the subject itself - a suffering and helpless girl who overcomes and completely transforms her life with meditative practice. The transformation from misery/desperation to joy/loving compassion, that Dipa Ma went through is definately worth reading. A very inspiring book!"
2,Charger broke.,"The battery charger broke after only a few times of use. I tried other batteries, and it still wouldn't work. Good thing I have a back up charger.The flash itself is basically a 'you get what you pay for' accessory. Don't expect superb results, but you'll be satisfied.EDITThis thing is so cheap. I dropped about 3 feet out of my pocket, onto grass, and the red plastic broke. It is supposed to be ETTL, but it's off almost all the time, even before I dropped it. You're better off buying a manual flash and doing it yourself."
4,"Excellent flash, for the price","This flash is the best bang for the buck out there, for a Canon DSLR. It is super easy to use, and points in all the directions one could possibly need for bouncing a flash for indoor photography. This flash is an excellent value, and a great flash. It's a little bulky on the camera, but for what it can do, that's not a problem."
4,Good for the money,I am new to this photography thing and very much an amateur so I don't want to spend a lot of money to get a good quality product. I read the reviews before purchasing and they are right. This is a good product for the money and gets the job done. I can't wait to take more pictures!!!
4,Phoenix DZBIS-112i Flash- nice unit,"Bought this for my wife,s camera for Christmas. The camera top flash was just not cutting it in dark rooms. WOW, what a difference. I am no camera buff, pretty much a novice. My wife, on the other hand, is an art director for a media company so she needs good lighting for the pics she takes. This light works very well, as advertised. I would recommend it for most users. The case is plastic and may not hold up to hard pro use but for most people needing great lighting and ease of ue on a canon, this is a great light for the money."
2,Was good for a minute,"I purchased the flash a year ago. It worked just fine for about 6 months. It would only flash in about 1/3 of the times it should. It later began to flash less and less. Now it is just a big gamble whether it will flash or not. I'm sorry I purchased this product, eventhough it was the best priced at the time.I can assure you I will spend the extra money and buy a canon flash next time."
2,It's Ok.,"The good thing about this figure is, it is a new Batman, sort of. The bad is, we've seen this before. Basically, it's the smaller JL Batman on some serious steroids.It lacks detail, articulation, and creativity. It looks more 2 dimensional than the cartoon itself! The paint job is horrific on many of the figures. This is definately a series you will want to hand pick yourself, so you don't get stuck with figures with a bad paint job....."
3,"Looks great, but not the best toy ever","I bought this Batman, as well as the Superman from the same series, for my three-year-old. They are really great looking toys, but for play, they aren't that hot. As others have said, the toys are poorly proportioned, and don't stand well on their own. Also, they are barely articulated - no elbows, no knees, etc.My three-year-old thinks they are great at present, just because of the way they look, and they certainly are well enough built to hold up to him playing with them for over six months now. But I don't think they're going to be very exciting, as he gets older and other options are out there."
2,no sexy party here,the toy is cheap made and the women in back do not understand right. beware they do not even do free shipping when pay over 25 dollars.
3,A sense of Capote,"Letters are interesting to read and you get a real feeling for how needy he must have been to be loving everyone so much.I think it is better to read his biography first, so that you know who the people are in the letters. It's a little confusing otherwise. That's what I plan to do."
2,Quite disappointed by this book,"When I bought this book I wanted to find out what the truth is as far as the Antarctic area on the Piri Reis map is concerned. The fact this book was written by a cartographer could shed some light on the issue. Reading the book I became very disappointed by it. The writer knows his maps, that is for sure. He describes the map and the errors found in it in great deal and you can learn a lot of that. But the writer also seems biased on the Antarctic subject. His pictures seem to prove the opposite be he still claims the Antarctic region on the Piri Reis map only coincidentally resembles the real thing."
3,the traps of appearence,"I have bought this book as a present for a close friend who's very keen onthe subject and I have translated it into Italian.I must admit I did not know anything about Piri Reis until he spoke to me about the subject and I did not know anything about cartography too. However, I have soon got involved and I appreciated the translations of the inscriptions on the map and the description of Colombo's journeys and personality, but also the objectiveness of the author.The book is written quite fluently although quite ripetitive at times and it is obviously very technical.As the general trend is to stop in front of appearence, being an easier way to live ,this book represents a good chance to go deeper into a part of our history and definitely learn something interesting.There is no other similar and recent evidence available on the market about this subject, therefore I would recommend it to amateurs and beginners like me."
1,Not the worst TV show ever.,"I bought this because I thought it may be an entertaining spoof on Bush's blunders and so forth. Instead, it is more BASED on Bush but not really about him, or about anything. This is not the worst TV show. I say that because a TV show can only be so bad. Once it gets to the lowest level, then it is tied with all the other shows that are at that level. So, this is not the worst show ever. However, it is TIED with the worst shows ever. Another way of putting it is that it is in the same class as the worse shows ever. Meaning, it is absolutely horrible, painful to watch, insanely un-funny, terribly acted and written by total idiots with no talent. All in all, I would describe it as ""shockingly bad"". Meaning that it is beyond me how any human being could consider it to be entertaining."
5,thats my bush,"this is to much crap to write, i won't be doing this again but i loved the dvd it was perfect"
5,Absolutely hilarious and daring!!,"Even though the Bush Administration is winding down, this is still absolutely funny. I can't believe they got away with the eight episodes they did produce. It was almost like ""The Spitting Image"", but with live actors. Whether you are a Democrat, Republican, and Independent, or whatever else, if you need a good laugh, this DVD is for you!"
5,Great book,An excellent and well written book. The writer understands how to apply lean tools to a realistic low volume high mix environment. He avoids the 'trap' of modelling off the auto industry and makes simple and realistic suggestion. After reading it - I bought two more copies for people in my organisation
5,Excellent Start for Culture Change,"This book is an excellent start to navigating a lean culture change. David Mann challenges you to change your ""management system"" in order to change your culture. Once focus is put on the ""management system"" you can observe, and measure impact which will then translate into cultural shifts. The book is well written and full of concrete examples of actual implementations as well as roadblocks."
3,I expected MUCH MORE,"When i read the reviews of this collection, it has 5 stars, i bought it expecting the greatest progressive rock i ever heard. But i was very disapointed, it contains more than 50 songs, and just 25 or 30 are good. The classics groups (Genesis, Yes, ELP) offers the best tracks in set (Procol Harum, Wigwam,PFM,Argent and many more tracks are too good.)But i found many tracks that has nothing to do in this collection.I am a prog fan and this collection i own like that, but i think this is not the best of the Progressive rock era."
2,What?,"Archie Patterson, who compiled this strange collection, cannot seperate Progressive Rock from any wierd sounding music. Plodding psychedelia, wierd instrumental music, quaint/eccentric pop tunes, hard rock anthems and bad acid jamming clutter up this box set. The few real prog songs that turn up [Dancing With The Moonlit Knight, Perpetual Change, Karn Evil...] you probably already have in your collection, so why bother? Pink Floyd and King Crimson did not participate in the set, but why no Kansas, Starcastle, RUSH [? ], early Utopia, solo Steve Hackett or Rick Wakeman? A half baked effort."
1,the worst box set I have ever heard,"If I could give this zero stars I would. First of all, I'm a big fan of Yes, ELP, Genesis, Gentle Giant and Roxy Music. I'm not one of these people who hates this genre. This box set is incredibly depressing; it makes me question even the music I love. For example, it's great to hear Genesis' The Musical Box, but surrounded by terrible music, it sounds overblown and pretentious. Same with Karn Evil 9 and others. It feels like it was put together by someone who secretly hates progressive rock. Just because something is obscure doesn't make it ""bloody glorious"" as the Amazon reviewer put it (he probably doesn't like progressive rock either). If you are a fan of interesting, complex, very musical, exciting music, don't touch this box set with a ten-foot pole - it's a huge waste of fifty bucks."
3,What do you expect from a compilation,"Every review (mine included) talks of bands left off and ones who shouldn't be there.This is partly because, WHAT IS PROGRESSIVE ROCK??? Define it. Hard isn't it. ELO are here with a orchestral version of Chuck Berries classic. Is it Prog? Idon't think so, although they could be considered a prog band from their early albums before they went poppy. As stated by another reviewer, some bands are left off for due to who owns the rights and thelike so we can complain, but there is nothing we can do.In all honesty I reccommend you buy all the albums the songs are on than this set as you will only wind up getting them anyway.Hope I've been useful... Toodle Pipskie (is that how you spell it?)"
3,Not what I expected,"This book had helpful information but was a bit too dense for me. A lot of things in the book are also outdated. I ended up selling it shortly after the class reunion. (Note: Of course, individual results may vary...my reunion was a flop, but not because of this book.)"
5,Another great read!!!!!!!!!,"Absolutely loved this book, the best of the series. I loved the ending with all the family joined together for Christmas. It was great to see them all again after reading their individual stories. I wish Jane would write more on the Galvan's. Surely with Tino how he was there has got to be more son's & daughters about we haven't met yet. The possibilities are endless."
1,ONE DARK AND STORMY NIGHT,"7 BELOW is a real mess. It's plot is incohesive, derivative, climaxing in a senseless denouement. 90% of the film is so dark you can't see what's going on. And what about the radio that plays even when the power goes out? The acting is abyssmal. Val Kilmer with his anachronistic ponytail keeps putting nails in his cinematic coffin; Ving Rhames gives a laughable homage to the villainous Tony Todd and MattBarr should've stayed on Harper's Island.And where did the title come from?Basically one to avoid."
1,"Awful, no need to say more","I just want to give this one star, not wasting anymore time on it. The other reviewers did a good job of telling the usual stuff we've seen a thousand times. I'll add this, if you're looking for a horror movie to see something new, this ain't your movie! I think they gathered up the most worn out horror stuff they could and threw it all together and out came this. I'm only interested in one thing, what the heck happened to Val Kilmer? I don't get it, this is the guy who was beyond incredible in tombstone and others. He looks like a bloated pig! And wtf is with the hair? How is he going to get movie roles when his charector has to have hair down to his as*? That alone limits him, who wears a pony tail now, at least a man? That looked like crap on a guy 40 years ago, it sure does now! Val, get it together. And don't know why rhames wasted his time on this junk. Maybe it paid well? They promised only a day of shooting? Had to be something!"
1,Not worth the time spent making it,Bad acting by everyone and badly written. The lines were awful and redundant and the plot done has been done before.
2,ehhhh,Not a great movie. predictable.Not great acting at all. Don't waste your money rent it if you want. I regret buying it.
1,TERRIBLE!,"The other 1 star reviews are right on. I'm very disappointed in Val Kilmer. WT big F? Ving Rhames plays his part ok, but it doesn't matter. The whole movie is terrible and just CHEAP. Stupid."
2,Wait for the horror combo pack,"Based on the cast(well Val Kilmer & Ving Rhames), 7 Below looked like it might actually be pretty good. It wasn't. It wasn't scary. It was mostly just boring. Ving Rhames is a joke, every scene with him is oozing cheese(the stinky kind) & one can't help but roll their eyes at him. Val Kilmer is barely in it, despite the cover. The whole thing centers around a house where a family was murdered by a young boy, the reason for which is never really clear(is it the house, is it the boy or someone/thing else?) & now that it's been a hundred years...blah, blah, blah... you get the picture. Anyway, my advice is to wait until it's part of one of those multi-film horror packs, they're cheaper & you don't feel as jipped. Sorry if I've somehow ruined it for anyone."
2,Lame,"This is the type of movie you produce when you have a car payment to make. Val oh Val, where fore art thou Val???"
2,Had potential....,"...but did not live up to it. The actors did the best they could with a very weak script. The plot is nothing new, the setting is a cliche, and there are no major surprises or thrills. And Val Kilmer just looks horrible."
2,"Draggy, Dumb, and Doesn't Deliver","One of those films with no real surprises and a very incomplete feel to it. It seems the makers wanted to create a brand-new, really frightening haunted house film, had some interesting twists and concepts to work on, but didn't quite know where to go with them, so they just did the same old thing that's been done a gazillion times before. The bells, chimes, and rain pattering on the roof might have served to create tension and atmosphere 50 years ago, but not today. Vivid cinematography, believable dialogue, and pretty good acting (most notably Rebecca Da Costa as Courtney), but we don't know the too-plentiful characters well enough to attain much empathy with them. ""7 Below""'s stronger points are wasted on this boorish attempt at Southern Gothicism.Buy something else."
1,HORRIBLE.,"I'm sorry I wasted my time watching this movie. I thought it was supposed to be a horror movie, but there was not a single part that was the least bit scary. I also didn't understand how two people could spend one night in a haunted house and the next day be deeply in love. The plot wasn't even good either. All around, a terrible, terrible movie."
2,c minus flick,"Only got this film because Val Kilmer is in it, and he was killed off early...the film is boring,(he even looked bored!) no thriller here. Didn't really care about what happened to the rest of the characters. Dialogue leaves much to be desired. Much of the acting was almost like just going through the actions, stilted and very unconvincing. Other than that it was great"
2,2 stars only for Zero Mostel,"My G-d, this is awful. The five star reviews could only have come from the filmmakers themselves. Zero Mostel has a few hilarious comic bits, but they are all too brief. The dialogue isn't much, but Zero makes up for it with his wild gestures, inspired vocalizations and elastic facial expressions. It's a truly a case of an actor being so brilliant he could actually read from the telephone book and make it artful and hilarious. I wish Zero had performed the Yellow Pages rather than this script."
3,Totally Silly,This DVD is funny and yet silly at the same time. I love how they put some 80's movies like 'Dirty Dancing' and 'pretty in Pink' all into one crazy movie.
1,AWFUL,"It is an insult that they try to pass this off as comedy. The story was none existant, and the acting was appauling. As if movies like ""Scary Movie"", ""Not Another Teen Movie"", ""Date Movie"" and ""Epic Movie"", and all the other nauseating cookie cutter sequels they spawned weren't bad enough, VH1 puts out this 90 minute borefest. Instead of doing the same lame obvious ""jokes"" over and over try coming up with an original comedy. This is not even worth 1 star."
5,Great all around 80's spoof...,"Dominique Swain steals the spotlight from the rest of the actors and she doesn't even know it. Her girl-next-door appeal and good looks make this movie a joy to watch. It's worth the rental fee just to see Dominique. She has a bright future as an actress.Often-times intentionally annoying, over-acted and over the top, Totally Awesome! takes you back to the 80's by spoofing not only popular movies of the decade but clothing styles and anything and everything else you'll probably remember, and some things you've forgotten. It doesn't take its self seriously at all and you shouldn't take it seriously either. Just pop it in the DVD player and have fun with it."
4,A cult classic (at least in my memory),My friend and I Watched this years ago and couldn't stop laughing. I got a used copy of it on here to remember the giggles. It worked.
2,Disappointing Work by Ms. Pella,"I finished this book today and I have to say it is the only book I've ever read by Ms. Pella that I found difficult to read through. She was overly descriptive and she tended to just simply overdo it. Normally I love to read historical fiction but this book is the exception to the rule. The most disappointing part of the book was the ending. Though I know it is part of a series I was very put out that not a single thing was resolved by the end of the book. I guess my overall opinion of the book is that it was on the boring-side. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead the 1 felt it actually deserved is because I did truly enjoy the characters- Cameron, Blair, Jackie, Johnny, Alex, Gary and Sam. I just wish she would've wrote more about them and less about their surroundings."
2,I felt cheated...,"This could have been a good book. I felt very cheated after reading nearly 500 pages because absolutely nothing was resolved. I don't begrudge the fact that this is part of a series, but I also believe that books in a series should stand on their own. We were left hanging with all three sisters, not one part of their situations were resolved. If I would have known this, I never would have spent the time reading the book. I don't know how long it will be until the next in the series is out, but by then I will have forgotten this book."
3,Spode Hurricane Candle,"The hurricane holder is a nice size and weight, however, the glass had many bubbles in it. I also bought the Spode pitcher and it had the same problem with bubbles/flaws in the glass. I have other Spode glass pieces that are just fine with no bubbles in them. I am not sure why these pieces had so many noticeable bubbles/flaws. It definitely takes away from the beauty of the piece."
5,Beautiful window display or centerpiece,"We bought this Spode candle for Christmas in our new house in 2006. It makes a beautiful window display or table centerpiece and this is a very good price for a Spode item. Note that the pattern is printed on the outside of the glass, so be very careful not to ""scrub"" when washing it."
4,"Nice ""Reference""","I'm generally not a huge historical recordings classical music fan, but I do enjoy listening to the great musicians of the past. Sir Thomas Beecham didn't record much Mozart in stereo, so fans of the English maestro (like myself) have no choice but to go back to the old mono performances. This CD collects three Concerto recordings all from the 40s -- Flute & Harp with soloists Rene LeRoy and Lili Laskine respectively, Piano No. 12 with Louis Kentner and Violin No. 4 with Jascha Heifetz. (Unfortunately I discovered the last recording is also included onThe Master Violinistwhen I ordered it -- I hate duplication!) The bookend Concertos from 1947 have much better sound than the Piano from 1940, though its audio shortcomings really only appear in the Andante section. Overall, this is a nice ""Reference"" release and fans of Beecham and/or Heifetz should enjoy hearing these greats in their prime."
5,Southern Truth,"this book is a must have for anyone studying southern writers. This is a book you will never finish reading. Pick it up, open it, start reading and you are there, in Stanford's south of the 1950's and 60's."
5,Amazing,"I don't really know how to describe this other than to say its very beautiful and full of pregnant phrases, as the surrealists might say. Evokative and quite beautiful with a strange beauty."
3,OK,"This pillow is too thick to put under your neck. It does have a little pocket that you can pull some of the extra filling into to make it smaller but with it being so full of fiberfill, it is too small to fit a regular persons neck but works OK if you pull some of the stuffing out of the little pocket that is probably there for that reason. It does help if you need to relax your neck and ice it at the same time so I would recommend it just not too highly because it is stuffed so full and hard to fit the neck."
3,Headache Ice Pillow,I think the pillow is good for migraine and neck pain. It would be good if the pillow were a larger.
4,a BIG wow,"I listened to this cd at home and was amazed at the quality of the material. I am not much into Slinky but this particular CD made all the differences disapear. I would recomend you sample some music prior to buying this. otherwise if you know this type of music, just buy this."
2,Crooning Charlotte,"Even looking at the situation objectively, this CD was not a good career move for Charlotte. With her previous albums (namely ""Enchantment""), she established an insanely loyal fan base, which is incredibly difficult to do, especially considering her youth. It seems she tried to fix something unbroken.In my opinion, a better endeavour would've been a jazz album - something she could really sink her teeth into. She still could've been portrayed as ""sexy"", but in a better, much classier way. Her new look would work beautifully coupled with a jazz CD (minus the racoon eyes).""Tissues and Issues"" is frankly a disappointment. Her angelic voice is reduced to filtered crooning, and her lyrics are mediocre at best."
1,Very sad!,Charlotte Church had the most beautiful and captivating voice I ever heard when she debuted. I purchased all of her albums and played them to death. This CD is horrible! Her beautiful voice is no more as she makes no attempt to even use it. Some of the other reviews said this release is the result of her growing up. Ridiculous! She could easily have kept the angelic voice as she grew. This is simply a tragic waste of talent!
