2,Not the best product to buy...,I put this product on my baby registry and received it for my baby shower thinking what a great idea but when I put it to the test when it came time to bathing my son in the tub it was more of a hassle than a great idea. The suction cups that are suppose to attach to the side of the tub do not work at all and the the rubber feet at the bottom of the base come off everytime I move the stool. Now the only thing I hope for is that it will be a great stepping stool for when my son needs help climing in & out of the tub.
2,Not Deep Tub Friendly,"I really wanted to like this mat and elbow pad set. Unfortunately, we have a really deep tub, so the sides are tall and the cute little piece in between the elbow pad and mat isn't long enough. I use it, detached from the mat on the bottom because it does save my knees, but I can't use the net because now it is flimsy without the bottom attached and won't hold anything. So, if you have a deep tub, just get the bottom part, otherwise, it will just be a waste of money."
2,Not as functional as I expected.,"If you have shower doors on your bathtub, the elbow rest may not stay in place. Our shower doors glide on tracks along the tub edge. The elbow rest does not stay ""hooked"" in place over the edge of the tub because of these tracks. It's a constant battle throughout a bath session to keep tehe elbow rest in place and utilize the cushioning.Also, since it's constantly falling off the tub edge, I cannot use the storage pockets in front. Everything falls out of the pockets when the elbow rest falls off the edge.Finally, the kneeler is comfortable but not as useful as it could be. To store the elbow rest and front pockets you need to reconfigure the kneeler - not something I expected to to have to do everytime. Also, there's not as much storage in the kneeler as I expected because of the construction design.For the price, I would not buy again or recommend to others."
2,disappointed,We had an item called the tubsider for our daughter (now 6) so I knew we needed something to help when bathing our son. This item isn't practical or very helpful. The kneeler part is nice for me...but for my husband it creates more of a back issue because of the bend needed to reach over into the tub. THe arm rest is constantly falling off the side of the time too. Not worth the money...I could've rolled up some towels to get the same benefits.
4,Life saver for my knees and elbows,"This thing is great. Especially since I have a Japanese tub,which are very tall so it's hard to bed over it to reach my kids to wash them. Unfortunetly the net doesn't reach all the way but how many people have Japanese tubs! I love kneeling on the stool and knowing when i go to stand up it won't be hard! The elbow rest is great too. I highly recommend it for anyone with babies to bathe! I would have given it 5 stars if the net reached."
2,Safety Issue,"I recently purchased this product to ease my bach aches when bathing my 3 year old son. It definetly relieved some of that uncomfortableness, however, the problem I encountered with this product is the top portion (elbow pad) adhering to the side of the tub. It does not always suction properly and often times would fall off the edge of the tub. The other day my son tried putting it back and suctioning it to the side of the tub. There was a little moisture on the edge of the tub, the top slipped and he slammed his mouth onto the top of the tub. He sustained a severly cut lip and jammed his top front teeth. There was blood everywhere. His teeth are loose now but should be okay. His lip is healing up but he was in pain for quite a while. I would like other parents to be aware of this potential accident in hopes that their child will not be injured."
2,Doesn't fit my tub,"I didn't register for this and I quickly realized why. The part that drapes over the side of the tub does not fit my 70 year old bath tub, the fabric wasn't long enough. The blue pads on the bottom of the kneeler fell out and the plastic that was left scratched the floor. Buy a styrofoam pad for gardening...cheaper and more comfortable!"
1,Ban this from the computer ewaves,I unfortunately hear this on a digital service and I just have to get to the next selection before..... When I was much younger I remember Ms. Callas as being touted as a great voice. This does not do her memory well!! EMI should have done a much better job of selecting and re-mastering.
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this for the beads. The hemp that came with it was enough for 3 projects. I found many of the beads to look extremely cheap. I only wanted to use about six of the different designs. The design instruction booklet was easy to read but in no way helped in showing knots. Thankfully, I learned off a you tube broadcast and was able to teach myself."
5,Very Good!,I love this book very much. What exquisite stories and beautiful illustrations! I have discovered a lot of things through these five short stories. Each story has a truth of life.
3,Altogether one at a time,About a boy who is having a Birthday party and has to invite someone he does not want to.
2,50 going on 17,"The truth is I was disappointed with this, it is the first and will be the last so termed ""Digital Comic"" I will buy, I much prefer true animation."
4,A Good Read,"Thoroughly enjoyed the book... and the whole series in fact.Easy to navigate.Interesting to see what ERB wrote about in his time, considering he has levitating vehicles, auto pilot, homing devices, etc. as some of the stuff that is in his books.Unfortunately not all the books are available for free. So if you like these you'll want to find the whole series of 11 books, but not all the ""complete"" series available are truly complete."
5,Book three is more ferocious than the first two.,"Sometimes the first three books are referred to as a trilogy as the first two books have cliff hangers. Of course we know this is not the end due to the number of book written.In this part of the story we left John waiting at the Temple of the Sun. Everyone knows that he as not long to wait until his old nemeses' devise a plot of revenge. Soon John, while in the process of chasing the capturers of Dejah Thoris, will come up against untold and unfathomed barriers to the end of the world. Luckily he has old Woola at his side.Reading this make you want to get out you sward and join in.Still as with all places ruled by law, John will have to meet with the Judges of the Temple of Reward ad face the consequences of returning from the Valley of Dor and the Lost Sea of Korus. As no one can escape judgment."
5,Triumphant Trilogy,"I loved this book. I loved the first three books. Yeah you wonder why they don't just shoot each other instead of swordfights to the death and the whole backdrop of how he gets to mars is odd today but the sense of wonder and the audacity of the ideas he keeps throwing at you page to page is just fantastic. The tech is odd but must have seemed astounding at the time. Kept in context this book is truly amazing. Compared to today the descriptive tech and the swordfights are odd but the rush of ideas, cliffhangers and all make this the King of cliffhangers.I AM SURPRISED HOW MUCH I REALLY RECCOMMEND THIS BOOK TO OTHERS. THANKS TO DAD FOR RECOMMENDING IT TO ME."
5,Yet again.,"Edgar R. Burroughs is such an exceptional and imaginary writer. His ideas and visions were well ahead of it's time. The John Carter series has woken the inner child in me. I am truly looking forward to the next installment, which I will be starting after submitting thus review. Long live the Jeddak of Jeddaks, the Warlord of Barsoom, John Carter."
4,"More Swashbuckling Adventure With the ""Other Virginian""","I haven't read these books in more than forty years, so to re-read them now is like having read them for the first time. John Carter really is a dope sometimes. I knew waaay before he turned around that Deja Thoris wasn't behind him anymore, but that's beside the point. These are really such fun books that you have to love them. Burroughs' language and style is almost laughable, but it's a fine specimen of the breathless writing that made the pulps so successful in their day. And if you don't get the reference to the ""other Virginian,"" search for Owen Wister."
3,Alien action hero,"I came into this series starting with this book. I was unsure about what to expect. It took a little while to get acclimated to who was the good and who was the bad, and how they all worked together (or against each other).The book is basically one HUGE fight scene. It has pretty awesome descriptions, and is endlessly creative in the people, and places he visits on his escapades. There is never a boring moment, and there are very few breaks in action. Read it at a time when there will be few interruptions because it is hard to put down (as the hero is almost always in mortal peril)"
4,Warlord Mars,"It is just fun, that John Carter can come back to earth and tell his experiences on Mars and that go back to have more adventures."
4,On Guard,"Fun Read! Mystic space travel, mysterous immortal person, lots of sword fighting, and some very wierd aliens. Very fun to teh point of being silly."
4,Very satisfying!,"I felt really good while reading the third book and I really loved the ending. Somehow the adventures managed to stay fresh even when they were outwardly the same. (Even though John Carter gets thrown into yet another dungeon, his experience and rescue is original.) I really liked the description of a camera that could take a picture and have five copies arrive at five different places that are all far away! I can't imagine anyone reading the first two books and not following them with this one but I'll make it formal: I definitely recommend this book."
4,Warlord,"Typical Edgar Rice Burroughs fare, easy reading and fairly enjoyable, but very predictable. Product was delivered in less than an hour as promised."
4,I think i like it,"This is a quick read that is action packed and villains you live to hate. I killed it in an afternoon, it's that easy."
2,Broke before using,"I was very disappointed. This looked real nice, however, looks canbe deceiving. The item arrived and the packaging was good. It was wrapped in its own wrapping. When I took it out of the wrapping and went to set it up it fell to pieces. I would not recommen this to anyone."
3,cookbook holder,works fine but had to repair one of the hinges. The piece of metal that fits into the hinge sections came out and had to be replaced with what I could find to fit.
4,Just as expected,"No complaints, just a little smaller than I thought it would be. I still recommend it. Word word word word."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I just got this in the mail, and was excited to use it, but when I opened it, it was already broken. It is a cheap piece of junk. It seems poorly constructed, and the wedges that hold the corners together were already coming out. I would send it back, but I don't want to pay shipping back to Amazon. Luckily, my husband is handy, and can probably put it back together to where I can use it. Spend a little more money and buy a better constructed product!"
2,It came broke,"The item was for my husbands birthday. Not only did it come in with the plastic broken, the hindges were also broken. It appeared that it had already been returned, and just put in a box and shipped to me. I was very disappointed"
4,"wider than it is tall, and not ideal for loose recipes","I was surprised when this arrived to find that this cookbook holder holds the book in quite an inclined position, such that it takes up a large amount of counter space (8 x 12.5 inches, nearly a square foot), not happiness for small kitchens. I was assuming it would stand more vertically than it does.Also there is nothing behind the acrylic other than the open frame to hold one's recipes. This doesn't matter if you're putting a book under the acrylic, but you'll need to stick a board or something behind any printed-out loose recipe page or card if you want to use this product to protect those.The particular item I received arrived with a gap or crack in the bamboo frame as well. Such is the sad quality of so many products these days.That said, the acrylic is clear and smooth and I can read through it easily. I hope I like this more once I've had it a while."
3,Cheap but works,The holder works. But it has a cheap feel to it and looks as though it cost about $3 in supplies and labor. For the money it should be more sturdy and look nicer.
1,Bamboo Acrylic Cookbook Holder,"It is functional but it doesn't hold paperback cookbooks very well and not very good with single recipe pages. It keeps falling down. I wish I had paid a little more for a sturdier Holder. I know, I know, you get what you pay for but I hoped for better from an eco-friendly manufacturer.Zebrabird"
5,feeling 1971,"Probably one of the greatest records from the eary seventies.Best part is no-one knows about Vincent Crane on organ/bass/vocs,John DuCann with his heavy riffs and sceaming leads and Paul Hammond as the soulful drummer.What sets Atomic Rooster apart is the funk sensibility that can be heard on songs like 'Sleeping for Years' and 'Gershatzer',nevermind the dark,heavy title track that gives us a peek into the gloomy life of ""normal"" people."
5,This album's intensity is staggering to say the least.,"Never thought I'd ever see or hear AR's work again-its been over 20 years since I heard the Death Walks Behind You album. Having listened to and seen some pretty amazing acts over the years-(Doors, Zeppelin, Black Sabbath) this compilation of songs really brings out the ""dark side"" moreso than the aformentioned groups. Not taking anything away form the likes of Morrison, Plant and Page and Ozzie and Geezer and the boys, AR's Death Walks Behind you album completely isolates a person from what is happening around you-sort of like that chocolate bar commercial ""I'm not coming back until I'm done"" routine. Once this album starts you shouldn't dare try to do anything else-just get comfortable. It this album doesn't have what you're looking for, nothing ever will. There will never a another album like it."
3,"Sorry, ""in Hearing of"" still tops it","As to Stuart Caley's (what's your email?) review on ""In Hearing of Atomic Rooster"" where he referred to my review, there is indeed some sax or brass on the piece ""Rock"" as testified in the included booklet. More importantly, his review made me buy ""Death walks behind you"". There is doubtless some good Guitar playing by Du Cann, but it just so happens that when I yearn for heavy guitar playing, I turn to Joe Satriani, Santana, Robin Trower, Deep Purple (Made in Japan), or AC/DC (Men in black). My favorite Atomic Rooster album remains ""In Hearing of"". It is one of the few albums without any weak moments, every song is different, the organ playing is marvellous! The only two albums of similar organ-dominated style and quality I can think of are ELP's Tarkus and Greenslade's Time and Tide. Any others? Let me know."
1,Not worth reading,"The author of this book clearly doesn't give a lick about the people he is ""protecting"". This book is the ramblings and reasearch of a man who is on a quest to find as many things wrong with this particular subject as he can find. His only goal is to paint the gloomiest possible picture, a very simplistic form of writing. Anybody can do this on any subject by being selective. One of the most unworthwhile books I have ever had the misfortune of buying (used thank goodness).If you like diatribes, this book is for you and you will be suitably amused. Otherwise save your money and just use good common sense."
1,a consumer's misguide to alternative medicine,To summarize the book in one sentence: Every medical approach that is not based on traditional western midicine is by default bad or suspicous.
1,A Poorly Written Book...,"The author, a de-licensed psychiatrist, wrote this book with no qualificatiosn whatsoever. He has no understanding or education in alternative medicine. The book is merely the rant of an uneducated dimwit. Given the author's lake of qualifications, it is not surprising that the content lacks any evaluation of actual treatment. The fact that Psychiatry and traditional medicine has been under fire for some time for its ineefectiveness is completely un-addressed. The book's content is so malicious particularly in that it attempts to keep people who need effective altnerative medicine from getting it. If you really need to learn about altnerative medicince I wouldn't bother with this book."
1,Biggest quack,"Barrett has no qualifications to judge alternative medicine. He is clearly a lobbyist for the status quo. If you are interested in alternatives, you will not get any useful information here."
3,A bit uneven,"I really like Kent and Isola is a quite good, but I prefer the swedish version, maybe cause I'm swedish ;o). This album contain a few great songs, ""747"", ""Things she said"", ""Celsius"" and ""Unprofessional"". Unfortunately there are some not that good songs ""If you where here"" and ""Glider"". So, the general impression is a bit uneven, but it's a good buy. The swedish version is a FOUR STARS, cause it harmonize more to the music. Keep your eyes open for the new album that I believe will be reliesed in begining of december -99. The new single ""Music Non-stop"" is promising."
2,"A ""Let Down""","Someone compared Kent to Radiohead, which is what led me to immediately get this album, but I was thoroughly disappointed with ISOLA. The first few tracks are good, and definitely Radiohead-inspired, but the album quickly falls off thereafter, sinking into sappy, American radio-friendly lamentation. Reminds me of Third Eye Blind ballads or something avoidable like that. Easy to listen to, but stay clear if you are looking for a truly impressive journey. Buy a Marion album instead for Radiohead-inspired pop gourgeousness."
3,"Not that good,not bad either","When i first heard Isola i thought 'now there's an album that does it's job properly'.I wanted to hear some nice pop rock songs and that was exactly what i heard.Some were melankolic some more uptempo like the trully wonderful single 'if you were here' and the next single 'things she said' which travells you with it's melody.But the problem occurs when you don't want to listen to the same pop rock songs over again.Kent aren't original,they just write good songs that have been written again and again.Comparisons with Radiohead are disregarded as not serious.Radiohead have written timeless songs that will be heard from generations to come.That isn't to say that Kent aren't good.You will find what you search for here.The question is if this album will keep you comin' back for more,and the answer is well,no!To sum up this review i must say that i don't regret having bought Isola.It was a good company.Just dont expect The rabbit to come out of the hut with this one!"
1,Typical alt rock,"My buddie Dave and I have pretty similar music tastes, so when he recommended this one, I ran out and got it the next day. Came home and played it a couple of times and was left scratching my head - what's he see in this? Sounds pretty much like every other alternative rock band out there today - perhaps a bit darker. Played it off and on all week even held on to it and tried listening to it a month later to see if I missed anything - nope, still don't get it! It's not a bad disc per se. The production is good, the quality of the music is good, they even throw in a lot of nice sounds - piano, cello, violin. But it just sounds like anything else on your local ""alternative rock"" station. Take any song from this disc and put it on a Gin Blossoms, Goo Goo Dolls, or Oasis disc and you won't be able to tell the difference. And that, to me, is worse than poor production or musical quality."
5,Deacon knows music. I am Deacon.,"If you are tired of the same old sound(matchbox 20, Eve 6,) you have got to check this album out. I must warn you however. If you are not looking for a musical experience than you will definately not want to buy this album. It blows the doors right off of this trendy American Crap(listed above). Now can you dig it?"
4,"stop the comparing, for the love of GOD!","For those who are fans of the likes of good rock music, I highly suggest buying this album. You shall not be let down. I would place them in the same category as Radiohead and Travis, but I would COMPARE them to no one! I am so sick of this comparing...especially to Radiohead! They weren't the first band under the sun! Anyway...Kent is pleasing to the ear. Also check out their new album...Hagnesta Hill. Very sexy."
1,Not going to do that again.,":( I have sensitive skin. This lotion has a irritating ""cold burning"" sensation. Yay menthol. I didn't get a close shave and i didn't want to shave with it because it felt like the razor was dragging across my irritated skin.I was going to return my shaver until I tried the HQ170.The HQ170 moisturizing shaving lotion is much more comfortable."
5,"Great product, protects skin and smells good!","This product combines perfect with my Norelco advantega razor. I have very sensitive skin and this gel makes mine very smooth so when I shave it doesn't irritates my face and to be honest, this has been my all time problem. With the Norelco advantage and this gel, my problems are gone. I trully recommend it.The only down I found on this product is that it doesn't last to much shaves."
4,Nice and cool,I prefer the Gel to the lotion - it feels cooler on the skin and without the greasines.For some reason I don't seem able to find either in a local store. Yay for the internet...
1,I didn't like it...,... and the alternative lotion (HQ170) is far more soothing on the skin providing an excellent shave with no facial discomfort.The Norelco shaver came with two samples of each cartridge and I only used one of the Gel cartridges... I really can't see a point in using it.I've ordered boxes of the lotion!
5,Super Smooth,The year before last I was given a Philips Norelco Cool Skin Shaver. I tried both the Nivea cream and gel cartridges. The gel seemed to work better out of the shower. If your like me and need a mirror so you can see what your doing use the gel. This is a great product and I haven't found it anywhere cheaper than on amazon.
5,Smooth Nivea...,"The shaving gel works great on my beard providing a clean, clear cut in and out of the shower. I have no problems with it."
5,Nivea Gel Cartridges,"I have a Norelco razor that uses either shaving lotion or shaving gel. My personal preference is the gel. As I get older, I need more moisturizing and the gel helps provide it."
4,Cool Skin Nivea gel gets the job done,The gel works great and allows you to moisturize the face for a close shave.
2,wow,"i got this, and was like wow, this is tiny.. the image on the larger view was life size... huh, would you look at that... i spent 60 bucks on something tiny..."
1,For die hard Blondie fans,"14 tracks and only two memorable and good songs (""Nothing is Real but the Girl"" and ""Maria"") in this coming up record of Blondie. This album doesn't take Blondie to a place that they haven't already been to. There is also an awful rapping from the Gangsta's Paradise guy Coolio in the title track. Still, ""Nothing is Real but the Girl"" is a good and strong tune."
4,"Thank god, no astaire or kelly singing on this one","This was a great listen and it was finally nice to hear trained singers doing Porter. Can't stand it when I hear a lilting Porter song in an MGM film and then Astaire or Gene Kelly decide to try and sing it, usually off key, and end up slaughtering the number. Great to hear some of the old stuff and different takes on other standards."
2,Al lovely operatic voice HOWEVER,"MR. HAMPSON, IT AIN'T GRAND OPERA! I PREFER FOLKS LIKE SINATRA, MARGARET WHITING, JO STAFFORD, AND SO MANY MORE."
2,"What a voice, i've never heard such a great one like this ..","Thomas Hampson is the great one of the last decade. I only have one of his cds, but that is more than enough. I do plan to buy more of his cds in the future. I can hardly wait.Let me tell you what I know about Thomas. He has a very powerful voice. It is truly a pleasure to hear him sing any kind of music. He really knows how to entertain the listner. He sings in a very understandable style. It seems that he is always smiling when singing, even on his cds. I feel like anyone who hears his voice will be a fan for life. I ask that everyone give him a chance to showcase his voice.The only reason for not rating this cd higher was because of the repertoire. I'm a big fan of a popular repertoire.I Would Like To Recommend This Cd"
1,Would not eat it.,"This is my first negative review of a product but I felt I should leave a comment. If I could give this cat food 0 stars I would as my cat simply walks away from it. Worse yet, when I leave a plate out at night on the front lawn for the strays simply to get rid of it the food is still there in the morning. I depend on reviews from Amazon and this product was no exception I don't know what happened but I certainly won't be back again."
1,Underwhelmed,"I bought this book as a reference for a seminar and was very underimpressed. Though it's 421 pages, the last 306 pages are appendicies of 15 different APA guidelines for treating people of certain populations. Don't get me wrong, these guidelines are important to good practice, they are simply not what I was looking for in a book about thriving as a therapist.The text of the book, it turns out, is about 112 pages of mildly to moderately useful information. I am returning my copy and looking for something useful as a reference."
3,"Good, but too many questions, not enough suggestions!","I know, we all understand the importance of questions, and theirs are good ones. However, some sections of the book (especially Chapter 7) consist almost entirely of strings of questions, with relatively few recommendations. The practice guides and other information are helpful, but are less practical than the information to be found in the second book I bought (after being disappointed in this one), Holly Hunt's excellent book, ""Essentials of Private Practice."" Her book has much more on practical matters: billing, collections, and office procedures."
1,bad vocals kill this track,"I was very disapointed when I listened to this CD, I had heard short samples over the Internet and it sounded like a good track, but the samples didn't include those really annoying, awful vocals that repeat 'I love you mama"", and to top it off the dub version also has those vocals and is not really a dance mix like the others, which I have to say would have been excellent without the vocals. And what is the last remix? I woulnd't be buying Da Hool if I wanted to hear that kind of music."
4,I read it in a box-I read it with a fox-I read Silas Marner,"The plot of this book was very anbsorbing. At the end, I had to remember that I was just the reader and not in the book. I read sixty pages to read the conclusion. Also, George Eliot(pen name for Mary Anne Evans) has a way with words that is amazing. She uses specific words that give the reader an exact image. Though the sory was great, George Eliot needed to describe the characters greater detail. Other than Silas Marner and Eppie, the characters were left as vague beings with specific personalities, but no physical characteristics.:)"
3,"This may be a sleeper, but it has a good message","I especially liked the discussions of how religon can interfere with being a good person if one is not careful. Overall, it is kind of boring, but the touching message is nice."
2,Pleasurable but deathly slow,"In retrospect, I actually enjoyed the characters of the book. They were very well developed and had great depth. However, it was a chore to finish.The book started and ended with me spellbound, but the middle was the slowest I've read. Overall, I wouldn't say I hated the book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anybody but the most PATIENT reader."
3,Required reading for 10th graders,"so sorry that i accidentally got my loaner book wet and had to buy a replacement. the cost for this product was a little much for such an ""old"" book, but was sure glad to find it so that I could get it replaced!"
4,surprisingly well read,"I was worried that I would not enjoy this recording after discussing it with my local librarian. I was very pleasantly surprised. In a few places, the language is a little tedious. Mostly, it is read with a lively colorful and varying voice, that brings the novel vibrantly alive. That is saying a lot since it is piece of writing that is almost 150 years old."
5,One of my favorite all-time novels,"I first read Silas Marner when I was 18 years old, and loved every word. I started reading it again immediately after finishing it! As said in other reviews, perhaps 9th grade is indeed too early because at that age, this older language style is difficult to ""get into"" quickly enough to hold their interest. I found myself wrapped in this little town with its odd characters and gossip, and wished I'd lived there. The imagery is so strong and sweet I still refer to the scenery evoked by this novel when I read completely unrelated historical articles! The story itself cannot be called remarkable because it is one of the basic stories about humanity and what matters in life. Yet George Eliot surpasses all others in the telling of it. There is a reason this book is on all the reading lists -- it is a great achievement."
4,consequences and superstition,"I use Silas Marner with many of the students I tutor because it so effectively portrays that there are consequences to wrong actions. In contrast, what is right stands out purely (Silas and the child). I also use Silas Marner to make students aware of their own predispositions toward people who are ""different""...people they don't want to know. The superstition of the townspeople toward Silas Marner reveals the common human tendency to deny a stranger his own personal history by conjuring one for him. This is an excellent book, especially for pushing young people to THINK!"
2,Book Review for English class.,"do not recommend this book to anybody for a number of reasons. First of all, it is very boring and reading can become extremely tedious at some points. The storyline and plot is actually very interesting, but I think that if Eliot had presented it in a less descriptive and detailed way, it could have been much easier for a larger spectrum of readers to comprehend the messages she was attempting to transcribe through this story. This is definitely a selection that should be avoided by and young reader with any lack in patience or determination. This book is aimed much more towards scholars, historians, and English teachers."
2,a CLASSIC?,"I hadn't heard a single positive comment about this book until I came to Amazon.com and read some reviews. To me, Silas Marner was the book that everybody was forced to read in high school, and that everybody hated through the generations.Perhaps it is appreciated because of its interesting historical background...but now, it is OLD-FASHIONED. Not that an old, slower style of writing is bad--I have nothing against old books. What I imply when I say ""old"" is that we've outgrown this and expect more from books these days than a story like this.There are too many other excellent books which do a better job of exploring the same themes better to waste a few HOURS of your life in the pages of ""Silas Marner."""
1,Ugh!,"This is the worst book I have ever read. I picked it up and started reading, since I'd heard so many good things about it. After about 10 minutes, I found myself turning pages without reading or even skimming them. The characters are completely un-lifelike. The plot is terribly boring. No one should be with this dreadful book."
1,Not worth it,"I had to read this book for english class for some dumb reason. First of all it is really slow, secondly, I hardly got anything from this book, all I got was that if you think there is no hope there really is, and you dont have to read a long slow book with fluffy writing to learn that, you've probally heard it bfore anyways DON'T READ IT!"
1,Worst Book Ever,"This is the worst book I have ever read in my entire life. I read it as a freshman three years ago and still have not forgotten how awful it is. The only remotely interesting charachter is the opium-addicted woman and she dies at the beginning. I wanted to die every time I opened the book. Silas Marner is the most boring charachter ever created. Eppie has no personality once she has grown up and is an obnoxious child to read about. I have no idea why so many people love this book; it was on a list of the most boring books ever written- number 7. Don't waste your time with this story, and don't watch the movie because it is even worse."
1,I hate this book,This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The entire thing is practically one long sentence.
3,Eliot Sentiment,"This book is as sentimental as ""Middlemarch"" is complex. I found that the long introductory sections made for a difficult set up to the primary situation. The narrative involving the actual bond between Marner and the child were condensed and telegraphed so quickly that the reader is forced to take the author's word that there was an attachment. As a result, the emotional climax feels like a tear-jerker rather than an honest resolution of the characters' lives. It gives the impression of a 19th century ""Afterschool Special."""
4,this book was a great display of writing technique.,I feel that anyone who is interested in classics would also take a liking to this novel.
4,Old school reader,"Was pleased to find this old book, since my Dad and Grandma had one similar. She taught school turn of the century and left part of this book for us, so now I can read it myself, pleased."
3,"Countin' my money, like a true O.G.","A rather sentimental tale of the recluse who regained faith and the ability to love his fellow man. If this didn't have the name George Eliot on it, I doubt this would still be in print, cause honestly, there isn't much to see here (move along.) Middlemarch is fan-freakin-tastic, don't get me wrong, but this one is nowhere near to that status. The story itself is rather unexciting, and there isn't (to my eyes) a depth of examination by a probing mind to merit serious study. Poor kids, having to read this in school! There's so much better, so much more worthwhile...."
4,THE BOOK WAS HARD TO READ BUT WAS GOOD,THIS BOOK HAD A LOT ABOUT LIFE IN IT AND WAS A GOOD LESSON TO SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE A TENDANCY TO DO THINGS BEHIND OTHERS BACKS. SILAS ACTUALLY HAD A GREAT PERSONALITY AFTER EPPIE CAME IN AND OPENED HIM UP. OTHER PEOPLE BEGAN TO REALIZE THIS AND GAVE HIM A CHANCE. THE BOOK HAD A LOT OF CONTRAST. LIKE WITH THE ROBBERY IN LANTERN YARD AND THE ROBBERY IN RAVELOE. ALSO IT WAS MYSTERIOUS I GUESS YOU COULD SAY BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT DESCRIBED CHARACTERS AND THEN LATER WITH THEIR ACTIONS SHOWED WHO THEY TRULY WERE. I AGREE WITH OTHERS THAT THE ENDING WAS NOT ALL THAT GREAT BUT I GUESS THAT IS OKAY. I WOULD HAVE NEVER READ THIS BOOK IF IT WEREN'T FOR MY PRE AP ENGLISH CLASS.
5,A Beautiful Story of Loss and Redemption,"I have to begin by saying I took a Victorian Literature class in college about 11 years ago. I had to read this book... and I did not like it at all.As another reviewer mentioned, I am now thirty and read it again. I now love this story! It is a story of loss, love and redemption.A miserly Silas Marner loses the one thing that makes him feel complete, at least he thought it did. His stash of Gold gone Marner opens up to the people around him for the first time in years. He also meets the little girl who changes his life forever.Silas Marner is a story about finding love and learning how to love someone else. It is also about the miniscule value of possesions as compared to the relationships we can build with those in our lives.Read this book... If you read it before and hated it, or have never read it... It is well worth your time. This classic story written by George Eliot (Mary Anne Evans) will change your view of the world."
5,"Silas Marner, by George Eliot",Silas Marner is a classic. Once you come to terms with the old English the characters take on an intertwining story of symbolism and intrigue. A great plot dealing with human nature at it's best and worst. A good story of any age.
3,XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX,XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXX xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI do not want to rate this at this time. I would like the option to comment if I feel strongly about it one way or the other.
4,Silas Marner,"Good story, definitely some interesting twists I didn't expect! Pretty good story all in all, an easy to read story, but the contradictions make it a little confusing. Not my favorite, but I would read it again"
2,Very advanced reading.....,"I don't really care a whole lot for this book...mostly because in 9th grade advanced english at school, my first high school experience, I was forced to read Silas Marner. The language and literary context is very deep and very advanced...it's a struggle at first to read until you get used to the flow of the book. This is definitely a book that you cannot read/skim like you can in most others. You have to carefully read and think about every sentence in order to comprehend the plot. The book gets better about half-way through, where more conversation takes place and is easier to follow. The worst aspect of the book, in my opinion, is the sentences that run on and on and take up entire paragraphs and in turn, the paragraphs that run for pages. All in all, the book was OKAY, but I don't really recommend it for pleasure reading."
2,required reading for freshman in HS,This is a classic book but it is really hard for Freshman to grasp due to the Old English style of writing.
2,"I'd throw it away, but then I'd worry that some homeless person might get stuck reading it","I can not describe how painful this book was. The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl. This book stands out in my memory not just for instilling a loathing of the written word that nearly took my away from literature for the rest of my life, but for the great amount of negative space it left in my brain when I try to recall some of the ""excitement"" of the drudgery of Silas's everyday life.Truly a GREAT classic to unload on junior high children."
1,A Review On Silas Marner,"""Silas Marner"", the main character of the book, began as a normal person in society. Silas enjoyed being very religious. A friend wanted to be with Silas's wife and he framed Silas for doing something he really didn't do. The town basically outcasts Silas and he finds a new community and is very quiet and unsociable. Silas weaves and collects gold coins in his new community. I read the book of ""Silas Marner"" and personally to me the book was not that great. It is supposed to be a classic, but I don't have a taste for this type of book. The story didn't seem to have much adventure or anything in it. When I think of a good book I should like the plot. I feel that the author in places went off describing the details and the scene to much that it made the book frankly boring and it didn't need to be told. Silas's lifesaving's in gold is stolen; he found a girl that ends up in his house, raised her and much more. Find out about the story in ""Silas Marner"" by George Eliot."
2,Silas Marner,This book is required reading for freshman in our high school. This version is very hard to read due to the Old English style of writing.
1,A sublimely boring and depressing book,"I am convinced that if they did not force people to read this book in tenth grade, no one would ever read it again. I love to read and I love books, but I hated this book in tenth grade and many years of life experience since then have not made it one iota more palatable.Please bear in mind that this review is purely based on my personal experience and weltanschauung. Your mileage may vary."
4,A little taste of Eliot,"So, you've savored Middlemarch and reveled in Mill on the Floss. What do you read when you're in the mood for the kind of witty observations and perceptively drawn characters you loved in Eliot's masterpieces? Though more sentimental and simplistically plotted than Eliot's other novels, this slight little fable is nonetheless a rich and rewarding read. It's perceptive, touching and written with Eliot's characteristic grace and gentle humor."
3,The miser that has a heart,"This book is considered a true classic. The story about a miser who was driven from his original home by false acusations to end up as a miserable weaver in a new town. His life changes when he finds a foundling and begins to care for her. It turns out the girl is the daughter of landed gentry who now want her and Silas does not to give her back. The story is not bad, but I do not understand why it is such a classic. I must be missing something because it was originally written in 1861. It is possible I am missing the forest for the trees in this case. It is a fast read and it is not a bad book by any definition."
3,Good but not great,"I'm a huge fan of George Eliot, and as always Silas Marner did not lack for literary content and great prose. If you've never read Eliot before this would be a good book to start since it's relatively short. On the other hand, I felt the story lacked the powerful dramatic ending I was hoping for, and so I cannot say it is one my favorites by her. All in all a good read that leaves you with plenty to think about and ponder when you look at your own life and what are the things that are most important to you."
5,Classic read- Silas Marner,"One of the best classics that have been written. I read this book when I was young, and forgot most of it. I watched the movie with Ben Kensley and it was so good that I had to read the book again. The book was by far much better than the movie and I recommend it to anyone that loves period pieces. I give it 5 stars!"
5,An uplifting story,"After Silas Marner's hoard of money was stolen, I was afraid this would be another dreary, Bronte-like novel, full of doom, gloom and cruelty. I almost decided not to finish it. However, I looked up a plot summary online and found that it was not so dark. I'm glad I went ahead and finished the book. The author paints for us all kinds of interesting scenes of life in a small English village in the 19th century. We read of virtue and vice, pompousness and humility, love and devotion, and even of good intentions backfiring.All in all, this is a pleasant read. The good are rewarded and the bad get their just deserts."
2,Why can't we read some CURRENT social commentary in school?,"I don't know about anyone else, but when I read a plot synopsis on the back of a book, I like for that story to kick in at some point. However, that's not how this book is written. The basic plot doesn't get set into motion until about 120 pages in...and the book is 183 pages. To put it bluntly, the first 120 pages are spent aimlessly pondering life's many riddles and offering sometimes interesting, yet mostly tiring social commentary (I really don't care how the people at the Red House and the Rainbow act similarly despite class differences. I just want to finish this reading assignment so I can actually enjoy my summer). A plodding, slow book for the first two-thirds, it picks up somewhat before somehow managing to wrap things up in 10 pages...making me wonder why the book is even this long in the first place."
1,Not a classic,This book is billed as a reproduction of a classic edition of Silas Marner. It appears as is someone just scanned the pages of a classic edition and bound them together. There is no warmth to this edition. The pages are overwhelimingly bright white with a reproduced page in the middle. Doesn't even have a book title on the edge binding. This is not the edition for anyone who loves the warmth and comfort of reading classic books.
3,"Good lessons, but dull","Eliot is clearly a master - I've read ""Mill on the Floss"" and loved it, and I look forward to reading ""Middlemarch."" However, ""Silas Marner"" was a bit of a disappointment. The supporting characters are well-drawn as is the town, which is really the star of this book. I found the character of Silas Marner to be vague and unbelievable. His growing isolation is described in a fair amount of detail, but his transformation is glossed over too quickly. It is simply not believable that someone who shuns others would be so willing to adopt a child and change so quickly. The message that love can transform even the most hardened person is beautiful, and the ending is wonderful, but I found it difficult to make it through most of this book."
2,"great writer, insignificant book","If compared to Eliot's best (Middlemarch, Mill on the Floss), Silas Marner is almost a disgrace. The brilliant literary style of Eliot seems all but gone, and the story could have easily been dispensed with in a form of a short story. The story, taken on its own, is heart-warming. But there is so much ""background noise"" to contend with. Overall this book should be a definite miss, even for Eliot fans (like me!).In addition I'm quite surprised this novel is used as part of the English literature curriculum in many schools (here in England at least). I feel sorry for those young minds having to wade through this. I hope schools will choose Mill on the Floss instead despite its length."
4,Silas Marner,Read this as a Sophomore in high school. There was much I had forgotten. Really enjoyed rereadingthis literature classic!
4,Silas Marner,"A classic I first read in High School. It's a little difficult to get started but once the story starts to unfold it's hard to put it down. There is a reason this story is still being read, it is good literature with timeless lessons in life."
3,Interesting story,"The beginning of this book was slow and long. The writing style was somewhat difficult for a 9th grader, and the sentences tended to run on. Almost an entire chapter, in the beginning, was about a long, dull conversation almost irrelevant to the story itself. When Eppie enters Silas's life, however, the story becomes more interesting. She makes the characters more interesting, and the whole story more enjoyable. The large development of Silas in the beginning to the end is apparent and important. The few final twists at the end also make it a story worth reading. Therefore, this book was a good classic and should be read by those interested in historic England."
2,Sluggish at best,"I couldn't bear reading this book for long periods of time because I would fall asleep. It does have a theme and a moral, although a seemingly generic one at that. I don't want to overly influence anyone's decision to read this book, but think twice if you don't like extremely slow moving books."
4,Silas Marner,Read it in high school but didn't remember it. Read it again and I enjoyed it much more this time.
5,"Silas Marner, the most compasionate Eliot Work","I loved the confusion in Adam Bede. And the hate and prejudice in The Mill on the Floss was astounding, even with all that, Silas Marner is the one that touched my heart and caused pain. This is a brilliant book by a brilliant author."
5,One of the Best,"Simply this is one of the best albums I own. I listen to a ton of post-rock / electronic / experimental / ambient etc. and '55:12' is one of my favorites (along with selections by Radiohead, Sigur Ros and Mono). The emotional undercurrent is deep, contemplative and really tugs at your gut. Every beautiful melody has a slow build and the climaxes are a tad muted so as not to overwhelm and make your ears wince.Wonderful stuff, and the track ""What I Can Manage"" alone is worth the price of the album."
1,Monroe shocks 32275,Was really bad shocks it's like old shocks just painting luck like new ones but really bad qualityin my opinion never going to buy this kind of shocks i recommend not to buy anymore this kind of shocks.very frustrated about this and unhappy
3,"Great book, but very poorly printed and bound.","I checked this book out from the local library and liked it so much I decided to buy my own copy. I was very disappointed with the book I received. Where the library book was printed on a glossy paper, with a sturdy cover and binding, the copy I got from Blueline, the publisher, looks like it was printed on a personal printer, has a very cheap looking, thin, cover, and is held together by just two staples! The contents are great, and I will use it, but wonder how long this flimsy edition will last. NOT AS PICTURED ON AMAZON. See if your library has a copy."
5,for the financial types,"If you're looking at this listing, you know what you're looking for - all the listing of banks and routing numbers. This book has the complete listing for American financial institutions.If you use that type of thing, this is a good book for you."
5,A Good Book,This is a well written book. Bishop Weeks is another great teacher of the Word. You will learn a lot reading this book.Recommended reading
4,Classic of Madness,"In a post-Hostel (Director's Cut)world this work still shocks with simplistic depicting of mutilation, murdering, suicide presented as entertainment features.Itself, no much links between filmed segments might be traced also joint by the same artists (characters?) participating.To a reviewer, it looks nowadays like Tower Eiffel placed besides the contemporary New York mirror-clad South Gate Central Park buildings.Respectful grounding classic of genre."
1,Dreamweaver MX Disappointment,"I found this book to be exceedingly slow to get started and very tedious to work with. While there seems to be a vast amount of information, the flow was awkward and the tutorials took too long to get to the point of anything. I am no stranger to web sites and instructional material so I was very disappointed to have invested in this book only to find it wanting.I believe we all learn best by doing and this book seems to take that approach, however, I continually found the book exploring the minutia of this very capable program, at the expense of accomplishing the stated learning goals."
3,FAiry Wings,"The wings are beautiful, but need support through the back in order to keep them upright."
5,Magic !,"I read this book a long time ago, as part of my schooling. Even at that age, I did not want to put this book down. This is a good one to pass on to young'uns, and alot of adults too. A must for the bookshelf me thinks."
5,"The ultmate war game, apart from this time with a real gun!","Just imagian a time when collecting war suveners made you the most popular kid in school, then imagan how popular you would be if you had a real and working machine gun with a couple of hundred rounds! Thats exactly what Chas McGill found apart from he did not use it to become popular he used it to kill Germans. This book was realy cool, but if I told you any more about it I would ruin the story."
3,It's Alright,I liked the machine gunners but it was a little complicated. Some British and German words I couldn't understand.
1,Waste of Money.,"This stud finder is virtually useless. Inaccurate readings galore. I now wish I'd have spent the extra money and gotten a better product. After numerous attempts, you get different readings for studs and the AC sensor went off constantly. Apparently my entire home is full of wires from ceiling to floor.(note sarcasm) Better off trying better quality."
1,Infuriating,"I bought this at Target, and made the mistake of thinking that because it was one of the costliest and boasted multiple features, it would also be one of the best. After trying to use it just now, I had to come see if it was sold here on Amazon and read what other people thought of it. I wish I'd seen these comments before buying; everything the other one star reviews say is true. What an utterly horrendous piece of junk this thing is. The company that makes these deserves to be put out of business."
1,Useless,Absolutely useless. Never worked properly. Seems to beep at random. Tried multiple times on different walls. Do not waste your money on this.The AC wire detection does seem fairly accurate.My son really enjoys playing with it though...
1,Don't Buy,"This thing couldn't find a stud if it were placed on top of one without a wall seperating it. I get readings all over a wall like there are studs everywhere. A true piece of junk. I followed the instructions and nothing worked. The only reason I give it one star is because I can't give it a ""no star""."
4,Hot!!,"This is the 3rd installment. It's hot and funny. The characters are very likable and believable.SHE HAD A LOT TO LEARN... Paige Cassidy is on a majOr self-improvement kick. Divorced from a man who swore she could do nothing right, Paige is making it her business to learn how to be a woman...in every sense. And sexy, restless Jack Mission is just the man to give her a few lessons in love......BUT SHE WAS A PLEASURE TO TEACH! Texas bad boy Jack Mission is tired of being a drifter. He's ready to find a good woman and settle down. And beautiful Paige Cassidy is definitely good--in bed and out. But Paige only considers their erotic interludes ""research."" She's not looking for a commitment. And it's up to Jack to convince her that she's already all woman--his woman!"
1,Was This Item Tested?,"A new coffeemaker demands attention to the proportion of coffee to water. The challenge with this product is that the measurements on the carafe and those on the water reservoir don't match - so unless one uses a measuring cup, it's hit or miss as to how much water to use. (The manual is still different.) I notified the company; they weren't aware of this - no one had complained. They acknowledged it, but have no plans to correct it. It's OK if one always makes the same amount. I don't so I replaced it."
1,Mirror does not fit 2000 Camry as advertised,"I took a gamble with an after-market part and LOST. The mirror does not sit flush against the car. As a result, air rushes in making a fantastic whistling noise. If I don't get it repaired before it rains, I'll have a soaking wet passenger seat. Don't buy this mirror for a 2000 Camry!"
3,Be careful ordering the right part!,"At first I was pleased to find an ""OE replacement part"" at a good price, but the price from partstrain kept going up. The least expensive shipping option was $12.Then I found that I received the wrong part. Partstrain will accept a return within 30 days, but you must find (buy)an additional shipping box to return the item (even though the box it was shipped in was in new condition). Then you must pay a 10% restocking fee and pay for the return shipping. This all adds up to a price more than double the original advertised price. It was actually cheaper to keep the wrong part!!!Partstrain took no responsibilty for their web site returning a list of parts unsuitable for my car. So you must be very careful when ordering a part."
4,Almost perfect,"Well worth the money for this new after-market part, which is a fraction of what the dealer wanted for a new part. The base of the mirror didn't fit exactly against the car body, it whistled when the wind got into it when I drove above 30 miles per hour. But it was close enough that I was able to use some U-channel car-door trim around the edge of it to fill the gap and stop the whistle."
2,Bad service.,With paying $12+ in shipping i would of thought they wouldnt get it shipped within that week but i was wrong. i ordred this product on wednesday and it didnt even go out till the next monday. It would be diffrent but this is an important part for a car. I sent the seller an email(friday) asking when it would be sent out and i have yet to get a reply. the seller fails.
3,2001 Camry replacement mirrors.,"The mirrors are nice, but the plugs don't match up to factory wire plugs (at least on my 2001). I had to take the old plugs and attach them to the new mirrors."
5,great service,This item was an exact match and installed easy.The only thing was that I wished I had more choiceswhen it came to colors.I really liked the fast devlivery and that I was able to track my order.I liked the transaction so much that I ordered an other one a week later.
4,A Good Biography,"This is a good biography of the facts surrounding the life of the amazing Helen Keller. If you're looking for story, this is the wrong video for you. This is a biographical presentation from beginning to end, and quite nicely done."
1,"Helen Keller-wonderful woman, terrible movie","This was not very good. I watched this for a class assignment, and even the teacher agreed it was terrible. I expect more out of a video doing a biography of Helen Keller. This was too biographical, and had terrible context. I would recommend instead the video HELEN KELLER IN HER STORY-one I watched years ago but still remember it well because of its excellence."
3,Mixed Sentiments,"For the $59.99 & S/H you will get 7 base pieces of molded plastic strips that you attach to your own table (hardware is included). You will also receive 10 other strips that slide into the base pieces, after you attach them to your own 1x3s.Though the product works like they say, I feel that the product is grossly overpriced for what they provide. No, I'd have to say that the product is OBSCENELY overpriced."
4,Jesse Colin Young - Songbird Review,"I first purchased this as an album back in the seventies and have loved it ever since! Classic sounds, great harmonies--I've never gotten tired of hearing this album. My favorite cuts are ""Again, and ""Slick City"". Sit back and enjoy..."
4,Jessie Colin Young -- Songbird,I saw Jessie at Oakland Stadium with Joe Walsh and Crosby Stills Nash and Young in the 70's and am still a strong fan. Great music and lyrics! Glad to find this hard to find cd at Amazon.com!
5,Songbird,I absolutely love this CD. It took me forever to find it and was lucky to locate it at Amazon. It arrived in perfect condition! I may need to get it again soon as I listen to it so often!
3,Not the original mix.,"I wish this album was the remastered original, not a remix. Some passages sound better, but there are a lot of missing pieces and parts that are just completely different. I don't like the way the guitar tracks were submerged, or replaced with alternate studio tracks altogether. The original mix has been released! Buy it instead."
2,Huh????,"Umm, Huh? Many of these songs sound WAY different from the old cassette I have of this album -- especially one of my favorite songs by Rory -- Ain't too good -- this version is missing the lyrics from the bridge entirely!!!NOT what I was expecting when I got this CD. Look for the original -- much better versions of the songs."
3,How John Wayne became John Wayne,"Randy rides alone, as with most of John Wayne's B westerns is a depression era, low budget vehicle that has to be watched carefully. while the plot may not stimulate the senses, take the time to watch Wayne. In these B westerns, he is actually perfecting the John Wayne signatures that would make him a box office champion in the years ahead. It was during these films that he for example, perfected the patented spin of a colt revolver as it leaves the holster. This ""trick"" he would later use to add a razor's edge to the role of Ethan Edwards, in John Ford's 1956 classic ""The Searchers"". If you are a Wayne afficianato, you will pick up many of these things as you watch ""Randy rides alone"". These traits that in this reviewer's humble opinion, make this less a B western than sheer John Wayne 101."
2,ALL OF JOHN WAYNE'S LONE STAR-MADE WESTERNS ARE THE SAME,"A YOUNG MAN NAMED RANDY [JOHN WAYNE] GETS ACCUSED OF MURDER WHEN HE WALKS INTO A CORPSE-FILLED SALOON. AFTER A WOMAN HELPS BUST HIM OUT OF PRISON, HE GOES ON A QUEST TO FIND THE REAL KILLERS AND CLEAR HIS NAME. IF IT HAD MOVED FASTER, I WOULD'VE DEFINITELY LIKED IT MORE. BUT, SINCE IT HAD TO BE HEAVY ON DIALOGUE ON SHORT ON ACTION, THIS WESTERN FAILS. JOHN WAYNE REALLY SAVED THIS ONE."
2,"maybe ok for very basic spanish, but no more.","my neice was moving to Miami Beach and so i bought this for her. she called me up laughing b/c there are phrases like: lie down and give me all your money! and other such nonsense. garbage mostly, but for the occasional tourist i supposed it'd be ok, esp if you plan on robbing someone!shipper/seller: very fast shipping, ty so much!"
1,secondhand !,"The translator that i recieved , although bought new was obviously second hand ! I tdid not arrive in its original packaging , did not have a battery protector , so God knows how old that is and had a dirty screen and scuff marks on it !I had to have it sent to my daughters in USA as for some reason it couldnt be sent to Spain . Very poor altogether."
1,where are all the words...,"in one day of owning this thing i've found it doesn't have the words...-- dwarf-- beech-- oak-- twin-- wigalso, having _no_ gender for the nouns in inexcusable. there's so much potential for a good electronic translator, i can't believe this think made it to market... i have no respect for franklin, now i'm off to see if langenscheidt makes electronic translators."
2,A helpful tool,I haven't looked at it yet but will do so when lessons begin in a week or two. It was ordered as a crutch!
2,Careful: Very small vocabulary,"This device is small which is good. It isn't always the most user friendly but works fine once one learns how to use it.It has a very small vocabulary in spite of its claim to have many thousands of words. When I read Spanish text that is classified as Intermediate, I find only 1 out of 5 words that I want to look up in this dictionary. These are straight forward words like ""bankrupt"".This device is useful only for someone who needs basic vocuabulary."
1,Very disappointing buy.,"The misleading promises of an enormous word and phrase bank for what appears to be a favorable price will surely lure you. However if you buy the product you will quickly discover the true nature of the translator and be deeply dissapointed. The translator can not process even basic words, and the phrases are sometimes grmatically incorrect. This product is a waste of money and will trully make you regret your purchase."
3,Good product for the price,"Limited to translating single words and short phrases, but I carry this to refresh my memory. Good for using on the road, it fits easily in a pocket, and is durable too. Not a tool for learning a language, but a lot easier than a paper dictionary."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"This translator was a complete waste of money. It's not even worth $9.99. The majority of the words I looked up were not in there. The word ""dog"" is not there either. [...] is a great source on the internet to translate from English to several different languages and vice versa."
1,A true piece of garbage.,"I'm sorry that this translator cannot be rated less than 1 star. This is a completely non functional piece of garbage. Of the first 10 words I typed in (from ""The Easy Spanish Reader"") this device only attempted to translate 2 of them. It did not define these two words, it only used them in phrases.For the other 8 words it listed possible spelling corrections. The words were spelled correctly. I assume that these simple words were not in this dictionary.It may be that the software makes the assumption that all spelling is incorrect because the buttons are so small that it is next to impossible to type anything correctly.Verbs seem to be identified only in the infinitive. Actual translation are rarely given.Buying this device should never be considered."
5,Excellent Baroque,This is a very nice set of CD's. It gives you the extract of some of the best composers of the era. I particularly like Vivaldi. I only wish they could make a more extensive sample of the other composers that were not included in the selections.
4,Yellow 10 is showing the wrong wings,"This book is very good except the wings on Yellow 10 in the book are the wings that belong to the D9 at the Air Force Museum. Yellow 10 is now in the Flying Heritage Collection in Everett, WA with the correct wings on it. The error was found after the pictures were taken and the wings were corrected. There are no patches or covers on the leading edge of Yellow 10's wings."
2,Gun Belt,"I like this belt OK. It looks good. But I needed it to help support carry of a 1911. It is not a bad belt, it is just not thick or firm enough to carry something heavy. Not good for the purpose for which I bought it."
2,Gun Belt? Not hardly.,"Bianchi has been around and is well known for thier gun leather, so I mistakenly thought this belt would be appropriate and provide adequate support for use with a concealed carry, outside the waitband holster. Not so.This belt is made in Mexico. Leather thickness varies from .133"" to .155"". After a month of wear, the belt is sagging and showing areas of ripples and weakened areas in the leather. I'm not overweight (waist 33, 6'1"" tall), so I'm not putting any undue or unusual stresses on the belt.If you are looking for a belt for utility use, to carry a weapon or other tools that may weigh more than a cell phone - - this ain't it. Bianchi has outsourced their product and quality."
3,belt,Belt color was not what I expected. more orange than brown. Weight-lighter than most carry belts. would not buy it again...
2,Bianchi Belt... Not so much,"The belt seems nice enough. I'm not sure what qualifies it as a belt to be used for carry. It's not any heavier than any of the other ""normal"" belts I have (although it is more expensive). As one other reviewer mentioned it is also ""oranger"" than it appears to be on the website. Sizing also appears to be smaller than normal. It's not awful, but not what I needed, so back it goes."
3,Not the most interesting but I liked it.,"Bought this DVD for its storyline. It is a kind of movie I like, where the characters beat the odds against them and triumph. But nothing really outstanding."
4,Skeptical of the Skeptics of Skeptical Inquirer,"I admit out front that I'm none too familiar with this publication, but I do find it amusing that the two 1-star reviews so far are by people who identify themselves as 1) FruityAsANutcake and 2) Alien Worlds Wanderer. ROFL"
1,Why bother?,"A very, very boring magazine. You read one and you read them all. Just remember this, ""it can't be, therefore it isn't.""That pretty much sums up the whole boring philosophy of this unglamorous, pompous, lacking all excitement, our poop doesn't stink, organization. Ugh."
3,Worth the purchasr price but have read better,"This was off the beaten path of some of the motivational books I've read, (A. Robbins et al). It's aphorisms that were on every other page were enlightening, humorous and enjoyable if you like that sort of thing, and I do. The religious overtones, and the meditative qualities of this book lacked something for me. If your looking for that sort of thing I suggest Deepak Chopra's writings. This is good if your in the mood for ""Motivation/Meditation Lite"". I have since purchased 2 more of his books, so I suppose that says something else positive about this book!"
4,another self-help great,i love this book. it was very motivating and the quotes were helpful. i'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone
5,Spectacular,"Wonderfully witty and poignant for any stage of life. I needed this book and it appeared (literally, i just noticed it on my bookshelf one day - no idea where it came from!)...You can read this book straight through or open randomly for an enlightening refresher."
4,Excellent book. Fun and easy to read.,I really enjoyed this book. It's a quick read even though it looks large. I read straight through it and now am planning to go back and do all of the activities. I also loved all of the great quotes.
2,It is somewhat helpful,"This book just gets you motivated for a while, but it doesn't last, i'm glad I bought the book for the meditative things, but this book didn't change my life very much."
2,Sucks big time,"It is condiscending and totally irrevelant, with some pretty absurd mind tricks shown and a lot of big claims. I was glad when the blasted thing got lost in a renovation so I did not have to finish it."
4,"Powerful, politically-charged punk rock","While the tempos occasionally work their way into a thrash, the playing is surprisingly rock oriented (especially the guitars, with actual solos!) and the vocals on the Social Distortion side of punk - hoarse but melodic. This Seattle band has a lot to say, about American society's passive acquiescence to its government, warped political leaders, street culture, drugs and underclass, and the generally shattered dreams of America circa late 2004. Powerful words and powerful playing with a lot of variety, including punk Sea Chanties ""The Sleaze of the Seven Seas"" and ""Pieces of Eight"" that bring to mind The Pogues."
3,OK,"Its ok, nothing special, last track Pieces of Eight is a good song... Other than that? Its ok, not what I expected from hearing just Pieces of Eight."
4,Good Book for Beginners,"This is a very easy to read book. Beginners will find it very useful to learn object technology. The downside is that instead of focusing on just one topic, it tries to cover too many things like GUI development and other things. That's why I gave it a four star.I really liked the association matrix method of finding associations between classes. Simple explanations such as Methodology = Tool + Process + Notation that is explained with pictures is really nice.I was shocked to find some of the diagrams being drawn like those that you will find on an email discussion without formal usage of UML notation."
3,an OOP design book that uses Java,"I got this book from reading the user recomendations here. I just want to warn people this book is about 900 pages long, and the whole book goes into making just one program (a student registration program for a university). If you have the patience to read a book like this, fine, but for me its a little too drawn out, and nothing I saw thumbing through the chapters jumped out as being interesting or trying to make a point. I have read ""Head First Java"" and recommend that book for someone who is trying to make sense of OOP.Edit: I want to update this review by saying that I was too rash in critisizing this book. This book does do a good job of explaining how to plan and organize object oriented constructs to address real world problems rather than just a nuts and bolts overview of OO syntax that most other Java books give. This book however is not a ""how to program in Java"" book. You are going to have to move on to other Java books to become proficient in coding."
5,A 'must read',"Having tried to master Java before, I found that all of the books I consulted taught Java syntax without really explaining how to structure an application around objects so as to truly leverage Java's power as an OO language. This book accomplishes what no other book, to my knowledge, even attempts to do: that is, to step through a case study from beginning to end, illustrating first how to think from the perspective of objects, then how to model the application using UML, and finally, how to translate the model into working Java code. It is, in my opinion, a 'must read' for anyone striving to become an accomplished Java designer and developer."
1,Big disappointment,"I got this book and went through it before I took a Java programing class because the premsie of it is that you should learn object design before programing language. Without a knowledge of Java, I found it very hard to understand the OO concepts as presented in this title and would not recommend it as an OO book unless maybe you already know the language."
2,Good explanations but a faulty premise,"Being new to both Java and OO, I thought this would be the good book for me because the author says that you should read her book before a beginning Java book like Beg Java 2 or Thinking In Java. She is wrong! I tried and struggle very much with OO until I went and read beginner Java book and then read this book again. This is not to surprising when I think of it. Would you try to teach a child grammar before they can talk? Even the WROX book tree on FatBrain shows that you should read their Beg Java 2 book before this one, but the author says different. I think you should though that is just my opinion."
3,A Great Book For Non-Programmers,"I guess I already learned what this book has to offer by chapters 5 & 6 in CJ2, using the API docs, and looking at the Java Source Code for the API.This book is too basic for _PROGRAMMERS_ (who grasp things quickly) and they will be bored. I guess I feel that if you need this book, you probably shouldn't have chosen programming as a career. A programmer needs to be resourceful and be able to figure out complex puzzles in a reasonable amount of time. This book walks you through ""tediously"" step by step in agonizing detail the four or five main object oriented principles.That being said, for you non-programmers, this book is great and probably just what you need (hence the 3 stars). If encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance are buzzwords that you don't really fully get and can't explain in detail what each is, yet regularly use in conversation, this book could help as well.Different Strokes for Different Folks."
5,Best introduction book on Java,Before reading this book I have read about half a dozen of Java books. I am also a Sun Certified Java programmer. But after reading this book I have totally changed the way I looked at Java as a language. This book will help you to use an object oriented programming language properly. Especially if you have structural programming experience this book will help you to design and code in an object-oriented manner.
4,Good primer on OO programming,It's an introduction to object oriented programming using Java. It does a fine job of covering the various steps you MUST do before you sit down to write code. The first few chapters deal with the design phases of a project and would be helpful to any object oriented language.
3,This Book Has A Place In Your Java Library,"This is a good book that uses the clever device of starting with theory rather than with actual Java programming. The theory is well written, but any theory is a little hard to follow as it gets more complex, unless you have a lot of hands-on practice to put with it.I find that many of the Wrox books tend to have less hands-on practice than some other publishers. And many of the Wrox books get a ton of favorable reviews. I guess that either people like books that do not have a lot of practice examples, or something else is going on.I have read 5-6 Java books. This comes out somewhere in the middle for my purposes."
1,Disappointing,"A very disappointing rendition by Bernstein and the VPO, lacking in finesse, articulation and cohesion. Though the sound is acceptable, the colour is faded and hazy, with a washed-out look, especially in the camera long shots. I also dislike Berstein's demeanour on the podium, his prancing about takes attention away from the music. Not recommended."
4,Everyday Greatness,"The guru of principle centered living, Stephen Covey, has designed a great resource! Its called Everyday Greatness, and it is a wonderful description of all of the principles that Covey has shared with us over the years through a lot of short stories. Stories from great writers like: Maya Angelou, Jack Benny, and Henry David Thorough are coupled with excellent commentary by Covey. The book inspires us to live by three simple choices each day: 1. The Choice to Act 2. The Choice of Purpose 3. The Choice for Principles. The idea of living by positive choices is nothing new here, but the stories are simply amazing and inspirational. This would be a great addition to any classroom teacher's collections, minister's library, or employee's human resource library!"
4,Nice Bit of Encouragement,"I enjoyed the book, Everyday Greatness by Steven Covey. It was actually a compilation of short, encouraging stories about some famous people, and some people who were not famous but made a difference in the lives of others. I especially liked the quotes at the end of each chapter, but was a bit perplexed as to why a Christian publishing house would publish this considering Covey is Mormon and many of the quotes are from non-Christians, even atheists. This is a rather large book, at 434 pages, so its not one to read in one sitting. Its the type of book you'd leave out on the coffee table and pick up and read when you need a bit of encouragement."
3,EveryDay Greatness,"This book had a lot of inspirational stories about common, everyday people doing extraordinary things in extraordinary circumstances. I loved the stories, but was put off by the editorials at the end of each story. I prefer to form my own opinion of stories like that.It was a good and easy read and I will probably read it again (while skipping those editorials)."
2,Dull Stories...not the most meaningful,"The book Everyday Greatness by Stephen R Covey, was a book compiled of short stories that are supposed to inspire and motivate you to do great things with your life. Each chapter has three stories and a wrap up and reflections by Stephen Covey that gives you things to think about from the stories you've read. There are also quotations from various famous people that have to do with whatever topic you are reading about. Honestly, I wasn't inspired by most of the stories I read. The only story that was really worth reading was The Cellist of Sarajevo, but overall the stories were just very dull. Also, some of the stories really didn't go with the topic that Stephen Covey was presenting like the one about Pope John Paul II. The quotes at the end of each chapter were interesting, but at the same time kind of overwhelming because there were so many of them. I couldn't wait to just be done with the book. I really don't think this is a book worth spending money on."
5,Covey never disappoints,"Written along with very good Reader's Digest examples of stories about Courage, Attention, Meaning, Perserverance, and other virtuous qualities of man, Covey as well as a good collection of quotes from notable leaders, brings these virtues to you in a very compelling way.Get the book, read the stories and use the examples in your own lives to make a difference in your own unique way.Highly Recommended."
4,A motivational and inspirational book,I have enjoyed this book very much. It has a number of wonderful stories that motivate and inspire. Covey adds his insightful commentary which is thought provoking and appropriate. The buyer should understand that this is a compilation of Readers Digest stories and NOT a Covey book per se.
4,Good Resource Book ... Short Stories,"As a long-time subscriber to Readers Digest, it has always been a pleasure to read through stories of ordinary people who have achieved more than anyone expected. This collection, compiled by David K. Hatch is a well-organized compilation of these stories.While I enjoyed Stephen Covey's commentary and reflections, I actually found the compilation of quotes at the end of the chapter much more helpful. As a public speaker, I am always looking for good resources of inspiring stories and quotations, and this particular book is an extraordinarily rich source. I enjoyed reading through the stories, and will be keeping it at hand for the future.I received a complimentary copy of this book from brb.thomasnelson dot com as a part of their book blogger book review program. All reviews through this program are solely the opinion of the reviewer."
4,TAJ,An excellent book if you care forhistory and love story interwind together.You will be thinking about how it was liketo be an emperor and a prince with all theglory and big families and really in true love.
3,Music handbook for students and general readers,"This book explains Notation, Rudiments of Theory: Harmony, and Counterpoint, and Elements of Composition"
3,Another straight to ScyFy classic!,"Easily one of the worst science fiction films ever and I say... bravo! The writing, the *cough* acting, special effects and overall lack of anything that could be remotely considered a coherent thought, let alone a plot, all make for a movie so bad its hilarious. If you're a fan of bad horror or sci-fi movies I suggest getting together with some like minded friends, throwing back a few adult beverages and mocking this movie relentlessly. Ineptitude on this scale is truly an awesome sight and will lead most people to wonder why they don't have a job making movies if this disaster can get made. It could be the best time you ever have watching an unwatchable movie."
4,It's not Scottish and it's crap,"If you enjoyed ""Pteradactyl"" on SyFy, then this movie is for you.The only real downside for aficionados of SyFy movies is the lack of silicone and peroxide.It's tremendously bad and it tries too hard to be ""schlocky"".As another reviewer said, some of the special effects are almost passable!But it's so over the top it comes back around to entertaining despite everything the producers, directors and actors can do.Minor spoiler that plenty of others have mentioned.*A shark leaps and bites the Golden Gate Bridge.Why? Good question.Are there any other questions? No? Thanks. Good night."
3,Corney,"As expected this was an amaturish attempt at creating a""monster"" movie from fictional prehistoric beasts let loose when the ice thawed. A little homework would have been in order - Carcharodon did not exceed 60 feet. And a stock film clip of the Battleship New Jersey should not have been used to identify a destroyer. If one ignores the more than occasional faux pas, the poor acting, and the general inanity it was entertaining."
1,this is a high school project,This movie is just awful.I watched it for fun and it was painful to watch the whole thing.Graphics are poor.Plot is poor.Acting is bad.There are alot of political inserts.comments against USA politics.- water boarding- global warming- save the whales.pass this by. burn it if you own it.
4,NOT your mother's KING KONG Vs. GODZILLA !,"Stars: Deborah Gibson and Lorenzo Lamas.Okay,Yes...There is all the hype and a great commercial.Deborah Gibson actually steals this movie from time to time, When you're not watching the monsters chew on the planes-boats-scenery.The plot is pretty interesting and gives "" A-ha!"" moments,The love story explores a little of normalcy in an otherwise over the top scenario.Most of the attacks are great in execution (Literally),But some seem rushed and let down...They is a balance and even more for eye than the coming attractions hint.We could not pick a favorite monster,Was rooting for Shark then Octopus put the squeeze on and showed some hand to hand ? ,Tentacle to Tentacle combat tenacity.So,If there was a scorecard...A +,Theasylum delivered more than promised and Lorenzo Lamas kind of showed up to be part of Deborah Gibson star turn."
3,A 'campy' made-fo-tv monster movie.,"This was a movie I saw on TV a couple of times. It isn't as good as the 'classic' sci-fi movies (THEM!, THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA, etc.) but caught my fancy. The story line was simple, yet well done...two pre-historic creatures frozen together in the midst of a fight-to-the-death battle. When thawed they quickly separate, reek havoc, and eventually return to the location where they came into our world to finish their battle. The human characters are quite good, also."
5,Major Cheese,"Take a foul mouthed marine biologist and an ancient Shark and Octopus and what have you got? A major laugh fest that will brighten your afternoon. Lorenzo Lamas plays a character in this cheese bomb of bad special effects. The DVD version has all the inappropriate language you can tolerate. The script must have been written on a laptop at Starbucks. I want to apply as a screenwriter, because as a fan I could write a better movie. The only thing I would have taken out is the profanity because it makes this otherwise cheesey good movie look bad."
4,What can I say,"This movie got a lot of hype from simply the trailer alone. I mean I havent seen so much hype for a straight to dvd/blu ray release (or sci fi channel). The movie itself is just mediocre at best...but thats what made the movie fun to watch. Yes some moments were stupid but I enjoyed almost every second of this.The movie had some cool scenes like the shark lunging at up a plane in mid flight. One problem I did have was no special features. Would've liked to see something.Bottom line...Rent or buyPros:-For a syfy channel movie, its fun-4 words...shark jumping at planeCons:-No special features-Can get corny at times"
1,Wow.....This Was Even Bad In My Opinion!,"OK, I'm a classic sci-fi/horror fan. I adore so many of the films from the 50s and 60s that most critics and die-hard fans hate, but this film was more than this 'B' film fan could endure!I can honestly say, if you viewed the trailer for this film, you saw the best aspects of it! This film really could have been a lot of fun, given the idea, but I can't even say I had fun watching this one. Very flat an uninspired acting, bad CGI and probably the worst mistake....no eye-popping kills, which, let's be honest, the only reason most would even give a film like this a chance, to begin with.Save the money you'd spend on this and the time you would waste and check out some real classic 'B' film!"
2,For the CGI Seafood lover in you,"This wasn't great, but it wasnt poor either. I really did not like the CGI effects in this. I thought that that Octopus was really the best part of the movie but it wasnt on screen long enough.Characters were bland which is par for the course of made for DVD or TV movies. No blood, gore , nudity, vomit , etc which to me is a rare treat. Its about the monsters but alas the fight between the 2 monsters doesn't occur until the very end. Mostly this had more of the Mega Shark in it.Simply story, you've seen it before - a huge iceberg breaks releasing 2 prehistoric creatures that are 'unstoppable' ..they obviously hadnt watched superior movies on how to stop giant Sharks and OctopiWorth renting because it was kind of entertaining if nothing else...Deborah Gibson and Lorenzo Lamas are pretty much wasted here..But I did like the Giant Octopus for the little time it was on screen :) 2 stars for that !"
3,Blatantly terrible,"I figured this would be a regular b movie ,maybe decent,maybe awful but it's something entirely different. It looks like they pulled out all the stops to make it purposely bad .The monsters do ridiculously outlandish things,the characters are totally nonsensical,the plot very silly,the effects laughable ....the whole ball of wax.At times i just sat there smiling thinking 'wtf'.They should have made it in 3d and that would've completed the farce.;-)Anyways,for just that reason it's worth watching.It's like Airplane without the jokes."
1,The worst movie you've ever seen?,"I always laugh about those who make a review about the worst movie they've ever seen. Now, it happened to me. Really the worst! Deborah, i love you, and you are great, but this movie is truly awful."
1,This is a grade D movie,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend who is a serious Debbie Gibson fan - teenage crush kind of thing. He loved it (OK, he loved Debbie Gibson) but this has to be one of the worst movies I have had to endure! The only one worse than this was Clash of the Titans. My boyfriend specifically requested this movie for his birthday, otherwise I never would have wasted my money. If you just have to see this piece of trash, rent it (if you can) or buy it used (unless you are stuck, like me, with buying it as a gift - too tacky to give some one a used DVD as a gift)."
1,It's like being Lobotomized!,"This movie has about as much imagination and creativity as the title!My brain took a REAL BEATING watching this one! I really could not believe my eyes.This film contains the worst acting in the history of cinema! It is typical TRASH from Asylum. They had such a great opportunity to make a fun giant monster movie and they blew it! They should take all the original negatives from this film, burn them, then bury the ashes in an undisclosed location, put the director in a Turkish prison, then make all the actors pay restitution to an oceanographic institution of their choice. This disc would make a better use as a urinal cake!!This TRULY is one of the worst films I have ever seen. You have been warned!!!"
3,A little disappointed...,"...and here's why:When I saw the previews I was pretty excited. Here was a 21st century production that reminded me of childhood Saturday's watching old Godzilla movies. I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. When it arrived I got the kids together and put it on. Now, don't get me wrong. So much of this film is exactly what I expected. Silly, exciting, entertaining. What I didn't like was the moments of course language and the sex scene. Totally not needed in this kind of movie that should really be a true ""G"" rated film in order to rate up there with the most popular ""B"" movies of the 50's and 60's. If not for that, I would've easily given it 5 stars for pure ""FUN""!"
1,worst movie ever...,"You have to see to believe how bad this movie is, not to mention the acting and directing....makes ed wood look like coppola"
3,WHAT HAPPENED?,This was supposed to be released on MAY 19TH. Now it has a sign up to be notified when it'd released tag on it.
2,Poor performance from a choir that used to be the best.,Gone is the sound of Willcocks. The new sound is strident and cold. I've tried buying a few recent King's College recordings and they are harsh sounding. I can't tell if it's the choir or the recording technique. Much better to try and find Willcock's performance on record of the Chichester Psalms - much better than this one.
4,What!?!? How did I miss this one?,"1993 I was heavily into Hip Hop and copped most all tapes that came out. This one I dont remember even hearing about. I picked this up used last month and its definately one of those hidden gems. Only a handful of tracks but most are produced by Pete Rock and all have that raw 1993 New York street edge to it. I wonder if they are still active? If not, wasted talent..."
4,NICE '93 STUFF,"dis EP is very nice, 6 tracks produced by pete rock, vance wright & willy gunz..jazzy vibes, tight beats, and street life lyrics..if you like that new school underrated material, check this out."
3,Forgotten Pete Rock ish...,"Dollar bin dust collectors skipped over by crate diggers are a dime a dozen. Yet, the quest to find lost treasure never ends. We all passed on that Yaggfu Front album the first twenty times, right? Well, take a look at the producers on this EP. Short list...except for two tracks it's all Pete Rock. These guys are pretty average grimey New York heads with a few nice lines, but Pete laces them lovely in his standard '91-94 style. The title track alone, with it's ""Do or Die"" chorus, is worth the penny it costs to cop it. On ""Wonders in Da Bed"", the YG'z gutter sex rhymes benefit from Vance Wright's dancehall groove. Sounds much like his work with cuz Slick Rick on ""The Ruler's Back"". Can't beat the price, guys, so don't hesitate."
1,"Won't take or hold a charge, completely useless","A couple of the reviews here made me hopeful that this might work, even though it was so cheap. I guess there's a reason why real Canon parts are so much more expensive: my actual Canon batteries work incredibly well and the charge lasts for eons. Even after three consecutive overnight charges, this one is so weak that my camera will barely turn on, and if it does, it won't power the LCD display, even. (I managed to take 2 pictures before it crapped out, but of course I couldn't even see what I was snapping, since the LCD wouldn't come on) Given the price, it might not be worth the shipping to send it back, I might just have to find somewhere local that can recycle it..."
3,Meh...,"At $1.13, it's not exactly the one Bill Gates would have chosen. But it's also not what they use in the Mars Rover either! ... But for the money, it's OK.So far, I've charged it one time. It received and retained the charge. (4.24 volts) I have read that the potential (or retained power) gets stronger after a few charges.I have another NB-3L battery that 'says' 1500 mAh (though I know it's not), that outlasted this one twice. But it did last long enough to take 50 pictures in a Canon PowerShot SD550 that has power consumption issues, so this is GOOD!I think it's OK for a 'backup'."
1,"Does not work, needs to send for replacement","Battery did not work, had no power, had to return it for a replacement and have not received a replacement yet. Hope they make right. Unsure as of now."
1,"Sent correct battery, but wrong charger",They sent the correct camera battery but they sent the wrong charger. I still have not received the correct replacement and it has been several weeks. Clearly they didn't check what they were sending out.
3,Feel Cheated,"Have been using maglites for years and trust them but this time I have been kinda cheated. The light is still as good as ever (hence the 3 stars) but experienced 2 things:1. Bought the product and lo behold, a week later the price was down 30%. At the local Walmart, this was selling at half the price I bought it! Now this was the cheapest listing at the time of placing the order and maybe I was dumb enough to believe that it was the best deal around.2. The pocket clip just doesn't fit - it is too small. Now I don't want to go through the whole grind of returning the item just because of the clip and end up spending even more. Wouldn't have THAT issue at any local store.Learnt my lesson. Will try to skip amazon for smaller cheaper products. Even with higher prices, something like an Office Depot or a Radioshack makes more sense."
3,Nice but unnecessary,"Sure, it's very convenient to have the lotion right inside the razor, but it can get expensive to constantly have to buy more of these packs. I use regular shaving gel with my Cool Skin shaver and have never had a problem in the two years I have used it. I still use the packs when traveling, just for the space savings."
5,Norelco Cartridges,"It does everything it should do; unfortunately, doesn't seem to be available at WalMart any longer, so we were pleased to find it at Amazon."
3,"Works alright, but gel is better","These are replacement cartridges for the Norelco Cool Skin shaver. The lotion does not work as well as the gel(in my opinion), but is still ok."
5,A story of lives drawn to conflict in the Congo,"Ronan Bennett's ""Catastrophist"" grips you from the outset. Who are these characters stranded on the banks of the Sankuru river in December 1960 and what is their involvement in the life and arrest of Patrice Lamumba? Why is this ""a story of failure""? Bennett sucks you into the lives of the main protagonists in a style that is crisp and direct. Gillespie's cynicism and and resignation is set in contrast to the idealism and dynamism of Inez. Both are flawed. And the Belgian Congo is flawed. I never felt I was being given a treatise on the political history of the Congo but ended up being as intrigued by the story of its conflict as by the the fate of Bennett's characters. He has managed a considerable achievement in marrying a story of deep personal sensitivity and searching with one of the Congo's despairing lurch for normal life. And maybe it's about all our lives. This is a great book."
4,Fine historical page-turner,"Bennett's American debut is fascinating for its historical context (that being what drew me to the novel in the first place), and also for the richness of its characters and plot. The Belgian Congo is vividly portrayed, and stocked with a wide range of characters -- from Gillespie and Ines to Stipe, de Scheut and Auguste -- who ""stay with you"" long after you've finished the book. Bennett's concern with the role of writers in political causes is very interesting, particularly within the context of his own experiences as a Belfast youth and, subsequently, a London journalist. Plot-wise, he succeeds in cranking up the suspense so that, by the final chapters, you'll find it hard to put the book down. Overall, ""The Catastrophist"" is an ambitious novel which will leave the reader satisfied."
2,Great review - lousy math,"Nice review of basic math principles, but there are an incredible number of mistakes in the answer section in the back of the book. Really confusing."
5,Great book for people with math phobia,"As a former university-level math teacher, I have used this book multiple times to help adult students get over math phobia. It presents basic concepts in an organized, simple way. Learning math only makes sense when taken on as a series of logical, sequential steps. If you find yourself struggling with using everyday math, there's a good chance you missed one of those steps during elementary or jr. high school. If that's the case, this book is for you. It fills in the blanks that you might not even know you have. Math really can be made simple, and this book shows how. It's an oldie but goodie."
1,BEWARE!,"I purchased this Oratorio after hearing a violin solo from it, and was expecting something similar of the rest. I was sorely disappointed. Unfortunately, I got this item somewhere else, to my Eternal grief (at least on AMAZON, I would have saved $25.00). All the soloists do as best they can with the material given (especially the violin solo in Movement VI), but the lyrics could have been written by a fifth-grader with a Rhyming Dictionary. Here is an example of great talent gone to waste. BE FOREWARNED: just because Paul McCartney's name is attached to this vanity work of supposedly ""serious"" music, does NOT make this a good piece of music. Carl Davis has written many wonderful scores for movies, and Paul McCartney can stand on his own past record of good works, but this is so trite, silly, and appallingly bad that I wish I was able to give it minus five stars. Beware!"
3,"Ok stuff, Not bad but nothing special","This is ok stuff. Very soothing and easy going stuff, may be an initiation for those new to choral works. The music is too simple, you can make out it's by Paul. The complete school section is good. Basically it has some 5 sections, each depicting a period of pauls life. It feels more like paul wrote a few pop ballads and then he extended it for an oratoria. Not bad, but you dont need to include it in you collection, unless you want very much to see what Paul sounds like in the classical vein"
3,ok,"Nothing in this really soars. The piece should actually be called ""Paul McCartney's and Carl Davis' Liverpool Oratorio"" since Carl Davis had as much to do with it as McCartney did. And Davis complained as such, but said ""McCartney's ego"" made the piece just his in the title. It makes commercial sense, but was bad manners. And I heard a d.j. on a classical radio station say that the CD should have been called ""Paul McCartney's Liverpool Oratorio Banalate,"" and he has a point. It's a bland piece in a lot of spots. But there are some good moments, too."
2,Too Soft,This gets boring after 10 listens. Twistas album Adrenaline rush has songs that have better lyrics...
2,Not for everyone,"Be careful before buying this recording and listen to it somewhere before you buy it. I did not do it and trusted the reviews above and now I have recording I will hardly listen to it again. Everything is nice and cast is well chosen with one exception. Delilah`s role is essentuial for the opera and Miss Meier is among the weakest mezzo I have ever heard. I can not understand the others reviewer`s delight, but I could not find anything interesting in her voice. It is dull, weak voice with no lower register /in mezzosoprano!/ and in emotive scenes she has no power. Well, the most famous aria ""Mon coeur s'ouvre a ta voix"" is sung O.K. /but not among the best versions/, but the opera has much more to offer in Delilah`h secenes a there I was really dissatisfied with the weakness and not a mezzo voice colour of her voice."
2,Product not quite as I expected it to be,"I purchased this travel system last fall for my first child. The first time I used the stroller, one of the wheels had a terrible vibration and when my newborn was in her infant seat, locked into the stroller, her head would bounce with every push. I took it back and exchanged it for another. I got along fine with the stroller and really like it. We now have issues with the car seat. We recently adjusted the base so our baby could be a little more upright. Since we did that, we noticed the seat bobbing and wobbling as we drive. I've had the base installed by a car seat technician in 3 different vehicles and have had the same result every time. I have purchased another travel system from a different manufacturer and will be returning this one for a full refund. I really feel the car seat base needs to be modified somehow to help stabilize the car seat. It's like the car seat is too top-heavy for the base."
1,Car seat not good,"We received this travel system as a gift from our registry. My husband was having trouble getting the base for the car seat to fit tightly in the car so we took it to a professional at the fire department. The lady there told my husband that this car seat has a design flaw that does not allow it to be used in all cars. The bottom fits tightly, but the top of the car seat moves all over and could easily tip over when turning a corner. The lady suggested that we use the car seat without the base, but that does not seem safe to me. I called Eddie Bauer and they do not have a recall on the item. Babies R Us agreed to take it back in exchange for a different travel system as long as we could get the receipt since we threw the box away already. Although I have not used the stroller yet, I do think that it's a great stroller, but the car seat is just not safe in our cars (Ford Contour 2000 and Ford Escape 2004). Unless you know for sure that it will work in your car, I would not buy it."
2,Unstable carseat,"I purchased this travel system over the weekend. My husband and I had no problem with the stroller. However, once we installed the carseat into our car, we noticed how very unstable the carseat actually was. The entire front of the carseat easily moved from side to side. I expected this carseat to not be able to move at all once placed into position in my car. For the amount of money that we paid, I would have thought this product would be top of the line and very stable. Boy was I wrong."
3,Not impressed for such a pricey travel system,"I received this travel system as a gift, after having registered for a different one, mainly because this one is so much cuter. I went to the store and had a difficult time figuring out how to install the car seat into the stroller. After a salesperson showed me how to do it, it still wobbled a lot, it locks in place on the foot of the infant seat, instead of the middle or the front, so it's not stable at all. Also, this travel system is bulkier and heavier than other models. I ended up with the Graco Metrolite system, while not cute, is super easy to work with, very secure, and much lighter than other systems."
1,TOO HARD,I HAD PURCHASED THIS TRAVEL SYSTEM FOR THE NAME EDDIE BAUER WHICH WAS A BIG MISTAKE CAUSE IT WAS HARDER THAN IT IS WORTH THE CARSEAT IS TOO HEAVY AND TOO BIG AND THE STROLLER DOESN'T OPEN WITH ONE HAND. THE CARSEAT IS TOO HARD TO HOOK IN THE STROLLER I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS STROLLER TO ANYONE. IT TOOK ME 20 MINUTES TO OPEN AND HOOK UP.
2,Buyer Beware...Try it out before buying!!!!,"We purchased this travel system because we liked how sturdy it seemed. My husband thinks the car seat/carrier is too heavy, but to me that makes it seem sturdier. I LOVE the stroller. It is extremely easy to maneuver, and very user-friendly! We had absolutely no trouble when our son was small, but now, the car seat will tip over when you go around a corner. No matter which way we install this seat (seat belt or tether straps), we cannot get it tight enough. I think it must be our car (we have a montero), because not everyone has this trouble. I highly recommend that you try it in your car before you purchase this. As any parent would agree, the safety of your child is most important!!!!!"
3,CD looks like a duplicate.,"CD looks like a duplicate / copy in a cardboard case and no info. CD is white with black letters and no manufacture, only artist name and name of album. Sound quality is good.""Beware"""
4,Uneven,"This is a rip-roaring naval adventure from start to finish, no mistake. But I also find it one of the most problematic in the Hornblower series. For one thing, the action seems much more episodic (and, as a result, much more easily resolved) than in previous installments. But the big concern is that Hornblower is perhaps at his most unlikable in this book. His deeply flawed character has always been one of his most intriguing aspects. But here, he crosses the line into self-absorbed whining, IMO. He doesn't feel as developed as he does in the earlier books, no doubt because this one was written second. Forester seems to have gotten to know his character better as he went, which lends an interesting, but still unfortunate, sense of unevenness to this otherwise enjoyable book."
2,No digital copy for sale at Amazon,"I find it deplorable that this well-recieved series still has no digital KINDLE copy for selected titles (Happy Return,Ship of the Line). Other titles in long-running series suffer the same fate.Amazon has made it difficult to like them, and it is getting more and more unlikely they will ever change their ways. BTW, how many requests does it take to have Amazon find it profitable enough to make a KINDLE copy of a publication available?Sounded like a good book, as I have read the synopsis elsewhere. Unfortuantely I just now bought the printed version at a used book store in the city."
4,Hornblower continues to hold my interest,"This is the seventh book in the series that I have read. Even though this is the 2nd book written, it is the 7th in the chronology of Hornblower's life. This is the first book that is a cliffhanger, so I have obtained the next book and have begun reading it already.I really like the technical detail that Forester puts into these novels. I have learned a lot about sailing and really appreciate the great skill it took for men to sail these warships. As an engineer, everything he explains makes sense and helps me appreciate these novels.Hornblower's character continues to fascinate me. His strengths and weaknesses are a combination that makes one root for him.I highly recommend this book and I will continue to read the rest of the series."
3,It's ok,"I mainly bought this for my laptop but since it does not fit, there is no use for it. I'm disappointed how the zipper does not extend out as much. I do agree with the others, the material looks really really cheap and flimsy and that it's not worth $200s unless you just want the brand only."
4,Decent for the price,"There are better messenger-style bags, but the Prada is pretty good. Mine came with a few loose threads, but otherwise was finely made. I won't buy another one, but I'm not disappointed with it."
1,Great Ideas!,"Great ideas although the one project I wanted to do which was the beveled glass ornaments looked simple enough but, no matter what craft store I went to you couldn't find beveled glass. I really was looking forward to making those ornaments for Christmas gifts. I may just stick with the candles."
3,"OK, not the best","THis wasnt great. It was cool, and fun, b ut didnt work how i wanted and was not the right size. Case was very cheap, but other items were nice. Yep, thats all"
2,Broken within minutes... but my daughter loves the mike...,"The microphone stand broke literally the first time my daughter touched it. She tried to move the mike to sing into it and it snapped off. She loves the toy, especially the mike. I haven't tried to return it or see what can be done yet. Not looking forward to that process based on the reviews I've read here..."
1,Very unfortunate purchase,"I'm glad to see that my children aren't bad destructive kids, as it looks like our keyboard was not the only one broken by the end of christmas day. I bought it for my almost three year old son and he was soooo excited to play it - he sat right down and played and sang. The older kids got ahold of it. The stand doesn't stay together, the microphone stand and connector to the keyboard broke. The seat is okay, and they keyboard itself is working standalone. I'm going to see, since there are so many bad reviews, if i can take it back - fortunately I kept the boxes and receipts!I normally give musical instruments a high educational value, but since this one is so bad, I only gave it a 1. I see that they don't carry this anymore...The older kids built a steeplechase in the kitchen and used the keyboard parts as jumps, so I guess it provided some fun!"
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this keyboard for my 3 1/2 yr old for Christmas. She loved it. She played with the keyboard and loved the music..of course after 5 minutes, she went to use the microphone and it broke off. The manufacturer should really rething the construction of that microphone, it is so flimsy and the piece that broke off was sharp. I boxed the keyboard up and returned it to Toys R Us the next day....They were out of stock so I couldn't get another one...but after reading all the reviews, I'm glad they didn't have any....I'm going to look for something that will last more than 5 minutes."
2,Do not buy this toy!,I bought this toy for my two year old twins and it broke within one day. The microphone broke so we glued it and then the stand broke. The idea for the toy was great but it just needs to be made a lot stronger.
2,Listen to the Reviews!!!,"I bought this thinking that the reviews would be wrong, but much to my disappointment the speaker stand broke on mine as well. The toy itself is great, has great sound, keyboard is fun, lights up ETC, but horrible construction.The plastic is cheaply made, and even when properly put together it is wobbly. My son loved it (we had it for 2 days!!) and I just wish that they would have put more time/money/energy into childproofing this product.Overall good idea, bad construction."
3,Not the best,"We bought this particular keyboard because we trusted in the Little Tykes name. However, it definitely does not have the durability of other toys made by Little Tykes. It's fun though. My 3 year old loves to sit on the little stool, and she enjoys playing on the piano while the demo songs are being played. The microphone is also fun, but the sound isn't clear, and sometimes it causes a high pitched feedback noise. Most of the demo songs are not recognizable. The owner's manual lists the songs names, such as ""Les Premers De Vanessa Souriries"" and ""Happy Chinese year."" The song that I do recognize is ""Music Box Dancer."" My other complaint is that when you turn it off and then turn it back on again, the volume always resets to a loud volume. Too loud for me! I still recommend it as a fun toy, but it's definitely not as durable or as high in quality are other Little Tykes products."
2,ANOTHER UNSATIFIED CUSTOMER,"I understand the idea of only spending $30 on this item but I found several features to be unsatifactory. For one when you turn the piano on it automatically starts at the highest decibal, second the microphone gives off a loud sceech if it is near the keys and I have a tall 3 1/2 year old and there was no adjusting it for it not to screech at his height. Last the microphone was poorly constructed. Ours as well broke within hours of putting it together. I'm very disappointed because it seemed like it could've been a lot of fun."
3,They just don't make toys the way they use to!!!!!!,"My son received this piano for his 3rd birthday. I also have a one year old son. They both absolutely love the piano but I am not happy at all with the quality. The microphone stand will not stay in place, it is constantly coming out. The plastic it is made out of is extremely flimsy. We are only on day three and I am sure it will be broken before we reach a week! They really need to improve the quality of this product!"
1,Falls apart,Like others said the microphone stand broke very easily and the whole toy is not durable at all. The legs and the stool do not stay together whatsoever. My son has to sit with it on his lap to play it. I would not recommend this toy to anyone.
1,Another Warning!!,"Do not buy this toy. At any discount. Period.No company should ever see a dime for such a shoddy product.Like most other ""complainers"", my 2 1/2 year old broke the mic stand within a half-hour after assembly. The microphone emits almost constant feedback which isn't helped by positioning alone, might be electrical problems on top of audio feedback.It's a shame really. My daughter is so excited at the idea of a ""piano for her size"". It was her favorite toy this christmas.I think anyone else who has had bad experiences should contact Little Tikes. The real maker of this toy, Kid Station, somehow hoodwinked Little Tikes to distribute this thing. Normally, Little Tikes toys are built solidly and we bought on this reputation. It takes many toys to build parental trust...it only takes one to ruin it completely. I'm much more leery to buy a Little Tikes product now...Stay away from this item."
2,problems with microphone,Obviously the reason this item was such a good price is because of it's poor quality. A child small enough to use it can't sit close enough to the microphone without it making a horrible squealing noise. Essentially if the microphone gets anywhere near the keyboard itself it makes an awful (unbearable)noise. Don't bother spending the money on this one...you're better off spending a few extra dollars to get one that's not so annoying.
3,Little Tikes,The idea was good but the product is poorly built. My daughter had no sooner touched her microphone then the piece holding it on the stand fell off. And continues to fall off. My husband is going to have to glue it into place. This keyboard stand and seat should have been made of heavier plastic. The slightest wrong movement sends it crashing to the floor which I then have to reassemble because the keyboard and stand do not fit tightly together.The keyboard is fun though. The different sounds and melodies entertain my daughter who loves to make up her own songs as she plays.I feel disappointed in my purchase though because I had expected better quality from a toy with the little tikes name attached. The toy should be rebuilt with heavier plastic so that it can stand up to some rock n rollin not just petite classical interludes.
3,Broke before his birthday could even end!,"The idea of the toy is awesome. My two year old son had a great time with it during the first few hours he played with it. It is very light, so it was knocked over and the plastic peice that holds the mic in place snapped in two. The key board still plays wonderfully and he loves to play with it still, but there is now a hole where the mic holder used to be, and the mic is now found a new resting place on the floor."
4,MY TWO YEAR OLD LOVES IT,"he received this for Christmas and just loves it. He can turn it on, play it, and use the microphone all by himself. he loves pushing all the keys and buttons and hearing all the neat sounds as well as seeing the various lights that light up.The item does tend to tip over somewhat easily so you do have to be careful. also the Stool doesn't seem overly sturdy by my son stands up anyway when he plays it. So far I haven't had any of the other problems that other reviewers have mentioned.But I agree with the person that said you get what you pay for. You can't expect the highest quality toy of this kind for a mere $30 or so. good for what it is and quite fun."
4,good for the money,"My mil just bought this for my 15 mos old daughter because she loved playing with the display in the store. A lot of the posters were complaining about it not being durable, but you get what you pay for. You are not going to get a great big sturdy keyboard for $30. If you want something more durable you are going to have to pay more. I think that it's really great. Even though the age range is 3+, my daughter will sit at it and play and sing for a long time. It holds her attention well. Since she is so little, we had to put a higher chair for her to sit at though. I reccomend this toy if you are looking for something economical."
1,Breaks Easy - Don't Buy It,"Like most others here the microphone broke off on the first day when my son and a 3 year old were playing with it. On the second day, the speaker cuts in and out and it won't play songs anymore. He had fun with it for about 4 hours. A total piece of junk. Look at other keyboards. We bought this because it seems to be the only one with its own stand."
2,Toys great in a padded room as long as you don;t touch it,I see we all have this in common. Ordered from Amazon and immediately the stool was missing. Put it together easily. On day two my five year old snapped microphone stand. Around day six my three year old collasped it and I can't get it back together. And then the microphone pulled out around day nine. The bill came around day fifteen.
3,"Agree...Not very well made, but fun for my daughter","We got this last Christmas. The microphone broke off the first day. Tried to fix it, but it didn't take. Never got around to seeing about getting it replaced. Our daughter still plays with it a lot though. I just had to replace the batteries in it a couple of weeks ago...and then the microphone stopped working alltogether sometime after that.I was getting ready to order the drumset this company makes, too, and then saw that it was made by the same people that made this and decided against buying it."
1,THIS TOY SUCKS!!!!!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Like so many of the reviews written I have the same problem. THe mic piece broke right away and trying to get a replacement was a NIGHTMARE!!! Kid Station was very unhelpful and rude. Customer service/ non-support did not care either way if the product was returned or not. I actually called little tikes to complain about them. The Key board itself is cheap, plastic is flimsy, the stool is not sturdy the music is way to load, and the mic holder broke right away! biggest waste of $30. The only reson why i rated this toy a 1 star was b/c there was no way to rate this a BIG FAT ZERO star!! save yourself the hassle and do not buy this toy! buy anthing else but this!!!!!!!"
1,Toys Falls Apart All The Time,This toy would be great if it would stay together and not fall apart everytime my kids play with it. We have two of these!! The microphones broke within a month of getting them. I would NOT recommend buying this toy.
1,Cheap and Unsafe,"I feel the need to write a review for this item. Not only did my microphone stand break off but the stool keeps falling apart. This is not just a cheap toy, it is UNSAFE! My daughter could easily be seriously hurt by hitting her head on something any one of the countless times the stool has fallen apart. I wish I could give this toy less than one star."
2,3 out of 3 broken!,"My daughter (age 2), and 2 nieces (ages 1 and 3) each received one of these toys for Christmas. All three of these toys broke within 5 minutes of being taken out of the box in exactly the same spot~ The arm that holds the microphone onto the keyboard snapped at the base. I think this was poor craftmanship for a child's toy. It shouldn't be so fragile."
2,Little Tykes shouldnt have put their name on this,"Very chinzy and cheap pieces. i had to glue pieces together to keep them from falling apart. also, the battery door has a teeny tiny screw thats virtually impossible to screw and unscrew for battery replacement. YOu almost end up stripping the head of the screw trying to do it. the keyboard is the only part thats half way decent."
3,Cheap but Enjoyed by Kids,"We got this for our daughter's 3rd birthday. The microphone stand broke about a week after she got it. I velcroed it to the piano so it is at least not dangling on the floor. The stand is a little rickety and comes apart easily. The piano part has held up well and still works great 1 year later. My 11 month old loves to play with it and push all of the buttons. I got it on sale, but would not have paid full price for this toy. It is cheaply made, but my kids love it anyway! I wish the piano could be separated from the stand, then I would just throw the stand away."
1,"Cheap plastic, doesn't live up to Tikes reputation","I don't think this toy could have been made any cheaper. Ours is cracked in several places, even though it's hardly been played with... My kids really are not hard on toys, and are destroying this one. We also had bought the drumset from Little Tikes, but returned it, because it broke before I could even assemble it. Disappointing. This keyboard just doesn't live up to my expectations from Little Tikes products."
3,Little Tykes Keyboard,"Keyboard and stool were quick to assemble and easy for the child to play. The way that the lights react to the tone of the music is a nice feature. My child is 2 1/2. Less satisfying is the performance of the microphone boom. It is less sturdy than the rest of the toy. The grooves to keep the knob in place wore out within a few adjustments. And slight movements, such as playing the keys can knock it out of position. As a result, microphone placement and adjustments are frustrating and/or require assistance for a younger child. I have considered applying duct tape to keep it in place."
1,Never even got to use it,"We bought this for our son in August as a Christmas gift. We put it away until then. On Christmas morning, our son was so excited when he opened it. When I was putting it together he couldn't wait to play with it. I got it all together and turned it on only to find it had no power at all. Tried many brand new batteries but nothing. The look on my son's face made my heart sink. He was so upset. We called Kid Station and asked them what we could do about it. They said the warrenty had already expired. They told us we could ship it to them and they would sell us another one for a discounted price. So, we would have to pay for the shipping of this one and pay for another one including shipping. It's not even worth it. So, my advice is to not buy this product. If you do, make sure it works as soon as you buy it."
3,keyboard and microphone,"The Little Tikes piano is one of my son's favorite toys. He loves making music and singing into the microphone! The microphone does squeal loudly when his mouth gets too close to it, which sometimes upsets him (and us), and occasionally squeals on its own."
2,Fun toy but not durable AT ALL.,"We got this toy for my 3 year old son. He loved it! The lights are cool and the different tempos and stuff it has is cool. But like most of these reviews the microphone stand broke after only a few days of using it. I also called customer service and was told to send a request in writing. I could barely understand the guy I talked to and he was pretty short with me, wouldn't even let me make sure I had written down the address correctly. The rest of the toy has held up good but my son loves the microphone and that is why we got this particular one. My son isn't even rough with it and it just broke. I wouldn't waste your money on this. It isn't worth it. And I don't agree with the person who said you get what you pay for. This SHOULD be better constructed considering that Little Tikes has their name on it."
2,The quality if horrible,"My daughter received this as a Christmas present, and by 3:00 that afternoon, the joint on the microphone holder broke. I was very dissapointed. You would think that the manufacturer would have enough inteligence to realize that kids toys need to be durable! I'm not really sure what they were thinking...or if they even were. I would not reccomend this keyboard to anyone."
2,The stand fell apart instantly,"This is fun and a good idea, but the quality of the stand and the plastic is very poor. It fell apart the first time we had it up, and while you can put it back together, unless you want to be doing it every ten seconds, it isn't worth it. The keyboard itself is fine. The microphone overpowers the keyboard music and has no volume on it, but the keyboard does. The microphone stand is really cheap plastic and broke right away. I would suggest buying a cheap keyboard and microphone and just using it on a table instead, or if you buy this product, don't expect to use the keyboard stand for long, but it can work without it."
1,Not a very good product,"My son (3) loves the toy but it is not safe, breaks real easy and half of the buttons do not work. Its a shame because my sons loves music. I just wished they would have made a better product."
2,Poor Quality,"My son received this for his 3rd birthday and the microphone broke off within a week. I called customer service and was told I needed to contact the outside distributor who manufactured the toy. Once I called them, I received the worst customer service and was told I needed to write a letter to the warehouse requesting a new part. I was told that I would have to pay for the part and that it was not even certain that they would have the part in stock. For as much fun as a keyboard is for my son, I would not recommend this particular model. It is truly not worth the hassle."
3,better suited for smaller kids......,"my three year old loved playing with it. it definitely had the fun factor for him, but it was too small. my son is average size for his age but the stool was a bit too small and uncomfortable. we ended up returning it for that reason."
1,Not worth the money,"We have had this piano for a few months before it just stopped working. My girls are not very hard on toys. So, when it tipped over on very soft carpet and stopped working I realized it was a piece of junk. The microphone attachement also snapped off when my 3 year old rotated it. We originally had another piano in mind to purchase but Toys R Us was out of it and the sales person recommended this one since all the other parents were buying it. We decided to buy it since most Little Tikes products are great. This one certainly is not."
2,Not worth the money,"This piano looks adorable. Unfortunately, the microphone attachment broke within the first week. Also, the legs of the piano constantly come apart. Perhaps you could try superglue, but I don't think that would work for very long either. It is certainly not as durable as most other Little Tykes products. I recommend you continue to look at other options. My children never play with this and it was a waste of money. Poor quality; Poor sound; Doesn't function that well. Very frustrating. Another item for the garbage!"
2,CHEAP but fun while it lasted,"This toy was a lot of fun for my kids and my nephews while it lasted. The microphone broke off then one day it just stopped working! I changed the batteries but NADA! What a piece of trash now! But we had fun with it while it lasted...which wasn't long!***FYI--I emailed the company and they sent me a new one...the microphone and stand quickly broke, but it is still working. Be very gentle with the stand if you purchase this toy!"
3,"Child Loved It, but It Didn't Last","Our 2 year old loved this keyboard. He liked the microphone feature also. He played ""music"" every day, which maybe is why his keyboard is broken already. I am pretty handy, so I took it apart to see if a wire came loose, but ther was no sign of that... it just stopped working one day. He misses it. We were looking for another keyboard that comes with a stand, but we haven't found one. I guess we will have to buy this one again. Maybe the next one will last longer. I will keep my receipt just in case."
2,Thank God we still have the box so we can return it!!!,"My son received this keyboard for a gift. He also received another one that is one of those Wal-Mart, Kid's Connection, cost effective/cheap products. Wellll, within two hours of having it assembled, like most everyone else here said, he'd broken the microphone stand. He wasn't being rough, just adjusting it!! The cheap keyboard has entertained him just as much and is more durable. Shame on Little Tikes!! I've always been such a fan because of the quality of the product. I figure if the microphone broke that quick, the legs won't last long either, so it's going back! Also, once assembled, you can't disassemble without breaking the plastic on the legs. BOOO! Worst gift of the year award!!!"
3,Great toy - but poor quality reduces enjoyment,"MY child loved this toy Santa brought even though we had some explaining to do since the microphone stand broke on Christmas day. I noticed the poor quality as I put it together, but I did not expect it to break so easily. Also, if you have any kids below 3, keep them away from it because it tips and falls over very easily. Finally, the volume always reverts to loudest as soon as it is turned on. But for the quality issues, this would be a winner - lots of features for a toddler."
2,"Fun toy, poor quality","My husband and I bought this for my son, age 2, for Christmas. He really likes it. It is a great toy for him and has many features. I do agree with a lot of other reviews about the quality of this toy. It stinks! My son has already broken the microphone stand. It is made of very cheap plastic, not sturdy at all. Not something that I would expect from little tikes either. I don't care if it was 30 bucks or not, it should withstand childsplay... its a toy!! Great product, poorly made. Little Tikes should consider choosing another company to make this product. Overall I don't regret purchasing this because my son enjoys it, I just would have assembled the microphone differently so it wouldn't have broken so quickly. There is other keyboards out there, and I would consider shopping around because they are similar and all offer about the same amount of features, but maybe better quality."
2,Fun while it lasted.....which wasn't long,"My goddaughter received this for her 2nd birthday and while the kids enjoyed it immensely, within 24 hours the microphone was broken. This should have been a sign, but it didn't deter us from buying one for my daughter (3 years old) since she enjoyed it so much. We were extra careful with it but while the microphone didn't break off, the entire unit has stopped working. Initially we thought it just needed new batteries, but once we replaced them the thing just died. What a shame. It was a blast when it worked even though it was poorly constructed and quite flimsy. But now that it doesn't work at all, I'd have to say it's a piece of crap. Sorry."
2,disappointed,"Christmas gift for my kids. Had seen them playing a similar toy (different maker) at their friends house. When shopping saw this one, and hoping the Little Tykes reputation would give me a better product, I bought this one instead of the other brand. Boy was I wrong! The second day the microphone arm broke. a month or so later, one of the bubble shaped light caved in. My kids weren't being too rough with the toy, they were just playing like kids would. I am disappointed that the quality is not up to what I usually expect from Little Tykes. If the pieces weren't broken, my kids would still be playing with it. But, they don't like it the way it is."
2,"My children love it , but it is not sturdy enough for 3 yr olds!","As with a couple of the other reviewers, my kids 2, 3 and 8 yrs. old all loved it. I expected it to be much sturdier because of the Little Tikes brand, but was sadly mistaken. The keyboard and microphone stands both broke almost immediately, but we kept using it because the kids enjoyed it. It was also a grandma gift, so I didn't want to return it. I was very disappointed in this product."
1,Almost Broke out of the Box Ditto!,This item was purchsed for my sons 3rd b-day and it broke the next day. The plastic that it is made from is so cheap and flemsy. I did not expect it to be so having the Little Tikes name but apparently they did not manufactor it. I fell somewhat decived by this. I thought I was buying a product with the little tikes quality I have come to expect. It was a complete rip off. Pleae do not waste your money!
3,"Poor quality, but great idea","My mother bought this toy for my son's 2nd birthday and he absolutely loved it, however it is a very poor quality toy. The screw that holds the battery in place is very tiny and was already stripped out of the box. The microphone stand broke and overall the entire thing is constructed from a very cheap plastic. I was very surprised that Little Tikes put their name on this one. The idea is great!, but the durabilty and quality is very poor. The keyboard however, is very good and the idea of a stand and chair is great as well. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,BROKEN!,I have to agree with others on this one. The microphone broke off leaving 2 sharp peices of plastic! We returned this! Thank goodness the garbage truck hadnt come yet to pick up the box! Don't buy this!
1,Not what you need.,"If you are looking for a marine repair manual you probably have some mechanical skill but not so much you want to completely rebuild right down to the crankshaft. This book does the exact opposite. Wasted pages on the basics of four cylce combustion (who is there that would not already know but still care?), chapters on using micometers on everything from pistons to bearings (something usually only done in rebuild shops). But there is very little information the average boat owner can use. Little or incorrect information on replacing risers, pumps or stern drive removal.The Seloc manual is a much better choice although it has many of the same sins, just less so. The Seloc also has much more complete tune up information. The factory manuals have better illustrations than either manual but are harder to find."
2,died fast,"I got this drive with other components as I put together my home PC. The drive worked great for ~6 months and then it just died. I could not burn anything but coasters, although it can read anything you put in it.After trying all kind of suggestions, even opening up the drive and do an internal cleaning and lubricating of the mechanisms, it was a no go, so I just got another drive (different brand) from a local store. Maybe I got a bad unit."
4,Good value for the money,The only thing keeping me from giving this five stars is that it is noisy. I will trade a little noise for the speed any day. Compared to the old IDE drive I replaced this DVDRW screams. Make sure you have the SATA cables and a power converter if your motherboard does not have SATA power because it does not come with them.
4,China Seas,"Harlow, Gable, and Beery teamed up again. Wally Beery played a mean s o b which was one of his strong points. Leave it to Jean Harlow and Clark Gable to foil his nasty plans. A very entertaining film."
4,Gable Harlow and Beery,"Good old fashioned adventure/romance like they can't make anymore. I hadn't seen it in a long time when I purchased the DVD and was surprised by the absence of a grand guns-blazing battle near the end that seemed to be set-up by the film's progress. Still, worth your dime."
5,THIS FILM IS AN AMAZING WORK OF ART STARRING MR. ROONEY,"Rooney gives the performance of his career in this epic tale of a middle school student who landed a small acting role but then went on to greatness attending Scranton U. and then becoming a social studies teacher at a Long Island high school. Some scenes from the Scranton Motor Lodge may not be suitable for young viewers. To sum it up, this movie is Terminator 2, Debbie Does Dallas, and The Godfather all rolled up into one convenient VHS tape."
5,A FAVORITE,"This one of three movies (""Benji"" being one and ""The Adventures of Milo and Otis"" being the other) that I did not edit before showing other peoples' children. I love it for its family spirit and its good lessons. It has a plot and children will actually sit through it, two things sometimes difficult to reconcile."
5,Great Family movie,"The beniker gang is a great family movie. I saw it as a child and I loved it. I'm in my 30s and still thought it was great, they don't make them like this anymore."
3,The Beniker Gang,"This is a cute movie. A very young Andrew Mccarthy did a good job as the ""father figure"" for four orphans that he helped to escape from the orphanage in order to keep them together as a family. It's funny and heartwarming to see the progress of the group of young people as they manage to succeed where many others would have failed. If you are one of the people who have seen the movie, didn't you just love the judge? Arthur proved his ability to take care of these kids as good as any adult could. If you have read any of my other reviews you must know I am a big Andrew Mccarthy fan. He has only disappointed me once so far. Check him out on Amazon and try some of his movies. You might become as much a fan as I am. But I do recommend this movie for those who would just like a pick-me-up feeling.It doesn't require deep thought. It just entertains. Isn't that what we all need sometimes? Enjoy!!"
5,Ensure Plus,"Product arrived in good time as promised. Cost is a little higher than when on sale in grocery store or in warehouse store but factoring in the regular quantity needed and time, gas, and energy needed to shop and haul to second story of a condo building, Amazon's subscription service is a great deal."
4,So Hollywood,"Such a great CD, every song makes you feel as if you are in Los Angeles enjoying a great day in the sun with your friends!"
5,Good Product,"The product sent was the same specified and is a good item.... el producto enviado fue identico al especificado, me llego y es un buen producto..."
2,Could Have Been Alot Better,"I had high hopes for this book. The first story wasn't bad, but it fell short in the end. It was never explained why these supernatural events occurred, and left me hanging and wanting alot more ""story"". I didn't like the second story, and I feel that it wasn't even scary.The third install could have been great. The part when the boys dare the other one to jump over the falls and what he saw when it did jump, set the tone for a very nice scary mystery, but the author ended the story to abruptly and that ruined the story for me.Overall, the best thing about this book was the cover, but I wound up losing it."
3,"Works, but doesn't smell good","I had high hopes for this since it doesn't contain glycerine, but it doesn't smell good. It lasts a decent time, but we are very unhappy with the funky smell."
3,"Don't believe the hype, not that impressed","True this doesn't get sticky or tacky but it doesn't last that long, and it actually is like lotion, it rubs into your skin instead of sliding ON your skin. It disappears like lotion. Haven't tasted it and don't want to because it's like lotion blek...pump is handy."
2,Not very good,I used this product in the past before and it was good. I don't know if the manufacturer changed the formula or what. This product now also dries out much more quickly then it did the last time I bought it.The seller I got this from was great 5 stars to him/her.
4,Works Good,"Been trying to find the right lubricant for what I was looking for...Water base,No bad oder,cleans up good, and needs to have a good taste or no taste...After reading all the reviews it was between this and pjur..So I thought I would order the smaller bottle just to see if it was worth my time..This stuff is good slick and cleans up great and has no taste the only downfall is it doesnt last real long about 15 20 min then have to reaply but its water base so you can just add a little water to get it back into shape..I would def recomend this if your looking for a good lube."
5,Great product,"Have used several lubes in the past. Tis one ""just works"" for me. No odor, no tacky feeling.Love it!"
4,they love it.....,"it's everything men need to take advantage on any night to create that hot sensual boom. ""liquid silk"" makes them ask were can get this product? it's make anyone who? has never use this. ""liquid silk"" demand! silk. its so hot...yes............................................................."
2,Evil Parabens!,"I was so excited to give this a try. When I got it I excitedly opened it. 2 seconds later when I read the ingredients my excitement disappeared. Parabens are all up in it. I know I should have read the ingredients but I thought since it was a ""high"" end lube it wouldn't have junk in it. My vagina is super sensitive so this lube won't be coming near it but I opened it so I guess I will use it on my partner. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because it I do like the texture. Still super disappointed.I recommend:Sliquid Organics Natural Gel 8.5 fl ozIt's long lasting, vegan, organic, and paraben free. This stuff is amazing. I wish I had never tried anything new."
4,"Perfect consistency, but dries much too fast","The consistency was better than anything else I've tried (and I've tried a lot) - smooth, slippery, but without being greasy, slimy, or sticky. The thickness was also just right - goes on smoothly, not gloopy, but not too watery as to be dripping everywhere either. The problem is that you need to use a lot and reapply every MINUTE or so. It dries way too quickly for a product of this nature.In summary, I'd buy it again because I like the feel, but next time I'm going for the bigger bottle because this won't last long!"
1,not as advertised,Very runny and not as good as popular brands. Expensivefor the small amount in jar. will not order again.
3,i give it a C+,"ok my only problem with this foundation is that it feel so thick and like i dont know how to explain but it just feels very thick, its the best way i could describe it but otherwise it provides good coverage and color is good to"
2,"Movies are OK, but full-frame only...","These movies from Lionsgate are available at a fair price, but they reuse old transfers (likely from original video sources). They are not remastered at all, and are all presented full-frame only. I would not recommend the set unless you are a fan of one of the films. I don't expect perfection from older films, but if Severin, Code Red or even Anchor Bay had released these, they would probably be properly framed at least."
5,4 movie horror collection,I bought the collection for the silent night deadly night movie but was pleasently surprised with slaughter high. i had seen my best friends a vampire before..in fact i previously owned it. if you like spoof movies then repossessed is one to check out
4,GOOD HUEY LEWIS & THE NEWS CD,"This cd is great.It has Huey Lewis & The News' first two albums on the same cd!!!Their self titled debut and Picture This are great albums featuring such hits as ""Some of my lies are true(sooner or later)"", ""Trouble in Paradise"",""Now Here's You"", ""Workin for a livin"", and their first top ten hit ""Do you believe in love?"" I love this cd.It's a good value,an awesome import.One of my favs. Anyone who is a fan of Huey Lewis & the News should own this particular one."
3,Good value for the money however I still can't play well,It is a very well organized book divided into easy reading catagories. The illustrations could use a bit of work however it was a overall average book.
4,Ehh what can be said for this,replacement media for a good filter i would buy another and probably will in a few months. can also be used as a prefilter by cutting a hole in the sponge.
2,NO SPARKLE,"The entire book was in the same format as the cover. Simple, flat images that did not display the nature of the snowflake, just the structure. It almost appeared to be renderings, all the same size across the page. There was no reality to them."
5,Great book!,"Snowflakes in PhotographsYou can't imagine the variety of design in each individual snowflake until you these photographs. From simple to complex, these photos show how absolutely symmetrical and stunning these fragile crystals are."
4,bently snowflakes,"Good glossary of snowcrystals. You can spend hours with them. Given the technology of the time, they're best suited for studying by catagory as opposed to individual morphology. (Libbrect does surpass this work-better photographic technology)"
2,KYB SM5141 Strut Mount,"Don't be fooled by the photo for this product, it does not have the boot or bumper with it. It is still not a bad price but the photo is definitely misleading."
3,Average at best.,"I have loved ancient history and mythology since I was a wee pup. Unfortunately I found ""Age of Bronze - A thousand ships"" somewhat disappointing. The Bronze Age feel to the drawings was interesting but they were not terribly artistic. The quality of the dialogue is fair but way below any classical Greek literature, which helps to make the story drag (quite unlike the original Iliad). The lack of Gods or spirits (as such) also helps to squeeze out the magic. The [explicits] and violence is PG-13. The glossary of names, genealogical chart, and bibliography are very good."
4,easy to use,"bought these for my bmx so I could get the rear tire straight and tight, these worked perfectly and very easy"
5,A treat for spider lovers!,Great for Halloween but I wear mine all the time because I simply like spiders! The earrings are beautifully made and hang perfectly when worn. I bought the matching pendant which is just as lovely. Can't go wrong with this purchase. Fast shipping and well packed.
2,Could have been better,I thought that this book would be in better condition. A lot of the pages were bent and wrinkled and the back cover had a sticker the was ripped off. Overall quality - POOR! The book was packaged nicely and shipped fast.
3,"Great book, insane pricing","I got this book as a present off my wishlist, thankfully getting a used copy instead of at that ripoff price.At this point, the price is a $135! Really?You can tell the REAL value by the ""sell back your copy"" price, which is currently $16.It is a pity that such a valuable book is being kept out of the hands of students because of greed.The book itself is a mine of information, covering everything from the birth of photography through to the digital age.Most importantly it give a knowledge grounding that all of the ""How to"" books can never give."
4,Very comprehensive,"This book definitely covers pretty much everything -- sometimes in ultra-minute detail -- that you would need to know in order to understand the basic fundamentals of the art of photography. For anyone with medium to advanced photographic experience, this book will have a lot of pages to skip. However, even for those expert photographers, this book contains a lot of odd technical details that are required for testing for certification (such as for PPA) that you may have forgotten since high school, or that you just may have never learned on your own through self-study and/or trial and error. In short, this book is a valuable reference to have handy for any serious photographer."
4,Bought this book for school,"I didn't really use it much, unfortunately. It really is an amazing book, it's got everything you need to know in it."
2,NEVER GOT THE BOOK!!,"I ordered the book because buying thru the school bookstore was very expensive. Found the company thru Amazon and the price was right! At the end I never got the book and I probably have to buy at the regular price. My experience with buying thru the internet in this instance was bad! I have to say though, that the customer service was good, and they tried to find the solution to my problem."
2,Disappointed,"I have read other books from Frommer and have been very satisfied. That is, until I read this book. I was quite disappointed in this book. The author didn't seem like she enjoyed writing this book or even enjoyed traveling through Thailand at all. I would look else where before buying this book."
1,Most disappointing Frommer's guide,"Am usually a huge fan of Frommer's guidebooks. But am disappointed to say that this book was not helpful in ANY way ! There is nothing useful here - from overall insight, to presenting specific materials in a usable, organized format.. NOTHING ! Even the shops she recommended would've been difficult to find without a good map in the book. Most bothersome of all, it seems like the author doesn't even like Thailand very much and it is reflected in her review of attractions, various warnings, etc. Thailand is a beautiful, interesting country with much to offer for any type of traveler. We went to Bangkok and the Southern coast and did not use the book at all- for planning or during the trip.Considering that there is no content, this book was very heavy to travel with ! ..."
1,Disappointment,Disappointing to say the least. The simple philosophies that are used to achieve their outstanding results are lost in a quagmire of quotes. It would have helped if they included a summary at chapters end setting out the management strategies and how they operationalized those strategies.
1,Written like a college research paper,"Just a bunch of quotes from other articles and resources about the Patriots. There are literally over 2,000 listings in the Endnotes.I'm not through the whole book yet, but I'm beginning to wonder if he even talked to one soul at the Patriots himself. Looks like he just used others' research and consolidated it into one place like a lame college paper.Avoid and wait for a book by someone who has inside info or by Belichick himself."
4,Classic book - dated ideas,"Ok this book isn't for everyone, but then what book is? The ideas are somewhat outdated. But then the book was written in the 1920s, this was well before the Stonewall riots. So for that fact alone the book is ahead of its time.Also the book is a hard read. Don't expect to finish it off in a single sitting. Its a hard read but if you keep an open mind, it is worth it."
4,A forgotten classic,"The Well of Loneliness (1928) has great interest in its choice of a topic that brought the author to a literary trial and created a famous scandal in the 1920's: lesbian love. The novel examines the attitudes that makes a society intolerant and homophobic despite being cultured and wealthy. Many writers, such as Virginia Woolf or E.M. Forster, stood up in defense of the author and freedom of speech. Now the themes seem sightly faded, but still have vital interest."
2,not so great,"While this book has merit as a ""literary classic,"" it's value doesn't go much beyond that. For the most part, the story was interesting, though it certainly had its slow parts. But Hall's language and writing style is unrefined and leaves much to be desired. If you read it outloud, you realize just how cheesy and unrealistic some of the conversations and narrative really are. By the end of the book, I was glad to be done with it."
5,The best book ever. I would say that it saved my life.,"It's well written, great characters, easy to read and it's revolutionary message is timeless. The Well of Loneliness is my favorite. I read it once a year to keep myself alive."
5,Anything Moffatt!,The song Crazy is really good...very upbeat. Lara is a romantic ballad and Ya Ya is just plain nice. It's very worth it.
5,Decorate Your Garden,"Lots of gorgeous color photos showing ways to spice up your garden with objects such as steel wire garden furniture, mirrors, and other unique items. What fun. -Linda Fry Kenzle, author of Gathering"
1,Huh?,"Okay, Amazon, this must be one of your beta listings for mindreaders. This listing says this is John Williams the composer, not the guitarist, but that detail is wrong a good bit of the time in your listings. Does this album contain original soundtrack music, or is it rerecordings? How many traacks are there? What are the names of the tracks? How long is the total amount of the music? What orchestra performed the music? Who conducted the orchestra? Would you buy this album without knowing this basic information? A little bit of help here, Amazon, sure would go a long way!"
1,bad recording,worst live recording ever! sounds like a very bad bootleg. stay away from this one. could not evan listen to the whole cd.
3,Its Foam,There isn't a whole lot to say about these filters. I find them a bit pricey for what it is ( a block of foam that happens to be the right size for your filter) but they do effectively filter fish waste as they're supposed to...
5,works!,the filter works great and fits perfect in the chamber .... very porous which is essential for the growth of bacteria
1,waste of money,"use white felt from fabric store, put thru wash machine, no soap, then dryer no softener, cut to squares insert into filter where it is the last thing your water goes over or thru before going back into tank. you will be amazed"
3,Digimon Rules! (the game of course!),I bought the game just for a little laugh at Bandai's Pokemon imitation. It turned out to be a whole lot more than I expected! I am definitly bought buy the strategy guide! You get to raise your own cute (or weird!)Digimon.
1,not very helpful,really nothing much to say except that the guide was not helpful in helping me play the game.
1,It has not arrived yet,"I have been waiting for long time, but I steal don't receve my goods. I would like to ride not wait........."
1,I got just plain tired...,"of Falcon's frustrated attempts to bring the ""Flower"" around...Jasmine sincerely seemed to detest him. I would have given up and couldn't understand why he didn't. When she finally decides to ""submit""...I just didn't believe it. Jasmine is spoiled, stubborn and childish. Sorry! I am usually fond of her books/characters/story lines...this was not one of them."
3,Not her best,Although Henley is one of my favorite authors. This is not her best work. She should have spent more time developing her characters and less time creating conflicts that pop-up randomly. The lovers spent to much time in conflict. And there lack of loyalty is hard to enjoy. Most of her other books flow better
3,this girl is a b****,"I bought this book because I love The Marriage Prize and wanted to check out the rest of the series, but the heroine is SO annoying that I'm only reading because the hero is not. If you like reading about spoiled, selfish, childish heroines then this book is for you, but don't be surprised if you want to slap this girl for most if the story, she could use it. As a matter of fact, the one time she did get hit I found myself nodding in agreement. Sad."
2,Not my Favorite Henley novel...,"I agree with many other readers, the heroine Jasmine is very annoying. I was very irratated by the constant references to her being so ""delicate"" and ""ethereal."" She is small and petite, I think it is obvious. I thought the hero Falcon was ok. I did like how her gave her a run for her money by actually bedding someone else. You almost wish he ended up with her instead of Jasmine.I was very disappointed because I loved ""The Dragon and the Jewel"" and ""The Marriage Prize."" I only read this book because I had read the other two and thought I was missing something. I don't even think it set a very good stage for the other novels.I love Virginia Henley but, this one is just not on the same level as the others that she has written."
2,Unlikable Heroine,"I enjoyed the first hundred pages of this book. Then it became apparent the heroine was completely spoiled and willful. Just because a heroine is ""angelically"" beautiful on the outside doesn't mean she has a great personality. It got so bad I skimmed the last hundred pages. Skip this one..."
1,I could'nt even finish...,"...this book, and that's a rarity for me. Can this be the author who wrote ""A Year and a Day""? The hero is quite sexy and the historical detail is very good, but the heroine is such a brat that I couldn't believe the hero still wanted her no matter how beautiful she was. The girl simply didn't deserve her man or the print it took up to write about her. She is a spoiled child who never really grows up. Although I abhor abuse in novels, I was rooting for someone to knock her senseless by the middle of the book. Ms. Henley is known for her characters who are buffeted by the historical events that involve them, but I just couldn't care what happens to this couple."
4,bodice ripper,"i read the book before and spilled fruit punch all over my original copy, so i wanted another. the cover on the first publication was more interesting then this one. the story is typical of the genera and era of bodice rippers, so if you don't like them, this book is not for you. Also, the book villianizes prince john of England/ and even invokes robin hood, so if you're not interested in either of these characters fictionalized, once again this book is not for you. I enjoy the charachters strong sense of self and firm directions they choose for themselves. the story is a setting in which two people who are complete individuals form a very strong bond despite the chaos around them. In this generation the story is a bit out of touch and far fetched, but true medieval life was gritty and violent, and if you keep that in mind you'll fit right in."
2,Think Twice!,"Illegitimate Jasmine is THE FLOWER. Falcon de Burgh is THE FALCON. As the heroine, Jasmine spends most of the book changing her mind. She is childish, she hisses, she snaps, she hates Falcon, she marries Falcon, she vows distance, she fantasizes, she wants, she changes her mind, she hates! What can I say? ""Jasmine is a difficult heroine to like!"" What an understatement!While the hero isn't much better - as heros go - at least Falcon de Burgh deserves some credit in dealing with the very annoying Jasmine! That is . . . until . . . he strikes her!Unfortunately, this is my first Virginia Henley book. I only hope THE FALCON AND THE FLOWER is not the normal Henley standard!MaryGrace Meloche."
4,Historical and romantic,"I love Virginia Henley's love for history, as I do. Her research for her novels in itself is enough to keep me reading to find out more about the outcome of the particular historical event she's penning. Her heroes are extraordinary. Especially the 'Falcon'. He was man enough to put up with Jasmine's undecidedness, and sometimes just downright childish behavior. He was patient, which in itself made him an extraordinary man. But once Jasmine fell in love, she was his most loyal supporter. She sacrificed herself for her family. Again, 'she did what a woman had to do'. One reader commenting the novels said the history was 'mumbo jumbo', but it is a fact that Virignia Henley is a REAL historical writer, in the true essence!"
3,Fun but not great,"The book was entertaining throughout but I had a problem with the fact that Falcon hit Jasmine. From the descriptions, Falcon was a large man while Jasmine was small. I realized she could be infuriating but that wasn't a reason for him to hit her. Otherwise, I enjoyed the mysticism and the political intrigue of King John's court. Henley's research of Matilda DeBraose (sp ?) is supported by books written by Barbara Erskine. This book could have been better. I enjoyed Henley's recent releases (Dream Lover, A Year and A Day, and A Woman of Passion) much more."
2,Not so great,"After reading this book, I sat back and wondered ""Now what was that about?"" Frankly, I got tired of all the sex, not that I'm a prude by any stretch of the imagination. What bugged me throughout this book was the constant ""ache"" Falcon had for Jasmine and how she continued to turn him down. And then, suddenly, when she gets pregnant she loves him. Please. It was so unbelievable. I'm all for a fiesty heroine and a dark, brooding hero, but for God's sake this was ridiculous. And the shenanigan's at King John's court were just plain silly. I only read this for the historical content and I was sadly let down with that too. This won't be one I repeat."
1,This was the worst book ever!,"I can't believe I wasted hours of my life reading this book!! The main characters were absolutely AWFUL to each other. Like many male protagonists of the romance genre, he was very arrogant. Arrogance/confidence is okay to some degree, but Falcon was mean...downright mean and hateful to Jasmine. Jasmine was a complete and spoiled rotten brat, as well as a first degree witch. I know a good story needs some conflict, but GOOD GRIEF! I found myself hating both characters because of their deplorable behavior towards each other!! I honestly don't even know why I bothered to finish the book. I guess I kept hoping it would get better, but it truly never did.Don't waste your money on this one! If you want a well-written love story, try Julie Garwood, Hannah Howell, Monica McCarty, Kinley McGregor, or Galen Foley."
3,Not as good as can be...,"I bought this book after reading some of the ratings on Amazon.com, and I have to agree with most of them that this book was lame. I read and read until I got to page 300 until they finally had sex, and i would have to disagree that if she was a white witch, she would have had more passion that what they showed in the book. I was very disappointed. I did already buy the other books in the series, so i better get it over with and see if they fare any better. The heroine seemed very self absorbed and selfish and could not admit she was wrong and judged everone to harshly. I would think that Falcon would have given up on her long ago."
2,Spoiled brat blows off nice guy and he puts up with her,"Setting -- England/Wales/Ireland 1199 to 1202The most interesting aspect of this book is the history element. It's set in the early days of the realm of King John - the king who was so bad that the barons forced the Magna Carta on him.As for the romance, virtually every romance novel involves overcoming obstacles to finding true love. Usually the pair are from warring countries or he's killed a family member or something serious is in the way. In this book, there is no good reason for our heroine not to be willing, if not thrilled, to be betrothed to Falcon. He's young, handsome and even on the same side. Why he puts up with her running off to court and total self-centeredness is hard to understand.Still, the pace is enough that I never doubted that I'd finish the book. It's the first of a trilogy (with The Marriage Prize and The Dragon and the Jewel). I doubt I'll go out of my way to read the other two volumes."
3,The Feelings Not Back!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The feeling is not back with this cd. It's rather a new feeling. It's obvious Chuck only did this album to showcase his flugelhorn playing, otherwise there would be more drums and guitars. This is a smoother soulful album, and is nice to listen to. But when I'm really in the mood for listening to music, I need a loud energetic album to fufill my needs! If you like mello latin jazz, then this is the album for you. If you like the old Chuck Mangione, then this album is not for you.There are some highlights of this album, like the opener. And there are some cool things about this cd, like the appearence of old time buddy, Gerry Niewood, but for overall listening enjoyement, this was a bust!!!!!!!!"
1,Chuck Lost the Evening of Magic Feeling :(,"This CD was very disappointing and belongs in the elevator. Chuck, stop kidding yourself, release your double-CD, Evening of Magic, Live at the Hollywood Bowl album. You should re-unite with James Bradley Jr, Charles Meeks, and Chris Vadol and release your feelings in an upbeat ""Children of Sanchez"" type album. I am hoping that he doesn't play this crap during his upcoming concert in Tarrytown, NY. BELLAVIA!"
1,The Feeling ISNT back,"If you like Chuck Mangiones style and like how he writes all of his own songs, then you wont like this album. His new album Sucks! All of the songs are contemporary, almost none of the songs are his, and no one from his origional band is in this album, its all a bunch of loosers. I recomend you keep your money and dont buy this Album, its a big disapointment."
4,Put together!,Amazing how he matches ancient sites with geometric patterns. This book is fascinating.How did the ancients know this advanced method of building monuments and placing these monuments in thier precise spots.
1,Total nonsense,This book starts out with nothing and ends with nothing. The author decided what he thought was true and then set about 'proving' it by joining up dots on a map. Having invented an imaginery circle he then goes on to weave a web of self-delusion. This is the very worst kind of book that gives a bad name to other writers who are attemping to unravel the mysteries of the past.
5,Great Book for Kids,"I read this book with my kids and they were fascinated. They memorized many of the scriptures because some of them were also in other stories within the same book. They noticed that and were able to memorize them. I highly recommend this book because, in the world we live, kids need to know there is a God in heaven who loves them, cares for them, and wants the very best heaven can offer. Adults could also learn from the stories found in the book."
1,not worth it,bought these little over a year ago and they are all ready broke one lens cracked two weeks after I bought them other broke about a month ago
1,What Absolute Garbage,"I purchased a Siemens Gigaset 2.4 GHz Phone for about $279 + tax expecting a quality product, and was perplexed when I repeatedly faded out when talking. The callers could not hear me but I could hear them. This made the phone unusable. So I returned the phone to the dealer and got another identical unit that had exactly the same problem. I was convinced on the phone by Siemens tech support that there must be problem with the wiring in my house - even though I am an electrical engineer and should have known better. I later found that the phone did not work at another location, and thus that the problem was with the two shoddily designed Siemens phones all along. Siemens was unresponsive to my complaints. What absolute garbage. I will NEVER purchase another Siemens product."
1,absolutely awful system,"The system worked fine for ten months. Then one handset failed, then another, and so on. By the time I realized there was a malignancy, the warranty had expired. This is useless junk."
4,Almost Perfect,"I really like this phone. Reception is great in my house, but range is a bit disappointing. At least it works fine in my yard. Most important features are the sound quality and multiple handset capability. It feels better in my pocket than a PCS phone - I keep it there so I never lose it. The built-in antenna is a great feature. Disappointments are in the call display and voice mail features. I wish it had a ""message waiting"" indicator and a ""xx Missed Calls"" indicator. I also wish it could look up numbers from its directory for incoming calls with number display but no name display. I bought a cheap desk call display unit to replace some of these features, but it should be in the phone. Finally, I wish Siemens offered an option between the 2402 and 2420 that added a full duplex speaker phone in the base unit, but not voice mail, corded handset, etc."
4,Nine month user,"I've found the Siemens Gigaset 2402 to be the best cordless phone system that I've ever used. The voice quality is very good. The programable feature set is amazing. There are so many features, that it's probably not a good choice for someone who wants simplicity or is technophobic. If you have two phone numbers and want many different programmable features, digital security, the ability to transfer calls to other handsets and clear reception, this is a great choice. The intercom, conference and call transfer features are powerful. You can have up to 8 handsets per base station. My only disappointment was the system's range. I would estimate that the range is about 75 to 150 feet in our house. We have a fairly large house and have found some fringe areas."
2,Not very good quality and not convenient,"I would have thought slim handpiece design would be easy to handle, but a thicker handset would be easier to hold between your shoulder and ear. Also, the unit spends a lot of time looking for the base unit, even when 10 feet away. Also, if you spend time multi tasking while using this item, you will hear a constant beep as your cheeks will push the menu buttons frequently."
1,junk,"I purchased a Siemens base phone and 5 cordless phones. Within 6 months 3 of the 5 phones had garbled transmissions which made them unusable. Siemens support says ""too bad"" we only service warranty items, just buy new phones. What crap! Horrible product from a company that is even worse."
1,Electronic Garabage-DO NO BUY,"Rated one star because there doesn't appear to be a ""no star"" option. I can't tell you how disappointing this phone system is. The best thing about it is I only bought two handsets (I had intended on eventually having four).They work great for a month and go rapidly downhill. Poor range becomes no range. One handset will not work in the same room with the base station. I believe it is a battery issue but the phone indicates a full charge. My family has issued me an ultimatum to get rid of these and replace with anything that works."
1,Seimens Gigaset 2402 is Total crap!,"I've had this phone for two years. Since day one I have had trouble with the audio ""warbling"" on both receive and transmit making it it nearly impossible to understand the caller. I have had Seimens replace both the base and the handset twice (I had to forcefully press them them to exchange anything). The problem seems inherent in this phone's design. The unit is not near any microwave or any other transmitter. I can stand 2 feet from the base and the problem persists. Strangely, when I slap the handset in my palm sharply the sound clears up for a few seconds.Seimens support is as terrible as the phone. They refused to refund my money after swapping out the entire phone twice. So I am forced to live with a $300 phone that drives my wife crazy.I will never buy any product made by Seimens again."
2,Don't buy-read further,"I'm taking this back to the seller for two reasons. First, I've inserted fully charged Ni-Cd and NIMH batteries in it on separate occasions and the usage is disgusting. The batteries have used up all the charges within one day. Second, Siemens' 2xxx phones cannot be used when DSL service is installed on the same line, per two separate calls with Siemens. Beware!"
2,not worth the money and over featured for average house,"ditto for all the complaints. Handsets cut in and out and too small to hold on neck. We thought the extra features would be handy, but frankly we never use them.Can somebody build a decent cordless that lasts?"
1,Please read this review before buying,I have had this phone with 3 handsets for about a year. The battery life is very poor and the quality is like phones from 10 years ago. What a dissapointment. I wish I read all these reviews before buying. Some cool features are included but if you can't hear or talk well with them what use are they.
1,Poor sound quality sabotage a good idea,"I thought this phone had cool design with its small size and lack of antenna. What I found out is the designers sacrificed basic functionality for whiz-bang gadget appeal. The most important feature of a phone is sound quality, and the sound quality of this phone is very poor. It is very difficult to hear people talking even in a quiet room, and if you turn up the volume the mic just picks up more room noise and makes it worse. There also some basic functions that are made overly complex. To use redial for example you are forced to toggle through several menus on the LCD screen rather than just hitting a button. The phone is also too small to hold comfortably and it looks like a remote control and gets lost on the coffe table."
1,Buy this phone at your peril,"I loved this phone when I first got it. A friend had a set, so I bought 'em for my home and my small business. They worked great for quite a while. Then the trouble started.After about 12 months, the batteries completely die - expect to replace them regularly.My friend who also had this set started having a serious problem about 16 months into his ownership. ALL of his handsets started ""skitching"" when he used 'em. The outgoing sound would crackle in and out. You can twist the phones themselves and it stops for a brief time.At about the same point in ownership, around 16 months, my set started doing the same thing. I expect my 8-month old office set to have the same problem in the near future.This defect makes these phones unusable. Purchase this Siemens set and you'll love them for a little over a year. Then you'll curse Siemens daily as you shop for a replacement."
2,The STATIC Maker!!!,"This phone is horrible! I would never buy it again. This is the second Siemens 2402 system i've had in the past year, and each system gives an extreme amount of static and cuts out worse than a cell phone in an area without reception when you are 2 feet from the bas or 2 blocks from the base - the phone has the same problems. If it weren't for the lousy clarity and constant static and breaking up - this phone would be a #6 on a 1-5 scale!!!"
1,Nice system,"I have had the same handset and batteries for two years now (handset made in USA).I spilled coffee on the handset and some buttons became a little insensitive while still usable, but that is my fault. Interference is a problem only when using the microwave. The sound quality is superb under the conditions I require.The base station location with this and any system is absolutely critical. I had no problems with setup of any kind. The manual is simple, complete and easy to understand."
1,Terrible!,"Terrible! I've had trouble with this phone since I got it. The reception is horrible, it sounds like you are underwater when you speak. People on the phone with you cannot even understand your words. No matter how close or far from the base station, it's the same: terrible. Cool looks, nice features, unusable. Digital phones, for the most part, simple don't work well. I've gone through many. This one, however, is the worst of the lot."
5,Excellent,"Excellent parenting book. Doesn't focus on techniques, but rather teaches clear and logical parenting principles. My favorite part was learning how detrimental artificial consequences can be."
3,"Rented it, and was pleased, but","This game is just way too short. Everyone is right. I rented it and saw for myself.The game takes place in the wild west, and it does a good job of recreating the feel of western movies. Walking around in Dodge is great, as it feels real.The fighting in the game is fairly good for the most part. Once you get cooler guns it gets better. Also, if you ever feel mad you can go on killing rampages and kill everyone in town. The showdowns would be better if you could pick up shotguns and stuff off corpses, but you can't. It seems the creators want you doing the missions rather than killing random people.The game suffers from length. It also suffers from some slowdowns. Occasionaly my game will slow down during a gun fight and I'll watch my health go down to zero.The best part about the game is the story and voice acting. The game feels like a movie more than a game, and it's interesting to watch it unfold.This is a renter, but absolutely not a buyer."
3,gun,"this is a very fun game if you like cowboys and indians thew controls are realatively simple it has classic cowboy action,riding horses shooting bad guys fighting indians and a twist of fighting with indians overall the game was fun and mildly suspensefull but really short there are side missions but if you follow the story and do just the main objectives the game takes about 4 hours to beat but fun none the less"
2,Very short and limited,"This game would have been a lot better if it were more similar to GTA. I was looking forward to making my way over a vast area and maybe parking it on a high rock and picking off indians and other innocent people and animals with a broader range of weapons. The levels were a since to get through.Oh well, maybe Gun II."
3,Totally a rental,"I liked the idea behind this game and it's great to see horse-riding finally done well, but the targeting system while you're walking really sucks. The controls are something to get used to and still they kind of annoy. I'd be running someplace and have to make a turn, but if I don't use the right analog stick to turn the camera with my body, I'll be looking one place and running another. Grand Theft Auto it isn't.I love the voice acting and the side missions. I played Texas Holdem in a bar and racked up a lot of cash - I'm a good player in real life and this version is scaled down for novices, so I got paid!Nice graphics and though it seems free-roaming, invisible walls often stop you in your tracks if you run or ride too far out into the plains.It's short too. If you want to just breeze through a game, pick this up at Blockbuster or someplace over the weekend."
5,Love this game - a classic.,"For a PS2 game, this is game is very well done. It has a very short, but engaging story line and the graphics are superb (for a PS2 game). You play as a lone, Western hunter who is on a journey to find the man who murdered his father. On the way, you help liberate towns, ride some horses, dig for gold, play some poker, escape (or shoot) gun-wielding bandits and corrupted law-men, and overall engage in activities that were common in the old west. If you love westerns and/or a good shooting game, this should be satisfactable."
4,Awesome shooting game,"A must have game!!! Although its too short, money is worth it. The game is western-themed action adventure. You can complete the game in no time or you can take your time by playing pokers, chasing bandits, and so on."
4,Great game but I got stuck,"Epic storyline. But be aware that I got stuck on easy. In other words, the game was the best western style game i've played so far: though I haven't played Call of Juarez Bound in Blood yet."
3,"Good product, just like described but...","Good product, just like described but the reception could use some help. This connected wonderfully to all the phones I've used it on, but i assume from the size, there wasn't much room for an antenna. It gets static after only 2-3 feet away. It's still usable, but the static gets annoying. It also makes itself known when moving either the phone or the headset. I would like to see a standard USB charger, instead of the proprietary one (i lost mine after a month, so my headset is useless). Over all the size and fit in my ear was great. It had plenty of volume, and i had no problem with listeners saying they couldn't hear me, except for in gust of wind. Over all I can only give this a 3 out of 5, because of the small flaws."
5,Patti's solo debut album remains a cult classic.,"Originally issued in 1976, ""End Of A Rainbow"" was Patti's solo debut album for CTI Records. Although not a commercial success, this album was one of the first ever to be exclusively devoted to the Quiet Storm ""sound"" that was just-then blossoming. Patti's soulful, tender and at times wistful and melancholic vocals are nothing short of exquisite. Patti wrote all eight tracks herself and CTI boss Creed Taylor obviously spared no expenses in getting the best session players for this cult classic. Now that it's available on CD ""End Of A Rainbow"" definitely deserves a reappraisal."
4,Nearly Barbirolli,"Jansons is an excellent conductor of Sibelius, no question. I will leave discussion of his wonderful rendition of the Sibelius First Symphony to others. It is the Finlandia on this disc that I truly love. One of the things I have come to admire about this conductor is his way with making 'warhorses' sound new to me, and his Finlandia is no exception. The sound quality is truly exceptional, but the Oslo Philharmonic's recording venue does have a somewhat harsh acoustic. Still, the performance and the tempos give this particular Finalandia an edge I think."
2,Finlandia: a little fast for my liking.,"The Finlandia is a bit fast for my liking...I guess I prefer the sentimental rich slow Ormandy-esque versions. This one just doesn't stir the emotions...they kind of music that gives one the ""lump"" in the throat emotional (nationalist) feeling piece is associated with."
2,The other review was NOT true. .,"I had filled it out the right way, then it came up again. I didn't realize and I said I was happy with it thinking it was another order. This shirt is beautiful. But it would fit a 3 year old. NOT my 15 year old I bought it for. Since it was listed with other shirts that were the size we DID need. It was confusing apparently there ARE for teenagers or adults."
2,I was disapointed,"I like Deborah Cox, and I was looking forward to buying this cd. However, I have to say that this is NOT Deborah's best work and I am disapointed. Most of the songs on this cd are not that good, but I do have to say that one good thing about this cd is that the song Absolutely Not (Chanel Mix) is included, that's why I gave it 2 stars. I have to agree with what several other people said in their reviews, if you are a Deborah Cox fan buy this cd, but if you are not save your money."
5,Credit for the courage to take a chance on change.,"Hurray for D.C. Yes, after four (??) long years she has graced us with her vocal skills once again; This time with something sassy, funky and hip. We all know DC has the vocal range for those love filled ballads that you play over and over again just to hear her hit those high spine, cringing notes. But it was her ability to take a chance on change that impressed me with this project. It was clever of DC to step out into a new direction to avoid ""type casting"" and show off her versatility as an artist, and still offer some classic Deborah ballads as well. If I could rate her any higher than five I would, just for the courage to step outside of what was ""expected"" of her and try something new while giving her fans such a personal look into her experiences called life. Way to go DC!"
4,This is Deborah's best work yet!,"I really love this cd. Deborah did an excellent job on this one. In my opinion, the best song on the cd is ""The Morning After"". I suggest that everyone go out and support Deborah, she is truly one talented sista."
2,Ho-hum (2&1/2 stars),"Nearly every song on Deborah's album ""One Wish"" was gold! So I picked up ""The Morning After"" without hearing any of the new songs expecting something similiar. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. A lot of the songs remind me of songs on Brandy's ""full moon"" album but even many of them were ""ho-hummish"". Too many of the songs like ""Just a Dance"" or ""Up & Down"" just don't have the ""oomph"" as her other songs. They all sound like a million other things I've heard on the radio with very little to differentiate.""Play your part"" sounds more like something Deborah could've had on her last album, and ""Oh my Gosh"" is a catchy little tune but even these songs can't seem to redeem this album. It just seems to me that almost anyone with a good voice could've done some of these songs.In all, ""The Morning After"" just didn't meet Deborah's full potential."
5,Haven't found a voice that can compare yet!,"Ms. Cox has truly outdone herself with this album. There are plenty of singers on the market with pipes, but what Deborah Cox possesses is the ability to perform a song like no other - she's a true actress. From the soaring soprano notes of Play Your Part & Hurts So Much to the funky beats of Like I Did and The Morning After, Deborah Cox takes you on a true journey with this record. You feel every emotion she sing of, and she conjures up notes Whitney Houston didn't even have in her heyday. It is about damn time for Ms. Cox to have her moment in the spotlight. Lord knows she deserves it."
2,I hope not this morning,I sorry to break hearts but Deborah could have kept this one.It was not a good follow up to this success of her sophmore effort.Please stop try to sing songs that sound like nobody suppose to be here.The Cd Drags .I really thought with the first single that the tracks would be blazed by her powerhouse voice but oh well.
1,Ugh!,"This is not what I expected from Ms. Cox. Especially after waiting so long for her to drop her next album. If I could, I would get my money back. That's how disappointed I am. When someone with as much vocal talent as her puts out such a trashy album, it really makes you wonder how low the music industry has sunk. It's such a shame that less talented artists get all the good lyrics and music. Deborah, should've stuck with what she's good at- ballads."
2,"Deborah, what were you thinking???","First of all let me state that I am not hating.....Deborah Cox has one of the strongest, most beautiful voices in humanity. Deborah, however, chose to work with some lackluster producers. All the songs that don't sound like they were done on a 1987 Casio keyboard sounded like demos that never should have made the final production. Deborah has the potential to be bigger than life, but not when she is choosing god-awful tracks. The defining characteristic that takes words and sounds and turns them into music and art is the mood that you are left in after you've heard it. The songs on this album are particularly bland and leave me with nothing but a feeling of disappointment. Maybe next time, Deborah. Be a little more picky."
5,UNDERGROUND ADVENTURE,"This is a great adventure story with non-stop action. Being trapped in a cave is for some their worst nightmare. This is as close as most will ever want to be to going into a cave. For more underground adventure stories don't miss Steward's, ""Tales of Dirt, Danger, and Darkness."""
1,Cheaper at Barnes & Noble,"This is one of the better cross stitch magazines around, but the price is half of what it is here if you buy it from Barnes & Noble. I've also noticed that when you have a subscription, the magazine arrives over a month after it was actually available at a book store. This means you'll end up getting Christmas issues after Christmas."
1,"Great magazine, but don't buy through Amazon",I just ordered this magazine directly from Cross Stitch Gold and paid $29.95 for a 1-year subscription. Why in the world would Amazon charge over three times as much for the same product??
3,"Fun, not ""wack!""","I haven't listened to this CD thoroughly yet, but there are already at least 7 songs I like: Like Glue, Gimme the Light (both versions), Get Busy, and Baby Boy are awesome, and Can You Do The Work and Shake That Thing are good, too. It sounds like a light, energetic, poppy blend of raggae and hip hop.In response to the other reviews: The 3.5 overall rating is far more accurate than the one star reviews that are up right now - what are y'all ON? Lol. I am not altogether sure what dancehall is, so I cannot comment on that, but I have heard enough raggae to say that it isn't quite that - but then, it's not SUPPOSED to be raggae! Second, he IS Jamaican: 1/2 Jamaican, 1/4 Chinese, and 1/4 Portugese. No, I am sure not all Jamaicans speak the same, saying things like ""dutty."" Does everyone in the US speak ebonics? Of course not. :)On a side note, I do miss at least one of the skits that this verson left out - but I don't buy music CDs for skits, do you? :D"
2,Dont waste your time it aint as good as you may imagine,First of all i thought this was a good album. I liked the singles Gimmie the light and Get Busy but that was about it.I was under the impression that with 20 tracks and a good beat this may be a good album guess i was wrong cause these layed out songs will put you to sleep my advice is to not buy this load of crap and download the singles cause that is the only thing good bout this cd and this is the truth.
3,Decent album,"Good album. Not every track is a winner, but a majority of it is. It's worth a purchase. It does have one track where it's just talk, but that ""NEXT"" key on the remote control took care of the problem."
4,Hear me now Christian,"Boy Christian If you nuh understand patios (dialect) wha you a do a listen dancehall music much less fe try rate um? Hush you mouth boy, you nah know wha you a talk bout. Go Listen to britney spears or subben. Wha you know bout dancehall? Sekkle.If you didn't understand half of what i said above, then i have made my point. Take it easy. You know nothing of dancehall."
5,Can he do wrong?,"No...I don't think so. I was 110% pleased with this CD! It is one of my top 5 favorites and a full time companion in my vechicle! Sean Paul is uplifting, funky, all around awesome!"
3,Not His Best Work,"I'm a fan of Sean Paul and have been since his inception. As a native of the Caribbean I'm also an avid fan of Dancehall Reggae which is slightly different from the standard Reggae. I do appreciate this album from Sean but I also know that this is not his best work. My favorites on this album, however, are ""Like Glue"", ""Punkie"", ""Get Busy"" and ""Still in Love"". I must say though, that Sean is holding his own and making dancehall known. He is unlike other cross over artists in the sense that he still features the raw Dancehall reggae music and lyrics without infusing too much Hip Hop and losing his identity in the process. What's even better is he is being recognised and he's representing his West Indian people - Big Time!!"
3,3 1/2 STARS.........Has some solid hits on here,"I don't understand why so many people are getting on here and saying that this CD sucks because you can't understand what he is saying. If that is what you think then you should've stayed away from this CD in the first place. I can't understand what he says on the couple of singles that have hit the radio but they are still so pretty decent songs. You know what he sounds like so people shouldnt act suprised when they listen to it. I'll admit that at this point right now, I dont want to hear another Sean Paul song for a while but that doesnt take away from the solid songs that he has put together on here. Such as Gimme the Light, Like Glue, Get Busy, Baby Boy, and Top of the Game. If you like Sean Paul then check this CD out. If you dont like him stay far away from this. The only reason why I have it is because someone gave it to me, but he still deserves a little credit."
3,Party Rocker For Sure,"Admittedly, I don't have the faintest idea as to what Sean Paul is singing/talking/toasting/rapping about but this is a fun, shake your groove thang, head bobber. I don't know how anyone can sit down when they put this on. The beats and grooves are just hot. Aside from the hits and songs that got some radio play, Shout, International Affair, Concrete, and Punkie are stand-outs. Sean Paul did his thing on this one and he's a cutie too!"
1,He can't write lyrics and he can't sing.,"I really really hat this guy. I've looked at his lyrics and they make no f***ing sense! I am getting sick of all these music videos about Bling Bling and girls with big booties. It's absolutely rediculous, I am gonna get slammed for this review. At least I march to the beat of my own drum. Believe me I am reviewing this fairly, His lyrics are complete nonsense, it's like he slapped together some cool words and threw in some music so that everyone would like it. Sean Paul cannot sing his way out of a paper bag. Please even that guy who sang Like A Virgin on American Idol was better than him, at least what he was saying was clear. Sean Paul=Crap!"
1,THIS CD SUCKS!!!!!,"Don't waste your money on this CD. If I could give this CD 0 star, I would. Sean Paul's voice is annoying, and he's just trying to be dope, but he ain't. The only good songs are Baby Boy and I'm Still in Love With You. (...)"
1,Wack!,"I do not like this CD it was a waste of my money and I only like 3 tracks on it ""Gimme the Light"" ""International Affair""(the beats are ok) and ""Get Busy"" the rest are just a waste I tryed to listen to it again recently but after about 13 tracks I hated it and listened to somethin' better.The beats on this cd are alright but his voice gets on my nerves.Buy it if u like this type of music but I dontand that's all I have to say about that"
1,Umm,Yeah... usually if you wanna be a success in US you'd wanna know how to fully speak English first...
1,YOU ARE NOT BLACK SEAN PAUL!!!,I get so sick and tired of all these wiggers that are coming out of the woodwork now adays.This no talent loser is the justin timberlake of reggae.This album is boring and sean pauls voice truly annoys me.There are no good songs on here and it plainly sucks.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!
4,he looks nothing like SuperCat,"Sean Paul looks nothing like SuperCat, despite what the first review states."
3,I haven't gotten tired of it yet....a summer later,"I couldn't get ""Get Busy"" out of my head last summer. My sister bought me the CD in Italy (of all places) to shut me up. I don't know how I started liking Sean Paul...it happened suddenly and without warning, like some tropical disease. This is a pretty good CD...It's not perfect, but few things are. He's got rhythm. He can rap. He's Jamaican. That's good enough for me. There are some slipups (why is Busta Rhymes on this CD?). But overall, at a song/dollar ratio, its worth it.Standout songs: Gimme the light, like glue, get busy, concrete, I'm still in love with you, international affair, can you do the work, punkie"
2,Not So Good,"This CD could have been a good mix of Rap, Hip-Hop, Rock, and caribbean influences, but sadly Sean paul settles for a mediocre mush of songs that all sound alike. Buy the singles from iTUNES and forget the rest of the album. Sean Paul will be remembered for a few hit singles that were catchy, but in the long run he will be forgotten because he just couldn't put out a good enough album."
4,Neat-O!,"A very good album. I was actually not surprised at how good it was since it's different from the Rap that is out now. I enjoyed how the tracks flipped from New School to Old School Reggae without upsetting the flow of the album. I even liked the skits... so there you go.Best tracks are:I'm Still In Love With You (awesome song, not just my favorite song on the album, but one of my favorite songs ever.)Gimme The Light (really good track)Like GlueGet Busy (makes you want to actually... get busy)Basically, dancehall reggae has not sounded this good since I don't know when and if Sean Paul continues making stuff as good as this, then I will buy."
3,so so,"well i can give you a better analysis if the cd was in front of me which it is not at the moment but this cd is aiight..my fav track is get busy..good club banger i love dancing to this song...international affair sounds sweet and what else? still in love with you...sean is a dawg haahaa..stick to my girls like glue is promising..he should sing more songs with beyonce thats what i think to make hits lol umm and i dont remember the other songs bcuz i rarely listen to this cd but its a cool cd to have if you enjoy listening to his voice that much which i dont... i think its getts annoying and i just like the beats, music in the background more...so up to you."
3,Not as outstanding as expected..,"this album is pretty good..but not as good as i expected.it is getting a lot of play in the U.S. which is good, but...i will not say it is because it has been Americanised (if that is a word) but i expected it to be a little 'duttier'..a few more collaborations with the reggae superstars. oh well.the price paid for trying to break into the american market i guess, giving them a familiar flavor"
2,Don't waste your money.,"I made the mistake of buying this cd for one song basically. I would have saved some money had I just burn the one song that I like. The songs just really do not seem to flow very well together. There is too much down time between songs and too much talking. ""Get Busy"" is definetly the best song on the cd. I will admit I listen to it over and over and do not get tired of it. However, his newest cd ""The Trinity"" is much better."
5,I Love This Album,This album contains all of my Sean Paul favorites! A must-have. Featuring beyonce in Baby Boy! I listen to it everyday.
3,If you dont mind listen'n to the words...,Well then your in luck.. lol This album really isnt very easy to understand if you enjoy listening to what the artist has to say..Most every song on here fades out with Sean still singin or the music still playin.I suggest looking up lyrics if your real interested.. or i wouldnt bother..Sean's voice is amazing and is fairly fun to listen to.. most the music is upbeat.. so if your lookin for the sounds this it a pretty good album for you..the songs you hear on the radio are the best of the album and besides those there really arent much more dance tracks but theres enough to makeit work.
1,Down wid Raga 4 Life,"I grew up on raga. As a yout there was school, food, drink and raga. When I was old enough to hit the clubs at 15/16 I was raving to Tiger, Baju and Red Rat... Those were raga artists. Sean Paul has released two good tunes - 'give me the light' and 'like glue,' and even those tunes, although they are good they lean towards what I consider raga-pop. Sean Pauls album is for light weights who aren't into raw dancehall tunes, Sean Pauls 'give me the light' for instance isn't even comparable to Elephant mans 'Log off.' There's space in Raga for Sean Paul and at least he's better than pop artist Shaggy, however, those who recognise what true raga is need to stay away from Sean Paul or at least pick the cd up for 'easy listening' purposes only."
3,Hard to tell what he's saying,"Hip Hop's Sean Paul brought the island flavor into the Top 40. His first single ""Get Busy"" sounds great and sets the stage for Dutty Rock, his official debut album. Though his English is a little iffy and it's hard to tell what he's jabbering about on record, the beats are great in any language. Highlights are the aforementioned smash ""Get Busy,"" ""Gimme the Light,"" ""Like Glue,"" ""Baby Boy"" (with Beyonce) and ""Top of the Game."" It's not a perfect listen but it's pretty good."
1,WACK WACK WACK,"This guy is not Hiphop he is an embarasment to the world of Hiphop. I am beyond tired with Daddy Yankit, Shawn Poo and all of these other wanabe reggae latin crap rip off artists. this guys voice is just one party reefer stripclub monotone through out the entire album. this CD has absolutely NO lyrical content. dont even get me started on the music because every song on this album sounds exactly the same. Bob Marley is probably turning in his grave. 0 stars"
2,Only worth it for the radio hits...,"I like Sean Paul's style and music, but I found this album disappointing. Besides the big hits that were played on the radio (""Gimme the Light"", ""Get Busy"", ""Like Glue"", ""Baby Boy"") and ""Punkie"" and ""Can You do the Work"", I found that most of this album was uninspired and repetitive and didn't make me want to sing along or dance. If you listen to the album twice in a row, you actually feel to skip most of the tracks the second time around... I would suggest you buy his Trinity album instead, a much more interesting one. If you like his big radio successes, just download them on your iPod instead of buying the entire Dutty Rock album."
3,like glue,sean paul is a very tallented person. he has influenced the music buissnes for the good of it as he has written songs of such deatail in wording. this album has sent his career to the top of this buissnes and he will no doubt be a house hold name in the very near future.
4,um...duh!,"of course you can't understand every lyric, he has an accent. hence, the lyrics come with the cd! i personally like the cd, it has good beats & lyrics. maybe, if you're looking for a cd with a jamaican flavor and lyrics you can understand, you should pop your snow cd in the player."
4,Sean Paul's CD is Duttyfied!,"Sean Paul's ""Dutty Rock"" is one of the best dancehall albums ever. He keeps giving hits after hits continuously throughout the whole CD. Some of the end songs aren't as powerful as the songs at the beginning such as ""Baby Boy"", ""Gimme The Light"", ""Get Busy"", and ""Concrete"". His CD is very good and definentally worth the cost. Sean Paul has outdone himself for his 2nd album."
2,how sweetly beautifully amazingly BORING,"lets start with the positive, 'gimme the light' is a hot track. so are 'baby boy' 'like glue' & 'get busy'. but - get real - 21 or 22 trax is such an overkill. i cant lisen 2 it all its such jamaican rap that - let's be honest - no one understands wot hes saying 3/4 of da time. i hate im still in love with u, but compared 2 alot of the trax it is the King Of Songs. sean paul, bury urself cause no one wants 2 know..."
3,More Reggae then a twist of Reggae and Hip-Hop,"I bought this CD expecting to hear more songs like Get Busy and Gimme The Light.....and it did give a few (including the Remix and the a few of the double digit tracks).Instead I got a whole different experience. This is far more reggae than hip-hop. The beats are great, but the wording he uses is not so great but they way it flows and the way he expresses it with the music it works. The album sounds like a collection of his work that he decided to just put on a CD so the whole world could see.Personally, I will store this album in my collection and come back to it time to time. If this was put up to other rap idols this album would not win."
2,"""Dutty Rock"" just isn't as dirty as I thought....","I appreciate Sean Paul promoting his music here in America and making a presence in the urban/hip-hop scene, especially with club bangers like ""Gimme The Light,"" but I just wasn't feeling the rest of his album. ""Like Glue"" wasn't a bad track either, but I found the rest of his album to be dull. I'm not a huge fan of ""dancehall"" music but I'm always willing to step into unfamiliar territory and ""Dutty Rock"" just wasn't cutting it for me. Sorry Sean Paul."
2,reggae went pop did'nt it,"I like bob marley and peter tosh these new reggae guys just does'nt do it for me reggae went too pop for me all of a sudden nothing here interesting sean paul is taking up where shabba, and maxi priest left off."
3,man,the songs he came out wit was mad hot.beats n all. ery song on this album aint all dat but i'll give the album 3 stars cuz i wadnt feelin em' all.nice beats on here though. pick it up if u feel the need to.peace n luv~Rika
1,"SUCKS (By the way, Christian was right.)","This cd is great if your into mainstream N*Sync dance club garbage. But you'll probably hate this cd if you form opinions about music by actually listening to lyrics rather than just jumping on the bandwagon with the latest artist who has a catchy beat and makes stupid 16 year old girls wanna ""shake dat ting"" at all the under 21 clubs. This guy is downright awful. Without the beats he'd be nothing and his garbage song lyrics would be exposed. This cd gets a 1 out of 5 at the best. Don't waste your money. Believe me, the singles and the beats get old really quick, and there is not much else worthwhile on the album.And who cares if all the Sean Paul diehards come back to trash me with insults like they did to that Christian dude who actually made a valid point or two as to why this guy sucks. Even if he was wrong about music style, rap/reggae/dancehall who cares? Its still GARBAGE."
1,The best way to get a headache,"Okay, this guy cannot rap, sing, etc. Full stop. I have heard him live and he sounds like my guitar when it's untuned. He was basicly singing along with 3 other rappers and it was utter cacophony. There was no harmony, all their was was this discordant rapping.It sounded horrible and probably explains why his music isn't to impressive either. I don't know much about this style of music... but when I listened to 'Get busy' I felt there was no bass line at all. There was only was a drum beat buried by the sound of rapping/singing.I would only reccomend this to those who like R'n'B, rap, or over-procceced pop. I personally do not like the album. I believe that Sean Paul is one of those artists which gets instant success overnight and then gradually dwindles away."
4,Unusually intelligent and heart-wrenching,"Skillfully woven between the horror of experience and the constant questioning of unexplainable reasons for being ""selected"" because of sexual preference, the author speaks with chilling candor. Many detailes packed this book. Receiving brutal physical and physological treatment and forced to undergo humilations due to his homesexuality, the author despairs his treatment by ""normal"" men. Excellent reading."
2,its Okay..,"I ordered this thinking that it was an ipod nano. goodness, the picture does look like a nano though. BUT!!! it is not an ipod nano, there ARE 1 GB ipod nanos, but i guess i didn't read throughly. umm...i got this for less than half the price( about 30 dollars) and it was worth that price. NOt close to one hundred dollars. ANYWAY!! the playing sound is good, the screen is a little weird and confusing but i got it. OTHER than that this wasn't really what i expected, and whenever the batteries run out, Im going to buy the actual Apple brand 1 GB nano. HOpe this helps."
4,Chill by the pool,"This is a nice compilation to compliment the Hotel Es Vive Ibiza. Hed Kandi has taken on the job of compiling the songs and Mark Doyle does a good job. The album is a mix of BEACH HOUSE and WINTER CHILL in terms of sound. 26 tracks in all spread out over 2 discs. Highlights include ""Why"" by Therese, ""Shade of Summer"" by Cathi Ogden and Dead Stereo, Kaskade's ""Let You Go"", Fac 15 feat Cathi Ogden ""Blue Skies"", Kings of Tomorrow feat Haze ""Dreams"", and many more. Overall a nice album to chill out and relax to."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"this was my first hed kandi purchase and i must say it wasnt what i expected. i was looking for some good downtempo/funky/souful stuff but this is just generic chillout music with shallow vocals.i may give another hed kandi title a shot, but this one was very blah. save your cash, folks."
5,Adventures in Understanding,"Written at the turn of the century 1900`s David Grayson takes you to a simpler time but it is his time.In a series of books, He reminds us of the importance of Friendship, Contentment, Understanding and other social values forgotten in our active lives. My Grandmother found these books during the Depression to be an escape from everyday trials and torment of raising eight children by herself in the 20`s and through the 40`s. And she passed them on to me which I love and read over and over like she did. But I found she did not have all his books so when I find them I buy them.My collection is first edition but if you see one buy it, and read it. Your in for a treat in life of a different point of view. From a time when cars were never seen, to a time of awe of the car. A time when you made what you needed.And shared your excess."
2,Better tools out there,"This is a rather expensive tool that I would rate as barely satisfactory. It cuts poorly, sands well for limited jobs, and most other tool attachments hardly work at all. On the other hand, I am very satisfied with my Dremel variable speed tool, which always works. Save yourself the aggravation and money."
2,MULTI-MASTER OLDER PRODUCT SOLD AS LATEST,"The product is unique but the blades wear out very fast and are very expensive. What disappoints me most is that I was lead to believe that I was purchasing the latest model. In fact, it wasn't. Multi-Master advertises its tool with a easy latch to change the attachments --- what Amazon sold me was the earler model. I am very upset that Amazon sold me the product that is trying to be unloaded, instead of the newer version. Please note that I purchased this tool in late February 2007 long after the newer version was on the market. BUYER BEWARE!!"
3,"Good tool, poor accessories","The Fein multimaster is a great tool for specialty cutting jobs, provided only cutting soft materials and limited use. I have had the same experience as other users. The tool operates much like (and could be substituted for) a Stryker surgical cast saw. However, the steel blades are expensive for their limited life. The carbide and diamond blades are better if used with care. I has enabled a few jobs not possible with other tools, or saved considerable labor for some jobs (as opposed to the usual methods). But don't expect it to be a workhorse because of the limited life and special cut design of the steel blades. Sharpening would require very specialized sharpening equipment which apparently only Fein has at their factory. It is so sad that they do not offer blades make from more durable materials."
2,Fein,The blades of this product wear out so fast and are very expensive. I owned this thing for couple of years. Useless product since blade wears out as fast as you can replace it. Fein really need to come up with something else to replace their crappy blades. Do not buy this product unless you are willing to spend roughly 30 bucks for anything that you want to cut (that is how much blade will cost).
3,"Great idea, but poor implementation.",I saw this originally on their Infomercial. Bought it and was very disappointed.The instructions were basically pictogram's. In instructions on the proper use and no details as to what each pad is for.I also found the vibration a deal breaker. Just using it for a short amount caused numbing in my extremities.
5,Super product,Purchased this tool for my husband for christmas. He absolutely loves it. Has saved him a lot of time and made jobs alot easier. Its one christmas present I know he will not be returning or exchanging.
5,Mulit-Master,"Easy to handel, very little vibration. With a low sound level. It is quite industrious to detail that is enjoyable to use."
5,Thanks Chris,Thanks for playing at the SAE house Feb 4th. I really enjoyed talking to you at the Shack. You have a great talent and your music seems to touch everyone you come in contact with. Give me a call if you are in Jtown. joshua (trev's old roomie)
5,There's a lot of praising to do..... its our job...,everyone else nailed this one on the head... great hidden track.. big enough... awesome... thanks again chris please tour
4,A christian James Taylor,"Very low-key, mellow pop similar to Taylor's album Fire and Rain. Eerily similar, actually. ""Naive"" and ""One of those Days"" are my personal favorites-rainy day songs for when you turn to melancholy. The album might be a bit too downbeat though, even if the songs are lovely.One caveat: this album gets a lot of raves mostly because of the hidden one-hit wonder CCM single ""Cartoons."" If you buy it for that, that song is an outlier, hidden after the last track ""Missing You,"" starting at 6:27, and is not typical at all of the rest of the album: it's tremendously upbeat, and silly in a fun way. The rest of the album is a lot more sedate and mellow. Still great though."
2,y did everyone dis will smith's hit switch,switch was not a bad song by any means but when no one pays much attention to it and considers it a kiddy song past it prime u have a hard time enjoying it while i have to admit switch looked to be a type of song that 12 or 13 year olds would listen to that is not a bad thing either you do always have to hear those sexual hip hop and r and b joints usually make but i thought it was one of will smith's better song maybe if he released this song in the 1980s it would have been even hotter because switch has a old school beat to it he should have included rap icon ll cool j in it which would have probably made his song hit the billboard charts a bit longer i wish will could have release another song from his album i think only submitted this song and another song with his beautiful wife jada
2,"He's the Barry Manilow of rap, that's what Larry Elder said","Will Smith is a unique rapper in this generation he stills rap like he did back in the day and people don't care for that kind of hip hop. If Will wants too redeemed himself he has to use profanity other-wise he should no-longer make any music and stick to movies and his television sitcom career. His songs (Here he Comes, and Party Starter) are way too annoying, WHAT A HEAD ACK!!"
5,"Thanks for a great hip hop album, Will","I like it, and I have been no fan of will smith albums, but by chance I tried it and DAMN!!!!!!!!!!!So meaningful, and a pure, focused vent of a under-appreciated hip hop icon. Easily my favorite hip hop album of the last 3 years with the exception of Cannibal Ox's debut.Big Will, you did da damn thang!"
5,Big Willy,"""Big Will done did it again he done stepped up to the plate and he done hit it again yo get them hands up"". Big Will is back and he's back with a vengence. I don't think Will Smith is trying to play a hard role, he's just tired of people publicly disrepcting him and now he feels it's time to answer back. My personal favorite song is Party Starter but the entire album is good. It's just like with any artist. All these rappers in this game that has been dissed or talked about has came back with a diss of their own so why is it a problem when Will Smith does the same?"
5,Will's Back,He brings out his emotions and all of his doubters how it is.It is not cheezy and some tracks will even make some of his critics laugh.This album has much more of a club feel than anything he has ever done before.
4,A Needed Relief From Ordanary,Lately Every Cd ive put into my cd player/ipod/ computer have started to sound the same. same beat same lyrics. Its all sounding the same to me. Then i come across lost and found will smiths new cd. I was relived of my musical stress when i heard switch for the first time. It up tempo style is one of smiths best. Many other songs in this album accomplish the same goal: a new wave of hip hop. So if your looking for something new This Cd is for you~
5,Will Smith,"I think this CD deserves five out of five stars, I thought I would only put it on sometimes to have a good time with my friends and dance to Switch. But, today I put it on, just to see what the other songs are and from what I've heard so far, I like Mr. Niceguy and If U Can't Dance (Slide). In my opinion, I think you should buy this CD because it's fun and would be good to dance to or to just bee-bop your head. For a long time, I didn't enjoy rap, but I have always loved Will Smith!"
5,It's a Bomb dont download go out n buy da record!,"I would have to say its a great album and awesome yall need to go and pick it up and once u listen to all the tracks you will love the album even more, Once more go and buy it and it has great songs for everyone and keeps you jumoing."
4,Not Perfect...But Very Good,"Will Smith has put together a very interesting album with ""Lost and Found,"" and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and listenability of the album.Not just another perfunctory hip-hop album, there are actually a number of very good, intelligent songs to be found here; some of them about Smith's personal issues, some ""old-fashioned"" dancefloor rap tracks, and some very serious tracks about important world issues.Although this is a surprisingly good album, I don't give it the full 5 stars here for two reasons. First, I think there are too many ""dance/party"" songs on the album (It's not that they are bad songs, but this detracts slightly from the interest of the album). Second, I think that at least one of the versions of ""Switch"" could have been eliminated from the final cut.Still, I recommend this album, not just for hip-hop and rap fans, but also for pop fans and the music fan in general."
3,Poor Will hunting...........,"I give three stars for the effort, but Will's latest album sounds like he is trying to hard. His last few albums were great! They were positive, no gangster stuff, and women in his songs and videos were allowed to keep their dignity and respect. But a lot of his songs on this album sound like they are strained, he doesn't flow like he used to and he sounds a bit bitter. The only song of his that sounds like Will is the song ""SWITCH"". Everything else is like Blhhhh..{raspberry}. I found myself skipping and skipping and skipping 'til I found something descent. Will we are proud that you can rap and act at the same time, and yes we recognize that you were one of the pioneers of modern rap, but acting seems to be his niche. And if he is going to rap, he should be his natural self, not this bitter person feeling like he has to prove himself in order to stay in the game. But in general, kudos for being able to make an album anyway. Peace everyone!!"
5,Great Work from da Fresh Prince,"I really must say this album is fantastic. It's better than all his old albums because this is real Hip Hop! The beats are great and the lyrics....wow! You have to listen to songs like ""Tell Me Why"", ""Lorett"", ""Ms. Holy Roller"" or any other on that album. Every track is great. My advice...Buy it!!!"
1,LOST AND FOUND IN THE TRASH!!!!,I guess all humans cannot hear the same because this cd is complete TRASH!!!! I had no idea that Will was still rapping.
1,Rip-off,"Try this: listen to K-Os' ""Crabbuckit"" and then listen to Will Smith's ""Switch"". (""Crabbuckit"" can be found on K-Os' 2004 album Joyful Rebellion.) The 30-second samples on Amazon should be enough to let you know some serious ripping-off occurred here. I like Will Smith personally, but -- come on -- give a man his due. K-Os, talented but largely unknown outside of his native Canada, has earned it."
1,Disney Rap,"I post this message 2005. He released this album 2005. Theres 200 of this used CD going for 2 dollars. Need I say more about this album?He is a joke. Smith is trying to stir up the rap industry by rapping about others, but nobody cares!! Cause nobody listens to his music, nor do they take him seriously. Sounds like he just mixed up a recording because he needed extra money.The only good song that Will Smith made was ""summer time"". THATS IT. His lyrics are lame. Beats are weak. Like Larry Elder said and I quote ""Will Smith is like the Barry Manilow of rap"". Ok, he made it into acting...better stick with that ( and his acting isn't even that good ). He sure did mess up that Ali movie, Ali suppose to be a legend. They should have gotten Jamie Fox."
2,The Fresh Prince Should Retire,"We all loved Will Smith as the Fresh Prince, but isn't it time he call it quits? The man is in his 30's still actin like he's 19. And what is up with that video ""Switch""? It looks like a hip-hop ho-down! I think Will Smith is extremely talented and needs to focus his energy elsewhere, because right now it looks like he's having a mid-life crisis. I hate it when celebrities get bored and start churning out bad albums to us...JUST LET IT GO! Jay-Z knew when to retire, why can't Will?"
5,The Fresh Prince is back!,"Will Smith comes back to hip-hop after a brief period of being out of the game. This is real hip-hop even if everyone thinks that if he doesn't curse its not good.This is a great cd with only one bad song and it isn't even that bad(R&B remix of Switch).He raps about things that he's experienced and things that actually mean something to him.Im not saying that when 50 cent raps about his money and cars and stuff that it doesn't mean something to him but honestly who can't rap about that stuff and who really cares?His lyrics are very good and the beats provided mostly by the Freshman fit Will perfectly.Best songs are I wish I made that,Party Starter and Lost&Found. Really every song on here could be the best song on most hip-hop cds out their but i only picked 3 to pick out.Go buy this album dont get the bootleg or download!"
4,Cathartic and passionate,"This album really caught me by surprise. I was first drawn to it because I love the rhythmic beat in ""Switch"", and loved the video. Expecting mainly dance tracks, I was surprised when I started hearing Will's lyrics about politics, religion and, essentially, the state of humankind. This album is incredible. I couldn't agree more with what he is saying, and I love hearing him bare his emotions and get angry in some of the songs. ""Holy Roller"" reflects my exact views on organized religion, and, in fact, he has very insightful messages in all of his songs. This is a refreshing, impressive, *honest* album."
5,Big Willie's back!!!,"This album is the bomb!!! Big Willie is back and better than ever. You guys have to buy it and make Lost & Found go double platnimum. He's real, nice and has a good flo and finally goes at all those who've dissed him over the years. This album's beats are tight and lifted by appearances such as Mary J. Blidge."
1,Why do you bother Will?,"After listening to this sad album I remember just sitting there and realizing that hip hop is truly dead and has left one smelly corpse. FIrst off Will's beats sound like one of Jerry's kids trying to sound like Timbaland, they are plain annoying. Will's lyrics are straight first grade rhymes, my little sister sounds like big daddy kane compared to him and all her rhymes are about mary and her little lamb.This is truly an album for soccer moms to play for their kids when trying to put them to sleep in their mini vans. Sad, sad, sad."
1,Stop Playing,"This ishhh is horrible!!! Will Smith needs to stop playing and stick to acting. I can't believe he put his self out there like that. This music isn't worthy of downloading, let alone buying.Save your money, don't buy this garbage!"
1,AMAZING!!!,"I can't believe it! Will Smith's latest record is amazing! I can hardly believe how amazingly strong his songwriting has become! He's truly an amazing composer, musician, and lyricist. I think he also plays every single instrument on this record!! Even the album cover is of interest! The photo of Will Smith standing on the corner of West Philly and Hollywood is incredibly poignent and should clear up any talk about him sinply becoming a 'sell-out'. I'm happy to contribute my $13 to the Big Willie fund, I hear that all of the proceeds are going towards cancer research."
2,Lost in acting Found in....hell naw,Its fools like this that are making real artists opressed. He didnt get any chance in any film anymore so he just though toh well I still have music. Since he is mister Smith he gets the best beats right any beat maker wanna stand next to this mainstream pothead. The person that made the beats needs to get em to a real rapper not someone who sounds like they are practising a normal conversation. he has no flow. This cd reminds me of viagra he just thought he got older a comeback and bader like a old dude with viagra. somebody throw this fool of stage seriously when i listened to it i only enjoyed the beats i developed a automatic block to his voice. Dont buy it unless you like mainstream stupid lyrical msuic like laffy taffy or lil Jon. sorry smith retire two way u got enough money to spare a nation from eartorture!
4,Better than the last two albums,"I really enjoyed this album very much, its better than the last one he made. There are only some songs on this album that I really didn't enjoy too much, but the rest is not bad. My favorite song from this album is Lost & Found, which talks about today's rap and how its all the same. Another good song is Could You Love Me, which reminds me of 50cents 21 questions. This album may not be the greatess, but its good enough for purchase."
4,"Good album, not perfect","After a brief hiatus in his rap career, Big Willie comes back with a bang in ""Lost and Found."" Will keeps doing what he does best: writing addictive dance-style rap without the excessive topics talked about by rap artists today. Some of the album has filler, but some of it is great. ""Switch"" is an awesome dance song, ""Pump Ya Brakes"" is cool to see Snoop Dogg and Smith combining talents, ""Ms. Holy Roller"" is Will Smith taking the other side rarely taken in the religion debate, almost a counterpoint to Kanye West's ""Jesus Walks"" (and I have to say that I agree with Willie 100%), ""If You Can't Dance"" is plain hilarious, and recalls the days of DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, while ""Mr. Niceguy"" is Smiths ""ode"" to the haters of his music. Fans from age 5 to 95 can listen to this album and enjoy it, so pick it up today!"
5,One of the best album he's made!,"Another superb album from will Smith.All of the songs on the album are top quality it's NOT one of those albums you have to grow into i loved each song the first day i got it and i couldn't stop.The best song on the album has to be ""Tell me Why"" with Mary j Blidge. Very meaning full indeed.So buy it!!"
1,A waste of money!,This toy was a total waste of money. Worked a very short time before it started eating tapes. Batteries are hard to fit in also. A waste!
4,Excellent toy for a musical 2 year old,"I bought this for a young 2 year old who loves to dance and she is beginning to get the hang of the microphones (at first she thought they were telephones). My only regret is that there are not many tape cassettes of songs etc. out there anymore to buy, so they have to be recorded."
1,Ate tape within five minutes of use,"I purchased this cassette recorder for my daughter's third birthday. She was excited by how colorful it was and the microphones. While she unwrapped her other gifts I placed the batteries in what should have been a screwed on compartment for the age range of the item. I placed the tape in and within five minutes of the tape playing it ate the tape. We could not get the tape out at all so I am returning this item, especially after reading a review with the same problem. I was trying to save money by purchasing this item and I guess I got what I paid for."
2,Constantly Tipping Over,"The product is very durable. That's a good thing since it has an incredibly poorly designed base that causes the recorder to tip forward with the slightest shake or bump. The recorder sits on a tripod of legs - two out the side and one in the back that allows it to lean back a little. But it does not lean back far enough and is very front heavy, so it tips forward very easily. If you leave it on a shelf or piece of furniture, you will find it lying on the floor with the battery compartment popped open and batteries all over the place. And never put it up somewhere where it will fall on your child as it will cause injury.My advice to potential buyers - buy something else. My advice to Little Tikes - try actually testing your products before putting them on the market."
1,Do not buy this piece of junk,"I wanted a tape player that my son could use to listen to music and sing along into the microphone. His voice comes out so quietly you can't even hear it. It won't stand up on it's own, so you have to lay it down on the ground to use it. We were just listening to a tape on it and it suddenly stopped working. We've only used it a few times since it's such a bother. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Do not buy this product!,"My daughter and I played with this toy for only half an hour before it started destroying all of her tapes. She is very gentle, and handled the tape player very carefully. I managed to salvage her favorite tapes, but the tape player is beyond repair. What a rip off!"
1,Waste of Money!!!,"I bought 1, and after 1 or 2 days it broke and I returned for replacement. The replacement broke in the exact same way as the original. With this problem, this item should be pulled from being sold. Don't waste your money or time on this one!"
1,Not worth a dime.... terrible...don't waste your money,"We bought this for my son thinking it would be fun for him to pretend with the microphone and we can make little recordings of him etc. What a waste of money - it doesn't even work. Yes, you can play the tape that comes with it but that isn't what we bought it for, if we were interested in that we would have bought a regular tape player. The microphone is the PITS! It could never pick up my sons voice or even my voice for that matter, you have to speak directly into one particular spot on the microphone and then at best it plays back as a barely audible muffled sound, SO dissapointing! We thought the one we bought was broken so we returned it and got another, same exact problems. Junk!"
1,Stay Away From This Product!,"Immediately, one of the microphones lost it's cap, DC converter I purchased will not run it, batteries do not fit in compartment correctly, and although it worked seemingly fine for about 3 days, it now is eating tapes like my three year old goes after cupcakes and the rewind button is having issues with staying on it's sharp metal post! I am sending this back first thing tommorow and going on a new mission seeking a new WELL MADE unit. Very disappointed. Shame on Little Tykes for selling such an inferior product...Amazon, pull this off your shelves, it is junk and I know you think better of your customers than that."
2,Great concept- Poor design,"We purchased this cassette recorder for our two little girls. They had so much fun with it the first few days, though it kept tipping over. When a cassette tape was inside it was heavy in the front and kept falling down. That was alright, we just laid it down on the speaker to play. It was dropped and the battery door fell off. Then just by lifting the recorder the battery door would fall off. So I went to get some tape to secure the battery door when I noticed one of the springs that holds in the battery (and supplies current) was missing. So the recorder after 4 days did not work. If the spring had not falled out it would have needed tape to keep it functional. Not a very good quality toy. I would suggest another brand."
1,Don't waste your money,While my two and a half year old loved this item it is not a quality little tikes toy. After just a month with an adult using it the toy ate the tape. When I called to have the tape replaced I was directed to a company in association with Little tikes to get the replacement part. They want a letter sent to the corporate office in order to receive the tape. I was also told to return the product and not use it. Don't waste your money. This is not a quality Little tikes toy. Shame of it all is my son loved singing into the microphone.
2,Weak for a little tike,"I bought this toy for my son, who is younger than the 3+ age requirement, but is smart enough to run a leap pad so surely he can run a tape player. My largest complaint is that for a children's toy it should be able to handle a few knocks. Within 5 minutes of my putting in the new shinny batteries, the tape player fell over (it does not stand well because of its base) and all the batteries fell out as well as the tape. My son did love the microphone, but you practically have to eat it to get it to pick up your voice. Also, this may be a battery saving device, but the micrphone wouldn't work unless a tape was playing. The directions said you could use the microphone by ""turning it on"" without a tape, but ours apparently did not have that feature.Overall, I think that since all children (and adults from time to time) drop things, a toy's battery section should be screwed on. What is the point of giving a child a toy if every 10 minutes he needs the batteries reloaded."
1,It ate the tapes,"My daughter got this as a gift and absolutely loved it! She loved having her own music and signing into the microphones! She was only able to use it a few times though. It kept eating tapes. I was able to remove most of them, but then while she had a brand new tape in it ate it so bad that I could not get it out. I was very disappointed and so was she. I was able to return the player but was not refunded for all the tapes that got destroyed."
3,Criticism Criticized,"""An Experiment in Criticism"" is a stretching book. Stemming from his ""day jobs"" at Oxford and Cambridge, Lewis' essay turns literary criticism on its head. He proposes that, rather than analyze what a given book seems to be saying, we analyze why we read a book. The whole is an interesting venture into reading books with open minds, but may prove obtuse to the casual reader. Only recommended for the serious student of literature."
5,Best Book on Reading Books,"This is the best book I've ever seen on reading books. Lewis does not judge books but readers here. He breaks us down into the literary and non literary. It's fun to see which category one fits in via his thoughts on the matter. If you bother to read this book at all then you surely fall into the former; the latter wouldn't bother with a work like this.Lewis teaches us the difference between ""using"" art and ""receiving"" it. He bids us to get lost in books and fully enter the world of the writer. And in the Epilogue he gives the best defense for reading fiction that I've ever seen (this goes for his thoughts on reading Myth as well).This is also a great book if you're trying to improve your writing and story-telling.I read this book twice, took lots of notes, and can honestly say it has not only made a difference, but will continue to do so."
5,One of the Best...,"Well-worth your time! Yes, Lewis is elitist, and yes, he creates a binary of sorts between the many and the few. However... talk about a fresh look at reader-response criticism!Lewis argues that the best readers do not ""use"" texts to write their own stories within. Rather, the best readers are those who ""receive"" the text. In an era where ideology threatens literature and authors, Lewis offers a more noble route.This book changed the way I read. And its not too long. =)"
4,Westminster Study,"For the serious student of the Westminster Confession of Faith (WCF),this book probably tops them all. The author depicts the content secion by section of the Confession, follows each section with a commentary, and then a series of questions on the section. The answers are found in the back.The downside of the book is whether one agrees with the position as held by the Puritans who created the WCF. For instance, their belief as held by the author that the Sabbath was changed by Christ to Sunday (Calvin held a different view), and whether there are only 2 covenants found in the Bible that we be concerned with. As I am still reading the book, I suspect to find other points of contention. The Author is a noteable member of the Orthodox Presbyterian church and follows their theoogical beliefs."
3,If they'd just fix the little things!,"System works well...except it's lacking in design. It's too easy to knock the handset off-hook by accident; no beep to alert messages are waiting; hand set and remote phones are not comfortable to cradle.Most annoying of all is that if there is a power outage, it loses it's programming! The clock resets, messages get deleted, your pin number to access messages remotely goes! How complicated is it to have a battery backup? A unit at this price should have been thought out and engineered better!"
3,Good Base Unit - very bad hand set,Got this phone - yes the base unit is a very good unit and work very well. However the hand set is bad. The hand set stops working - the battery requires constant charging
2,Old Technology,"This phone just arrived to the US market, however i owned this phone back in 1995 and again in europe a few months ago.Having said this, the phone has a ton of features, however very few are useful in a household, unless you have a very big house, otherwise the features are more useful in a business environment.I do not reccomend this phone, there are far better products out there which are a lot more user friendly. Unless you are ready to memorize the instructions book, this phone is probably not for you."
1,Defective LCDs,"I originally purchased a 2415 a few years ago, but for some reason it was not compatible with Verizon Caller ID. Siemens thought they were doing me a favor by upgrading me to the 2420. They weren't. I didn't need the 2 line feature, but I did like thephone and the other features. It would be a good system, but for one major problem. The LCDs on these phones are prone to failure. Without a readable LCD, you cannot use many of the phone's features. I replaced the original phone after about 2 years with a refurbished model I bought off eBay, because the LCD on the first phone became totally unreadable. Now after about 2 more years the replacement phone's LCD is failing."
2,Poor Performer,"We bought this phone when it first came out two years ago. This phone is fine as long as you are near the base station. Our home is 4000 sq ft on one floor, and if we are one room too far away, the phone squeals, and drops the call. The phones are stylish, but all the handsets have all been repaired under warranty at least once. Pretty phones, poor performance. Maybe the latest models have fixed the problems, but I doubt it. Make sure to get the extended warranty, or you will asset dispose these Siemens Gigasets to the ...."
1,Don't think about it,"The handset sounds great. That's as far as I can go. I bought the base system and three additional handsets for our two story home. It is convenient to have these phones in each room, but the sound quality is absolutely terrible for the people on the far end. Every conversation we have someone mentions the ""popping"" that they hear. I wish I could return these, but I waited too long."
1,The great disconnect,"I would not recommend this or any Siemens product to anyone.I have had this phone for less then 1 year, back in June the phone began disconnecting any call that I was on when call waiting was activated. I have contacted Siemens several times via email to get a fix for the phone, but they will not respond to me. I have called and have been told that I've called the wrong division and to call another number, only to be told that I have called the wrong number. This is not good customer service."
2,"Great features, poor quality","The feature set of this phone is outstanding and easy to use. However, the build quality of the phone is absolutely poor - these phones keep dying after a few months of usage."
1,"Run away, run away","I bought one of these with two remote phones.It constantly goes into a mode where communicationsounds like you are underwater. Plus the range isabout 100 feet, not 700 as advertised.Run away, buy something else...."
1,Don't buy Siemens!!!,"I have struggled with this product for over a year now, and just recently the whole system stopped to function.The idea of having a two-line phone system with cordless handsets is great. The execution by Siemens is less than great. I bought this system with 3 handsets, of which I have had to change all three due to the fact that they just stopped working. One day, their screens would be lighting up intermittently and no communication possible between the handsets or between the handsets and the base station.It seems Siemens doesn't really care about making products that work. Contacting them through their website is a hassle, and it is really hard to find any useful info there.I would rather use my money buying some other brand, even if that means the equipment is more expensive. At least there might be a hope that the equipment works."
1,Overpriced piece of garbage,"...I can throw a rock farther than the range the 2420 cordless unit provides. When ""in range"" theres more static than a 1940's ham radio receiver. Batteries on cordless drain rapidly. Like the base unite though..."
2,Only base unit functions well,"I have had the unit for a year, with two additional handsets. While the base unit functions well, within a few months the sound in both cordless handsets started to cut in and out, making it impossible - or at least highly irritating - to follow a conversation, especially for the other party. Siemens were not able to fix the problem, nor were they particularly helpful. Having now seen that others have had the same problem, I am looking for a different make and model."
4,Ok for a short time ...,"We have owned this with three handsets for just under two years. Within the first year, two of the handsets just literally died, and were replaced by Siemens. A few days after the year warranty expired, the third handset started to cut in and out, making conversation impossible. Now, 22 months on, the base station has started to act strangely, making it useless as an answering machine, call logger, etc. The dialling out bit is OK, but is that why we paid $$$ for it?!Overall, I'm happy the way they function, but not happy with the lifespan."
1,High Cost for Poor Quality Product! Don't Buy Siemens,"I bought the 2420 with desk station and handset. First thing to fail was the handset where the display and then the number 4 on the keypad gave out. This of course was just after the warranty period ended. Next the desk station LCD display stopped working and there is no way to repair it. Without the display working there is no way to program the phone. I need to be able to turn off the answering machine mode (because I use Vonage voicemail) and cannot do it. There is no flow chart in the manual that would show me the button pushing steps to accompish what I need to do. So I am throwing this expensive piece of sh*t away. I will never buy a Siemens telecom product again. The default on the phone is answering machine on, so there is no way to reset it (unplug it) and have the answering maching function turn off."
1,Siemens 2420 expandable set,Not a good product. Two of 6 telephones have expired and reception on others is spotty. Dificult to navigate system. Would not recommend product
2,Not Ready for Prime Time,"I had high hopes for this phone system, but they were dashed after about a week's worth of using it. The sound clarity is outstanding, but that's about the only commendable feature of this phone system. Some serious problems include: call waiting tones over-writing voice mail messages. The use of the number ""6"" both for retrieving and deleting messages - which means you'll accidently delete a lot of messages you haven't heard yet. No way to transfer directories between base and handsets, so you'll re-enter lists of names for each phone. The list goes on.... this is most certainly not up to Siemens quality standards!"
2,Not a very good unit,"Unfortunately, I'd have to agree with everyone else-- I was not impressed with this unit at all. It has a poor interface and picked up tons of interference from my microwave and 802.11b (Wi-Fi) network router. (I point this out becauase the phone I replaced it with [more on that in a minute] had no problems with interference.) The worst problem was the face that it would ""own"" a phone line when it connected: if I was on Line1 on the main base, nobody on any extension could join me on Line1. So it was impossible to do conference calls with others in the house. Also, the extension handsets are shoddy and poorly-manufactured; the buttons were hard to press and non-responsive.I replaced the entire unit with a Panasonic KX-TG2740, which has a very similar featureset but actually works well. :-) More about the TG2740 on my review over there..."
1,Disposable ... unit - No factory service if it fails,"Do not buy it, unless you buy a good extended warranty from the seller. The manufacturer warranty expires in one year and if the phone fails after that there is no factory service, and you would need to throw it away. I bought it in December 2000 and I had to return it twice within warranty period for malfunctioning; at 18 months after purchase, it failed again and Siemens told me that those are not repairable, that I have to buy a new one. Will not be a Siemens unit for sure."
2,Nice idea,"As a Gigaset owner for 2.5 years now, I have to say the concept itself is great, but the Siemens' implementation leaves much to be desired. The most notable problems are: (1) The range is significantly worse than a 900mhz Sony (and Siemens' tech support says it is normal), (2) The quality of the handsets is dismal, not nearly as robust as other cordless phones, (3) some features are missing or poorly designed. My advice regarding this phone is to wait until another manufacturer makes a similar model and Siemens feels the heat of some competition. I will note that two friends have the same phone and complain about the same problems."
2,Initially great-currently disappointing,"As others have stated, out of the box this phone system was great. I experienced superior sound quality and acceptable range (no problems inside or outside 4 bedroom colonial on .75 acres). After 2 years of use most of the handsets have developed an annoying garbled interference that begins shortly after using the phone. This makes it impossible to talk and leaves you scrambling for another phone. Siemens support has been disappointing. I have 4 handsets and only one works correctly. Despite my initial enthusiasm with the system-I will not buy another Siemens product."
2,"Started out GOOD, then went from BAD to UGLY","I used the Siemens 2420 with 8 handsets for 3 years. It has great features, but has had some reliability problems which ultimately proved fatal for this phone.THE GOOD: Easy call transfer, intercom, caller ID log and answering machine. Sleek appearance.THE BAD: Very limited range - I had to locate the base in the middle of the house for the handset in the far corner room to work. Generally susceptible to interference. After a couple of years, one of the handsets refused to hold a charge even after the batteries were replaced. After 2.5 years, one handset also started generating pulsing static noises on most calls, making it unusable.THE UGLY: The base station allows outgoing calls, but locks up on about 50% of the incoming calls. The LCD lights up every pixel and resets the entire system, with no way to answer or identify the incoming call.I finally decided to scrap the system and replace it with a Panasonic - hopefully that will be more reliable."
1,Product Does Not Work,"In mid-2000 I purchased two base units (with a total of 8 hand sets)for the Sieman's 2.4 GHz system, and I have found the system to be a major disappointment! Incoming calls are regularly dropped or cut-off; calls are often ""garbled"" (even when the phone is as close as 5 feet to the base unit); the ""range"" is no more than 60 feet; and a transfer of a call often results in it being dropped. Add to this non-existent customer service and you have a formula for a very unhappy customer. Would anyone be interested in buying a used system?! I strongly recommend that you avoid this (and any other) product from Seimens. It deserves a ""no-star"" rating."
2,Save your Money ! !,"The base station worked and it had many of the features I was looking for in a home/office environment but the quality is just not there. The handsets have the most limited range of any cordless I have ever used and Siemens has the WORST customer service anyone could imagine. The only way there could be any truth in the specs/ads would be the wording ""shown and sold as-is and where-is"". ie junk you will be wasting your hard earned money on. Buy Panasonic or Sony."
1,Don't waste the money,"I have to wonder what ""PC Computing"" was thinking giving this phone its MVP award. I can say I won't be relying on their reviews in the future! The main problems:1. The range is terrible (1/20 the distance of a Sony in our house),2. The handsets feel cheap and tend to break easily3. The buttons on the handsets give continuous problems, the display on one flickers in and out4. Siemens DOES NOT CARE. We initially called about the range and they said there was nothing that they could do. Then calling about handset problems was met with a 'so' even though they were not that old.In short, the ideas and the concept are good, but the implementation is terrible..."
1,12 months and you're out of luck.,"The phones are great. The most functional and best sounding cordless phone and system I have owned or used. One problem though--Siemens will not repair them out of warranty. Siemens will replace then in-warranty but will not touch them out-of-warranty. I developed a bad LCD on the base unit after 18 months. Siemens will not touch it nor will they provide any place to have it repaired. Their suggestion was to go on eBay and buy another. For this reason, I will not purchase any more Siemens phones."
1,Not what it's supposed to be,"If you use this phone system in a small space with no walls, you might love it. but put it into a normal office or home setting and it sounds like you're under water.Anything more than 50-feet, or if the signal has to go through two walls, forget it! It is almost not usable.I would rate is ""0"" if that were available."
1,Not very good,"All in all I've been very disappointed with this phone as have two friends who bought it at the same time. The range is less than my 900mhz Sony, the handsets are not very reliable and it is very difficult if even possible (haven't done it yet!) to get messages over the handset. The idea is good, but Siemen's implementation is not. Too bad because it has potential."
1,So much promise so much disappointment,"This phone system couldn't clearly communicate to a hand unit more than ten feet away. Any wall in my 90 year old home was too much for the system. I did find the functions relatively easy to use but there were annoying quirks as to how to release a line when switching to another, the LED is not backlit, and the handset on the base is fuctionally stupid although good looking. These are among many other small problems. Overall the biggest problem is the handheld units did not work which is why you would buy this system."
2,Can be much more,"This system is not the most user friendly system out there. The user manual is not very user friendly and has too many unsaid instructions. First I brought a recondition system, it did not last very long (three months) before it stop functioning, I then brought a new system expecting much better service. I have return all of my handsets for replacements for nonfunctioning reasons. The customer service people are very good and will send you another replacement when you are not satisfied with the system. Have a colorful day.Bernard Stringer"
2,Big Disappointment,When I purchased this unit it worked great. As time went bye the reception of the mobile units deteriorated. Everything Siemens support suggested failed to improve the situation. 18 months later I am junking the phone system and reverting back to a multiline corded system. My suggestion don't repeat my mistake.
1,"Bad phone, worse service and support!","Not even useable as a boat anchor. If you come across one of these phones, pick it up and throw it as far as you can. This will produce more gratifying results than any wasted phone calls to Siemens. Text on display looks like alien gibberish. One handset burned itself up and never really took a charge right, even with a new battery. Always plagued with background noise, warbles, and pops during calls. Siemen's advice? ""Did you try rebooting it?"" and ""It's broken. We suggest you buy the newer, more expensive one."" I'm amazed that it ever passed FCC or UL tests."
4,what is 2.4,"All the reviewers of this phone who know what a frequency of a phone is please raise your hands. Before purchasing this product I read all of the reviews about how bad the range is. Having technical experiance I knew before hand that the word 2.4 ghz printed on the phone does not refer to the range of the product. Because another phone has 900mhz printed on it and this has 2.4ghz on it doesnt mean it will go farther, it just the frequency it uses. Knowing this before buying the product will keep you from making a common mistake. No where in the box or manual does it say this phone was designed for range. I have been very pleased with this product which has more features than I could use. I wasnt suprised that the phone was menu driven given the size of the phone how else can all the features be accessed. Overall this is a great phone with almost everything you need."
1,Don't waste your time if you need any distance,I'm returning this because I can't get the handsets to work from more than 15 feet from the base station. I called Siemens and they said that the phone was notorius for only working in short distance situations. I have a regular stud and sheetrock house and it won't work while going through a single wall. They should warn you about this. This unit was a tremendous wast of time for me.
2,DItto; opened up handset - disturbing gell found,"Ok, so our handsets have been getting flaky.the buttons stopped working.I opened it up.There is some odd clear sticky gel everywhere, and the circuit board is discolored.this is not battery goop, either. this is something else. I suspect either whatever was in the rubbery buttons OR whatever was in the contact layer for the switches.I am now shopping for a replacement. I do need the dual line, multiple handset features, and would like some kind of battery backup. any advise?"
1,"Garbled sound, piece of junk, avoid Siemens",This phone is junk. I spent way too much money buying handsets and base units. Sound is garbled on handsets. Range is minimal. Base unit disconnects callers. Tech support completely useless. I wouldn't buy anything from this company.
1,Handset is useless,Base station is ok but the handset is useless. We tossed it in the trash after fighting it for a year. Range is less than 10 feet. I would not use another phone from this company if it were FREE.
3,Pity.,"What I liked. Great Speaker Phone. Fantastic feature set. What I disliked. For all the 2.4GHz Hype, the quality in my 1200sq ft newly constructed (read: 90% drywall) apartment is not good. (Inferior to my 900MHz) But the 2 most irritating things I found were a 22 digit limit on Speed Dial numbers. Awful Awful Awful. Because the Pause Key seems very short (The (information rich, but poorly indexed) manual does not say how long a pause is) I had to waste 7 of my 22 digits on pauses to check my voice mail at the office.. Cant program in some international numbers if preceeded with the 1010 number of your choice. Finally, power blips reset the clock, but not the stored numbers. Weird."
1,Beware - poor comm quality,Very disappointed - the system has poor quality when you are more than 10 feet or so away from the base system - lots of poping noises and sounds like a cell phone with a bad digital connection. I'm not alone - a friend just replaced his brand new system with a Panasonic due to the same issues.
2,I regret purchasing this phone,"It has been only 1.5 year or so but the keypad is occasionally unresponsive and I have to try really hard to dial a number. The handset must be kept at the charging unit otherwise unlike many phones, it discharges in hours."
3,did not last...,This was a great phone for about 5 months. First the display went out and then the battery would not charge... For the money I had expected more! Costumer support is hard to come by! So I can only give this product 3 stars!
3,hand sets die young,"We were pleased with the 2420 and 5 handsets for about 3 months. Our most used handset development problems with the keypad; some numbers worked, others didn't. 2+ years later all handsets have weird problems. I'm actively looking for a new system.Several friends have the 2420 and have experienced handset failure as well."
1,Battery Drains Way Too Fast!,"I like this phone for many reasons....but i am so sick of the phone dying on me! Every single day I hear the warning beep that my phone is about to die. It is so irritating....that if I didn't buy this phone 10 months ago....i would have returned it. There are some things that could have been made better on this phone...although, i do love many of the features. Its not very stylish either, but some of there newer models look pretty nice. The sound quality has been poor at times....there is static at times...and always when my microwave is on. But now my problem is with the battery...every day ""beep, beep, beep...flatline!"""
4,Incredible Library of Sounds,"Tired of the loops that came with your basic Acid product? There are hundreds of new loops to explore on this CD that will kick up the power of any Acid program. The loops on this CD are great for a housed-up track, my personal favorite. While the number of new loops is astounding, I think the price is way too high. I think Sonic Foundry would sell a lot more at a more attractive price. That is why I deducted the star. Other than that, this adds hours of fun and creative power to your Acid program of choice."
3,NOT HER BEST,"I must sympathize with the previous reader's comments, but having read Rendell/Vine's most recent novels I can't be as harsh. King Solomon's Carpet is barely worthy of the mystery genre (a crime does occur - 75 pages before the end of the book!) and is more of a character study of a motley group of subway musicians and their relatives. I persevered though and made it to the end. No surprises though. The terrorist element is fairly obvious to guess. Not one of her best and not one I would recommend. No Night is Too Long and Anna's Book are far more engrossing and suspenseful. I'm anxious to start The Chimney's Sweeper's Boy - her latest."
5,Too Weird for Words!,"If anyone said they were going to write a novel about the British Underground railway or tube, evryone would think - who would want to read it? Well, Ruth Rendall (or Barbara Vine in this case) has done just that with this book, and she's done her usual awesome job! This book is totally weird and wonderful, in true Barbara Vine fashion. The tension builds throughout the book, until about halfway through, I was waiting for something dreadful to happen. And indeed it did. As a word of warning - if this is your first Barbara Vine book, you must read through until the end because stuff keeps happening right until then. The thing I really like about Barbara Vine books are her characters. They are all so weird and wonderful, and catastrophic stuff seems to happen to each of them when they finally meet up with each other."
2,Disappointing,"Although I felt driven by the plot to read through to the end, I was disappointed with the overall mood and characters. Each character was well developed but none were likable except the villain, who I found myself rooting for."
2,Mediocre,"""King Solomon's Carpet"" begins Barbara Vine's slide into mediocrity. With the exceptions, perhaps, of ""Gallowglass"" and ""The Brimstone Wedding"" she has been unable to maintain the elegant mix of structure, character, and mood she created in ""A Dark Adapted Eye"", ""A Fatal Inversion"", and ""The House of Stairs"". The characters here are one-dimensional and the plot ""twists"" are so obvious and well anticipated that they leave you saying to yourself ""I knew that!"" and ""It's about time!"" If you are a diehard Rendell/Vine fanatic you will probably like this book; however, if you want something more than a run-of-the-mill suspense novel (which is what you expect from Barbara Vine), indeed if you want some suspense, this book is not for you."
1,Difficult,"My first Barbara Vine book, and definitely the last. I persevered through about 2 thirds of the book and never once understood what was going on. Several little episodes failed to capture my attention or imagination, and I'm afraid I just couldn't face the struggle through the remainder - maybe that would have brought some meaning to the book, but by then, I just didn't care."
2,It broke the first time I used it,I was using it for the first time by applying all the force I can with my hands and the ring side broke.The only reason I do not give it less then 2 stars is that I have seen worse.a good wrench should not brake even if extra lever torque is applied on it.
5,Excellent,"This is a no nonsense handbook for the System Administrator and novice as well. A good basic understanding of UNIX is required, but references to commands are right at your fingertips. Thank you Frank... now write one for HP-UX"
4,Good For a Ceremony,I think that this CD is very good for you wedding ceremony. However it is quite short.
4,Great Cd,"The cd definetely has its good moments. A great Cd all-around, great for dancing too and just jamming out."
1,EL MUNDO ESTA LOCO...,"SI ELLOS TIENEN TALENTO, ENTONCES VIVIMOS EN UN PLANETA DE LOCOS. QUE TITO NO SE HA ESCUCHADO A SI MISMO LO DESASTROSA E IRRITANTE QUE SUENA SU VOZ??? LAS LEYES DEBERIAN SER SEVERAS Y PROHIBIRLE GRABAR UN DISCO MAS."
1,Daddy Yankee se jode a este grupo,"A mi no me gusta escuchar a hector y tito porque es bien pervertido. Y la musica no se como nos puede gustar muchos jovenes, musica tan simple. Si quieres escuchar buen reggaeton escuches a Daddy Yankee y Playero 41."
2,Poor Quality Control,"The quality of this DVD is poor. The DVD ""froze"" during the last ten minutes of the movie. (This happened upon an initial purchase, but also with the subsequent replacement purchase.) Obviously, poor manufacturing and quality control."
2,Confusion Fits the Film Perfectly,"I can understand the mix of reviews for this film. It could have easily been titled ""Confused People"". It's rather dark and ugly story, and if you like to connect with at least one character, you'll be hard-pressed to do it in the movie. If anyone, I felt sorry for Christophe, the young man who would have done anything for Alain, except Alain was incapable of commitment and coming to terms with his sexuality. While the story line is a common theme, I found the film at times slow and disconnected. Although I cared less for most of the characters, the acting itself was good. Nothing outstanding from the standpoint of cinematography. I see it's listed as a ""romantic satire"" - don't be fooled. What I recall most from the film is how a series of people with apparent low self-worth chase about the confused and disrespecting Alain. if this theme catches your fancy for 90 minutes, have at it. It's twisted, dark, and definitely focused on confused people."
2,Confusion,"This is what the film is. Even the cover may confuse as the boy pictured on it, appears for 20 sec and brings nothing to the story...The main character isn't likable at all, the plot drags. I didn't find anything ""entertaining"" in this film. It almost made me fall asleep. Second star for acting.In general - failure."
4,"Surprising, witty gem","Alternately oh-so-serious and laugh-out-loud funny, this one is a delight from beginning to end. It's rare that a film featuring a cadre of unlikable dolts (save adorable Christophe) comes off this well. Terrific character study of the messed-up and silly bourgeuois"
3,It seemed longer than it was.,"I enjoyed it. I thought it was well acted and directed. It just seemed long. There was a lot going on at one point. There were several plots intertwined with the main story, very interesting possibilities.It is worth a rental."
5,Great Cd,"I love this cd cause listening to it took back to when I was in my early 20's and if you want to feel young again put this on and you will, for the peoples who are in their 40-50 to feel young again."
1,Sloppy editing--typos all over!,"I don't know how all the mistakes in this book got past the editors. It is more than just careless typos. There are numerous inconsitancies between the CSS examples given and the web page results. Only as far as the second chapter, I've lost count of the inconsistancies--enough to make me give up on the book. I've checked out the companion web site, and the corrections are not to be found. The poor quality of the book also shakes my faith in Peachpit Press's Visual Quickstart series, which up until now I have enjoyed using."
5,Excellent!,"This is a great reference book, it gets into how to actually do things you're going to want to do. Each CSS facility is described, an example is provided, and has a quick-reading chart showing which browsers it is, or not, compatible with.Then the author goes on with a wonderful introduction to DHTML, again in his understandable, informative way.An excellent book with great information you will keep as reference!"
2,More a manual than a book,"How much you like this book depends on what you want out of it. When I buy a book that touts ""teach yourself DHTML and CSS the quick and easy way"" on the cover, I expect something that's readable and has a series of lessons. What I got was more like a reference manual than a book. If that's what you're looking for, this certainly has a lot of details on how CSS works. But if you want an engaging series of lessons that are easy to read, compelling, and keep your attention -- that's what I wanted -- this fell short for me. Too many lists of commands surrounded by lifeless prose; too few sections that were actually interesting to read."
3,Not that great,Unimpressed with this book I was looking for much more of a CSS/DHTML reference. This guy beats around the bush until the cows come home with verbose explanations on very simple concepts.
2,Full of errors and typos,The editing and proofreading processes in publishing this book seem to have been bypassed altogether. This book is ripe with errors and typos that will confuse the unfortunate CSS neophyte. It appears to be another example of a web-development book that was rushed to press well before it was ready. I plan on returning the book for a refund.
1,typos everywhere,"I recently purchased this book and a few of the examples were not working. I spent hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong and then I decided to download the codes from the website. I then realized it wasn't my mistake at all, there were typos everywhere. on page 62, the print example, is one of those I could not get to work. When I compared the book example to the online code example I noticed they were very different. For a nooby like me, this was very frustrating because I spent hours on this one small example. And from reading the other reviews, it seems like it gets worse when he talks about DHTML."
4,good CSS intro,"I am experienced with HTML but not with CSS. I picked up some CSS from web sites, but I wanted a reference.I looked through this book and Eric Meyer's in the bookstore, and surprisingly I chose this one. It seemed to be more accessible, with a lot of examples that are very clearly displayed.I have been quite successful at adapting the examples. The author has included some helpful little features, such as a list of font families and which operating systems/browsers support them.So far, I've found one example that displays differently on my configuration than it does in the book. My guess is that I may find other ""mistakes"" as I go along.Frankly, I was not interested in DHTML when I bought this book, so I cannot review that aspect.Overall, I think that this is the best introduction to CSS that is available right now. I definitely can say that I got my money's worth out of it."
3,Hard to follow,"After reading Elizabeth Castro's HTML book I thought this would be a good next step. However, this book does not stack up anywhere as readable as Castro's book. The CSS part is OK, but the javascript part is poor with hard-to-follow examples using Alice in Wonderland images."
2,Lousy picks,"to me this cd could have been wayyyyyyyyyy better. who wants to hear themes like eugene or teddy long, when they can hear ortons, Edge, BATISTA's!!!!! evolution is good, the sd theme is good, christians theme is good. but it could have been way better."
2,What is so special about these Superstars?,"This CD was incredibly dissappointing and I should have refused to buy this album in the first place. The only interesting tracks were Motorhead - Line In The Sand, You Can't Run - Billy Kidman, and Gail Kim's theme - International Woman. Some themes included were absolutely pointless, such as Carlito Carribean Cool, who had hardly been on the WWE roster and had already bought himself a spot on a WWE disc. Heidenreich was another pointless theme of one of the WWE's most unpopular superstars. I'm sure A-Train had more charisma. The Raw Diva Search theme was pointless as I'm sure you can't rip that to an XBox for any reason. It is definitely known that the WWE had not released any music album for ages, but this was a miserable attempt. I would have prefered a few themes from departed superstars such as Goldberg, Test or Scott Steiner's WWE theme tune, which can't be found anywhere!"
2,"REALLY WANT GOOD WWE ALBUMES BUY VOLUMES 3,4, AND AGGRESION.","CANT BELIVE CHRISTAIN GOES OUT WITH THAT ONE NEW THEME SONG LIKED HIS OLD ONE BETTER. THE NEW CENA SONG IS BETTER. SEARIOUSLY THOUGH CHECK OUT THE WWF CD'S I LISTED ABOVE, THOSE WERE THE GOOD OLD DAYS."
2,Hellblazer's Review,The only great songs on the CD I would say is Evolution's theme Line in the sand. Also Billy Kidman's and the Smackdown theme. John Cena's song The Untouchable isn't is as great as the Basic thugonomics.
5,wwe fans {this may shock you },perfect music on the cd better than any thing i heared for a rap artist. my niehboor is john cena. 4 real. this is the bomb. i'm suprised that john cena has just invited me to dinner.
2,"2 Hit Wonder-Where's RKO, Lita, or Edge?","Like everyone else has written, Line In The Sand(Evolution) and Just Close Your Eyes(Christian) are the only 2 songs worth giving a damn on this cd. Randy Orton's theme, Lita's theme(the new version w/lyrics), and Edge's new song were the songs I mostly anticipated, only to be disappointed. Why did Victoria switch to this horrible hip-hop song? She should've stuck w/the russian lesbian club song(All The Thing She Said). They could've added an old skool WWE tune or two(I'm STILL waiting for them to release Dusty Rhode's ""Americana"" theme, Sherri Martel's version of ""Sexy Boy"", and The Rougeau Bros. ""All-American Boys""!!! Why werent they ever on the Anthology cd?)"
1,Mainly good for Taker's current theme,This is mainly good for Taker's current theme which is on the dvd.
4,WWE Theme Addict Review,"This CD was way better than the WWE Originals, I'm proud to say.Line in the Sand-Evolution: I sorta liked this one, being a Triple H fan, so yeah, its pretty good. Has that metalish sorta sound to it.Cool-Carlito:........I like Carlito, but this sounded so stupid. I like it only for laughs. Nice tropical beat. But nyah. not something I would dig into.Mac Militant-Teddy long: this song was awesome! I'm a rap fan so yeah, I loved it. Well, except for the guy who's rapping, but the overall beats and rhythms were good.Just Close your eyes-Christian: I'm a Christian fan, but not really for me. I just didn't like it.Dangerous Politics-Heidenreich: This song made me laugh a little. Heidenreich is funny. But this song...it was alright.others I liked:John CenaChavoUndertakerSheltonVictoriaRise upoverall cd was great. you should get it if your a fan."
4,Tosca,Wonderful sound. The performances are spectacular and the orchestra is stellar. I would recommend this Tosca for any fan from beginner to expert.
2,Low fidelity with Roady wireless FM modulator,The fidelity with the wireless FM modulator is poor. The unit is convenient if you don't mind a muffled sound (the high end is very poor or non-existant). I switched to the more cumbersome cassette adapter which improved the music quality significantly. Direct connect would be ideal however. The modulator was free with purchase but I got what I paid for.
1,Was okay when it worked!,"This was alright, except the power is so intermittent you have to leave your XM unit on...not great when the receiver gets so hot. Anyway, when it's powered off, it's difficult to get it back on. Wish there was a more reliable way to get Sat. radio to play through a standard GM in-dash CD player..."
2,Better than nothing,This is used with a Roady XM and it is a fair solution. Of course the best install is to hard wire. Second best is to use the cassette adapter. IN DISTANT THIRD PLACE IS THE DELPHI FM MODULATOR. It is cool that it is a custom accessory to the Roady but on long point to point trips you will be changing the frequency often as fringe stations easily overpower it. But for portability of the Roady between cars where no cassette is available - it will perform at an acceptable level.
5,These guys ARE going to be bigger than Pearl Jam,"As a radio DJ I have plenty opportunity to see many bands, none has impressed me as much, or kept me coming back, as much as pushmonkey. This is one of those great CD's like PJ's ""ten"" or Nirvana's ""unplugged"" that you do not once feel like skipping a song. Just buy the damn CD, you'll love it..."
3,"Interesting, catchy release from a Texas quintet","This band has its act together. On songs like ""Cut the Cord"" and ""Handslide,"" Pushmonkey has the ability to accompany pumping instrumentals with a cool set of vocals. The emphasis of backing vocals on all the tracks really ties everything together."
5,Incredible,Best Cd in my collection hands down.! EVERY song on the album is AMAZING.! I wish Pushmonkey was still together so I can experience them live.
3,Good band but keep getting bad CDs,This band is really good but unfortunately I keep getting bad CDs. I have over 100 cds and this is the first one that I have ever gotten that was bad. Maybe its just a bad batch and hopefully they are all gone but if you buy this cd make sure you try to play track 3 when you get it. The first cd I got wouldn't play it at all and on the second cd I could only play it on 1 out of 7 cd players.
5,Fantastic CD From Texas Band,"If you want to hear a CD where every tune is a potential Top Ten hit, Pushmonkey's self-titled major label debut is it! Texas bands have always had a fine tradition of writing great songs and sounding great--from ZZ Top to The Toadies & Pantera. Pushmonkey combines the powerhouse riffs of old Guns & Roses and KISS with the melodic vocals and likable lyrics of Tony Park. Park's vocals are tremendously catchy. The songs are all Grade A--""Lefty,"" ""No Dumb Wrong,"" and ""Cut The Cord,"" and lest I forget the radio hit ""Handslide."" Pushmonkey deserves a lot of praise for their music. Their first album, Maize, which was on Sector 2 was also great with the songs ""Crush It"" and ""Media Shark,"" but the odds of finding that album now are as good as winning the lottery."
5,Best thing to happen in music for a long time!,"This CD is only a taste of what these guys are capable of doing. Their hard-to-get first CD ""Maze"" paved the path for ""Pushmonkey"" and these guys never stop jamming! The beats get you moving and lead-singer Tony Parks' voice caresses your ears. It won't let you down when it comes to foreplay and what comes afterwards is a sure body pleaser. I know it has worked for me.This CD is a definite buy if you want a new sound, a mixture of hard-core jammin' with smooth, soft lyrics that make wanna jump up and dance. If you get a chance to see these guys live, what ever you do, DON'T PASS IT UP! I MEAN IT! This band is phenominal and there is no telling what they are going to come up with next. The buzz down here in Austin, Tx (P.M.'s main jammin' town)is that they are working on some more goodies for the next album. Keep your 'eye on the ball'!"
5,"Wonderful, been an avid fan for years","I've owned the game this music was made for, for years now and it never gets old. The contemporary theme of it's characters is a wonderful blend of piano, woodwinds and harp gives the music it's soul and leaves you with a longing feeling for more. I love these songs."
5,Best Grilling Spice Ever,"Perfect for steaks, ribs, even chicken. Hard to find in stores as they have reformulated it and it is not the same."
4,USEFUL,"It's a useful book for preparing TOEFL iBT, But it is unfortunate that the CD didn't have records for part III listening practices."
5,Rocking Blues at it's best!,"This is one of my favorite Rockin' Blues CD's. It has great guitar, soulful singing, and gets your toe's a tapping! Great covers of Frank Zappa and Percy Mayfield too. Don't pass this up."
2,Run Of The Mill Blues!,"There are plenty of average blues bands on the scene that produce fairly good quality, sometimes enjoyable CD's and then there is BackBone Slip. It is hard to find any redeeming quality about this disc. The cover's of JB Lenoir's ""Mama, Talk To Your Daughter"", Ray Charles ""A Fool For You"" and Jimmy Reed's ""Bright Lights, Big City"" are performed with absolutely no enthusiasm or feeling. You get the impression that these guys are merely going through the motions. The covers of Son Terry's ""Walk On"" and Joe William's ""Big Legged Woman"", while slightly better can only be described as mediocre. The CD includes two bonus songs only available on the CD, wow!. Those two songs are Frank Zappa's (that's right, Frank Zappa) ""Trouble Everyday"" and Percy Mayfield's ""Dangerzone"". both songs will make you wish you purchased the cassette. Blue Wave has a stable of talented musicians. Unfortunately, this group is not one of them. Two stars is being generous!"
5,Good all the time,Many years after it came out you can pop it in and still groove along. Awesome disc.
3,New Editions Blue Moon,"I'm gonna give them an A for effort, and a B- for actual. The remake of the Penguins' Earth Angel, and Little Anthony and the Imperials' Tears On My Pillow stand out to me as the 2 remakes that grabbed me the most off this album."
4,New Edition goes DooWop,New Edition does a great job of doing a remix of classic doowop style music. Excellent harmonies. I had the cassette from the day but added the cd recently.
3,The worst NE album if there ever was a bad one.,The album wasn't bad it was just thier worst album. All the songs are hot excpet Duke Of Earl.
3,bbd sings doo wop,"Aren't these the same cats who sang ""do me""? Yeah, I think so. Anyway, this cd with the embarrasing hair styles and artwork does have some good covers of old doo wop joints. These guys can't rap and aint thugs, but they can harmonize and stuff. These songs will take you way back if you old enuff, but if you new school you wont know whats up. BBD!!"
3,A good french read,"Andre Gide's Symphonie Pastorale was a wonderful book, but a hard read if you are not fluent in french. Many details are easily overlooked that are important to the book if you don't have perfected french reading skills. The book itself, was a wonderful and emotional tail that asked me questions I've never thought of before. But, sincerly, if you're not yet fluent in french, wait a year or two until you know french better to read this book. The symbolism and artful writing deserves is only effective if fully understood.√"
3,Would have enjoyed it more if it weren't for time-pressure,"This is a short French book, which I read to help my brother out with his homework. It is a first-person narrative with an adult pastor who finds a young blind girl and falls in love with her. She also shares his love, but when she meets his son, and she is given sight by a eye surgeon, things get a bit more complicated. It was a good read, but the fact that I had to read it quickly (and therefore had to curtail looking in the dictionary for words I didn't know), I probably didn't enjoy it as much as I could have."
5,hard to find item,Sportsmans guide seems to carry items that are hard to find anywhere else. They are good to do business with that is why i have a membership.
5,The Real Thing!,"I bought two pair of these gloves for a friend, as a Christmas present. She loves the fingerless gloves, but has a hard time finding a pair to match the ones she bought years ago. She has tried many brands, but none seemed to compare to the old ones that were softer, a better fit, and more flexible. I found these online and thought I'd give them a try. She was very happy to finally have what she called ""The Real Thing!"". She uses them all the time! I would highly recommend them."
3,Nice gloves,"Gloves arrived on time, did not realize they were wool, very itchy, they are worn over other gloves to prevent them from touching our skin,"
2,Scratchy wool,"I thought these were going to be very soft, but they were scratchy like rough twine. Looked great when wearing them."
4,Definitely worth it,"These gloves really do the job for me: keeping my hands warm on chilly days, while allowing me to still use my fingers for fine work. The wool is a bit scratchy, but other than that, i have no complaints."
4,great tv for the price,"Yes, if you are in the store comparing them side by side, the newest 1080p units for $800.00 plus or more do look a little better, but not that much. Got it home plugged it in, let it search for channels, in Dallas area we have a dozen or more, it found them all and they all come in perfect. Plugged in my sat rec, dvd player, great picture!! It is really a bargain too, I found it at my local Fry's for $1299.00. If you have to have the latest spend more. If you want a good all round TV this will do the trick!"
5,We Love Our SONY TV,"We are more than pleased with this SONY 55inch proj TV. I shopped for an LCD and/or plasma TV.. but really got a lot more for my $$ with this TV. The picture is just great!.. even better than I had hoped for. The sound is ok for everyday TV watching,.. but to really enjoy movies and concert DVDs.. add a home theater system.BEST OF ALL.. at Sears I got a super deal.. The TV was on sale for $1199.. plus I got another $250 off for using a SEARS card (paid it off the next week.. no interest). A few days later I found this TV on sale again for $989.. Called SEARS.. they gave me back $210.. so I ended up buying this TV for $739... what a deal!"
4,Overview of Bluegrass,"This collection is a great overview of how bluegrass has changed over the last 80 years. Other reviewers disagreed with the choice of adding the Byrds and the Dixie Chicks, but to assume that Bluegrass has not or can not change from the groundwork laid down by Flatt and Scruggs and the Carter Family would be limiting and fatal to Bluegrass itself. The Folk movement has added it's stamp to modern Bluegrass, a la the Byrds. The Newgrass Revival, here represented by Bela Fleck, Edgar Meyer and Mike Marshall, is equally important. I would have liked to see an Avett Brothers or Old Crow Medicine Show track as well, just to show that Bluegrass continues to grow, even as we rediscover and reinterpret the roots of it all."
5,Great book,"This is a great book, and I defenitly recommend it, along with all of her other books. Karen Kingsbury is another great choice, her books make you feel very close to God."
4,An interesting read,"I think I liked this book more because of the secondary characters than the main ones. It was fun to catch up with all your old friends from previous books. Also, this is the book we meet Shelly from Clouds and Jake from Waterfalls. The two main characters, Brad and Alissa, were interesting but I cared about them less than some of the other people this series has introduced us to in the past. The story of Rosie and her groom was a good addition. In some ways, I cared more about Rosie's story than Alissa's. It's a good book, but not up to this author's usual standards, in my opinion."
5,I haven't read it....,"I haven't read this book, but I was wondering if this was the same Alissa in The Christy Miller Series?"
3,El Mirage,"This was supposed to be Jimmy Webb's big attempt at mainstream acceptance by using George Martin to add 'commercial' clout. Sadly, it didn't work and ""Lands End"" which Webb did on his own is a superior album. Still 'El Mirage"" offers some of some of his finest songs ..'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress' (although Judy Collins still does the definitive version of this song), a great reworking of P.F.Sloan (one of his classics) 'The Highwayman' and 'If You See me Getting Smaller'. El Mirage is a brave album where 'the man' allows someone else to take control. It deserved more success than it recieved, but you can't help wishing that JW had done the thing by himself. Now, that would have been interesting!"
5,Black and White,"I can be summed up in one word ""Awesome"". Jock knows how to bring out the beauty and innocence of the young. Many of the models have multiple photo of them at various stages in there life. His work has brought caused lot of controversy.Some people think his work in nothing more than child pornography. The only thing I can say to them is, go on vacation, take a trip to Europe. Go to Germany, France, Greece, just any were outside the US and see that most people do not have this sick obsession on the naked body. They do not have ""nude beaches"" They just go to the beach some with cloths some with out. Our country has the largest % of sex crimes in the world. Why, be cause at a early age we tell our children that it is a sin to be with out cloths, we make every aspect of our bodies sexual in nature. Wake up people, being naked has nothing to do with sex."
5,Fantastic,"After having seen ""The Last Day of Summer"" and ""Radiant Identities"", I knew Jock Sturges's work was phenomenal. With this publication, he has accomplished the impossible and ""outdone himself"". The images and quality of the printing are outstanding. I give it a 9 out of 10 with the hope that in the future Mr. Sturges will consider including more boys in his published work. This, however,is not a complaint, merely a suggestion. I look forward to more from Jock Sturges."
5,Stunning!,"Having bought Jock's other 2 book's first, I felt I needed to buy this one. I sure Love this book more than his other 2. It's sheer class! Jock is in another league, compared to Sally Mann, & David Hamilton. Though I love there book's too, This is the best of it's kind available though! I hear that Jock is working on a new book, which is going to be quite differant to all his currant one's! Well, I can't wait!"
4,Better than Last Day of Summer,"This book provides a good overview of the works of Jock Sturges. There are some photos here from his other books such as The Last Day of Summer and Radiant Identities.As a photographer, his technique is very good. However he only use one style of photography and all his photos are in grey-tone and not in colour.Compared to other studies of nude photography, the many of the models of Jock Sturges are plain-looking and it shows in his photographs. Among his more attractive models, he is only able to partially brings out their beauty in his photographs."
3,Not perfect but a lot of good work here,"This was my first Jock Sturges book so I wasn't completely sure what to expect. I found it to be generally very well done with few pictures that were particularly erotic even though most were of nudes (generally of girls or women). I sometimes thought that the composition and lighting were a little odd (off centered or speck in the distance shots for example)but most poses were good. I especially liked the way Sturges showed some of his subjects as they aged through the years from childhood to womanhood. I do wish that the photo titles and dates were on the same page instead of on a separate paper, that made for very inconvenient reading having to constantly refer back and forth. Much better photographer than David Hamilton."
3,Marton wrecks it; excellent otherwise,"Excellent sound and performance all round from conductor and just about all singers (Jerusalem brilliant, and for a minor part, van Nes beautiful as always as 1st Norn).But this is ***EXCEPT*** for Marton (the key part of Bruennhilde), whose mile-wide vibrato rather wrecks the whole recording, sadly... Fliegt hei-ei-ei-eim, ihr Raben (ouch!).The photo of the 6 harps in the booklet is great (good to see that they were authentic here!)."
5,Please Steve Can we have Some More !,"An outstanding album, reaching right out from your heart to your soul. With powerful blues and and a couple of beautiful ballets, the last of which is the Incredibly touching, ""West Texas Refugee"".A must have album in your blues collection.Five out of Five Stars !"
1,Not Happy,CD was scratched or something. Any it stops about have way through the song; switched to next song and the same thing.
2,mitt gets use but towel is too thin,"my nanny likes to use the mitt for washing my baby but we have other towels that are twice as thick, so we only use the towel if the other 2 we have are in the wash (rarely)."
5,Love this set! Great gift too.,"I purchased two of these because they were so marked down and because they are organic and that means soft, and they really are. The color is not bright, very creamy since organic is never bleached which is a good thing.After I washed these they shrunk a bit especially the mitt, but I guess that is expected. They are made well, so I think they will hold up well through many baths. Would repurchase but not at full price."
3,"Everything is right, but nothing sticks","This all-star recording was EMI's bid to modernize their classic Rosenkavalier from the Fifties with Karajan and Schwarzkopf, and all three female leads are experts in their parts. Haitink, too, is quite good at Strauss tone poems. But he is a variable opera conductor, and here his bland side comes out. This whole reading seems too careful, and Dame Kiri, not exactly a passoinate soul, lends a further air of polite correctness. None of the characters seem to feel their situaiton very deeply, so we don't, either. We keep skatig over the plished surface, and in the end prettiness can't save the day."
5,Great supplement for immobile people,My husband was undergoing intensive inpatient rehab for quadriplegia and while at the rehab hospital was started on this product to give him extra calories (he's tall and skinny) to improve his weight and help prevent skin breakdown. He enjoyed the Peach flavored Enlive so much that when he came home we started ordering it for him and he drinks 2 a day and it helps him maintain his weight.
5,Excellent on so many levels,"Don't go through life without reading ""Anna Karenina."" This novel is excellent on so many levels that you can read it again and again, as I have, and still thoroughly enjoy it. Tolstoy skillfully tells two different stories simultaneously, based on the same theme: How does one find true happiness? Anna makes a choice and tries to bravely see it through, trying all the while to persuade herself that she's found happiness, but you can feel the strain build as the novel nears its climax. Levin nearly drives himself insane in his mental tug-of-war over where his place in life should be, but eventually comes full circle. In their journeys, Anna and Levin cross paths, with fascinating results. I can't stress enough that this book is a must-read. Be prepared to be thoughtful, depressed, elated and emotionally drained."
5,Who could rate it less???,"This book made me want to take notes--I didn't want to lose one insight into human sympathy, societies' hypocrosies or Russian history. Tolstoy's unparalleled exposition of the psyche and soul amaze, and the scintillating plot propels through the long read and through time."
4,"Great book, but this is for the guy who wrote another novel:","Hey buddy, nobody wanted you to summarize the book! We don't read these things to learn the plot of the story, just to get a general flavor for the book. Here's a little tip for you: Nobody reads the reviews when they're longer than about six lines anyway. When your review covers the entire page everyone's definitely going to skip the whole thing! Just tell us whether you liked it or not and why next time, OK?"
4,"Great book, but sorry for Seryozha","At first I wasn't too interested in the book and only picked it up because I because I had seen half the movie a long time ago and wanted to know what happened. I thought it was great but the matter of Seryozha was kind of left hanging. I loved it when Tolstoy narrated about Levin and Kitty, but felt real sad when he wrote about Anna. I hate Vronsky!!! I feel sorry for Seryozha and angry that he will grow up with other people's opinions of his mother and that he flushes his last meeting with Anna out of his mind."
1,Very poor translation,I had to purchase another translation just to get through it! We chose this book in our book club & when we met last week we discovered that we each had different translations. We all agreed that the Penguin translation was one of the best.
4,Not the icon that people make him out to be,"Sure, Tolstoy is a very good writer but it's a stretch to try and claim that AK is the ""best novel ever written."" I found it unfocused and slow in developing a plot. O.k., part of that is just the style of the writing of the time but that's not a complete excuse.While I enjoyed it to a certian degree because of the prose, this book is basically BORING (and that takes a lot for me to say; I read some pretty dry stuff). Even Tolstoy thought this book was crap when he finished it. He almost never published it. (Of course, what's bad for him is still better than most authors can do...)Personally, I think Dostoyevsky is a better and more interesting writer. Tolstoy is a classic, and I respect him for that, but don't assume he's great just because people (including Oprah) tell you so..."
5,Perfectly Wonderfull,"Like all of Tolstoy's novels, this book can not be praised in words. It is too high for that. No other outhor can potray the feelings of an entire nation one moment and the subltelest human feelings the next. How Tolstoy can portray a powerfull emperor in one novel and the thoughts of a hunting dog in another so vividly is a mystery to me. I'll admit, I interupted reading this halfway through when the new Harry Potter book arived so I could keep in contact with the rest of the 13-year-old world, only to return to a mushroom picking expadition that was more interesting than the entire of the previous. The thoughts of the characters are so reall, so life-like, that I can no longer enjoy other books, as there characters are to shalow."
5,Arrived in good condition,"While I have not yet had a chance to actually read the book (because of other reading obligations with grad school), the book itself appears to be in good condition."
4,Gotta love those Russians,"It's just typical. Long, and wordy, and oh, so dramatic, but if you love the Russians, you'll love Anna K. Lots of panting, and off stage bodice ripping, but also a back story about politics and a wonderful subplot about living in the Russian countryside that gives it just enough of a break from the drama. This is my second copy (I wore out the first) and am still not sure I like Anna, but I do oh-so-like some of the other characters. In the end, it's worth your time."
1,I have a strong dislike of the wordiness of this book,"This book was not good. I expected a classic, but was extremely disappointed. The sentence structure was awkward and it lacked a general sense of meaning. I liked war and peace much better."
5,Simply.. one of THE BEST!,"I found this book gave me a deep understanding of all the steps that he describes. He prefers to describe a few technics and ideas, but they are of a profound value and he elaborates a lot about it so you have a very deep understanding of it. I would say it is definitely for BEGINNER to INTERMEDIATE level of expertise... , but it is the BEST to have!"
4,"well written, helpful book","I was with my wife for 8 years (faithfully I might add) before my marriage failed miserably leaving me with some confidence issues and very very single. I felt out of practice on dating and the game seems to have changed considerably since I was a freshman in college. I have read many books in this genera since then, and it has helped me allot with confidence in general as well as specifics on dating. This book without Embarrassment and :Secrets of the A Game: How to Meet and Attract Women Anywhere, Anyplace, Anytimeare two books that stand out to me in this genera as being particularly well done. Neither are really PUA manuals, while the tools are there, but ultimately about being a man and helped me to realize some of the things I needed to work on. I wish that I knew back then what I know now. Consider getting an e-reader, I like mine and it has paid for itself with just a few e-books."
3,Some decent material,"I agree with the other reviewer that said this book is not for the aspiring PUA. Although my website the Seduction Bible deals with more with becoming a pick up artist. i also tend to enjoy reading the books more grounded in the way things are. That is why this book, along with The Art of Seduction, work for me."
5,JUST A CRAZY COINCIDENCE,"i was laying in my bed just 10 minutes ago staring at the shapes of light on the wall coming in through holes in blinds, a yellow glow of the setting october sun. I had a song in my head i'd heard keane play the night before, not even remembering the words or the name of the song i came online just now to check them out. i come across this album and the picture and name of the song are in such the mood i was just in. this is a crazY COINCIDENCE i felt like sharing. brought to you by L. Lemon. of The Milky Way."
2,Ugly,"I'm sorry to say this was a waste of money. When I got it, it looked nothing like what I was expecting. In fact, it cost more to ship it back than to keep it so I kept it....but hidden away in the garage!!!"
3,Good. Should have been great!,"First the good news. You get such pure-Fields shorts such as The Barber Shop and The Pharmacist. Add The Fatal Glass Of Beer, The Golf Specialist and Pool Sharks, you have 5 entertaining shorts. Now comes the bad news: as previously reviewed here, The Dentist is messed up. Edited and with an unnecessary score, Criterion really blew it. This short should have been a no-brainer. After all, there has been dozens of public-domain collections with The Dentist uncut and no added music! Cmon Criterion! Fix this Fields collection."
5,Simply the Best,What can one say about a man who makes you laugh so hard you fall out of a chair. WC was one of those would had that ability. this is worth the watch - more than once. classic - get it while you can since criterion dvds seem to disappear.
5,Great collection of early Fields,"W. C. Fields was one of the first, great comedians of the talkies. So much of his humor comes from his delivery that it's almost hard to imagine him as a silent comedian. Fortunately, this DVD actually contains one of his silent shorts and you can see in the talkies as well that he was actually a very gifted phyisical comedian. If you have any interest in W.C. Fields, or classic comedies from the early 1930's, you should definitley check out this DVD."
4,I liked it!,I was very happy with the product. Some good WC Fields films here. I recommend it to his fans
1,Criterion Collection Stunk!,"The above entitled collection was a real disappointment. Not at all what I expected and definitely not worth the money. Quite frankly, I was so disappointed I threw them in the trash. I know there has to be good W.C. Fields films out there, however W.C. Fields: 6 Short Films-Criterion Collection is not one of themBill Williams"
3,"""The Dentist"" censorship","As has already been noted, ""The Dentist"" is largely sourced from some later reissue with added, completely unnecessary music and sound effects. While the notoriously naughty tooth-pulling scene has been put back in, at least two other more subtle bits of censorship remain:1. When the female patient is moaning in the waiting room and the Fields' assistant is trying to get his attention, Fields originally says ""Oh, the hell with her!"" In this version, that outburst is covered (rather sloppily) with an additional patient moan.2. When Fields walks off the golf course in disgust, he originally said ""They can take this golf course and st..."" (he doesn't actually finish). In this version, the line is simply blanked out."
4,Classic Favorite,Love the story and this is a fun version complete with illustrations. Great read. Totally recommend it for anyone that loves this classic tale.
5,Good Translation of a Classic Work,"For being so cheap, I was suprised at the quality in translation of this cornerstone of christian writtings. If you are looking for a good introduction to Augustine, or want to learn more on the development of christian thought through the ages, Confessions is a good buy and a great read."
5,price and ship,"Was very happy to find these books at such a great price for my husband and then they shipped so fast, will be ordering many more from amazon.com."
3,school book,bought this for a class and actually didn't read very much of it at all. too much to read in a very little time. i'd recommend this for people interested in augustine and history of Christianity with lots of time on their hands.
4,Kim Criswell is an Annie Oakley to treasure!,"This studio recording of ANNIE GET YOUR GUN features the thrilling Kim Criswell singing the title role, as well as the booming voice of Thomas Hampson in the role of Frank Butler. John McGlinn conducts the outstanding London Sinfonietta.Criswell is an ideal choice for Annie. She invokes the brassy vocals of the Ethel Merman (the role's originator), yet manages to inject some of her own spunky charm into the character. The ballsy Dolly Tate is played by Peta Bartlett; with a very young Rebecca Luker playing the ingenue role of Winnie opposite the Tommy of Jason Graae.This recording is now quite rare; though is worth tracking down. Arguably the greatest recording of the score aside from the '66 Lincoln Center revival w/ Ethel Merman."
3,Quick simple setup and breakdown,I think the Kamp-Rite Double Tent Cot is great. Quick simple setup and breakdown make it perfect for overnight trips. Be sure to fully digest the folded dimension though(too large for most auto interiors and trunks). Our's will just fit vertically over the rear seat but we plan to get a roof rack to carry it in the future.We're still working on the comfort level which needs work (reason for 5th star missing). We also broke a clip which Kamp-Rite replaced promply at no cost. The tent is well made with interior pockets. There is room at the ends of the tent to stow some gear. We also purchased the belly storage bag. Works Good will last a long time.
1,BEWARE!,"This product works just like it says, except for the fact that the double tent cot is made for two small people (NOT ONE BIG PERSON)! When you open it up, you quickly find out that there's a metal support bar that runs down the centaer of this tent, preventing anyone from sleeping in the middle (i.e., you have to sleep on the left or right side of this tent). If you are large (i.e., over say 250lbs, that's beeing nice, really you'd have to be pretty small to sleep on one half of this thing) this tent will not work for you. I ended up getting their ""oversized"" version instead and that works very well. I wouldn't normally give this tent such a bad rating, but big folks should know about the ridiculous metal bar that basically cuts the tent into two useless halves."
1,"problem design, Cabela's quality control and review censoring","A tent that is not waterproof, what do you do if it, uh, rains. Missing parts in another review. Delight? wow? great company? Not exactly factual terms. Also be warned if using the Cabela's website -- Cabela's picks and chooses the reviews you see, that is, the reviews there are biased."
3,CTC double cot,"I was happy with the tent cot until the poles that support it broke on the first set-up. The distributor said this was unusual. We are waiting for replacement poles. The bar in the middle of the cot requires a full size foam pad (we purchased separate) for optimum comfort. Otherwise, nice product. When we get the poles we can go camping."
3,Accessibly acceptable,"Down to earth, blue-collar, blues-inflected progressive rock band made things a little funkier this time around and were none the worse for it, presenting a charming, if somewhat familiar stew of smokin' oldies."
2,Cheap Product,"Came pretty quickly, but is a cheap product and not as described! The mat will probably last a few months as it is fairly thin and flimsy! Like the phrasing, but it seems like that takes precedents and the quality took a back seat!!"
4,A fun and educational toy,I jumped the gun a little early and got this for my 2 year old. She is a little advanced so she knows how to operate the toy. She loves to play her Mickey Mouse CD and sing along. I like that there is a volume limit but it does get plenty loud. I do however have to supervise the CD insertion and removal but that is because she likes to play with the cd's and they get scratched. Overall she loves it. This is the 1st of this kind that I have bought or seen. But it is great so far. I would like to rate it again in about 6 months. Little Tikes has a great reputation so I trust it will last.One negative thing I have noticed is if it gets bounced around the cd stops.. but if that is the worst I am ok with that. It is a kids toy.
1,It was a sad Christmas morning......,"It was a sad Christmas morning when my 5 year old granddaughter opened this gift. The CD compartment wouldn't stay closed and we went ahead and fixed it with tape so that she could enjoy the player that day. I took it back the next day and found out I wasn't the only one returning it for that reason. I managed to find it at another store, opened the box inside the store only to find that it had the SAME malfunction!!! I will NOT be purchasing another Little Tykes."
1,Disappointed 4 year old,I bought this for our 4 year old son for Christmas. We could not get it to work. The cds we put in would not play. He was so disappointed that he could play with his new toy that Santa had brought.
1,Buy something else,"This product stinks!!!! I can't believe I even have to give it a star. My mother-in-law bought this for our daughter and within a week it wasn't reading CDs, I then returned it to TRU and bought a replacement one online, well wouldn't you know it wouldn't even work out of the box, so I had to hustle back to TRU to return it and can't even get my money back for shipping - not only was this a HUGE disappointment, but I would have hoped for better service not only from TRU and Amazon, but from the manufacturer. You are better off buying a much better system with a name you can trust. As for Little Tikes, stick to making plastic please."
4,Good for the Price,"I got this for my son, who is 2 and loves music. While he keeps opening and closing the cd door which of course makes the music stop, he loves using the microphones and hearing himself ""sing."""
4,Nice toy with one disappointment,"I bought this toy for my three year old son this year for Christmas. It is a nice toy and he loves it, but there is no headphone jack, it takes batteries or dc power, but is not very portable when there is other kids involved in the car, because no one can hear anything but the player, this item has everything I would desire, except no headphone jack!!"
2,Buy this game,This is the worst generic GTA ever made. The controls suck and graphics are terrible. This is a waste of money game. PS2 version is alot better LA edition.
4,True crimes,Both games work great they got to me on time games started up fine never had a problem love playing bith true crimes games
3,confused,"The game doesn't work like it will load and will show the intro, but won't go to the gameplay screen."
1,Worst than the original,"Ok I'm confused,sluggish controls,bad sound,bad graphics,not even comparible to True crime streets of LA,man I thought sequels were supposed to be better,I was excited about this one but I played a little of the beginning and turned it off in disappointment,guess I'll play the original."
2,The Sibelius was pretty....,"pretty boring! This is a piece that needs to have real blood, and yet a coldness in it at all times. This recording didn't have anything close to that. It was a standard run through for the Sibelius concerto, one that I would not like to listen to again. A plus though is that Kennedy navigates some of the technical parts of the third movement much cleaner than his contemperaries. If you want to hear this piece the way it was meant to be played, check out Heifetz/Beecham on EMI."
4,The listening ear,"I think the problem some ""critics"" have with this recording is that they are unable to distinguish between the sometimes overly languid support of the orchestra and Nigel's playing. The first movement is performed slower and more deliberately than in other performances of this passionate work I've heard, but I hear no deficiencies in Nigel's performance. I would have wished for him more support rather than having to carry the performance as much as he did... Kennedy's sound is full and rich, full of passion and warmth, intonation intact as well. Must every violinist fit the mold of the staid soloist in appearance? Some of the younger listeners have been turned on to the classical world because they can relate to Nigel's free spirit. When was the last time I read a critic who understood this? Good question."
3,A personal touch,"Whatever one's views on Nigel Kennedy's abilities as a violinist, it has to be said that he is a thoughtful musician (I used to listen to him a lot and it never once escaped me that I was listening to a pupil of the late Sir Yehudi Menuhin). In this recording, he brings his own thoughts to bear on two very weighty and demanding concerti and does so in a communicative manner. I did not find myself shedding any tears during the performance (which often happens with Heifetz' recordings) but the tonal power and scope of the Tchaikovsky in particular made me sit up and pay attention. Kennedy is not to be faulted for taking on these challenges- if anything, he makes them sound easy, and that if nothing else makes this disc worth hearing."
4,Another wonderful resource,"The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent is another wonderful resource on the Law of Attraction. While it doesn't contain as many ""new"" insights as I had hoped, the material is (as always) thought provoking and energizing. An easy read with outstanding examples of how to apply the principles of attraction in your life."
4,"Great book,- Ask & it is Given is even better!","I can't get enough of Abraham and Esther Hicks. However, I think much of this book is a repeat of the Ask and it is Given book - a life changing book! If this had been my first encounter with Abraham I might say the same thing about it. Abraham's messages have given me a wonderfully new, positive way to approach life. I'm able to make a lot more sense of the troubles of the world. Incorporating the philosophies of Abraham has made some very postive changes in my life. I will buy each and every book Abraham & Esther publish!"
3,"Interesting, but...","The channeled Abraham says nothing you couldn't actually have thought of yourself, and at times I get the distinct feeling that I have read this or that almost word for word elsewhere in much older books.Now this may be 'coincidence' but we all know that pure coincidence does not exist. I doubt very much that all of its content was channeled, it just doesn't have the right feel and twist of phrasing about it.Nevertheless, a nice book as an introduction for the novice to the magical approach of living life. To those new to the material this book can look like be and end all of learning, but it isn't, and there is much more interesting stuff out there. Once you have mastered the basics - feel free to progress and have an adventure in cosnciousness. Don't just consume, be.I can also recommendThe Wizards of Consciousness: Making the Imponderable Practicaland any of the Bartholomew books like""I Come As a Brother"": A Remembrance of Illusions. these too are easily accessible."
2,Not for me,"This audio book would be much better read than listened to. There are certain areas that you will not be interested in, and some areas you'll want to read over and over again."
5,Incredible,"This may have been the best book I have ever read, but then I say that after I read any of the Hicks books. They are all life changing, life enhancing. All of us here at work read and talk about these books daily. We even have a weekly 'book club' where we discuss things we have read and practiced. These are our lifelines. I can't recommend them enough. The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent has helped me in regards to my finances, getting fit and how I think about our government. Don't wait any longer. Get yours today!"
1,The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent,I wasn't impressed with the authors at all. They were somewhat repetitous and thus boring. They used the words vibration and vibrational a million times.
5,Extremely grateful,"This is such a powerful book & CD its like holding metal at 5,000 degrees kelvin. Sooo. . . Hot! The messages and processes of being in vibrational harmony with my desires hit home. I am eternally and extremely grateful for you Abraham, Esther & Jerry Hicks, and all of the souls and people who've helped you produce such an enlightening and powerful process."
5,"Get this one, too","Even better than the first book. Contains many easy to follow plans for manifesting anything you want. ....and it's fun, too !"
2,Agree with Same 'Ol Same 'Ol,I agree with what he/she said. Ask and it is given was a wonderful book. This one seems to just be an effort to profit more - - same information. Disappointing.
5,Great advice that works on day1,Esther is clearly an evolved channel. As a child I recall seeing my great- grandmother as a channel - her experience was like Esthers was initially. I remember seeing her shaking uncontrolably and drawing visitors from the village. I 100% believe everything Esther has to say and offer. Her words are indeed devine and have answered all my unanswered questions. Evry thing kind of falls in place - no human could possibly have all that information with no ocntradictions!I practised what she advises and have a calm sense of serenity ever since. The Stock market decline doesn't bother me anymore..I know all the fianncial mess the US finds itself in will be ok in 2009!
2,I think there are better books on the subject,"I liked ""Recreating Eden"" by Julia Rogers Hamrick much better. Basically, it discussed the same ideas but it was much more comprehensive and empowering for me."
2,Too Wordy,"This book was a little TOO wordy for my taste. I am sure to ALL the FANS of the Hick's absolutely love it, however I did not. That's just my opinion. I am off to the next book. I prefer something that is straight to the point and less fluff, if you will."
1,missing a key element,"I've read a load of bestsellers on manifesting personal desires including this one, and I found they all have one thing in common - none mentioned karma, which I think is the ultimate challenge in fulfilling your desires. Why are so many people struggling with sickness every day? Why are there so many women looking for years for a mate? Is that because they don't desire them or they are not clear on their goals and desires? These books are there to make you feel empowered, but will your reality change? Not until they address how to overcome karma. And I hope one day, there will be a well-rounded book that talks about balancing desires and karma."
3,Living the Art of Allowing,"I have been a student of Abraham and have loved their work for almost 20 years. I must say that I was fairly disappointed in this product, a 4 cd set on the The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent. It is unfortunately read by Jerry Hicks, who I am sure is a very dear person, but NOT a narrator. His recitation of the material is robotic, innocuous, fast, monotonous and in that - on the verge of irritating. I know the work and Esther's expression of Abraham is indelibly in my head, so I was able to grasp some of the heart and sincerity of the work. But, I fast-forwarded through much of the material and was glad to give it away. If I could have known the quality and lack of emotion that this product contained, I would NOT have purchased. A great Abraham injustice and diappointment."
1,I couldn't give this a serious read,"Someone gave me this book. However, the authors lost me when they started talking about ""Abraham,"" an entity of ""pure consciousness"" whom they channeled while meditating together. The wife apparently started to move her head uncontrollably and the couple figured out that she was spelling out with her nose, ""I AM ABRAHAM."" This was followed my more nose writing in the air that contained important messages from ""Abraham."" This was just so ridiculous to me that I had to put the book down. It just isn't necessary and seems like they are using this as a ploy to make extensively and already written about ideas by other authors, seem like something spectacular based on their channeling. I did pick the book back up later and skimmed some of the chapters. There are just so many other authors saying about the same thing, and with a little more intellectual depth for my tastes. Sorry this is not a more complete review, but I just couldn't give it a more serious read."
3,Good information,"I love the information in this cd, however the narrator is very dry and talks too fast."
2,This book felt really shallow,"I felt like this book was trying to offer a ""New Agey"" quick fix to the deep feelings and issues people face as humans, there were a few good exercises, but alot of it did not resonate with me a bit. I also didn't like the examples they used or the formulaic methodology."
1,Item returned,"I returned this item on October 16, 2006, and have not received any refund to date. How long does it take to receive a refund?The book is probably very good, but it wasn't what I was looking for.Joanne Cohen"
3,Channelled material,"Another ""you can do it"" book;I recommend the Avatar course ""the art of living deliberately""This is a 9-day experiencial course where you get to actually experience what this book/and Conversation with God are referring to. Much more powerful, but costly too!!!avatarepc.comEPC stands for Enlightened Planetary Civilization"
1,The Amazing Power of Drivel,"As a university professor of human resource development and an Anglican brother, The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent is pure drivel and has no redeeming value whatsoever. If you enjoy new-age fantasy, get a copy from your local library otherwise do not waste your money. If you are serious about spiritual growth you might read works such as The Rule of Benedict: Insights for the Ages, or the best selling book on spiritual development of all time.. it's called the Bible."
2,"All Jerry, All the Time","The Deliberate Intent 4-CD Collection II was a surprise. There was no Esther Hicks or Abraham, only a rote recitation by Jerry Hicks. He reads a series of ""games"" to practice improving personal intent and vibrations, and adds some brief lectures. He has a fine voice, but it lacks the expression, energy, and sense of attraction to draw listeners into a space of creativity, response, and commitment. He wants his share of the spotlight, but frankly, he's tedious."
4,"Hollywood fl Center for Positive Living says ""Thumbs Up !""","We used this book for several classes at the Hollywood Center for Positive Living in Florida and it was really well recieved. If you liked ""Ask and it is givin"" You will like this too. If channeled material bothers you and you can set that asside I think there is much here to appreciate. As always the Universe is saying ""Yes"" to you so ""Living the Art of ALLOWING"" Good and creating deliberately with intention can be a great assist to anyone wanting to change their life experience for the better."
3,Practical but redundant,"I have been following the Abraham/Hicks teachings for many years and find them inspiring. This book offers very practical advice and insight into the Laws of Attraction but I found the format to be overly repetitive. I just skipped over the end of most chapters because it was too boring. Perhaps for those beginning this journey the receptiveness might serve to reinforce the ideas but for me it was too many ""channels"" playing at the same time."
5,Living my life in ease and appreciation!,"I have been listening to the Abraham-Hicks recordings, reading their books and attending workshops for almost 4 years now and this new book presents the material in yet another format. As I've personally experienced, information I've ""heard"" many times may not land on me and when my ""wanting"" and the ""words"" match, clear ""knowing"" happens. As I incorporate these words into my daily life, I am fully alive, consciously choosing in every moment to allow the well-being that flows to each of us."
5,This Book will Change your LIFE,This book is an amazing book. I highly recommend it. It has shown me about the choices I choose to make in life. Thank you Abraham Hicks for standing on the edge.
1,Repeat of Ask and It Is Given,This book is a total waste of money for someone who has read Ask And It Is Given. This book is a total rewrite and contains nothing new.
3,Instant Replay,"I love Abraham-Hicks message and philosophy. How can you go wrong by being positive and grateful, thus bringing more abundance into your life? BUT...I have to say I already had read ""Ask and it is Given"" and found this book to be not much more than the same information shaken up and re-packaged. I also liked the way the information was presented better in that book than this one...perhaps because I read the other one first. If you are not familiar with Abraham-Hicks I would recommend ""Ask and it is Given"" rather than this book."
2,think twice,"Unfortunately, rather than being helpful and inspiring, this particular cd set is redundant and boring. There are so many things out there much more inspiring!"
3,"Monotone, Repeats Same Examples Multiple Times","This book has good material, but if you bought the audio version, you will need to be a very good listener who does not let your mind wander during monotone reading. This book is read by Jerry Hicks in a very flat, speed reading style. Many of these recordings are from other A-H recordings so be prepared for unoriginal material. Additionally, the same endless list of examples is used multiple times with very little variation which I found annoying and hard to listen to. This is from a person who listens to talk radio and recorded self-help type books on a daily basis. The recordings which feature Esther speaking for Abraham are very engaging. This one was a real disappointment to me. I wish they would stick to the format of Esther speaking directly."
4,Great choice for those looking for a life changing approach to life!,"I have read a few of Jerry and Esther's books, listened to a seminar on tape and i tell you what, these two have a wonderful, easy, and very influential theory (so to speak)about how to live your life the way you imagined it to be. This book is a great tool to have when you are trying to get a new job, finish school, get married, it can be applied to anything in life that you are wanting or needing. I really enjoyed this book, and if you are reading these reviews you are probably curious about this book, so go ahead give it a try!"
5,Law of Attraction,"This book didn't seem to flow quite as good as their last one, but if you just use 1 technique of the many offered to improve your life, it is still better than 99.9 % of the books on self improvement!"
4,Simple & Straightforward,"I was pleased to discover the Hick's new book.I enjoyed Ask and It is Given, but what I like most about this book, is it's simplicity. It gets straight to the point--not a lot of unneccessary text to wade through and process.I also enjoyed the real life examples as I am always looking for inspirational books devoid of fluff where everyday people like you and I, who are seeking to overcome a particular difficulty or manifest their hearts desire, have achieved results and/or a clearer understanding of how to bring success and fulfillment into their lives.I highly recommend this book as a resource that will inspire, empower and guide you from where you are to where you deserve to be!Happy Reading! Reviewed by M. Woods for GoodGirlBookClubOnline"
2,I like Abraham Hicks but...,"This reminds me of something rehashed from the seventies. I think it could use some sanding around the sharp edges or something. Maybe if it was the SOFTER voice of Esther Hicks, rather than Jerry, it would be more palpable."
2,The Amazing power of Deliberate Intent,I have the first two sets of cds for Ask and It is given and these new cds for The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent are just the same stuff. If you have Ask and It Is Given save yourself the money.
3,Very Interesting but Not an Easy Read,"I liked the information in this book, although it was not an easy read. It was a bit too academic for me. KISS is the best way to get this type of information out, understand it and keep the reader going to the end. I thank the author for the insight and ideas. It was useful and enlightening."
2,The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent,"I really enjoyed the ""Art of Allowing"" and could NOT put that book down until I finished it! I could even re-read that one... In comparison, ""this one"" however, just didn't hold my interest... and I never finished it!"
3,Cross Attempts to Compensate With a One-Man Show,"I am a huge ""Mr. Show"" fan, I've even seen it live, blah, blah. I hate to admit it, but the comedy on this album is not that great. Most of the bits are reminiscent of ""Mr. Show"" material, but their effect is muted by the fact that Cross is the only one talking. Many of his bits are in the form of dialogue, and in them you can hear his impersonations of other ""Mr. Show"" cast members' voices. Yes, he is sarcastic as hell, yes, he nails everyone, from God to the Promise Keepers to retarded people, and yes there are moments when I said ""Goddamn!"" But two discs of ranting, mumbling and meandering through whatever muck swishes through his head is too much."
1,Buy something funny instead of this album,"The album just isn't funny.It's not smart, clever, or witty.It was a big disappointment."
2,Disappointed,"This CD is not nearly as good as could Davis Cross can be. It's mostly a sad rant, with some ""I wish I were Bill Hicks"" elements mixed in.When is Triumph the Insult Comic Dog's CD going to be out?"
2,Three laughs total,"I don't care that he makes fun of the patriotism stuff. But it's just not a very good act. Very dissapointed. If you like Mr. Show but hate the boring, awkward, prolonged skits that show up on it a lot, don't buy the CD. George Bush bit is funny though."
2,Ummmmm yeah...,I am a huge Mr. Show fan and think this guy is a very good comedic writer. This on the other hand is a babbling and very negative drunken fool bantering on about nothing. He sucked me very quickly into a vacuum of the mind of a pi*sed of jerk. If you like unenlightened empty people...give a listen. This guy is actually very funny in other incarnations. Look for those.
1,It really Sucks!,"Being a die hard fan of Mr. Show I thought this album would be a sure thing! Boy was I wrong. This album is nothing more than a long sad meanderring political rant from a disillusioned and pissed off man. The laughs, for the most part, never started for me and at the end of the album i was left with a bitter taste in my mouth. Trust me, if your a fan of Mr. Show, don't assume this is the same humor as you'd expect on that jolly half-hour of funny. I'd like to think that David's joke was getting us to spend $15 dollars on this sad rant, and that he is somewhere chuckling quietly and counting the tens of dallars he made off this album."
2,Don't waste your time/money,"This is a terrible cd. There are funny moments and a few funny bits but, overall, I feel [unsatisfied]. While I don't mind a comic who expresses his political and religious views for a laugh, Mr. Cross tends to go way overboard. He spends far too long expressing his opinions then forgets to turn his views into something funny. I buy comedy albums because I want to laugh and be entertained, if I wanted to hear long-winded political opinions and theories I'd watch C-Span. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone; however, if you must own it, I'll be selling mine...next week."
2,Hugely Disapointing,"As a big Mr. Show fan, this was a real let down. Instead of being funny, he's just creepy and angry. You'll feel tense and uncomfortable when listening to this CD. David's timing is really bad too, for a comic."
3,A David Cross to Bear,"In a time where even George Carlin backed off his normal ""world is gonna end and who cares"" stance to fire off some self-conscious fart jokes at al Queda, it is refreshing to hear David Cross' relentless and unrepentant Bush-ripping: ""He's still the idiot he was on September 10. Of course he bombed Afghanistan... Nader would have bombed Afghanistan! Bush is only doing the job we didn't elect him to do!"" Cross' take-no-prisoners attack serves him well on bits about Rumsfeld, the Catholic Church, mindless patriotism and Promise Keepers. Cross, in his liner notes, remarks that he doesn't so much do stand-up as attacks every performance freeform, like a drunk guy at a party. This is very evident on this disc, and bears both the positives and negatives that ""drunk guy at a party"" suggests. Amusing, insightful at first; by the end of Disc Two, yeh, I sorta want him out of my house."
5,very funny,"Don't let all of the bad reviews scattered through here stop you from buying this album! If you are a real fan of David Cross then buy this, if you don't really like Mr. Show or the stand up you've seen from Cross then don't buy it. DO NOT buy this if you saw him on the Drew Carey show or some of the other shows he was on and think this will be the same cutesty humor, this is not a happy album. Even some Mr. Show fans will not get this, this has alot of religious and political ranting as well as some very humorous stories thrown in. Answer your telephone!"
5,"outspoken, irreverent, and necessary","When I first heard David Cross I thought immediately of Bill Hicks. Their voices kind of sound the same, and Cross continues the socio-political commentary that Bill Hicks continued from George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Lenny Bruce, et al. Some of the stuff David says is jaw-dropping, not because he says it, but because it's true. It's important to have at least one contemporary comedian who can rise above fart jokes to make fun of John Ashcroft, bad art in the name of September 11, and the pope."
4,Crucified by the Cross,"Good stuff. Not as great as ""It's Not Funny,"" but well worth checking out for any fans of David Cross."
1,World Trade Center Jokes are not funny....,David Cross explains that 9/11 is the day football stopped. Almost 3000 people are dead and he jokes about it...That's funny!!!?? May be Osama should be sent a copy of this......anyway........2 CD's filled with someone complaining the whole time....no kidding.....Sorry but it gets REAL boring after the 2nd track. Man...I tried to like this release but it ...! They add this fake laugh track to make it seem like there were more people there in the audience...Listen to it on head phones and you will see what I mean.....The recording quality is also terrible....You hear a buzz in the microphone on half of the tracks???? Don't waste your time or money on this one!!!!!!....David next time you joke about the WTC you should go down to ground zero and look at the grave yard of almost 3000 people....
3,Below Par,"After watching the Mr. Show as well as David's specials on HBO, I had high expcectations. Though there were some funny observations, it was nowhere near the level of his stand up specials on HBO. A very funny man with a diluted routine."
1,Stick to sketch comedy,"This was such a disappointment. David is a brilliant sketch writer, but [is a poor] stand-up. His stories seemed strained and repetitive. OK, you don't like Bush or anything he stands for, I GET IT ALREADY! Let it go and move on! Even the audience had a hard time with some of of his leftist rants. They only gave him polite appluase."
2,Out in left(ist) field,"As a general rule I enjoy David Cross' stand up routines, in addition to his great work on Mr.Show, but this septic rant doesn't do him an ounce of credit.His disjointed style can often be entertaining and refreshing, but when he does stop to focus on something, he focuses on all the wrong things. It's one thing to be edgy and irreverent, quite another to be distasteful and offensive - even to the edgy, irreverent crowd.The title of this CD is more appropriately used to review it - since about 20% of the routine is funny, for the rest you just want to tell David 'Shut up, you f**ing baby!'. So I'll give it 1 star for the 20% that's worth listening to, and another star for the fact that he hates John Ashcroft...."
1,Isn't comedy supposed to be funny?,"If you lined up all of the humourous material on the 2 CD's, you'd laugh for 5 minutes. But those 5 minutes would be F**king hysterical. Funny in places but very diluted."
3,Cross Shows Potential,"I chuckled quite a bit and laughed out loud a few times. If I could have rented the CD for $5, it would have been worth it. Not worth a purchase though."
1,Disappointing,"A few laughs, but below par for Cross. He takes aim at easy marks such as Southern racists and bumper sticker patriots but doesn't offer anything you wouldn't get out of the Guardian UK comments page, i.e., rambling vitriol.He's capable of better than that."
1,Not funny,"Many people tackle social issues with their entertainment. Many people do it well. For example Bob Dylan wrote (writes) great songs that addressed current issues. David Cross tries to do the same thing with comedy, which is a nice idea. But his jokes are not funny. Nice idea, but drawn out, repetitive, and boring. Not funny."
1,I'm not sure I have the same CD....,"This CD is by far the worse comedy CD I have ever listened to. Period, end of story. Mr. Cross thinks that he is Lenny Bruce, but he has no new ideas and says things just to be offensive, he has no new insight, is not edgy and is very, very boring."
2,Ronnie Dobbs would be shocked!,"David Cross apparently does not like George W. Bush. At all. Or anything he ever did. Ever. Or said. If George W. Bush went on tv one day and said ""David Cross is really quite funny,"" David Cross would do 20 profanity dripping minutes on what a hack moron David Cross is. And that anyone else who thinks David Cross is funny is a moron too. Especially if they, like David Cross, are from the South."
5,An excellent collection,"This is an excellent collection. All sorts of creatures and strange happenings are described, and a good number of the stories are told in the dialect of the person who the story was gotten from (Yeats & his friends traveled around Ireland collecting stories from the people they met - recording the oral traditions, if you will.)"
4,Fun and Fascinating,"This book was fascinating to read because it is about the fairy and folk tales of another country. Although, a lot of the wording was difficult to read and or to understand, it was very humorous and fun to read. I enjoyed especially the stories with a moral to the story. I love it when the wrong doers get what is coming to them!Sometimes they get worse punishments than we would have imagined doing ourselves! I recommend this book to those who enjoy these type of stories and to those who want to know about foriegn cultures."
1,Too Much Fluff,"I am one who enjoys reading folk and fairy tales, but this particular version contains too much explanation and too little in the way of tales. It was a dissappointment. The explanations are wordy and exhausting and take much away from the tales themselves. Though it is (I think) free to your Kindle, spend your reading time somewhere else."
2,is it real ?????,"In the picture it looks real....but now that I got it, I see it's fake like porclin,plastic,or somthin like that.......it was not what I was looking for!.......our friend has two real rock bowls, one quartz & one rock..he said he got his from amazon...so looks like i gotta buy another one & probably more expensive...lolz...:(dissapointed because it didnt describe material made of....thought it was real...& shipping wasn't the best....we ended up ordering 3 things from amazon at the same time.. all within USA....2 came within week,the rock bowl came in two...so semi slow shipping..."
3,Great for casual listening,"This disc is great for casual listening. The pieces featured are light and easy on the ears. Domingo and Perlman combined beautifully in these well-arranged pieces. Sound quality is also good. However, this is not a disc for serious listeners or collectors."
4,The great lost Rutles album!,"Fans of the Pre-Fabs will love this. ""It's For You"" & ""From a Window"" especially wonderful to hear."
1,The Authors should be ashamed of themselves.,"This book contains extremely little useful information. If you want all the source code generated by the IDE for a one-line code example, then all the source code generated by the IDE after changing 1 minor thing, and . . . repeat. Fills up a lot of space with very little information.Also they describe a number of event handlers - I think they cut and pasted, just changing the object name and the event name. They repeat over and over the syntax for an event handler.They demonstrate such good naming techniques as x1, x2, x3, and textbox1, textbox2.Shame on you."
4,This is it...,Although I agree with the reviewer who gave one star on the repeated code and terrible naming I still recommend this to any new Windows programmer. This book pretty much changed the way I looked at MS programming. A cool language with a great visual tool.(I never got into VB) The book is great at explaining form creation and events. I read almost the whole book in one day it was so interesting. One other downfall though is the full programs at the end of the book. I didn't find them useful.The book isn't perfect but it is worth getting.
1,Poorly Made,"Ordered this and the base to match in beige. Was thrilled when it came so quickly but... The base was just the metal part, no support piece, so a neighbor drilled a hole in the pole of the umbrella and we put it up that way. The first breeze and one of the struts came loose from the umbrella.Looks great, but save your $$$. It's going back today!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This umbrella looks AWESOME out of the box. But as you will soon find out the connection between the top pole and bottom pole of the umbrella is VERY weak. The whole thing is held together by two small loose (and stripped, in my case) screws (in that metal piece that connects the top and bottom pole). And the bottom pole only goes into that metal piece about 3/4"" so there is no stability at all there it pivots all over the place in the wind. After 1 week a small gust of wind broke mine in half. It looks nice but is TRASH and very poorly made (in China)!"
1,awful,this product broke the fourth day we had it. the button that holds the umbrella straight snapped. not going to send it back to much trouble. wrapped it in duct tape
4,Excellent Supernatural Film from South Korea,"I saw this movie awhile ago so details are fuzzy but I can say it is almost on par with A Tale of Two Sisters. It may be a bit confusing at times but it has the kind of storyline that draws the viewer in and makes one want to watch again to understand the ending better. It is an excellent example of the newer Asian horror; the kind that messes with your mind but still has a touch of the supernatural instead of the ""long haired ghost"" stereotype. Here is the description of the film:"" 'Gidam' is a horror movie about a mysterious incident that took place at the Gyeongseong Ahnsaeng Hospital in 1942.The film has attracted a large number of moviegoers with its fresh story line, scenes that appeal to the aesthetic sense and the underlying sadness behind the prevailing horror.""It's worth it, trust me."
4,My favorite film,"This is my favorite movie of all time, but the subtitles on the main menu do not work. The only way to get subtitles on this DVD is via my TV's remote control."
4,Scared the crap out of me!!!,"I am a huge fan of Asian Horror films with some of my favorites from South Korea being: ""A Tale Of Two Sisters"", ""Phone"", ""Arang"", ""The Red Shoes"", ""Red Eye"", ""Apartment"", ""Bunshinsaba"", ""The Ghost"" aka ""Ryung"", ""Death Bell"" and many others. ""Epitaph"" really did creep me out. The film has some solid moments of dread, impending doom and shear terror. Excellent horror film. Thailand has been making some great horror films too as of late like: ""Alone"", ""Shutter"", ""4bia"", ""Phobia 2"" aka ""5 Prang"", ""Coming Soon"", ""Ghost Of Mae Nak"", ""Omen"", ""Dorm"" and others. Japan has been kind of slow with horror lately except for the new ""Ju-on"" films. I know Takashi Shimizu has some stuff coming out though; not sure on Hideo Nakata. ""Epitaph"" earns a 9/10."
3,I'm on the fence with this one ...,"I bought this cleaner two weeks ago, thinking this would save me time and energy cleaning my bathroom. So far, it's doing a good job with keeping the tub clean, but I'm not too thrilled with the way the shower curtain is looking. It seems to create more of a buildup on the shower curtain. I have to take a sponge and wipe off the shower curtain three times a week.In my honest opinion, I'm not a fan of Scrubbing Bubbles, even though it was a good concept. I think I'll just stick to my Comet cleanser and scrubber brush :o)"
1,Horrible WASTE of Money!,"Not only did this not clean my shower at all, but I am now going to have to spend more time cleaning it to remove the stains it left. I was better off with a squeegee!"
1,pure crap,The inside gunks up causing it to beep but not spin. Must be a design flaw because the old style unit did not have this problem. They knew this and released it to the consumer anyway.
1,Design flaw...,"I'm not sure what it is, but there is some sort of design flaw in this thing. It really does seem to clean, but the automatic dispenser doesn't last very long. It eats through batteries every week or so. I've tried every combination possible: new batteries, different brand of battery, returned/replaced the unit several times, with always the same disappointing result."
1,Scrubbing Bubbles Shower Cleaner,"Our problem has little to do with mildew but we have a significant issue with 'soap scum' due to the effects of hard water combined with body oils and bar soap waxes and because our shower doors are transparent they show all residual matter. As a test, we tried using the liquid from the refill bottle just to see if it had the ability to work with manual application and it didn't appear to work any better than the rest of the many products we've tried. Whether or not it does, however, the spray from the dispenser does not reach the back wall higher then 6 inches above the floor and the overlap where the 2 doors meet (1/2 inch) prevents spray from reaching the second door. Even though the idea seems a good one, I can award only one star to this product because it apparently cannot deliver the results that it promises."
2,Great while it lasts!,The good:One button touch and you are done.It sprays the entire shower and keeps it clean.The not so good:Strong chemical smell.Can not be refilled with other less noxios product/requires purchase specific refills.Out first one stopped working after one month. The second one stopped working after two and a half months.Will not be buying a third one.
3,Better Than Nothing....,"This cleaner works better than nothing - but not as well as spraying by hand.If you were previously doing nothing whatsoever to clean your shower on a daily basis, this product is a lifesaver.If you were previously using the daily shower sprays by hand, your shower will be about 75% as clean with the automatic shower cleaner.If you don't always have time to spray by hand, this product will keep your shower from getting unsightly in between thorough hand cleanings. But it definitely will not leave it immaculately shiny, squeaky clean. I would plan on cleaning the shower by hand from time to time if you want the sit-in-the-tub-for-a-bath level of clean."
4,Once it got started it was GREAT!,"I purchases the Scrubbing Bubbles Automatic Shower Cleaner for my teenager's shower...you know why! When I first installed it, I pushed the button at least 17 times and nothing happened. So I called their customer service line.They were very nice and encouraged me to keep pushing as they sometimes take a long time to ""prime"" themselves. Now it works fine. We have had it about 4 months. My job of cleaning is much easier and my daughter likes to use it as all it takes is the push of a button. This was definitely worth the price!!!"
2,worthless,I used this and bought 2 of them. The first one broke right out of the box. The other one was doing well until yesterday. It kept going off all day long every minute or so. I finally had to take the batteries out to shut it up. I called the manufacturer and they will send me a refund. I threw out the shower cleaner and kept the liquid refills. I figure I can still use them by squirting it onto a sponge or something. If I were you I wouldn't waste your money on buying this thing.
1,Do not waste your money,"The commercial makes you think that it will clean a dirty shower and keep a clean shower clean, neither of these are true. At the most it will slow the eventual build up of soap scum. It doesn't work on my small shower so I can imagine that it will not work in a regular sized tub shower. I am a gadget person so I fell for it."
1,Does not hold up well,"The product cleaned better than nothing and did decrease the amount of scrubbing I had to do--WHEN THE DEVICE WORKED. I actually bought 3 devices because I thought I ruined the first two by allowing the battery compartment to get wet by not changing the batteries properly. However, with my LAST unit, I realized that the cleaning solution leaks into the battery compartment thus rendering it inoperable. Guess I was a little slow to realize that the device is of poor quality. Too bad."
4,Scrubbing Bubbles Antibacterial Shower Cleaner,"I use it and I really like it. I use once a day, right after a shower. It isn't a miracle product, but it sure makes cleaning the shower MUCH easier."
2,Think before you get this,"Does it work? Yes. Can it be improved? Big time. Shall you get this? Please read.Firstly about its design flaws: 1) It should be height adjustable. 2) It should be refillable by end-user.Secondly once you get the base unit, you'll need to get their expensive bottles forever, unless you force the cap open & use those bulk quantity shower cleaner refills like those made by Method (sold via Target).Thirdly, it worked wonder when I lived in an apt. w/ city water. But now that I live in a house w/ well water, it doesn't make my shower cleaner but on the contrary, it makes it worse - by leaving these streaks of semi-sticker residue all over! So this is not a one-for-all-water-type solution at all.It's very expensive to get their refills, those are where they GOTCHA!"
1,Unfortunate Waste of Money,"When I saw this product I was delighted to think that this may lessen the endlessly repetitive and futile chore, so I scoured the tub until it was gleaming and tried it for a month. As previous posters have noted, the unit does not spray the tub- the exact area you need to prevent scum from building up. It is also very loud, but on the good side, the solution is not harsh smelling. So here we are 1 month later and I am again slaving away at the stubborn buildup. This product did absolutely nothing and was a complete waste of money."
2,A Christmas song by a german boygroup,"I think that the boyz aren't better or worse than for instance he Backstreet boys. But there songs are usually a lot more catchy. This is a ballad but it's by far not their best song.The single includes 5 songs. The radio vrersion, the non-rap version and three remixes."
5,A Mind-Bending Trip Into Madness.,"Director Alan Parker teams up with psychedelic supergroup Pink Floyd to paint a vivid tapestry of madness, paranoia, and self-destruction. It is the story of ""Pink"", a rock star mixing drugs, alcohol, sex, and a lost childhood into a miasma that so strangles, and overloads his brain as to warp reality itself. In the end, he has nowhere to turn but within: the most dangerous place of all. Nightmarish visual imagery, counterpointed by the music of one of history's finest bands, at the height of their compositional skill, drags the viewer through an experience unlike any other previously created for the cinema."
5,DO NOT TAKE PSYCHEDELICS BEFORE VIEWING!,"The flow of this movie alone will 'twist your noodle'. Great looping storyline and excellent music that somehow all makes sense now! Don't worry folks, it is re-released, but only on DVD. I heard somewhere that ""Hey You"" and other extras are added in?!"
1,A horrible disappointment and mangling of The Wall,"I just watched this movie this afternoon for the first time and I was truly stunned and blown away with how absolutely abysmally horrid this movie is. What makes it truly unbearable is that in addition to just being a bad movie in the first place, the actual music of The Wall is distorted and re-recorded in such a horrible way -- for example, the actor who plays the teacher says ""Stand still, laddie!"" instead of the original recording, and says it very badly and unconvincingly."
2,THE WALL IS IS FILLED WITH PATHETIC RIGHTOUS INDIGNATION,"this film sucked...there is no theme, they drive no point, the acting is not very good...the music rocked. just get the cd. pink floyd is trying to tell me whats right and whats wrong...at the same time, the movie stresses tolerance...screw it, its a big paradox."
2,"it's ""just another brick in The Wall""...","Those who think books like Jack Kerouac's ""On the Road"" and movies like ""The Crow"" actually have something to say about their respective 'generations' will probably like the film version of ""The Wall,"" as well, and laud it just as highly. For me, though, the movie is a soulless, emotionally sterile, and bombastic 90-minute music video that's nowhere near as affecting as the album that inspired it. Okay, so a little boy's father dies in a war. He has fantasies about being a rock star and, wouldn't you know it, grows up to be a Hitler-esque dictator...or something. The subtle humor from the album is gone, instead replaced with super-literal interpretations of the songs. ""The Wall"" will remain popular, I think, only as an oddity in the annals of pretentious filmmaking."
5,THIS MOVIE IS F***IN BAD ASS,if ur a big fan of Pink Floyd than i definetly suggest buying this dvd. this movie is one of the best movies ive ever seen and of course the best rock movie. the commentary by roger is pretty good too...HOWEVER there is one downside. i f***in paid $30 for this dvd a year ago cause i couldnt find it anywhere. now they have put it out in f***in wal-mart. now i feel like a complete dumbass. that is the only thing bad about it was that they ripped me off. but it doesnt change how much i really like the movie.
1,a dumb movie that makes people dumber,"I'm a film teacher and I've had a number of students who were crazy about this movie, so I've watched it: they tell me that what they LEARN from the movie is that ""war is bad,"" and that crowds at rock concerts are sort of like groups in war and groups of students in school. With every fan of this film I've talked to, the bleeding obvious is converted into what they think is a profound insight. Why does this movie fool people into thinking that its tired old ideas (war is hell, crowds don't allow for individual thought, etc.) are new just because of the flashy visuals and animation? Just in case anyone was wondering, I'm not anti-Pink Floyd: I think the talentless Alan Parker is the problem here. This is one stupid film, and a pretty blatant copy of the film version of TOMMY to boot."
5,Daddy! What'd ya leave behind for me?!,"This is a good movie for The Wall-Pink Floyd's most popular album. It really helped me understand the plot of The Wall a whole lot better: a drugged rock star who shuns himself from the world and imagines himself in the war like his father was. I was a little dissapointed when I found that they cut Hey You out of the movie... until I started paying closer attention: if you think about it, The Wall IS Hey You. Roger Waters said he wasn't completely happy with the movie, but it still turned out to be qite extraordinary. My only grudge with the movie is that they changed the dialogue between the characters a little and they shortened Waiting For The Worms(one of my favorite songs of The Wall), but overall, it's awesome and a must for all Floyd fans."
4,Very well made musical film.,"Pink Floyd The Wall is in my eyes, a very good film. It is about a rock star who goes into a deep depression because of many hardships in his life, which makes him build a psychological ""wall"" between himself and reality. Based on the troubled lives of some of the band members of Pink Floyd, the rock band who scored and composed the music for this film. It is a uniquely made film using flashbacks to explain the troubled life of Pink (the main character), and some scenes which use very strange images (some animated) to symbolize some of the thoughts of the character. It is not at all a very happy movie, and in my opinion will greatly disturb some of its weaker viewers. But it is still a highly recommended film, especially for those who are fans of the band Pink Floyd, of whom I am very big fan, and for those who want to see a very unique style of film."
2,Stereo CD sounds better,"I'm a fan of the wall. I was hoping for a good 5.1 transfer. The 5.1 sucks!!! The stereo version is much better sounding. They funnel all the vocals in to the center channel speaker. It sounds out of place,they should of kept the vocals true to the orginal recording(L&R). I would not buy again."
4,Dour and mesmerising,"You should watch this. It is not the easiest of films to view or follow, but the marriage of the music and images is sometimes irrelevant, and at others brilliant. Geral Scarfes cartoons are a real treat and there are occasions when there is real (black) humour. I often wonder about Roger Water's mental health; is he chronically depressed, experiencing psychosis or brilliant? A must for Floyd fans, should be watched by as many others as possible."
5,Great movie. Very disturbing.,"First of, the quality of the DVD was good. No skips or anything wrong with the audio. As far as the movie itself. You have to wonder how many kinds of drugs was in their system when the movie was written. Unfortunately, the plot does resemble what society was like at that time. It's not a family time movie, that's for sure."
5,"Arborescant, daedalian and coruscating","This film is animated with brilliant and inspiring artistic views of mulitple subjects. Anyone who is a fan of deep journies and classic music should own this one. The only films that match this are Akira, 12 Monkeys, and TooL's Salival."
3,Listen to the album first.,"The album is a masterpiece. The film is like a really good film student project. That is not to say it is bad really, rather it lacks the same groundbreaking production quality and innovation heard in the album. A much more satisfying music/movie experience is Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii. Now that is something extraordinary."
4,Underrated,"As an album ""The Wall"" is below par for a Pink Floyd album. Get ""Animals"" or ""Wish You Were Here"" instead. However with this film along side it, it becomes much better in my opinion. The visualisations are appropriate without being intrusive to the music and the animation is in places breathtaking. In short, this is like ""Fantasia"" except good. Deffinatly worth a watch if you are a Pink Floyd fan."
1,"All in all...just another milking of ""The Wall""","Don't get me wrong, I love Pink Floyd (and The Wall too) but this constant rehashing of DSOTM and The Wall into ""Anniversary, Special Editions...ad nauseum"" is just plain ripping off the fans.How about the long awaited DVD release of Pulse or Delicate Sound of Thunder instead?"
4,Pink Floyd - The Wall 25th Anniversary (Deluxe Edition),"Excellent DVD, I watched it with my wife and my kids 25 and 15.This music spans through the generations."
3,It could go either way,"Of course, Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" is a legendary album (3rd best selling of all time for all genres) and is one of my favorites ever. The movie is weird and doesn't make much sense, and is very psychadelic, like Floyd is. Worth a watch if you like The Wall. P.S.- the Pink Floyd members aren't in this."
4,"A great movie, but how is it a ""special edition""","I am an ardent follower of Pink Floyd and recently purchased the VHS re-release. Although the movie is just as good as I remembered it, contrary to what you see above, the VHS edition is NOT in wide screen format. There are very few added scenes, but nevertheless it is a very enjoyable and well-done movie."
4,The movie that explains it all,"I bought the wall, the movie because i really like the wall, the album. IT starts as out Pink, the main character, not born yet's father in the war, then goes through Pinks life and all of his problems. This movie explains all of The Walls Lyrics. In the movie there is next to no talking. I rated this movie 4 stars because it has too much blood and graphic sex, and would not be apprpriate for the younger audiance. If you liked the Album the wall, then you will defidentally like the Movie. I hope you found this review helpful."
2,Terrible Picture,I often heard how great this film was and finally decided to see for myself if the reviews would stand or not. This is an incredibly shoddy and boring piece of work. There is nothing but boredom in this production. I think the only decent scene was some of the fascist stuff but that was it. Not recommended at all. The director also flopped out with 'Evita' another lacking film.
5,Top 5 movies ever.,"The Wall is a great movie about the pink floyd bassist and leader (at that time) Roger Waters. It's a non-linear movie, really hard to understand, full of metaphors. It was made in the 70's and it discusses lots of actual themes. The only problem of this movie is that it's too much non-commercial, what makes lots of people to not like it...It's like nothing i've ever seen. It's an album made to be a movie and a movie made to be an album; by that you can imagine the sync between images and sounds.The treatment of the images is really damn good. The contents of the DVD is really amazing too. Of course, for those who like Pink Floyd, the dvd is even better.It's really worth to spend the money."
2,Dont believe the hype...,"Ok, just like the album, ive watched (listened in the case of the album) this several times, both sober and not-so. I must say, although many people like it, i think it is pretty boring. Just like the album there are spots of absolute genuis, but there are plenty of times that you would kill for a fast-forward button. Some of the acting, and all of the animation, is riveting, thought provoking, and just plain intense. But after is all said and done, youre left with the feeling of... ""what a waste of time"". Rent/Borrow it to check it out. Then buy it if you like it, but DONT spend your hard earned bucks just because the hype says the wall is great."
3,VHS Tape version is NOT widescreen!,"For those of you hoping for a widescreen version of The Wall on VHS, don't get your hopes up ... although it's advertised as a ""widescreen"" edition, it's not. How could they? Guess it's time to buy a DVD player."
3,Not the same,"I have loved this movie for a great deal of time and decided to upgrade to DVD after the demise of my VCR. I was shocked, after ordering this DVD, that the packaging was different than my college roomate's 25th anniversary copy of the wall. His looks like it is in a real DVD case, and mine appears to be a low-impact environmentally friendly piece of garbage. I mean, the movie is what I really care about, but it just doesn't fit comfortably in my DVD rack. Perhaps this packaging information was written somewhere on the site and I missed it -- oh the problems of purchasing in haste... Had I seen it in person, however, I would have put it back on the sales rack."
4,Classic,Movie was a bit pricey but came through in a crunch for a last minute gift. Arrived on time which was a biggy.
5,"The best video of all time. Stoners abroad,SEE THIS ONE!",If you wanna good movie to get high with this is the one
1,Pink Floyd The Wall,"I can not watch the film as it is the wrong regional code.I do not recollect any instructions regarding this when ordering this, i live in UK and would have thought my region would have been known. Paul WellerPink Floyd The Wall."
2,Brilliant...,"In a visual perspective, it's provocative, shocking, and highly disturbing to the point of it being too overwhelming for words...but overall, the movie creeped me out!"
1,This movie screwed my life up,This movie screwed my head up.You probably have to be stoned to wach this.I will never look at anything the same again.
2,Pathetic,"I was looking forward to the movie, but it was dissapointing. In fact, my sister walked out within the first 45 minutes of the movie.1) I hated the animation of the film, especially when the two flowers are having intercourse.2) I hated the acting, if you could even call it that (the people were basically just staring into space for the plurality of the movie.3) I REALLY hated the sexual depiction. It became way too out there when one of Pink's peoples raped the girl, and also when Pink's wife was cheating.4) I did not like the amount of gore and violence. I mean, why does he need to go into a pool of blood for no real reason!But, at least the music pulled me through, and there was some type of plot entact."
2,Not the Same,"I am a huge Pink Floyd fan but I have to admit, this movie lost something since I was a kid, although I suspect I'm just getting old:( Very strange movie, hard to follow, but great music & I must admit, Bob Geldolf did a great job as Pink."
4,GREAT MOVIE BUT DVD LACKS A BIT,Great Movie ! Can't argue that but the DVD lets it down a bit. The menu items do not work properly unless the dvd i bought is faulty? Nice cover though.
4,Hissing sound,The video portion of this DVD is 5 stars. However the sound quality is very poor. I could hear hissing all the way through the movie. Very distracting.
4,Now it makes sense!,"This Pink Floyd classic looks and sounds better than ever on this DVD - I just wish I had 5.1 Dolby Digital! (I may just have to upgrade my audio equipment just for this). Besides the brilliant film itself, the purchase price of this disc is worth it just for the TWO documentaries included, plus the ongoing commentary by Roger Waters (who seems to lose it in some sections, but regains himself) and animation director Gerald Scarfe. A casual fan such as myself greatly benefits from the behind-the-scenes and history; it'll make sense after this! A must-have for any music fan."
5,AWESOME..TRULY GREAT MOVIES,"WHEW...WHAT A MOVIE TO WATCH,SO POWERFUL,THE MUSIC AND THEANIMATION WAS'SUPER'.THANK'SFOR A SPECIAL FRIEND OF MINE,WHO ASK ME TO GET A COPY OF THIS VHS..AT FIRST,I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA OF WHOSE PINK FLOYD..BUT NOW..WOW..IT'S TERRIFIC..THE ONLY SAD THING WAS THIS IS NOT AVAILABLE,PLSCAN YOU HAVE IT RE-RELEASED AGAIN..I DO FIND A HARDTIMESEARCHING TO BUY IT..I JUST GOT LUCKY THAT AFTER SEARCHINGFOR ALL THE VIDEO RENTALS HERE IN JERSEY CITY..FINALLY,I FOUND ONE..THIS IS ALREADY A REPRODUCTION OF MGM...SO PLS...PLEASE...HAVE THIS""THE WALL"" REALESE AGAIN."
5,Historical awesomeness.,"I've seen the movie before but only here and there, now I watch it all the time and really happy I own it. There are versions of songs that aren't on the album that I get stuck in my head now and I can only hear with this DVD, definitely an item to have for the Pink Floyd fan."
2,The Wall,"The product mentioned that it was for all regions but I couldn't play this particular disc in 3 different players, a reg dvd player, a blue ray player and an xbox player. We tried a regular movie in them and it worked fine. I'm not saying there was anything bad about the disc but I shouldn't have to change country codes just to watch it then switch it back to watch other movies. There was no reading material in there either, just the disc which I found kind of odd. No matter though I'll just find another one."
1,it's the same as the previous DVD release...,"If you've already bought ""The Wall"" on dvd, this is just a re-packaged version, it has no additional features or footage."
5,The Masters Of Rock !,"After watching this movie...I was screaming ""Pink Floyd ""R"" The Masters Of Rock, for a long time ! Maybe it will change your point of view of life!"
5,"Pink Floyd-The Wall, a great movie, thank you, Roger waters","In few words, The Wall is really a great movie. Pink, the main caracter who turn in nazism after his break up with his girl friend and a very bad childhood. the mix movie/cartoon is really good. Finally, I saw this film twice and I found it very excellent !"
5,It was very hallucinagelly correct with some killer visuals.,My favorite part was when the flowers turned into plant eatears and were trying to bite each others heads off. The way they flowed gave a good since for the word tracer.
3,Alright,"Watching this interesting video and listening to Pink Floyd's always great music, I came to a conclusion: ""The Wall"" is the musical documentation of what it is to grow up white male in today's society.I just realized that. No wonder white boys everywhere across the country have this album."
2,Not quite,"I rented this thinking that it would be entirely trippy cartoons like in fantasia except with the freedom of modern art. But alas no. It tries to set a movie to the album with a few songs missing and one extra. Ok i love the album it is magnificent but by putting a movie to the music you don't get the chance to actually listen, the scenes get kind of drawn out and repeatitive. The cartoon snippets are awesome yes but the take a back seat to the predominent live action parts.It is the story of Roger Waters so you got to feel for him a bit, it tells his story but why mix that with the music and inserted trippy cartoons."
5,Exelente!,"Creo que el amigo que da clases de video esta totalmente equivocado!, me parece que el tipo simplemente no puede entender el mensaje intrinseco que lleva una produccion de esta magnitud, que mezcla en la ""psique"" de ""Pinky"" la caja de pandora de nuestra sociedad, de nuestro mundo en estos tiempos...Solo me queda decir que esta pelicula es EXELENTE y que debe subsistir en el tiempo!...Por favor saquenla otra vez para que podamos adquirirla en todo tipo de formatos, el tradicional VHS o Beta sin dejar a un lado todas las cualidades de un DVD...E. Zamora. A."
4,"If I had my way, I'd have all of you shot","I love ""The Wall,"" both movie and album. The story is very close me, so maybe I'm a bit biased.I've heard people say you'd have to be stoned in order to watch it. I disagree, I understood it perfectly. ""Tommy"" on the other hand...now there was a movie you'd probably have to be stoned in order to enjoy!I give it 4 stars only because the album version of ""Mother"" was better. Plus, the movie doens't have ""Hey You."" (It was filmed, but was cut out of the movie. See it on the DVD and know why)."
4,A must see for Floyd fans!,"Especially for those who own the album ""The Wall""; the movie is a Floydian necessity. The music of ""The Wall"" tells a story that may not be fully understood by listening to the album alone. It may be necessary to also see the movie to get the full picture of what songwriter Roger Waters was trying to get across. I recommend that you see the movie. Sometimes you might have to see it more than once. In order to fully grasp, I recommend that you buy the movie and watch it whenever you are in the mood. Its meaning can change every so often and the experience is amazing."
5,The Most Powerful Movie of all time,"It is hard to sum up how great this movie is in a compact review. Let me assure you that it contains some astonishing footage from an incredible director, as well as gorgeous animations from that of Gerald Scarfe. This DVD version is packed with extra features. Two music videos, a documentary, retrospective, lyrics, and more! Any Pink Floyd fan MUST BUY THIS! It is my favorite movie of all time. I also strongly reccomend that you also have a copy of Pink Floyd's amazing Album ""The Wall."" One cannot be a substitute for the other. The lyrics tell the awesome tale of an imaginary character (Pink Floyd). The movie is mostly the album to visuals with little dialogue. If you absolutely hate Pink Floyd (something is seriously wrong with you, but also:) you may not like this movie. Otherwise, I urge you to purchase this at once!"
1,bad disc?,"Beware of this product, I didn't have time to view it immediately on arrival, the disc causes my dvd player to shut off, it's too late for me to return the item."
3,"Interesting Movie, but Boring...","This is a very interesting movie, and i also recommend you to buy the album, but it's also a very boring movie. You don't understand what happenning there, and the sessions looks like the words - strange and hard-to-understand...But after all, this is a classic movie."
2,Overrated Rubbish,"An overhyped load of rubbish. A bad ""visualisation"" of the album and stage shows. Bob Geldoff is excellent as Pink. But this is the only good part about this film.It certianly makes the story easier to understand than it's album and stage show predacessors. However it's shoddily done and all the acting with the exception of Geldoff is hammier than a pig sty.Also several tracks are edited or just completely left out of the film. The keyboard solo from Run Like Hell is absent and Hey You isn't even used!.I have a lot of respect for all three of the individuals responsible for this flick. But the love child of their often unfriendly affair is nothing more than an overhyped musical that tries to be as gruesome and cold as it possibly can.Stick with the studio album or even better the BRILLIANT Is There Anybody Out There? live album."
1,PLEASE!!,How many more bull#@%$ DVD's do we need to see before you bring out the 2 live DVD's?? Come on already!! Talk about milking it for what it is worth!!
5,Excellen! both sound and video quality! Must buy!,This is truly the best DVD I've bought. its too bad there are no more PinkFloyd DVDs. this dvd also includes intervies and also HEY YOU which is not in original video.I say just get it!
2,Animation is the saving grace of this whole farce,"I normally dont write reviews.....but seeing the amount of reviews heaping praises on this absolutely languid film, i feel rather compelled to ensure that people are not mislead. Of course it is my personal opinion but i think it is required of me. My contentions are that the acting is tepid, the concert scenes look corny (run like hell), and the pace is unnecessarily slow. There is no art here..for example, the scene where the school kids rebels is done stark(yet unpowerful) with no subtlety and when there is symbolism it isnt very intelligent...(children going through meat grinders?).i'm giving two stars for the animation which is visually stunning and conveys a very powerful message to the viewer....other than that...give this a miss....i wished i had a wall between myself and this movie!"
2,Too Much Dramatization,I was disappointed...too much movie and not enough music. I doubt I will watch this much again like I do the Pulse DVD...that one rocks!
5,"An ever-lasting classic. At least for 3 or 4 generations, anyway.","Great film that penetrates the thinkers and artists alike, a dark film that many find leaves them feeling bad yet wanting to watch it again. Most of us have, many times."
5,My Ears Are Still Buzzing,"I just finished reliving the greatest Film/Rock album of all time!This DVD delivered 5 hours of entertainment, with all of extra tracks that came with it!Stunning Visuals!Outstanding Sound!See Roger in a humourous interview.His commentary is a wonderful new insight to his thoughts. This man shines!Buy this now for outstanding enjoyment!8 Stars!"
3,This IS NOT the original release!,"For those Pink Floyd fans out there, like myself, looking to add another great movie to your DVD collection, take note before purchasing this one. This is a great DVD, no doubt about it; however, if you have seen the original on VHS, you might be disappoionted. There are scenes cut, the music is changed and the movie as a whole is not as ""dark"" as the VHS version. I was dissapointed. I had purchased the DVD to save my VHS, it got frequent use, but the VHS is still watched and the DVD is sitting on a shelf collecting dust."
1,Give us something worth buying,"As others have said, instead of trying to sell us the same thing in a different cover, we're much more likely to part with our money if you give us something we havn't been able to see before.Many of the Wall live dates were filmed for a possible video release. Put this on a DVD and I will buy it. Re-release next year on HD-DVD and I'll probably buy it again."
2,What?,"Not what i expected, i was giving this as a gift, and they were not happy with it. I will defendtly return this item."
2,"Interesting Movie, But TERRIBLE SOUND on DVD","Yes, I love the album The Wall. The movie is interesting to watch, a bit longwinded toward the middle but overall worth a couple hours of time. The extra features are as spectacular as promised - gotta be at least 4 hours of material on this disc.Unfortunately, no matter what sound configuration I used (including 5.1), the sound mix on my copy was atrocious. Either the volume had to be all the way up at 85% to hear the dialogue, or 35% to keep the neighbors from complaining about how loud the music was. For that reason alone, I would not spend money on this product - it's definitely a rent before buy.I really wish I could give this more stars. The movie is fascinating and the music is superb. But, like other good movies that could have been great on DVD, The Wall is ruined if the audio track is messy, as mine was."
5,Awesome!!,I thought this movie was great!You get an in depth look at Roger Waters and how his life was going at that time.It's a great movie!
4,"Cookies, juice and money","This book makes the history of medicine, especially blood, interesting, and accessible to anyone. It also exposes the blood industry, GOOD and BAD, with names and dates of the people who moved it along: the medics in World Wars who risked their lives, the brilliant and tempermental researchers, and the greedy. Starr gives you well-documented facts and lets the reader decide, as a good writer should, who is the bad guy. This book doesn't tug as much at your heartstrings as Bad Blood: Crisis in the American Red Cross by Judith Reitman, but that's by far an advantage. She would have you believe that just because people died (of AIDS, and Hepatitis), there must be someone in the blood industry at fault. There certainly is some fault to go around, but this book helps you decide who and why there is fault, and tells both sides of the story without leaving Reitman's huge empty gaps in the evidence."
5,This book is the bible of research and information on blood,"I originally took this book out of my local library to do a research project for my final exam in History. Since the culmination of my research, I have rented this book three more times in to read it for my own enjoyment. The topic of blood is purely fascinating. Starr has brilliantly written a book that informs the reader of important issues, as well as being entertaining and thought provoking. The reader gets a profound understanding of the importance of blood that spans from the 17th century, though World Wars, and through current problems with AIDS in the world's blood supply. I have never read a nonfiction book that has kept my attention as acutely as this one. This book is truly one that you'll want to keep."
5,Fascinating,"This is a very thorough, and thoroughly interesting, book about blood. It might be hard to imagine that one substance could be the subject of a facsinating history, but it is just that. This book is almost like a series of stories, one building upon the other, and it has ignited my interest in medical history generally. I wholeheartedly recommend."
1,Doesn't work properly!!,"Don't buy any of these proto motion comics. I purchased a few of these & only the two Daredevil one's & Wolverine Origins worked. This one & the Hulk versus Wolverine, & along with the Avengers; none of them worked on my DVD player or laptop. When they did work they either froze or began skipping. Naturally, I returned the bunch back. Again, don't waste your time or money on these."
2,Very disappointing overview,"Boy could this one have been soooo much better!Don't be fooled. Very short in-car camera shots. The footage of Nurburgring is amazing, but so little of it. Why not give us the whole lap instead of small clips faded in and out? F1 is sitting on so much more they could have provided for this DVD and didn't. The Long Beach footage is spectacular, as is the Haikkonen pass of Schumacher at Belgium '00, but it's too little for the price they ask.As far as the length, 40 min of in-car, then a long, boring extended sequence of F1 champions.For the price, go somewhere else."
4,Historic Formula 1,This is a very good DVD that shows awesome on board images from every stage of formula 1.In fact there are so many of them that this type of filming can be a little boring after some time.Ideal for real enthusiasts.
5,Formula 1...,"Formula 1 is bright with with history, favourite race drivers and teams and the sounds of the sport. Combine all these and you get this video. The sound of a V12 is different from a V10 is different from a Turbo V6 and theyre all the foundation of most fans of this sport. Great video. Turn up your speakers."
2,Was hoping for more.,"I bought this based on the good reviews posted here on Amazon but was very disapointed. While it was great to see legendary racers like Hill and Stewart, the quality was not as good as I was expecting and I would have liked to see more modern day in car camera work (which of course is far superior to old time strap a camera on the car technology) that details the great tracks in F1."
4,Even more spirit filled than his other albums.,"You might think because this is his fourth or fifth album , it wount be as good but this is jamming ."
1,poorly made,It took less than a week for this to fall apart. poor construction. also too small to be practical.
5,A nice easy read to get to know lovely characters,I have enjoyed the three books that were written by Jan Karon. Just recently I received her bedside book and her cookbook. Now I am learning about her characters and enjoying them all. These books are for people who like to read a cozy and enjoy the characters. I like the small town image.Audrey Barth
5,Just love these books,I am in love with the Mitford series. These are easy to pick up and read as much or as little as time allows.I wish that I could be a part of the Mitford Community as it sounds like a place I would be very comfortable in living there.
5,Inspiring read,"I enjoy reading a book where I come away feeling good about life and inspired to live better. Karon deals with real-life problems like children with no caregivers and terminal illness in a positive, uplifting way that's true to life. Father Tim's thought processes are normal responses instead of picture-perfect ""priestly"" rhetoric. The dialogue of characters like Dooley and Puny is funny and rings delightfully true. The townspeople are so alive I feel I know them and would love to sit and chat."
5,Small Town Life for the 90s,"The Mitford series revolves around life in the small southern town of Mitford and its favorite local minister, Father Tim. Read and find yourself immersed in the lives of the townspeople, feel as if you too have a home there and become a devoted fan of this series that gives one the desire to move to Mitford. You will enjoy the antics of the various townspeople, maybe you will recognize a few from your experiences. You will long for the seasons, the town and that slower lifestyle as you enjoy a marvelous read!"
2,Disappointed,"After 3 months of using this slide maybe 8-9 times it wouldn't hold air anymore. We only found a couple of very small holes and patched them but still the slide wouldn't hold a child. After major investigation we found that the inner lining of the fabric in the doorway had shredded. Air was escaping because the vinyl lining underneath the fabric was ripped. These weren't little tears, it was unfixable. Little Tikes customer support said ""too bad, it's past the 90 day warranty"". I've always loved Little Tikes products but this was a major disappointment. I ended up getting some vinyl at the fabric store and gluing it over the doorway fabric. We were able to use it today, thankfully. The kids love it, it's very fun, but it's not very durable. I agree that it's a pain to put away. It takes in alot of water and takes forever to drain out and dry out. I would never recommend this product to anyone."
3,Not a happy camper,"I would have happily given this slide five stars except that we used it for 4 months total when it popped on us. No one over 40 lbs was using it at the time, and we were not using it improperly. We used it last summer without a problem. We pulled it out this summer and used it a handful of times when it just popped out of the blue! I contacted Little Tikes about it, and their warranty on the inflatable items is only 90 days. They refused to work with me and have been ignoring me for the past month, so I am quite unhappy with their customer service. I am looking into purchasing another slide from another manufacturer because of the poor customer service I have received from them. Truly, though, while it lasted, we were very happy with this slide."
1,Sad waste of money...disappointed kids,"This slide was Awesome when we purchased this less than a year ago. This year, it doesn't hold air or the weight of my little ones. It is sad as we had planned an outdoor party with their 7 yr old friends and now we have no slide. This product was purchased after researching others for their durability. Little Tikes is supposed to be a good quality manufacturer- Not so with this item AT ALL. This was not a cheap purchase either as we paid close to $300 for it last summer and can't use it this summer. Please, I advise not purchasing this for your kids unless you do not mind throwing away your money. This is NOT a durable item for your family. This will not hold up."
2,Poor durability,"While this slide is a lot of fun, there are major drawbacks. It is very time consuming to dry, deflate and put away. Also very heavy, so that it pretty much takes 2 people to do this. The worst thing though, is the lack of durability. We developed a split in one of the seams last year after only 5 uses and then at the end of summer, the slide developed multiple holes - too much to effectively repair. i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE OF THE POOR DURABILITY."
2,Not durable at all,"We bought the slam n slide for our two kids to use during the summer. Probably used it about 3 times a week,completely taking down and putting it back up each time and it lasted for only about half of the summer. Once it got water inside, it was impossible to dry out and then the two layers came apart and ripped across each of the outside walls. The first couple tears or holes we fixed assuming it would last a little longer, but it was short lived. The hoses all cracked at the joints and I had to patch each joint with a hose clamp to make it work.It was fun while it lasted now the new version is smaller, made of the same material by the same manufacturer and costs $100 more. Definitely not worth it if you consider value for your money."
5,The Definitive Brahms 1st Piano Concerto,"Kovacevich gives a spellbinding performance of Brahms' 1st Piano Concerto. Although he is a speed demon at the keyboard, he never forsakes his excellent technique. And I might add that his playing is as vibrant and lyrical as Gilels' critically acclaimed Deutsche Grammophon performance (Gilels/Jochum/Berlin Philharmonic.). Without a doubt, this has to be one of the two great recordings of the Brahms 1st, alongside Gilels'. Sawallisch and the London Philharmonic are admirable accompanists, playing as well as their peers in Berlin. Those looking for a modern digital recording should regard this as their first choice."
5,"This is the ""One"" that makes it!","I have more knives that any one person could ever want, need, and/or use. Why I don't know. The wife says it's boarder line OCD. Well maybe? With that said - ""this is the one that makes it into my pocket every day"". Super quality - holds a razor sharp edge, compact and super comfortable! Need I say more?"
2,"Blog on SOG: Twitch better than Blink, I think...","Based upon my experience with the Blink, I ordered a Twitch when I thought I lost my Blink, then I found my Blink the day my Twitch arrived. For my tastes and needs, I'm glad I ordered the Twitch, because the Blink, I think, has just too small a blade...at 55 mm or 2 3/16th inches, its stubby length just doesn't..cut...it. The extra 1/2 inch length of the Twitch's blade, and it's narrower profile allows it to slice cheese, bread, fruit, steak, rope, and perform general tasks more effectively. Its extra weight of about 1/2 ounce is worth it, to me. In my medium large hand it handles better, and the secondary opening blade ""kick"" provides a nice finger guard.So, the Blink is too short, too wide, therefore clumsy in hand and use. Twitch it is, for me.Both are beautifully constructed, the bead-blasted aluminum handle actually has some positive tactile ""traction"" for even calloused fingers."
2,Small blade for the size of the knife...,"I had a SOG Twitch I and lost it. Since I didn't remember the model number, I bought this as a replacement. The knife is larger, but the blade isn't really size appropriate for the handle. In the end, I returned it for a Twitch I.Anyway, there are lots of small folding knives out there, and I'm happy with my other SOG knife. This one just didn't do it for me. Others may feel differently though, and that's OK!Matt"
1,SOG speciality knives,"I find the SOG knives to be clumsy, awkward, slow access. Check out Buck, made in USA products. True one hand operation. With fore finger, flip the lock safety back, flip the ""trigger"", voila, eyes closed, blade is out and ready. SOG, meanwhile, the slide thing has to be moved to the ""red"" ready access, then maybe with one hand after much practice, you may have a blade out. For a reliable switch blade alternative, in my opinion, the Buck is the only choice. And the Buck is razor sharp and seems to retain edge. My SOG knives are good letter openers, edge seems reliable, and are fun to play with. But not a ""carry"" unit if quick access is a consideration."
5,New Bible for Filmmakers Everywhere!,"If you are making any kind of film, or telling any sort of story, the information in this book will make it better and deeper. There is a ton of information on how to tell a VISUAL STORY, which none of the other film books I've read cover in so much depth. The sections on how to use visual metaphors and symbols really helped me to understand how films tell stories using pictures and actions. I've never seen a book with so much useful information packed onto each page. There are 100's of lists of ideas for the reader to choose from in a great step-by-step preproduction process. The digital parts on storytelling are revolutionary and really helped me see where I could use some simple techniques to make my film more hip and original. Essential reading for any independent filmmaker working in features, documentary or shorts. I just love this book! Buy it - it will change the way you think about making films on a micro budget."
1,WHAT A JOKE!,"This book was a total joke and was a total waste of time and money on my part. This author, Sherri Sheridan, has no integrity, as she will self-indulgently give her readers second-hand knowledge, common sense sentences and ideas that serve no purpose then to pad her book, and rehashed renditions of information that are better said elseware. Buy this book if you like fillers and bad drawings."
3,This was sort of a blind buy,"I had never heard of the film, and pretty much it was the fact that James Coburn was in it that I decided to give it a try. A decent movie, but not a 'classic'... it tended towards a slightly slow pacing but was interesting to watch."
3,dvd,good movie . the actor are good. the music is good the story is good the sound is outstanding. the color is great la airport is coloful
4,Snake does the job,We ordered these snakes to attach to a stucco chimney to scare away birds and they work beautifully!! They seem to be durable from afar. They have not fallen apart and they have been attached for quite a while. Great job!
3,Stripes,This toy coral snake can be used to demonstrate the difference between the stripes on harmless King/Milk snakes versus the venomous Coral snake. The tooth structure is horribly incorrect though.
1,waste of money,"How can you make a wet to dry steam iron that you can't put water into...nor can your hair be wet when you use it? If by steam they mean the steam that comes from anything you plug in and reaches a certain temp, then how is this different from any other flat iron? It does get hot pretty quickly and have high settings but other than that there's nothing special about this iron. It was cheap though so I guess you get what you pay for. I would have been better off paying a little more for a better iron.:("
3,Stick to the actual comic book.,"The first thing that hits you is the voice-overs. When you hear the people read the text of the comic book, you kind of feel sorry for them. You're like, ""God, these people can't read."" And then it hits you--you paid money for this. Then you feel sorry for yourself.I read The Ultimates regularly, and I'm from the camp that thinks Marvel Comics should re-tool their whole market in the ""Ultimate"" line of storytelling. But this digital comic book thing will never get off the ground unless they can (by some miracle) get celebrities to do the voice-overs."
2,Waste of Money,"Marvel Comics scored a winner with the publication of The Ultimates. A retelling of the classic title The Avengers, this new look at the old characters lent them edgy quirks that really brought their personalities to life. The art was interesting, the plot contained some surprises, and the action was exciting.But that was the comic book, and I'm writing a review for the DVD version.I'd have to say that the DVD is okay as long as you never read the comics. It essentially comes off as a long Saturday morning TV episode, with a perfunctory plot and little character development. The art is flat, uninteresting and utterly forgettable. Added to that is the miscasting of the talent to provide the voices, with Bruce Banner's faint Bronx accent more suited to an apartment house's super than a super brain who is Earth's last scientific hope.Rent this dog through Netflix and save your hard earned for the Spiderman 2 DVD.James R. Rummel"
5,You will fall in love with this hero!,"If you pick up this book, you are going to fall in love with the hero. Never has a book provoked so much emotion! This book is a keeper that can be read and enjoyed time and again! This is the first book of a three book series. The Gambler's Heart and The Heart's Wager are just as wonderful! Gayle is truly gifted. This book is going to be re-released in December 2000 - I recommend it to anyone who loves dangerous romances that are full of love and emotion."
4,Fantastic story with an unusual hero,Gayle Wilson writes an engaging story of life's imperfections and the struggle to find love. This is a must read for any romance fan who really believes that love conquers all!
3,where's the tools and urls?,Pros: discusses the real pitfalls in trying to keep repositories up to date.Cons:1. This whole meta metadata terminology suffers from technojargonitis...simple words that justify return on investment are needed2. Where's the working tools or urls to sites that you might find tools? A book that neither includes a CD nor references to internet sites for further research seems out of date.
2,IT BROKE,"IN THE FIRST WEEK, MY 20-POUND COCKER BROKE IT WITH ONE TUG. THEY WERE HOWEVER VERY RESPONSIVE IN GETTING ME MY REFUND."
5,Excelente correa,"La correa es excelente. Es ideal para entrenar a mi Labrador y además no me lastima las manos, ya que el agarrador está protegido por plástico"
2,Writing style is ok - plot is inconsistent,"There were several inconsistencies that I found in this book that made it hard for me to get into it. I don't usually pick apart Silhouette books but these were just too glaring.The heroine feels guilty about tricking the hero's father, starts to feel angry at the hero, and then the very same page is agreeing to continue the role with a smile, just because the hero says it's ok.**SPOILER** The heroine convinces a client that he has to stay with the company because of the hero's commitment to the company. Then in the very next encounter with the hero, he's learned the error of his ways and is going to sell the company. Oh, good going.All in all, the book was inconsistent but the writing itself did flow well. I would read another book by this author."
4,Saturday morning nostalgia,"If you remember waking up early to watch this show on Saturday mornings, you will not be disappointed. Probably one of the best kids shows in its era. Reminds me of what good sonic the hedgehog was and why I used to enjoy it. Good memories..."
5,An excellent show.,"I am very happy with the quality of the boxset. This is my favorite Sonic the Hedgehog series, and I would recommend this to any avid fans of the original Sonic era. Plenty of additional content to supplement the boxset, and the shows are in glorious quality. I really enjoy having individual cases for each season, especially since it uses quite a lot of fan art to color the DVDs, case inserts, and the cover. This is a very well put together (and very professional-feeling) boxset."
5,Best cartoon evar,All anyone needs to know is that sonic the hedgehog A.K.A. SATAM is the greatest cartoon series that ever has and ever will be made. If you are in anyway a fan of well written stories compelling characters and dark settings you need to buy this set I cannot say enough good about this show.
5,Sonic the complete series,The show was very good it was exactly the way I remember it form watching it when I was younger it is a very good cartoon for young children because there not foul language in it and that is a rare thing now days. I also received it in about five days and it was expected to arrive several weeks later but it came very early so that was good.
4,The classic sonic cartoon,"This is one of my favorite cartoons ever and the dvd is cool, I like that they put fan artwork on it, that was really cool, I love that jaleel white(steve urkel) is the voice of sonic steve is awesome lol.I havent got much else to sayesceppt one setback no subtitles for the hearing impared.so if your deaf dont buy it."
4,I love this series,"I'm a die hard sonic fan and have always loved this particular series growing up. I remember getting early saturday morning to watch this series.However there's only one particular thing about this DVD set that makes me disappointed. No Subtitles!!! I could have sworn I remembered seeing subtitles when it was shown on ABC during my younger days. How in the world did this get left out? All the work has been done already.It's a big deal for me cuz I'm hearing impaired. I guess, I'll enjoy looking at the cartoon and remember the days growing up."
2,Too Dark,"When remembering this series from watching it as a kid, I think of it as fun, humorous, bright and exciting.When watching it as an adult, all I see is how evil and dark it is. Sure it's fast-paced, but it's definately not something I will let my children watch."
2,Good Set - Poor Special Features,"The first thing that I wouldn't have done with this set is let the fans draw the covers and the menu art (Ken Penders did a not-so-fantastic job with the cover art). Most Sonic fans have a poor artistic sense to begin with. I imagine that most of the artists that got on board to do the art were from the Fans United for SatAM forum.I'm only picking this up for 2 things, Season 2, because I haven't seen Season 2 in ten years and to have the kid-in-bed DiC logo on DVD (I HOPE they kept it in there and haven't replaced it with the rainbow globe!). I could care less about the hyped up, possibly poorly produced special features. SatAM fans are known for poor quality."
3,Bayou Hoodoo,"Coming from New Orleans, I was fascinated with voodoo and the mysticism that surrounds the area. However, I'd never heard of Hoodoo. Being a fan of scary movies, Gena Rowlands, Kate Hudson, and spirit worlds and dealings, how could I refuse this movie? While it wasn't the best I've ever seen, I loved it!"
3,HEY SCOOBY!,"You remember those cool old Scooby Doo cartoons where they introduce like 3 characters and from there you have to try and piece together who is behind it all? That's sort of how this movie feels, minus Scooby of course. That may seem like a slap but it isn't. It just has a tight (and generally good) cast which makes it so. The ending sort of feels like an old Twilight Zone; another plus.Throw in some pretty good camera work (the lock tumblers turning, love that stuff), a nice soundtrack, a generally untapped theme (hoodoo), a VERY GOOD HD DVD transfer and you almost have a four star movie, I'll compromise and say 3.5 out of 5.Thumbs Up - Mild Recommend."
3,Not quite the movie...,"...I expected, and not anywhere near being the classic ""The Sixth Sence"" is -but all in all an indeed entertaining and watchable supernatural thriller. A bit fast-forward story, at least I experienced ""The Skeleton Key"" this way, and you can very soon tell where it's going -but the ending might surprise you anyway, just don't expect it to be too clever nor interesting.The acting is good, John Hurt perhaps in a bit wasted role -but hey, someone had to play it, and he does well with what he has to work with.I expected more from the surround, you might as well watch in in stereo. Picture-quality as with todays' standard.""The Skeleton Key"" as a horror-movie being it was written by the man behind ""The Ring"";This is not a very scary movie, in fact I didn't jump in my seat once. A few minor tense minutes there at the end of it, but nothing remembarable. Not a must-see, but no waste of time either. An ok thriller, promising perhaps a little too much..?"
3,In the end it's good,"At first I thought that this movie was gonna be a dumb, not at all scary horror/thriller film. By the end, the movie turns into a pretty entertaining movie with a pretty smart ending. The acting is as good as it can be coming from Hudson. An entertaining film from the Big Easy."
3,Meh...,"Can't remember this movie, probably means it wasn't good enough. Instant video is cool though, no waiting for a DVD!"
2,Horror,"Thought it started out good, then steadily got worse, the ending was different but by that time you were ready for the movie to be over with."
5,Great suspense movie!,Great suspense movie depicting the practice of voodoo in the south (New Orleans). Love the plot. Keeps you at the edge of your seat in suspense.
4,Skel Key...,"Nice little loozeyanna ghost storeh.The acting in this one is pretty good.Hudson is a hotty, and she does a commendable job here.Her costars do well, too.The setting, sets, and camera work are well done and do a good job, but fell short of capturing the cajun area feel. Other than the plot itself, its more just ""southern"", rather than cajun. But for those outside Louisiana, that is HARD to reproduce.The story is a nice change from the regular old Hollywood mill. They tried Hard and put together a nice film.A solid 4* picture."
4,Southern Ghost Story With Magic,"A young health care professional disgusted with hospice care takes a job looking after a dying Southern gentleman. The lady of the house is very old South but they manage to get along. To help care for the man she is given a key to the whole house, a skeleton key.But there is one door in the attic that the key will not open. Soon the suspense of possible ghosts builds and thickens. Slavery, prejudice and hoodoo seem to be part of what is going on in the house. Before long lines are crossed from psychosomatic to belief and the story surges forward at a furious pace.The mix of ghost story and magic really worked with the Southern setting and created a truly chilling story. Not a straight ghost story, not straight horror film, but a unique blend with a fresh twist that really raises the hackles. Check it out."
3,Would have been OK as a made for TV movie,"This would have been OK as a made for TV movie, but it suffered from a story that was too predictable.Within the first 30 minutes you knew the ending, no surprises, no twists and it really kind of dragged along.A good movie to watch for 2 hours of entertainment, but probably nothing you will want to see again or add to your permanent DVD collection."
3,I GIVE IT 3 &1/2 STARS,"they said it had a good ending that we couldnt predict?they said it was such a shocking ending that it would leave us speechless? will this is what i have to say the end was predictable not saying that it was a bad ending cuz it wasnt.but the end really wasnt that good. this film its self is pretty good. i really like kate hudson in this film so its an A+ on the casting. and the story is very good. i really dont get in to movies with voodo,but i really did like this one.i would have gave it four but i didnt like the ending so its 3 and a half still a good film tho"
2,New Orleans before the flood.....,"Is about the only thing going for this puppy - DOA! Kate Hudson dressed in skimpy underwear wandering around in a creepy old house (in the bayou of course) might be enough for teenage boys, but thats about it. Gina Rowlands and John Hurt are just ""collecting"" their checks in this one. Basically the big ""ah ha"" at the end (the exchange of characters - ghosts for the living) might have made for a good Twilight Zone or Night Gallery episode - but at two hours - it is like watching something slowly sink in quicksand. One would expect more from such a talented cast and from a director who made the wonderful ""Wings of a Dove"" - one really wonders how a project like this gets greenlighted - what a waste!"
1,The ending ruined the enitre movie for me,"This movie starts off a little slow, but once it gets going, it is like a run away train. Honestly it could have been a four or a five star movie. The girl takes a hospice job for an old couple and weird stuff starts happening. She learns of the voodoo magic going on and the dark secret of the house.****SPOILER****The reason I hated it is how it ends. The girl is tricked into making a ""protection"" circle in the attic to keep the evil old woman at bay, but it turns out to be a holding circle. Then she starts working her spell to trade bodies with the girl. The girl fights back and loses. I can't say for sure why, but the ending really annoyed me and my wife as well. I watched this yesterday and it is still annoying me."
3,A decent movie that could have been much more,"A young hospice nursing student takes a job in the poverty-stricken, race-defined Terrabone Parish of New Orleans. Her job is to take care of the dying Ben Devereaux, but his wife, Violet, who on the surface seems so loving, appears to have deeper ulterior motives. And then there is the house, a living thing animated by ghosts. Caroline's curiosity and desire to help Ben draws her further and further into the world of hoodoo, as she desperately tries to find a way to thwart his wife and save Ben. But she also brings herself closer and closer to a deadly confrontation with Violet. A decent, but overall weak, movie that had the opportunity to be a fascinating social commentary on the nature of race and otherness, but that movie seems to have been lost in the editing."
3,Pretty good.,"Its an interesting story line and the performances for the most part are great, but the movie drags in the middle and makes the viewer hurt for the end. By the time, the twist ending began I no longer really cared what happened I just wanted it to be over with. Still I watched it through and for the most part wasn't disappointed. This isn't a jump out of your seat horror movie so if that's the kind of movie you're looking for look elsewhere."
5,Cool Movie,I love this movie. Its awesome and I didn't know what happen until towards the end. I like Kate Hudson performance in this movie. I enjoy it every time I see it. Its set in New Orleans you can't beat that.
4,Thiller,This movie was a great thiller. Kate Hudson did a wonderful job. The story was great and acting was wonderful. I really enjoyed this film. I also really loved the ending. You think you know what is going to happen and it's just the opposite.I had never heard of Hoodoo before this film and it has made me want to look it up.Quality acting and breathtaking cinematography offer a beautiful and authentic atmosphere for the story to take place.
4,Good creepy thriller,"SEMI-SPOILER WARNING. The ending was great, the atmosphere was great, the acting was great. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is that it's a little light on the horror, which matters because it sets itself up as a horror movie. Writer Kruger sacrificed some suspense in order to get the great ending. Up until then the movie felt like a bunch of random pieces, and it was a little frustrating trying to put them together (although fun, too). The lack of suspense was due to not knowing the nature of the threat. The threat is not revealed until the end (other than knowing ""something bad"" happened to John Hurt), so what horror there is must come mostly from the atmosphere. These are really just nitpicks, though; overall it's a great little thriller."
4,A thrill.,"I just watched this recently and I was surprisingly pleased. Kate Hudson does a great job here, as does Peter Sarsgaard and the rest of the cast. I was not expecting what happened at the end. This movie keeps you interested and you get a nice plot twist at the end. This is worth buying, I would recommend it."
3,Pretty Good Supernatural Thriller,"Not as good as something like ""Nomads"" - but above average nevertheless.I won't go into plot or any story detail - that has been done here well enough by others.Suffice to say - the movie is a cautionary tale about superstition and the power of 'belief' (good or bad) to effect one's life.A pretty good scare!-CrowTurtle"
4,WOW! It Was Actually Good!,"Hey I can't believe it. I saw it, I took it all in, and it was actually good. Never been a fan of Kate Hudson, but she carried this movie quite valiantly.John Hurt's the man.Don't expect anything terrifying. Just a good suspense/thriller with yes---a very suprising ending. You probably won't see it coming, and if you're anything like me, you'll have to chew on it for a few minutes to put the pieces together.Maybe not a buy (*see ""The Others"") but definately a renter."
4,A good suspensfull spooky film with a either love it or hate it twist at the end,After the horriable Ring Two we needed a good thriller and here comes a good one. The film was a flop at the box office but I think will do good in video. The film has a good story about a women who nurses an ild man in a old southern house that holds deadly seacrets. the movie is not scary and has no jump moments but it's just suspsnfull and spooky. The film has good acting and direction. The downfall is the twist I did not know if it was good or bad and mad me think( I think people will either hate ot love the ending). Overall it was a good spooky suspensfull film.
5,Excellent,"Since more than enough people have given a synopsis of the movie's plot, I won't do that. Suffice it to say that I found it to be excellent. The Louisiana setting is perfect, the mood and pacing is well-timed, the hoodoo lore and explanation of its difference from voodoo is intelligent, the ending is fabulous (very un-Hollywood), and I even liked Kate Hudson. Recommended."
4,"""The Skeleton Key""","Storyline: A young woman gets a job as a caretaker for an elderly dying man. As the movie goes along, creepy events keep you guessing until the end of the movie.The movie took awhile for it to get to the part where Kate Hudson gets the job, and I almost walked out of the theatre. But as soon as Hudson gets the job the movie becomes interesting and exciting. I'm glad I stayed. You should definatly see it!"
2,talented cast and director wasted on this film,"The acting and direction of Skeleton Key are high quality. The story line is not.Something is wrong in a bayou home, where Kate Hudson's character cares for an invalid man. It seems 'hoodoo' is at work, and souls such as his, are either being entrapped, or tortured, or something.Hudson is hot stuff on the bayou, and John Hurt (!) has a creepy bit part as the invalid/hoodoo victim. This cannot save the film however, as films require an interesting plot, and development of empathy with its characters. What I cannot forgive, is the lack of CCR's 'Born on the Bayou' on the soundtrack."
3,Anyone who'd give it more than three stars is nuts,"A lot of movies are like this. The journey of going through it is the fun part and you end up with a mediocre or lackluster ending. Then you go to bed and wake up the next morning, thinking that movie was really stupid and a waste of time. I think this movie is an utter waste of time. Watch something else. The only redemption is the main character's body."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:By relying on tension and chills instead of boo-moments or a shaking camera, The Skeleton Key managed to rise above the morass of the modern American horror film--even if no one noticed at the time, it's a very effective movie with a fitting conclusion."
3,Take it or Leave it,"I had no desire to see this movie, only when my fiance insisted did I give in. Quite frankly, I was not too impressed. It was very suspenseful and engaging...to a point. It's the story of a young home hospice worker who moves into a terribly creepy residence with a strange woman and her mute and immobile husband. During the beginning I found myself being draw in, curiously interested in the meaning behind the man's so-called stroke and the odd behavior of his wife. The plot takes many interesting and surprising turns, but the ending left much more to be desired, webbing the whole plot together with a practice called ""HooDoo"". Not the best thriller, not the worst. If you're extremely bored and the movie store is completely wiped out, sure, pop it in. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
3,Keep grinding those bricks,"The Skeleton Key is a tolerable piece of hoodoo hokum but there's a much better film struggling to get out. Along with a reasonably interesting story idea all the ingredients are present: The attractive female lead, the classy supporting cast, the atmospheric location, and some excellent cinematography. What's missing is tension. This is a slow-burner, and there's nothing wrong with that, except here the flame is barely alight at times. The first two-thirds of the movie are pretty uneventful and would have benefitted from a few good shocks to keep the audience awake. Despite a solid performance from Hudson she struggles to keep things moving with a plot that really needs winding up. The twist at the end is reasonably satisfying although the outcome will be at least partially divined by the observant viewer. Overall this isn't a bad film but it doesn't live up to it's potential."
2,More Hollywood horror,"If it wasn't for the great cast, this movie would have ended up in the dvd store very quickly. The pictures of the traditional southamerican scenery are nice, but I cannot recall a single frightening moment in this entire movie. Isn't a ghost story supposed to be scary anymore these days? I feel as if this movie could have been a lot scarier than it was. It was like watching North and South with a touch of voodoo/hoodoo.(SARR)"
3,The last 30 minutes saved the film...,"The last 30 minutes of the film saved it for me. It wasn't boring, but it didn't hold me in my seat, until everything starts to come together. then I was on the edge of my seat. Sit through it and be rewarded."
4,"A Creepy, Supernatural Treat","""The Skeleton Key"" is one of those pleasant surprises in a movie, where everything works very well and the end result is a pleasure. I will not go into a boring synopsis of the main story as other reviewers always do (after all, these are reviews, not plot outlines). And I will not spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't seen the film yet. I saw this movie expecting the typical ninety minutes of cheap thrills, and I was very wrong. When it was over I was dying to watch it again. The writing, atmosphere, and acting were dead on. I wish they made more creepy movies like this one. Good, spooky fun."
4,The Skeleton Key,The movie is a horror type movie which I love. It was very good and had a surprise ending.
4,A Very Effective Atmospheric Thriller with a Killer Twist Ending,"I just got back from seeing The Skeleton Key starring the ever cute Kate Hudson. The first 90 minutes or so were good, but I would have given the film only 3 stars if it weren't for the ending. There are a couple of twists towards the end, but the final one is totally unexpected. I thought surprise endings were played out after all of the recent films that have tried to copy the Sixth Sense, but this one really caught me off guard. This film isn't scary in the least, but it is rather suspenseful, has great bayou locations, and Kate Hudson turns in a good performance. Worth checking out in theaters."
2,It can open any door... But never really does.,"I was so let down by the ending of this movie that I don't even know where to start. Friends told me how great of a twist this film had and how I would just love it... They were dead wrong! I felt that the end of this movie was cheap, predictable, and really, really stupid! How many time are we going to have to see this crap over and over again???Please, if just have to see this movie rent it first. You may just be as dissapointed as I was!"
1,"Do not waste the time, if you do not believe in ghost and magic much.","I do not believe movies have to be scientific, but this is is too far out. So if you are not deeply religious or someone who always believe in ghost or magic, you might not want waste time on this. The movie itself might not be too bad. But it will be just a total non-sense to you.Also the characters in the movie lacks regular common sense. Either the director is trying to insult your intellence or himself is not too logical. So if you consider yourself are somehow intellectual, think twice before buy it."
1,This movie sucked.....,"I don't know what people are talking about because this movie sucked. I gave it 1 star just for the hottie in the lead role. I was never scared, or in suspense, and when I figured out what was going on, I just moaned in disbelief. I am still waiting for a good horror movie. Until one arrives, I'll stick with the old standards. HOODOO sucks."
1,Didn't Like This Movie,I would not watch this movie again.The movie was good all the way throughbut didn't end right. Let's just saytime for the trash.Don't buy it!
3,Good but not great...,"I was very excited to see this movie when I saw the trailer for it. I was expecting it to have the same creepiness as ""The Others"" but scarier. Well, this movie is not ""scary"" at all. It is a little creepy but thats it. It is actually more of a drama. The ending was surprising but forgettable. I think the story line was a little confusing. I left the theater with some unanswered questions. The performances are wonderful. Kate Hudson really shines. If you are looking for frightening movies similar to this one, I would suggest ""The Ring, The Others, Identity"". Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie, I was just expecting to see a horror movie."
1,.........,they sent me this movie instead of john johnson's skeleton key!!!! i guess amazon just picks up whatever movie is named skeleton key without bothering who its made by. this movie looked bad so i threw it out. and they recomed buying this with john johnsons skeleton key 2!! wtf?? people are gonna be stupid enough to buy skeleton key 2 thinking its a sequel to THIS movie! hahahahahhahahahaha
2,Don't waste your time....,"This movie was extremely disappointing. First off, it was not scary AT ALL. It never creeped me out or made me jump once. Second of all, it was ABSURD! The ending was ridiculous and the whole plot was ridiculous. Save your 2 hours...."
2,Not What It's Cracked Up To Be...,"I bought this after several of my friends raved about it and, knowing my taste in movies, recommended it to me highly.I shouldn't have believed the hype.One of the other reviewers wrote that they didn't understand why Kate Hudson's character's story was told. I couldn't agree more. There wasn't a thing interesting about her. Oh, she's a pretty, perky hospice worker who wasn't there for the death of her father. Oh, the irony... *yawn*Sure, it has a nice twist at the end, but 90% of it is pretty evident from the first 20 minutes of the movie. The other 10% is catchable if you pay attention through the movie rather than yawning and/or debating about turning it off.I'd never heard of hoodoo before watching this movie and the bits I picked up from the movie interested me enough that I don't consider it a total flop.It reminded me of The Sixth Sense a bit, if you take out the annoying kid and every ounce of novelty and interest that movie held."
1,I did not like this movie.,I watched this movie 2x and I am still not sure who was who and what became of the children. If there is a viewer out there who can clue me in please do so.
4,The Skeleton Key,"I have always loved a good horror or monster movie, the scarier the better. Maybe it was the weather the day I saw it, maybe my mood, maybe just my attention was really tuned but this was without a doubt one of the most unsettling movies I've seen in a long, long time. My wife won't even watch it again and doesn't even want it in the house (hence why its for sale). It just about scared her to death."
4,Good movie!,"I really enjoyed this movie, just enough scary/suspense filled moments and an awesome non-happy twist at the end!"
4,Effective,"This film is flat out entertaining. Only needs to be viewed one time though. To purchase this film would be a waste. The cinematography isn't grand. Kate Hudson, is dull, yet pulls the fright out, although ANY actress could have played this role. Rowlands is wonderful and bright in her performance. All in all, the writing IS this film. Keeps you hooked without the ""care"" you'd feel in some other films. Not one boring moment noted in this picture. Rent it, but don't buy."
2,Movie is 4 stars but the DVD is 1 star,"This DVD is listed as the Directors Cut, but truth be told it is just plain hacked!! This dvd cuts out most of the kill scenes. It looks like a version you would see on Tv without the commercials. Even with all that is cut out, this movie is still very good. Can't wait for a uncut version...Hopefully Blue Underground picks it up and releases it on Blu-Ray!!"
2,VILOENT AND VERY GOOD AT ACTION AS FOR STORY.......,AN EX-VIENTAM VETERAN GOES ON A RAMPAGE WHEN HIS BEST FRIEND IS KILLED BY A STREET GANG AND VOWS REVENGE. THIS IS A VIGLANTE MOVIE FROM START TO FINNISH AND NOTHING MORE. GOOD AND VILOENT ACTION AT THE EXPENSE OF A DECENT SCRIPT NOTHING LIKE CHARLES BRONSON'S DEATH WISH(1974)WHICH IN MY MIND IS THE ALL-TIME BEST WHEN IT COMES TO VIGLANTE FILMS.
1,What the...,"The Exterminator was one of my favourite 80s revenge films. Violent & gritty, a no holds barred hedonistic delight. The DVD release, however, sucks. There were some pretty realistic effects for its day, but these have been heavily edited and it shows. I wish I'd know this before I wasted my money on an inferior DVD release. Don't make the same mistake!"
4,exterminator,"Great film for the low budget i am sure they had to work with,and pretty decent acting all around especially steve james who is only in about the first quarter of the film.Worth renting for slow evening."
3,He never use a flame thrower,"The movie is ok for a 1980 low budget movie, BUT!!..don't spect to see him use the flame thrower or molotov...what ever you want to call it...cause is NOT GONNA happend"
2,THE SEQUEL'S BETTER,"I first rented this when I was about 15 & my mum went apes**t. A movie about a guy who kills people with a blowtorch. COOOOOL! However the blowtorch isn't that big a player in the movie. This is your typical Vietnam vet revenge story ad nauseum. Vet Ginty seeks revenge on the creeps who ripped up his best friend with a clawhammer (Steve James- who briefly adds ""life"" to the movie). There are some hilariously bad gore scenes, including the decapitation in the opening scene which has to be seen to be believed, and how could I forget the sequence with the meat grinder? I'd advise you not to eat a hamburger while watching this movie. Worst of all though is the godawful country-western song which plays during the opening credits. Yeech!"
3,Fair movie,"I like the movie but like I said by watching it on vhs there are some scenes that were cut. On dvd all scenes will be seen, but the price for the purchase of this movie is too high. I would have loved to seen a better ending for the movie. I think the producers should have put in a better profile and background about the killer who helped his friend. Other than that I always liked watching this movie. Drop the price of the dvd and you'll have a lot people purchasing the movie including me."
2,not for people who already write,"i didn't care much for this book, although perhaps it would be helpful to a beginning writer. Holmes' advice on keeping a notebook, for instance, seems rather obvious. and her 'you can do it too!' attitude gets grating.what disturbed me most were all the examples. i didn't learn anything from them--this book just seemed a showcase for holmes' work. i don't mind a book written by a conservative homemaker, but this book should be about writing, not about her views on life. Nor did i particularly care to learn how succesful she was in her career as a columnist. to anyone who already knows anything about writing articles, i would recommend saving your money."
1,Strength and How To Obtain It: With Anaomical Chart,"The book came without the chart. The book by it's self isn't worth the paper it is written on, nothing but letters about how great the author is. Since I didn""t get the chart I returned the book for a refund."
3,Some good advice,"If the reader overlooks the racial bias which the author has, and it is not very savory, and just remember when it was written, and see it as a exercise book (in fact one of the first exercise books) then there is some good advice in it especially for its time. But I gave the book 3 stars because of the author's bias."
3,Good Overview of Philosophy Teacher's Life,I enjoyed reading this from the standpoint of finding out what it might be like to teach and write in the field of philosophy. McGinn was honest about the tedious and rewarding parts of such a career. The author's writing style is clear and unpretentious.
2,a profound waste of time,The only thing I learned from this book was how great the author thinks he is.
1,discription is misleading,"this item is not a light bar!!!!! even though the shipping weight says 90 lbs and will mount lights up to 6""......this is the bracket that mounts it to the frame....a total of 2 lbs......GET THE DISCRIPTION RIGHT........thanks for nothing"
4,Princess Diaries Times Two,"This collection of Books 1 and 2 gives you more of an insight into the saga of Mia, an awkward teen, who suddenly finds herself a Princess of a small country. I saw the movie before I read the books, and found them different from one another. The movie is very Disney, while the book is filled with more angst and depth. While I enjoyed the movie, the books themselves are worth reading in order to get the real sense of Mia's inner thoughts or ""diary""."
3,Seems kind of expensive for 802 words!,"I have reviewed this book on Amazon, and my review can be read without paying for it - need I say more?!"
2,I don't think you should buy it...,"I bought this after reading all reviews. It is very simple to use. The coffee was really just not hot enough. The unit shuts off as soon as the water is dispensed. There is no heating plate. I take mine with milk, so after I would add milk, I wanted to reheat. I was going to send back, and the glass decanter was on the table, my dog bumped the table and the decanter hit the floor, glass in a thousand pieces, so cannot return. Cannot find replacement decanter to give unit away to someone else. True story. I do not recommend."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my husband's birthday. It worked great for about a month, then the water wouldn't pour anymore. My husband would have to stand there and hold down the start button. If he let go, the water would stop pouring. The sprout also broke off. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk."
2,"Nice, but for the carafe","I bought this, and really liked it. I dropped the carafe in the sink while washing it, and broke it. I liked it so much I ordered a whole new set just for the carafe. Well, within 6 months, the carafe is broke again. So, I give up. If only they made it replaceable, which it should be as it is so fragile. So, if you're a careful person, go for it. If you expect things to survive a small breeze or stern look, look elsewhere."
2,"Not hot enough, not durable","I bought this item 18 months ago and used it on average twice a month. The glass beaker just broke, the kind of clean snap you get from sudden temperature change, even though I always pre-warmed it before use. Replacement beaker: $13 - for a $30 item.While it worked, it did an ok job. I measured the water temp once and it was 12F lower than recommended by most french press coffee how-to. And the metal filter of the press has sharp edges. I cut myself once while cleaning it. That is unfortunately common for many french presses.I'm now going to do what I should have done originally: buy a nice electric kettle, and a manual french press."
1,Fragile Pot,I really liked this French Press but... after only using it for one week the pot cracked. I did not drop it or misuse it....it just cracked while I was brewing a cup. The glass may have cracked when the handle was attached...but quality control did not catch it. West Bend replaced the pot.
1,Broke after 2 uses !,I only used this twice . I went to use it this morning and it will heat up but won't brew . I am very upset that it broke after only 2 uses it was not worth it for the price!
4,Kinda Small,"I am new to the concept of French Press, so didn't really know what I was buying. If you're like me and thinking of trying it, here is my impression. There is no way to set the coffee so that it will brew itself in the morning. You have to physically get up and turn it on. You can put the water in the night before, and put the coffee in the pot, but don't make the mistake of putting the pot on the unit, because the water will drip out into the pot even though the unit is turned off. I thought this would make enough for my son and I to each have a normal coffee cup full, but it really only makes 2 cups that are about 2/3 full. It takes a good 6 minutes for the water to fill the pot, and then another 3 to 4 for the coffee to brew, so plan on 10 minutes of waiting in the morning. The coffee is good, though, and it makes great tea from loose leaves."
3,West Bend Coffee Press 57040,"After trying unsuccessfully to purchase a replacement carafe that broke, the company informs me that this model was discontinued several years ago and that they never did sell replacements parts to anyone else. Would have like to have known that prior to purchase."
3,Buy the Three Pack and Save Time and Reordering Hassle,"This comes in a three pack for under $3 a filter. So I find it worthwhile to buy the 3 pack and save the money and the hassle of not having to reorder or go out and purchase locally every time I need to change it out.Other than that, the Aqua Clear carbon works just as well as anything else."
4,An Offer of Truth,"Besides being a good story, this novel has an important message about the legal process in civil actions. One cannot assume a judge is unbiased or that witnesses will tell the truth. This book, though not entirely believable, shows what could happen, especially when very large sums of money are at stake. If more citizens were aware of the limitations of the justice system and the ease with which a court can influence the outcome of a case, it might be a first step in getting better judges and higher standards overall in civil cases. Worth reading for the story and the message."
4,An Offer of Truth,"A REALLY GOOD READ, AND SINCE THE AUTHOR IS A PERSONAL FRIEND, I MIGHT ADD THAT THE BOOK IS MILDLY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL!gREAT FIRST ATTEMPT,AND AM LOOKING FORWARD TO BOOK #2!"
2,:(,"This product is super cute, but like other reviewers have noted - it wouldn't fit and kept slipping off. I was not happy."
3,Didn't Fit,I ordered 2 of these for our tub faucets but they did not fit. They were really cute but unuseable.
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!!!,This is shit!! I return it. It doesn't fit my spout at all. Way way too small. I found no way to put it into my spout. Return it and I need to pay for the shipping. Regret x 10000000.
3,bath facucet cover,very cute and does the job the only problem i had is i had to cut a whole on top of the head in order to pull up the shower head to take a shower - to much of a hassle taken it on/off.. I think its meant for older faucet or faucets where the shower tab is separate. my daughter loves it though
2,too hard!,"I have a 10 month old baby who always wants to stand up in the tub but he's not totally stable on his feet yet, especially in the bath! I bought this to protect his head in case he fell against the faucet. The product is just about as hard as the faucet itself! If you want one just for the novelty of it for your kiddos, it's perfect. I'd recommend it! But if you're ordering it for the same reasons as I did, keep looking. This is not it!I should mention again that it is adorable & seemingly well made. Just didn't work for our needs."
3,Didn't fit the bathtub faucet,This is a cute item. It was a gift for my grandchildren - but unfortunately it did not fit the bathtub faucet. We tried it at my house an also my other grandchildren's house - but it didn't fit those either. It is a cute item and the kids would love it if it only fit. The seller delivered as expected so I have not complaint. I did not try to return the item.
3,Meh,While the elephant is cute and does protect the end of the faucet it blocks the pull-up knob for the shower so we will have to pry it off somehow when my company comes to visit so that the adults can use the shower in my spare bath. I have seen similar products that have openings for shower knob which might be a better idea.
3,Sturdy and cute but modifications may be needed,"As other reviewers have noted, this item is intended for old-fashioned faucets that don't have a shower diverter. I purchased this product knowing we would have to make modifications. We simply removed the diverter, drilled a hole in the top of the elephant's head, slid the elephant onto the diverter-less faucet and slid the diverter through the newly created hole into the correct place on the faucet. Aside from this, this is an excellent product. It is adorable and sturdy. My little girl is 14 months old and constantly pulls herself to standing in the tub. Not only does this prevent her from bumping/scraping her head on the somewhat sharp underside of the faucet, it gives her something sturdy to hold onto."
5,Wonderful Product,We had a difficult time getting it because of delivery complications but this is a great product. My daughter loves it so much we bought another one as a gift for a friend!
2,I should have paid attention to other reviews,"I was looking more for a spout protective cover than a bubble bath dispenser. I couldn't imagine the plastic would be very hard, but it truly would hurt just as bad as bonking your head on the faucet. I also don't want to caulk it. It's sitting in a box waiting for me to return it."
3,cute idea needs better execution,"I saw this product and thought it'd make a fun Christmas present for my daughter (21 mo) who loves animals. When she opened it, she was excited to use it. When trying to install it before her bath I had a little trouble getting it over the shower diverter pin, but once over it was very loose. It works okay with our bath faucet, but easily moves around which affects the spray of the water. When my 6 year old took it off the faucet, the ""rubber seal"" tore, but I don't think it really affects how it works."
4,falls off sometimes but overall really nice,i've only had it happen once but when i was running the water full blast the elephant came off. it's i nice piece to have so i don't have to worry about my baby knocking her head the water dispenset
5,Raymond Hu is a gift who has a gift,"Raymond Hu is a young artist who works in the medium of Chinese brush painting. His extraordinarily striking portraits of animals are wonders to behold, and the expressions these animals have and the cast of their eyes adds an unexpected dimension or ""soul"" to these portraits, and it's as though we've entered the spirit of the animal itself. I have friends who've gotten pages from Hu's book framed. This book cannot be recommended too highly."
2,Night Trilogy is better,"This is an author I hold with great respect. However, I must be honest in saying I had difficulty reading this book. I agree that it may be me, and not him, but I do feel his Trilogy to be much easier reading. This topic is one I feel very sympathetic with, but would strongly recommend his other books instead. (Now other readers, please please do not get upset, this is just my opinion, and in no way am I being disrespectful, as he is a master writer!)"
4,Enjoy reading!,It was a good book. It took me a couple chapters to get into it but then wanted to keep reading to see what happens next.
4,Interesting and informative read,"Australia is infamous for it's various animal introductions and their impact on it's native fauna and flora- in particular the cane toan and rabbit. Here is the fascinating history of the introductions that often went so wrong, and others which are deemed successful- such as cattle and sheep. Chapters cover 'cattle in colonies', 'horses in the colonies', 'acclimatisation societies', and various diseases encountered in the establishment of these species."
4,Typical rebranded pads,"Like other pads and helmets we've owned, the helmet is put together well, the pads do their job fine, but the stretchy velcro is going to fail someday this summer. Not unlike every single other stretchy velcro strap out there. They get frayed and the velcro gets worn. You're not going to find anything much better and besides they grow, right?"
2,Damia's Children,I had a hard time listening to this book. The narrater's voice is not one that keeps my attention nor does she have much excitement in her tone while reading. This not one I would recommend.
4,pretty good,Great book from a great series by a great author. She writes in a clear style that draws you in with intriguing story lines and appealing characters.
2,"Mushy, spotty plot with unoriginal characters","Disappointing story about Damia's children and their ""great"" exploits. The story tries to cover as much time and action as possible in as few a words as possible creating a disjointed and thin plot. It's even a bit hard to follow there are so many gaps; not one of McCaffrey's better works. And the anti-racial discrimination theme was tired and trite, a pale facsimile to Orson Scott Card's Ender series which is much better written and a bit more provocative. Too bad. It had potential."
1,Dreadful,"This books along with the latter talent books are so unrealistic as to be boring. The first talent books, Pegasus in Flight and Pegasus in Space were interesting and fun because we were reading about real characters.They had Talent, but they were still real people.The characters in the latter talent books are nothing less than gods, with an almost all-powerful Talent, and seemingly little or no personal problems or limitations (which makes th books dull). Also, what the books really portray, without actually saying it is basically a Talent autocracy. Non talented are inferior and unimportant, and the talented rule over everyone else with their powers. This reminds me of Star Trek, where everyone is law abiding, and the authority of the Federation is unquestioned.So what happens to those who question the authority of the Federation? They are automatically outlaws. Its really quite totalitarian.Anyway, this book is boring and not worth the money."
4,THIS IS HER BEST SERIES!,DAMIA'S CHILDREN IS ONE IN ANNE MCCAFFREY'S BEST SERIES. I HOPE SHE CONTINUES TO WRITE ABOUT THEM.
1,Why do you need this in a fighting game?,"Why on earth do you need a strategy guide for a fighting game? And don't tell me that it gives you all the moves, pause the game and you can get a list of all the moves! I own this guide, but only because it was given to me by someone else who got it for free from a store that couldn't sell it. It is terrible, and it doesn't tell you anything interesting, or that any half-brained moron couldn't find out for themself by pressing buttons."
3,Peg it boards,"My 18 month old played with a similar product at his Library classes and loved it. This one however is a bit hard to put the pegs in the holes (it isn't created for a toddler, so I guess this is expected). The only ""problem"" I see with it is that the boards smell very strongly of plastic. It's a very strong odor - after 1 month it still lingers on."
4,Very good but,"It is very good and wholesome, unfortunately , it has flaxseed oil and my cat is highly allergic to it. It makes her very itchy :( therefore I had to take her off of it. Sadly there aren't many choices of wholesome foods that don't have flaxseed or flaxseed oil."
3,Slow....,"I already had the scale, which is a good tool.The auto-dispenser is pretty good, but the interface seems years old technologically speaking. Power dispensing is accurate, but the cycle time is waaaay slow due to the dispenser displaying count, load, etc after every powder dump. Hitting the zero button will usually bring it back to the present, but having to do so is a pain in the buttt. I can go faster dumping the powder manually and then trickling up to final weight by hand.Also, transferring unused powder back to the original container seems to be a design afterthought."
3,This is only half of what you need.,This product is only the dispenser and would require the #1500 acale to be complete. I suppose that you could use *any* scale (I can't be sure of that) but the 1500 scale and the 1500 dispenser give each other feedback so that the metering is more precise. Other sites say that the unified pair are good for accuracy above 25 gr and so slow with pistol loads that you can easily do it faster by throwing your own with a manual dispenser.
4,Pioneer Girl by a Caswell,I am a Caswell and that is why I bought this book it told of bygone days of the pioneers and about the Caswell family.Very interesting.
3,sent me wrong color,The product works okay. Directions could be more clear. The tape they gave to secure the grips is crap. I got a pink and black pair instead of the red and black. The grips themselves work well and are comfortable.
2,Pink,"This was dissapointing, i was expecting it to be RED and black checkered pattern as the title says but it was like pinkish/magentaother than that there.. ok."
5,Endless Forms Most Beautiful Review,"For a large part of the 20th century, zoologists thought every type of animal had a unique set of genes, the genes that made rabbits give birth to baby rabbits, or that made grasshopper eggs hatch grasshopper nymphs. Instead, Sean B. Carroll tells us, in his charmingly offhand style, animals turn out to share great numbers of genes. In particular, we share master genes, the ones responsible for controlling embryological development. These master genes have been highly conserved for hundreds of millions of years, have passed into both great branches of animals, and have been central to the evolution of what Darwin called, ""endless forms most beautiful."""
2,science reader,"Too technical for the average reader. One gets lost part way through. It is obviously well researched, supported by other research and seemingly very thorough, but it comes across as having built an exquisite ocean liner that sinks the moment it sets sail. I agree with the other reviewer, Dr. Carroll speaks of evolution, argues strongly for it, yet uses the word design over and over again and never ever explains how this toolbox evolved. Why wouldn't the hand, the paw and the fin come from the same genetic area? That doesn't prove evolution and the book doesn't prove it, either. Had he written this was a pro-Intelligent Design book, he would have received more stars from this reader."
5,Sean Carroll has done it again,"This is a fantastic read; informative, yet laid-back enough to make it easy to digest. Carroll has a way of integrating just enough humor to keep you interested, without going overboard. If you're super science-savvy, you may be a bit bored in a few places where he goes over the basics of DNA structure, etc., but the fact that he starts at the bottom makes his books suitable for a much broader audience. If you want a good popular-science style read, this is your book."
3,Endless Details Most Boring,"I confess that I'm rating my interest more than the book itself. While the title (taken from Darwin's writings) is eloquent, the contents are dry and tedious. I'm sure people in the field of EVO DEVO get excited about this stuff, in the same way an archeologist can spend all day brushing a few centimeters of dirt off an artifact at a dig site. The basic premise that a few simple rules (the same gene toolkit) can account for the multiplicity of life forms is interesting. The story reminds me of the old biology mantra: ""Ontogeny recapitulates Phylogeny."" I just got somnumbulized by the detail that seemed more suited for a textbook. It's no stroll through Jurrasic Park; more like a lecture on fruitfly anatomy."
4,Kindle edition has some issues,"This review is for the Kindle edition of the book, and addresses only issues with that edition.While I greatly enjoyed the content of the book, the Kindle edition has some drawbacks, as at least one other reviewer has pointed out. The figures in the book appear to be grainy, barely legible scans of the print edition, and the color plates are inserted randomly in the middle of the book, nowhere near the text that refers to them and not linked to in any way, making it difficult to follow much of the discussion in chapter 4. Initially I thought they were completely omitted, but then I stumbled upon them later. Readers of the Kindle edition should be aware that they are located on page 182.I've given this edition 4 stars instead of 5 for that reason."
4,Sometimes nature's monsters are a step forward?,"The point of this sort of approach to evolutionary theory is thatdevelopments like mammals were due to the extremes of selectionbrought on by mass extinctions. We only have theories about what caused these extinctions periodically in the fossil record, but we do know that the next generations after them were very much different than what prevailed before. The ""monsters"" of one era became the new kings in the next.In nature there is a certain dominance by numbers: for a quarter of a million of years Neanderthals by being bigger and mostly smarter dominated the hominid evolutionary tree over the smaller more delicate modern human type, but an ice age brought that to an end.The ""evo devo"" ideas are that sometimes forms that are outside the normal genetic range are nature's new inventions for the strange new future."
3,Super info - ok writing,"This book is so full of interesting, amazing information - but the writing is very, very dry. I loved ""Your Inner Fish"" which overlaps the content of this book, but is much more engaging."
2,Endless Forms was endlessly over my head.,"Carroll did his best to bring break-through, gene level evolutionary science down to my level of comprehension. I'm afraid I just didn't measure up. As an interactive breather, he often paused before a big brainy ah-ha moment and stated, ""...that's right, you've probably already guessed the answer to this one...."" Well, I never did... not once! To state the obvious, Endless Forms was endlessly over my head. I love the mere topic of evolution, so with an open slack jaw, I numbly chugged through it. Regardless, I love his title, ""Endless Forms Most Beautiful"" a quote from mister big, Dr. Darwin himself."
3,Interesting but.......,"It could have told us more about Bill Lipscomb, perhaps tell us a bit more about his family and childhood. It seems there was so much more to this maniac then the reader found out. But other then that, the book was pretty good."
1,"Clue From the Grave, by Irene Pence","This ""true crime"" (actually, a tad unbelievable) SHOULD NOT have contained photographs of the crime victim. I could not believe the victim's family had approved this; extremely inappropriate, I believe. The content was a bit haphazard. To me, the chronology appeared to be off in places - confusing. References to U.S. Air Force protocol, for the most part, were hard to believe( I have served in USAF)."
2,This book is hard to understand for the average student.,"This book was given a poor rating by me because it has very few, and very poor examples. It is not a good book to learn from"
2,Geln Campbell,"There must be 45 songs on these 2 CDs. The vast majority are obscure and unheard of. This wasn't the ""greatest hits"" album I expected."
4,A great change of pace,"Fun game, difficulty level is up to you. Nice change of pace to the prominent War Movie genre that has taken over the industry in past 3 years...It's also a change from HALO/AdventRising, which makes it refreshing...A great RENT... not a purchase (too short and no replay value if you do it right the first time since there is no time limit to storyline)"
3,what the heck,"I have played and beaten this game a couple of times, and have to say it is a good shoot and run game. you have a story line to follow and a few good side missions to keep you busy. the story line is short I think and the side missions easy, but what I hate about this game is the fact that you are suppose to get certain items for finishing the side missions. well you get the items but not during the game. BUT AT THE END OF THE GAME. you get cool items like the cannon gun that shoot cannon balls, a horse that dosnt get tired or dosnt get killed, but like I said you get them at the end of the game. The game is over so you are rideing this new horse and shooting cannon balls at nothing no one to shoot at and nothing to do. and start a new game want help cant take the items with you. when you start a new game you start from scratch. so overall a good fun game but no extras."
4,Any serious connoisseur of classic rock will love this album,"Elephant Mountain is a delicious mix of folk, jazz and blues. Of special note are ""Darkness, Darkness"" and ""On Sir Francis Drake."" All in all it is a mellow, folksy album, but at times the band works up a good, lathery rock-jazz froth. When I first heard the album I was rather surprised at the Youngbloods jam-ability. I had not expected such a willingness to improvise from the makers of a pop hit like ""Get Together."" This is a solid recording all the way through. I would liken the feel of this album to bands like early Marshall Tucker, Glass Harp, and maybe even Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young."
3,Good but not Great,"I was dissappointed with this CD, easy listening but also boring at times and nothing innovative here at all. Time has not been kind to this album."
3,"A good shave, but the price isn't quite right.","I have had a cool skin razor for several years and always liked it. I finally got around to replacing the heads, and the difference in shave quality was dramatic (my old blades were at least 5 years old). However, I only give this product three stars because the blade kit is expensive to replace yearly as recommended and only includes new blades, not an entire new blade assembly. I didn't expect this, but for $30 it would have been nice, especially since, as other reviewers have pointed out, the blades and assembly have a tendency to accumulate residue, particularly if you don't use the special Nivea shave cartridges. (I want to be able to use a big cheap can of Barbasol dam***!) Manufacturers are entitled to charge what they wish for their products, but I don't have to like it."
4,More of a review for Amazon,The Norelco shaver head replacements I ordered are pretty standard. The review I have is for Amazon - amazing! Cannot find these replacements in ANY store - Amazon to the rescue!!!! Thanks
4,Norelco replacment heads,I truly like my Norelco cool shave razor and the HQ177 heads that make it work.
1,better shave,just replace your shaving heads once or twice a year and you continue to get a easy smooth shave. also remember the shaving gel/lotion.
5,Really a good buy and the blades last a long time. I will buy it again.,The blades are good quality and have a good life using it every day. I will purchase it every time when replacements are required.
4,This shaver provides a very comfortable shave,"As long as I can continue to get replacement heads for the 7700 Series razor, I will use this razor. It's great for a ""tough beard/soft skin face"" such as mine."
3,"Good, not great.","I was originally given the Norelco razor as a gift. I kept it for a couple of years, enough to warrant the purchase of these replacement blades. Ultimately, the blade are fine, but as some men might experience, (especially those with coarse facial hair) will find electric razors/blades such as these to be uncomfortable. Additionally, I often had to reshave some areas with a manual razor to achieve the close shave I desired. Ultimately, electric razors are for some, but not all."
5,Outboard manual,"The manual is what I wanted however why it went from Richmond Va to N Carolina, back to Richmond, then to Maryland, then to me in Chesapeake Va (90 miles away) is beyond me."
2,Wasnt' What I Expected,"when i opened the package i was expecting an assortment of drum stick wraps...cause that is what the picture is. What i got was single package with a design that wasn't even pictured in the ad, wraps for two sets of sticks. It was disappointing. I thought i would get the green ones plus the rest. I think i paid shipping so around 11 dollars for this and its not worth it. I would send it back if it didn't take so much work."
4,Foam Tack Glue,I used this in combination with the Foam Nails to glue together two foam tunnels entrances. Worked like a charm. Would buy again from seller. A+++
1,I believe it's Elmer' Glue...not foam glue,"Not worth the money $$, it is the equivalent of Elmer's Glue in a different bottle! This is not special foam glue."
1,Do Not Order Unless You Plan on using ALL of them within a few months.,"Expiration Date is a few months away. I purchased these to REFILL a few first aid kits. Looks like i'll need to replace the Advil in a few months. Save your money, order from someone else. I should have known better when the description said 'not returnable'. Shame on me."
2,Received old stock,"Ok, it's now 8/12 and the product expires 9/13. Guess that says it all. If this was fresh stock, it would have a shelf life of three or more years. Back it goes and I will not order from these guys again. Caveat emptor."
5,An unforgettably exotic expedition into the high Andes,"In this unbelievably lush and haunting CD, Miss Sumac unfolds the saga, in song, of an Inca Princess and Virgin of the Sun who falls in love with a mere mortal and is cast out to wander the mountains singing of her love. The songs are in Quechua, language of the ancient Incas and Spanish. One does not have to know either of these languages, though, as her vocal artistry surpasses all boundaries, even that of mortality. This can be viewed as the companion album to ' Voice of the Xtabay', which is also chilling and unforgettable."
3,A NOVELTY,Yma Sumac's range is impressive but I find her music boring.After listening to 2 or 3 songs----they all sound the same.After the 4th it all sounds like noise to me.I think of Sumac as a novelty.
2,S0-So viewer,It beats sitting in a tree with a big bird suit on waiting for birds to come and say hi.
2,Carson Bandit 8x25 Quick-Focus Monocular,I am a bit disappointed. I wanted a unit with a short range view but at the same time a little more magnification.It is convenient to carry and hold which is a plus for the device.
5,Pretty much agree with everybody else has said.,The value of the optics is there. It is easy to digest the focus. For $20 it is an effective and quality value
3,good buy,"Nice shape, easy to hold. Great for onsale price. Focus level a little tricky to work but, overall, nice buy."
4,Great for the price,"I didn't really understand how to hold this item at first, but when I realized how it became very comfortable and easy to use. I love how this comes in a little leather-feeling pouch so that it doesn't get scratched up. I kind of got this as a novelty so even though it doesn't zoom very far, it is still a cool little product. It made an awesome stocking stuffer for my boyfriend."
2,Limited,"I would not recommend this for a serious hunter, maybe someone walking through the park. Spend the extra money and get something better if you need to see widdlife up close and personal."
3,"A little good, a little bad....","My overall reaction to this CD is one of disappointment. There are positive attributes: I like the selection of songs, for instance, and the King's Singers do have lovely voices. However, I prefer folk music ""straight-up"",simple, and sincere. The first adjective that springs to mind when listening to this CD is OVER-ARRANGED! Too many la-la-la's and tum-ta-tum's, too much chiming in, too much determined effort to work harmonies into each song, all leading to an effect of sameness. I would prefer more solo efforts, duets ,some songs devoted to highlighting the contraltos, some the tenors, etc - just not all voices on all tracks....."
4,Not their best but I still like it,"I wasn't too thrilled with some of the arrangements.* Several of them tried so hard to be dramatic that they detracted from the music. In particular, the Skye Boat Song arrangement is gorgeous in places, but in other places you just want to take arranger John Rutter aside and tell him ""It's a good song, stop changing it""* I have heard another King's Singers arrangement of Danny Boy that I liked better.* I didn't think that the solo voice towards the beginning of Annie Laurie worked well.It's a good mix of songs: fast, fun songs like Mairi's Wedding and What Shall We Do With The Drunken Sailor, slow lyrical songs such as The Ash Grove and Scarborough Fair. Almost all of the songs are well known, save Going To Towyn and Eriskay Love Lilt.Best tracks on the CD: Ar Hyd Y Nos and The Ash Grove. Also worth mentioning: Greensleeves and Mairi's Wedding."
4,Good overall,"last christmas is alright to me but ""Everything She wants"" was the Jam especially the long version.it still sounds good.Good Compilation overall though."
4,Great CD!,"This CD is for fans who loves the song by Wham!, Last Christmas but find it hard to get these days in stores."
3,"it's only contains of two the same track, only for the real fans of wham should have this collection","it's only contains of two the same tracks, so i think this single cd just only for the real fans of wham."
