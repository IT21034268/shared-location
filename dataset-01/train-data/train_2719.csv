3,You have got to be kidding,"""""It would be one thing to competently reproduce others past glories but what really puts the Crowes in the same category as the Beatles and Stones is the quality of their own material.""""- Good grief, you have got to be kidding.If anything, the Crowes are the poor man's Tragically Hip. (very poor man's, that is). Comparing the Crowes output to the Beatles and Stones is ludicrous and a joke.Give them an A for arrogance, though.Fans of this would be better off checking out the Tragically Hip's live concert DVD - 'That Night In Toronto.' As opposed to copying the Faces and Stones circa 1971 as the Crowes built a career on, the Tragically Hip, coming from the same roots, is entirely original.This DVD is ok. Unfortunately some great playing is marred by pointless off-stage amateurish videography of Crowes members walking around in the streets of San Fran. Gosh, how exciting.Not."
5,Food for your soul....,"It is impossible to put into words where the Crowes fit into the history of Rock & Roll, and that's mainly because there's never been anyone who does EXACTLY what they do.From the liner notes:""""It would be one thing to competently reproduce others past glories but what really puts the Crowes in the same category as the Beatles and Stones is the quality of their own material.""This DVD will make you feel good - it's just that simple. I can't believe you can get this much value for $10. The band could have charged 3 times that, and I wouldn't have blinked an eye. Everyone is in top form on this disc, and the performances are incredible. This band can make even the most grizzled and jaded music listener smile from ear to ear. Buy the disc, and then go see them live - it will change your life."
3,Good concert,"Finally, we have some Black Crowes on HD! The concert has some great number and it's definetly worth picking up if your a Crowes fan and you have a decent sound system. By warned, it's only maxes out at 1080i, not 1080p, but its not a huge deal."
3,Should have been much better.,"Great show put on by an awesome band. The problems are with the production. The sound is mediocre at best. The mix is poor with the band sounding muddy. The 5.1 is unlistenable with muddy instruments coming at you loudly from behind. It doesn't help that they chose to use regular Dolby and DTS rather than a lossless HD codec. All in all, it's a great show ruined by a producer who should be hung by his nutsac! Worth having, just not nearly as good as it should have been..."
3,This could have been so much better,"The video portion is great, but there is something amiss in the DTS, 5.1 Surround and Stereo sound. The mix doesn't sound quite right to me. The bass guitar is almost completely drowned out by the mike on the bass drum in the first few numbers. Not until 'My Morning Song' do I hear a definable bass line. Especially in the louder, faster numbers, all I can hear is the 'thump thump' of the bass drum. If you have a good subwoofer it becomes almost hard to listen to. In some of the softer passages you can hear the bass guitar a little better, but there's just not enough separation between all of the instruments in my opinion. I can't believe I'm the only one who's noticed this.Follow-up to the above review: After watching it again it becomes clear that one of the crew has recognized this problem and stuffed a towel into the offending bass drum during 'My Morning Song'. There's even a shot of the towel as the boys perform the song. The rest of the concert is fine."
2,weak effort...........,"In general, The Black Crowes performance here sounds bloated and weak. Lots of instruments (too many?) but not nearly enough attitude and aggression for a rock band. Way too laid back and relaxed...very little excitement. Also, I can't prove it, but it sounds like Chris Robinson might be singing out of his nose rather than his mouth.Bad idea #1: filling the video with ""home movie"" scenes of the band in San Francisco.low recommendation............."
3,"What is he singing? Is that why its called ""into the fog""...????","I really like the Black Crowes (e.g. via compact disc), so this Blu-ray disc comes as a surprise...a disappointment actually. For one thing, I defy anyone to understand a single word the lead is singing...the mix is that poor. The lead singer's vocals should be upfront with the band behind it, and not the other way around. The video quality is good, but the video production values are mediocre. This appears to have been a low budget, thrown together effort. The Black Crowes, a super band, deserve better than this. So do you."
1,Worthless,"Zero stars is more like it. No matter what I did in the way of configuration, it would not work. I have wasted nearly a week of my time trying to get this piece of junk to hold a configuration, to no avail. Finally, my frustration with it grew so intense that I took it to my garage and ""fixed"" it with a mallet. I can assure you, it will not be giving anyone else problems. Avoid at all costs."
1,Horid,a horid thing thats incompatable with anything unless you know how to change its subnet which is impossable.
1,Not even worth 1 star....,"It is 4AM and I have been up since 8 this morning taking a day off to get my home networl set up. I have spent hours on the phone with support and the bottom line is that this is a lemmon and it is very apparent that Linksys went to market with an un-tested product... The installation wizard CD does not work, there is not one substitute on line and you can not even downloaded it from their support site???? I only know 2 other frineds that have purchased linksys and they both had to return theirs... o for 3... How rediculous"
4,Can't understand the problems others are having,"This is my second one of this model, I burned up the first myself when we moved and I accidentially plugged the wrong transformer into it (too much voltage = smoke). I found it easy to configure, set up WEP keys, MAC locked everything using the web-based interface. It worked great with our LinkSys Media extender - we watch recorded tv from our Media Center pc on our plasma screen tv three rooms away using this device. No problems whatsoever. Hasn't slowed down my internet connection either. I am buying another one today to serve the mobile computer lab at work."
1,Looks to be a lemon,"I purchased this unit along with 3 WMP55AG PCI cards to integrate into my current home network. Moderate web browsing with this unit appears to be okay, however once a heavy network load it placed on the WAP55AG it stalls, locks up, and requires a power cycle. I'm using heavy loosely here. Downloads from Windows Update over a 1.5Mbps cable modem have caused this behavior. Copying a file a local wired server to a wireless client causes this behavior all the time.I've been in contact with Linksys tech support for a few days now. So far none of their 'workarounds' have been successful.[...]"
1,Cut my Internet Speed to 30%,I bought this to upgrade my wireless connection to my Xbox 360. The Wireless connectivity was passable (not great) but what ultimately made me return this was after multiple tests I determined that the router had cut my connection speed to a third of its original speed. I tried to trouble-shoot w/ Linksys Tech Support to no avail.
1,Avoid this product,"I have had the unfortunate experience of dealing with 3 of these at the office. Each one is plagued with the activity lights flashing constantly when there are no other wireless devices in range. (flashed to the latest firmware) I tried multiple locations, even going as far to bring one home and see what happened. I live the middle of no where, so I am sure there are not any wireless devices around. Also, the fact that neither 802.11a or 802.11g would keep a constant 54m connect. Sitting the laptop 1 foot from the router and the speed would fall back to lower connect speeds constantly. After trying multiple wireless lan cards, and multiple laptops, I can honestly say this AP is a piece of garbage and I would not recommend it at all."
1,Read All Reviews,"I bought this thinking that M. Caine could do not wrong. I was wrong! The film is terrible. Nothing redeeming... the photography is bad - stilted [looks like home video], the dialogue is trite, the actor walk thru the parts and even St. Petersburg is not covered until the finishing credits... if you last that long.... really bad... save your money and if you want to see a good film of this genre buy The Ipcress File or any other M. Caine film...."
5,Revealing,"I realize this is hard for people to accept as truth because most of us have not experienced such horrible things, but we must know that things are out there that we ""just can't believe"" and equip ourselves for those things. She gives a wonderful written testimony which I will gladly tell others to read and be on guard and PRAY, PRAY PRAY."
5,Great Service and Excellent Condition.,"The seller was very prompt in getting this book out to me. In fact, it came sooner than I expected. Thank you.I have heard Johanna speak, what a graceful and eloquent woman. Thanks for getting this one to me so quickly."
1,Lies,"This women has no idea what she is talking about. Her evidence is simply false. For example, the idea that people who play role-playing games (D&D) eat babies and drink human blood is absurd. Paranoid trash. This book should be insulting to intelligent Christians."
1,What is wrong with this guy?,"Have any of you done research into these claims? These are total and complete lies. Aside from that, the book was ok, but being filled with malicious and pointless untruths kind of lowered my rating. My only regret is that I can't give it 0 stars. One will have to do"
4,"""Come to Papa.""","Despite its suggestive title, this is actually a mystery/thriller and a very good one. Richard and Priscilla are a happily-married couple who have new neighbors, Eddy and Kay. Eddy is a bit unscrupulous and a little strange, yet he works very hard to establish a tight friendship with Richard. Richard is shocked when Eddy suggests a wife-swap, but later thinks it might be fun.The first half is a rather typical suburban-marriage story, but before you know it, BAM! It turns into a scary murder story with twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. Kevin Kline gives a strong performance as mild-mannered Richard who thinks the grass is greener next door, but Kevin Spacey steals the show, as usual. He plays overly-friendly Eddy, gradually becoming the kind of raving psychopath that Spacey plays so well.There are many plot holes that make the story more than a little far-fetched, but still I enjoyed it and recommend it for those who like thrillers."
4,really liked movie,i really did enjoy this movie. it was a whole other side of kevin spacey that only remined me of the movie [ seven] i did buy the movie because kevin spacey was in it. but the whole cast ' they all were really good. a5 STAR MOVIE ..././.
5,5 STARS FOR KEVIN SPACEY: ACTOR EXTRAORDINAIRE,"I think this could have been a better movie with a deeper plot but what does keep it moving is... Kevin Spacey. He is such a fabulous, fabulous actor!! Kevin Kline - though usually so good, is unfortunately SOOO bland in this movie. Very poor acting on his part.It was really disgusting. Kevin Spacey is the only class act in this movie and makes it worth watching."
5,Great resource to get you going on road block days..,Ever have days where you just don't feel creative? This book offers quick ideas that will get you over that stump or help a beginnner get going. Well worth the price.
2,A thriller that does not thrill,"This is why I'd never heard of this movie before, even though I'm sort of a movie buff. It pretty much sucks. The first part is slow and boring, a few slasher scenes notwithstanding. Michael Biehn turns in a poor performance, and neither the killer nor his kiddie apprentice are believable at all. There's just too little evil in the killer. The rest of the film is mostly predictable and like the setup, really needed some good editing (and acting, and scripting, and everything)."
1,Awful Film,"Just when you think the horror industry cannot possibly find a way to release a more grotesque torture film, they do it. This is in no way creative, scary, or imaginitive. Just a high body count, and people being needlessly butchered. The film does not connect to the audience in any way, the story is boring, and everyone gets slaughtered when they are in helpless positions. Nobody even attempts to fight back, thus there is no suspense. Back in 1999, Stir Of Echoes, Blair With Project, Sixth Sense were all released in the same summer. Oh how the genre has fallen since that time.On a bright note, films like this one, ""Open House,"" and ""Funny Games"" are actually SO bad that it might convince producers to stop making these types of movies....but as long as people keep forking over money to see them, they will be made. Don't pay to watch this!"
2,Below average slasher flick,"I found this to be very slow moving. The main focus is on a young woman who has to move to the country to live with her uncle's family when her parents die. Interspersed with that is the evil guy who has abducted a young boy, and who likes to hang women up in his workshop and torture and kill them. Eventually the two plot lines converge, but by the time this happened I was to bored to care.This might be worth watching if it shows up on your streaming video service and there's nothing else to watch. Otherwise I would recommend skipping it. If you like this type of movie, there are a lot better choices."
3,Where the gore at fool,"Okay, I may have misinterpreted other reviews, but one shadow stabbing another shadow is not gorey, is it? It seems almost censored. This is NOT FRIGHTENING. It is suspenseful. If that's what you like, you'd probably prefer a better plot, or better acting on the part of the serial killer, one of the main roles. What irritates me most about this movies though is what bothers me for all generic horror movies. That is... the women screaming, they all seem like the same person with differnt faces. Their whining and wailing after beening tied up for days seems very implausible. What would be plausible, go into shock I'd think. What he does is not much different from crucifixion without the nails, thus shock. But not so shocking. Their justification for him killing women is so absurd, it's hysterical. You can't take this movie seriously on many levels. Highly overrated"
4,Thrilling,When a boy who feels no pain is taken by a deranged stranger he is the perfect student for this mad killer. Teaching him how to kill and torched his victims the boy soon grows and try's to escape. A great story and effects a movie you wont forget
2,Poor story,"Ineffective storyline plods along from scene to scene of gratuitous torture and murder. A crazy guy's occassional delusions passes for character development. As in many films of this nature there are very attractive women, cast as victims, and they do dumb things that put them in absurdly dangerous situations. In one scene a victim's foot flail's uselessly around the perp's head begging more than the obvious question of why doesn't she kick him in that peanut head-- rather how did the actress AVOID kicking the guy in the head.I did not like the movie."
2,Disappointing,"I went into this 1 watching with an open mind, even though these slasher type of movies don't do much for me. There was a lot of hype surrounding this one, sadly that's all it was hype. It starts out pretty well but gorily. Sadly the meandering story goes nowhere, never really develops plot, or the characters into someone who you care about. Then it mindlessly digresses into a mindless slashfest, with no heart. Horrible, predictable, and utterly boring to me. Anyone can film a bloody mess, it takes talent to make it into an interesting story with characters you care about. Gave it an extra star for the pretty girl, thats about it. Don't pay to see this movie."
4,Do you like to be shocked?,"A young boy is taken from his home by a madman and is forced to watch and even partake in violent crimes. This movie is for those of you who like your heart pumping and aren't looking for two hours of serenity for your evening. You could say that scenes in this movie are more distrubing than scary, but that is what gives this movie its luster. Not your typical Hollywood ending I might add."
3,WEIRD ENDING,"In rural Pennsylvania a psychopath (John Savage) kidnaps a young boy and cuts him. The boy has a medical condition where he does not feel pain, which the psycho mistakes for ""no fear."" In awe the psycho make Martin (Spencer List) his apprentice, picking up women that no one seems to know is missing.Nearby, Allison (Alexandra Daddario) moves in with her uncle following the death of her parents. She jogs past the abandoned building where the psycho lives and she becomes curious...The acting was about what you would expect for a ""B"" horror movie. There is stabbing and blood, but there lacks a certain horror aspect as we don't know most of the victims. I thought I had the movie figured out, but the ending came off as a surprise. The movie sets up for a sequel. Not the worst horror film out there, it just lacks character.Language and brief corpse nudity."
2,If you like boring scary movies...,"This movie is so repetitive and unoriginal. I'd give it one star but that is like giving 0 stars in my opinion (since one star is mandatory). Some of the acting was ok, so it gets 2 stars. Seriously though, skip this movie. I kept zoning out and dozing off until I heard the screaming; the same thing kept happening over and over again. It's one of those movies where the foreshadowing is so pointless because without it you already know what's going to happen, so you can't really be surprised, only annoyed that they thought this was actually going to be engrossing."
1,Not a horror gem,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I make it a point of watching low budget b movies. I expected a bad movie, lousy dialogue, bad acting. But this was just an excuse to show the torture of young women. A good horror movie, does a little more than just show degradation. No suspense, no tense moments. Obvious ending. I can't believe I wasted time watching this drivel."
3,Small story: B-Horror,"This story is low on the horror, high on the gore.Strange on the morality, even the folks who don't smoke or have sex end up poorly.The acting was okay. The cinematography was not so bad. The story was rural, limited, and the set up for a sequel is weak at best.I cannot recommend this movie."
2,A Disappointing Pre-quel,"I was not sure what to expect from this film, but even without high expectations, I found myself disappointed. This struck me as nothing more or less than a run-of-the-mill slasher film, purporting to explain the development into a young serial killer of an innocent 5 year-old boy who is abducted from his back yard.I found the film unremarkable in every dimension - writing, production values, acting."
5,Best I've found....,this is the best conditioner I have sound for my unruly hair it detangles nicely smells great and has a nice feel. I can even use a little bit as a leave in conditioner!
1,Deaf KIDS,How can you do a report on DEAF KIDS and forget to include CLOSED CAPTIONING??? Really?????--- I have a DVD if you want it! It's worthless to me:(
3,Can find most of this information on the Internet now,"When this book was written in 2004, it probably was a good book to read but now you can find most of this information very easily on the web. However, the book still does have some advice that is still valid especially around the market. If you followed the advice about setting stop losses for your portfolio, you would have saved yourself quite a bit of pain in 2008."
5,Best for most everyone,"While other books are more technical about various markets, this book provides the fundamental reasons for changes in stock, currency, interest rate, real estate, commodity and other markets. Even more important, there are simple, workable strategies that anyone can use for a few minutes a week to beat 80% of the professional money managers and 90% of the people who invest. You can use it to manage your 401k, and any other portfolio, large or small. Best of all, it provides simple concepts and tactics for becoming financially free! The secret to success--""how much to risk""--is presented clearly and quickly (something you'll never see from any other author). There are references to many other resources, almost all of them free. Since there are so many investment secrets, I hope people don't follow the advice and strategies in this book, because it will be that much easier for those of us who do."
1,Sjuggerud financial advice sucks,"I subscribed to his newsletter, ""True Wealth"", for 2 years, and I'd say about half of his recommendations turned a (modest) profit. Caveat empor: Despite assurances that his recommendations were ""no brainer"" decisions, his investments are very risky, and I benefitted very little from all his words of wisdom."
3,Quick Read - Mostly Photos,Don't purchase the book if you expect a highly detailed technical manual (such as the Star Trek Technical Manuals). The book is layed out between concept art drawings and movie stills showing the final product. What was interesting was to see some products that were designed but not used (I assume since at the time of this writing I haven't seen the movie yet).In addition there's a running conversation between Lara and Bryce (her high tech provider) that provide the text of the book. Not much there.Quick read. In the end it's mostly eye candy than anything else.
1,Considerable dissapointment,"I read this book and kept expecting to see diagrams and descriptions of things that nobody else but the Countess could possibly have had, some of the unusually high-tech equipment that she used in the film, the highly specialized things reminiscent of Batman. But her high-tech binoculars and her high-tech piton pistol were NOT SHOWN. There were only things like her .45-caliber pistols. I mean, come on! I can identify the *gunsmith* already. There was nothing particularly unusual about them, one can even get them as toys! Why would anyone be particularly interested in them? Then there was her run-of-the-mill BORING BORING huge Land Rover. Pfagh! A sop to the foolish masses who are interested in accursed immoral *monster trucks*! A gas mask. Gas masks are not unusual. A stupid, unrealistic robot. A security system. What is interesting or unusual about a security system? Gloves, boots, *clothing*? I have no interest in what clothing the Countess chooses to wear."
3,Preaching to the Converted,"Professor Whitaker is a polemical writer. He is a man with a passion!For those of us frequently angered and sometimes amused by rampant Political Correctness he offers some fresh perspectives. Unfortunately in many places the book is irritatingly repetitive. Identical, or near identical sentences frequently follow each other within a paragraph or two. This is relieved somewhat by breaking the book into 6 themed Parts, each part consisting of many short, easily absorbed, single issue chapters.I doubt that the book will convert anyone but it does provide some good material for those brave souls prepared to fight the cruel absurdities that are helping to debase our civilization."
1,Seems pretty whiney,"I only read the description but it sounds like some guy whining because other people whine too much. I'd like to show this author the back of my hand - no I wouldn't but he should make the book cost more if he wants people to take him seriously - 23 bucks is a good paperback cover price for people to start to believe you aren't a hack. Also, Johnny can't think, most likely, because he's dumb as a bag of hammers - most people, myself included, are, you know. There's no shame in it."
2,"The good, the bad and the ugly","The good song is ""Inside and Out""The bad song is ""Match of the day""The ugly song is ""Pigeon""The only good track is also on the ""Archives vol II"" so don't spend your money is this EP."
4,Couldn't put it down,"The Celtic Heart is an epic tale set in the first century AD, in a Celtic tribe off the coast of England. This fantasy book keeps you engaged, and I felt it difficult to put the book down after finishing a chapter. The images are vivid and I feel extremely knowledgeable about the Celtic people of that time, their religions, rituals and moral values. This is my favourite type of book - an absorbing novel with historical significance from which I really feel as though I have learnt something important."
2,"Really cute looking, but doesn't really help me","Sure, the screen looks pretty and the graphics are very eye-pleasing, but it doesn't make sense. Not logically orientated for the needs of a classroom teacher. It tries to be all things to all people, when most of us just need a solid gradebook and scheduling application. Bit of a disappointment and not really worth the price."
1,Don't bother.,"This product does not meet the needs of a teacher. Also, the support didn't exist. I waited five days for an email reply to a question. On top of that, it took five weeks to complete the refund process, which made me nervous because of the 30-day money-back guarantee. Try Class Action."
4,"Awsome, pricey, fragile","The gauge is easy to use, and easy to read. Get the rubber/plastic protector, though, if you don't want it to wind-up broken."
3,wasn't what I was looking for,The video wasn't what I was looking for and returned the video. Had virtually nothing about drugs and substance abuse.
3,Not very appropriately titled,"A better title would have been ""The Madness of Komeda."" This lot are so strange that I think I would think twice about letting them into my home to use the toilet...I'm afraid they would paint it green or blow it to pieces. The lyrics are silly...it sounds like their grasp of English on this outing was tenuous at best, and some of the songs are so unbelievably silly, I can't listen to it with a straight face. My friends all hate it, and there are only three songs on it that I like myself. It's just too strange for me. Often these sorts of adventurous voyages into the world of odd instrumentation leave me cold rather than excited, and this album is a perfect example of very ambitious songwriting and arranging going irritatingly wrong."
5,Keith Sweat - Jazz,This was a great cd from the beginning to the end. Keith Sweat is one of my favorites of all time and he does not disapoint at all...Great cd!!!!!
3,1 out of 2,"Somewhere along the line, Dr. JT decided he was a 'musician'.... wrong! Like with most of his discs, something just goes terribly wrong.. and I have a hard time stomaching them in full. Honestly, I love most of his work.. as it is quite effective, but lately (as with this album) he tosses in some 'out of nowhere, unwanted, and unwelcome melody or strange synth stab. These always take you completely out of your meditation and in some cases startle you. The melodies are just.. goofy. Stick with te ambient space doc.. its all good. First track on this album is pretty effective and mellow, and I do recommend.. the second, barf!"
3,Prison/juvenile detention drama which starts to wear a bit thin before it wraps up,Fine performances and well realized characters in a prison/juvenile detention drama which unfortunately starts to wear a little thin before it wraps up.
2,Didn't work on exhaust manifold.,"Followed the directions exactly, but the stuff still blistered off the metal within a few days. Was a waste of time and money, but you might have better results under different circumstances."
5,ABBA the Great,"what can one say ... ABBA, even more than quarter of a century after their desolution, still be the best. i can't say if it is the original Swedish songs or the English or the spanish ones that's the best version, or even some of the tracks are available in French and German.the thing with ABBA is that they have a track to accompany every mood that one be in. fast tracks, slow tracks, some when you in the mood, and some when you are down on your mood."
5,GF loved it,"So my gf loves Abba, and this was one of the few items that she didn't have, gave it to her as a birthday surprise, she loved it."
3,Larry Young's Laurence of Newark,Larry Young is a great keyboard player. I like Free Jazz & track 2 is pretty good. The other tracks are leaning much more to Jazz Fusion.
4,Nice to see some old faces,"I didn;t read this with alot of expectation. It's an interesting idea, but not alot of substance. Things seem to rushed in order to fit in more characters, and the point of the story kind of gets muddled. I really wished Claremont didn't constantly resurrect the Phoenix everytime he pens a story arc.That being said, its nice to see some old faces mixed in with newer characters. The art was very good. The premise was interesting and challenging to long-time fans."
4,"Good action, but hard to follow if you don't know the background","While this installment of the long-running X-Men saga is dynamic and contains a great deal of action, readers that are not familiar with the previous stories will find it very difficult to follow. The story is based in several locations and the contexts are complex. You need to understand the powers of the many X-Men characters, how they have interacted in the past, villains such as the Skrulls and Kree, the role of Charles Xavier and the continuing saga of the Phoenix.Fortunately, even if you do not understand the entire backdrop, the action is intense and the book ends with a major cliffhanger that leaves you frustrated. This is X-Men action at its' finest, where the heroes are forced to step up and defend Earth and themselves against mighty powers that want to sweep them away."
2,"Great Radio, terrible CD player","I bought this stereo from Best Buy during the beginning of September 2006. My mistake was thinking that this stereo would be as good as a similarly priced Sony stereo. Not true!At first, I loved this player; great controls, bright screen, lots of radio presets. It even promised to play mp3s. After about 45 days, it stopped playing CDs. I would put in a disc, factory compact disc, not a burned CDrom, and it wouldn't play. Best Buy stated it was a manufacturing problem and refused to refund me. Be warned, my stereo broke in less than two months. No more Dual products for me, ever! I ended up buying a JVC player as a replacement."
3,lolz!,Ima Barbie Girl! In a barbie world! You can comb my hair! Undress me anywhere! whoo! that is THE most fun song to dance to! i bought the cd just to play at my pool party!
3,Heater Core not as pictured but so far works fine,"Purchased this heater core ( and paid much more for it than other brands offered) because I was told it was made in the USA... I researched different brands for an entire day and was assured Omix-Ada was made in USA...When I received it stated on the box It is ""Made in MEXICO"" ...Also I liked that it had Brass tubing ( as shown in the picture )...WRONG again... the whole thing is aluminum including the tubing...Seriously considered sending it back but I needed it ( that is why I purchased it) and the shipping charges to and fro would have made it not worth returning...did install it and so far it is working.. for how long who knows... that is one of the reasons I like Made in the USA ... better chance of not having to do the job over again because of inferior product...Will update if / when I have any problems..."
4,Corticobasal Degeneration Source Book,"This is a good source book for researching this disease, although it is a bit out of date. I do think it is worthwile to get if someone you know is dealing with this disease. This book provides many different resources to get help and to become better educated,"
4,Great deal for your money!,"I bought this large jar because I use a lot of coriander in cooking. It is definitely a good deal. It is a little bit more coarse then I would like it to be, but still works as it should. Has a good smell. Lid is not very tight, so I had to transfer it into a different container.Overall - Good buy. Will purchase again."
3,"Not bad, but not the best fit","I purchased this and the Odyssey table for use at shows. The fit just seems a little off, but not too bad. The only real negative is that when unfolded the middle just does not seem to want to set up straight across. It's not really noticeable from the audience, but I notice it.Still, it is sturdy and travels well."
2,Sizing chart was too small,I ordered the size that was supposed to fit my dogs' necks. It didn't even come close to fitting - too small. It may be a useful product if it fits. I didn't return the products due to the return costs charged by the company. Suggestion: be generous in size when you order.
2,Not satisfied...,I loved my watch at first but somehow the face came loose and water got behind it (you can swim in shallow water). My watch is damaged now and won't work. The watch was very comfortable but not any good if it doesn't tell me the time. I'd buy another if I knew the one I got was just a lemon.
5,Useful book,As a car enthusiast I am continually in search of useful automotive literature. This is one of those books. It covers car management systems in a clear and informative way. This book is aimed more at the hobbyist rather than professional but a general uderstanding of how engines work is required.This book has helped me solve a few problems by placing the car management system into perspective. This is a highly recommended book.
2,Waste of money,"The title is very deceiving.More than 1/2 of the book is dedicated to ""project cars"" even though the title is How to tune & modify engine management systems .It briefly describes timing ,fuel, etc tables & was not much more informative than information found when searching on the internetDon't waste your money."
1,Does not cover engine Management System tuning,"This book is a great book for overview if you never knew how a car works. It's a great book for basics and has several projects that are glossed over. Its' got lots of great photos.Not one place does the book talk about Engine Management tuning. Fuel Maps, Ignition maps, what you are looking at, what they mean, basics like adjusting the 2bar spark map for turbo, etc... It talks a lot about history and products but does not cover what it says it does which is the actual engine management tuning. I strongly suggest looking elsewhere for a book if you actually plan on doing some ECM tuning or EMS tuning, this books does not even get you started on how to do it, it has lots of photos and history so you can sound like you know what you are talking about at the next car show, but nothing there to get your hands dirty.good for beginners not wanting to actually do tuning but understand the management systems."
5,The ultimate guide.,"It doesnt get any better than this! Another ""Motorbooks workshop"" series book.Its 270 pages in colour that explains in great detail engine management systems.There is at least one fault,its a bit too technical for some people but its still a great book.There are plenty of diagrams and photographs throughout.If you are building a street machine or hot rod and want to consider EMS instead of carby engines this book will explain it all."
1,Very disappointed Would love my money back,"Now How too? Waste of my time and money. Nothing on HPTuners,Doesnt explain how to adjust VE and the mafTrain wreck"
3,"Not bad, but...","I was disappointed in this book for a couple of reasons. One is that it wanders from the title topic regularly with many pages spent on fabricating intake manifolds and highlighting project cars. This is all interesting but will not help me tune my EFI system. The book would be less than half it's size if the author stuck to the stated subject. The other is the amount of repetition. It appears the book was written with the assumption the reader would skip around (and I can see why they would) but I tend to read cover-to-cover. Also, although the content on basic engine fuel and spark requirements is informative, there is no coherent tuning strategy presented. There is an abundance of information on aftermarket controllers which may be very useful if the reader is looking for this type of information. Overall, I cannot recommend this book for someone wanting to actually be able to tune their EFI system using it's contents."
5,another great Moosewood cookbook,I got this for my daughter who is gardening for the first time. It's a great book.
5,Moosewood Kitchen Garden,I bought this as a gift for a friend who loves the Moosewood cookbooks. This was a big hit. Very helpful while planning her garden.
3,"Nice voice, but just an average CD...","I purchased this CD after reading a couple of reviews of Ms. Cardone's work. Truthfully, this CD was just average to me. There are a couple of good songs, such as ""Hasta Siempre"", ""Antonio"", ""G Stories"" and ""Frederick"", and then there are the songs which just did not make an impression on me...I can't even remember the melodies for these songs! Nathalie has a good voice and the production is well done. It is an import so it's going to cost you a little more than if it were domestic...but I feel I did get my money's worth and I think it's a keeper rather than a recycle bin candidate."
4,Sexy French Singer Dominates During Spanish Songs,"The sexy Nathalie Cardone, native of Pau, France, makes her debut with this uneven album. The first two songs, Hasta Siempre and Mon Ange, are really nice, but the rest of the album is mediocre. However, with the state of modern pop music, this is an impressive first CD.Being an import, this is an expensive CD, but the first two songs make it worth it.P.S. See if you can find the sexy music video to Hasta Siempre. It is amazing!"
5,Nathalie Cardone,"Un excelente disco, rara la vez que me gusta un disco de otro idioma que no sea en español de principio a fin, pero este es la gran excepcion.Lo que me hace preguntarme por que Nathalie no siguio grabando mas discos??Muy recomendable... aunque no entiendan frances... despues de escuchar el disco correran en busca de un diccionario."
4,Colorful and emotional,Nathalie's performance in this CD is magnificent and sublime. I am delighted with the richness and emotion of most of the songs. The approach to one of Garcia Lorca's poems is one of the most georgeous elements of this CD.
3,It get's job done but..,"I guess I can't expect too much for money I spent but they could put little bit more time on cosmetic. If you don't mind how it looks, this is OK device"
1,not what i ordered,this was not the item i order....it was a gift so i did not see it before it was sent. when i went to my in-laws and they showed me the blanket i didnt let them know but i was very disappointed to realize it was not the picture of fenway that i had ordered and was on the website
5,Why didn't I think of this!,"Wow, what an incredible light. I bought one of these Wobble Lights and I am very impressed. You can bump (smash) into it and it bounces right back, it really takes a beating. Not only that, but it also is cool to the touch. I can't count how many times I have been burned by the old tri-pod style work lights. This is a great product that can be stringed together with several other Wobble Lights, female and male receptacle on each side of the light. I want more!"
4,"Classic, but I don't know. . .","Legends and Hero Tales. Picture book with early elementary looking print and picture.Beowulf is an old Scandinavian tale. At age 10, Beowulf killed a bunch of trolls who were bothering tourists. As he grew, he destroyed various sea serpents and monster. He was called to help defend a king from Grendel, a terrible monster. He cleverly did, ripping his arm off, so Grendel left and never came back.Simple pictures of the Vikings."
5,"Very good product, and interesting design choices that you won't see in other figures.","The figures do have limited motion ability compared to more recent products, but the quality and size comparison for the two more then make up for with the positions that are similar to those seen in A New Hope."
5,Great Rechargeable Battery Pack!,This product is perfect! You plug the cord directly into the Wii and recharge your Wii remote! No more wasting money on batteries! And the great thing about these rechargeable battery packs is they dont add any extra bulk to the Wii remote and those nifty little silicone covers fit over the battery and I just sliced out a little square to open up the charge receptor! These are great!
1,Worked less than 1 year,"These chargers did not even last a year..I tried everything but the charger must have fried the battery back..we got these for two of our remotes..the other two in a different charger work fine still, these won't even register..so I actually had to pre-order the new Energizer flat panel charger for 4 remotes...we are currently down two remotes until we get the new charger...not worth the money, very disappointed."
1,Won't charge,"Got the Wii and this battery for my kids for Christmas, and this rechargeable battery won't charge - despite leaving it plugged into my computer for days. Bogus!"
2,"Good idea, doesn't work well","I purchased two of these.PRO:* Good integration into the Wii controller* Fits under the new Wii rubber jacket* Convenient USP cables plug into the backof the Wii to recharge the batteries* Saves the environmentCON:* The Wii remote uses so much power that youhave to recharge these nearly every day.* These include an AAA size rechargable cell.The Wii uses AA batteries. This causes thisproduct to use up the charge too fast.Bottom line: The product works, but not well enough for a good recommendation."
3,kodak batteries,"The item that shows on the package is not exactly the same as the one that I got, but it works fine."
3,I ended up returning it...,"After reading the reviews I was really looking forward to reading this book, but ended up a bit disappointed. The editorial review and introduction lead me to believe that there was difficult material in the book, but I would be able to make my way through most of it.I came at the book with a computer science background (and no prior neural network experience) and found the material rather difficult to follow. The statistics and math needed to really follow the book was more than I expected.This doesn't mean the book is bad. After skimming through it a couple of times I really believe that the other reviewers are right -- this is a great resource on neural networks. However, just be sure you have the appropriate background to really get the most out of it.If you are looking for an introductory book on neural nets or are a little rusty on your statistics and math I would recommend looking elsewhere."
4,This book is a Rosetta stone into neural networks,"This text has an extensive development of Neural networksfrom a strong statistical basis. For anyone wanting aquick way to access the broad spectrum of literature coveringneural networks and find the seminal papers, thoughts, developmentsof the field, the literature references are worth the price.This is essentially a literature survey, and not a ""how-to""book. It is not excessively heavy on the mathematics butthe uses verbiage to enhance the math that is necessary forsuch a topic. It handles a number of significant but oftenoverlooked issues, such as the need for an ordering scheme of the partialderivatives in backpropagation. Most authors don't address the obscurebut important points that will make or break your work if youaren't aware of them. Ripley makes the reader cognizant ofwhere the minefields lie. This book is a Rosetta stone intoneural networks."
2,Didn't get anything out of it.,"After sitting down several times and attempting to learn something from Ripley's Pattern Recognition book I am frustrated each time. I wish Ripley could be a better author. From his writings you can see he knows a lot about Neural Networks, but cannot relate it to the reader. The text is VERY heavy in mathematical formulas (about 1/3 page of pure math per page). Another third of the book are references to other papers (There are 35 pages of references. Ripley cites about 1000 different papers.). That doesn't leave a lot left over for the reader. I suggest this book only for those already familiar enough with Neural Nets to have their papers cited by Ripley.One thing did surprise me. There is one page with color! Describing clustering (I think). I almost died laughing. Showed it to other stat friends familiar with Ripley and we chuckled."
2,Disappointing,"These are the types of Pashmina you can buy from the street vendors of New York for $5. They are exactly the same, even down to the slip cover packaging. The quality is acceptable, some frayed edges and very thin, but a nice stocking filler. Certainly not worth the price listed here."
4,A very shot (but dense) introduction,"Lim's ""short"" introduction packs more information into 134 pages than most do in 300+. This is a terrific resource for those who want a strong, basic grasp of Scroll scholarship and archeology. My only complaint is that Lim's bias shows through in his excitement regarding several Scroll controversies.Anyone interested in the Scrolls will find this a helpful resource."
4,Healing,An enlightening performance. Every listening takes me out of my mind. Spacemen have redefined minimalism and provided a rich and flavorfull sonic experience by acknowledging the healing power of music without melody.
4,Minimalism to the Maximum,"Yes, this CD has 3 tracks. Yes, it is over an hour long. Yes, you should own this if you have any interest in Sp3. Recorded live at the end of Spacemen 3's long run in obscurity, Dreamweapon proves Sp3 knew what they were doing. The first track, An Evening of Contemporary Sitar Music, provides the listener a rush if they listen closely. Focusing on tightly knit, sparse chords with backgroud reverb, the high comes from the subtle changes in chord structure. Sonic and Jason are the focus on this live album, and perhaps thier creative spark was finally burned out: it seems that they try to out do eachother on each track. One fighting for recognition of reverb and the other proving his point with minimalist chord structure. This album proves Sp3 will be the next Velvet Undeground: never popular but never forgotten."
3,Though it was cool at first!,"I bought this stroller and thought it looked so cool and Euro looking and it folds like a dream, but it was not very safe or comfortable to my 7 mon. old daughter. It is a nice stroller for 1 year and up to about 5 years if you had to push a 5 year old. So I returned it and got the savvy soho and love it! not as cool looking but better for my daughters comfort and safety. If you like the volo which does have it's purpose save your money and buy a kolkraft umbrella $20.00 much better then a $100.00 for the same thing!! P.S mom's who care RocK!"
1,"Save your money, buy the original.","This is just a rehash of J.M. Hurst's excellent work, ""The Profit Magic of Stock Transaction Timing"". I fount the original easier to understand and liked Hurst's plain-talking style better. If Millard added anything original, I did not find it."
1,Not Bluetooth discoverable,I was going to give this mouse as a gift. Luckily I tested it out first and to my surprise it did not work! I am running a system that meets all of the minimum system requirements. I am running a Mac with Lion. 10.7.3. This mouse was not even discoverable by the system. The system requirements state that it will work for later operating systems. This is not the case. I made sure to power the mouse properly as well and followed all the directions. I do not recommend this product.
1,Terrible Performance and No Customer Support,"Bought 2 bluetooth mice for old laptop and new one. Installed both and they seemed worked fine. Then they began to just cease working randomly. Also stopped working whenever computer went to sleep. Only way to get them working was to uninstall and reinstall, which happened multiple times per day. Called customer support and got a recording asking for my phone number to call me back. NO CALL BACK. Tried again with same results. Will have to return. Major waste of time and very frustrating. LastIOMagic product I ever buy...and I'll rethink buying on Amazon as opposed to retail store."
1,Waste of Money,"Couldn't get this paired with my mac OSx 10.8.... What a waste of moneyInstructions or scant, and there was no help on their web siteInstructions promise live chat, but there is no link on the web site"
1,Unstable as my ex-wife.,"Pleasant most of the time but occasionally looses paring for no reason accounting for much frustration. I have a ritual of shaking it, bumping it, pressing the reset button, and turning it off and back on again. The ritual is required whenever the screen saver goes back to login and makes the mouse turn itself off. Aggggggghh!"
1,Bad Sound Quality and Terrible Track Selection,"Well the headline says it all. Another Luther ""greatest"" where the tracks were taken off a vinyl copy of the original record. You can still hear the pops on this disc. What's the problem - the original tapes exist - Ace used them. Why do companies like Malco think they can get away with this?"
1,Not what I wanted,"This is not the CD you may think it is. Maybe I should have figured out what the ""All star jam"" meant, but this is not worth buying. I purchased it because the only song I really wanted was ""Your Woman"", and I come to find out it's all covers. Not too bad for covers, but why not buy the real thing? I just wasted my money!"
3,fun,"You could never mistake this album for a classic, but I think it is a must-have for its inoffensive charms. In this day of garbage-can kitsch, Papas Fritas takes a more literal approach, recreating to a tee the bubble-gum sheen of the 70s. I swear I hear the Partridge Family in there somewhere! Interestingly, the standout hit ""Hey Hey, You Say""sounds quite original to my ears, with its minimalist arrangement and spooky musicbox backdrop. While the album may eventually prove to be disposable, that single should always be close at hand. Incidentally, if you ever get the chance to see them, they are a great act. Luckily, they're in my back yard."
1,Not for me,"Maybe it is just me, but this CD does not do anything for me. I've tried it on a few CD players and the ""music"" is not at all soothing, or sleep inducive. It sounds to me to be unclear at times or not something that would lead to a peaceful sleep. But as I said, it could just be me. But I did expect more. Don't think I will play/use it again."
2,"Bizarre. Reminds Me of ""2001: A Space Odyssey""","I've listened to this CD for about a week. All it has done for me is conjure the Black Slab from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" AND the psychedelic sequence (i.e., vivid colors flashing w/dense, deep musical sounds) as the astronaut (Keir Dullea) was about to find his way into The Room.That anyone has fallen asleep listening to this is nothing short of miraculous.If it works for you, then fine. I've had better luck listening to Hindu and/or Gregorian chants.Hoping to find that some day, some where, I have delta waves..."
3,Wasn't quite what I expected.,"I wasn't satisfied with this CD. It was nice, but didn't get me to sleep any better."
5,Sleeping Soundly for a change!,I purchased this CD a few weeks ago and it works like a charm. I've never heard it to the end yet. Sometimes will wake up in the same position with the headphones on having slept all the way through the night. I'm so glad I tried this!
5,This Really Works,"We bought this CD, and the first night we tried it, we noticed improvement in the length and quality of our sleep. We're not sure if the CD really works, or if it's the ""power of suggestion"", but we'll take it. It's now an ever-present element in our nightly sleep routine."
2,Delta sleep system 2.0,"It's not nearly as good as I thought it would be. I got a demo cd from centerpointe about holosync, and just the demo was mind-altering and relaxing. I should have spent my money with them instead. Sorry for the bad review, but I was really disappointed, especially from all the hype about this product."
4,A different kind of swing,"I received this from my sister after being introduced to Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Cherry Poppin' Daddies...it's a different kind of swing. Smoother, more relaxed, and calmer. Don't get me wrong...I'm about to get rid of CPD, still love BBVD. Naughty Ones are right up there on my list of favorites now. They are closer to Lavay Smith...a different kind of swing...mellow. I recommend it if you like trational. I recommend it if you like the neo-swing. I recommend it if you like western-swing."
5,Who doesn't love those Little People!,"Fisher Price has done it again! When reading Eddies Shopping Surprise your toddler will scream and laugh in anticipation of what is under the next ""flap"". Each flap is well made and stands up well to the hands of your favorite ""little people"". This adorable story is a terrific springboard to any shopping trip you may take your little one on."
3,"Drowning in ""Waterfall""","A detailed and well-supported essay on the the ""waterfall"" method of software development. The author defines a wicked problem and then explains the various leaks in the waterfall method for most software projects. Documented variations are then explained in detail and how they attempt to plug the leaks. Most of these include either spiral, prototyping, iterative, or incremental techniques to enhance one or several of the ""classical"" steps in the waterfall approach.Finally several other methods of software development are discussed such as: ""video / hollywood"", ""clean room"", ""scrum"", and ""sashimi"". Overall the writing style was fluid and very easy to read however the content is somewhat dated when compared to the newer texts on agile methodologies. If you are committed to using the waterfall method or a variant then this book provides sound advice and good references."
2,Antiqued,"I think this book has a point that another book doesn't have. But, simply put, I feel difficult to understand the point.Unfortunately, this book is too old. The examples that the authors show seems rather unfamiliar for me. I don't know about COBOL or Fortran. As well, I don't know theories or situations at that time when the book was published. Hence, I don't understand those and those problems."
2,2nd one to leak! Wonderfully comfortable til they leak.,Nothing against the seller but this is the second one of this model of pillow that started leaking after just a few weeks of use. I've bought two because it is by far the most comfortable bath pillow that we have used but they don't last. The weak link is where the suction cups attach to the inflatable inner pillow. The product would be much better WITHOUT any suction cups.My wife and I now use zip lock freezer bags wrapped in a hand towel for bath pillows - they are cheap and hold air about as long as the above mentioned pillow before leaking. Happy Jucuzzi's everyone.
4,supersuckers with mudhoney's mark arm and others,"this album has a very similar feel to ""must've been high."" just a good time caught on vinyl, the covers of drug store and breakin' the law are best for dancing with yer daughters. another perfect release from sympathy."
4,If The Stones were from Arkansas...,"if The Rolling Stones were from Arkansas, they'd be The Junkyard Dogs. Not the band from Canada but a few ""Born Losers"" from the Supersuckers. Truly one of the greatest ""party albiumz"" of all tyme. High point : the moment when the galz chorus starts to sing in ""Lightning Bar Blues"". Pure Honky-Tonk Majick! AND there's a hidden track! This disc is especially fun for reformed alkies 'n' druggies. Get's you there without the hangover!Get it. Got it?"
4,"Hers to hold, should be yours to own.... another good film..","This is a film, loosely the 3rd one in the 3 smart girls series. You getto see your favorite characters that you loved and also provided witha good movie. Set during the war, we have a chance to see our men and womenworking at a B17 assembly plant. Should give the viewers a chance to see thesegreat scenes and get to feel what they had to go through in the 40's.Deanna is all grown up, sisters are gone but she is still unmarried. Goodlittle script, great signing....what else do you want.Note: These movies are not just for Grandma and Grampa,,,they are unique, theyshow off some great signing by our past artists...and you never get tosee movies like this anymore....does our youth have the patience formovies without special effects....Loved it at 13 years old.....still loving it now at 52 years old."
4,Another Sweet Durbin Film,"Deanna Durbin stars a Penny Craig, a role she has played twice before. She's a society girl and very beautiful. She visits a hospital for a checkup where Bill Morley (Joseph Cotten) spots her and impersonates a doctor to meet her. When she learns the ruse, she gets annoyed and tries to avoid him, but he won't give up. Finally, he wins her over and she falls desperately in love with him, but the possibility that he might have to go to war looms over their heads.Durbin is stunning in this film, and her trademark mischieviousness is present even in spite of growing up. She sings several songs including ""Say a Pray'r for the Boys Over There."" Cotten is adequate as her romantic interest, although his character isn't entirely swoon-worthy.For fans of Three Smart Girls and Three Smart Girls Grow Up, there are many references to Penny's past. There is even a bit where Penny and her parents relive moments through home movies; in reality they are clips from past films."
3,"Good story, not the best writer","The story-telling in this book is great, but the grammar is not. For example, the first sentence in the book is an incomplete sentence. The book is filled with other grammatical errors and poorly constructed sentences. It's a good book, but it could have been great with better grammar, sentence structure and overall writing."
4,The Real Badfinger Live Album,"Badfinger did 3 live permances for The BBC, this CD contains the first two, the third unfortunately seems to have disappeared (erased?). The first 7 tracks are from a 1972 concert at Paris Theatre, London; the next 7 are from a 1973 performance also at The Paris Theatre and the last Come and Get It is from Top of The Pops 1970. The sound quality is good and the performances are mostly very good; a few wrong chords can be noticed some of last tracks. It's interesting to hear their versions of two Dave Mason songs. Both tracks feature long guitarsolos and are good examples of the difference between their records and their liveact. This album should be a positive surprise to those who thought Badfinger was only a pop-act. The band really rocks here!"
5,Finally... a jammin' jazz act with real syle,"This group has everything... searing instrumentals, fantastic improvisational style, and a harmonious balance that'll have jazz fans of all ages tapping their toes and humming the tunes. You'll be playing this CD over and over again."
4,"Fun, but misleading","After looking at the cover, I expected a bunch of young co-eds with glazed faces. I'm a HUGE fan of Taylor St. Claire, so I was particularly looking forward to seeing her with a glazed face. Wrong, and wrong. 1st of all, not college girls on Spring Break. 2nd, Taylor was only in a single girl-girl seen. But... this DVD was full of pleasant surprises. Lots of girls(well, women). Lots of scenes. Lots of glazing."
4,Great add to your wardrobe,"This boot looks great and fits very comfortably. Runs a little small so i would suggest a 1/2 size bigger. Leather is soft, heals aren't too high. Great with jeans or skirts. Definitely a good buy. :)"
1,Don't trust the answers!,"I have really studied the civil war and was using this book as a last minute test prep. I have already found two answers wrong in this test prep and I am only 1/4 of the way thru it! I emailed the editor. The answer keys was wrong and would have mislead me if I had not already knew the material!!! I bought 4 other Dantes exam prep books and I am sending them all back, I am afraid to study questions with possibly the wrong answers"
3,great but diluted,"I have been buying this product for years and this shampoo used to be the very best. It was concentrated and I only needed a little. Now, I need 3 times as much to get a nice lather so I run out much faster. I will only by this shampoo when it is a good deal. It is still my favorite shampoo and my hair still has great results but I am very dissapointed that the company thinned out this product!I love the hydrating C-contditioner in the dark orange bottle that has not been thinned out and I hope they never do!My hair type is wavy/curly dryish and this product helps prevent frizzies. My hair stylist thinks my hair is in great shape."
4,"It's pretty nice, especially if you don't use conditioner","My hair is oilier nowadays so this is perfect since I don't (really more can't) use conditioner any more. When I was using conditioner I found it not ""stripping"" enough. It smells nice too. And I guess being organic and having no sulfate are of course pluses."
1,Big disappointment,"Today was the first time I used this shampoo and was not happy with it. Although this shampoo smells great in the bottle and had nice lather, it was hard to wash off and left my hair feeling heavy and waxy when it finally dried. The great scent didn't last though. I also found that i lost twice as much hair as I normally lose but I don't know if that can be attributed to this specific shampoo. I can't believe I paid $15 for such a horrible product."
4,casio replaces timex,"I have been using a Timex digital for over 30 years. It has the exact functions as this Casio but it does have a light. It has a gold band and can be worn at a dressier function. Unfortunately, Timex does not appear to be making their watch any longer-at least I cannot find it. I am very happy with this watch but I do wish it had a light. I guess I can carry around a small flashlight when I need to see it in the dark like at the movies. This is a very nice watch and nicely priced. Thanks Casio."
2,relogio,"No gostei deste relógio, porque no correspondeu às minhas espetativas. No só pelo tamanho como também pelo design. Espero que levem isso em considerao."
3,finally a feminine watch with timer,"I have been looking for a feminine looking watch with a minimum of 3 alarms, to take medicine on time. I thought I had found one, but it only has 1 alarm and no light. I will keep on looking. I use the TImex triathlon watch witch works fine but looks funny with a dress."
5,Great watch!,It is impossible to find a decent looking digital watch for women these days and this one is about the only one out there. It's easy to set and use and I'm very happy with it.
4,Dressy Digital....just what I was looking for!,I had been looking for a dressy digital. I wish this watch had a backlight. I'd also like to see the date without pushing a button. But this watch looks nice and functions well.
3,Watch Collector,"I like the watch, but it doesn't seem to have a light to help you see it in the dark. Other than that it's a nice looking watch."
2,Not a fan,"It was much smaller than i expected, and the band length is wayyyy to big for my wrists, and i could not get the band clasp to open. It feels very cheap and its kind of difficult to figure out how to program unless you thoroughly read the manual.It would be great if it was much bigger and the band could be better adjusted."
2,Nice to look at but too small for practical use,"The watch is pretty. However, the alarm is inaudible. The date and day are so small that they are not readily readable.I really would like to return the watch. It was a Christmas present and so the normal return time had passed before my wife opened her present and got a chance to use it. She is recovering from back surgery and wasn't able to even open presents until after Jan 2."
5,Dressier functional watch,"I have worn the stainless steel watch for years and was so happy to see a gold tone which is dressier than the other. I love the functions of this watch and particularly use the timer for so many things including bar-b-queing, cooking, reminder to take clothes out of the dryer, etc.."
5,Exelente Libro. Tiene muchicima información.,Este libro te llecara a otro nivel. Gracias al vendedor que lo recomiendo con mis ojos cerrados. El libro esta en exelentes condiciones!!!!
2,The house is nice but...,"The house itself is nice...but it is a tad overpriced. The description is vague to say the least. I believed the house was constructed of wood for nearly two hundred dollars. It has wood molding, the doors are wooden. The house itself is a particle board type material. The house arrived damaged but, was fixable- the shipping cost is ridiculous! All in all although a nice product the price is inflated. I would not have purchased had I seen this in person. Then thats just my opinion others may vary!"
2,Remake of good songs,"Alot of the titles on this cd are good songs. Too bad they arent done by the original artists. They are all remakes of the songs. now some of them sound better than the original versions. ""Return of the mack"" sounds better to me than the original version by mark morrison IMHO. You get what you pay for, if you like what you hear in the samples, go for it. Just be prepared for an annoying version of How Bizzare and Men in Black."
3,an all Auzi Picture,saw this movie in PP New Guinea while diving at a resort. Its so typically Australian humor that I loved it and have shown it to friends in the states
3,Not what we expected,I had seen a review of this movie in a local paper some time ago and it was described as absolutely hilarious. There was no rating for it. We did find it humorous but not hilarious. there was offensive language that we didn't appreciate. Will be more careful of ordering unrated movies in the future.
4,A good resource for the cause behind spiritual evils,"I enjoyed reading this book and found it provided some great insights into the origins of evil on this planet, and how evil has been injected into our society through things like drugs, music, etc. The only reason I am cautious to give it 5 stars is because it is a compiled and edited version of the Messengers' original words, so it may not be a pure representation of their teachings. Overall, worth reading, but with discernment."
5,great for travel or at home,"I ordered these before I went on a long trip, and was so glad I did. They worked out great (no pun intended). These would even be good to use at home all the time, no need to worry about them dropping and breaking the floor."
5,Heat Stroke is Hot!,This was such a great book! I am into the whole Weather Warden series. You will enjoy it!
1,Couldn't keep it in my hands,"Well, after giving Ms. Caine a second chance I was disappointed again. She couldn't make it past the first chapter without having an otherwise brilliant story distroyed with sex. I am truly sorry Ms. Caine, your life is so sad that you have to fantasize about sex constantly and feel you need to share it with your readers. I'd write this directly to you except your website does not have a comment sextion.Too bad, I do really like magic, fantasy, and superhuman things and the Weather Warden fits in perfectly with the one exception. I am glad I borrowed the series from the library."
2,"A bit flat, one dimensional","I had a hard time getting excited about this book because the first one didn't impress me too much. The entire plot is about a rift opening in the sky that Lewis wants closed, Joanne attempts to close it and notices blue sparkly objects. Blue sparkly objects are bad. That's pretty much it, throw in a love story with David and a few other characters: Patrick, ifrit Sara, djinns Jonathan and Rahel, and that sums it up. Nothing momentous in my opinion. The author tries to add some action and intensity, but I wasn't feeling it at all. I didn't get a sense of imminent danger from blue things, and I'm not all that interested in the intricacies of fixing storms and natural disasters, so this series might not be for me. Also, Joanne's character bothers me a bit. She's tough, has too much attitude, talks about how sexy each man she comes across is, yet is strangely helpless at times. Decent book, I skipped a bit of it, so about 2.5 starts."
3,Heat!,"This is another series that my daughter has talked about a lot so we ordered the set of books from Amazon. Could not find all of them in local book store, they could order them but it was much easier to order them myself. I will read them soon."
4,Good so far...,"I immediately bought the next four books after reading ""Ill Wind"". It's a good continuation. The only thing that I wish that the author would do better at is actually breaking her books into smaller chapters so you have a good resting point between readings! (""Heat Stroke"" is only 2 chapters!) Otherwise, good series, can't wait to finish up ""Heat Stroke"" and start reading the others!"
4,"Improvement over the first, but cliffhanger ending...","Ex-Weather Warden Joanna Baldwin has died and returned as a djinn. But being djinn is not a 'get out of dead free' card as she quickly finds out. David, the free-djinn who used his magic to rescue her, is sharing his power to keep them both alive. Joanne's got to learn--and learn quickly--how to live on her own, else both she and David may well die and for good. Book's decent enough to keep reading, but the first part of it wades through a lot of 'relationship material' between her and David that I could do without. The point off is for that and the cliffhanger ending."
5,Really deserves 4.75,"I really enjoyed this book. I find this series to be very original. I am a bit disappointed that Jo didn't remain how she was (not to give too much away) but it was still good and held my attention nonetheless. David and Jo have got to be one of the most tortured couples I've ever read about. I also hated what happened to Lewis and Jonathan by the end. I'm looking forward to seeing what horrible destruction Kevin will cause.other books I enjoy: Kim Harrison- Rachel Morgan series, Jenna Black-Morgan Kingsley series, Larissa Ione- Demonica series, Ilona Andrews- Kate Daniels series, Richelle Mead- Georgina Kinkaid series and Dark Swan Series, Audra and Stella Price- Eververse series, Yasmine Galenorn- Sisters of the Moon series, Vicki Pettersson- Zodiac series; Jackie Keller- Hell on Earth series, T.A. Pratt- Marla Mason series; Mark Henry- Happy Hour of the Damned"
4,I Wish They Would Let Us Rate 1/2 Stars,"Poor Rachel Caine keeps getting compared to other authors, which is a shame because I think she stands on her own along with other fantasists who can create strong female action characters. She also lets Joanne have fun in a very earthy way AND she does this in the first person.This one wasn't as focused as the first book but it did have a great deal more background to assimilate and I, for one, thought it champion!"
4,"Good read, more mature than the first","I bought this book as soon as it came out, after eagerly waiting for its release. I was a little disappointed when I didn't get drawn in right away, but I chalked it up to being too busy to focus and tried it again about a month later. I'm glad I did.The author definitely stepped up and did some work on the characters here. I enjoyed the background to the characters and the issues boiling up around them. I did find the story slowed down in spots, as it did the first book.I already have the 3rd book in the series cued up in my 'to read' pile."
2,Would be better online,"This book would be better implemented in WIKI form online. As a sourcebook on where to find various cultivars, it quickly becomes dated. Also a WIKI would allow addition of much more information on how to use, photos, etc. Info on each plant is light in this book form."
1,Very Disappointed,Waited a long time for this book to arrive and when it came I was stunned to find that there was not ONE diagram or picture in this book and the book is huge. The book review never mentions pictures so I guess this is my fault. If you like books with just lists this is the book for you. Very diappointed. I wanted to use the book to identify greens. This book shows alot of research but it is worthless to me.
1,book binding is faulty,"We had been considering buying this for a long time and when we finally did, it was time to be using it. We had been familiar already with the material it contains. As a source book for seeds and plants it is known to be excellent information ...a valuable reference book.SO, we were VERY disappointed when we opened to book and noticed a faulty binding, with very little use, pages were beginning to come loose."
2,a disappointment,"I read about two-thirds of this book. I was expecting more based on the author's reputation. I didn't come away with much that was memorable, other than don't drop a hand granade on your PC. There's not much technical meat here. I think that this book is for non-technical types."
2,"Okay, but a bit over the top","It's a good book with a strong point, but the message grows tiresome. Practically everything is a potential security weakness to this guy. If you lock the doors, he warns about the windows. If you encase your house in concrete, I'm sure he could find some concrete eating bacterium from the jungle. It grows a bit tiresome.I'm a bit surprised that he's actually in the security business. How can he hold such views and actually make recommendations to clients? Does he say, ""Gosh this solution is terribly dangerous, but it's not as dangerous as the other solutions?""Plus, he's obviously a bit out of touch. He says that steganography can't work because no one ever sends him a picture. Heck, I get pictures from my family members all of the time. What's wrong with him?It's not a bad book, but it's a bit too much."
2,Overrated book,"I sympathise with the opinions of many of the more critical reviewers. The book is for non-technical people. It does introduce a number of areas of importance to security professionals, but far too superficially. The depth of coverage is admittedly deeper than a newspaper or newsmagazine piece on the subject, but it's not much deeper. The style is a bit too sensational. The organisation of the book could do with an overhaul - the author tends to drift off into examples of dubious relevance. The book in general could do with a tighter and more stream-lined organisation.The book isn't devoid of merit and people wishing to learn about the area could do worse than start here. For myself, I'm waiting for Ross Anderson's new book titled, ""Security Engineering""."
5,"Great book, really like it","I highly recommend this book, for everyone interested in comp security. This is book is very comprehensive, and covers every possible aspect. Even so it was published in 2000, I didn't feel it's dated, since the problems are the same."
5,"It's not a product, it's a process!","Bruce Schneier offers an excellent 'big picture' overview of the computer security field. From types of attacks, to algorithm security to security in the context of your data center, you get a full overview of the current practices and consequences arising from them. The author argues for security as a process, not a product; security is not something you can add to your product after the fact. Starting from the product specification, down to your last outsourced programmer, security has to permeate your organization for it to work. Building 'attack trees', relying on peer review and enforcing liability are all suggestions advanced by Bruce Schneier.Secrets and Lies is a well organized book with plenty of real world examples, problems and solutions. Buy a copy for yourself, and many more for everybody else you know, we will all benefit in the end."
5,Extraordinary book if you want to understand,"""Secrets and Lies"" by Bruce Schneier taught me that computer security is much more than building better firewalls and managing them well. Schneier knows most hacks come through social engineering, unguarded other entrances, email delivered trojans, and other techniques that bypass the firewall entirely.He also knows that security will never be perfect, and talks frankly about how to minimize the risks you can't eliminate.That's the real world, and he treats it with deep understanding. Most computer books are ""just the faqs"" dumps of the subject, with a little organization. Schneier instaed is thoughtful and eloquent.He changed entirely how I thought about the subject. Dave Burstein"
4,Excellent Book,Excellent book. A must read for any IT professional. The first 1/3 of the book is a little slow to get going for those already familiar with security concept such as CIA.
5,A good introduction to digital security,"This book is not very technical but it is very interesting to read and is very good to convey the basic principles of security. This book will teach you why security is more important than ever with the advent of computers and internetworking. It will present you potential attackers, their motivations and their resources. It shows how to add security to a system by doing some analysis of how the system could be attacked. After reading this book, you will have a better understanding of what it means to make a digital system secure."
1,To whoom was it written?,"Some references said that this book a business issue, not a technical one. The second half of this statement is definitely correct. I'm an engineer teachig in a Community College and I looked for some book to brush up the interest of my students. Not a technical book. Unluckily enough I've selected this one, but I was disappointed very much.Words and words. So much text and hardly any fact. If any that's old enough being known publicly.I'm sure that even business people have not enough time to read through so much text for so little relevant information to mine out.So as for the first half of the statement cited, I doubt that businessman can gain anything of this book except the fear of using such a public facility as Internet is."
1,"This is no ""Applied Cryptography"".","Devoid of useful information. Most of the book is devoted to a pathetic angst-ridden grappling with the idea that there is no perfect security. Well, duh. Get over it Bruce. Tell us something we don't know. The only points of light are the antedotes and the idea that risk can be a business opportunity, by managing it well."
1,Disappointing,"This is a sales book! The book outlines many of the security problems today, but offers only one solution: to hire the author's company."
4,Great book,Overall the book was a great read. I wanted to get a high overview of computer security and the different aspects of it and this book delivered. It was not too technical at all and presented everything in lay men's terms. Great book for the not so technical wanting to get a good overview.Now my next book is Practical Cryptography!!!
4,A new Age in Information Security,"It is nice to see a new era of Information Security books. I am happy to see book like ""Secrets and Lies"" which shows security beyond the computer and other books like ""Inside the Security Mind"" that teach us there is more to security than just our Firewall. Good reads!!!"
5,Security is Ensured by Process not by a Tool,"This book a bit less technical, and has a nice qualitative/accessible feel to it. The book makes a point that good security requires vigilance and cooperation of authorities and users of secure systems. Schneier shows (accurately) how the best systems software for security through cryptography can be subverted by ""social engineering"" (human error induced by the intruder) or by misapplication of tools. Managers of companies with machines connected to the internet really ought to take a look at this to get a sense of both their level of risk exposure and what options might be available to them. I strongly recommend this book to both my students and colleagues."
2,A Really Disappointing Read,"I was expecting Schneier to have penned a more in-depth view of security in modern systems, but this book was a shallow imitation of a number of other security-related texts I have read. If you want a management-level overview then this book will be a useful read, but if you are looking for any depth or insight, look elsewhere. Other texts such as ""Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems"" give a better look at the field."
5,"Not only informative, but also imaginative!","This book taught me what kind of peepings were performed not only by hackers, but also by governments and companies in a network world. The author is looking at the bigger problems lurking in the reverse side of hacker incidents which covers TV, News and Magazines. We are tend to think hacker as a most dangerous one in the network world, but like everyday life, the most dangerous existence is rich and is organized groups. Who are they?And this book gave me some business inspiration. In the US, the collected individual information (database) is the property of collectors, not individuals. I'd better to collect database now. Few (no?) Internet-related regislation is available, so everything is OK. In the future, I can get money from that!? I have to follow the way DoubleClick does."
3,"Good pictures, bad hardware","This made in China camera takes really good pictures, but after 1 year of few use both the zoom button and right arrow key (macro) stopped working (and also the pictures' display did). The miss of a viewer is a pity, and it takes to much energy of batteries (it lasts less of 100 pictures, average use)."
4,Its great for the price,The camera itself is great for the price. The only thing I miss is the view finder. Tried to take pictures in Badlands Nat.Park The sun was in my face so the LCD screen was very hard to see. The pictures from the camera are great. Overall its a good deal.
4,"DANCE, DANCE, DANCE: THE DANCE OF LIFE!","What a wonderful book. As he did in The Autobiography of a Jukebox, Eady envelops us in a world we will all recognize and yet he makes us look at it with a new set of eyes. This book is devoted to exploring the dance of life, many times in the form of anaphora. This lends a musical grace to these poems. You find yourself returning to these poems again and again. The poems themselves take us from a piano concert to a sort of ode to a ballet dancer to a couple planning their new house and beyond. A transcendent book of poetry. In The Woman Who Dances With God, he writes ""Let's assume that when we die/Our souls go to heaven/That places a high premium/On asthetic values."" Let's hope Eady's poems meet us a heaven's gate!"
2,I don't think it's paid for itself...,"...but that could be because I don't know too much about cars. I suppose you could get more out of it if you're a pro...In most cases, there are better directions (including diagrams, exploded views of parts, etc.) on lots of different online sites. The 96-00 Civic is one of the most modified cars around today, and there are a thousand sites with the info you need. This manual wasn't even helpful with wiring the optional cigarette lighter/ashtray console. It's okay to have it along with the real instructions, but don't try to use it as a replacement. If you're thinking of buying this because you want to tinker with your car a little bit... don't.."
2,honda repair book,this book isn't the best manual. Doesn't go into detail and changing parts. The picture in the manual are not that good. It just gives basic info not much more.
4,"MERENGUE, MERENGUE...Y MAS MERENGUE!","Si te gusta el merengue tienes que tener este CD. Aqui hay merengue romantico y merengue bomba, en fin 100% Merengue. Las mejores canciones son: ""Mas"" de Jessica, ""Lo Dudo"" de Grupo Karis, ""Atada"" de Gisselle, ""Vuelve Mi Amor"" de Michael Gabriel, y ""Quiero Ser"" de Raza Latina."
3,7 Healing Chakras,"I cannot evaluate the book, as I have not read it. I can't remember the seller, but the book was yellowed and in poor condition, which desuased me from reading it. The author's experience is valid. She is an educated woman who is an MD, and also deals with energies. It wasn't the book, but the condition of my book, that I did not like."
5,Leanring about the Chakras,Very intersting book. I am just beginning to learn about the chakras and getting them open to positive energy. This is a good book for that and also a teaching/working book. It is not a book to read through and put down. I am going slowly and doing all of the written work suggested and meditations. Sometimes going over more than once to get very familiar with before moving on in the book. Has become a part of my daily ritual.
5,Best chakra book I've read,"This is by far the best chakra book I have read. She not only goes into detail about how each chakra effects you physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually, but it's filled with exercises. Being an intuitive empath, my favorite exercises are tuning down your chakra exercises to keep negative influences from affecting you. I do that every morning after doing Doreen Virtue's chakra clearing exercise and I feel fantastic all day, but if not, I feel lousy."
3,Different .. in writting style and not at the Top of my list,"This is one of the first books I purchased that was strictly on Chakras. Her views and style of writting was OK at the time but since then I have found other Authors that are alot better. I read this book in less then 1 week so it an easy read and doesn't delve very deep. She also devotes a Chapter to each Chakra, and gives a fair overview, correspondences, the rest of it is exercises like meditations and jounaling questions. If you purchase this book you must get the companion book the workbook- the workbook is great, it doesn't really add anythng new, but it better explains the meditations and you can use it for your jounal. I would give the Workbook a higher rating the the actual book! Also most of the information find in this book can be found on the information/correspondences page of the workbook just in less detail. She definetly has her view of Chakras, and through study I just don't mesh well with her views."
3,Definitly NOT Better,"I've been using NOW Stevia for many many years. I've always used the Stevia in Glycerin. I recently purchased the 'Better' Stevia in the alcohol base. For my taste it is not better, and in fact I am quite disappointed. I wish I could return it. The alcohol base makes it difficult to pour by droplets, and many droplets get wasted and run down the side with each use.Add to that I do not like the flavor of this new product."
5,good stuff stevia,"regular user of stevia in everything especially my coffee and tea, fast receipt of product, would buy from again, prompt,easy, well packed"
1,Not what it says!,"If you read the description listed in Amazon, it states that this product is ""Pure, Concentrated Extract of Stevia"". It is not. It's a chemical derivitive and contains simple sugar extracts to make it more palatable. If you're buying this because you want to avoid sugar and chemistry, RUN FROM THIS PRODUCT!! The advertising is false and misleading."
3,"A well-written book about ""being"".","This is the story of a man who, by Fortune or Fate, became an aviator during WWII. This book is more about his transformation from boy to man than it is about the history of aviation in World War Two. Still, its an insightful piece and the imagery is fantastic. I can still see Mr. Hynes sitting in his tent during a typhoon, and the sunlight glinting off of the Mustang's wings just before it collided and fell into the ocean. If you're interested in ""feeling"", then this book is a ""5"". If you're more interested in the adventure and drama, then this book is a ""2"". My rating is the average of the two, as I bought it for the adventure and ended up with the feeling."
5,Flights of Passage soars....,"Mr. Hynes work originally attracted me because, as an aviation historian, I enjoy first person accounts. My interest was drawn to the book when he mentioned that some of his training was in Florida--my state of birth. Having noticed the town Deland in his account I acquired the volume for a check of conditions in the state during the was (having 2 uncles who were naval aviators). It was an interesting picture of the US in another era--a Florida I used to know. I was by the Deland airport (it is noted as ""Deland Naval Air Station--1942-46) (We fought the war, finished it and shut down the war machine.) In fact the majority of now-civilian airports were built during WWII. This was a bittersweet tale of men who were part of a much larger effort; but didn't regard their contribution as telling.The last chapter has the memorable line ""You can go back in space, but not back in time. Lucius B. Gravely, IV"
3,Pilot?,"The people who gush over this book have probably not ever been involved in military aviation. Not only does Hynes openly refer to enlisted men (the backbone of the Corps) with a typical 2nd Lieutenant's disdain, he openly puts them in danger on numerous occasions with only his own ego at stake. He never really demonstrates professionalism in his flying, either in the act or his attitude. He seems more fixated on drinking than on developing his questionable flying skills. But, afterall, he was only a 20 year old, and a rather immature one at that as witness his nonchalance about getting married, and rare mention of his wife or what she must have gone through over his antics. As myself a veteran of 10 years of Marine Aviation, I can relate to a lot of it. When Hynes describes the quarters at Memphis, I've live in them myself. My attitude, however, turned from amusement to disgust as I progressed through the book."
2,GIFTED WRITER; POOR AVIATOR?,"This is a very well written book by an obviously gifted writer who seems to describe him self as a careless and irresponsible Naval Aviator. He writes of his little concern for his own crew members. He goes on ad nauseam regarding his fascination with raunchy limericks. He describes his poor flying judgement and careless unprofessional approach to flying safety which results several times in danger to others, unnecessary damage to aircraft and wasteful costs to taxpayers. He talks of his inattention to duty on anti-submarine patrol which would endanger those in the fleet he should have been protecting. The author deserves very high marks as an honest and talented writer but it seems a shame to represent Naval Aviators in such a poor light. My experience as a Naval Aviator leads me to believe the authors actions and attitudes were not typical."
3,Nat King Cole and Johnny Mathis Karaoke Disc,This comes with no lyric song sheet. If you don't know the words to each of the songs you can only learn by using your karaoke set up.
2,Not Quite,"Before I give this review, I just want to say, I love the Shojo manga, I love the stories, the conflicts and of course the love stories. Some how though, Kare Kano did not impress me.I had just finished Hot Gimmick and decided to pick this up because the synopsis had potential, So I sat in the book store and read volume 1. By the time I was finished with the book, I couldn't figure out WHY I would want to read an entire series based on the most annoying character I have ever encountered.Maybe it's because I can't relate to Yukino Miyazawa, Maybe it's because the art could use some work. Or maybe it's because this is a book for shallow people with nothing better to do than read a manga about a narcissist"
3,A Good Manga Gone Bad,"I never actually owned Kare Kano-My stepsister bought up to volume seven. At first I read volume one and developed a fondness for the quirky yet loveable Yukino and Sochiro. Yukino's home activities and Sochiro's quiet obliviosnous (?) were funny and sweet. Yet as my stepsister and I read on, each book seemed slightly less engaging. At about volume five both of us stopped liking it at all. By volume seven, we were getting really annoyed with this plotless mush. Book eight and nine were returned before they were read. I continued reading my own much-loved mangas of Rurouni Kenshin and Pita-ten, and my stepsister found a new manga called Ramna 1/2 that she liked much better. I would not reccomend this series to anyone, unless you're willing to buy books one through five and then give it up."
2,Not very good.....,"This manga sucked. the art wasn't really very good, and not deatailed. The story was very boring and hard to follow. I'm just glad I borrowed this from a friend so I didn't have to waste my money on it. After reading this review, please type in Yu yu hakusho in the search engine.That manga is way better than this piece of crap."
2,"Sorry, didn't like it.","Many people talked so much about this book. All good. I don't mean that it wasn't, but it didn't live up to all the hype. The artwork was wonderful, no doubt. You have to have something to draw you in beside artwork, and Kare Kano didn't do it for me. It wasn't was wonderful as everyone says. Kare Kano isn't one of my favorites.The story was not very appealing. The characters left no lasting impression on me. They were bland. Nothing note worthy. They are suppose to be perfect and than we are suppose to be so surpise when they aren't. I wasn't connected or enaged in the story. Last chapter and story was the only one that intrigued me.I haven't seen the anime and don't plan to after reading the manga."
1,I don't know how people can like it......,"I started the first book a few months ago i thought it was okay(if your arround 12 beleive me you won't like it,i don't mean to dissapoint anyone but take my advice.)I started to get into it more the mane characters are like 15 but they act older than they are.Arima and Miyaza are a cute couple at first but then i just got bored of seeing mostly them(Arima & Miyaza are the mane characters not sure if i spelt the girls name correct)I think that house wifes would like this lame story."
2,Ho Hum...,"I'm a big Shoujo fan, and, well...This just didn't cut it for me.1. The artwork is a bit lacking.2. The characters are not very interesting in fact they are a bit annoying. Everything about the lead characters and what they do is repetitive and...*Yawn*3. The story is all over the place. You really don't get a grasp of the direction the story is heading.I just didn't care much for it...It didn't capture me.There is much better Manga out there."
2,Meh,I received this item really fast but I was not expecting the massive size of this. It is almost a foot long with the top on. No way this would fit in any pocket. I also went to unscrew the flask topper and the whole flask came out. It will need some cleaning up and regluing before I can gift it. But I don't know If I even want to gift it as it is WAY too big.
2,Watch out for Hardware Version!,"Actually, the hardware is fine. I'm disappointed in Amazon.com. . .I bought the WET54G Wireless Bridge from Amazon.com to use with a WRTG54G Router in a small business network I support. I picked the WET54G after reviewing it on the Linksys site and noting that I could enable WPA security since both devices support WPA and WEP.UNFORTUNATELY, the WET54G I received from Amazon.com was NOT the hardware version 2 device but, instead, version 1.1 which shipped with firmware 2.05 (upgradeable to 2.06). . . BUT I need to have a vers 2.0 hardware with firmware 2.08 or higher in order to have WPA security capability!Watch out. Make sure that the product you buy is the current version!"
1,Simply doesn't work,"This device simply doesn't work properly. I purchased one, dealt with Cisco support, updated the firmware, etc., but still wound up returning it three days later.I bought it to interoperate with my Linksys WRT54G. I used the 11 mb WET11G for years and it was great. But the WET54G would run great for a few hours, and then it would slowly deteriorate. If I left it on overnight -- which I always do -- by the morning it would be barely working. A reboot would fix it, but then it would start the process again. I would literally need to boot it two or three times a day.A complete waste of time and shipping expense."
2,Old version doesn't support WPA,"Contrary to the information in the user's guide, the v1.1 bridge that Amazon sold me does not support WPA. This makes it useless in a modern wireless network. As there's no way to specify the version that Amazon ships (versions 1 through 3 exist), I'll be buying the bridge somewhere else.Overall, a significant disappointment as I needed the bridge working today."
2,Amazon-stocked item may not support WPA,"The item Amazon shipped to me was version 1.1--this version does NOT support WPA (and can't be upgraded to support WPA with a simple firmware upgrade, either). The current version is version 3."
3,WET54G v3,I purchased 3 WET54G's. The first one I tried did not work. I spent hours with LinkSys and no luck. I returned it to Amazon. To my surprise Amazon replaced it with no hassel at all. The original was a Version1. It did not work at all. The replacement was a version 3. It worked with no problem. It has been working now 24hrs/day for several weeks with no problem.The problem is there is no way to specify the version # when you order. It is not even specified on the box. You have to look on the label on the device itself.
3,Consider the WET54GS5 instead,"For just a little more money, the WET54GS5 adds a 5-port switch. Installation could not have been easier, and the unit seems well-made."
1,I thought it was just me...,"but from the other reviews, I realize it's the WET54G. I'm having all the same problems as the other reviewers. Very poor signal strength unless it's in the same room as the access point... and now I've got the blinking power light. Linksys also declined a valid rebate. I'm getting another bridge and never buying another linksys product."
3,WEP encryption fix,This product works great except for one huge flaw. The passkey translation to the hex string does not work correctly. This is why I believe so many people are saying it never worked out of the box or it couldn't connect. Its easy to get around and does not affect people not using encryption but it took me 5 hours to figure out. I have version 3.1 of the bridge and 2.15 of the firmware by the way. The way around this is to setup as directed. On the setup screen when you pick the bridge from your list don't click next just click on the name. This will bring you to a web interface. The default user name and password are admin and admin. go to the wireless encryption section and paste in the correct hex key. DO NOT PUT IN PASSPHRASE AND CLICK GENERATE. if you don't have the full hex key you can get your passphrase correctly translated here http://www.rkgage.net/bobby/wep.html. That should do it.Good luck.
2,Intermittent Wireless Connection,"I wanted to connect my new music server to my network and wanted to avoid running wires under the house. I tried this Linksys Wireless G ethernet bridge to connect it wirelessly.After three hours on the phone with Linksys Tech Support, they concluded that my first unit was defective, so I returned it to Amazon and ordered a replacement.The second unit worked - I was able to establish a wireless connection. Unfortunately, the reliability of the connection was very poor. It only seemed to be working for a few minutes and I eventually returned it and had to run an ethernet cable instead.Fortunately, Amazon allowed me to return both units and provided a refund.It's a great product in theory; but its execution left me disappointed."
1,Product barely worked,"After serveral hours of trying to get this product to work I was marginally successful. I attempted to install this product for use with my replaytv. I managed to get a signal for a short period of time. (a few hours) Then the product simply stopped working for my replaytv. I tried the product with my playstation with similar results.I tried visiting the support website, resetting the device and upgrading the firmware but nothing could make the device function properly"
1,"Setup is Poor, terrible customer support, hard to return","I bought this product and the wrt54gs router. The Linksys literature states that these two products can be used to have a wireless network. The literature states that these products are easy to hookup and configure. I spent four hours on my own and then four hours with Linksys tech support via live chat, no less than five support people, two of whom deliberately disconnected from me. I am not a newbie computer/network guy, I know what a gateway and loopback is, and these products do not work, and Linksys would not even give me an RMA. they refused to deal with me and make these products work. Never again will I purchase or recommend Linksys products. Terrible customer support.Product does not work as advertised."
1,died soon,"didn't configure out of the box. Had to call support.It died in about 6 weeks. Linksys quality has gone straight downhill since they were bought by Cisco. Routers last about 18 months, and cable modems last about 24 months. This lasted 6 weeks."
5,Linksys WET54G Wireless-G Ethernet Bridge,This product shipped right away and was received within a couple of days. It was easy to set up and use. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to use a wireless bridge instead of running a line to their game system or Directv receiver box (for On-Demand-Movies).
3,Setup more difficult than it should be,"Setup for the device was more difficult than it should have been. The device comes hard-coded with a 192.168.1.* static IP address, so the install program was repeatedly unable to find it, even when I patched it directly to my PC. I had to manually assign a static IP in that range to my laptop in order for the setup program to detect the bridge. The quickstart guide was rubbish.Also, mac owners beware: you won't be able to run the setup CD."
2,"Bad experience, might have been a fluke.","We're Linksys lovers...if Linksys makes it we have it. We bought some of these to give our IP phones some freedom. My guys carry actual phone system IP phones on the road so we can have a full on office wherever they are. These didn't work good, the little Linksys black box without external antenna works great. Go for that one."
3,"Fair, you really need to play with it",Simply put this works but you have to play with it. I found that it was terrible at holding signal when there was anything in between the bridge and the source. Sure it will connect but drop outs were frequent. Now that there is a mostly clear LOS to the source I'm not having nearly the same amount of issues.For regular browsing this unit is great. You shouldn't have any major issues. For gaming I think there may be better alternatives. This will work but make sure you have clear LOS or you'll be having some serious packet loss issues and disconnects.
1,"owned the wet11 for 7 yrs, this one stopped in 18 months","Good product, crappy doc and support. Best example is the password for the online interface. It is listed as Admin ""BLANK"" password ""admin""... well you must use admin/admin to get in. After spending 2 hours on that it certainly tainted my view of the product :-). Other then that it is a real pain to change the default IP address for the home network our of the 192.168....This unit stopped working in 18 months. No power no nothing.. put my wet11 back to work and its all good.Make sure you turn off Norton firewall and ""worm"" protection or you won't see it on your network."
1,Another worthless linksys product!,"Limitations placed on setting up the equipment render it useless for me. And Linksys has the worst customer service I have ever experienced, I believe it is time they raise their standards and hire people with at minimum a high school degree. Last time I bought a linksys product I said that would be the last time, and here I find myself again buying a linksys product again, and nothing has changed."
1,Just doesn't work,"Constantly drops the connection with the wireless network. Bought it for my sling box, as I didn't have a wired connection near the TV. Works sparingly at best before dropping the signal and needing to be reset."
3,It's meh.,The WET54G pretty much does what you'd expect. It's a perfectly workable Wireless Ethernet Bridge for Wireless-G. It's a little easy to overload with data though. It might have been better to design this thing to support a consistant stream of data at Wireless G rates.
4,Worked Great for my Mac and PS3,"Just plugged it into my imac, no software install or anything. Synced right up with my linksys router. Same for my PS3. no problems and works great!!!"
4,Happy with Ethrnet bridges,"I bought two of these to upgrade my home network to WPA and get the benefit of wireless G speeds. I received the order in about three days. Setup was easy with the CDs provided and WPA encryption was easily configured. As a Linux user, I would like to have know that initial setup can only be down through Windows. However they worked well with Linux after setup. After I got them up and running, they are giving reliable service and fast downloads."
1,linksys WET54G Wireless-G Ethernet Bridge,Never worked. Did not see on the Network to set up. Sent back via RMA. The next new replacement unit never was able to go from AD HOC to normal mode. This product was returned.Needs to have MUCH Better Doc. I would never buy this product. But the experience was great with Amazon. They did RMA and return well.
2,All but one thing,"Works fine, unless you use a Hidden SSID as part of your security. This device can not deal with Hidden SSIDs, otherwise it is easy to setup and great. It took two calls to tech support for me to finally realize that when I stopped hiding my SSID that it worked fine, when I hid it again it stopped. Finally the tech said, yeah this does not work with hidden SSIDs.So, if you don't care about hiding your SSID, it is a fine unit."
2,This thing is crud,"I like linksys products typically. In fact I was really upset when Verizon FIOS switched me to their proprietary router. But this wireless bridge was ALWAYS acting up. I could never get it to stay connected to the network for more than 24 hours. It's like everytime it tried to renew it's IP, it died. And the weird thing was, I couldn't cycle the power on the surge protector; I HAD to pull the pluc out of the WET and then plug it back in. When it DID work, it worked as advertised. But it was always killing the connection."
4,Works well after the setup,As many other have said in their reviews the documentation is extremely poor. However after having read many of the reviews and all the tips people left I was able to get the device set up fairly quickly. The performance of the bridge was actually better than I expected. My main use was for an XBox 360 for online gaming. I was surprised to have a solid connection and no noticeable lag during a large multiplayer game on a Friday night. I also have a switch hooked off of the bridge and have no problems running several devices.
1,WET54G,The unit only works for one computer. I wanted to use to couple to a splitter so I coulld have two computers working and it does not do that and customer service at Linksys was mostly useless and they recommended getting this device without telling me it was so limited in functionality. I returned the product for credit. I do not recommend using linksys products. The 3Wire wirless router works very well. I would use the 3 Wire and Belkin receivers for all your needs.
1,WET54G Does Not Work as Indicated,"I am usually very high on Linksys products but this item was not useful at all. It was to be used to bridge the wireless signal about 100 feet from my house into my shop so I could utilize my computer in the shop. Unfortunately even at 50 ft away this unit could not connect. My shop computer never got a signal from it even at close distances. The configuration of this unit is rather vague and it may have needed some code to engage it but the directions did not tell me. I was very disappointed in this unit as it was advertised to do the job, one that it could not do."
2,It does not work well with Canon multifunction printers,"I had hoped to buy this wireless ethernet bridge so that I could place my Canon printer/copier in the garage, without having to use a long ethernet cable.My hopes were dashed, when the product arrived and I set it up. The printer would not be visible on my home network unless I rebooted the ethernet bridge and printer. It would stay visible for a minute or so. After that the ethernet bridge and printer required re-booting!Overall, it was a bad experience."
1,"setup not confusing, just impossible","The setup wizard doesn't even see the bridge. Cable is good, proven by making IP connection to brdge. So no problem, right? Just use the handy web utility for setup. Nope. The stated password is not accepted.This is a v3. I don't think a firmware upgrade is going to help because there's no way (at least for the customer) to get the new firmware in.The final suggestion from their Tech Support waas to return it as defective and try another unit. This was the same suggestion they had for a non-functional WUSB54G. I guess they must be shipping a lot of defective units."
2,"Doesn't work, period.","I purchased this ethernet bridge and spent about a week trying to get it to function to no avail. I tried to find solutions to get the unit to work by going to the Linksys site as well as researching solutions online, and finally found that Amazon had sent me a model with older firmware. Evidently, the newer firmware resolves many problems. I returned it to Amazon for a refund. However, since there was nothing wrong with the unit other than it having old firmware, I only received a partial refund.Buyer Beware! Check the firmware version BEFORE you buy!Why 2 stars? Linksys products are generally good and work well. But they must be shipping their old stock out to vendors to get rid of it."
4,Works well but documentation could be better,Wireless bridge works as advertised but the setup documentation fails to explain that you must configure your workstation's network interface prior to accessing the unit's web interface. I am using the unit to acccess a WPA protected access point. Once configured the product is very solid and I have not had any problems.
4,Works Great! Setup a bit confusing.,"I was able to get the bridge up and running with my Sony Playstation 2 in about an hour. The documentation was a little misleading and tells you to use the setup utility to configure the bridge. Since my router is using WEP encryption on key 3 I couldn't use the setup utility since it only allows you to specify encryption on key 1. I recommend using the admin web interface utility to set up the bridge. Then things becmoe very easy. I have not had any connection problems with this like I have seen in the other reviews. One down side is that the is no new firmware update for the WET54G to allow for WPA security, which is currently available for the WRT54g (wireless router) and the WPC54g (wireless notebook card)."
1,Garbage product and garbage support,"These units are pieces of scrap. we have 8 WET54G ver 1.1 units and all give flahsing power symptoms after snmp or UDP scans. Firwmare version 2.06 was supposed to fix this, BUT DID NOT. Linksys refuses to return money or send better/updated units...they will send 3 more of the same...what good is that? 3 more pieces of garbage is still garbage. Linksys support is also garbage....nobody knows anything, but I'll bet they're still selling this SCRAP aren't they?Totally ticked off, and will never buy another LINKSYS product again...IF YOU'RE READING THIS LINKSYS, THEN TAKE HEED. YOUR REPUTATION IS TURNING TO GARBAGE..MY CASE NUMBER IS 2374421. THANKS FOR NOTHING"
1,I Should Have Listened to The Bad Reviews,"I currently have an 802.11b network and WET11 from Linksys. The system works great. When I read the bad reviews here I thought that it couldn't be true. I am writing to assure everyone that the bad reviews about this product are absolutely on the money. Poor connection, slow speed (slower than 802.11b if you are farther than 20 feet away), buggy software and no WPA! Do not buy this product. I had just purchased all new Linksys hardware to upgrade to 802.11g. I am returning it all. It's too bad - I have been turned from a Linksys supporter to a detractor. Now if there are any other wireless hardware manufacturers reading this - make a 802.11g wireless bridge. I will buy your bridge, router and notebook adapter right now. Good-bye Linksys!"
1,One more unhappy buyer,"I read the negative reviews on this bridge, but bought it anyway, thinking that my years of experience with home networking and with Linksys products would pull me through. Wrong, wrong, WRONG! After two long hours of resetting IP addresses, rebooting my computer, resetting the wireless defaults, etc., etc., I gave up and got a return label from good ol' Amazon. Next day, impatient, I browsed the shelves at B**t B*y for something similar and picked up a ""Buffalo Wireless-G MIMO Performance Ethernet Converter."" Five minutes of setup was all it took to have my HP network printer/scanner up and running as a wireless unit! Linksys dropped the ball big time this one."
2,Is it G or B?,"I had one heck of a time getting this to work with my WRT54G wireless router, and the reason for the difficulty is I couldn't get a connection when my router runs in G-only mode. When I set the router to mixed (b and g) mode it works fine. I'm not sure how this is an improvement over the cheaper WET11 B bridge. Interestingly, the WiFi certification label on the box indicates this is interoperable only with 2.4Ghz at 11Mbps and not 54Mbps.How do they get away with calling it 2.4GHz/54Mbps?"
4,Works with iMac,"I have an older iMac with no airport card. This product attaches to the ethernet port and performs well. The instructions are not ""Mac friendly"" but there is lots of help on the internet."
1,Bad technology,"I bought this bridge to connect to my Linksys Wireless-G Router (WRT54G). No matter what configuration settings I used, the two would not communicate unless they were connected via the Ethernet cable. All I wanted to do was connect my Ethernet enabled printer to the wireless network from the next room over. Maybe you need two bridges and have one physically plugged into the router and the other plugged into the network on the other side (in this case my printer). But then you have to fork over more than [the price](for two bridges) to do so. Linksys documents that the bridge will communicate with a wireless access point. Isn't the wireless router just a router that contains the wireless access point built in? The WET54G should communicate with the WRT54G wirelessly, and they do not."
1,Set up was a nightmare - never got it working quite right,"We've had the unit for about 8 months, and it's flakey as anything. Starting from the very beginning, it was a nightmare to set up and get online. The Wizard thing that came with it did not work at all. It still doesn't. After googling and finding the default details of the thing, I was able to log in directly and figure out how to set it up, but someone with less technical savvy wouldn't stand a chance. Even once it was set up, it has never worked reliably. When it does work at all, it's slow. In the end, we gave up and just got a powerline networking thing which has worked perfectly."
4,Great product,It was just what the Dr ordered and arrived in excelent condition. Bothour Net Fix and laptops now get great signal with the repeater.
4,"Easy to install, works as billed",The bridge was simple to install and has worked well since we have has it installed. It is controlling a HP Deskjet printer that is used in a classroom and gets a good amount of use. It continues to work well and I would not hesitate to purchase another one if the need arose.
1,Piece of Junk,I echo all of the comments below. I've burned more time with customer support than this thing is worth.
1,Very unreliable!,"I have to join the chorus of negative reviews of this product. I bought the WET54G and the WRT54G to replace a non-standard (RadioLan) wireless connection. My first suspicion that this might not be a quality product was when I noticed the Ethernet plug wouldn't lock into place. I thought the install was straightforward, and I was initially please with the speed and reliability, but after several days of continuous use the connection began to get fairly flaky, and finally the unit couldn't detect ANY of the numerous wireless networks that suround me. In the meantime, my Apple iBook sitting 3 feet away had no problem setting up a reliable link to the WRT54g. I have more money then time, and didn't want to hassle with customer support, so I foolishly bought a 2nd unit, thinking perhaps I had just picked up a lemon. Same symptoms: an initial honyemoon, increasing unreliability, and finally total failure. I STRONGLY advise against this item."
1,It works however......,I found out that this locks up my router every time I hooked this device up when I had to configure it. This is when I had to hook this up to my laptop directly. I did look on linksys' site and they have 2 versions of this bridge only found on their download section. The one that I got was the v1.1 which many people on this board may have written about this particular version. (...)
3,Set-up for X-Box or anything else is tricky.,"I never got the CD-ROM that came with my WET54G to work, recomend it be used as a coaster. Go directly to 192.168.1.226 to configure it. Make sure to keep track of the ""X"" and ""II"" switch on the back. I didn't have any problems accessing the WET54G when hooked directly to my PC or to my WRT54G and going to the IP address directly, the Linksys software (on supplied CD-ROM)never did find my WET54G even when hooked directly to my PC. Note: My PC is hard-wired to the WRT54G, always configure the WET54G using wire, even after you have it up and running. Mine now bridges X-Box to the WRT54G and works very well. Also Note: I had to disable all my SECURITY on my WRT54G until I got past the basic configuration. Add security back into your net 1 piece at a time (i.e. SSID broadcast, WEP, MAC filtering, and etc.) until all is up to the level you need it to be."
5,Works great.,"The first thing you need to do is upgrade the firmware with the latest version available in the linksys web site.I have it connected with a Kiss DP-500 player's ethernet adapter, and it can play divx and mpeg movies across the wireless network (video files are located in my PC's hard disk, this PC is connected to the switch by 100 Mbps ethernet) with no problems.By the way, my wet54g is placed about 12 meters away from my wrt54g gateway, with 2 walls in between.The one important thing that is missing in this product is WPA security. Hopefully Linksys with release another firmware with support for it."
1,"If I could give it no stars, I would.","I have had my WET54G a total of 7 months and have had nothing but problems with it since I got it. At first they were minor, such as having to reset the device every couple of days, but things steadily got worse. Now the unit cannot even see the access point positioned less than ten feet way from it. I contacted their customer support. They had me reset and unplug the device in every possible combination imaginable (I am assuming they were trying to get the firmware to work). I ended up RMA'ing the unit only to receive another unit that is having the same problem. Get this: you have to pay the shipping to send the broken unit back! So I get to pay for shipping twice. With the money that I have spent on this unit, I could of had an electrician run a hard line."
4,good product,product is good. The status represent it is delivered but i received it after 2 days. No synchronisation in the status update.
5,Does what it's supposed to do,"Product works as it should. Had to format it for my PSP-slim but it holds a lot of data. It is noticeably slower with loading times than the 1GB memory stick was, but it is really not that bad and I got used to it pretty quickly. I have purchased Sandisk memory sticks in the past for use with digital cameras, and never had any trouble with them. They are just as good as the Sony branded ones and cost a lot less. Please note that this particular packaging does not include the memory stick adapter (which I already had from another memory stick and did not need) but it did come with a little protective case."
1,junk,"My memory card worked for about a month and then mysteriously stopped working, company doesn't care to help when you have a problem. It may be cheap but you get what you pay for. very disappointed."
5,Good product,"I love this product because I was able to download/upload more than 1,000 song onto this memory stick, save my game data from the PSP, videos pictures, and much more. It cost as little as 60-100 USD which is pretty cheap."
1,inoperable,the Chip was new in original factory sealed but it does not work. my phone or computer can not read it...
1,flimsy card,"We had to replace this card after it started cracking from pulling it in and out of the camera. I had always used a Sony card before, with never any cracking. Yes, the price is good, but quality not so good. Very hesitant to buy another one. Had the 4GB magic gate card for our Sony DSc-H5 camera."
4,Works fine,"Still a bit pricier than similar capacity SD, but if you're stuck with Sony, SanDisk always works well."
5,Great card,"I needed this for a Sony Camera that I bought and it is great. Lots of space. Exactly what I was looking for, much cheaper than the Sony cards."
5,EXCELLENT VENDOR!!!,Everything went perfectly. The product was what I expected. I would definately recommend this vendor for next purchases!!!
1,Slow,Not as fast as its equivalent original Sony product.Does the job well but if you see Sony at a similar price I would say buy the Sony.
4,It works great,"I gave it a 4 out 5 because it is very good, but let's admit it, is there anything perfect?Besides, I have only had it for abou a month, only time will tell if it is really good and lasting.Otherwise I recommend it."
3,Memory Stick,"I bought this for My PSP slim(Though it should used for camera devices), i have good enough storage."
2,Not fast enough for ReadyBoost,Good card but slow. It isn't fast enough for Vista's ReadyBoost feature.
4,"Got exactly what I paid for, no issues","The item was obviously part of a bulk pack at one time, but received in working condition and was what I expected. Decently fast shipping also was a plus."
4,Great Memory Stick,This is a great buy! The space is fantastic and the price cant be beat. It is alot more affordable than the Sony Memory Sticks and does the same thing. I use it in my PSP and it works perfectly. No complaints about this product.
5,Great for the PSP!,"This SanDisk memory card is great for people like me that has a PSP. For me, it's plenty of space for games, music, photos, etc. And the transfer rate is very pleasing. If you want a memory card that gets the job done and done fast then this is for you."
5,Excellent and highly useful product.,This hi-capacity memory stick was the best solution for dramatically increased storage capacity in my Sony DSC-T200 digital camera.Well worth the price for such a reliable device. Very pleased - 5 stars!
1,Did not last...,"I purchased this item along with an adapter for my Sony DSC-P10. 4GB was exactly what I needed! Unfortunately, after I printed out the pics saved and replaced the memory stick back in my camera, I received a formatting error. Maybe its me, I'm no tech genius. But I never had this problem with my original stick. Maybe I should have just downloaded the images from my camera to my pc and saved them to my flashdrive and printed them out from there? Is it just me or does it seem like a lot of extra steps to capture and print photos....Oh well, I guess I have to buy the real deal from Sony...so disappointing~"
3,"Good Product,Great on Price..But slow shipping",I bought this product it was intially scheduled for Dec 26 delivery but..took abt 10 days more.. might be due to volume of holiday sales..But otherwise great product.
5,Plenty of space,I got this for my PSP for games and movies I have 8 games on this memory stick and 3 emulators with their own games as well I also have 2 movies and about 50 songs....this is plenty of space for a very low price I recommend this product its a great buy.
3,no adapter included!,"Be careful with this -- the photo shows the memory stick adapter is included (I need the adapter so this will work in my camera). The card showed up in packaging that said ""adapter not included"". Rather than returning the memory card, I had to buy an adapter at the local Sony store. Factoring that in, there was no savings through Amazon.Other than that, the memory card works great in my Sony DSC-W5! I can take about an hour of hi-res video, and several hours of normal-res video."
5,Works fine for Sony Ericsson phone,"I bought this for my Sony Ericsson w810i phone. Works fine as a replacement for the memory stick that came with the phone, and has much more memory."
5,Works Just Fine for PSP,Both of my sons needed a memory sticks for their PSPs that they just got for Christmas. I ordered 1 for each PSP and they work perfectly.
5,Great memory for PSP,this is a nice addition for people with older PSP models. Since more games are becoming download only having more space is very welcome to store many games on your psp instead of having to switch umd discs.
5,Ample capacity on a really nice Mem Stick,"I purchased this Memory Stick a few weeks back and I'm verry happy with its performance and size. So far, I cannot find any difference between this one & the SanDisk Ultra II that I bought after it. Works GREAT in both my PSP and in my Cybershot DSCP100 (with the included adapter) Absolutely recomend this SanDisk to other Sony users."
5,Works great,I bought two of these 4G memory cards for my older Sony camera. With the adapter I also purchased they work great.
5,A lot of memory,I bought this for my PSP. I was able to get all of MP3's on it (hundreds) and I still have plenty of room left over for all my video game saves and all my other personal settings and files. Now my PSP is like a tiny little laptop with all the things I can do with it now. I should have bought it sooner.
5,So far so good!,Works great in my PSP playing music and games perfectly. I can actually fit 7 games on the card and they all play great with no issues. Amazon deliverd quick and great price. Definatley a must have for any person with a hacked PSP.
5,Sandisk 4GB MemoryStick PRO Duo,"As always, in my experience, Sandisk memory products work as described and at least as well as other suppliers - even the original equipment manufacturer.This item is no different. Other than the ""SanDisk"" logo on the packaging and the unit, you'd be hard pressed to tell this memory stick apart from one supplied by Sony. It functions in the units I have that take this type of memory - no special formatting or configuration necessary. It's recognized the first time I insert it, and every time thereafter, without any problems."
5,Good product,"As usual, the sony memory sticks have always been a good product. Have had to buy several over the years, and they are great."
5,great!,the order arrived on time. this chip fits perfect with my Sony camera! will definately order again. Thanks a lot
5,Great item,This was exactly what I was looking for. Loved the price and how easy it was to find and use.
3,"!!!Don't get ""free"" reader!!!","Chip works fine. HOWEVER:You can get a reader for ""free"" with the chip, but when you plug it into a Windows box, the OS doesn't recognize it. It may actually cause problems with other systems. It caused other USB storage devices no longer recognizable during my attempts.I contacted the company and they sent me an RMA. The RMA states that there will be a 10-20% restocking fee plus $5 change (I don't get this!). But, since I got this for ""free"" (+$1.50 shipping charge!), I would be in the red.THE ""FREE"" READER'S NOT FREE!!!DON'T GET IT!!!"
3,Card for you PSP :),"Works fine it my kid's PSP. I wish I could use it in other things, in a pinch. But at least it is cheap."
4,"fine purchase, slow delivery","It arrived fine but no notification that it was shipped, I was beginning to wonder, it had been longer than stated. It would have been nice to have an update before it was delivered."
5,BIen,"Original, y exactamente lo que pedi. Contenta con la experiencia de compra. Recibido en excelentes condiciones. Saludos desde Venezuela. Gracias"
5,Excelent,"The product arrived in perfect condition without any problem, the package is the right size to what you buy, it works nicely, place it in my camera and ready to take pictures."
5,SanDisk 4gb menory stick pro duo flash memory card,"Package arrived in well protected container. easy to open. This memory was purchased to outfit a camera that I was selling to a friend. All in all. Good transaction!! Thanks, Randy"
5,Works and looks exactly like the picture.,"Lots of usuable memory, only problem is that like most memory cards it doesn't carry the full 4 gig memory, just slightly less. Still its a bunch of memory space for your PSP or whatever you use this for."
3,Morton Smith Wannabe,"Roscoe's dependence on ""Clement of Alexandria and a Secret Gospel of Mark"" by Morton Smith as the only source for same-sex ceremony in early Christianity is worrisome; could he not find other documents that witnessed the same thing, instead of depending on customs of Greek philosophy to fill in the gaps of his theory? Roscoe does as much, without knowing it, to prove the validity of the Mormon temple ceremony as he does his own point--and both proof are conjecture based of circumstantial evidence."
5,Charming Wholesome and Sweet,"My daughter and I listened to the audio book of Lucy Rose Big On Plans and we both loved it. Lucy Rose lives in Washington D. C. with her mother Lily, just around the corner from her Grandparents Madam and Pop. Her parents have recently separated and her father lives in Michigan. Lucy is charming and lovable as is the rest of her family. I'm especially fond of her grandparents Madam and Pop.Lucy Rose chronicles her summer in her diary offering a word of the day (which I loved). She has to deal with a new girl at Parks and Rec. who is not so nice and she struggles to come to grips with her parents impending divorce.I loved the smart and sensitive personality that Katy Kelly gives Lucy Rose, she's not a whiner or disrespectful like I sometimes find other characters intended for this audience (Judy Moody for example).I really loved this story it's funny, sweet and serious as well.We will be looking for all of Lucy Rose's adventures."
5,Wonderful,"I enjoyed this very much. I heard it on the TV and searched it out on Amazon for purchase, I would like to find more of their work."
4,Fundamentals of Project Management,"Fundamentals of Project Management (Worksmart)I needed to have a general knowledge about project management and found this book to be clear, simple, easy to understand and gave me all the basics. It is good for some one who wants to start working in this field."
2,OK but really really basic stuff,"Covers the basics -- but if you have ever read any other book on project management, or managed a project yourself, or worked for a company that has a formal project management process, or gone to a 1-day seminar on project management -- this is not for you. There's nothing wrong with this book, it's very thorough, balanced and well-thought out, but it is definitely aimed at beginners."
5,A book a lot of people can read.,"I have been trying for some time to get people on my company to read about Project Management, with no success: even if they start, they don't read more than a few chapters. This book has an exceptional advantage over many other books: It is short, instructive, readable, and fun.In the last three months, I have convinced four people to read this book, lending to them the copy I bought for the company, and two of them bought a copy for themselves (I almost forgot: it is also very inexpensive :-) ). Afterwards, most of them say that the book does not contain any secrets, but it provides an excellent framework on PM, and wets their appetite for this discipline.By the way, some of the best books on PM I have read come from Amacom. I'd recommend Team Based Project Management, also by James Lewis, and another great book is Information Systems Project Management, by Hallows."
3,The highlight only apply to senior,"This one is very general about some guidelines in project management without any step-by-step instruction for how to achieve. If you are a beginner, this one might be not suitable for you, go for Sunny Baker's one called IDIOT, which is the best one for beginner and senior."
5,Excellent information for anyone,"This book provides some basics which anyone can use. Even if you use it just for your own work, it outlines some common sense steps which everyone should follow. I have lent it to several coworkers and all have found it useful."
3,"An ""OK"" reference","This was a required book for my doctorate. However, I never used it... the material just wasn't pertinent to what I was doing. It is fairly simplistic with common sense thrown in. Unless it is required, I would not bother buying this book."
5,Perfect example of what a fine photography book should be.,This book represents all the finest points of an excellent photography book. It is well written and imformative for the novice to the professional. You will find only the highest quality work throughout the book. It covers everything from black and white to color picture taking to final print development. The hundreds of photographs that illustrate each aspect of photography are beautiful. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
3,Not my favorite tasting extra virgin olive oil,I ordered this from Amazon several years ago and it was excellent. But more recently I ordered it directly from the source in California and I found it to be untasty. Not sure what happened. Perhaps a bad batch. I gave the product 3 stars which is half way between the two extremes due to the two experiences. I need to use evoo for medicinal purposes and consume it as it as bottled. I use a shotglass every few days. The last bottle of this made that impossible as it was so bitey that it made me uncomfortable. I've found other brands that tasted much more smooth. Plus it was rather expensive. At $23 for 16.9 oz delivered I found the price to be a little high for the lack of quality control. I don't wish to bad-mouth the product. And I realize each person has their own particular favorites. I only wanted to share my experience.
2,green taste,"while this oil has a bold flavor it is very green, tastes like chewing on a leaf almost, maybe that is the intention for this olive oil but i prefer a nuttier-flavored olive oil"
5,Good quality,"I bought this olive oil on a recommendation that it is truly cold pressed, unlike others that claim to be cold pressed but are not. I couldn't realy tell the difference in flavor but I liked it and will buy more."
4,good bubble bath & scent free!,"BodyTime bubble bath is not the bubbliest on the market but it's pretty good, and it's the only one I've found without a bunch of crappy perfumes!"
1,Save your money!,"The Mozart effect research was done with ""Adults"". Some studies show that ""adults"" get smarter within 15 minutes after listen to Mozart. Some studeis show that it does not make an adults smarter. It does not work. Listen to this to make yourself feel better, but the fact remains: This will not make your baby smarter."
2,The Tuber Without Skill,"This book did little to advance my current knowledge of float tube fly fishing. Mr. Alley has clearly fished a lot and seems to understand how to fly fish from the float tube. I guess that some might feel that simply fishing a lot qualifies you to write a book. But I think this book should stand to illustrate the fallacy of that notion, you also need something interesting and unique to say."
3,A good book for beginners,"I'm not certain what the term ""Advanced"" in this book's title means. I suppose that it might mean that Mr. Alley assumes you can inflate a float tube on your own...Otherwise, the book covers structure, potential locations of warm water fish during their life cycle and a pretty basic list of suggestions of how to position your float tube for various types of lake fishing."
5,Fast Cap Kolbe Corners,Thanks to Amazon I got them quickly when I needed them. They worked very well for what I was doing and customer was very happy how they blended in.
3,Good but overpriced,"This is a good basic laser pointer, but I have since seen it on sale in a shop for half the price!"
2,can't dance.....slip n slide,this dance mat slips and slides.. and it's hard to see which star is lit up...my kids played with it once and gave up...
2,"Selling his training method, no techniques in the book","This book doesn't cover very much of anything useful in a fight, it's mostly anecdotal stories and selling his training at his school in colorado. Interesting read, and somewhat informative, but disappointing because it never discusses any methods one can use (except to come to his school in colorado and train for real.)"
3,"Nice looking, but cats unimpressed","This really is a nice looking scratching post, and from a human's perspective, cats should love it.We have two cats, and they both sniffed it and then completely ignored it. Given the cost of it, I gave it to a friend who has four cats, hoping she would have better luck. Unfortunately, her cats were unimpressed too.I give this three stars because the post really is nicely made, and the concept is great. It just didn't work for my cats, sad to say."
3,Not bad for the price,"there are better easier to use programs but this isn't bad for the price. Produce calendars, brochures, business cards and more but be patient."
1,Doesn't convert to word document!,"I have this program and yes, you can do a lot with it. If you just need to produce a couple of items. it is fine. But I have created brochures for my small business and decided that rather than deal with producing them all the time I would have a printer run them. Generally, printers want the document in Word. WELL...NO CAN DO! You cannot convert these documents to word. You can save them in PDF, but not Word! I purchased the program, I created the document and I SHOULD be able to save it in Word or, whatever program I want. But, no. Can't be done. I will never EVER buy another software product fromt these people again."
2,ultimate ? Whoa! blue boy ! I think NOT,"disappointing on the second read. No mention of their best system ""anticipation"" by wayne griffith as tracked by future truth magazine. I respect what John Hill has accomplished and George's programming prowess and trading know how. But it does not come out in this book. My impression is that the book tosses out a few ideas and random thoughts but I did not come away saying ""whoopee"" i see the light ! Most of the ideas are not tradeable without considerable thought and pre-existing market wisdom. Tossing out portfolio tests without insight is like saying look guys my excalibur programs can run this type of analysis...so what...WHERES' THE BEEF ?"
5,It is the ultimate - but not for everyone.,"12 out of 10. But not for everyone. The book is designed to help ~you~ develop a trading system, it does not hand one out to you on a platter. Actually it does serve up many, many, many different systems, tests them, explains them in extreme detail to the point that you could computerise them (if you have that skill) however you won't find any of them work wonders.If however you are very skilled you will get a lot of inspiration from this book. For example, if you are already very advanced, and have developed your own systems either in your head or on computer.If you are a beginner / novice you might be completely overwhelmed.Read the other reader reviews and you'll see generally those who are experienced loved it, those new to trading wanting easy answers hated it / disappointed.It is one of the few books I am reluctant to promote because I don't want the secrets in it to get out - ha! oh well hopefully most people won't get it."
5,The Ultimate Trading Guide: A must.,"I have read The Ultimate Trading Guide by John Hill, George Pruitt and Lundy Hill with much pleasure. It is one of the best books I have read on the subject. It is clearly written and gives you the tools to design trading systems. It also is realistic and does not promise you The Holy Grail. I have learned a lot from it."
5,great taste omaha,"easy to use when you don't want to mess with fresh garlic. love the blend, nice size and easy to pour."
3,"Good for R, bad for stats","As an introduction to R, this book is very good. It's much clearer than the R documentation that comes with the code, and satisfied most of my needs. The statistical text was not very helpful, however. Discussion is very brief, and several points that would seem important are dismissed as beyond the scope of the work. I wasn't able to get a handle on the statistical tests I wasn't familiar with to begin with. The ideal audience for the book is people who know the stats already, and would like to learn R."
3,"Good overall, but missing key elements.","The book provides good examples of how to run various types of functions and models in R. It could, however, better address the issue of how to import data from large pre-existing datasets into a format R can read. If an external program, such as Sed or Awk, is needed to prepare common file structures (rectangular or hierarchical) beforehand, it would be nice to know this up front. The book lives up to its claim that it provides a subset of information that R beginners may find useful and that it is not a definitive guide. The reader should beware, however, that while it gives a fairly thorough description of built-in R functionality, it may not be sufficient."
4,Clear but basic,A great introduction to those interested in getting to know R. However this is not a stats book so don't buy it expecting instruction for which stats test to use - you will still need a comprehensive statistics book to accompany this.
2,Kindle Edition Is Not The Latest,"The Kindle edition of this title is the first edition c2004, whereas the latest print edition is the second edition c2008 and has been updated for R 2.6.2 with new material added. I wish Amazon was better about updating Kindle versions of prior editions."
5,"Fast shipping, good quality. Thanks!",The shipping is fast and the book arrived in good quality. I appreciate it very much. Thanks!
3,Terrific Survey of the Life of Christ,Bob Stein's survey of the life of Christ stands out among other works on the Gospels in the way he summarizes both the teaching and the life of Jesus. It is remarkable how much helpful material Stein is able to include in a relatively brief book.
2,synoptic sadness,"This book is hard to understand, the author goes all over the place. A lot of it is the subject matter but wow what a confusing explanation of how to study the life of Jesus. If it wasn't required by my professor I wouldn't be reading it."
2,This is the miniature edition!?,"This is the miniature edition!? It fits in the palm of my hand - miniature. I guess I should read the full product description before hitting the purchase button, eh? To say the least, I was disappointed. I have never really understood the purpose of miniature books and it looks rather silly on my book shelf next to the ""regular-sized"" books."
3,would rather read lombardi himself,"the book made lombardi's lessons seem trite, to me at least. it's a quick read, but I'd rather read Lombardi in his own words."
2,not his father,I didn't enjoy this book. I didn't even finish it. It is Lombardi's son who wrote the book. It just wasn't very interesting to me.
4,Great Book,"Great insight from the person that knew Vince best, his son. Valuable insight on what made the man such a great leader."
1,WHAT IT TAKE TO BE #1,"This book does not interelate leadership with the actual stories of Green Bay Packer championships or the individual players. With the exception of the Ice Bowl (which could been described in more detail along with other stories), the book was a complete disappointment."
5,Being #1,"This book is a must have for not only any entrepreneur, but anyone is the MLM field. It is so hard to believe in yourself, but when you see the strength of character is Vince Lombardi you see the best leader their has ever been."
2,Read the fine print!,The book is not at all what I wanted. It is more of a gift book than the actual book. It's a small inept version of the real thing. Verify the correct version before ordering would be my advice.
2,Could be better...,"We had this book and the Lonely Planet 4th edition on a bike trip along the Friendship Highway. If Lonely Planet didn't have a much better guidebook this one would be better than nothing, but it poorly indexed and organized."
3,"Good rack, but picture is not accurate","The pictured rack is not what you get. If you were to place two racks side by side your guitars on the end would practically bump into each other. Also, though the picture looks like wood or at least simulated wood, the rack is black plastic (to be fair, the description mentions this).I was planning on using three racks and putting them flush against each other to hold nine guitars; this is not possible with this product unless you were to space the racks apart from each other."
4,Great first step to Mozart,This cd is a great way to introduce your baby to Mozart. My son loves it.
4,"Useful, well organized reference.",Evidently a co-worker liked it too because they walked-off-with-it. I miss not being able to refer to it. I'm back to buy a second copy.
3,"Not as good as I had hoped for, but useful.",I thought it was pretty basic but at times it has helped with writers block. A supplement to your basic thesaurus based on ideas rather than one for one word comparisons. John - Eagle Stock Images
2,Disappointed,"I had expected far more than I got. I wanted to read of some research, and examples of campaigns that had worked using the suggested words. It's nothing like that. It's just a compilation of words and expressions. Good luck figuring out which ones might be of any benefit to your marketing effort."
3,Words that sell,"Differant than expected, but will work. Haven't had time or need to use it yet. Came in very good condition."
4,I'm Sold!,"This book teaches the importance of word choice when marketing a product or service, and many colleges do not offer such a course. Bayan does a great job, and even those with marketing expertise could benefit from this book. I recommend that you read this along with Levine's Guerrilla P.R. to really grasp the marketing concept."
1,A book for hacks only,"I was given this book as a gift a few years back -- not as a ""hey, this will really help you"" kind of gift, but as a ""hey, look at this pathetic joke"" sort of white elephant.This is not a book to be taken seriously. It's a collection of advertising's oldest, hoariest cliches. If you aspire to create ads for used car tent sales or TV-and-VCR-repair correspondence schools, you might find it marginally useful.On the other hand, if you want to create meaningful creative work and have a successful career at a prestigious advertising agency, you might check your work against this book to make sure that NOTHING you've written appears in its pages.It's a hacktacular book by a hack, meant for other hacks. If you want to be a hack, by all means click on that little shopping cart doohickey."
5,HELPFUL,I was very impressed with the way this book was presented. It was well set out and full of great words. A must for any copywriter.
5,Fantastic First for a New Author,"Wonderful read. Loveable characters make this an unforgettable read. The only adice I can offer is, don't start to read it unless you have time to finish it, I couldn't put it down. I will be watching future publications by this talented writer."
4,A fun book,"I think the Kittens series are a lot of fun. After all how many times can you read boy meets girl, boy doesn't get girl till the last pages. The Kitten series adds a fun new twist to this tired old genre. I suggest if you are tired of the kitten books you stop buying them, but please don't insist that those of us who like them, not be allowed to get them."
1,Yuck,"I buy romance books for romance between two PEOPLE not sickly, sentimental, cutsey animal stoies. I wish Zebra would stop with the kitten books already."
4,"FUNNY, WITTY AND, YES, IT SIZZLES!","This one is loaded with humor even though the beginning is far from it. Our hero is good looking and a bad boy waiting for redemption and our heroine is more than up to the job even if she does lack confidence. For some reason it took me awhile to get into this book (I don't know why), but once I was there I couldn't put it down. Good plot and good characterization with interesting secondary characters. I don't know about the rest of the books in this trilogy (Michael's story, etc.), but this one is a KEEPER. Enjoy."
4,"Good Story, Two Major Mistakes","This story is about the power of missionaries to start a stone rolling which they cannot control. Missionaries in New Zealand tried to convert the warlike Maori natives (who killed and ate their enemies) to a passive style of Christianity. Unfortunately, one man who was exiled to a remote island spent time reading the ""Old Testament"" and found himself more like the Israelites. Taking over a ship and bringing 'his' people back to their homeland made him a 'Moses' like character.Having led his people over the sea to freedom, he was determined to create his own 'holy land'. He never called his people Jews nor did he use the six-sided 'star of david' as his symbol. He named his people the ""Ringatu"" or 'raised hand' which was their symbol. There are still 16,000 adherents in modern New Zealand and they are considered a 'christian sect' because they recognize Jesus. The title of the story is nothing if not hyperbole and a way for the author to sell his book.Zeb Kantrowitz"
5,ok,"Fast, smooth transaction. Okay cartridge. Have some different saying and card options. I have had the cartridge for a while now and honestly don't use it as much as I thought I would. Shapes & saying are a little generic."
5,Just Outstanding!,"I had this book on the shelf for almost a year before reading it. What a mistake to wait! William Bernstein, a noted financial writer (and physician) describes the economic history and factors that made our world so wealthy in just the last two centuries. Highly readable history and economics all wrapped together. Excellent!"
5,Wonderful Book for any budding economists,"I absolutely loved this book, the first, second, and third time I read it. It stitches together the tapestry of world history, and the rise and fall of nations and peoples, amidst an economic background, far better than any other book I've ever read.Very easy to read for the lay person who is just interested in economics and history.Answers ""Yali's Question"" from Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" far better and more completely than that author ever did, I'm sad to say. Yali, a New-Guinea tribesman, had asked Mr. Diamond, ""Why are we New Guinean's so poor, and you white American's so rich?"" (slightly paraphrased.)A wonderful book to spend the weekend with for the history or economics buff."
5,Fantastic book,"A superb achievement for a one volume economic history of the world. Highly readable. Puts ""everything"" into perspective, in particular our naive conviction that things like economic growth, inflation and ""progress"" somehow have always been there and somehow and will always happen, no matter how destructive our economic and social policies are. Plainly not true as you will learn from this book. The book also convincingly shows why the 3rd world is where it is economically (and that's not due to colonialism). Congratulations to Bill Bernstein for this wonderful work which I hope will find many readers."
5,Excellent book on the history of economic growth,The Birth of Plenty is a truly excellent book on the history of economic growth. I recommend it very highly. Next on my reading list isA Splendid Exchangeby the same author.
5,Essential Economic History for Any Discipline,"Everyone who yearns for a better time in our past should read this book (and some others) to gain an appreciation how much wealthier and better off we are then 99% of our recorded history. This books not only describes our road to wealth, but gives the fundamental reasons why we all live so much longer, healthier, and better then anytime in the past. Essential."
4,Excellent introduction,"I own other books by Gadalla and this one is of similar quality, with the exception that this is only 27 pages. With such a small book, it is impossible to cover any subject exhaustively. But, that said, Gadalla manages to provide an excellent introduction to the correlation between Sacred Geometry and Numerology. He also covers how all this fits in with what he terms ""Egyptian Harmony"". For further study on Egyptian Harmony, read his books ""Egyptian Harmony"" and ""Egyptian Rhythm"".This, and Miranda Lundy's ""Sacred Geometry"", are good first steps on the road to understanding Sacred Geometry. For a more exhaustive study, you can then tackle Leonora Leet's ""The Universal Kabbalah"". Leet focuses on Sacred Geometry as it relates to the Jewish Kabbalah. Gadalla, by contrast, is of Egyptian descent and, predictably, focuses on ancient Egyptian (Kemet) influences."
1,Does not work with my Nokia,"I had a similar no name brand version of this USB phone charger that I used for several years with a couple different phones (including my current Nokia 8801). Recently the wire finally wore out and it was time to replace it.I was at work and desperate for a replacement so I found and bought this Philips multi-charger. I've tried the charger using the usb plug (what I mainly wanted), and the included wall plug, but neither work. When I plug the phone in it beeps like it is starting to charge then displays ""Not Charging"".The store I bought it from will not take it back and I can't be bothered to try and have it serviced through Philips. I have used the wall-plug usb adapter with other usb charging cables, so I guess it's not a complete loss. But I cannot recommend this product - instead go with a $1.99 cheapie from ebay."
3,Roman military History the easy way,"An easy to follow history of the three Punic Wars between Rome ad Carthage. Not with historic pictures of ruins etc. But supportedby reanact actors and a small portian of computer animations and maps.A bit amaturistic, but you get the picture.Supported by good comments of historians. Maps are very simple and show no detail. Army formations only shortly explained.A bit old doc (90's), as you will see by cloths of the historians.50 minutes of easy history, nothing spectacular.Not interesting for the experianced amature historian.Nice for interested (older) kids.From: a Dutch vieuwer (sorry for misspellings)"
5,If you need some super ideas...,"I really cannot say enought about this book - it is so great. It goes through a bunch of ways you can use paper to make your scrapbooks look totally great. I was in a total slump and this rejuvinated my pages 100%. I am usually not a fan of Memory Makers, either. This book is as good or better than any Creating Keepsakes/ Becky Higgins book. I have already won 2 contests using page ideas found in this book. You won't be disappointed, I promise."
5,Great Resource for scrapper who wants some new techniques,"I purchased this after seeing it in a Michael's store - had been impressed with the creative use of making louvers and frames using strips of paper. Was not disappointed...gave me some great new techniques to use in my layout arsenal when scrapbooking. Be advised that these techniques are not for the impatient or those who want it ""superquick"". Some are a little tedious and require some precision to look their best, but if you like scissors, paper and glue these are some fun things to try."
2,not very informative,"This book was a little repetative. Literally only howed a handful of ""tricks"" to do with the paper. Wish the description of the book would have elaborated on what it actually showed. It was very vague. Was hoping to get more ideas than just several examples of the same few techniques. Maybe if they had included less of the same tricks and I got a few more ideas than what little they covered I would have felt I got my moneys worth."
1,Don't waste your money,"I am pre-diabetic, looking for anything that might help, preliminary reports suggested cinnamon would. New reports say, no. There is also a possibility I might be having allergic reaction to the ingestion of cinnamon in quantity form. It really is now a moot point. Latest reports made me decide I had tried an unproven aid that later was proven to be of no help. I tossed them. It has a one star only because the vendor was a good vendor, shipping in a timely fashion, I probably would consider buying from them again, but NOT this product."
1,"BEWARE! They claim on their site that it's Cinnamon from Ceylon, but it is NOT","I've bought this stuff over and over again and until the last order, it was real cinnamon from Sri Lanka/Ceylon. That is lighter in color, sweet, and really wonderful. It has helped me with my blood sugar levels and I've lost over 50lbs. I bought two huge containers last week and both are the lousy Chinese, bad tasting cinnamon. Cheaper for them, but it is bad for your health to take. The cheap crap is darker, bitter, and not as fluffy. It's also doesn't smell as strong. BEWARE of this company! I am demanding a refund and will charge back my CC. This is totally wrong to put out a health product and then screw the customer and their health. I am so grateful that I noticed the color was off before I took them."
5,Help for diabetes type II,"One in the morning, one at bedtime, plus a bunch of other things are keeping my diagnosed type II at the pre-diabetes level. Fasting BGs are typically 100-105 and A1C is consistently below 6.0. In fact, my physician has recanted the original diagnosis.This product is one piece in a quilt-work of diet and life-style changes that keeps me from full blown diabetes."
5,True Ceylon Cinnamon,I started using Wonder Laboratories Cinnamon when NOW Foods changed theirs to Cassia. ( See my review there ) I just wanted those looking for Ceylon Cinnamon to consider trying this brand. The Wonder laboratories product Cinnamon Bark Capsules is Ceylon Cinnamon. I've been using it since I left my original review regarding NOW Cinnamon. Works great. Better than NOW brand in my opinion. I've read the previous Wonder Lab Cinnamon reviews. I can't speak to which cinnamon was used a few years ago but I know it smells and tastes sweeter than NOW . And is doing a great job keeping my blood sugar lower taking fewer capsules per day.
3,a decent survey,"This discusses the histories of China and Japan in 50 minutes, so you know this is just a quickie skim.You can tell what the creators found interesting. They focused on wars andd royalty. Haikus, kabuki, geisha, and cultural forms barely come up. For some reason, they mention 20-century Japanese leaders, but not Mao Tse-Dong during the Chineses segment. They speak of foot-binding in Japan, but not in China.This is a British production intended for a British audience. All of the interviewees were white Brits. There wasn't a single Asian interviewee here. The martial arts examples were done by Westerners, rather than Asians. At no point do you see anyone speaking in Chinese or Japanese and then a translater processing it in English."
5,Britney Spears Has Nothing Over On Blümchen,Usually I don't really care for live albums as they usually far short when compareds to studio albums of the same material. That isn't the case with this cd however..This cd captures the energy of the live setting while still being musically pleasing and then some. Blümchen is basically the Britney Spears of Germany except Blümchen's music is more techno orientated and thus more danceable. If you like Britney Spears then you will LOVE Blümchen.
3,Not a whole decade,"Three stars may be a bit harsh, but when the box says ""A Decade in MotoGP"" I expect 10 seasons to be covered. Sure, we're only halfway through the 2012 season right now, so I shouldn't expect to see much on this season, but this DVD didn't even show all of 2011. Other than a bit of ""false advertisement"" this really is an enjoyable DVD."
4,"Great for the golf nut, mediocre for the average man","This is an incredibly original and detailed work. Golf historians and enthusiasts will appreciate the detail, but the average sports fan might find it too tedious. But if you are a golfer, Wexner spookily evokes lost courses and estimates how the courses would play today. The book is a bit pricey; yet, that won't matter to the right customer. An excellent book within a narrow frame."
4,helpful but..,"if you are new to business process improvement this book is helpful. it gives a short but to the point descriptions of the previous concepts in this area. and also it does a good job of explaining business process modeling and design. however, the author repeats the same ideas over and over, even same figures. The whole idea could have been explained in 30-40 pages. CD and software (eval. copy) is supports the topic and the content.3.5 stars would be more precise.."
5,Dealing with the strategic business challenge of today,"focused, complete and ready to userelated titles, Anupindi et al. (1999) Managing Business Process Flows; Keen & McDonald (2000) The eProcess Edge; Dutton (1999) Society on the Line"
3,IT'S OK BUT RATHER OVERPRICED,"I am a great fan of Led Zeppelin (I have all Led Zep CDs...) and - of course - I am a great fan of Jimmy Page and his Gibson ES-1275 double neck guitar. However this action figure resembles those type of low quality products.If you put this action figure side by side to those manufactured by McFarlane Toys (any Elvis Presley, Beatles and Slash action figures - just to name a few), you will surely notice the great difference between NECA products and McFarlane Toys products. But MFT charges the same, for a much better and nicer product.I believe the idea of a Jimmy Page action figure is great and long waited but the end result could have honored properly this great rock and roll legend. Since you don't have other option, this one is just OK and that's why I gave it only three stars."
4,No Cig,"Take the cig out of Jimmy's mouth. IT LOOKS STUPID. I have nothing against smoking, do it myself.If you watch ""The Song Remains The Same"", Page is never seen smoking. I cut out the cig because my ten year old son wanted me to. It was a Christmas gift from me. Otherwise the figure is awesome."
2,Byzantine,I could not make sense of this Byzantine book and I teach this stuff. It is very poorly organized. Look elsewhere for info on this important topic.
2,Not so useful,"So instead of getting a manual on how to design a building to maximize sun, wind, and light, what I got was a lengthy math book on how to quantitatively analyze the sun, light and wind in existing conditions.... There are some nuggets of good info but I don't see myself getting very much out of the book in general."
2,Belt too big,"I ordered this for my 4-year-old for Christmas. It is made well and is very sturdy, but even on the tightest setting it is too big for my son. The age range should be changed."
2,Uh... NO.,"Let's get straight to the point. This book is the most confusing book I have ever read! The author seems to have just learned the English language and is desperatly trying to make the story sound detailed by putting in random adjectives and stuff. The main story is about a 15 year old boy named Lee, getting into trouble and things at school, and having a crush on this really mean girl named Alison. His sister is very sick, and has to go to the hostipal. Doesn't sound confusing right? Wrong! The author seemed to try and include the slang of the Brits into the story, but failed. Turning the story into a mess! ""'Go your bike, Lee?'"" and ""Coke straight out of the Ju Ju Cokebird"" were just some of the unexplanable sentaces that puzzled me in silent reading at school. Just get a good book Like the Life of Pie or Harry Potter."
4,"A very useful tool,well presented information",The book provides an opportunity to check a theatre and know something more about the location of your seats than just a stub number in an easy to use design.
4,Good for beginners!,"I purchased this book to learn how to smock dresses for my daughter. The directions are both drawn out for you to see and then written out in easy to follow step by step instructions. The written directions are very good and go into detail as to what you are doing and explaining how stitches differ from each other. The patterns included are for beginners to advanced. The patterns are all in black and white print with writing as to what color to use when. (Some books are color coded with the color thread to use being the color that the line is printed in). If you are looking for decorative patterns this book has it. If you are looking for theme patterns (bunnies, holiday, letters) this does not have that."
4,Not a bad Guitar,"I'm not very good at this game, but this is a reliable controller and it looks good. The button presses are firm and I like how popular I am with the chicks now that I've got a red guitar!"
3,The kid likes it,The kid really likes it and hasn't broken it yet. It does not have the Guitar Hero software so you will need that.
1,worthless,"This book is severely outdated. These techniques may have worked 20 or 25 years ago, but are obsolete now. The government has had plenty of time to make sure than NONE of the techniques work. Dont waste your money."
4,Second Solo Disc From Rene of Rene & Angela,"Here's one that's not seen too often, and many are unaware of its existence. It's Rene Moore's second solo release, ""Street Songz."" Many fans will remember Moore as one half of the popular '80's duo, Rene & Angela. He's credited here simply as Rene, and the program consists of all original compositions most of which are done in a Contemporary R&B or New Jack style unlike his earlier recordings with Angela Winbush. This disc wouldn't feel out of place next to one by any of today's R&B stars, and with the right promotion and a larger budget to work with, it could have been a big comeback hit. Still, if you have Rene's first solo album from 1988 or you like his work with Angela Winbush or today's R&B, you should enjoy this."
5,Great album,"This CD was available for checkout at my local library. I had never heard of the Kennedys before and I liked it with the first play. I can't believe songs from this album have not been played on the radio. Much better than the stuff we usually hear. Great harmonies, great guitar, great synthesizer, etc. I really like tracks 3, 7, 10, and 13. The sound quality is also superb. After playing it, two of my friends and my brother also bought the CD. Well done. I'm a fan."
1,The Splendor of Ethnic Jewelry,"The photographs by John Bigelow Taylor are wonderful, but this book has a paucity of explanatory text. I don't just like to look at pretty pictures. I want to know about the jewelry. Who made it? How was it made? Who wears it? How is it worn? Why was it worn? What is the human history behind it? I particularly want to know all this about ethnic jewelry. You won't get it here.No people are shown wearing the jewelry, so the book is sterile. There is no cultural context. It's a lot to pay for no additional knowledge about ethnic jewelry."
1,It doesn't work,When I got the product it didn't work. When you pushed the button for it to talk a funny sound came out and it was a gift fr someone so now I have no gift for her
4,Unsettling sadness,"Salter's short story collection ""Last Night"" left me deeply unsettled, both for its content and for the ambivalence I felt towards much of it. Undoubtedly a delicate and profound writer, his style floats precariously close to the pretentious. His elliptical use of pronouns and insistence on holding out on important information sometimes just feels too writerly and fussy. However there's no denying the power in his stories. They are all remarkably similar, almost to a fault, but each one made me feel such strong emotion at times (ususally deep sadness)that it seems important to recommend these stories, pretentions and all."
2,What Did I Miss??,"After reading others reviews on this book, I decided to buy it. WHAT DID I MISS?? Out of the 10 short stories, I enjoyed (and even understood) only 2 or 3!! No plot, No rhyme or reason. I read alot and consider myself reasonable intelligent, but did not get it. Would NOT recommend this book!"
2,Last Time,... I read this book.Could not get into it at all. Will have to try take a stab at 'A Sport and a Pasttime:
2,"quick read, good for the beach","This was a decent enough collection of short stories. I think it would be a good quick read for the beach, but overall I wasn't that impressed."
1,Terrible.,"Like a few of the other disillusioned reviewers I made the mistake of reading this turd masquerading as dark chocolate. It is true that Salter can write, that much is obvious. But after suffering through Last Night, in hope of vindicating the praise, I beleive the question is whether he should write at all. However, if you find that you can relate to or enjoy reading the stories of those who spend their time drinking fine wine, vacationing in their international summer homes, having executive affairs, and only admiring a woman for purely physical reasons, you may just love this book. File this somewhere between ""Days of Our Lives"" and ""Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous."" Watch your step."
1,Mailing it in.,"Salter had a handful of interesting and compelling thoughts for a few desultory years. Then he woke up one morning and had an epiphany: ""I don't have real book in me that could accomodate these concepts, but perhaps I could write some short stories and sell them to an audience consisting of former readers who liked my work, or new folks who didn't do their homework. A week later ""Last Night"" was finished. A pithy, boring work, interspersed with a handful of interesting and compelling thoughts. Oh, I said that already. So did Mr. Salter."
1,One of the most dangerous cosmetics on the market,"I admit I used to use this product as a teenager but this product contains some of the most dangerous chemicals sold in cosmetics. Triclosan in it is currently under review in the US and Canada. It is linked to toxic build up in the body and endocrine disruption, organ system toxicity (non-reproductive), ecotoxicology, irritation (skin, eyes, or lungs), and has contamination concerns (CHLOROFORM, DIOXINS). The last concern I mention dioxin is considered to be one of the most dangerous chemicals ever created. If you are looking for a safer shaving cream I suggest checking out websites regarding the safety of the products you are using. If you search of safe cosmetics you should find sources out there to protect you from this sort of problem."
5,best movie ever,"Maybe its because I have no friends, but ive watched this documentary dozens of times. A lot of the questions from historybowl I knew because I watched this movie.It goes into great detail in a very entertaining way. The history is fascinating and moving. The clips and music are tastfily put together. The narration is bold. Its simply a great documentary"
5,Enhancing self-control,"This is a wonderfully concise description of options one can employ when faced with unnecessary anxiety or undesired negative self-talk. The book doesn't break a lot of new ground, but does an excellent job of covering everything in a concise, almost reference like, manner. Of particular value is the chapter on dietary supplements: kava, valerian, GABA, inositol, 5-HTP, St. John's wort and others."
5,Good starting point for those seeking to escape from the pharmacy cycle.,Well put together with a useful approach to easing our societies pressures. Probably not for those who have been on this track for any period of time.
2,"Like Rush Limbaugh, just no politics","This is the original saga of the good Frist family of Tennessee, who were good people, descended from good people. They were not yet out to do good in the world. This would not happen until young Bill Frist, who was of course good, decided more money could be produced by doing good in politics than by doing good in the HMO industry.So, if you want homegrown ostentated goodness, the good old Tennessee kind, with smiling yet stern pater familias and simpering mater familias, well behaved, good children, all sitting on the porch laughing as the mockingbirds dive-bomb the non-good alley cats and human riff-raff out in the street, with godknowswhat going on in foreign countries, here's your story. Stay away from politics, where it is impossible to be GOOD, it's enough to make a good Tennessee Christian cut loose cussing."
3,Not very clear,The explanations were not that clear and the examples were not that easy to follow. The type of JTable that I was looking for was not covered at all.
5,celine dion greatest hits,Celine Dion is one of my favorite pop singers. This CD is a good collection of her greatest hits from the 80s and 90s plus a couple of new songs.
2,disappointing,it's basically a long book showing asanas. most of it is common sense stuff. the yoga sequencing book is much better.
2,Not for beginners,"I've seen this book reviewed in many reputable places as ""also"" for beginners, but it is not.Quality of presentation is also poor -- photographs border on creepy and paper is odd.Yoga for Your Life (Pierce) and Yoga of Heart (Whitwell) are my 5- and 4-star choices respectively for Vinyasa. The former has excellent sequences; the latter has refreshing philosophy."
4,Yoga - Vinyasa,"If you liked Health, Healing, and Beyond, you will love this book which delves into the practice of Yoga with Krishnamacharya. You can't go wrong here.This is a must-read."
2,useless size...,"as all W and D purses are,this one is also made very well..but..it is a completely useless size..unless it is just for show..you cannot even fit in an I phone..never mind a pack of cigs or a tiny brush."
4,Excellent yes...essential...well...,"Fabulous CD of Mardi Gras music! excellent for parties and just having a good time. Except for one small problem. It claims to be the Essential Mardi Gras CD but does not have ""If ever I cease to love"" on it, the official theme song of Mardi Gras!Whoops!But still an excellent buy!"
2,"It works, but could be more imaginative","It arrived too late for me to use on the expected occasion, but I would have been happy to use it. The choice of music could have been better and more imaginative, but it is OK, especially for background music at a party."

4,Nicely done.,"I would describe this book as a quiet joy. Some wonderful prose and postulations regarding a different way to conceive of and commune with Jesus and the light within, that is the Christ Consciousness. Mr. Selby wrote a thoroughly enjoyable easy, but not indolent, read. This book in many ways helps clear away many of the obfuscations prevalent in main stream Christianity and to some degree the bible. Not to be truculent, but I would recommend Ethan Walkers books as a more in-depth & personal approach. Four stars on the board but, I'll proffer a cogent 3 ."
3,Good for Keith fans,"I had just bought this and had it on my turntable on a sunny spring day in Baton Rouge, LA when I heard a knock at my door. When I opened it, it was the neighbor. ""Could you turn that down? It's really scary."""
5,Emerson's best work for a movie soundtrack !,"Keith Emerson is one of the very best musicians to play keyboards.Besides his work as a rock musician and the strongest part of Emerson, Lake & Palmer, he composed music for several soundtracks. And this one is his best - besides, the music is great throughout !"
3,Nothing to stand out.,"This cd recording quality is mediocre. The soundtrack is ok but I like the inferno track only, the other tracks are very similar to each other. Overall: DISCRETE."
5,Walter Lure keeps carryin' the fire for NYC guitars!,"Wow...I was expecting a decent CD, but this really blew me away! An all-too-fast set of 12 rockers...there's even a slower paced mellow NYC rocker as well (Golden Days). Walter was always the glue that held the band together when Johnny Thunders was having an off-night, in addition to being JT's equal partner both onstage and with the songwritin' pen & paper. Here he proves he can do it on his own. On ""Flight"" (a Heartbreakers mk. I song from the Richard Hell days), you would swear Johnny is singing background vocals. Andy Shernoff (The Dictators) produced this.I really enjoy this disc. Perfect for a ride into the city or out to the party with your friends.Don't chintz and get a used copy. Buy a new CD and support Walter!"
4,Spirit of Johnny Thunders lives on.,"If you've ever heard and liked Johnny Thunders from the New York Dolls, then you should check this out.Fronted by Watler Lure, ""Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers"" ex-guitarist, the Waldo's continues in the musical spirit and soul of Johnny Thunders. Its a good album, interesting, nostalgic for some.Recommended for at least nostalgia's sake."
5,Works great,"I use it every morning and my skin feels good. No itching or irritation. Used to get acne in my teen years, now in my twenties I maybe get a zit every other month. I also use almost every product from the Gillette skincare series. I love the shaving gel. Doesn't cost much compared to some other products."
2,not happy with this vacuum,Maybe we're doing something wrong but this vacuum is difficult to push on carpet and it doesn't do a good job on dog hair. Other reviews are quite positive but ours experience has been unpleasant.
5,"Sturdy, no frill vacuum cleaner","I bought the Carpet Pro for the cleaning crew at work. I wanted a solid performer that is easy to use and service. This is a very BASIC vacuum- no attachments, no lights, no automation. The cord is longer than average so you don't need an extension cord. The belt can be changed in a few minutes with a coin. There is a tiny little reset button on the lower left corner on the back. If the vacuum becomes plugged and shuts down, pull the bottom steel plate, remove the restriction and then push the reset button. It is there to save the motor from burning up. The cleaning performance is very good for a vacuum of this design. If you order one, order extra belts and bags. Riccar is the manufacturer of this vacuum in case you need to buy a belt or bags locally. Value wise, this vacuum is hard to beat."
3,Hose Came loose,"I bought the CPU-2 February 2009. It vacuums all right BUT you can't vacuum if the hose keeps falling off. The hose just ""sticks"" into the upper vacuum bag canister and stays there by a pressure fit. But it is also designed to swivel at this connection. After 9 months of swiveling the parts do not fit tightly and the hose falls out.After the above review I checked the hose connection again. The manual was no help at all. I noticed that the hose connector has a round grove around it and the canister connection has an indented circle around it. I used an extra bit of force and was able to sit the indentation into the grove. The hose doesn't come out now. I have no idea how it came out to begin with.The vacuum cleaner does a good job on carpets but not all that well on non-carpeted floors."
2,Missing part,I received the package and the box was open and one of the main screws is missing. I am not very happy.
3,Nice overall bright light but...,"The 400 watt is definitely the light to buy, even for smaller spaces, as it really lights up the space and amplifies any defects you may have in your drywall, trim, paint, etc.The light did arrive with a clunking noise when rocked side to side making me think something was broken inside the case. After taking the case apart I discovered the noise was caused by the counterweights and transformer sliding back and forth on a plastic groove. It would be better if they secured these in some fashion (silicon maybe) to avoid the customer thinking something was wrong with the light.My only other criticisms are the plastic casing is not weatherproof and maybe a little light weight. It would be nice to be able to use it outside in the rain or snow without having to worry about shorting it out. I was hoping for a heavy duty weatherproof light and this one is neither. I do think it will work great for indoor projects and am overall happy with my purchase."
1,"Faulty, missing parts","My first light arrived with no power to the socket, I returned it to the manufacturer (they paid shipping). They sent me back a damaged unit, and I complained. I was courteously provided with another unit and told to keep the damaged one for parts, but when the new unit arrived it was defective (poor assembly) and missing some minor parts. Although the 3rd unit was poorly assembled in the same manner as the 2nd, the manufacturer refused to exchange or replace it now that the 30 day period for me to seek a replacement from Amazon has passed. Although I have two lights, which both work, and a replacement bulb for the price of one light, I have yet to receive a good example of this product and my impression of Wobble Light's quality control leaves much to be desired. If you get a good one, though, it is very bright."
3,Hard to keep it in right position,"Our 3 1/2-old daughter loves the design, softness and concept, but can't quite keep it in a right position when she falls asleep... I wish there were some sort of strap that can be attached to car seat to keep it in position."
2,waste of money..so far,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter for long road trip. She liked getting a new gift but once it came time to use it she wanted her normal bed pillow instead. I hated watching her head tilt and fall but in the end she had no complaints. Maybe use will come down the road,"
4,"Effect is great, but taste quality varies widely","I can only speak to two flavors: chocolate and the double espresso. Being as I love all things mocha/coffee, I was really hoping the double espresso (the little silver packs) would work, both for taste and extra caffeine, but it was GROSS. The taste was worse than midnight coffee at a 24hrs truck stop! I choked it down, glad for the experience so that I don't ever buy that flavor again.The chocolate, on the other hand, is really not that bad. No, it's not going to taste like slurping down and ounce of delicious Hershey's fudge (since Clif Shots have that consistency) but it's not that bad either. Just wash it down with some water, which you should be doing anyway to stay plenty hydrated.Finally, buy the Clif Shots on Amazon... your local bike store will never come close the prices offered here. Be sure the check with the various Amazon sellers for best prices."
2,Not the best flavor,"Gel seems to do the trick when it comes to recharging low blood sugar, but the flavor is a little hard to take. I like the vanilla or strawberry flavors far better. You might try the Clif energy blocks to provide some variety. Some of my friends have a hard time getting the chocolate flavor down. Best to follow with a lot of water to get the taste out of your mouth."
2,Think twice about using this on your face!,"I used this product on my face once, leaving it on for four minutes, and after I washed it off my face was in a lot of pain. I don't know if it was the product or my skin, but it left me with several scars on my fair skin that I must now cover with concealer every day. So if you do decide to try this product, I recommend testing it first on a tiny part of your face that no one sees, like under your chin or something."
1,Think Twice.,"I'm a male, and I'm very self-conscious about my body, and my hair. I used this stuff to get rid of the stubble that appears mere hours after shaving. I had read that depilatories remove hair below the visible layer of skin so I tried this. I didn't get chemical burn or any rash like the dozens of other horror stories I've read, but leaving this on for the recommended 3-5 minutes (even longer) and then rinsing and wiping away did nothing to remove the hair. I tried it 3-4 more times, using a different approach each time and it didn't do a thing!If you're considering getting this think twice, and get a waxing or sugaring kit instead."
1,Don't use it....it burned my face!,I tried this on the sides of my face and it has left me with burning red skin a full day later. I have used Jolen bleach on my face and never had any problem so I figured I'll remove the hair instead of bleaching it. I will never use Nair again and I cannot recommend it to any one. Beware of Nair!!
1,horrible burned skin! Never again,After using this product to remove the small amount of blonde hair I had on my upper lip I was in terrible pain and left with scabs and breakouts. Right before thanksgiving I used this and I looked ten times work the whole thanksgiving break. It barley removed the hair and left my upper lip in burning pain and all red and blotchy for days. It's been a week and I have a huge nasty scab on my lip and I broke out a lot in this area. It's peely and dry and looks horrible even with makeup! WORST PRODUCT EVER. Nair literally burns your skin and leaves you looking worse than ever. I regret ever wasting my time or money using this crap.
1,Refuses to work,"I've used the Nair depilatory cream for legs and even that product is hit and miss. But the specific product they make for the face does even less than that. 10 minutes is the maximum recommended time to leave it on. After 15 minutes I gently dabbed it away with a warm washcloth. Behold, still facial hair underneath all of it.I wouldn't recommend leaving it on for more than that, or you'd get some nasty irritation. In fact- I wouldn't recommend this at all!"
1,Terrible waste of money,I agree with the other reviewers. Don't even bother. I followed the instructions. Says to remove at 5-10 minutes. I removed at 8 minutes after testing at 5 minutes with no results. Didn't remove my facial hair but managed to burn my skin. A terrible waste of money.
4,Not too bad.,"I have super sensitive skin, especially on my face. This surprisingly didn't bother me though. The skin felt a little weird like with a rubbery feel for a couple days afterwards, but it didn't irritate my skin at all, and it definitely got rid of the ""shadow"" above my lip."
1,Little hair removed/skin iritation,I had to use this product very often plus deal with my skin breaking out. I stopped using tjis product 5 to 6mths and and still working on clearing my irritation.
5,16 forever!,"Great introduction...even if you got a couple of albums with this group it could be great buy...it includes some rare material of extream quality.it include covers of dictators, stooges etc."
1,"If you like no taste at all, this is for you.","I ask myself what the hype is about this sauce, it comes in a cool bottle, it has a cool drawing on it, and it has the groundbreaking wooden bottle top, but what's inside. I have tried pouring a truly excessive amount of it onto my food, and I simply cannot taste the difference between food without Cholula and food with Cholula, and it's not about the heat or spiciness, I tend to be just fine with Tabasco or any other ordinary sauce. Finally I tried this on it's own, and all I can taste is vinegar. Then I thought, well, it must be organic or all great ingredients, but that's not the reason for the higher price either, there's plenty of artificial flavors and colors in here. So the hype here is really about the bottle. Sorry but you can get nice little bottles at any furniture store, as for the sauce, I'll continue to try something else."
5,my husband loves this product,"my husband likes hot and spicy foods, he really uses this a lot on various foods"
1,Worthless and Self-Serving,"This book is ostensibly a how-to manual of persuasion, but the instructional part takes up about three paragraphs and can be summed up as: networking is good.Thanks for the huge insight.The rest of the book is a series of self-glorifying stories about how rich Hanes is and how many famous people he knows. The moral of all the stories boils down to this: when you need to raise a few million for your next project just call up that newspaper editor/Cabinet member/Congressman/university president/CEO that owes you one and pull some strings. How to go about collecting these people? They're the ones you went to Yale with and sip cognac with at the Club. This is a masturbatory autobiography with no educational or instructional value whatsoever. Read Cialdini's ""Influence"" instead."
2,I guess I'm a Dissenter but this book isnt for me,I have chatted with the Author and he seems like a great guy. I went back and reread the book and it just isnt for me. He and I are from two different worlds and thats great because that is what makes the world go round. But try as I might the book and its advice didnt work for where I come from in life. Not sure those tips are applicable to most of us out here working in the world. It could be me but just didnt connect with the principles outlined in this work.
3,It's Okay...,"I was really excited to get this book because I thought it was going to walk me through the steps of creating competencies and how to put them into place. The first chapter was great. After that it sort of drags a little. Each chapter is written by a different person or group of people so it is more like an accumulation of articles rather than something that is specifically useful. The information is still good and I am looking forward to finishing the book (almost done), but it definitely has not kept my interest. There are some spelling errors in the book as well, which tend to make it seem like it is not read enough to be considered a reliable resource. It is alright, but don't have the expectation that you will have enough information to implement these systems after reading the book."
2,Disappointing overall,"Good's book is a disappointment. His explanations are often opaque; he manages to make even basic things such as type I/II errors and power seem complicated. The few examples he offers are contrived; there is an almost complete lack of real-world examples. His discussion of software is hopelessly outdated and the code he provides is confined to very simple toy problems that any serious student of his book will have no problems attacking. Items cited in the book are missing in the references, and there is also a fair number of typos. Finally, (my personal pet pief), Good doesn't seem to know the distinction between ""alternative"" and ""alternate"" - he alternates between the two without realizing that one is not an alternative for the other... I highly recommend Rosenbaum's Observational Studies instead (at least for randomization inference); it is beautifully written, rigorous, and offers many real-world examples. Good does not even cite it."
4,Kids Will Groove to This One,"Jessica Harper has delivered a series of excellent children's CDs, and Rhythm in My Shoes consistently offers an entertaining blend of clever songs. Her ability to capture parent-child banter in songs such as ""Six Licorice Sticks"" is amazing. Songs like ""It's A Crazy Machine"" or ""Boy Girl Boy Girl"" have the right mix of whimsy and reality.One of the fun things Ms. Harper does is to repeat snippets of songs from one CD in unexpected places on another (like Sting used to do with the Police) so that her body of work is in effect all a big interrelated song cycle.I like the fact that Ms. Harper's children's CDs are well recorded and that she uses talented musicians. Kids know the difference between the schlock and recycled music that predominates this market, and if given a choice they will gravitate toward fresh, engaging songs like these."
1,Terrible! Stay away!!!,"This has to be the worst TV antenna I've ever used. Big, cumbersome and does not perform.The instructions are also not explanatory at all and some of the included bolts and wing nuts don't even fit properly.The balun included with it also was of extremely poor quality.Don't waste your money on this piece of junk."
1,Phillips outdoor antenna-Don't buy it!,Philips Sdv7400K/17 20-Element Outdoor AntennaThis is quite possibly the worst product I have ever purchased. The best thing to do with the instruction manual is to burn it before you unpack the antenna and then try and put it together with your eyes blindfolded. It would be easier that way than to rely on the manual. The antenna is very cheap and I wasted several days putting this sucker up in my attic. How could anybody ethically sell this piece of ____!
3,on the fringe anyways,"I bought this ant. about a year ago I am 60 miles from duluth mn. added a radioshack pre amp-booster combo, ch. 10.1 is pretty solid 21.1 cuts in and out 6.1 is nighttime only or maybe correct cloudcover 8.1 hardly ever comes in,ant.web doesnt show me getting any of these channels anyways so maybe it doesnt matter what I try, winegard hd8200u is my next attempt."
1,Expensive Junk!,"This is the most I have paid for trash in a long time! Everyone else has covered my points. The U bolts are, indeed, too short for the mast that came in the box, and yes, a mast did come in the box! What country is this thing and the instructions built in? It is on its way back for a full refund! I should be able to bill for my assembly time too."
3,Not Good!!,"I didn't think Tales From the Crypt had a bad season, but season 6 ""SUCKS"" the stories are silly and have really stupid endings. Almost no blood and gore, I mean it ""they have more gore in two episodes of season 2 than in the whole season of 6. ""There are no really good stories here."" I don't know why people give more stars than the season is worth??"
2,Season 6...Meh,"To me, season 6 was disappointing. Too many suspense/murder tales. From here is where the show fell in my opinion. I don't think much thought really was placed in this season unlike others. It just falls flat."
3,Pretty crummy,"Tales from the Crypt seasons 1-5 were amazing. As everybody else said, it's starting to go downhill starting with Season 6, which wasn't very good at all. I'm not sure if I'll even bother buying Season 7, though honestly I probably will just for completeness.Anyway, just thought I'd post this 3-star review to help offset those 5-star posters who apparently posted before actually watching the episodes!"
5,Awesome Season,"this is a great season, tales from the crypt just gets better and better. and the crypt keeper gets funnier. the best episodes in this season areepisodes1. Let The Punishment Fit The Crime2. Only Skin Deep4. Operation Friendship8. The Assassin9. Staried In Horror11. Suprise Party12. Doctor Of Horror13. Comes The Dawn14. 99 & 44/100% Pure Horror15. You, Murdererif you have not seen this sesan then i recommend you do"
4,season six,"the tales from the crypt season six was not as good as the other five seasons, but it is a must have for tales from the crypt enthusiests. it is a shame that such a good show had to come to an end after only sevon short seasons, i wish they can make some more eppisodes."
4,Loosing the edge,The DVD quality is as always excellent.There are some excellent episodes in series 6 but as a whole in this series they seem to have missed the mixture of horror and humour which made tales from the crypt unique (its only real comparison could be with its predecessor - the Addams Family). Maybe this change occured in the original comic version which towards the end was suffering legal battles from people who found this humour/horror mixture offensive - and there by eventually destroyed this wonderful series.
3,REALLY,FIRST OFF every season has its good n bad episodes but for this season 6 it is hard to find dat really good one its like they stop trying to make it what it was really known for.Buy this set only if u have the first five if not than overlook this.
3,Not as good as the other seasons...,"this season was okay, but not as good as the other one. the episodes were kind of dull. the season finale was pretty enjoyable though."
1,How do you know what to order?,"Title says ""Late Model Porter Cable"", which means newer models.In product description section it says ""(Fits older Porter-Cable & Lamello Biscuit Jointers [spp.]). So which is it? Doesn't anyone proof read or edit the product listings? Gee wouldn't it be a good idea to list the model numbers of the joiners it fits. C'mon, Amazon how about some technical competence and professionalism in composing listings?"
4,Good for the price,"This blade appears to be decent quality and fits my Porter Cable 557 just fine. It does seem to pull the motor down more than the original blade, and will occasionally walk on the end grain of SPF lumber. Considering the substantial cost savings over genuine Porter Cable blades, this one works plenty good enough for me."
2,2 stars,"Contrary to what you're told in the product description, this CD was NOT ""Co-produced by Ty Tabor(Kings X)."" Ty was the executive producer, which is a different role from producer or co-producer. The sound quality of this CD is sub-par, and would have fared much better if Ty had been in the producer's seat. As a fan of King's X and Ty Tabor, I was duped a few years back on another site by the false description that this CD was produced by Ty, and it just wasn't very good, musically and sonically speaking. So, if you're looking at this product after a search for ""Ty Tabor"" (which is how it came up for me on this site), trust me when I say that this is NOT a must-have for Ty Tabor or King's X fans."
4,Excellent Quality,"Very happy with Pfaltzgraff, but not the size we expected. A little too small for soup, but good for cereal."
3,Low Point For Renaissance,"I am a dedicated Renaissance fan. As such I defied much of what I heard about their last two studio records (before the recent comeback) and purchased 'Camera Camera' and 'Time Line.' Camera Camera (1982) was great. I can't believe that just one year later (1983)they produced such an awfully average record. The reason seems to be the fact that John Camp took over writing the songs. Sorry John, but it just wasn't stand out work. NO Orchestra. A lot of synthesizer. Annie's voice is kept down. The longest song is usually the best on Renaissance records. The longest song here is the final cut. By the time this synthesized nonsense finished I was clutching my head and saying ""thank God that CD is finally over."" There are a few fair songs on the CD. There is nothing to make you go ""wow."" I'm glad I have all the Renaissance recordings, but this one is thier weakest work and the only one that I won't be playing over and over."
4,Punctures a lot of myths. Reading this might save your life.,"The author specializes in protecting workplaces from violent employees. In this book, in addition to discussing several case studies of violent individuals, he provides practical advice on how to predict if someone is going to ""go postal"" and how workplaces and individuals can protect themselves from harm.I found the book to be very readable and the advice he gave to be sensible and, in many cases, a real eye-opener. Moffatt dispels the myth that school/workplace shootings and domestic killings are committed ""out of the blue"" and that the murderers give no indication that they're about to blow up. This isn't really a standard true crime book, but true crime buffs will certainly enjoy it."
4,Helpful despite a few vague details,Figured with the fewer years the guide would be more likely to meet the needs of the car. Details were slightly vague but it was helpful for the tasks I've used it for so far.
4,Everything is detailed for the accord model but...,"I don't know much about cars, so sometimes it was a bit difficult to understand, especially when automotive words were used. It does help me understand a bit more about what goes into fixing a car."
5,Phillips DVD PET,The DVD player by Phillips is absolutely wonderful. It picture is clear and the 10.2 screen is great for watching any kind of movie. You couldn't ask for a better system. I am thrilled with my purchase!
3,Sound isn't worth the price,"I was looking for a DVD player that my kids could use in the back seat of a car. Unfortunately, the volume is so poor, the kids could not hear the movie from 2 feet away.Other than the sound, the player works great. If you are looking for a DVD player to use with headphones or in a perfectly quiet room, this is the player for you. If you are looking for an in-car DVD player without headphones, look for another player.The player does setup easily but if you need a manual, this one is the worst I have seen."
1,Doesn't last long,This player didn't even make it a year before breaking down. Bought it in April & it no longer displays a picture & it's only November. The player was handled with care & no abuse. Bought other cheaper models that at least lasted a full year before problems began. Don't waste your money on this piece of .........
3,Great -- except for the battery design,"Great picture and audio. Excellent battery life. BUT the way the battery attaches to the player is TERRIBLE. The player cannot sit flat with the battery attached. The battery pack seems like it will fall off if the player is not carefully handled.Also, this is not the player to casually slip into your hand luggage for a flight. It is heavy.Finally, if it's important to have a large screen, good image quality and sound, why not spring for a small laptop computer. Great for travel, and it gives you a world more flexibility than any portable DVD player. (Of course, it costs significantly more.)"
4,Excellent value,"The nay sayers make much of the loudness: speakers, not enough; machine noise, too much. It's a PORTABLE device intended to be used with headhones!! With them, sound is excellent; the machine noise insignificant. With it's crystal clear big screen size and long battery life it's the best of it's class."
3,Both great and poor,"Gorgeous screen and image. Great battery life. Looks good and works fine.On the downside, the spindle motor is noisy, really noisy, to the point it distracted me while watching movies. Also, the sound volume won't go up enough in general, and not at all high enough to drown out the spindle motor.So my advice would be buy this if you plug it into external sound systems or head phones and don't use it much sitting on your lap. I returned mine."
2,POOR PERFORMANCE,"I AM SORRY THAT I BOUGHT THIS PLAYER.ALTHOUR I WAS READING IN ANOTHER REVIES ABOUT NOISY MECHANISM,I DID NOT EXPECT IT TO BE SO NOISY AND DISTURBING IN A QUIET ROOM.MAY BE IN THE CAR IT IS NOT NOTICEABLE.ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT IT PRACTICALLY CAN'T PLAY DVD+, SKIPS AND STALLS ALL THE TIME ON ANY DVD+.QUALITY OD PICTURE AND SOUND ARE GOOD.WITH A NEW MODEL 1060 I HOPE THAT THEY CORRECTED THESE DEFICIENCIES.THIS IS A GOOD PLAYER FOR KIDS."
1,NO VOLUME AT ALL,"This DVD player has a great screen, but that is all! When you are watching a movie you want sound also, and the volume in this DVD player is completely useless. Incredible, how a brand as Philips can deliver this kind of lame quality."
2,poor instructions,Difficult to use with poor performance. Instruction booklet difficult to follow. Requires use of remote control to effectively use.
3,one of the first cd's,"GirlFight is typical of the early work that S.C.O.T.S. produces. The short cd contains many songs that are not on anyother cd. The title track ""Girlfight"" is typical S.C.O.T.S song in the same type as ""Walk like a Camel"", Bananna Puddin'"" and ""Daddy was a Preacher and Momma Was a GO-Go Girl"". If you are a S.C.O.T.S. fan you will like this cd. If you are not a fan, this may change your mind."
5,Got Me to the Router!,"Although some other products used on my wireless desktop gave me 1 bar (out of 5) for connection quality, 2 on a good day, this product has continuously given me 4 solid bars since I installed it. And, it's just sitting on the desk out of the way, not hanging on the wall at some advantageous position. I am VERY happy. FYI: I am using WPA 2."
5,"Easy install, works well",I use it on my desktop computer located upstairs to access my wireless hub located downstairs. It gets a strong signal and provides a good connection.
4,LINKSYS wireless rangebooster,I have a garage about 180 feet from my home that I converted into a office . this works with that distance and gives me three bars of signnal most of the time .
2,Did nothing more than my laptop,I bought this in hopes that I would get a little more range when using my laptop at school. It does nothing more than the internal receiver in my laptop.
5,The Best - Hands Down,"The only label I've used that completely blocks out the CD Manufacturer's logo and doesn't curl when you peel it off the sheet. I've used Memorex, Neato and Avery - none compare to the quality of the Stick It Right by Great Gizmos, inc. My only complaint is that they are becoming scarce. I used to be able to find them at Best Buy and now they're gone. - stockpile if you get the chance."
2,cunning or canny?,"The book is not very original in content, compiling material from a variety of Wiccan, folklore and Chaos Magic sources - but it is enthusiastic and sometimes engaging. The most cunning thing about the author Nathaniel Harris is his description of himself as a 'hereditary witch'; in fact his mother and stepfather are Alexandrian Wiccans, which is not quite so exciting."
1,Fluffy Darkness,"This book is seriously a waste of time and money! You could learn more watching Puff The Magic Dragon Cartoon than reading this. This is more like dark Wicca(the modern version) not the old Wicca(pronounced, not spelled Witcha) Besides the fact that theres a big differnce between ""Witcha"" or more correctly Wicca(elder witchcraft) and the cunning arts, he dosn't teach you anything you coudnt learn from modern Wicca. It is truly a shame one can not find a real book published on the Tru Vanic arts."
2,Goblin: Not as good as LOTR soundtracks..,"I'm not one for symphonic metal, but this sounds a lot like Apocalyptica. It's very haunting and suiting for the movie, as it was for Suspiria, but not as good in composition overall.If you want to listen to good spooky music, watch Nekromantic or get Mark Ryden's Blood soundtrack."
4,At last!,"Gee, after a long long wait the Zombi-Dawn of the Dead soundtrack is released. It was well worth the wait. The electronic tracks are especially worth listening to (don't do it in the dark, you'll be scared). Of course, those who didn't see or like the movie won't have the same feelings as those who did. Note that the european and U.S. versions of the movie being very different, so is the soundtrack: this one is the european one. Still this is THE definitive soundtrack of Romero's masterpiece."
3,My Opinion About This 20th Anniversery Reissue,"The problem with this C.D. is that only about 1/4 of the songs featured on it are in the American version of the movie. That is a real bummer for some American fans I would imagine. It is as if Goblin were the only ones to compose music for the film. I hope somebody makes another reissue with the American version's mall music, jazzy restuarant music, orchestral music, and Claudio Argento's composition(s). I especially like the rock type song with English language singing and played during the Jonestown scene. Combine those songs with the ones on this 20th anniversary reissue and you have the real complete original motion picture soundtrack to this movie. Until then, this is the best you can get. I would still recommend buying it because it may be the best release you will ever be able to get."
4,The best yet...,"...but diehard fans of this film want more. There is still a bit of missing music from Dawn, including the DeWolfe library tracks. The music used when Roger and Peter open the sliding Penney's door--that is nowhere to be found on any release. Nor is the exact track used in the beginning, complete with the human wailing Moog noises. A couple of tracks used when the gang is shopping in the supermarket, etc., I was hoping to hear. I'm not 100% if some of the music I'm thinking of is Goblin or not, but there is certainly a little market of Dawn addicts who would love a bigger, more complete release of music. As it is though, this disc is simply a must for fans, if only for Track 14 (""Power must not be off in this area..."")"
2,"Total cheese-good kitsch, bad music-""Suspiria"" much better.","I heard some Goblin years ago and bought this cd due to the number of people on the net claiming it to be their best album. What a disappointment! Anyone who grew up in the eighties will hate the ""dugadugaduga"" Night Rider Casio keyboard queso on the ""action"" tracks, while the more ""suspenseful"" songs suffer from Soundtrack Bombast Syndrome. I understand that many people enjoy the kitschiness of this album, but as someone from the younger end of what is generally considered ""Generation X"", I wasted enough time laughing at garbage during the '90s to endure any more ""art"" that I don't really like for the sake of a smirk. I was almost ready to write Goblin off, until I heard ""Suspiria"", which is much more multilayered, rhythmic, and genuinely eerie at points. It has the wackiness of ""Zombi"", while avoiding the flat ""Saved By the Bell"" incidental dance music quality."
2,"Good, but could have been better","I too was happy to see this soundtrack finally released, but was disappointed in the end. Not only are certain tracks too repetitive, but the one song I was looking forward to, the ""haunting"" mall theme, was missing. Considering the wait, it could have been better."
2,"Good, but should have been better","While I was happy that this soundtrack was finally released, I was disappointed with the omission of the mall theme song.The tracks are good, but repetitive. Considering how long we had to wait, this should have been better. How about releasing the soundtrack to Wolfen??"
1,Not Good Enough,"In response to another reviewer, Goblin did not perform the ""bonus"" Zombie sounds either, yet they were included on the disc. The Mall Theme made more of an impact (as the various disappointed reviewers are attesting to) than the Zombie sounds.I read the reviews so I went in with my eyes open, I was disappointed in the end. There are great tracks here, but too many useless ones as well. The Mall theme would have been the icing on the cake."
2,Not so good.,"These guys really suck. Nearly three fourths of this cd is boring repetitive music(especially track 14). Tracks 1, 2(gets real annoying), 6, 7, and 11 are only worth listening too. Romero only chose those (except 6) to be in his film and I agree the rest should be kept out."
1,You call this a soundtrack??,"I felt compelled to write a review of this CD finally, even though I bought it five years ago! ( I saw the new Dawn of the Dead movie tonight, which reminded me about the soundtrack.)This is simply a Goblin album, NOT a soundtrack of Dawn of the Dead, even though that's what they call it. Only a few of the numerous tracks here are even in the movie- I don't know where the rest of the songs come from, but I can tell you they're pretty awful. And to think I paid twenty bucks for this when it first came out!! Don't buy this CD!!"
3,Complete Incomplete Soundtrack.,This CD is great. But also check out the Previously Unreleased Incidental Music CD at amazon.com/uk.
5,this site sucks,"amazon is the worst retailor to buy any goblin or dawn of the dead music from. they repeatedly told me that the zombi soundtrack was in stock. when i tried to order it they told me they were out of stock yet their site said it was in stock for 6 months after that!I had to order from tower.com (who are awesome!) Amazon is not a great site to order from and I am dissapointed with them.This cd is so worth it, so don't be discouraged by this site..... serch around if you buy it."
5,Nice piece of furniture,"This is a well made piece of furniture. It required assembly, but everything fit and the hardware was good quality. I would highly recomment it."
3,Looks good,This stool looks really good but is not the sturdiest stool. It got very wobbly so I ended up using it as a decor table and put a lamp on it. Looks really good. Just not sturdy enough to sit on.
2,Nice toe ring. Fits well,"I really enjoy my toe rings. I think this one fits well and is comfortable to wear with or without shoes. it is cute and fun to wear. UPDATE four weeks after first putting it on, it broke in two pieces. alas, you get what you pay for."
1,Poorly packaged missing pieces = Disappointed 5 yr old.,Bike arrived in a beat up box. When I went to put it together I found there were no peddles for it in the box. Also one of the pads for the front caliper brakes was missing. The graphics are cheap stickers and are poorly applied. I called Huffy Customer service and they said they would ship me the missing parts. I found out they're warehouse is in Carson CA just 5 miles from my house and asked if I could just go get the parts myself but they told me that security would not let me on the property. I then asked if I could just go to one of they're 700 service sites and pick up the missing parts there but was told if I did I would have to buy them. Now my 5 yr old son is upset because he can't ride his new bike because it has no peddles. I almost forgot the front wheel also has bent spokes and has a pretty good wobble to it. I would return the the bike and buy a different brand if it didn't mean my son would have to go even longer without a bike.
4,Nice Bike,"The bike was very nice, my grandson just loves it. I would have given it 5 stars except for the way it arrived. The front tire rim was bent and by the time we took it out of the box on christmas eve and put it together it was to late to return for one that was not bent. So we ended up spending money on it after christmas replacing the rim."
4,Nice Bike,"Awesome bike with a whole lot of power and kid appeal. Was given by me to my Nephew who loved it. Rode it till he was to big for it and then kept ridding it. What I really liked was it was a nice ""cool"" Bike with awesome color and could still be used with training wheels and adjusted for a growing child."
1,Kinda Ironic Isn't It,"It is kind of ironic that Amazon lists this book. Obviously they have not read it. Since 2000 they have outsourced almost all of their customer service. And not exactly done a bang up job of it.Notice that there are no contact phone numbers even listed on the site anymore? You have to have them call you. I had a problem with my last order (and I do mean my last order ever with Amazon) today. While unfailingly polite, the customer service rep took 5 minutes to locate my order ( the computer kept giving him the wrong one) and could not resolve my problem. At least I think that's what happened. I could hardly understand a word he said.What has happened to this one proud company? What has happened to this one proud nation?"
2,Beyond Pillaging,"This work starts with a description of the Vikings pillaging a British town. However, the work eventually looks at other phenomenon such as Viking women, jewelry, and religion. It's easy to assume that once Ancient Rome went Christian, then so did all of Europe. However, here were a group of people that still practiced ""pagan"" religions during the Middle Ages. The work also shows that Viking travels were far-reaching. This mentions that they came to North America, but they reached Constantinople as well.The narrator is an American woman who good sound recording backing her up. The videotaped interviewees were all British men with bad recording. Their accents aren't thick, but because of the bad equipment, some viewers may not be able to hear them.Though many sources say the Vikings did not have horns or other ornamentation on their helmets, this work showed horns, wings, and all kinds of stuff without ever saying it's historically inaccurate."
4,works for me,Tribuplex has helped me have a little more edge when i workout. It is a great deal at 50% less than buying locally.
2,Not terribly effective,"Doesn't do much. Only a little bit at first; then stopped having any effect. Expected a lot more. Doesn't quite deliver, if you ask me."
3,works alright,"This was the first supplement I took for testosterone enhancement product I tried and I really didn't know what to expect. It was okay, I did feel some effects but I think that this supplement needs to be taken with other in order to feel the full effects."
1,No nothing!,"After 2 bottles I feel no different.no extra pump,no extra nothing! Won't buy again.better off using a good creatine,stacked with bcaa's"
2,Boooooo!,This product has no effect on me whatsoever. I can't believe this product received so much positive reviews. Don't waste a single dime on this product.
1,Don't get,"I don't know what these will do to you, but don't get them. They taste nasty, almost enough to make one gag."
3,Works ok,"This stuff works great for libido and somewhat so for energy. I bought it looking for a libido enhancer and was hoping for the energy too. Its great to wake up with ""wood"" like I did when I was younger and have the drive back for my wife. I talked to my Doc and he says all the studies discount that tribulus boosts testosterone, but he says it does seem to boost libido since libido depends on more than just testosterone. So it must work by a different avenue than testosterone. He said it was safe enough to take though. I'm not sure I would buy it if I was looking for a boost at the gym, but definitely for my purpose! Edit: I Recommend Horny Goat Weed Complex by Swanson over this product for libido. Works way better."
2,NO noticeable effects,"I had high hopes when taking this product, I am a active male who works out 3 times a week. I have not noticed any differences in my body at all. After a couple weeks of trying this product i have now discontinued being as there is no point. I am only giving 2 stars because I know different supplements react differently to different peoples body's so maybe it was just that my body did not need what it offered. I would NOT reccomend this product to anybody I would tell them to save their money or research a little better and find a better product."
1,didn't like it,I took this for a couple of weeks and I believe it made me feel grumpy and less sexual. Maybe something else was going on but that's how it seemed. I have since discontinued using it and gradually got back to what is normal for me.
1,First Time Trying,I really wasnt impressed with this product. Every couple of months I try a new supplementfor testosterone and pre work out to find the one that works the best for me. By for thisone has worked the least for me.
4,Strength Increase,Product is great as a pre-workout. I usually take 3-4 before the gym and 1-2 prior to sleep. Notice 10-15 lb increase in backrow and bench exercises. 15-20 lb increase in squatting. I recommend taking the 1 gram of protein per lb of weight rule to see noticeable gains. Ordering my second bottle soon.
2,Proprietary Blend,"A supplement that lists a ""proprietary blend"" on the bottle can be there for one of two reasons:(a) to prevent the competition from knowing exactly what ratios and amounts of each ingredient present in the formula to prevent the competition from copying their formula exactly (commonly referred to as a `knock off') or(b) to hide the fact the formula contains very little of the active ingredients listed on the bottle in an attempt to fool consumers.Sadly, the latter use is far more common then the former. They see a long list of seemingly impressive ingredients listed in the ""proprietary blend"" none of which are there is amounts that will have any effects. This is commonly referred to as ""label decoration"" by industry insiders. The former use of the term is a legitimate way for a company of a quality formula from having the competition copy or ""knock off"" their formula and the latter use of the term is to scam people."
2,No Noticable Effects,"I didn't notice any changes from using this product, but that's just me personally. I'll try other products in the future, but this was basically a waste of money for me."
2,Didn't work for me,"It's not a T booster. It specifies it ""helps MAINTAIN healthy testosterone levels"", not boost them. I tried this in place of GNC's High T because of the cost, and it was a waste of money."
2,Okay but not Great,Works but not as well as my regular product purchased locally. Ordered online only because local store was out and wouldn't have any for weeks. Might work better for someone else.
2,Not sure about this one,"For the reason I had decided to try this product, it did not provide me the results that I hoped. I do have more energy lately, but that could be due to the fenugreek that I have been taking in addition to this product."
1,Doesn't work,Doesn't do anything. Went through the whole bottle and nothing. I would not reccoment this product to anyone because it doesn't work
3,I guess,Positive there are no side affects but just not the pump i was looking for but it might wrok for you
1,More snake oil in a bottle!,"I Can't even tell I've taken anything. Might as well have bought tic-tacs. I'm sure I'd have gotten the same outcome, with the added bonus of a candy taste."
3,Hard To Rate,"I think most any doctor will tell you that different drugs will affect each person a little differently. I found that after about a week taking this stuff as directed, I started feeling edgy and over-sensative which led to a number of irritating skirmishes with my wife for no good reason. This behavior was totally uncharacteristic. I discontinued use and returned to normal within a few days. About a month later I tried it again but this time I only took one capsule a day rather than two. After a week I began having irritability problems again. I discontinued use for good. In spite of that bad feature, it did increase energy and drive. I was able to get much more work accomplished. For someone considering buying this product, may I suggest you start with a single bottle and remember what I told you here."
2,MRM Tribuplex 750 mg,"I don't take many test boosting products and this one was what I expected it did not work.The delivery was on time and packaging was perfect. However, the product did not do anything for me.I will not waste my money on this product again."
3,No Oxtail Recipe!!!!!,"Maybe some of us have different editions of this book. I got my book a couple of days ago and today I really started looking at the recipes, I read the comments and I have no oxtail recipe!! The index says oxtail page 49, my book has that page that says for ""To Market, To Market"". For the commentator that said oxtail recipe on page 82, my book has pages 82 and 83 with pictures of food! I love the book but my goodness, where is this mysteries recipe???!!! Everything else is there though.....Ah well!! Not happy:("
5,The real taste of Jamaica,"One of the easiest cook book to follow, with great and genuine Jamaican cuisines.A book that a non cook can follow and cook a delicious meal as that of a professional.Has real and different Jamaican cusines. Things that I have not eaten in years.Great book to give as gift to foreigners who love Jamaican cuisines.A must have recipe book in every home."
5,Great book,I am a born and bred jamaican and this book has all the great recipes. I like the pictures and how its broken down into different sections. Great buy for a jamaican who is looking for variety or someone learning how to prepare jamaican meals.
5,This book is the real deal,Mekisha Hugh Hampton apparently cannot read - this book DOES an oxtail recipe. There are also a few 'paid for' reviews on here as well (just look at reviews for other cookbooks and you will see what I mean). I am a West Indian and I appreciate all island cooking - this book is a wonderful addition to your cookbook library. So please disregard Mekisha Hugh Hampton's review
4,Authentic,I am Jamaican and I often refer to this cook book for recipies I'm not familiar with. I find the recipes to be authentic and delicious.
4,Gets the job done..,I ordered this book so i could prepare some meals for my BF who is Jamaican. There are recipes in here that i have prepared for him that he's never had and he loves them. He sometimes go home and call me to ask how to prepare them. The downside is some of the ingredients are hard to find unless you live somewhere like New York where generally it's easier to find some of the items. Other than that i either leave it out or try to substitute. I wish the book had more pics though.
3,Decent recipes,"Would have loved more information about prep for some of the foods, including ackee (how to choose, clean, etc.). Otherwise, the recipes were great."
4,Great food!!!,"I have made two dishes from this cook book so far, the curry lobster and Beef patties. They were absolutely delicious!!!! This cook book is a Great buy!!"
2,Be wary of size!,"I have a blue Nike watch, and really like it. Ordered this one to wear every day; however, it is really a child's watch. It is for wrists of approx. 5 inches. Unless you are tre petite, this won't fit."
1,disapointment,"I ordered this fun watch for a friend. The digital numerals didnt show up correctly, she tried to return for exchange, big hassle so when I tried to exchange it was no longer available despite several sites saying that it was. Another watch from Nike ordered at the same time stopped working after 1 month--returned that one. Attractive, fun product with poor reliability."
2,Safe Sanding,These sanding pads work ok for VERY light sanding.Don't expect to change a lot of surface with these.
5,So far so good...,The book is a great read into the southern Italian underground. I spent three years in Naples and this has been an eyeopening look into the lives of a select few people whom I lived among. I knew the Hollywood version of the Mafia and some quiet word of mouth stories about folks in Naples. I wish I had this book when I lived there! Southern Italy is a wonderful place to visit but this lets you see into the lives of the small number of goons and thugs that rule the alleyways. What is interesting is how similar their problems in Southern Italy are to people here in the USA.
5,You'll find yourself singing along!,"It's funny, but a lot of the songs on this album were new to me (crawling in the dark, to name one), and as I heard them done by the original artists, I found myself saying, ""That's a BOCA song!"" My favorites include The Way it Is, Everywhere, and Working for the Weekend. I also recommend 2001 (Owner of a lonely heart by the ISU Shaggy Boys and others)."
4,Frank Capra's Darkest Film Might Be his Best,"Predating ""Elmer Gantry"" (the film) by twenty years is this overlooked gem starring Barbara Stanwyck as a vindictive daughter of a minister. She begins the film with an intense diatribe against religious hypocrisy, but she eventually succumbs to the very corruption she originally railed against.When she meets a charming blind man her eyes have finally opened up to her sins and ""sees the light"".There's a scene that recalls the old ""Golden Calf"" episode from the Bible involving a party full of drunken carny people revelling at Sister Fallon's home.Stanwyck's acting in this film is a real eye-opener. She alternates between powerful virtue and an understated sexuality that's subtle and very well done. David Manners' performance was so convincing. He did an unbelieveable job portraying a handicapped man.TCM shows this film from time to time, but I'd like to see a DVD release so everyone can see what a great film this is."
4,"minor Capra/Stanwyck title, ripe for rediscovery","Barbara Stanwyck shines as the young daughter of a deceased minister who decides to take up where he left off, only to be sidetracked into heading a corrupt religious sect. Frank Capra's THE MIRACLE WOMAN was a thinly-veiled attack on Aimee Semple MacPherson, the well-known controversial figure of the 1930s whose evangelical rants are eerily echoed in Stanwyck's fever-pitched performance.While it's now sadly regarded as one of his minor works, THE MIRACLE WOMAN (1931) gave Capra the chance to explore the strange, frenzied world of religious celebrity. Stanwyck shines and mesmerizes as Sister ""Faith"" Fallon, a woman seduced by the desire to become an evangelical leader, but redeemed by the unconditional love of a blind man (David Manners). Sam Hardy and Beryl Mercer co-star. Recommended."
2,It falls apart,"After one wear and a wash, it started to fall apart where the thread was. If u are not a sewer u might not want this. I will be sewing it back together soon. Walk I was glad to get this size for my son who wears 2t but got it in a 3t which help with having clothes under it with the cold weather we had."
5,Just like old times,"This coin purse works perfectly. It is just the right size, and the flexibility of the rubber is perfect. I've had some coin purses that were too small that you could hardly get your fingers in to get the proper coins. I bought two in case I lost one and good thing I did because I lost one and am on my second one. Amazing how things get missing when you have 4 kids in the house.This is the best way to keep up with your change."
5,No more change hoarding!,NO more change hoarding!I can't even deposit change in banks in which I have accounts without paying a penalty for depositing change. That is crazy. I decided to declare a war on excessive change. I remember as a kid seeing these little change purses people would use. Men liked them because they didn't make holes in your pockets. This work great. Last week my change was down to .11cents. I love it. No more costing me money to deposit change. No change left to deposit!
2,Wish I could rate them!!,"It has been 14 days, have not received them. So rating not so much. Link said items was ready to go on the 1st. I know I'll love them when I get them."
2,bummed,Arrived quite fast for something shipped to hawaii! My daughter loved it my only complain is after a week the back of it split open my daughter was devastated
5,Ahhhh yesteryear,I had been looking for one of these everywhere. So glad to have found one on amazon. I use this product to hold my coins for tolls and parking meters in my car. I don't like to keep coin loose in the car it will rattle and drive me crazy.
4,As expected,"This is the kind of coin holder that my husband likes to carry. Glad I found it for him. It was a little sticky, but I think that's the way most of them are."
5,Yay! At least I can buy these somewhere!,"My husband swears by these, but in recent years we haven't been able to find them in stores. What a relief to finally replace his old one. This one is everything it should be."
2,Goodman's was slow and inefficient. The product?? Time will tell...,"Goodman's was slow and inefficient. The product?? Time will tell...No order should take from August 29 until shipping on 9/15 when full shipping charges are assessed. And emails to the company with inquiry as to status after 10 days of no information on shipping status, should not be ignored."
2,Shipping costs more than the battery,"After reading the reviews, I was all set on purchasing this item - how could you go wrong for $6.19? Well, during checkout, standard shipping was $7.85 bringing the total to $14.04. I could walk down to my local store and get it for $10 myself. I guess I'm going to have to. Convenience isn't that expensive."
5,Works great with Uniden also,Compatible with my Uniden Cordless also. Has been working well for over a month.
4,Beware of imitations,When the battery in my panasonic cordless phone went flat and would no lonegr hold charge I bough an aftermarket replacement. After 3 months the replacement was as bad as the battery I replaced. So far the Panasonic replcement has worked fine.
4,"when its good its good, but...","We followed the initial charge instructions, but despite this the original battery (same model) that came with our phone would never hold a charge for more than 15 minutes. Total nightmare. We decided to try replacing the battery instead of buying a new phone (much cheaper route) just to see if it was a faulty battery and it has paid off. The new battery stays charged just fine and saved us the cost of replacing the entire phone. So, as long as its not faulty, this battery works like a charm."
3,You get what you payfor!,"I bought this lock for my tool trailer. I used to for less then a year when the key started jamming in the lock. I removed the cylinder from main body of the lock to examine and lubricate it. I lubricated it with white lithium grease and work the key in and out to work the grease into pins. That is when 2 of the pins popped loose and made the lock useless. I could buy an new cylinder, but I have decided to upgrade to an Amereican Lock that is ""Bump Proof"".What I was displease with was the length of time the lock lasted. I did not even get a full year of use. I could have received a faulty unit and only need to get a warranty replacement. There was just something that made me feel that the lock was inexpensive. I can not give a qualitative description, it just felt cheap. The only thing can think of is that there might have been much play in the lock cylinder.I would say this would be a good lock for light duty applications. A daily use was a bit much for it."
2,"Just because a book is about lesbians, doesn't make it good.","This had Michelle Tea levels of self-service, without Tea's colorful, honest, relatable storytelling. Nothing is described in detail, little emotion is actually captured.I didn't feel like I knew the narrator, I didn't care about the story. One location moved clumsily to the next amidst bad poetry and lame and needy letters to an ex.In short, this book was crap, like most lesbian lit, unfortunately."
2,"Weak construction, poor A-T service","When we adjust the headset forhead size, the slider pulls apart.This allows the right ear clip to be easilylost, which is what happened.A-T charges over US$100 for the rightear clip 'service' !And you can't just order the parts,you must return the entire mic.In our case we use it in Mexico,so shipping and safe return is nearly impossible.Knowing this, they still would notjust sell us the parts.Audio Technica is not very accommodating,nor helpful."
4,"""memories of your own childhood"" - ""Pure Americana""!","William Ross and Varese Sarabande present a warm and touching score produced by Robert Townson - ""My Dog Skip"", about a boy and his dog during the period of World War 2 and the different turn of events that effect them both. The music works well for this nostalgic film set in Mississppi, each cue tugs at your heartstrings with sentimentally. This soundtrack is ""Pure Americana"", very traditional and wonderful in listening respect. The orchestration is magical that stir up forgotten memories of days gone by.Highly recommend this album - shades of ""Forrest Gump"" (1994) by Alan Silvestri, which isn't bad company to keep. So film and score collectors enjoy and remember your own childhood with ' ""My Dog Skip""!Total Time: 37:29 on 14 Tracks/Varese Sarabande - 302 066 106 2 (2000)"
5,Delightful,"Simply a delight to listen to. The sountrack like the movie has the same innocence of Forrest Gump. The music was perfect for the movie and can stand alone as a musical work. If you haven't seen the movie, see it. If you have seen the movie, you will purchase this CD."
5,Excellent!!!,"I can't say enough good things about this score. Right from the start you will notice a similair style to Forrest Gump, but considering Ross was the orchestrator on Gump, it's no wonder that this score has the same admirable qualities. Rarely do you get a film score that has this much heart. You can hear it and just sense it from the performance of the orchestra. I am a big collector of film music and I always find myself coming back to this CD for times in life when you need some simple and beautiful reflective music. William Ross has composed a gem here and I highly recommend it. One listen and you will be hooked (or leashed I should say...)"
1,it arrived broken and no one returned me for almost 2 years!!,"I ordered this audio cd on 22th of March 2010, it arrived broken and i didnt find anywhere to write this problem, i cannot l,sten this audio cd and it is very annoying not to listen it. Now i find a place to write my comment and give the 1 star because no one returned me back for this problem, i paid for something useless !!"
5,Corteo is one of the best,"OK, I admit it, I love Cirque. I've seen this one twice, and the music ranks among the best."
3,Corteo,"All Cirque music is interesting - right off the bat I have to admit to being a groupie and having seen most of their shows (not Corteo tho). And sometimes the music stands better or worse than it does in the context of the show. Corteo has flashes of brilliance and worth the purchase for that reason. But overall I rate it as only pretty good. Not on the level of the music to O and Ka and Allegria, the Film (the latter in the category of the music reaching heights beyond the show itself. The main track is the one that lives with you."
3,"This book could be considered ""Stick and Rudder - Lite""","This book is good for a quick review or for a very cursory overview of taildraggers. For the price it is worth having, but it is nowhere as complete as ""Stick and Rudder"". That said, it provides a nice quick explanation of the procedures for operating a tailwheel aircraft. There is a section with specifications for a number of classic taildraggers that is handy to use if you are shopping for a taildragger and haven't yet decided which model you like.If you want to become a taildragger pilot buy and read ""Stick and Rudder"". Get this book for a handy quick reference. For under $ 10 you can't go wrong."
5,Mark Wills does it again!,"Never mind that two of the songs on the CD aren't his--he does them well. In fact, BACK AT ONE is the reason I bought the CD. But I discovered some other great songs hidden in there--EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT YOU, RIGHT HERE, THE PERFECT CONVERSATION, and the perfect fatherhood song, IN MY ARMS. I really can't believe that anyone would put a bad review on this page--can't they see that Mr. Wills is one of the most talented singers in this generation? He's all country, with maybe a slight pop side. But who cares? This is a great album, and if you buy it, it'll be in your collection PERMANENTLY."
2,Find some original songs!,"I am a huge music fan, and I am also a musician myself. Mark Wills has amazing talent and excellent skills...however, every song that he chooses to release is not his song. It seems like every Mark Wills song on the radio has been done by some huge Pop star. It is rather annoying. I'm not against covering songs, but I do feel that Mark's true talent might come out with an original song by him. Enough of Brandy...and Brian McKnight...they have made the songs popular. I will say that he is an excellent musician, but just seems to release the poor songs."
4,Makes you think...,"I'm a country fan, especially the old stuff. However, country music has always rooted itself in deep,heartfelt emotional songs. Many people try to put emotion into their music, but most fail. Mark Wills does what many other ""new"" country singers cannot do, and that's put feeling in each and every song. This album makes you appreciate the one's you love, or the one's you've lost. Now, if that's not country, I don't know what is Happy listening."
5,I was very impressed by this album. I loved it.,"I thought this was a very good effort by Mark Wills. I am tired of hearing people say ""not country."" What is country anymore? In a genre where Shania Twain and Garth Brooks are considered ""country,"" this is a much more legitimate effort than those of the previously mentioned artists. It sounds like he had fun making this album. I like all the songs on this album, but my personal favorites are ""This Can't Be Love,"" ""Rich Man,"" ""Right Here,"" ""Almost Doesn't Count,"" ""Forget About Love,"" ""In My Arms,"" and ""Back At One."" I thought he especially did a good job on ""Back At One"" by singing the song in his own style and he also sings it very well. This may not be his most country record, but by modern country music standards, it is pretty good."
4,Unfortunately not complete,"Finally, there is the re-issue of this soundtrack - as usual (for a cinevox record) with bonus tracks, this time 11 in a row, all of them alternate/film versions of previously released material, some of them grouped as suites. Unfortunately, it is not a complete recording. Both the Simon Boswell tracks and all of the Heavy Metal Songs are missing - but this was to be expected for the latter at least, due to copyright problems.It is a very eerie, very atmospheric soundtrack - but it works best with the pictures of the film to go along. As a record, it tends to repeat itself after a while, so it's not a CD ""just to listen to"". This is not supposed to imply the music was not good - quite the contrary. But it loses a lot of its potency without the pictures.For soundtrack collectors, this is an indespensible record - there are far too many classic cues on it to miss it."
3,A complete version would be nice.,"This is a great score by Goblin but, with only five different tracks this CD does run the risk of wearing on one's nerves. It would have been nice to have a complete score with the tracks by Bill Wyman/Terry Taylor, Simon Boswell, Iron Maiden, etc. included(sort of how Cinevox did with their re-release of Profondo Rosso which featured both the Goblin and Giorgio Gaslini tracks). That said, this CD is definitely worth purchasing for fans of both Goblin and Euro Horror in general. But, then again, what do I know? You may be better off listening to those who just keep it ""real."""
2,Desire??,"Am I missing something? What happened to the 'Desire' song? I see it on the insert provided, but not in the song listing. I would really like this for my 80's collection, but I feel this CD is incomplete. And could somebody put Dance Electric on the CD, too?"
4,Great Soundtrack for a Great Movie,"This soundtrack evokes the emotions of the film better than just about any other soundtrack I can imagine, especially given the complexity of emtotions that this film provokes. Nonetheless the music is perfectly matched to the scenes, and unlike many movies in which the score simply hides behind all the action and dialogue this score seems to play a game of counterpoint with the movie often elevating and contrasting scenes that would not be nearly as powerful if viewed without the soundtrack. Of course this CD is also a great work without the movie and would stand by itself very well. The music is very original and quite different from anything else I have heard in modern classical music."
5,Best Soundtrack of all time!,I got this soundtrack/score before watching the movie. The movie won an academy award for Best Soundtrack and after listening to it you will know why.
5,Get the real soundtrack,"If you enjoyed the wonderful score for this film, I would definitely recommend purchasing the ""film score"" rather than ""music from the original soundtrack."" The soundtrack contains tracks from The Who, Betty Carter and others. However, only a few of Thomas Newman's excellent film score were included. Buy the ""original score"" to get the entire real soundtrack from the film. You won't be disappointed."
4,"Great disc, somewhat disappointing master quality","This is a fantastic piece of work. Thomas (cousin of ""Short People"" Randy Newman and son of the late Alfred Newman) has created several sonic masterpieces and this one is certainly one of my favorites. I fell in love with the music while watching the movie for the first time in a theatre in Taipei - I got online as soon as I returned to my hotel room and ordered it. I continue to pull it out a lot more often than I ever expected.The only disappointment with the disc is poor quality of the mastering process, with a low dynamic range that sometimes gets in the way of the creative instrumentation of this CD. This is a nit, however, and I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for highly creative music."
5,Amazing,"There isn't much I can add to some of the great reviews here.I have been listening to this soundtrack from the first day it was released.I have given copies to friends and family.There was like a 3-4 year period where I would listen to this in my office daily.Now, I have it mixed with tracks from Erin Brokovich (also amazing), and a few from Revolutionary Road .. This is one of those soundtracks, that not only brought so much feeling to the movie, but also can stand on it's own. I find this to not only be an essential soundtrack cd, but music in general. If you don't own this, or haven't seen the movie, do both."
5,One of my favorites!,"'American Beauty' has the most involving, original and moving score of the year! Thomas Newman, the composer of scores for such films as 'The Horse Whisperer', 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'In the Bedroom', 'Little Women' and 'The Green Mile' does it again with this score; the likes of which you've never heard before! When was the last time you heard instruments such as tablas, detuned mandolins, bird calls, dulcimers, ukuleles, banjos, etc all blended together flawlessly to form some breathtaking pieces of music? Even if you have not seen the film 'American Beauty', you will appreciate the subtle beauty of this score. The themes are haunting and memorable. I find myself unable to choose favorites on this score, all of the pieces are so amazing! ""Dead Already"" (the main theme) is often reused in later pieces, soemtimes in subtle ways, sometimes in apparent ways. Many of these pieces are rather dream like, almost as if they came from a dream."
5,The music is very good.,The music made the movie great. This guy has a lot of talent and I hope he does the music for more movies. He did a great job in the Shawshank Redemption and the Road to Perdition. All 3 great movies with great music.
5,Hypnotic Music that made the Movie,"After re-watching American Beauty, I realized that the dreamy music IS the movie, that and Mena Suvartii's dream sequences. Similar to the way Twin Peaks wouldn't have seemed nearly as good without it's soundtrack. This is not the American Beauty soundtrack; this is the Original Motion Picture Score. The hypnotic Xylophone Music that plays during Kevin Spacy's monologues and visions of Mena Suvartii in a bed of roses."
4,American Beauty; Thomas Newman's finest melodies,"This soundtrack is exactly what I wanted it to be. Very beautiful melodies, mostly piano led with underlying orchestrated richness - Newman composes this from his soul, perfectly blending with director Mendes' American Beauty's chilling tone and spontaneous edge to art. Very recommended."
5,can't go wrong with newman,"american beauty, which despite its somewhat cliched characters and overwrought satire, was a film well worth the price of a movie ticket. the true highlight is the score, which i purchased after hearing ""dead already"" in the movie's trailer. many of the tracks are busy (""root beer"", ""spartanette""), and may not be pleasant to the ears of traditional soundtrack buffs. but it is tracks like these that set american beauty apart, giving it a raw simplistic earthen feel. newman always manages to tap into the right emotional veins for the movies he scores, but american beauty is a new trick up his sleeve: the ultimate condensation of his percussion skills, and the purest union a score could have with the actions and words of a film."
5,Short but sweet....,"I've seen AMERICAN BEAUTY five times, and I remember how struck I was by its soundtrack, particularly by Thomas Newman's incidental music. Like the movie, his music will stay with you long after you've heard it. This is the perfect score for a perfect movie!"
5,I LOVED IT!,"I bought the score for the film AMERICAN BEAUTY, and I have listened over 6 times. Thomas Newman is one of the most underrated composers out there, but this may well be his best score yet. With songs like ""Dead Already,"" ""Structure & Discipline,"" ""Still Dead"" and ""Any Other Name,"" this CD is great to listen to. For those who love percussion, this is an absolute must. Using very unique instruments like the kim-kim drums and two steel guitars, they mix together to make an amazing score for truly one of the most original films of this decade. Go listen to it! You will like it!"
3,American Beauty,"Does anyone know of the name of the song that is played on the trailer when the flowers are falling down on Lester? I believe its an instrumental rock song. It's not on either CD that has come out. The movie was great and I only wish they had included more of the songs that were in the movie. Dead Already & Because, are two great songs from the movie."
1,"""Music that explains the beauty of the world""?!","I am rather taken aback by the reams of positive reviews for what is very mediocre music. By all means, listen for yourself (indeed, I would say it's mandatory in this case), but this score sounds like something a musically competent 13 yr-old would have put together on discovering a glockenspiel in the house.Uninspired, repetitive. Truly, there's little as subjective as personal musical taste..."
2,"Missing that song from the ""seduction Scene""- I found it!","I was VERY upset when I realized that the song during the scene when Kevin Spacey kisses his daughter's friend was missing from the soundtrack. It took me FOREVER to find the song. I even own the DVD and it was not even listed. I finally found it. It is called ""Don't let it bring you down"" by Annie Lennox (I think she re-did it). The Album name is ""Medusa"" and it is actually an AWESOME album that I would rate 5 stars! I have heard that they put out a 2nd soundtrack that HAS it, but I have not even looked yet. I hope this helps you out!"
5,Transforms,"This CD, although short, is a real keeper. When you first put it on, it will recall all the wonderful parts of its namesake movie, but upon further listenings, the layers fall away and the true beauty of the music takes on its own life."
3,Useful but not very helpful,"I found the book to be useful as a reference but not as a way to learn pl/sql. The main problem is with the examples. There are numerous examples throughout the book and they all seem to be centered around the idea of students, courses, rooms, etc. Through the use of these examples, the author illistrates many of the concepts of pl/sql. However, I find that the auther gets bogged down in showing the examples as opposed to illistrating the concepts.One of the must used statements in SQL is the select statement. However, the author chooses to use the insert, delete, and update statements much more than the select statement.The author references previous example material frequently in the book. Unless you have a perfect memory, this creates a lot of page flipping in order to review the referenced example and grasp the concept. It would be far better to illistrate the concept in a single, straight forward example."
5,A Handsome Book,This is a book that i have ever had.This book cleared all my concepts of Oracle 8 sql.I simply want to point your attention to this book if you really want to get the Oracle 8.
1,Not for beginners,I have not been able to get out of chapter 1. Telling how to get SQL plus to execute an sql statement or how to create and load the sample databases would be a great start. Tried to run the included tables.sql and got errors.
4,Good reference of PL/SQL programming!,I use this book for reference of PL/SQL programming. Ther're some examples in the book. The format and index of this book is good too.
2,Average standard,"I feel the book should contain the working examples. some of examples in this book challenges the reader's debugging power. For the first time reader this kind of interaction is not welcome. for eg; in the page 818 , eg. relating to LOB variables, the sql is not working. particularly for the clob declaration . the error says ""default character set is of varying width"". Please give the intial reader with some working examples."
4,excellent book for development and reference !!!,"I found the book altogether excellent but the examples all center around a class room environment. Most development is for businesses centred around employees. The section on exception handling needs additional information, which is found in other books on the same subject. Overall, its an excellent book, well written and a great help in development and plsql programming !!!"
3,These reviews are bogus!,"I've read this book and it is filled with errors. Have you noticed that the email addresses of these ""reviewers"" are hotmail.com, yahoo.com and oracle.com?That really makes me angry!"
5,Nice Product,This product makes refinishing easier. The sheets are convenient and can easily be cut to more suitable sizes as needed.
4,Review of sustainabilities and cities overcoming Automobile Dependency,The book made me stop and think how the automobile has influenced our culture and how it determines many of the decisions that I make. The book is a good read and well worth the price I paid for it.gardentricks123
5,Its all here...,This excellent book will give you the insight to understand how transportation and cities interact.
2,"eh, so so...","well, it is smudge proof, but definitely not waterproof. It cracks and peels very easily.I remember when I wore it to school one day, and peices of it were falling off of my face.Its definitely a decent eyeliner for the price and everyday casual wear, but its definitely not an award winning eyeliner"
3,Not the best for liner but great for designs.,"I bought this having high hopes.. after using it a couple times i do not use it as liner anymore. Dries out really really fast, it cracks, & it peels. I notice it works fabulous for designs on my eyes..like drawing lightning bolts & leopard spots..etc. I recommend to buy it for drawing designs on ur eyes."
4,Overall decent,Only thing I felt uncomfortable with was that I noticed a tear in the product packaging. The liner was a bit liquidy first but now it's better.
2,"Maybelline New York Ultra-Liner Liquid Liner, Waterproof, Black 135L-01 , .25 fl oz (7.3 ml)","ES DE PESIMA CALIDAD CUANDO LO APLICAS EN EL CONTORNO DE LOS OJOS, DESPUES DE SECARSE EMPIEZA A PARTIRSE Y SE SALE SE DESPRENDE DE LA PIEL ES MALO"
2,Not the Best....,this liner goes on nice and is easy to use but it peels and cracks within in hours and it is not waterproof.
2,Looks Great..Then Flakes & Smudges,"Goes are great! Unfortunately, the tip isn't a felt tip, its more like a mini-paint brush, so it tends to get all over if you're not careful.Pros:*Great color (for a little while)*Dries QuicklyCons:*Smudges*Rubs off easily*Don't recommend with OILY eyelids"
2,"Looks like a great product, but....",It flakes off on its own. No one wants an eyeliner that disapears after 20 min of wearing it. It goes on smoothly but then comes off little by little
5,Carlson Labs Nutra-Support Prostate Gels,"I began using saw palmetto products when I reached 50 years, and I believe Carlson prostate support has the necessary ingredients to keep my maturing prostate from getting out of control. So far, I typically need to getup once a night to go to the bathroom. Using my father as my lesson, I preferred using saw palmetto rather than prescription drugs."
5,"Same name, different performers.","Like a previous reviewer said, not to be confused with some progressive wanker-band who share the same name. THIS is the real deal, even if it is only a collection of demos and rehearsal recordings. Still filthy enough to deck the halls of CBGBs (r.i.p.) with."
1,"Same name, different performers.",Do not confuse this group with the avant garde Belgian artists on the Crammed Discs label. The Belgian group centered around Marc Hollander and shared members with Aksak Maboul.
5,Is This For Real???,"I found this CD sort of by accident. I was looking for the old Treasure Island DVD (the one from the thirties, not the Disney flop) and some how I reached this disc. After hearing the downloads, I couldn't stop laughing, so I ordered it. Is this a real society? The whole CD is so much fun and wacky. I noticed that someone said it's great for children, it is, but I love it myself. The guy singing is so serious, yet he's talking about cheese (lots of it), bananas, monkeys, wenches, grog. In one song there is a list of different apples. Anyway the address on the CD is in California. Treasure Island is my favorite book, I've read it many times since I was a little boy, and even I didn't really remember the character Ben Gunn. Thanks to this strange CD, I went back and read it once more. Okay, that's it."
2,Good looking but cheap,"The product looks grand but its easly broken. When the Xbox 360 skin arived it was damaged. the one of the plastic coverings for the skin was pealing off. The front part never worked so don't even bother. I would say if you are willing to spend the money for this buy it, if not find one in a store that you can see and is good quality."
3,WISH THEY HAD IT IN PINK,it seems like all the faceplates or skins i have seen for the xbox 360 have all been themed for guys... i am a girl and own a 360 and would like to see them come out in sum kind of girl themed skins.. preveribly pink.. i am disapointed that there isnt!
4,Hard rocking country boys.,18 WHEELS TO HELL can hold its own anywhere on this planet. I've never heard country and hard driveing rock put together so well together on a cd before. The Cowslingers have what it takes!
3,Warm enough. Arm cuffs got loose. May be little higher priced at 15 USD,I am slightly less satisfied with the product as its arm cuffs got loose within days. Warm enough for moderate winters. But you may get it for less at Burlington or Gabriel stores.
4,Very nice thermals,I got it for my son who is an OTR trucker and is not used to cold weather. He was very pleased with the item and said it really helped with keeping him warm.I would recommend this item.
3,A Rockwell Portrait,"Donald Walton does an outstanding job writing A Rockwell Portrait. Having been a collaborator with Norman Rockwell on several projects for the Franklin Mint, Walton became fast friends with the congenial artist. Walton's friendship with Norman and his wife, Molly, afforded him an intimate look at Norman's work, life and personality. Norman's art had already endeared him to his adoring fans, but this inside look at the artist made them love him even more.Although his art portrayed, what is now called ""Rockwellian"", people and situations, his life was far from that image. Walton is able to gently reveal the trials and victories the artist experienced in both his personal and professional lives.If you love Norman Rockwell's work, you will love this insight into his personal journey.He truly is the ""Mark Twain of the American Art."""
5,jointer blade,Used it for the first time yesterday. It cut a really smooth slot. The biscuits (porter cable brand) fit like a glove. I reccomend.
1,dont read this book!,"i had to read this book for an english non-fiction assignment. the only reason i chose it was because it has big writing, really ugly pictures on every other page, and it is only 115 pages long. it seemed to be the perfect book! so i started reading it, only to find out that it was the [...] book ever. the plot is ok, but in general, the way the book is written is at a very ""easy"" level english, which makes the book, a bit boring, and there is too much description. maybe this is because it was translated from Dutch, but in general it was not interesting. the truth is, it took me a month to read it. if i had chosen a longer book, but more interesting, i probably would've gotten through it a lot faster. in conclusion, dont read this book, unless you have a loooot of time to waste!"
1,I would prefer that Kathryn died and Elaine survived,"I like the hero....but the heroinne....oh my god with her fighting all the time...I hated her I only ask myself when is she going to shut up....and then guy would kiss her and I say oh my god how can you stop so low just for a beautiful body, she is not for you!!!!!!!!!!I was always hoping that he would fell in love with a servant maid or something....Elizabeth and Hugh story that was worth it....that is why I give it a star."
1,Preview Music,"I was looking for ""Battle Flag"" by Lo-Fidelity All-Stars on this CD, and I'm disappointed. It's a great song, and really seemed to fit the movie when it's been used in almost all of the previews I've seen. Bad omission, in my book -- it would've been a good song for this movie."
1,"No, it would not play","nkc, not same, so, i'll go. now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country."
5,THE BEST,It is and always has been one of the best movies ever. The stars play there parts very well and it only leaves the imagenation open to what could have happen to pearl on that day with the fire power of a modern day carrier.
5,Let's find Pokemon review,One of the best pokemon books I ever read. It's really fun. You really want to try it. It's great. I give this book a 10 out of 10.
5,held interest,very much like a wheres waldo book. it was bought for a long summer road trip. it held their interests and worked liked a charm during a very boring car ride. recommend for any pokemon fan between 4 and 8. also would recommend if you like the wheres waldo books
4,Awesome.,"I love this book, it is like a Where's Waldo but with pokemon. But I don't recommend this book to little kids because its not as easy as an I Spy book. An older kid or a true pokemon fan would love it."
2,A real disappointment,"I bought this for my grandson and was very disappointed. The pictures are OK, but some of the things you need to find are lost in the center binding. Obviously not well edited or planned, and unfair to a child who has grown up with ""I Spy"" and expects to be successful in his search. I do not recommend this book."
3,Quickly lost interest,"We bought this for my 6 year old for Christmas for his new DS. At first he loved it, he seemed really into it, and tried to explain the concept to me a few times. I didn't understand it at all and it seemed really boring. Well I was right I guess... He only played with it for 2 or 3 days and ever since its been sitting in his room untouched. This is virtually unbelievable for a 6 year old boy! I would not buy this again.... but I'm thinking maybe its for an older child???"
4,fun for the whole family!,"My kids (ages 5 and 3) love this book! I don't know much about Pokemon, but you don't need to know the characters to read this book. It is basically a ""Where's Waldo"" type book where you look for Pokemon characters."
1,"Mr. Easylanguage, where's the beef?","The book promises far more than it actually delivers! It appears that orginally the author's goals might have been more ambitious but somehow, by the time he wrote the book, there were whole sections that do nothing more than list functions without so much as a one line of explanation!The writing is rather poor and the book is poorly organized. It was written before TradeStation2000i was released and makes all sorts of confusing speculative remarks about TradeStation5.0 (which was released as 2000i)!The book doesn't discuss programming techniques applicable to Easylanguage. basically it is difficult to say just what it is that the book does try to address!I do not recommend this book."
1,Why buy now that the same information is available for free?,"In TradeStation (I use 6), Under the Help menu, there is a Books menu item. Selecting it and you will have access to very good EasyLanguage for free (in pdf form). There is really no need to buy a book that's now outdated, and not very well-written."
3,Good resource for naval architecture of the period,"Good, though general, information about naval architecture of the period. The title describes the book well. However, it stop at the decks, anyone interested in rigging details will have to look further. Good book for modelers."
5,Bluegrass At Its Best,Rhonda Vincent and her band deliver great music which will lift your spirits. I saw Ms. Vincent in concert last week and it was a time of fun and musical artistry. Her last two releases are equally good so get them.
5,Words can't do this CD justice...,"Awards don't always tell the whole story, but it is no coincidence that THIS CD was the most-decorated Bluegrass release of it's year. In most albums, even GOOD ones, there are a few cuts that are ""clunkers"". As a friend of mine remarked to me, this album has NO bad cuts - just ""varying degrees of good."" The instrumentalists are the best in the business. The harmonies are so beautiful and tight the hairs on the back of your neck will likely stand at attention. The chosen selections are great material. But the BEST thing about this CD is Rhonda Vincent's crystal-clear and evocative vocals. When was the last time an album so impressed hard-to-please die-hard Bluegrass fans? You can't think of one either?"
1,Pathetic,"To be fair, I only watched 15 minutes of this pathetic production.I am only speculating but it appears that a group of overweight men went shopping for Roman toys at Toys-R-Us, tied red table clothes around their necks as capes, and began prancing around their backyard pretending to be Hannibal against the Romans. Meanwhile, a narrator repeats himself over and over about how terrible the war would be for Carthage.In these first 15 minutes, my 17 year old noticed that they showed a Roman eagle and she said ""Didn't Marius introduce the Roman eagle into the military a century AFTER Hannibal?""If you are looking for an entertaining documentary on Rome, I suggest the History Channels ""Rome, Rise and Fall of an Empire"" rather than this title. If you are interested in less entertaining but more rigorous study, The Teaching Company has several good lecture series on Rome."
4,Woodworking before power tools,Book does a good job of describing the use of a wide variety of hand tools for the cutting and shaping of wood for everything from fence posts to furniture. Diagrams could have been larger with less shading so that the details of the tools was clearer.
3,Average,"Thisbook is average and could be better there a are better books out there, this is for more advanced wood workers, not beginners. Also it can be very boring, could be alot better!"
1,CD or 45rpm?,"I purchased the James Blunt ""You're Beautiful"" CD for my Wife.She loves the song, so I thought a cd of the Artist would be OK.Well; the Title is correct, Thats the ONLY song on it!OOps; there was one other song on it. This was like buying an ""Old Fashioned"" 45rpm record (with the ""Hit Song"" on one side, and a ""Filler Song"" on the ""Flip Side"")This is a RIP-OFF! You're buying a CD with only ONE SONG ON IT!!"
5,heartfelt,"this guy, wow, he sings from the heart this particular song, ""your beautiful"" when he was on Oprah Winfreys show he stated, this is a true incidence, he was in love and the girl turned to another, but he will always remember her, and sings his heart out, or how he will remember her as beautiful, to him, ""your beautiful, to me"" you feel in his voice his sincerety, this one was sung from the heart. i hope he will continue his career as a singer. Oprah loved him."
1,James Needs To Lay Off The Blunts,"This is the #1 Worse Song of 2006 (#2 is ""SexyBack"" by Justin Timberfake). For real. His voice is awful and I don't know who is worse: James Blunt, Macy Gray, or Shakira. Imagine the three of them doing a performance together on a stage. It would be pure he11."
4,You're Beautiful--so is this song,"This song beautifully captures the pathos we all have felt I'm sure. Like, when you meet a Canadian girl in Brazil who is the girl of your dreams but who lives too far away, is too young, and probably doesn't think you're the cat's meow. I really prefer the word ""flying"" and not the other one. The other word changes the meaning in a way I do not think Mr. Blunt wants. Anyway, I'm flying high listening to the song. Blunt's voice alternates defiance and serenity which are exactly how one feels in that type of situation. Here's to Canadian girls you meet in Brazil."
1,"Good song, bad price.","I'd suggest that you buy James Blunt's full album, Back to Bedlam. This is a waste of money."
3,This song is quite tolerable. Probably one of four of His tunes are. 3.6 stars,"I like James Blunt enough to write a review about His music. Most of it is very thought out and showcases at least decent songwriting. For He is just that: a singer-songwriter. And I highly respect that.However, there are times when His music comes off as pointless, mind-numbing and overbearingly annoying. >_<q SeeAll the Lost Soulsfor proof.I commend Him for songs like this, as well as High and another two that stand out (one being on His abysmally-stupid and obviously-rushedAll the Lost Souls: Give Me Some Love).Overall, I couldn't recommend ANY of His albums just yet; They're far too monotonous, repetitive and dreary. Yet I *DO* see a Light at the end of this tunnel. Maybe in an album or two, He will pick up the pace and give Us some well-needed variety in song material.Here's to Hoping!3.6 stars."
2,James Blun,"Did not realize when I made this purchase that there were only a couple of songs on this cd. For a few more bucks, I could have purchased his new cd at the store."
3,A bit small and price is questionable,"it is cute, but smaller than I thought it would be. Maybe I didnt read the fine print. Its basically a clay saucer for a potted plant with ceramic glaze on the inside. (and the hooks and chains to hang it) For what this likely costs to make the $23 is questionable, let alone the supposed full price of almost $70. But it is cute and does the trick."
1,Cracked and disintegrated in 6 months.,"It was filled with water and being terra cotta it was porous. Bottom line is that it cracked in half in six months. Didn't leave it out in freezing temperatures either. Stick with plastic, concrete, or metal for a bird bah."
5,nice,"I'm happy with this birdfeeder. It's not real big, but the birds use it, and it's quite decent. I hang it from under my deck, so it works out well."
5,Latin Music Lover,"I have listened to all the songs in this ablum and I must say that most of time when a CD comes out, not all the songs are good; In this CD all the songs are great. Its dancing music as well as listening to a beautiful ballet. I took the CD to a function of mixed people, and asked the DJ to play it. Everyone got up to dance! The more you play the Cd, the better it sounds....."
3,complete what??,Help me understand. It says complete but the total number of tracks of 'Chambers Music' and 'Whims' have 16 tracks. There are only 11 here. Seems to me that at least several tracks are missing.
1,Disapointed,"We bought six and all of the glass globes were out of round, the filaments are starting to sag after six hours and one failed within 4 hours. They are halogen and better (whiter) than standard incandescent bulbs but I hoped for better quality."
2,Poor translation,"I agree that the translation is inadequate, sometimes to the point of misconstruing Rousseau's intent. The omission of the majority of Rousseau's footnotes in the Second Discourse is a poor choice, and the editors' own notes are rarely illuminating. The additional material, however, is appreciated."
3,God At War,"Enjoyed the book. Got here quickly and in good shape. Deep ideas. A little too wordy, but if you can get through the educational jargon, he makes some great observations that can change your view of the spiritual realm."
3,Raises more questions than it answers...,"Being raised in a Charismatic/Pentecostal environment and then thrust into the academic world of reformed theology, I found this book to be very intriguing, and yet at the same time, unsettling. For those who ask the question, ""If God is a loving God and He is in complete control, than why is there evil in the world?"", this read will give you a different perspective, perhaps a more biblical one? Those who affirm Charismatic/Pentecostal beliefs, will greatly appreciate this books indepth approach to spiritual warfare. However, the author does indeed raise more questions than answers. For one, ""Just how much control does God have?"". Dr Boyd's teachings look good in theory, but the practical dimension is a little bit foggy. Over all this work will captivate the minds of atheists, challenge Calvinists, and delight Arminianists. No matter what school of thought you are from, this book is a must read."
1,Dry and unappealing,Too much history and theology to make for good reading to keep me interested. Never even finished the first chapter.
2,"Wins the Battle, Loses the War","Some good scholarship here. But continuing the war metaphor, this book wins the battle (defending God's goodness) but losing the war (jettisoning God's attributes). A terrible disappointment. Read John Frame's *No Other God* (2001) or Millard Erickson or Bruce Ware (or C.S. Lewis years before the fact!) on the deep problems with Boyd's Open Theism."
5,thought-provoking and practical,"There is a wealth of incredibly thought-provoking material in 'God at War', in the main text and also in the endnotes. This book is impressively researched, and the amount of works referenced in the endnotes is staggering. You will definitely have your traditional views provoked in some way by the thesis of this book, so be ready, but rest assured that Boyd is very faithful to the Bible and is not setting forth anything heretical. He's just not afraid to think or to disagree with some big-name church theologians throughout history. The book is not just scholarship and dry theology, though, and includes some very practical and emotional sections in the chapters. The introduction to the book and chapter one, 'Hearing Zosia', are by the themselves some of the most intense stuff I have ever read."
1,Greg Boyd had dangerous information,"I used to be in the Greg Boyd camp... He seemed like a nice guy.But, this book just goes to far. In the end all confidence in God isreplaced with this warped warfare worldview, that is dualistic andhas God at the mercies of demons and fallen humanity.GREG BOYD READ A BIBLE, put down the philosophy books and pagan myth booksand just READ.GOD's power is absolute."
5,New Favorite,"I am so happy with this purchase. The illusrations are amazing and the poetry is so descriptive it makes you feel like you are in Ohio experiencing the awesome nature show for yourself. I love reading it to my baby and it will be my favorite for the rest of my life. I don't know why there are not more reviews for this, as I think it should be a topselling award winner. "" Nanosecond, Lightning Flash, One one-thousand-- thunder Crash""""Downpour slowing, clouds run dry. Lightning flickers, brightening sky."" Love this!"
3,"Good songs, an ok CD",Buena combinacion de canciones populares que sin duda han sido del agrado del publico. Sin duda alguna que contiene sus clasicos y es rico escuchar sus temas. La combinacion de temas es dificil encontrarla en otros cds.
5,Deep in the Heart,"Found a new author, and she is great. Have read a few, but wlll keep reading. Never want to put them down."
3,GOOD BOOK,This was a good book especially if you buy it really cheap. The characters are likable although I have a tendency to become annoyed with the female leads before the end. Once you get to the end and find out who the bad guy is and why you'll think it was a drawn out and unfulfilling. You may find yourself asking OK WTH! Purchase for a good quick read when your bored.
5,A Once a year Watcher,"This film is one I can watch once a year. It is somewhat a narrowly constrained film, but it just watching so many great actors work is enjoyable. The plot is not really believable but still a well structured story, more of a fantasy scenario than anything based on truth. But it gets its point across in a story where there are distinct sides and each side is somewhat hamstrung in playing for all the marbles, but one has to win. There is no middle ground, the lines are distinct but only visible to the players and the viewer."
2,Too cold,I first installed the 180 degree engine thermostat as recommended by Hypertech. I installed the fan switch and then monitored the engine temperature to see when the fan came on. At 180 degrees the fan came on. I continued to monitor the temperature with the engine off until the fan went off at 118 degrees. At these temperatures the fan would run continuously. I did this test twice with the same results. I returned the switch. It should have come on at 200 degrees and off at 185 degrees.
4,"Good Book,with current info",Good book filled with current info on correct painting procedures. This book is very useful for all levels of body shop personnel or just a backyard painter.
4,Gold Magic Shears. HMM.,"I was reading different reviews on other shears, but they were so expensive, so I gave this a try, and its alright, and gets the job done."
3,Works but hard to use,"The scissoring action is a little slow, so it takes some force to use these scissors. I bought them to trim my bangs and not have to worry about whether I have cut them straight. They have the effect on my bangs which I was going for, a texturized look."
1,Poor ideas and highly condescending to 2nd time brides,To be fair there are a few good ideas but by and large - this is not a good book. In addition - this book's attitude that 2nd time brides really should focus on tiny small weddings that no one will notice. Bridal Bargains is much better and gives practical information.
1,Really how to have a cheap and tacky wedding....,"For starters, if you want to start saving money then don't buy this book or waste the gas to get you to the library! By far the WORST wedding book I have ever read (and I've read lots of them). This book has hideous reception suggestions such as using your parish CAFETERIA to host your event. Using olives as an ""appetizer"", having a fake foam cake, having an amatuer dj who plays ""for free to get experience"" and many other bad ideas. Words cannot express how bad I thought this book was. I actually called another woman and read her a few quotes to get her opinion and she laughed so hard she actually cried. The fact that the author kept plugging her other stupid wedding planning books was almost as tacky as some of her suggestions. Right up there with the tackiness of a cash bar."
1,BIg Wedding on a Small Budget,The book is ok. It came in great time and in wonderful condition. Perfect price. Just not what i thought it was. Great seller too. Definetly buy from the seller again. By the way i am a woman but using my future husbands credit card. Hence the name you see is his.
3,Mediocre,"Most of the advice in this book was pretty repetitive... Basically every item you need for your wedding you can either: buy full price, buy discount, rent (no thanks, I don't want to rent my wedding dress), have someone make for you, or make yourself. There, I saved you the cost of the book. Also the whole book just seems really dated and reflects wedding trends reminiscent of the 80s and 90s with lots of white lattice/wicker, crazy fashion and just not very elegant. Some good tips, but nothing you couldn't find online through message boards."
3,Worth the money,"I paid ten bucks so..... It had information that I may not have thought of on my own, although I thought it lack some spicific ideas. Also photos would've been nice. Maybe of a few weddings that had been planned using it, etc..."
5,high quality,"I am not a chef, but I do alot of cutting. I was very impressed with the craftsmanship of this knife. It is the sharpest knife I have ever used. Fits nicely in my hand. It is a bit on the heavy side, which I like, so that would be my only concern for other buyers. Very nice knife."
4,It's good but there's better......,"I liked this book, but mine is better. Of course I am biased, I am like that. Secret Habits of Successful Bastards is the best self-help book for people who are too nice!"
2,Not like the picture shows!,"Sorry, but this necklace looked much bigger in stone size, and larger on lenght in the picture shown. So I was a bit disappointed when it arrived!It certainly is more fitting for a teenager, I think."
4,Great products and company,The products are great but so is the company I ordered it from. They are very customer oriented and go above and beyond to prove that.
5,May be High Point of English Song,"Whenever I listen to any renditions of English art songs, going from Elizabethan times to the modern, as by Percy Grainger, I always dispair at how uninteresting they are when compared to the great German, French, and Italian art song repetoires. It seems as if the English can never quite wrest their genre from its folk roots and become a 'classic' music realization. I cringe at the Shakspearean 'hey nonny nonnies' and the 19th century compositions, none of which are as good even as Stephen Foster at his best.But here is Purcell, and I believe I've found an author of English song I can really enjoy. To be sure, he has not entirely kicked the straw from all of the lyrics, but out of this 74 minutes of performance, I can easily listen to it many times over. And, as it stands at the moment, the prices for these CD's are a real bargain, if you like English song."
5,Best I have ever owned!,This is a must have! The color doesn't bleed and the shape is mound like--very easy to hold and use. Absolutely the best I have ever owned!
2,A cold night for alligators,"This is an odd patchwork of live performances going back to 1985, some unreleased studio cuts, and Roky's own disjointed ramblings (called ""Rokyspeak"") that doesn't gel very coherently. Then again, Roky's career itself has been a disjointed mess. He's depended more on the kindness of musicians and producers to provide him with sympathetic settings (as in the carefully-crafted 1994 album, ""All That May Do My Rhyme"") than with this kind of compilation, which doesn't even compliment his status as a cult figure. It's a stretch to call any of these recordings inspired, and nothing here does Roky any justice. Given Roky's history, hearing him strangle Reed's ""Heroin"" for six minutes is beyond bizarre. For fans and completists only, who know what they're getting."
2,Really disappointed!!,"I am very disappointed with this product. I am a Chai Tea lover and I am now stuck with 6 cans of Chai-tea I won't use. In order for it to even have a tea taste I have to add Chai leaves and spices. It is mostly milky powder and lacks taste. If you are lactose intolerant, don't even try it. I would not waste my money again and will probably dump the remainder of 5 and 3/4 tins and call it a day. I am just telling it like it is. Sorry."
4,A book that shows the con mans world,"This book is one of the most interesting books I've read. It shows you how a con man can get into your pocket and ""fleece"" you. It also suggests how to avoid this. Though some of the games are outdated, the principles of how and who to trust remain the same. Watch who you trust and read How Con Games Work"
5,The intimacy of the life of a black man in America,"This book has changed my life. I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Parks here in Minnesota during a homecoming to celebrate his life's work. A choice of weapons vividly illustrates how Mr. Parks overcame all of the odds one man could face, partiuclarly a black man in the twentieth century. His journey from Kansas to St.Paul to Harlem and beyond is a must read for anyone who wants to truly understand the hypocrisy and paradox of the American ideal."
5,If I have to explain you would not understand.,"The man, the myth, the legend. El Vez combines radical Chincano activist politics, The King's musical stylings, and showmanship in a infectious combination of ironic yet positive grooves. You just gotta buy it. Tell 'em Miguelito sent you!"
2,Mexicorn,"El Vez is the Mexican Elvis. His gimmick is rewriting old Elvis songs with lyrics that relate to Mexico. It isn't as funny as you would think. He sings about Latino things like green cards, gangs and Cinco de Mayo. You can tell he is trying to promote a positive image for Mexican-Americans, but it just isn't very entertaining. I wanted to enjoy this CD, but I didn't. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the unlisted bonus track, which is an informal version of ""Got a Lot O' Livin' to Do!""."
2,great concept poorly implemented,"Not as good as it should be. the gauge falls out, there are no ""o"" rings on the end caps and the wood lining falls out.i had a great one before but lost it and this is a weak attempt."
3,jamshe,These dishtowels came in the mail very quickly but was disappointed in the thinness of the material. They are a beautiful mustard color and are great as accents but not to actually use in the kitchen. I would of returned them but didn't want the hassel. I will not be ordering from this vendor again.
5,Remember the King!,"The best Elvis ever! The King reaches into the depths of his soul when performing gospel. Expertly narrated, with the full songs. The tears, the sweat, the songs in this video almost touch God. If you only buy one Elvis THIS IS THE ONE! Don't miss it!"
5,A Spiritual experience,"This may be the best documetary on Elvis yet produced, but I think it could have been made even better. When I looked at the videos I noticed that a lot of clips were taken from Aloha From Hawaii. A concert were he didn't do one single spiritual performance (?). And the never before seen footage of Elvis isn't much. But I rate them with 5 stars, because it shows Elvis, not as an angel or a saint, but with love, which he diserves. And the editing is just beautiful. I recomend it for everybody who likes gospel, spirituals, or Elvis."
3,Don't really care for it.,"This was a gift for my husband who loves ""useless knowledge."" This book never seemed to captivate him and it sits on a shelf now, unread."
4,Cool,I like the book but i thought that it was stupid to say immature Napoleon concocted his battle strategies in a sandbox this is still done today we use them alot. Other than that its lives up to its title alot f useless info.
5,Works well. fair price,"This basket is sturdy and fits fairly well. I do have to set the handle bar hooks angled up to prevent tire rubbing. Besides that, no complaints."
5,wald bicycle basket,"I love this basket . Just the right size for my needs , built well and looks great ."
3,I used Nair Hair Removal for the first ...,"I used Nair Hair Removal for the first time. It did go on well. My hair on my legs was longer than it should have been and took longer than normal. But it did leave my legs smooth. As for myself, I wouldn't use the wax. I still prefer shaving."
2,"I test drove the Nair Quick, 15-second microwave ...","I test drove the Nair Quick, 15-second microwave wax product. Overall, I didn't like it. It didn't remove all the hair from the area and I wasn't supposed to reapply it to the same area immediately. So I still had to shave. I found it inconvenient to have to keep going back to the microwave in the kitchen to reheat the product. The best part is that the wax can be removed with water. That's a great feature. I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,The product worked very well. I will continue ...,The product worked very well. I will continue to use it. I highly recommend it!!
3,This is a great product if you like ...,"This is a great product if you like waxing your legs. I wasn't all that familiar with waxing, but the directions were very clear and easy to follow. My only objection is that there is some pain when removing the cloth. Also left my skin a little red. But I have sensitive skin, so I don't recommend this for that type skin. So, I'd say it's a good overall product."
2,I wasn't too impressed with this product. It ...,"I wasn't too impressed with this product. It will remove fine hair from areas that have little hair. But as far as using this product to get rid of unwanted hair under arms, etc., I don't believe that it works very well. I also experienced very dry skin in areas that I used the product. Maybe someone else will have a better experience."
2,stick to the original mix.,The R&B mix really takes a lot away from the NRG of the original. Don't feel the need to pick up this extra single if you already have the full length CD.
5,unpredictable,"It's great when you can't guess the bad guy in a ""whodunit"" book andyou can't wait to turn the next page to find out who did."
5,Amazing and emotional!,"Not guilty is a complex and emotionally moving story about a woman trying to prove the innocence of her troubled teenaged son. The author flawlessly interweaves the past history of her main character's past with her present life, creating a drama that the reader is not soon to forget. This book was a page turner and kept me coming back for more. Just when you thought you had it all figured out...surprise! There was another twist around the bend. This is the first book by this author that I have had the privilege of reading. I will definitely read more of her titles after this fabulous book."
3,Readable book....but not a thriller,I kept turning the pages and thought this was a fast paced read but not extraordinary. The plot is decent but there were still questions left unanswered for me.
3,Good...But Not Great,"I think that this book is worth reading, but it's not an edge of your seat page turner like some other thrillers. The plot is interesting (if not a wee bit far fetched) and will keep your attention. It just doesn't get thrilling and scary and make you anxious like some other books I've read.It is the story of Keely Bennett. Her first husband committed suicide and her son found him. While dealing with this tragedy, Mark Weaver swoops in as an old friend of Richard's who has to come to help Keely with the legal aspects of his death. He falls in love, they get married and have a baby together. Too good to be true? Yes! Mark is found dead...presumable an accident in their pool. Until a woman scorned, the District Attorney, tries to pin it all on Keely's son. The story from there is about Keely trying to protect her son...and what they find out about Mark's death. It unravels at a quick pace and doesn't leave you wondering for too long.It's a good book...but not too ""thrilling."""
4,Kept me guessing!,"I have only discovered Patricia MacDonald not to long ago and have been devouring anything I can read by her. Not Guilty was agreat story about Keely Bennett who has a 9 yr. old son and a husband who suffered from terrible migraines. She comes home one day to find her husband dead, a sucide and finds her 9 yr old son Dylan in the closet after discovering his father. In comes Mark who says he is Ricards childhood friend and is a lawyer and offers to help Keely get Richards insurance and such in order. They fall in love and marry and have a child...but then tragedy strikes again when her second husband is also found dead. The DA who previously was engaged to marry Keely's second husband is out for revenge and tries to pin it on Dylan, Keely's brooding teenage son. Its a wild ride and keeps you on your toes. I enjoyed this book very much and read it in a day!I hope Patricia MacDonaly keeps them coming.... still a few I haven't read yet and today will run out and get them!"
3,Still deciding,"The product came quickly and unboxed like I was expecting. The container looked brand new but you could tell by the smell and the color of the product that it was old and maybe had been sitting on the shelf for quite some time. So far though it is working fine and feels very silky on my skin, just trying to adjust to the musty/older smell of it."
4,"Works, if you are somewhat crafty","This kit worked, but you need to be careful when cutting off the tabs that are for other vehicles. You could accidentally damage the other tabs. The storage bin that was originally with my factory stereo would not fit this kit without drilling new holes in the side of the bracket."
3,It works.,It comes in three pieces and is plastic. Made to fit various Kia models so you may need to break off certain clips that don't apply. But the instructions are clear.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I buy a lot of travel video. This was by far the worst I've ever seen. Just a few passes of the camera of an empty valley and 10 minutes of naration with horrible background music. Very, very poorly done, and deceitful in its description. What a let down! I could learn more by a simple internet inquiry of the region."
5,"If you want to pass, get this book.",I just passed my A+ OS test yesterday. This book covers everything you need to know. I own 5 different A+ books and this is the one that made the difference.
2,"Ok, but old","Good explanations of the basics, but ends with Win2K. Wish I had known, I would have bought a later edition."
2,Good for last year!!!,"If you're getting your A+ certificate now or recently, check out books that have been published more recently. This book is really good but it doesn't cover some of the revised curriculum that Comptia has started to practice in their new exams. Otherwise, awesome!!"
1,Couldn't Pass Exam with this book,"This is a great book for learning the technical trade. Unfortunately, I failed both of the exams studing this book. It has very little updated informtaion regarding the new Comptia A+ Adapive Certification Exams."
3,Could be more concise,"This book has all the information you need to pass the test, unfortunately it has a lot of information you don't need as well. I passed both the Core and OS exam in two consecutive days but I have computer experience. I would probably reccommend using a smaller, more concise study guide for novice/aspiring techs."
2,Not very technical,This book does not go into the real technical issues.If you're an advanced user and want to refresh then that's fine.
1,A+ certification all-in-one exam guide 4th edtion bunk,This book does not cover the new 2003 exam objectives and is therefore obsolute and worthless.
1,Bad Bad Bad!,You will fail the A+ exam if you study and go by the practice exams on the cd provided by this book! This book is a joke and should be intended for newbies to the profession. I want my money back Mike Myers!!
4,Check Edition!!!,Nice book for those who already know something about computers and want to get certified. Software that comes with it is somewhat buggy. Watch out for what edition you get. Most listings don't sat what edition. Latest one as of this writing is 4TH. 3RD edition doesn't cover Pentium 4 or Windows XP.
2,Too big for exam preperation,"This book was too for being advertised an exam prep book. It took me four weeks and i am only half way through. I forgot most of what I studied already. It would be more usefull if it were really updated for the new exams and condensed to meet today's hectic schedules.Thank you,"
5,only book for A+,"I read the book to help me pass my a+. i had no real previous knowledge of pc's b4 this book. as a total beginner, i read the book, studied and passed my A+. not only that i went from not knowing how to remove ram, to building my own pc from scratch and pc's for friends and fam. the A+ certification passport, also buy mike meyers is an ok book, but id stay away from it. anyways, this is the only book id recomend for the A+ exams. the acompanying software is top notch 2. id give it a 10 star rating if i could!"
5,Passed both exams...900 on Hardware Core,"What a great and clear explainations Michael gives in his book. This was the first McGraw book I purchased, but it was by far worth the experience. I felt extreamely confident on what would be on the test by using the enclosed CD-ROM. When I sat down for the test, I was not concerned...not that the test is that difficult. I referenced several direct quotes from his book on the test, which not only meant that the book was useful, but I actually learned the topics that I wasn't as comfortable with. It took me 20 minutes to take the Hardware Core and like I stated I got 900. The sidebar to this was that his OS section was a little weak. I don't have much experience with NT 4.0 or with Netware so I felt like I needed more information for those. Hopefully his next version will improve on that, but it was well worth the cost of the book."
3,Size larger than stated,"Material, style, and design is great. Plenty of pockets to satisfy most people. My gripe is the size. I have several Columbia long sleve shirts and wear a medium, however this style meduim was like a larger or bigger. The shirt was either labled wrong or they have poor manufacture control on this style."
5,Nice Shirt for Our African Safari,This shirt is lightweight and is quite smart-looking. It also has lots of pockets. We ended up buying two of these shirts for our trip to Africa later this year.
5,very good product,very good productProduct met expectations if the price is worth the payment .. are very good and been very satisfied.
5,Fits a little large,Fits a little big for a normal Xl but other than that awesome... Wore it in the rainforest of Belize to keep the bugs off... I wasn't excessively sweaty and bug free
3,Que puedo decir,"la talla es okla costura es okel diseño es okel color es otroEl color que figura en el sitio web no corresponde al color comprado, que lastima"
3,It's okay,"I got what I wanted! es loque queria me gusto la camisa, llego en tiempo el diseño no esta mal me gusto."
4,Stylish UV Protection,"I bought these for my husband. He works in a Florida State Park and he is outside all day in the sun. These shirts are lightweight, airy, and the sage color does not show dirt as quickly as the lighter colors. The only negative is that the buttons are not sewn on good enough, and you will probably have to sew one or two back on."
2,Disappointed in Quality,"As soon as I unpacked this shirt I was disappointed. The button holes are the worst I have ever seen. Many of the holes have stray threads which catch on the button and unravel when I unbuttoned the shirt. I have not had a chance to wear it yet but this is not an indication of a well made shirt. I also received another shirt (Sportif) also from Amazon and it appears to be much better made and the shirts are very similar in design. I will not be ordering any other products from Columbia.Update: Today I went to a local retail store and looked at their Columbia shirts. I looked at a lot of shirts and never found one loose thread. It makes me wonder if the shirt I received from this company is a 2nd, or worse yet counterfeit. All the shirts in the store looked to be of fine quality so I bought two more."
2,They SNAG on Everything,These shirts are beautiful until you wear them a few times. Each time you wear them they will snag on something until they look like you are wearing a berber rug with all the unsightly loops sticking out everywhere. Such a shame as I would have rated these shirts a 5 star were it not for this HUGE flaw.
4,Nice Shirt,"This is a nice shirt. It is very thin, so I wonder how well it will hold up. After careful examination, I've not found any defects in this shirts construction. I like the features and fit."
1,Columbia Men's Bahama II Long Sleeve Shirt,"Columbia Men's Bahama II Long Sleeve Shirt,The shirt is nice. did not fit me very well. The cost of returning it was going to be so much that I am pretty much stuck with it.will not be doing business with them again."
3,la camisa es inmensamente grande talla L,la talla L parece para una persona inmesamente grande quisa me equivoque por ser nueva queria una L tipo normal
5,Great Shirt for Fishing and outdoor sports.,Is a great all time. The color and texture are ok and fit OK as describe.please be careful and first see the size table for best fit.
4,Would Be Great Video if more of his songs were in Italian,First time I heard Eros was when I heard his duet with Tina Turner (Cose della Vita) - Brilliant I have since bought all of his Cd's. I think he excels in his duets especially Diffendero with Joe Cocker and Amarti E L'Immenso Per Me with Antonella Bucci. I have also seen him at a Concert in London - what a fantastic show and what a performer. If you've never seen him buy the video he's not to be missed.
2,POWER TOOL WILL NOT WORK ON WINDOWS XP,"After MANY frustrating attempts to install the power tool, I went to the Hasbro website and found out that you can ONLY play the game with the mouse if you have Windows XP...what a bummer this was to my six and four year old sons. They still have fun playing it with the mouse, but it is not their first choice.Thankfully, I ordered this when it was 50% off, or Tonka Joe would really be on my list!!"
1,No Support from Hasbro,The software works but the gun doesn't and there is no support from the Hasbro web site even though the manual says there is. The web site does not even mention this product. For leaving the customer in the dark they earn one star from me.
3,"Introduction to living, female hindu saints","A short and easy to read introduction to the situation of female hindu saints in general and to six ones in particular: Shree Maa, Anandamayi Ma, Anandi Ma, Swami Chidvilasananda, Ma Yoga Shakti and Ammachi. Five of the former are still alive and could, theoretically, be physically met. The nature of the book prevents the author from diving deeper into the lifes of these saints. But she recommends further reading with a list of books about individual of the above saints. (Three stars only, because it's somewhat superficial)."
2,What a waste,Betty's voice is still strong and beautiful but arrangements of most beloved songs are simply horrible.If you prefer traditional versions this concert is not for you.The quality of image and sound is very good.Can be recommended only to hardcore fans.
3,Betty at the Donmar,I love Betty Buckley and love hearing her sing. Unfornately this DVD offering does little to showcase a truly remarkable talent.
3,You might not be dumb as you think.,"For some of the material, I thought the book was o.k., but for others, it seemed a bit overly simplistic and difficult to find solutions for more complicated tasks. Does not include tips on Publisher, which was disappointing."
2,More like a reference! not for total newbies.,"Well.. I expected a practical guide which will help a newbie to get started with MS Office on practical usage. This book explains all options on each drop down menu in series. Welll.... I am not impressed.If you follow closely you might be able to find some menu options but not always used. For example, there is no point to know there are 4 ways to open a document for a new bie.Thats my opinion"
4,Visualy creative layout - needs more instructions,"In my ongoing quest for more info on the how-tos of creating my Heritage Scrapbook, I purchased CHS. It is much better than Bev K Braun's book - CHS provides many intersting lay-outs which has given me wonderful ideas. But thank goodness I don't want to exactly replicate them because very few step-by-step instructions are offered.Overall, I would recommend this book as a basic in your library."
5,Kevin Bacon is it!,"Not only is Kevin Bacon our best and most under-rated actor, he is a very talented and entertaining musician. The band has a great tight sound, the tracks are fun, I was impressed, as I always am by Mr. Bacon, buy it, it is a blast."
4,One of My Favorites,This CD has become one of my favorites. The faster songs are catchy and fun to sing along with and the slower numbers are very pretty (especially Adirondack Blue). My only complaint is that I've listened to it so much the lyrics are starting to bounce around in my brain day and night.
5,loved it,"when i was first introduced to this cd i could not believe that kevin bacon could turn out a cd. after listening to the cd i was amazed at the quality songs that kevin and his brother came up with. this is a excellent cd to buy. i also saw the the bacon brothers in concert at the planet hollywood in myrtle beach s.c. what an amazing show. i highly recommend seeing them in concert if given the chance. if you have not bought this cd buy it now. their new cd ""getting there"" is also a wonderful cd."
2,Bacon Brothers CD,"I was disappointed in this CD. Everyone has their taste so I'll leave it to the other fans of Kevin Bacon to enjoy this one. In the future perhaps this band will record a CD that really gets me into the funk I really expected per the hype. I still think this man, with his long career, REALLY cool wife and family are special."
5,Amazing CD - these guys will blow your socks off!,"Like most people, I was surprised that Kevin Bacon was taking a stab at a musical career. They recently performed in Portsmouth, NH, so we got tickets for the show, and bought the album to see what we were in for. I can't even describe how fabulous their music is! Kevin and Michael have written beautiful, poignant, funny and even some really rockin' tunes that will have you addicted in just one listen. Their style stretches over the boundaries of rock, folk, country and soul. Their voices blend beautifully together, and their harmony is fantastic. And their show was out of this world. I recommend this CD to anyone with an open mind and a thirst for good music! And if 'Brown Eyes' written by Kevin about his wife & kids doesn't bring a tear to your eye, nothing will!"
2,Don't waste your money....,"Not a very good movie. If you like a tacky ""B"" rated movie then get if not then don't waste your money. Cover looks good but that is about it. The story line if boring at best and if you are looking for great action then this is not the movie to get. Would recommend you spend your money on something else. After watching this I gave it away."
2,the all time worst,"I wish someone would have let me know how terrible this movie was so I wouldn't have thrown my money away. This has to be the worst movie of all time, how anybody could have made such a crappy movie to begin with is beyond my belief."
1,How do you say Ccrrraaaaaaaaappp in Japanese!,"Those looking for a film similar to Machine Girl or Tokyo Gore Police will be disappointed. There is very little hot gore action and the film is slow moving with little plot or dialogue to keep your attention. Too many long endless scenes of wandering in the woods and encountering foolish foes!! Jeez, why bother going to all this work and not notch it up in a few places!! File on the dung heap of wasted money and time!! The lead actress is very nice to look at, though that ain't worth the price of admission. Avoid this one."
5,I love this book,"I learned so much history from this book, as well as remembered previously learned stories from the bible. This book, and entire series, is enlightening and movtivational. It is brilliant in is uses of bibilical stories and scripture to create fiction that inspires one's life today. I haven't read such a good series in a long time."
4,Really good but.....,The story aspect was really interesting. Shafer did a great job on the bible stories. What I didn't like too much was how Lucifer was protrayed as innocently and it was his demons who did all the dirty work in everything. Also there was a lot of repeating between arguments with angels and demons. It became very very repetative. Overall I like the series so far and will finish the complete series for sure. I hope everyone reads the story and feels that much closer to our Saviour.If you enjoy this type of story you must read Chronicles of Brothers by Wendy Alec. Awesome series! The only bad thing though is its not offered on Kindle. But I'm serious i cannot say enough wonderful things about the entire series please everyone check it out. I read somewhere that the author is in the process of making a movie based on her creative story. Can't wait!
2,"Good Wipe, Bad Smell","I loved how well this wipe worked, but it smells so aweful! We ended up throwing away the wipes because they made me sick to my stomach everytime we changed our boys! If Pampers would change the sent, I'd really like these wipes!"
3,Eh. Definitely not worth the extra $$.,"I don't perceive any noticeable difference between these and regular pampers wipes, certainly nothing significant enough to justify the price difference. Plus they have an odd, fruity scent which doesn't go very well with hiney cleaning. Can't get excited."
3,Not worth the money,"The extra thickness is barely noticeable and the scent is unappealing, it gave me a headache using the product once."
3,Lion Heart,"I've always wanted to sail around the world ever since Robin Lee Graham did it in 1965. All though, I never did this movie comes close to what I always dreamed. The freedom to get on a boat and sail away; but I was disappointed that he never stops to enjoy the world he just sailed."
5,Good story,It's a true story that enspiered me the most he is a gutsy kid with big dreams and a big hart
1,"Really, really, bad","I feel bad for my wife for making her watch this movie. I was very excited to see it, but after 5 minutes I knew this purchase was a mistake. The entire movie is about how he is bored, tired, and hungry."
2,A little disappointed,"I found the film to be long on interviews about Jesse Martin and short on the actual sailing of the craft, though there were at times some fine shots of the dolphins accompanying Jesse on this adventure."
5,A New Respect for Language Studies,"Having never been introduced to the study of languages, I was amazed at the detail that this author put into her work. As a novice, I was enthralled at the intricaces in which a language diciphered and broken apart. Every language has a history and this book has broken down Modern Arabic with a writing style and organization that is truley academic. A monumental achievement."
2,Not Bay Rhum,"The cologne does not smell like classic Bay Rhum - it is some other kind of cologne. The soap doesn't really smell like bay rhum either. If you really like the Bay Rhum smell, don't even bother buying this."
4,Love this game,"Our 5 y-o twins got this for Christmas, and we just love it. My 3 y-o plays along too, and the pace is right for them. They enjoy cheering for the characters they need to complete bingo, and watching the 'wild' segments. I've purchased this for several kids birthdays at the 5 y-o range."
5,Super Fun!!,A friend let me borrow this game for my three year old granddaughter. I was a little concerned she wasn't old enough but she LOVES the game! So much so that I've ordered one for her to keep. Definitely recommend for families with children of all ages (My husband likes the game at least as much as our granddaughter does!)
1,Dont waste your time on this book,"Don't waste your time buying this book. The 1st page is a printing statement that says "" Due to the very old age of this book many pages may be hard to read or missing.This book was written a very long time ago and has nothing to do with life insurance these days.THis book is really bad, and would make you laugh looking at it. They put an old book in a new book cover."
4,Fun online game-webkinz for horses!,"My daughter loves horses! She saw these cards while at a horse camp and had to have some. The idea behind them is, you get trading cards with pictures and information on imaginary horses- when you get home, you can log into the Bella Sara site and ""your"" horse comes alive.It is a hit with my kids."
4,Depression causes and understanding,"This video provides the rudimentary physiological underpinnings of the depression disease and simply but elaborately gives the viewer a true sense of understanding of the subject matter. Objective information is elaborately portrayed and neurological pathways and activities are clearly explained. An understanding of depression and its effects are presented from an informative, humanistic viewpoint. The viewer is able to comprehend how depression works and the effects of this disease on the everyday individual. A well rounded understanding of depression is conveyed through this impressive medium. Well done, ABC news!"
2,Not Worth the Read,"I wanted to like this book. I really did. Unfortunately, I just couldn't. The plot was sufficiently interesting, but the writing was weak, and the dialogue was poorly done."
2,Could have been much better,"I haven't read Lawhead's other works, but this was a big disappointment. The characters were shallow, the villains incompetent, the Protestant Christian symbolism too blunt, and the spelling and grammar atrocious. Whoever the editor was should be fired. The only redeeming aspect was a fairly original plot, but it is not enough to save the rest of the book."
2,Uninspiring Christian Fantasy,"As an avid fantasy lover and non-Christian, I found this book very disappointing. The plot is unoriginal, the characters uninspiring, and I felt cheated by the none-too-subtle religious propoganda -- I realized only after reading the book that the publishing company is all Christian literature. If you're looking for Christian fantasy -- hey, it's a limited genre, and this book isn't all bad. But if you're just looking for good fantasy -- look elsewhere."
2,Yet more 'feel-good' pseudo-Christian writings...,"Oh please, when will it end? 'The One Most High will save me..."" etc etc. If someone is going to write a rekigious novel based around one all mighty deity/religious institution, then they could at least make it a little stronger, with some three dimensional characters, like the Dark Sword trilogy by Weis/Hickman."
1,No instructional value,This product contains very little information on actually kingfishing!! It is of poor quality and the man hosting who is advertised as an expert has next to no clue of what he is doing. This is basically a video of his charter trip in the early 90's. There is no technical rigging of tackle of any sort. As a commercial king fisherman I would not recommend this video to anyone but a class room full 3rd grade boys.
1,Dont buy Pentax,The clip that holds the battery in the camera broke and makes the cameraunusable. Pentax wants $94.00 to repair it.Do not buy Pentax because of their carless design and construction.
1,Pentax junk,"First camera DOA, lens extended on power up and the camera locked up. Have to pop battery out to reset.Sent back, 2nd camera worked about 3 months and then the famous date-time resets everytimg you power off. Very common read dpreview.Got it fixed under warranty (PCB repair) and 6 months later the problem reappeared.Picture quality good though very contrasty and oversharpened. Divx video is horrific. LCD near impossible to see in daylight. Battery life non-existent"
3,Nice Camera :),"My husband bought me this camera about 2 years ago for my birthday, and now again that my birthday is approaching in 6 days, my husband purchased me the new Pentax 70x. I loved this camera when I first got it, however after a year of having it, no drops or any misuse. The lense wouldnt shut properly, and the pictures are always blurry. Its like you have to wait for the camera to adjust whenever you need to take a picture, and take multiple pictures until it does. Also, the camera will turn on and the lense will go out, and then turn itself off right away even with a fully charged battery. I love Pentax products, I have used their cameras all my life and my husband has a scope for his rifle made by them. For some reason this camera is just iffy after a year of use. I also find that it is very pricey on Amazon.com. Much cheaper on QVC and you get a kit full of extras."
3,"Optio A30 id good , but .....","I am not able to set date on pictures taken. In Nikon, Olympus I was able to do this. After a a year or two when you have 1000 pics on a hard disk, DVD or CD, you will not be able to tell which picture was taken when.This is a real BIG fault in this camera.Pls correct me if I am wrong. Waiting for reply."
3,I had to buy this book for a class,"So, it wasn't exactly an ""optional"" purchase. It's a little dry, like a text book usually is. But information is overall good."
5,"Very good, plus...","This is a very good book. In addition to this, I recommend ""Strategic Organizational Change"" by Michael Beitler."
5,Definently a players racquet,Before I purchased this racquet I played with the Prince TT Warrior OS. After demoing this racquet I feel in love with it. It doesn't have a lot of power or swingweight so it's good for anyone looking to purchase a tweener or players racquet. It provides great spin with the light swingweight. After a while of playing with it though I added about 3 grams of lead tape to add a little more power. It now feels great. I suggest using a polyester string with this racquet though. Syn gut didn't seem to have much feel to it.
1,Excelent product,"It has an excellent cost benefit ratio, mixing control and precision.I am very glad with this product."
3,No Modifications for Pregnancy,"I have to say I am very surprised by the overwhelming positive response to this workout listed on this site. I found there to be absolutely no modifications in this ""Pregnancy"" workout than in any other Pilates workouts. I was very uncomfortable with all the positions lying on your back, and I was advise to not do this workout past the first trimester. I had been doing Mari Windsors Pilates routine prior to pregancy and it's almost the exact same routine with no changes for the pregnant body. I was very disappointed and would not recommend this video for a PREGNANT woman."
2,Disappointed,"I have done both pilates and yoga prepregnancy and I wanted to keep this up through my pregnancy. This video is a good pilates video for a woman that isn't pregnant, but it contains many exercises that a pregnant woman shouldn't do after the first trimester. I have been told by a number of sources, including my doctor, that you should eliminate exercises that are performed while flat on your back or while you're standing in one place for long periods, as both can reduce blood flow to the fetus. A lot of this video is done while lying flat on your back. Don't waste your money on this video if you have others, just continue with the others and skip the exercises that are done while laying flat on your back."
4,"This is pretty good, but not much different from my others.","I own quite a few non-pregnancy Pilates DVDs. I really don't see much difference between this one and my other DVDs. She does give a few modifications, but most of it is the same moves. I'm not finding it to be uncomfortable (unless you count all of the times that I lay down and then sit up on the next pose...) really. I probably didn't need this based on what I already had, but I really wasn't sure in advance if the moves were safe for pregnancy. I would recommend it, but NOT if you already have other Pilates tapes."
2,not that great,This was overall not that great. I found the instructor to be boring and cannot imagine doing a lot of the moves at the end of my pregnancy. I am much happier with my Fitmama DVD.
2,Choose a different Pilates DVD,"I agree with the others. Although Melinda claims you can do this workout throught your pregnancy, the majority of this workout is done on your back. According to ACOG, we should avoid exercising on your back starting at 20 weeks. Also, she doesn't count through some of the moves - especially frunstrating when some of the moves require you to be looking at the floor in order to be in neutral spine. The majority of the moves are similar to Windsor Pilates so if you already own Windsor, avoid this one and look for another pre-natal pilates DVD. I'll be checking out the newer Pilates in Pregnancy."
4,Not all that bad,"I had the opposite experience from a number of other reviewers - the Method's Prenatal Yoga made me nauseated every time I tried it (and I haven't had all that much trouble with morning sickness in general). This one, on the other hand, energized and strengthened me. There are a number of back exercises, true. I didn't have trouble with them, but I can see how others might. I am nearly 8 months and have combined this with a brisk waddle a few times a week to keep fit. Of course, always follow the advice of your doctors."
1,"nice set, nice instructor, not so nice of a workout","the video had potential, but it does not compare to the type of workout I can get at my health club. There, I know the teacher can correct me if I do somehting wrong, and this video tends to put me in positions that do not seem safe or what my doctor would recommend. I'm a little afraid to do it again, as the routine was not what I need to do with a baby in my belly."
5,A must have...,A must have video. Really informative and extensive in its workout. I have bought 4 more copies to give as gifts to friends. Enjoy.
1,blah,"blah, bored after doing this video, so bored i don't have much to say other than blah, this prenatal workout is blah blah blah, a bunch of hot air and more hot air, blah"
1,Just asked my doctor,I bought this tape and was surprised to find that the majority of it took place while lying on one's back. I asked my doctor (this was in Spetember 2004) and she said I should DEFINITELY not use it. So I don't. What a waste of money.
1,Boring video - can't use past the 1st trimester,"I waited in anticipation for this video. Got it and was thoroughly disappointed. You can't perform 95% of the exercises after the 3rd month of pregnancy as she begins each of them by instructing you to get on your back.(What was she thinking?) The exercises also appeared to be simply fruitless. But of course how would I know, I didn't perform any of the exercises. I just watched her and wondered, ""Now how in the world is that supposed to keep anybody firm?"" I simply put the tape in during my 5th month of pregnancy and felt totally taken advantage of for even spending the money."
1,"do not lay on your back during this workout, it's not safe","I don't care what this instructor is saying from Hollywood, I've spoken with 7 different doctors who do not agree with her workout philosphy, this workout is not safe for pregnant women. It is a good workout, but it is not safe, thus it can't be effective."
3,Takes getting used to...,"I purchased this DVD at the same time I bought ""Fit Mama"" and was, at first, a bit disappointed in the Pilates workout. I agree with the other reviewer about the instructor - she is a bit dry, especially when comparing her to Leisa Hart (who I strongly recommend!) With that said, I decided to give this DVD another shot and, once I knew what to expect, I found it to be a fine addition to my prenatal work-out regime. This is my first time doing Pilates and, after getting used to concentrating on those core abdominal muscles, I feel that the DVD will be helpful during the pregnancy."
3,Pretty good tape,"I found this tape to be a pretty good overall workout. It doesn't feel like you are getting anywhere because it is more like an infomative lesson. I will continue to use it just because some of the excersizes seem to be beneficial. It doesn't have a smooth routine feeling though. It's like they just thought of some moves and made a demo tape. Also, it takes a minute to see the modified poses and she is halfway done with the pose by the time the modified poses come on the screen."
3,Not what I was looking for,"When I bought this DVD, I already owned a couple of pilates DVDs I was quite happy with, but I wanted one that was already modified for pregnant women. Specifically, I wanted exercises done while not lying flat on my back. I was disappointed that this DVD showed most of the exercises done flat on the back and only briefly mentioned modifications if that was uncomfortable. I could have just used the DVDs I already owned! I gave it 3 stars since it was an ok pilates DVD, just not what I had in mind when I bought it."
2,Same as others,"I wish I read the review before buying it, but well, I'll wait until the baby's born to use it. I'm afraid to contract my abdominal muscles on every single exercise (wich you contract either want it or not)."
5,Great workout!,"I used this DVD to ease myself back into pilates after a rough first trimester of morning sickness - this was just what I needed! A fan of yoga and pilates pre-pregnancy, I needed a way to get back into mind-body workouts but was not sure what exercises I could do, and did not want to spend money on costly classes. The guidance and modifications offered made me feel comfortable with the exercises I was doing and I am enjoying the benefits of the workouts - energy, increased flexibility, and tone in my arms and legs! It is inspiring to see how great the pregnant instructor looks at 30 weeks... I will continue to used this DVD through the rest of my pregnancy and after!"
1,This should not be marketed as a Pregnancy workout,"I am very familiar with Pilates, also a dance instructor and was anxious to try this dvd when I became pregnant with my 2nd child. I was very disappointed not only that the instructor did not appear to be pregnant, she seemed to have zero knowledge of fitness safety or modifications for someone who is pregnant. It is very dangerous and hopefully common knowledge that at any stage but especially in your 2nd and 3rd trimester to lie flat on your back. Basically the first 15 minutes of the workout is spent laying flat on your back. It is a danger to pregnant women and they should discontinue the sales of this workout."
3,Good workout but question a few things,"These are GREAT Pilates exercises as I've become a Pilates addict over the past year. However, I found it very disturbing that the woman on the cover was NOT pregnant in the video, and didn't seem to give any special techniques if you felt any kind of pain or what not on an exercise. It would be much more comforting to see a PREGNANT woman doing these exercises with me. I'm almost nervous that I might be doing things that I should NOT be doing. Overall, though, the exercises are great and I plan to definitely use the tape after my baby is born."
1,Unsafe and Awful!,"This is one of the worst exercise videos/dvd's I have ever used. The instructor is completely flat in personality. They show her advanced in pregnancy, so you think you could do the video the entire pregnancy, but in reality, she is very early in her pregnancy and barely showing. All of the moves should only be done in the first trimester. Practically all of the moves are done flat on the back, which is unsafe!Save your money!"
1,check with your doctor before doing this tape,"I found this video to be totally against the grain, my obgyn does not like it and disagrees with the instructor on many points, pilates is good bu other workouts are better than this."
1,Entire video you will be flat on your back,The entire video is about exercises laying flat on your back which doesn't make sense to me at all. I am very disappointed that the modifications are useless too.(You are still asked to stay on your back.) I would not recommend this video to anybody.
3,It was great until week 28,"I've been doing this DVD for several of months and have really been enjoying it...there's good focus on form and the slower pace has also allowed my inflexible husband to participate in my prenatal work out. Unfortunately, there just aren't enough modifications for my growing belly. A good chunk of the video is on your back and now that I'm into my seventh month I just can't do it anymore. In addition, my growing belly gets in the way more and more. So this is a great video for early and mid pregnancy...especially for women who may just be starting Pilates or have been out of practice for a bit...but it's really not for 3rd trimester."
2,Good for first trimester only.,"I like the DVD, but it has a lot of moves you need to do on your back, which you're not suppposed to do after the first trimester. I found this disappointing b/c I want to continue to do Pilates througout my pregnancy."
1,Boring from the Start...,"I bought this DVD at my local book store a week ago. I'm only 8 weeks pregnant and wanted to start pilates again to keep in shape. From the very beginning this is a snoozer! I'm no expert in pilates, and do not mind an instructor taking her/his time to explain postures, but Melinda Bryan is very slow in her instruction and you can actually see that she's reading off of cue cards! I find it very distracting. Each pilates exercise is also broken into individual segments- it has no flow from one posture to another. I actually had to turn it off before it finished. If you still would like to purchase this DVD, make sure you can return it for a refund or exchange. I made the mistake of buying it from a bookstore where I couldn't do this. Now I'm out $16 and have a DVD I'll never use again..."
2,Just too boring,Have not tried Pilates before. Tried three times to get through this video and kept getting annoyed by the lengthy explanations that preceded each exercise. Just could not get into this one.
4,AN EXCELLENT FOLLOWUP IN THE RUNE SERIES!,"The first novel in the Rune series was ""Manhattan is My Beat,"" and I didn't care for that novel very much. But ""Death Of A Blue Movie Star"" was ten times better. Rune is now a production director's assistant. She gets in the middle of bombings of movie theaters and production companies. Rune's new friend dies in one of the bombings. Can Rune stop the bombings and discover who killed her friend before she dies herself? Trust me, it's worth the money. The third and final Rune novel comes out in late January/ early February, and it's called ""Hard News!"""
2,death of a blue movie star,was not up to jeffrey deavers standard. i am a big fan of his and was disappointed with this rune trilogy.
4,"quirky, funny","Death of a Blue Movie Star is the second book in Jeffrey Deaver's Rune series. Rune is living on a houseboat and working at becoming a film-maker. Following bomb attacks on adult theatres and studios, she decides to make a documentary about the life of a blue movie star. As usual, she gets involved in far more than she intends, including porn stars, the NYPD bomb squad, religious fanatics and leathergoods ads. Rune's naiveté is truly entertaining. With an excellent plot twist at the end, this a great read"
2,Slow - Not up to Deaver's standards,"Lots of 'fluff' to make the book have pages. Language is xrated. I have read just about every Deaver book, and this is the first one that I have ever written a review on. I am doing this because of my disappointment in the book. It does not read like a 'Deaver' creation. CJ"
5,Wish there were more,"The whole family really enjoys this dvd. Fun stories and songs that I don't mind listening to over and over and over and over. This is currently the two year olds favorite, and the 4 and 5 year old enjoy it as well. Really hope there are more to come."
5,My New Favorite Movie,"I remember reading the Frances books during my preschool-early second grade years, so I was excited to see this movie was available on streaming through Nexflix. I'm happy to say that I'm very impressed. The plot is enhanced through dialogue and catchy songs to classical tunes. This is great for any age.Overall Rating: IN for ages 2 and up and 10/10"

4,Ceramic Frogs,"Before this, I had only read ""The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau Banks"" by the same author, and I really enjoyed it. When I started reading these, I was immediately pulled in (and I am not normally a chic lit person) and Ruby was so real it was amazing, she was quirky and hilarious in an overanalyzing way. She wasn't one of those characters who is so perfect it is almost painful to read about her, no, she had many flaws but they were realistic ones. Her voice was original and hilarious and very refreshing and none of her victories came easily. This is definitely one of the chic lit books worth buying!"
1,not worth it,"This book was a HUGE disappointment. After reading the whole thing, I felt robbed of a good hour and a half of my life. The plot was pathetic, Ruby was an idiot, and the story never went anywhere. If there was a ever a book that should be burned-you really shouldn't burn books- it would be this one, hands down."
4,The Boyfriend List,"This book is about a girl who's been having some panic attacks. Her therapist recommends making a list of anyone she's had anything with. While this does help her realize her problems it also gives her many many more. Because nobody sane throws away something you don't want read in a public school trash can.Word spreads about the list and she loses all sanity, including her friends due to her ex being a butthead and cheating on her best friend, a guy she thought was her friend going wacko over a kiss on her other friends cheek, and her other friend being jealous for being stood up. Not to mention her ex throwing a fit cause she's hanging around these other two guys.Personally, I'm a little young for who this was originally recommended for but I liked it well enough. It is hilariously funny and if you ever need a pity book this would go well."
4,The boyfriend list,I am glad I purchased this online. I saved money. It was a good price and came quick. All around good experience!
2,"Very Bland, Very Boring","This book was so boring I couldn't even finish. The book was nothing more than the character ""Roo"" ranting about her miserable pathetic teen life on her boat and at her school. And those footnotes!!!!!!!!!! That was terribly annoying!!!!!!!! This book is definitely not one I would treasure!"
4,an exceptional addition to YA literature,"An engaging narrative, well-meaning but amusingly imperfect parents who are a strong presence in the book, and authentic dialogue and reactions separate this book from the majority of books marketed to teenage girls these days. What I liked best about this book is the acknowledgement that people with whom we have had even glancing interaction can have a lasting impact. Ruby's ""boyfriend list"" only contains a couple of actual boyfriends, but the rest certainly deserve their place on the list since it is a really a list of boys who have had an effect on her and her sense of herself. A fast, emotionally-involving read that leaves the reader with plenty to think about and talk about."
3,Not the Most Interesting Book in the World.,"This book was kind of boring because I am not really interested in these kind of books. The synopsis of the book sounds interesting but I was kind of disappointed with the turn out of the book. I am not saying it is a bad book though because it's not. In the beginning Ruby Oliver, who is 15, starts by telling you about how her parents always think the wrong idea when Ruby looks sad or doesn't feel good. Then her parents send her to a shrink named Dr.Z to get help. Dr.Z. tells her to make a list (the boyfriend list) of all the boys she liked, ""dated"", or boys she met. Then she tells you about 15 of them. Will she understand herself more or will she feel even guiltier? Will her confidence increase so she can actually face her school and not be known as a ""leper""? You'll just have to read it and find out."
4,mixed emotions,"the book is quite interesting but a little complicated if you stop reading for a week (as i did because i had finals). a very insecure girl who had everything bad happen to her, but then learns from it and ends up being a decent book. easy read. will read sequel."
4,A good look into the mind of a teenage girl,"E. Lockhart's THE BOYFRIEND LIST is a cute, funny book that takes readers into the mind of a teenage girl.Ruby Oliver isn't having a very good time in high school. Her boyfriend dumped her, her best friends aren't talking to her anymore, and she keeps having these random panic attacks. Her parents decide to send her to a therapist,and that's where the ""boyfriend list"" comes into play. Ruby is instructed to make a list of all the boys she's ever had crushes on, dated, or maybe dated. While making the boyfriend list, Ruby learns a lot about herself and the person who she is becoming.THE BOYFRIEND LIST is a fun, quick read. Teenage girls will be able to relate to a lot of the situations that Ruby finds herself in, and its a nice look into the mind of a sarcastic, intelligent, confused high school student."
5,great teen voice,"Ruby Oliver has to start seeing a shrink at age 15 after the worst 10 days of her life. She did something ""suspicious"" with a boy, lost all her friends, and all her semi-friends, became a social outcast, and had a panic attack. After the panic attack, Ruby's mom starts making her go see Dr. Z. Dr. Z in turn forces Ruby to make a list of all her boyfriends, almost-boyfriends, could-have-been-boyfriends, and wanted-to-be-boyfriends. At first the therapy sessions are cathartic and Ruby is working out her problems, even if the other kids at school are still avoiding her. Then her ""Boyfriend List"" gets discovered, and suddenly people think she's an über-slut, even though some of the boys are from second grade. Will Ruby ever gain back her reputation, and her friends? Ruby's voice is incredibly real, and the pain she goes through is easily identifiable as realistic high school drama. And the footnotes sprinkled throughout help, as well."
5,A book everyone should have,"After reading many books of this nature, I found this book to have incredible insight. It's simple, true and very powerful for anyone interested in positive change for themselves, their families, their relationships and their communities. You'll want to share this book with people you care about!"
5,Great book,This book is an easy read. It helps to motivate you to achieve your best. I love the fact that it uses some common (well Known) spiritual references.
4,Great Album (of course),"What people have come to expect from Andy C (founder of Ram Records) - great mixes. Andy C includes all of the essential tracks of 2003 and early 2004 from the heaviest and most well-known DJ's in the UK drum and bass universe.However, you probably have heard half of this tracks on others mixes. But Andy C's placement of tracks is superb and the tracks go in a logical order.Also, he has 27 tracks on the album. So if you are looking for the essential d-n-b tracks of 2003 this is your album."
4,Great mix,"Andy c has come again with a great cd. this cd is well mix as well pick in tracks, in overall great drum n bass mix, 1 mistake on 16-17 tracks, the mixing was poorly done there but the whole cd is good"
3,It's okay,I bought this 3 pack for my preschool class. My older students were able to use it without too much difficulty but it didn't hold their attention for long. There is not much educational value to the games but they enjoyed them for a little while.
5,OLDER AN STILL PLAYING BACKYARDKIDS,WHEN I STARTED PLAYING BACKYARDKIDS GAMES. IT COST ME $19.00 NOW I FOUND A THREE PACK.I'M 12 YEARS OLD AND HAVE BOUGHT LOT OF GOOD STUFF.
2,"Interesting, but not helpful....","This book was interesting, but not particularly helpful in terms of information. I sincerely hope the caregiver has stopped smoking since this is one of the number one causes of stroke and I can't imagine smoking around a stroke victim. The degree of care provided to the stroke victim by the author is interesing as it certainly did not impress me as what would be provided by someone in a true caretaker role--no mention of attending PT sessions, meeting with physicians, etc. Also no real information on what was helpful and what wasn't in terms of care. There's a big deal made about the link between the author's experience in advertising and her ability to motivate/inspire the victim, but this was not evident to me at all in the actual text of the book."
4,Warm and well described,"This is a good book about the before, during and after of a drama like brain injuries. The author explains how lonely is the care-taker and how overwhelming is the task. I am in a similare situation as my husband had a stroke at the young age of 46 and I found support and understanding through the pages of this book.All the aspects are approached like the difficulties, the fears, the financial aspects etc.... a well as the hope, the happiness related to each achievement, the ups and downs and the faith into a future, different from the past but still worth fighting for life.A must read"
3,"Uplifting read, but very general","This was an enjoyable book to read (considering the topic), but it didn't offer much in the way of specifics for care giving or rehabilitation. Much of the book is dedicated to telling the author's story, and it also heavily references the 12 step program. Although I didn't get the specifics I was looking for, I did get a few ideas for additional research, such as eye exercises for regaining balance. Additionally, the book did provide me with a sense of hopeful optimism about my care giving situation."
2,Mistitled,This is a long exposition in the self congratulation of a caregiver for her participation in the partial stroke recovery of a housemate. Its description of the processes of improvement are clear but not how they were effected in the patient. A promising title unfulfilled.
4,Another Sala Page Turner,"This is a nice short read. It's a Silhouette, so it's somewhat vanilla in violence and romance scenes, but it's a Sala, so IMO that makes it worthwhile.SYNOPSIS:Detective has a mini-breakdown after the murder of his partner. He has a chance encounter with a woman out in the country, which leads to him helping the town's only cop solve a mystery about who kidnaped and tortured the town's rich banker.The detective also finds the love he never had or believed in as he gets to know the country lady.You'll never go wrong with a Sala."
4,Uplifting help when faith is challenged,"If you have ever bought a book that offers self-help, then closed it in disgust because its ""advice"" was too abstract to apply or the author seemed too pompous to relate to, The 911 Handbook should delight you. Pastor Kent Crockett, a naturally up-beat personality who is also grounded in the same world you and I are, offers useful, easily-grasped tips on how to deal with life circumstances such as financial problems, doubt, guilt, anger at yourself or others, depression, and more. You won't find a cliche in the book: his illustrations are fresh, relevant, and often funny. The book lives up to its title, offering believers fast relief"
5,Great for new Christians and the Disillusioned,"I found this book by chance one day in my local bookstore. It is an awesome encouraging, view-changing book! It is very easy to read. Kent uses allusions to the bible and to everyday examples to prove his points. It discusses such topics as:Burn OutFear Of DeathFaithDepressionForgivenessCriticismand many others....It opens your eyes to the way God views these issues, rather than the way the world views them. I was disillusioned for too long, this book was truly a life changer for me.**In addition, last Saturday night I went to his website and wrote a ""comment to Kent Crockett"" thinking it would go to a secretary and generate an automated response. To my great surprise he wrote back a personal email within an hour!! He seems to be a man of great character and truly down to earth.I highly reccommend his books to any new christians, or those who like me had become disillusioned with life."
5,Easy to understand!!!,"This book is awesome. It has a chapter, it seems, for every problem area in my life and a Biblical solution to those problems in easy to understand terms. Informative and witty, this book has been a pleasure to read."
5,"I wasn't expecting it to be that good, it's great!","I thought that this book was just another ""skim over the top"" book of Windows programming. I was wrong. It has a lot of information that any programmer at any level can use. Well worth the money."
1,don't buy this book.,"book. The author asked the readers to compile all the codes with MS visual c++ latest version. But my MS visual c++ 6 does not compile any of the codes. The error information I got is that no main() fucntion is found.The author does not offer any instruction on how to set up the compiler to work with all the codes. In this way, this book is useless, since I can not know the effect those codes could produce.If I am veteran in window programming, I don't need any instruction on how to set up the compiler to compile those codes. if this is the case, I even don't need this book.However, I am new beginner in windows programming, that's why I bought this book, and want to learn. But this book did not tell you how to start with all those stupid codes, then, you have nothing to learn.my opnion: don't buy this book. If by accident you bought this book, throw it in fire."
4,A good book for beginners.,"You will find the basics of writing an application and much more within the folds of this book. By explaining and demonstrating the most-used windows API calls, this book provides the novice Windows programmer with a firm foundation from which to build an applications. You will find the basics of writing an application and much more within the folds of this book. There's also plenty of example C source code provided for showing you how it's put together. If you have experience programming in C/C++, but you are new to writing Windows 95/98 programs, I recommend this book to you. It's a great place to start. Eric Davis"
2,Better books available,"This is a good book for introducing someone to windows programming, but I would suggest ""Programming Windows"" fifth edition by Charles Petzold as it is a more complete book. This book only describes how to use controls in a dialog box. No information is provided for using controls in a window, except for scroll bars and even then not scroll bar controls. If not for this I would give this book a 4 out of 5."
5,Great for Windows beginners,"This book is a great way to learn Windows programming with Win32. Although the book is written for Windows 98, it clearly highlights differences with Windows 95, and even Windows 3.x. Schlidt's expert knowledge is evident, his writing style is pleasant and easy to read, and he includes extensive sample code to illustrate each feature he discusses. I highly recommend it."
5,Holistic Mental Health Care Overview,"This is an excellent compedium of integrative and holistic therapies, not just for mental health. The editor, Scott Shannon, MD, is a holistic child psychiatrist from Fort Collins, Colorado, who is the current president of the Americal Holistic Medical Association. His three chapters provide an excellent foundation for a holistic approach to all mental health problems. Knowledge needs to be applied with Wisdom. Psychiatric medications should be combined not only with psychotherapy or counselling, but also an individual plan of personal and spiritual growth. The carefully chosen contributors to this text are all experts in their field, ranging from acupuncture to art and music therapy. The practical information provided is useful for patients and clinicians alike. This groundbreaking text should become a standard reference for any mental health care professional. It is well written, and a pleasurable read. Kudos to Dr. Shannon!"
3,Beautiful Garden Photos,"This book is more of a coffee table kind of book. The photos are beautiful, but I wish there were more descriptors, more info on the plantings themselves."
5,"sexy, beautiful , and talented",i love this dvd. i think Layla is very talented and beautiful. she is very sweet and teaches all the best moves. it's a hard workout so you will be sweating. i would suggest this dvd to anyone who wants to learn and fun with belly dancing. i can't wait for her to put out more.
3,disappointing,"The only reason I didn't give this a lower review, was because of the nostalgia I have for the movie. Overall I was disappointed with the experience with this seller. The condition was not ""very good"", it was faded and worn out pretty badly (which it is an old movie, but it should be labeled as such). The time quoted was 3-5 days, it took almost 2 weeks. I still haven't watched it, but I'm crossing my fingers that the ""very good"" is referring to how the movie plays."
1,...,i'm sorry...i absolutely love mdb but i couldn't believe this. i have nothing against a band evolving..changing as they feel fit. i saw this cd in the store..bought it because it was my dying bride...when i got home my dissapointment was immediate and even if my life depended on it i couldn't like this cd.
2,A disappointment,"My Dying Bride are by far one of the best doom metal bands, however their latest recording lacked all that made them what they are. I must admit that I was upset with the leaving of Martin but this is a band than can over come such obstacles. They proved me right with their first couple songs and the last track was somewhat memorable, but I do not know what happened in between. I believe the song Heroin Chic is an all time low for this band. I was hoping for another ""Like Gods of the Sun"" or even another epic like ""The Angel and the Dark River"". Regardless of this release, I will continue to be a fan."
2,...sorrowful...,"I have to admit this is the most depressing MDB album to date! Listening to this cd fills my soul with a true sense of doom...of course I dont mean that in a good way. I really hate to hop on the band wagon, but this album hurts. maybe if it wasnt a MDB album I wouldnt judge it so harshly, but I almost feel betrayed. It would be like being married to Cindy Crawford for some years, and out of the blue she gets a sex change."
2,A huge sell-out!!!,"I,ve been a MDB fan since 1993, after listening to their first album. The band has evolved amazingly since, and I consider Turn Loose the Swans to be the best dark music record ever. Then came two very good albums, that succesfully changed the delivery while keeping the quality and mood in its music. But this one is an imense disappointment. Gone is the dynamics and amazing musicianship; the band has experimented as ever, but this time with sucky elements: sampler bullshit, horrendous vocals and two pieces of musical heinousness called ""Heroin chic"" and ""Apocalipse woman"". The reasons it deserves two stars are a couple of nice songs: The second and the last; like if they gathered all the creativity MDB had while writing the album. A definite letdown!"
4,MDB Deserves Better Fans,"It's too bad a great band like MDB has such closed-minded fans! I'm the first to admit that this is NOT their BEST album, but at least they were trying something new, UNLIKE on ""The Light at the End of the World"" which (although it IS a good album) just sounds like a re-hash of their earlier ones. ""34.788%"" has some very good songs (the best one is probably ""The Stance of Evander Sinque"") and a couple not-so-great ones, but not enough to ignore the album for! I hope for MORE experimentation on their next release! Hopefully that will weed out all their closed-minded ""fans"" and just leave us listeners who actually appreciate the band's creativity."
2,Not what I had expected,"I really love MDB's ""The Angel and the Dark River"" and ""Like Gods of the Sun"". These are two of my favorite albums from one of my favorite bands. However, when I bought MDB's new album and took it home to listen to it, almost bursting with anxiety to hear this incredible band's newest (and hopefully best)effort, I was greatly dissappointed. I think the album was aptly named; it is only 34.788 % complete of being a true My Dying Bride album. Like in other reviews, I think ""Heroin Chic"" is terrible. Aaron and the boys really scraped the bottom of the barrel on this one. Since when did Aaron start singing ""nah nah nah na na nah""? I will continue to keep faith in MDB to create something as good as ""Turn Loose the Swans"", no matter how long it takes them. It might just be because they don't have Martin anymore, but as of right now, my bride is dying..."
4,Worth the price for a long drive,"My 4 1/2 year old son had a long car ride and this was one of the DVDs he asked to see over and over again. Its good for this age group and for those kids who love trains. The aphabet part is nice as well, never hurts to sneak a little education in at the same time."
2,boring and cheaply made!,"First, I want to say that the footage, overall, is very good and the presentation is a good idea. However, when put together and packaged for the preschool age-it just isn't a good combination. My 3yo and 6yo both found this to be boring. It just doesn't hold their attention for more than the first 10-15 minutes. I was looking for something to add to our train unit, as I homeschool them. This was not it. I still haven't found what ""it"" is. If you are looking for something that is entertaining as well as informative, this is not it. I was disappointed in this dvd, as I had high hopes for it."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring!","My 3 year old loves trains & trucks and was bored by this DVD. He is learning his ABC's and I'd hoped this DVD would help him. It did not. My 6, 8 & 9 year olds know their ABC's and they thought the DVD was boring. It seems of interest only to model train enthusiasts in need of remedial training. For kids, this purchase was a waste of money."
3,Good,"They work great at keeping the humidity at 70%, but I have to keep them store at an angle in my humidor because they spill through the perforated cap. I also try it in my travel humidor (Cigar Caddy) and it spill all over my cigars. Any advice to correct this?"
3,ok,"Not worked exactly as advertised in small humidor (about 30 cigars). Replaces the sponge, but you have to constantly refill."
2,Doesnt seem to work,"I really wanted to like this product but honestly, it does not seem to do the job. Maybe you need to use at least 5 of these in order provide enough humidification, but still seems like too much of a hassle."
5,Water For The Weary,I recieved this item today and i love it. It automatically soaks up what water you put into it and then timely disperses it in your humidor. I dont yet know how it does that but it has been designed to bring your humidor to 70% and then keep it as close as it can to that. I will be buying one of these soon as a gift for my buddy.
1,Late and Damaged,I received the tube 5 days late. It came in a dinky bubble wrapped package. The tube was completely smashed-in on one side and the absorbing gel was leaking out. Bummer!
1,Horrible...,I purchased the product with high hopes...and have been terribly disappointed. I read the isstructions and followed them exactly...end result was a humidor of DRY cigars. Now I am in rescue mode and will dump these useless things. DO NOT BUY!!!
2,Misleading picture,"I bought this item for my 50 cigar humidor. The picture of the humidifier tube makes it appear that there are a whole bunch of tubes. 'NEWS FLASH' there is only one. Now, 8 bucks for only one tube when you need at least 2 for a 50 cigar humidor. This was certainly not a good deal.About the product-It was quite flimsily packed in a light material plastic tube. Quality of the product was definitely not worth $8. I am sure I could have found something similar or even better at 'some' dollar store.So, learn from my mistake and don't waste money on this.I am still giving two stars because the shipping was fast. Is that the silver lining to this dark cloud? That's for you to decide!!"
1,humiditube,This product is junk. It didn't work at all. I now just use distilled water on a paper towel in a small dish and the humidity stays at 74%.
1,Poor customer service from CheapHumidors,"I bought this item as a gift for someone. When the recipient opened it, the item had been used or damaged because the crystals were already expanded and he wasn't able to add water. It wasn't humidifying properly. I sent the seller an e-mail letting them know. Never heard anything back. I realized this is an inexpensive item, but I'll not be recommending the company to my cigar-smoking friends or buying anything else from CheapHumidors because they aren't good to deal with."
2,Didn't work,"The concept is great and I liked that I didn't have to use distilled water, according to the instructions (I did anyway). However, it couldn't get my humidor above 50% humidity during the winter time. This is after I seasoned my humidor. I have a caliber III hygrometer."
2,Awful packaging,"I understand these things work, so no complaint there. But when the shipment arrived there were the five tubes I had ordered just tossed into a zip lock bag. No instructions at all. Four of the tubes had perforated caps. The fifth tube had no cap but there was a loose solid (different) cap in the bag. All in all pretty sloppy and confusing.I googled the manufacturer...not the Amazon vendor...and he (Jeff) kindly and patiently explained how these things are to be used and how they work."
3,Should have read the description & reviews more closely,"In spite of the picture - this is ONE tube. Just recieved it - do not have an opinion yet - will add to this after a few months. However, the picture and description might (it did me) lead you to think this is a BOX of tubes. It is JUST ONE tube. Might be a wonderful value - can't say yet. But, I wish the description had made it more clear that this was only one tube. BTW - when it comes the minimal instructions indicate that it is good for about 25 cigars... again, not what I expected. Not throwing stones - just wish the vendor was more up front!"
3,This sort of works,This sort of works but not great by any means! I think it's ok for small or travel humidors but I have 2 in my 50 count humidors and it doesn't quite keep the humidity at 70%.
1,They DON'T work...period.,I am amazed at all these other reviews....Who is writing them ???I have two of these in a small humidor with only 20 cigars and the best humidity I can get is 55 %.I can put a little cup of water of water in the humidor with these and I get 80% in 4 hours.
3,desperate for humidity,"I purchased four tubes, followed instructions for use, and placed them in my humidor which contains approx. 100 cigars. That was four weeks ago; so far, very littleDrymistat Humidifier Tubeimprovement! Prior to Drymistat tubes, humidity around 60-61%; presently, 61-62%. I've just ordered four more tubes and am hopeing for the best."
3,Does it work?,Got the product with a little delay. Though the merchant was great and sent me another one when the first one was lost in the mail. The product came with no receipt inside the box. There was no instruction (I had to watch a youtube) to learn how to use it. Even the Drymistat official web site doesn't have detailed isntruction with videos or pictures on how to use it. I am still testing it and still not sure if it's working properly.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased two of these to humidify my 50ct humidor. They worked well when I first got them and kept the humidity around 70. But after it came time to ""recharge"" them, they have not worked nearly as well since. Almost 6 months later and after a fresh refill of regular water, the humidity isn't even reaching 60. I've used other methods to bump my humidity up higher so I've ruled out it being an issue with the humidor or hygrometer."
5,Works great,Really nice and simple. I just dropped one of these in a clasped jar and it kept 20 cigars perfect.
2,Worse than Boveda packs,Nothing much to say but they do not hold RH well at all. I can breath in the humidor and get better RH than these will.
2,Poor Advertisement,By looking at the picture thought I was getting a box of drymistat tubes.Received one tube for 13plus dollars. Could have bought in local cigar store and for 13 dollars could have gotten 3-4 tubes.What a rip off.
3,This is it?,"Ordered the Drymistat tube for a humidor I'm giving as a gift. I was mislead by the photo and thought I was getting a box of the tubes, not a single tube. Why show a photo that is so misleading? It was mailed in an hand addressed envelope with no copy of the invoice and no instructions. Wasn't very professional. Don't know how well it works because I haven't tried it yet. I hope it performs better than the perception I have at the moment."
3,m sure it wouldve worked better had i used it better,i have a box humidor in which the cigars lay in the box. i used these tubes to keep my cigars humidified however when i laid it down the water just spilled out. im sure this needs to stay upright. i think it wouldve worked better for me had i been able to place it upright. it did still keep the level of humidity up in my humidor but the bottom line is i just think it would have lasted longer and worked better placing it upright.
2,Only one tube.,"The product works great, but the picture is deceiving. You only get one tube. A large box gets kind of pricey."
1,this was pretty AWFUL!,"this thing was so bad that I truly feel duped by it in a sick way cuz sympathy usually puts out better stuff. I listen to this thing and it makes me feel better about myself which ain't easy to do because I'm pretty awful myself. I'd say this is pretty stinky and the chix, well anyways. This is stinko."
4,be a deadbeat fan because its fun,"these guys are pretty wacky. a couple of horns, a whole lot of distortion and some goofy yet socially oriented lyrics comprise the Deadbeats. In the begining they dont seem to know how to play their instruments but they bring it all together in the end for a very energetic and depressing and funny album. In conclusion the Deadbeats are spiffy."
1,Not very happy,"I ordered this product however, when I received it the batteries were dead. The company did not follow through with crediting the account for a defective item."
4,a good Freestyle cd,"I reviewd all of Michelles cd's and I am a true Freestylehead.This is a good cd, but the remixes cd is so much better and everyone who buys it knows that I am right.This original cd will collect dust while you will play the remix cd alot more.The rmix cd does have all the original material on this cd ,plus a few more remixes that are alot faster to dance to.The best Freestle cd's from Michelle are ""By your side remixes"" and ""mr.Player"".Hopefully Michelle will have a full-length cd and new maxi singles soon,she is a talented artist."
3,Nice DVD,"I actually expected more on this DVD. I don't believe this DVD did much justice to Brian's musical skills and talent, but it's an ok DVD to pass time when you have nothing else to do."
5,Classical Autumn,"This album is the perfect mood music for the season:1. [Excerpt] [Excerpt]2. Arabesque, for piano No. 1 in E major, L. 66/13.

3,Took way to long too ship!,Not worth the extra expense for the convenience of ordering online. Can get same at staples online faster and cheaper. Came with metal insert but no explanation as to what it was for.
4,Shakkai by L.V. Andrews - Great Book,Lynn writes of her personal experiences and this time Lynn journeyed into her future. While journeying she learns and relates back to us how the good and bad in all of us is important. We should learn to accept each other as we see them in order to learn how to live with all types of spirits and experience because they are all necessary lessons. Keeping ones self in alignment and balanced no matter what the situation wether it be in love or working with an evil spirit. Keeping our own balance is the way to process through any situation.BREATHEDawn
3,Borders on Fiction,"Sad but true this series of books are limited and lack details. In my opinion books or cards written with hidden meanings or that speak of secrets ( that they are not going to reveal ) bring suspicion. When you have read other material that will detail the topic and it's so called sectrets and how you can use or adopt the practices it leaves these book looking like fiction. I no longer buy material that states secrets because usually there is a web site with a course attached to learn the sectrets at a high price.Sadly this series of books lets down entire topic of Native American practices that have spiriual benefits, because they offer no practical methods to the reader to try before you buy. The days of spiritual secrecy are over there is nothing new under the sun and the sincere seeker will find all they need in other books, travel or their own life without paying thousands of dollars.People who want to keep secrets should not write books."
1,What next,"As I tried keeping up with the images and story line, I felt it effecting me like a bad LSD trip. I am not sure what I was supposed to learn from these latest adventures into Wonderland but I will say this was the least entertaining of the series. I think that this type of Shamanism may be running out of gas."
4,Simple Pleasures,"Derivative? Certainly. Shallow? Generally. But what you get with Emma Peel is a band which, like the Rolling Stones before them knows how to ROCK. They play simply-structured, indie-flavored, straight-ahead rock that seldom fails to fascinate, due largely to their ability to collectively lock into a groove-mood like few other bands today can. What ever happened to them?"
2,Doesn't Actually fit a double din radio,I received this dash kit thinking that i would have no problem installing my new alpine ixaw404 double din radio. When I received the product however i noticed that the dash kit was a little to small to fit a standard size double din radio. I semi resolved the issue by purchasing some plastic epoxy and bonding the mount to the metal radio cage. Kind of upsetting though.
3,Had to drill holes...,"Bought this for my 2005 Chevy Equinox when changing out the factory cd player for a ddin. It was easy to put together and to snap the CD unit in, but, the holes on the unit didn't match up to any of the holes on the mounting kit brackets so we had to drill holes into the plastic to be able to screw them in. We ended up only doing on on each side (when it has 2 on each side) because it was just so frustrating. Everything is installed now, and looks great. Keep in mind when purchasing, if you have a silver or black dash. Around my cd player is silver and Metra does offer silver plastic to match, but I didn't realize this was black until after the fact, but it's ok, it doesn't look bad because my CD player is black. Just a little note in case you're curious about the color. I believe the silver model has an S on the end of the model number!"
5,Fits perfectly and matches interior color.,"Bought this item after I purchased the wrong item from amazon first. I asked for a refund from Amazon and they granted it along with telling me that I didn't have to return the original item. This fits a 2004-2007 Malibu perfectly. I have a Pioneer FHP-8000BT Double Din and it fits perfectly. All in all I am very happy with this purchase. It was really easy to install, I did it myself and did not have to modify a single thing. All of the lines/curves/corners match up perfectly with my dash. I was worried about it not fitting correctly with the air control unit, which sits directly under the radio, because it has a slight curve to it. This dash kit mach the curve perfectly. Great Product!"
3,worthy of 3 and 1/2 stars,This was an interesting book. I never watch the show and I was able to follow the plot pretty easily. It is a prequel novel that happens while Sydney is at UCLA for her sophomore year. The pace was slow at parts but everything came together in the end to make it a pretty interesting read. It was well-written. I guess I couldn't give it a 4-5 because its not really my type of book.
3,Improving,"This novel is a vast improvement over Skin Deep, but I still found it to be out-of-character for the series. Ninety percent of the novel is a dialogue inside Sydney's head. The action and nail biting moments that Alias is known for are missing. Kudos for the surprise ending, yet at moments I found it tobe long-winded."
1,CSI Crime Scene Investigation and CSI Dark Motives,"These games seemed to need more than the 1 CD per game that I received. The dark motives game started out okay, but after the 1st case it began to use a foreign language. There was a patch on the UBI Soft website however it wouldn't let me download the patch because it did not recognize that the game was installed on my computer. I ended up having to restore my computer to an earlier date and time to get the games off. I tried to contact J&R Music, which is where the games came from, by email and did not receive a response. I don't believe that I will purchase from J&R Music again. This is not an issue with Amazon as I have ordered many products from them that worked perfectly. However, this particular purchase was extremely disappointing."
4,Almost as Good,"Tommy Conwell just continues to ROCK! But, I sure do miss the Rumblers music. Where can it be found? I saw Tommy and the Young Rumblers many times in the Baltimore area over the years. Sure wish I never lost those old cassettes. But, this cd can still satisfy the Tommy itch. love it"
4,Sweet Strings,"Tommy Conwell is one of the best guitarist alive. This bluesy-rock album is a bit more bluesy than the rock n roll of the Rumblers, but Tommy still jams hard as a rock."
3,WHAT WAS IS NO MORE,"I have been of fan of Tommy Conwell since 1986 when the Young Rumblers were together. Now that was a tight band. That band use to breathe together. What was great about Tommy Conwell and the Young Rumblers was the fusion of rock and blues. How and why Tommy has fallen from grace with a CBS record contract to now performing straight blues with a no name label is beyond my comprehension.This CD doesn't rate with his other CD's because it lacks the melody and soulful songwriting that made those songs so listenable. I guess if your drunk off your @$$ this CD kicks, but I'm not drunk that often. I'm still a fan hoping for that magic that once was."
1,Over Rated!,"After reading all the good reviews I went ahead and bought the Turkey Cannon.On my first try, the unit collapsed under the weight of a 14 lb. turkey and came apart. I could not get it to stay together. (and every time it collapsed it spilled out all the liquid in the cannon and made a mess) There is no way that could hold the weight of a 20 lb. turkey as claimed.It also didn't fit well in my Weber.I'll try it some day with a chicken or much smaller turkey."
5,Works good,It works very good in my smoker and I can even add a bit of beer for a little added flavor. I might be getting another one to do 2 turkeys at once in my smoker.
5,yum,"This works great on the grill or oven. Put down some foil to block any direct heat and it cooks evenly. It's nice to be able to infuse inside the bird. Put in some beer, wine or tea and throw in some herbs to round out the flavor for a well infused smoked bird. Your guests will be impressed. It also makes evenly crisp skin without rack marks on the bird."
3,Not as pictured on Amazon.com,Was dissapointed when i recieved the product. It is not built as solid as the one pictured although it did do a pretty good job roasting the turkey.
1,flimsy piece of $#!+ !!!,I didn't even receive the turkey cannon pictured. the one I was sent slides together and kept coming apart under the weight of the 14 lb. bird. Is supposed to handle up to 20 lbs. I would rate this a ZERO if I could!!
1,Not worth the $3.95 S&H.,"This book could have been great. But unfortunately, the author decided that they would use small images, then blow them up to full-pages. The result is a bunch of fuzzy, very poor images. The limited text is mostly not on X-Planes, but on Prototypes. Save your money and pass on this book."
3,Great Cheap DVD,"The story was alright, but the effects was real cheap, but the story was also -- Wish it had more story"
5,Great music for massages,"I now have this classical album at each home we have, and listen to it for every massage. I find it better than the ""new age"" music the masseurs bring."
3,Great for small spaces,We got this for our son when he was 18 months old and it was the perfect size for him. He absolutely loved this sandbox (using the ladybugs head as a seat) He never got bored of it and still used it two years later. It is VERY durable and after two years of use looks brand new after spraying it down with a hose. Some of these sand boxes are so big and hard to move (to mow or keep your grass from dying)But this is the perfect size. A bigger kid couldn't sit in it very comfortably but could still have just as much fun sitting beside it to play with the sand.
3,This is a good sandbox but not great..,"This sandbox is a little small. It's perfect for one child but not two as some of the reviews said. My one-year-old daughter had a friend over and the two of them could barely fit in there together with a few toys. The worst part of this sandbox is the top. Since it is attached it is awkward and in the way when the sandbox is open. Also, it would be nice if it was a tight fitting top. Instead the top just sits on top of the box. Unfortunately it is loose enough that the neighborhood cats can just push it off if they want. You need to put something heavy on top if you want to avoid unwanted visitors. But despite all that, it is a nice little sandbox that my daughter enjoys. It serves the purpose that it was purchased for."
5,Must reading!,"I found this book to be extremely helpful in understanding where Jews and Catholics agree and where they agree to disagree. I especially liked the section on the respective liturgies of the Jewish and Catholic faith traditions. It was so interesting to see how Catholicism is firmly based on the foundation of Judaism... and how Catholicism has, in turn, influenced Judaism! The dialogue format between a Catholic priest and a Jewish rabbi was especially helpful. All in all, a valuable book on the dialogue between Jews and Catholics."
5,Wow! Should have bought this sooner!,"Aziza is such a gem!!! As someone taking bellydance classes from a teacher, DVD's typically aren't challenging. This is not the case with this one. The defining moment for me was the shimmy drills! Get your water bottle & a towel ready for this part! Aziza's charm & wit shines through the entire program and her performances are stunning. This is a must buy for any dancer!!!!!"
3,"Nice section on arms, but overall pretty meh","I didn't care for this.Content: It's okay. The pace is very slow, which bored me. There is a nice section on arms, but everything else just lacks any excitement, and doesn't bring anything that a million other bellydance DVDs don't also offer.Setting: Not good. She's facing a small army of students to are about six inches from her at all times. Cramped and strange.I felt this DVD, for me, was not really worth spending money on. I think it could have been a lot better with different pacing and a better set (and no students!)."
4,"Really cute, a little thin","I ordered this for my sister, she loved it. It was a little thinner than I had imagined, but it was a perfect fit for a toe ring!"
5,Works for Herding dogs,I have used this product for 2 years to keep my sheltie's pads supple. They would crack in dry conditions whenever we had sheep herding lessons. It gets dry and hot in Louisiana. This does not stain. After receiving and opening it I have learned that kinda mixing it with my thumb helps to keep it from becoming crumbled. My dogs have never tried to lick it and their pads stay soft and supple. No more cracking. I try to use it weekly and daily when herding. Did not know it was made in China though....may try another product.
1,a waste of money,I bought this stuff because my older dog keeps slipping on my wood floors at home. It's hard to apply and didn't seem to make a difference at all. Whatever!
1,It's Like Putting Ear Wax On Your Dog's Paws!,Horrible product and really deserves NO STARS (Would have given no stars if I could have)! Tried it on my dogs and ended up taking it back to the store. It's disgusting; looks and feels like ear wax. Yuck! Musher's Secret is the best product to use by far!
3,8 in 1 Excel; Paw Wax,the wax really helped my mothers guide dog a lot. honestly his pads were realy dry and this stuff just conditioned his paws. i would def. reccomend this stuff. the only hard part is applying it.
1,Very Disapointed,"The product is great. But this shipment was old and dried out. For shame.The product was all dried and shrunken, with a hard layer over the top. I have used this product before and it is not supposed to be like that."
2,Undecided - bad product or bad tin?,"I bought this product after reading all the positive reviews stating it kept older dogs from slipping on linoleum. I have a 12-year-old german shepherd with arthritis and would love to find a product to aid her stability. But having tried it a couple of times now, I can't figure out how those reviewers can be singing praises (?) The top of the wax was hardened and when I finally got a few gobs to coat the pads of her paws, it basically just left waxy prints all over my kitchen floor (while she continued to slip). . . Is there something I'm missing here? I want to believe that this will work, but at this stage it seems as though I might as well be putting old vaseline on her feet."
3,Paw Wax,"This product is okay, but is a harder wax than Musher's paw protector wax. It softens and protects my dog's paws thus better than nothing, but the application is more difficult due to it being a harder wax."
2,Couldn't get it to work,The texture of the paw wax was chunky and I could not get it to spread on my dog's paws evenly.
5,"this book is a must if you really love your pets,","This books content is out of this world, taking you further than any book i have ever read. I could not put it down from start to end. One of the questions i often ask myself is does my dog really know just how much i love him. After reading lindas book and trying the ttouch i got my answer. Yes he does and the feeling is returned ten fold. Thankyou linda"
2,Great ideas but totally inadequate instruction,"As a sales pitch for Tellington Touch, this book is great. As an instruction manual, it is totally worthless. Complex gestures such as those mentioned in the book need illustrations that take one step-by-step through the manipulation process. There aren't any, just a few photos that show one stop action part of the whole.It did get me to take a T-Touch workshop, which was beneficial for my old and arthritic dog. The process works. The book doesn't."
5,The Tellington Touch,A revolutionary natural method to train your dogs and cats and probably just any pet that you may have. It works on horses also.
3,Good technique,I bought this book on reccommendation of a wonderful puppy trianer when my dog had hurt his back. I started it but it is a difficult (boring) read. I do massage the dog's back from what I learned and the dog is better so.
4,A nice way to be closer with your pet,"I have a hyper terrier that has learned to enjoy the Telllington TTouch. I'm no pro after reading this book, and I'm not sure if I believe all their claims. I do know that if I use it on my Max I can put him to sleep with it. When we first got him he didn't feel comfortable with his hindquarters being touched. Since I have been using the TTouch he is much more relaxed in that area. I use it on his gums, too. He needs to chew a lot. I don't know if it helps, but he sure doesn't mind it."
3,Lake Natomas,"Tom, Your book is full of wonderful information which I use when fishing any number of the Central Sierra and Sacramento Valley lakes and rivers. The book allows you to picks a place you would not normally fish and then use some of the techniques which you present to actually catch fish. Thanks a lot for the great info. Sincerely Doug Yeggy P.S. Lake Natomas record rainbow is now over 21 lbs and I have personally caught a Landlocked King which weighed in a 7 3/4 lbs."
4,"Good drive, so-so card","I purchased this kit primarily for the excellent Pioneer drive. It is among the fastest you can get, and works like a charm. The included Utobia decoder card, allthough ostensibly superior to most (same people who make the Hollywood Magic), does not work with Windows 2000. I don't really mind this, as I just use a software viewer instead. Utobia promises they'll have a driver out soon. An easy five stars for the drive, just should have mentioned the card requires 95/98/NT."
5,Great DVD for the price,"This is a great DVD. The manual is horrible, so setup might take longer for a person that is new to installing DVD drives. The picture is crisp and never skips. The decoder card is great, add it to dolby digital speakers, like the cambridge DT2500 and you are set. Also, there are new drivers for win2000, so you can play DVD movies in win2000 now."
5,Wow! What an incredible book!,"This book was a sheer pleasure to read! The book is broken down into different subject matters and has an abundance of passages from all the world's major religions. It also has very helpful spiritual practices at the end of each section. The time and work that went into this project must have been enormous! This work is truly exhaustive. I found it very reassuring how the different religions or paths have in common. It was nice to step out of our ""Christian"" culture and see that other religions have very similar passages as well on the various subject matters being addressed. Though, they weren't identical of course. If you are seeking and want a great place to start or a source that is very helpful and illuminating, this book will help you! I commend everyone who worked on this book and who brought it into this world. THANK YOU!"
5,New Generation 'Works It Out',"'Worked It Out' is awesome. This video is a must-see for all RD & NG fans. If you are not a fan and you like the contemporary-traditional gospel sound, you should check it out also. RD & NG show out. Kim Burrell makes a guest appearance on ""Jesus Paid It All."" Other greats include ""Worked It Out,"" ""The Good Shepherd,"" and ""Every Knee Shall Bow."""
5,Definitely a diamond in the rough,"You know, there are some albums that you can find a song for every occasion and this is one of them. It starts of with ""Every Knee Shall Bow"" and I was so floored it took me a while to be done with that one and listen to the rest of the album. ""Through It All"" broke me (and my voice from all the singing I did with the video) and ""Who Can I Run To"" took a famous secular song and placed God first. It's definitely an album that will bless anyone who watches...no matter where they are in their walk."
1,Not the text to use for intro Histology,"I bought this book because it was on the textbook list for my histology course in med school but was extremely disappointed with it's content. Having had histology as an undergrad in university, I really didn't feel this book makes it easy for the beginner to learn histology (especially since the photomicrographs are not in colour). Many of my classmates used Ross et al. ""A Text and Atlas of Histology."" Basic Histology may be good for a reference text, but not an intro Histo textbook. I could not in good conscience recommend this text for first year med students or for someone just taking histo for the first time."
3,Depends what you are looking,"This is a Histology Book with very low grade pictures compared to other nice shiny picture books that have their own problems. Book provides more information about the components but graphics are very weak. It could be used as a reference book but not as a sole source book. I found ""Functional Histology"" book better.When certain structural components are explained book relies on some previous knowledge, so it is not a self sufficient book. So half quality information and half quality pictures, good for exam preparation to refresh your knowledge."
2,"Before buying this one, consider buying Ham's Histology","Although this book is very cheap and easy to use, the information in it is very poor. Once you read Ham's Histology by Cormack, you'll get what I mean."
3,"Good textbook, but be aware of the limitations","I found this book to be a good introduction to histology. It is limited in two ways: The first is that it is truly 'Basic Histology'. This is a plus and a minus. On the plus side, the book resists the temptation to drown the student in a sea of detailed molecular and cellular biology. I think this was intentional, and they do a good job of cutting to the chase. On the minus side, too many of the images are of poor quality. As an instructor of this subject, I found it quite frustrating that some of the schematics (which are supposed to help me get my point across) were of such low resolution that they appeared out of focus on a powerpoint presentation. This is not acceptable in this era of digital imaging. I would use this book again, but only if the image problem is corrected."
2,Not a stand alone Histology Text,"This book was required reading for histology class as an undergrad. It was not bad as far as strict histology went, however, in my opinion, this book is not very useful as a stand alone book. It seems it is designed to be read along with a histology atlas, or more importantly, a gross anatomy text. This book seems to assume that one already has some basic concept of gross anatomy and this book is most suited as a suppliment to anatomy. The writing in some places is hard to follow, and there are a few typo's. All in all, i would not recommend this text as a histology text if you are taking only histology. If however you are taking anatomy as well, this text may be sufficient."
4,Basic Histology,This book is very informational. It has alot of information needed by students and is also very helpful in identifying cell structures that are seen on histologic slides after staining.I use it daily while QC'ing slides after H&E; staining.
2,It works but not what expected and advertised,"I ordered this book thinking that I would receive an actual book but instead got a burnt copy of the book on CD. Not even the original CD copy and definitely not what was listed in the title or main part of the description! If I had wanted an e-book I could have gotten it from an online database or library but I was looking for a book I could hold in my hands. Going back to look at the ad for it this book was listed by the seller as Basic Histology: Text & Atlas (Basic Histology)Paperback which suggests an actual book although the second or third sentence in the explanation did say it was a CD but even then, it is surprising that I had to pay that much for a burnt CD instead of the original. I was very surprised and pretty unhappy but because of time constraints did end of keeping the item and using it as I could and the CD itself does work, assuming you have easy access to a computer when you are studying."
3,"Good textbook, but with a drawback","This textbook is very detailed and so provided all of the information that I was looking for. However, the lack of a glossary is a major drawback. Including one would have made the study of histology much easier."
2,not worth it,This isn't a very helpfull book at all. Just has afew of each catagory. Not like the old beckets by any meens
1,TERRIBLE~!,"First of all, I HATE the BIG UGLY picture of American Car Racer...do not know his name, on the cover of the book. Second, I hate NASCAR and Cheap political HOT WHEEL junk I do not even care for looking at. The book should focus on HIGH QUALITY COLLECTIBLE BRANDS ONLY. What a waste of paper~!!!"
4,Good for younger girls,"I think this book would be good for girls ages 9 and under who would like to clear the clutter in their room and make some simple projects to brighten it up, but a girl who is 10 years old or over would probably want a more mature style for their room. This book's main focus was cleaning up the clutter in your room, with some projects at the end like painting your dresser, making a bedspread, or decorating a lamp. Since the book didn't have too many projects, I think it would be best to skip this book if you want to give your room a make-over. If you want to redo your room, I would suggest reading ""Room for You"", ""Have Fun With Your Room"", or ""Super Suite""."
3,eh...,"Its OKAY, but American girl can be a little more creative than this. I found nothing that was intresting enough to go in my room.I suggest you find a different american girl book."
1,EEWWW!!!,"Do NOT waste your money on this book! It is so weird.......it is REALLY outdated. I mean, it was published in 1997 for Pete's Sake! Styles have changed. Seriously though, who ties back their curtains with a jumprope??? (no offense if you do)So.....Don't waste your money! The tips are REALLY REALLY REALLY outdated!BYE!!!"
1,not enough projects,"this book is great for little kids, but if you are over the age of 8, DONT GET THIS BOOK! it has projects such as painting flowerpots, insturctions on how to store your beanie babies, and more. its basiccly only got projects to ""brighten your bedroom"". most of the projects defintly didn't help my room and I tried two before I shoved the book to the back of my cupboard. it has like 8 projecs, and not good ones either. i usually like the books from american girl, but this was the worst one i have ever read."
5,What A Help! Bargain Bonanza!,"When I started redecorating my room, I looked at stores for good sales on bedding, curtains, etc. I didn't find good prices. The the magic began when I saw this marvelous book at Media Play. Groom You Room has helped my tremendously with my decorating project! It has tips on organization, homemade spreads, storage, crafts, and what to do with all the stuff that falls in the ""whatever"" category. The best part, you ask? The best part is, drumroll please...... You can make all of it with stuff you have around the house! It's fun, it's creative, it's free! So, what are you waiting for? Order Groom Your Room today and start the adventure that will boost your confidence and make the best of your enviroment! Hope you love it as much as I do!"
4,It's the perfect American Girl Book to get first!,"I absolutely loved this book! It made me realize how great the American Girl Library Books are. Now I've gotten a few more and am still looking for some. Once you read this book you'll realize how easy some crafts are and how fun they can be! You'll definetely want to run out and read another one, a craft book or not!"
1,Not a great decorating book,"This book is very short and it's for young girls. It's bad because it just shows ideas of things to use to make your room ""brighter"" by using things around the home. None of the ideas are even good to use at all! This is a poorly done book on ... decoration though I wouldn't call it decorations!"
2,the kitchen sink,This is a poorly written laundry list of a book with plenty of unnecessary filler facts such as the names of Elizbeth David's myriad friends. I suspect that nobody edited it.
4,Half of a Dirk Gently story,"This is the third, unfinished Dirk Gently story including a hippopotomus that appears to pass through a wormhole from London to LA and a cat whose hind end is invisible, as if it is stuck halfway through a wormhole.This half of a story was on Douglas Adams' computer when he passed away.The audio is read very well and for two discs I was on the edge of my seat until the story ends abruptly.It would be nice if some blogger would call for submissions for writers to post their completions of this story."
5,Life changing,This author is honest & precise. I have never read an ethics book quite like it. EVER! I will offer this as part of out business curriculum at our school as well.
2,Slow..,"I don't know if I am just overwhelmed with school or this book is a really dry read. It can't keep my attention. Topics covered are nice.. but I'm just not feeling it. To be fair, all my other classmates who have read the book say that it's great and an easy read."
1,i would not recommend you to read this book,I was assigned to read this book for social religion class. I did not find it very interesting to read. most of the stories are business stereotype. The book itself is very confusing. It seems that it keeps repeating itself- over and over.
3,"20"" Huffy Bike for Christmas 2006","This was a Christmas gift for my son, his first two wheel bike. I should have never bought this on line. The box was ripped open at the front wheel. I was glad that there was no main damage. Only the chain guard was broke. I had to fix it with a wire tie. Take my advice and buy local for a bike. Especially if it is for Christmas. I would have returned it if it was not so close to Christmas. This will make me pick cafefully what I buy on line."
5,Wonderful disc,This is such a great cd. It is just a perfect cd to just sprawl on the couch and zone out too. The progression from one to another is perfect and the whole cd fits together like butter. The music overkills the lyrics but it makes sense after a few listens. Overall a great cd for any music lover.
5,3= years,"I got these headphones 3 years ago. During those years i did plenty of abuse to it and it never has failed on me until now. The actual headphones fits perfectly on me. My current headphones has a broken right speaker, if i wiggle the cable around i am able to fix it but i might as well get this again."
3,As the title says about spiritual roots,"This book is a essey written about Spiritual rootsSome shinto and some buddism deitiesfew ritualsThe book is ok, but no need to buy if you havethe 5 (now 6) piece bookseries from Hayes"
4,Very nice piece,"This is a lovely necklace, my only complaint would be a slight impurity in the gem that hangs down. But I love the necklace, nice quality and a great value."
4,"Prompt service, pretty good condition","I received this product quickly and with no hassles. The book has some wear, but as far as I'm concerned, that's not what's important. Everything is completely readable and usable. No service received that was not expected, so I give a 4 stars."
1,"Terrible Book, DONT BUY IT!!","I used this book for a class in colloege and I am surprised it costs 55 dollars. What kind of moron printed this pile of headaches. The author goes in circles, and the book teaches nothing.If you want to learn C programming.BUY THIS BOOK! ITS GREAT!The C Programming Language Brian W. Kernighan Dennis M. RitchieThe guy who say he teaches a course with this book. Get a different book, you are another example of instructors in college who are unprepared and have no idea how to teach anything."
4,"I liked this book, and also its companion on C++","I worked through this book doing the problem sets and exercises, and got a lot out of it. This is a book for meticulous readers, and covers a C with detail and consistency I found nowhere else. You have to work at it, but this book will teach you C in greater depth than any other I've found."
2,not user-friendly,"This book is numb to what a student of c needs clarification and expansion on, and what is obvious. I told a friend that if this book were about donuts, it would talk incessantly about the hole, and assume the donut itself needs only a brief mention. This book is definitely not a reference. It is a beginning-to-end narrative of all topics. The examples are consistently lacking. For example, to get information on structures, one reads a series of small, piecemeal discussions of what structures do. Equal emphasis is given on, for example, the scope of structures (donut hole) as on the syntax to access a structure member in a program (donut), followed by a 3-page sample program that uses one structure in a minor way (huge donut hole). This book will not teach c on its own. At best, it will reinforce or expand on what one already knows."
2,There are better books on the market.,"I found the examples too complex, as if they were written by an advanced math major. I'm using the book in a C programming college course and I had to go out and buy another book to explain the concepts more clearly."
4,Overall Satisfied,The authors give a truly indept lesson for a person learning C with little or no prior knowledge of C/C++ programming.A background of some other language is pretty important. The authors don't waist time explaining the basics of all programming languages to you.I only really have one problem with this book. It was a little too expensive; but all college books seem to be that way.It may seem to be a little outdated (Published in 1996) but the information is still current. I have seen few in depth books written for C since that time. Most new books talk about C++ and now C#.I strongly recomend to anybody wishing to learn C++ to first read this book.
4,Great but short,"I just finished watching this DVD, being a Genesis fan since some time ago, I was very excited for the release of a Genesis DVD. The sound is very good , the picture is great, the interviews are new considering they have not played together since 1992. The highlights are the bonus songs played in the studio including the horizons version played by Steve Hackett.For some reason they did not covered the Abacab album on this edition. Great purchase with few low points like it is too short."
2,"It was ok, the bonus material was more interesting.","The documentary itself I feel was a waste of time. I had heard all of this material before, and basically all of it you can find on the internet. The acoustic performances in the bonus material are the highlight for me, quite cool. It appeared to me that the editing for the documentary was quite sloppy, and there was even an audio click during the docu which quite frankly should have been caught. This audio click was present in both mixes so..........."
3,Where's the good stuff?,"Interesting stuff if you didn't already know the history. For those who have heard & seen this information many times before, I am sure we are wondering where the rest of 'The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway' live footage is (for me the best part of this DVD being the snippet of Gabriel performing 'In the Cage' circa 1975). This is what I would like to see on DVD. It would also be nice to see all the other VHS concerts transferred to DVD. What's the hold up? If you can't wait, go and watch 'Cinema Show'......"
3,"Same old footage, new interviews...","Were you like me--was the only great thing about this DVD the new version of ""Afterglow"" and the clip of Peter Gabriel performing ""In The Cage"" circa 1975? Otherwise, you've seen most of everything else on earlier documentaries. WE WANT COMPLETE PERFORMANCES, GUYS. The documentary gave a good sense of the group and its goings on, and where they are today. Even Ray Wilson seemed tolerable. It would've been good at about five dollars less than it was. The spirit of the band is there, and it was especially interesting to hear Hackett talk, but after all that I wanted more from The Lamb tour."
1,Useless,"Except for the material about Ray Wilson, this video brings nothing new to the Genesis story. Those interested in learning about the group should buy a much better video called ""Genesis A History"" released in 1989. I, as well as others, would rather see full-length concerts of Genesis during pivotal years such as 1974, 1976, 1978, or 1980. There is a shameful lack of video available for this seminal art rock group. DVD is the perfect medium for music video. I hope the rights owners of the concert videos ""Three Sides Live"" or ""In Concert 1976"" will take advantage.[DW]"
2,Genesis Talkbook?,"Hmmm. The title, ""Genesis Songbook"" should provide some guidance to the buyer shouldn't it? It did not and I am very bitter about what appears to be an interview documentary interspersed with songclips and a few singles. I have been a dedicated fan for years and had high expectations. I have had those expectations met with the DVD releases by Seve Hackett their former guitarist. There must be something better out there. The interviews were fine but not I have not a single urge to watch it again."
4,Wonderful Fun,"My 4 year old has been OBSESSED with sharks lately and when he heard of this magical beast named Megalodon...well I had to find more on it. We love this book, great illustrations and concise text keeps his attention and is a ""short"" bedtime read."
4,"Good, but formative","This sounds a little different than Acid King's latest work, but it is still worth checking out. Lo-fi and bass-heavy, the songs are more like a mix of early Melvins with Acid King's Busse Woods(ie acid-rock Melvins)Best songs are Evil Satan, 196, Tank."
3,Odd Indeed,"But overall, I enjoyed this disk. If you like the oodball track that SHJ throws on each album (such as 'Galapagos 3') then you'll enjoy this cd too. Heck if you like Lennon/Yoko's 'Revolution 9' from the White Album, then you should definitely buy this disk! There's something very playful going on here. SHJ are just messing around creating quirky electronic music/noise. It's kinda refreshing in strange way. I give them guts for releasing this cd."
4,Superior to the leading brands.,"I use reusable cloth pantyliners (Lunapads brand), which I love but I bought these disposable liners to use after I work-out at night, because I change as soon as I get home and it is not good to stay in damp clothes too long. I have very sensitive skin, allergies, and currently only own 4 reusable pantyliners so these help. They really do breathe so much better then other brands and they are good for sensitive skin.I don't think the small price difference is a negative, my health and yours are worth it. They hold better then I expected too. I give it 4 stars because they are superior to other disposable liners, but I can't give it 5 stars because my other ones can be washed and used over and over, which is better for the environment and they have wings that snap together and no sticky tape so no chance of them ever grabbing hold of things other then my undies. :)"
4,Works well,"These work just as well as the ""toxic"" brands but, I know that chemicals aren't leaching into my body every time that I use them."
2,"Too narrow, but nice cushion",They are too narrow for most normal undies & the strip is hard to get off the sticky part.They are soft and have a nice cushion though.
2,Is this for real?,These are the puniest panty liners I have ever seen. They are so small and narrow it's hard to believe they can actually be useful. The adhesive is very minimal and barely holds the product in place. These are only good if you need something for precautionary purposes only. I don't imagine they will actually absorb very much. I will not be buying this product again.
4,Back to the future,"One of the two top new American big bands to come along with the revival of swing music (Bill Elliott has the other), the Eddie Reed band shows that it can recreate the sound of the big band era without being a mere copy of some long-dead band. Reed handles the male vocals well, but he has found a very good girl singer in Meghan Ivey who sounds a little like Kitty Kallen. She is particularly good on ""The Lamp Is Low"". Listen to the Gene Krupa hits, ""Boogie Blues"" and ""Let Me Off Uptown"", as well as ""Jazznocracy"", last heard by Jimmie Lunceford. This band can swing. At long last, big bands are really back!"
1,She's got to be kidding....,"If you need to cover something,then do it your own way.EXPRESS YOURSELF.I dont know why anybody would want to listen to this record when you can have ""the real thing"".For you guys who like this record,be prepared to be blown away......"" FRANCE GALL ""... is the name which will keep you addicted for a long time.Just listen to the original "" Laisse Tomber Les Filles "" (or infact anything out of her sixties stuff),and then you'll know what I mean.The choice is yours."
5,Nice to have,"The trailer seems pretty durable much like the wagon it goes with. Assembly was pretty easy but you definately need a hammer to help wack things in place. It's large enough for my 3 year old to ride in comfortably. I don't know that I would put a baby carrier in it although I didn't try. The one thing I don't particularly like is that it seems to take a lot of muscle to get it on and off. Although over time, I believe it will get easier as it wears down. I've had to sit on it, kick it, push, shove and wack to get the trailer on and off the hitch. Even though it's difficult to get on and off, it won't keep me from using it."
3,Does not fit new safari wagon.,"Where to start here. The bushing ""plug"" that goes into the hole under the back seat of the wagon (as with every other step2 wagon) is too small for the hole in the Safari Wagon. Also, the tongue of the trailer doesn't meet up to the hitch ball very well due to the rear axle. If you can wedge the plug in place (temporarily) so as you try to connect the trailer, you pull the hitch and plug out of the wagon. Don't buy in combination with the safari wagon (really like this new wagon) until Step2 resolves or unless you are capable of engineering a solution yourself."
1,TAG ALONG TRAILER IS NOT MADE FOR THE PEDAL FARM TRACTOR.,"WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR TOYS FOR MY 4 YEAR OLD SON, I SAW THE PEDAL FARM TRACTOR. ON THE SAME PAGE AS THE PEDAL FARM TRACTOR, WAS A PICTURE OF THE TAG-ALONG-TRAILER PLUS. SINCE IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THESE TWO TOYS GO TOGETHER, I PURCHASED BOTH. HOWEVER, UPON ASSEMBLING THE TRAILER, IT TURNS OUT THAT THE TRAILER DOES NOT GO WITH THE FARM TRACTOR. BASED UPON A STEP 2 BROCHURE, THERE IS ANOTHER TRAILER THAT GOES WITH THE TRACTOR."
1,This wagon extension is unsafe by itself,This product is unsafe if not attached to another wagon. The daycare that my child attends had one. My two-year-old daughter was sitting in it when another toddler tried to pull her for a ride. The handle flipped up sending my daughter for a hard fall onto the asphalt.
1,Boo!,"This game is terrible. It's hardly like the TV show and the corny space-age graphics are just not necessary. Don't bother buying this version, it's just not worth it."
1,doesn't work,"Our dvd starts, and explains all of the rules, lets you choose a game and see the categories, but does not let you choose a category. Once we press enter to begin, it goes straight to the very first start up screen."
1,don't waste your money,We have the original Pyramid board game and love to play so we thought the new electronic version would be fun. It's a complete disappointment. The DVD is so slow in responding when you want to advance to the next word that it takes 2-3 seconds per clue. The clock keeps running so it's almost impossible to just get through the first round. Then the bonus round is really impossible. The game is sluggish and unresponsive. It really was a waste of money.
3,"$100,000 Pyramid DVD Game","This game is a lot of fun and very similar to the TV version. However,one thing they do not tell you in the description is that there areONLY 15 EPISODES on the game. With sales tax, shipping & handling, thatcomes to about 2 bucks an episode. Not worth it in my book."
1,dvd game,It doesnt work- I called the company and they said they took it off the market 5 years ago due to being defective.!!!!!
2,The massage therapy library: Vol 12 (PNF),This DVD has an excellent section on the theories of PNF but I found the practical component lacking. I would like to have seen more PNF in practice
2,"Snippets of insight, but so substance","I had seen this author interviewed on several different forums and was eager to read ""Talk to Me; Listening Between the Lines"". This book has so much promise, bringing to mind the work of Studs Terkel.....and that promise is never realised. Anna Deavere Smith emerges as a ""talking head"" interested in putting her spin on what she hears rather than listening. There is no lack of potentially engrossing material, Washington,D.C. or the Beltway as insiders call it, a women's correctional facility, access to rich, famous and powerful....and it is all wasted. This book was a real disappointment."
2,I don't get it,"I've heard this author being interviewed a few times. She always mentions this technique she uses of writing down EXACTLY what the person she is interviewing says. She includes all the uh's, umm's ... everything.The problem is, none of the interviewers ever asks the next question, namely, why do that? What's the point?I hate to be the person who says the king has no clothes on, but for the life of me I just don't see the big advantage of reading an, uh, interview, that, ummm, has, has, all the actual, the specific, uh, words and sounds the person, ah, says."
3,"Bad movie, good riffs.","Living in Oregon, I have to say whoever wrote this stink machine did little if no research. (i.e. We don't have a 'Southern Alabama' accent, etc.) But, what can I say. Riffing was good, movie was bad. That's what Rifftrax is!"
1,Abnormal special,"Another problem product by the supervision of ""the deep throat."" ""It is the first-ever enema movie"". It is the feeling that I performed to the place to already go. It is desperation."
5,Glorious!,"A friend of mine had this CD, and I liked it so much, I had to have my own! Track #8, featuring Belinda Yates, transports the listener to soul-stirring heights. On a good stereo system, it sounds as if one is in a cathedral, with that incredible soprano voice soaring beyond the earthly realm. Wonderful music, wonderful price!"
3,Tiny!,"Just a warning that this edition of Jazz is quite small. It's about the size of a large post card. In addition, the shape of the book- just like the picture, duhh- forces most of the images inside to be even tinier. A cute book, but definitely not a great way to enjoy Matisse's fine work."
4,Secure Sounds Digital Multi-Room Monitor,"We just purchased this item this week. We love being able to listen to both children at the same time for an affordable price. After talking to my husband these are the pros/cons.PROS:-sound is very clear-lightweight-self-rechargable battery (I love this feature!)-no static if you turn off the transmitter in the child's room and receiver is still on-ability to pick whether to listen to both children or just oneCONS:-background noise (ie.fan in child's room, etc.) loud on lowest volume setting -- only a problem at night as my husband is a light sleeper-My husband really doesn't like the buttons on the transmitters/receiver. You have to press down and hold them to turn it on off, hold two buttons in for a few seconds to listen to both rooms -- easy to accidentally push a button when moving the monitor making it just listen to one child's room -- hard to explain, may just take some getting used to.We have been very pleased with this product!"
3,"Since it's one of your only options, worth it, otherwise not.","There aren't many two room monitors on the market, so if you need one, this one is okay and by okay, I mean truly okay, at best. It goes out of range frequently, meaning you can't always get a signal to monitor either room, without even moving any of it's components. Also, the sound quality can be very poor, any noise you hear sounds like Darth Vader at times. Furthermore, you cannot purchase an additional receiver from anywhere, including the manufacturer. If I didn't have two children and if there were more options available, I wouldn't buy it."
3,Pit Trading for Dummies,"Written for and intended for aspiring pit traders. There is one section with 21 traits of successful vs. unsuccessful traders that is worth taking notes on and seeing how you apply to them. Otherwise, there is very little about trading methods. I suppose this is logical, as pit traders have their own obvious edge - buying the bid, selling the ask. It's hardly a secret.For any off the floor trader though, not worth buying."
5,Amazing book!,"If you don't buy this book, you're missing out on some great literature by this great author.Buy this book if you love Nicholas Cage. The author sure does. Unfortunately (or fortunately) I don't think the book contains good ol' Nick. Buy it anyways!"
1,The Great Work,"Couldn't follow the somewhat choppy story line. The charchters were wierd, boring and did not make much sense. was i readong "" The Great Work""?"
3,Urgist,It is a very nice item....certainly not the highest quality but it serves a purpose. And for the price a decent piece of furniture to have
1,Not worth the trouble,"I received this unit as a Christmas gift after having put it on my wish-list, thinking that it would suffice until my husband and I could afford something better. Unfortunately, the holes for the second wine shelf were drilled incorrectly at the factory. I am pretty handy and attempted to secure it using nails, but the cheap wood split. The very bottom shelf below the lowest wine shelf was only stapled on with tiny staples- it fell off... Don't waste your money. Spring for something better. There's no point in risking a shelf breaking under the weight of the wine bottles and creating a REAL mess...."
4,would have been better without the guests,"Maybe it would have helped if I were British too, but I did not recognize a number of the guests they had on this season, and the guests were not all that interesting, though I did like Phyllida Law and Imelda Staunton.The sketches are mostly successful, though a few go on too long. Hugh performs some excellent songs in this season, while Fry continues to amaze with his command of language and rapid delivery.So, overall, not as good as the first 3 seasons but still worth viewing. The Mr. Burmie vet's office sketch is particularly hilarious."
5,SO glad I got the double sided cover!,"I love this cover, almost more than I love the Bobby pillow! The green side is a lovely soft warm chenille, and feels really cozy. It is a nice mossy green, and though the print side has some pink, it is not so much that it feels overly girl-y. I love that it always seems soft and warm for my baby to be snuggled on top of, and in the very heat of the summer I could flip it and use the cool print side. It washes beautifully, though I always line-dry it so that the chenille stays nice."
5,The picture doesn't do it justice,"The fabric for both sides is beautiful, and suitable for a boy or a girl. It's very well constructed, and of course it fits the boppy miracle middle nursing pillow."
3,never again - the worst-tried two of them.,Well first of all we bought bothe the wagon and the tag along trailor. The wagon within one summer had the plastic where the wheels go in give out. We went the next summer and got another wagon figuring it was just that one and a fault with that spicific wagon. Well agian the same thing happened. Both times to the front wheels. I was/ am really disappointed. I will not buy another one. The tag along is in excellent shape. Now if your thinking that it is because my kids must weigh a lot I assure you they do not they are only 5 and 3 and weigh 30lbs each so itis not that I over weighted it at all either.
1,Junk toy,We have got the Fire engine for 2 and the wagon for 2 both toys one of the front wheels are bad. Of course the kids don't play with them so their sits [price] and the company will not done anything.
2,"Great Wagon, Not Durable","Bought this wagon after extensive research. Step 2 is known for good quality products. After 2 days, front tire was bent out of shape. Exchanged it for another one, this time, not only did the tire bend out of shape, it started to crack!Overall, good wagon, but unusable due to inferior quality tire/axle."
4,Twins plus one having fun!,"We bought the wagon and the trailer for our 3 girls, Sarah and Breanna, age 2 1/2, and Jasia, age 15 months. I found they absolutely love it. They take turns which spot they sit in. Since all are under the weight limit for the trailer, they do not fuss as much about who sits in it. Due to safety concerns, they only play with the trailer attached in the house or in the grass.I would not advise anyone to have a child ride in the trailer on a hard surface. The trailer is really just made for toys. I wish they made it with higher sides.ALSO they like to personalize it with chalk! I just wash it off with the hose!Overall, a very satisfying purchase."
2,Not very durable,"This was given to us as a gift. My wife and I take our kids walking quite frequently (in this models defense) and burnt this model out in one season. My kids were 7 months old and 2 years old. What caused the problems was the metal post for the wheel caused the plastic of the wagon to rip. This is most likely (in my belief)from the cracks in sidewalks. This wagon was fun while it lasted, but it isn't much fun to carry a wagon and a child home at the same time."
1,not a good company to deal with,I purchased this wagon for 2 of my five childern. The handle broke off (cracked) Called the company because they are supposed to have a lifetime warranty. The hassle began 1) I was to send picture 2) then find my reciept 3) send them the wagon (who can find the time and do all these things with a house full of childern Then after all that they did nothing after 6 months of waiting I called back and they wanted me to do this all again I told them I sent it all I no longer have the product they said they were sorry there is nothing they can do. I will never purchase a step2 product again and advise against anyone else to . They do not stand behind there products
2,get the radio flyer,"I bought this little wagon as a Chrismas gift for my 1 1/2 year old son. He loves it and has lots of fun in it around the house but I wish I had spent the $10.00 extra dollars for the Radio FLyer red plastic wagon with seats that fold up and down to make a solid bottom. The Wagon For 2 DOES NOT. If you are out and about, your child CAN NOT sleep in this wagon. The seats do not fold down to make a solid surface for the child to lay down in. This is a big factor for us because we bought the wagon to take the place of our stoller sometimes.I also bought the little extra wagon that is made to hook to the back of this one to pull a cooler or what ever. We have not used this for that yet but it does work good in our hallway pulling my son's toys."
5,Wagon for 2 fun,My 15 month old daughter loves this wagon. She puts her sippy cup in the holder and off we go!. She loves it when she has company and they can ride too!
3,Misleading Product Information,"We recently bought this wagon after researching online and in the store between this and other choices. I had heard some mention of plastic wheels, but the box said ""SOFT RUBBER TIRES"". I figured the updated model now had rubber tires. Got it home to find HARD PLASTIC tires!!! I called Step2 and they acknowledged that these are hard plastic tires but they said that there is rubber content in the plastic, hmmm. That seems like a reason to say ""SOFT RUBBER TIRES"" doesn't it?? I think they were purposefully trying to fool people. Anyway, I don't know if these new ""rubber"" tires will wear any better than the old plastic tires this used to come with. They claim these are better. I may not keep it just cause I feel swindled. May get a brand with rubber tires. Other than that, the door is hard to open, but at least there is one. They storage compartment doesn't have much room, but its better than nothing."
4,Great wagon for twin girls,"We received this as a gift when our kids were about 12 months. It is a great way to transport the kids from the car to the park, or take to farmer's market, or stroll along in the local 4th of July parade. The kids are 3 now and we still use it a lot (better than a stroller as they can see out easily and still feel like ""big kids."" I just have 2 complaints: (1) needs more foot room, as the girls are small for their age and both sets of feet do not fit in the middle (usually leads to lots of kicking and complaining!)and (2) the wheels could be better - it's difficult to maneuver the wagon over curbs."
4,Our sturdiest toy,"This wagon is great. Don't let the made for two fool you, the second seat is also a compartment which can be used to store toys and still as spacious as the one seater."
4,Deceptive marketing practices,"My husband and I specifically wanted a wagon with seating, cup holder and rubber tires. We chose the Wagon for Two by Step 2 since they advertise ""soft rubber tires"". I cannot describe my surprise when we opened the box for assembly and found hard plastic tires. A more truthful, clear description is indeed necessary regarding the tires. We are taking the product back-consumers are not really in the mood for this type of deception."
4,Poor Instructions,This wagon has and still is provided my twins with hours of enjoyment...They take turns pulling each other in it. It has made trips thru our neighborhood much more enjoyable. My only problem with it was the assembly instructions. On a scale of 1-10 I would rate the wagon a 9 but the instructions a 1. There are no written instructions only pictures with captions written in 3 languages... This is a very confusing way of doing things. I consider myself a very handy person however I found many flaws in the assembly and instructions or lack there of in this case...Parenting is hard enough the manufactures should make instructions clearer.
5,Love It!,"This wagon is awesome! Our daugher loves to climb in and go for a ride. We walk long distances with it and I am able to get as much if not more exercise than I did pushing her stroller. She enjoys being able to face forward or backward. We also purchased the tag along trailer and have found it quite useful for storing items when we are hauling two children. Assembly was a challenge, but was well worth the effort. The children sit deep enough in this wagon that I do not worry about them falling over the sides."
5,At Long Last!,"I had just about worn out my LPs and was starting to worry! It's odd how I find myself humming the classics---New Math, the Element Song, Pollution, etc. --- at odd moments. Even though the songs were topical in the '50-60s, many of them are still fresh today. There's the satire, but there's also a delightful sense of humor (New Math), with quite a lot of mayhem (Poisoning Pigeons). A true pleasure!"
