3,"Funny, but a bit juvenile","This had two things I like-jokes and pretty girls. However, execution of it was not that great. The comedians were not that funny, and it came across as sort of high schoolish. Thus my rating of 3 stars- average."
3,From Punk to Prep,"A good entry in a series of enjoyable books by Harkins, who excelled at putting us in the shoes of young people with a different or individualistic point of view. Here his lead character is a flashy City High halfback with a scholarship to a conservative rural prep school. Conflicts ensue over his attitude, his schoolwork and his long hair, but gradually his best qualities emerge in a transformation familiar to readers of Harkins books such as FIGHT LIKE A FALCON and DAY OF THE DRAG RACE."
4,Fun and addictive hobby!,"This DVD is very detailed and the host walks you through every step, with full demonstrations of all the techniques required for a project. Once you get started making AluMosaics, it's hard to stop!"
3,Ok...,"This is a nice industrial adaptation of some of Metallica's hits, from the slow paced intro ""Nothing Else Matters"" and ""Seek and Destroy"", hard hitting ""Fuel"", electronic-dance ""Master of Puppets"" and of course my favorite: ""Enter Sandman"". Some of the other songs aren't as good as theese. The really bad thing is the price here in amazon, it's way over the one I paid a few years ago in Wal-mart ($10), I didn't know this was an import. Try to find it cheaper elsewere."
1,Bad,"There is not one good song on this entire CD. Clearly a cash-in that, unfortunately, got my money. Do not buy this."
3,"The Band Is Great, Too Bad The Sound Quality Is Not!","I give 3 stars, only beause the recorded sound quality unfortunatly suffers. Whomever recorded this amazing band set the recorder too close to Rufus ""Speedy' Jones' drums and at times, all you hear are cymbals drowning out the band. The solo mic is okay and there are great perforamces by lead trumpeter Bill Chase and tenor sax man Sal Nistico. Herman alumni like Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, al Cohen & Gerry Mulligan join in the Jimmy Guffrie comp. The Four Brothers a.k.a. 'The Four Mothers.' & Getz is featured on 'Early Autumn'The recording would better suit a real Herman die hard fan of this particular era, if not seek 'Woody '63' or 'Woody's Winners/Jazz Hoot' for better recorded quality."
4,Hexaflexagons and Mathematical diversions,"This book is an amazing one and it is definetly recommended to the people who like math puzzles, games, or thought challenges. Also it is a great book to distract yourself. It is a book that you would like to keep in your shelf. Martin Gardner is a great writer and has other great books on many other different mathematical puzzles."
5,Master of New Age Music,"Is the only way to describe Sojiro. You don't just listen to his music, you feel it and become a part of it and it becomes a part of you. Kokoro is probably my favorite piece by him. I have some of his wonderful albums, Voyage and The Great Yellow River II being a couple of them and to a song they are all wonderful. I completely recommend Sojiro for anyone who loves New Age music."
3,I only learned one new bit of info,"If you read many books on Elvis,you find that there are several versions of many stories about Elvis.I found 99% of the information in this book is probably accurate.Only small differences that really are important only to a die-hard fan.Since I have been following his life since 1956,I remember the original press clippings and some things have been changed as the years go by and younger people write about him who were not there or even born yet and rely on word of mouth stories that may not be accurate."
5,Elvis Rocks:),"This book definetly satisfied the Elvis fascination in me. It was humorous, but also told some very interesting facts that I didn't have a clue about regarding The King.Informative and funny and very entertaining...sort of like Elvis himself!"
3,A Girl's Guide to Elvis,Arrived on time and in good condition. It was good in places and not so good in others. I liked it but I doubt I would go around recommending to everyone.
5,"What was new, now old","I bought this when it was originally released (I was 13) - on cassette. It was great at the time when it was new school, and is still great now that it is old school. Aaron Hall's vocals are so rich. The beat is non-stop and just puts you in a feel good mood all around. This is a great purchase. Just buy the thing."
4,A Really Good Follow-Up To Their First One.,"my favorite tracks are ""gotta be a leader"" ""The Future""."
2,so/so,"despite the importance of this group think r.kelly.jodeci,mary j bliege,dru hill,etc.. this album is not on par with the first disc.teddy is a great producer but a bad vocalist.he nearly ruined long gone.Aaron hall sounded strong.he hasn't had anything that has matched his guy days but his influence has continued.the grooves slipped on this disc.but the slow jams held up such as lets chill.hopefully the new one will get it right.however this disc is still better than blackstreets last one by a 100%."
4,"soul, r&b, new jack...yeah, it's all of those","I've read the other reviews The Future by Guy, and it makes me wonder if I was listening to a different cd. The instant it starts with Her, my head starts nodding and I'm right into it. This is one of those rare albums where I have to look long and hard to find something that I can't get into. Definatly, an album that stands the test of time."
3,The New Jack Swing Era Continues...,"Guy's sophomore effort reflects a lot about what the group had been through since the release of their self-titled debut in 1988. A couple of songs on this album express their views on the deterioration of their relationship with ex-manager Gene Griffin (Total Control, Gotta Be A Leader). The beats are harder, and the ballads are as good as ever. My favorite songs are ""Do Me Right,"" ""Let's Chill,"" and ""Teddy's Jam 2."" Subsequent songs showcase Aaron Hall's vocal skills and guests Aqil Davidson from Wreckx-N-Effect and Heavy D. If you're a true New Jack Swing fan, this is one to keep for The Future."
1,What Happened To Guy?,This cd is a disapointment compared to there last one. In This cd they try to be like rap artists. This cd just doesn't cut it for me.
5,Cute! Works Great!,"This can opener works just fine, and is comfortable to hold (though maybe a tiny bit bulky.) It's worth it because it's cute! I've had it for almost a year now, and it's going strong with no signs of breaking!"
1,Doesn't actually open cans....,"Having a love for kitschy kitchen utensils when my current, boring can opener broke i jumped on ordering this one. However due to the curving of the toucan ""beak"" you can't press the handles close enough together to get a tight enough grip on the can to open it. Sadly had to return and even more sadly purchased another plain, boring can opener. But at least it opens cans..."
1,Ashlay,"I love the style, but seriously the crappiest can opener i have ever bought. It won't do it's job at all. I hate to part with it because it makes me smile, but seriously Boston Warehouse, how dare you charge $15 for a can opener with form but no function? You should be ashamed."
3,Wish it lasted longer :(,"I've bought this can opener 2 times. The first one I had lasted less than a year. Thought I did something wrong and broke it. It just wouldn't turn anymore and I couldn't loosen it. So, I bought another one, thinking must be me. The second one has done the same thing. I'm so disappointed. I love this line and have many pieces. I just can't figure it out. If anyone has any suggestions, please post. Otherwise, I'll just have to use my very plain, very boring can opener."
2,very fun! the first one broke but my second is GREAT!,"I was soooo bummed that it broke. It was the cutest can opener I ever owned. I want to buy another one just so I can use it. It has a wonderfully comfortable handle. But after a few uses, it refused to cut the can. The wheel was too close to the other part and it wouldn't let me loosen it. I bought the tupperware one this time as we have gone through 3 openers since November. They are all made so cheap these days. Where is the quality control???I am adding to this review after I bought a second one. This one has not broken and I am so glad I bought a new one because its so cute!"
1,Perfect as a decoration in my kitchen drawer,"It's so cute! BUT...it doesn't work. It requires superhuman strength to apply the proper pressure in order to puncture the can lid all the way around. If you falter for even a millisecond, the opener will skip a spot, leaving you with a perforated (and incredibly sharp) can lid. Dangerous and not functional in the least. Form follows function FAIL."
2,Hard to use - Awful color,"I'm a fan of Boston Warehouse's Animal House products, and this can opener is not the only Animal House products I own. So, after buying the Toucan can opener, I gotta say that products of Boston Warehouse are a mixed bag of hit and miss.The ""beaks"" of this Toucan can opener are very hard to open/close. I have never owned a can opener that requires so much strength to separate or close the handles!See the shiny black head of the Toucan? Don't trust the photoshopped picture on Amazon. Scratches are everywhere on this can opener, so much that I suspected it was a used item. Speaking of not looking like pictured, the beautiful orange ""beaks"" of the opener is actually this awful brownish beige.I like the toucan design so much, but I had to return it because I couldn't stand how ugly and nonfunctional it was."
3,A bit different from his usual work,This isn't exactly a dissapointment but rather a different book from Turtledove. Obviously 20 years can take quite a difference. Notibly I found myself asking why Japan was not really involved. Also why didn't the Germans do anything about Spain. I figure if they helped Franco that they would have helped him again. All in all it is a good book. If you are into space aviation you might like it as well. The only thing he should put in this new series however is a Dramatics Persona of all the characters like the last one. Can't wait to see some sort of merchandising on this stuff!
1,Not again....,"To our misfortune, Mr. Turtledove is stretching things a bit thin. All this character development would be good if there was a payoff. As it is, the only payoff is to wait for the next book. I'm sure this is what the publisher had in mind (well, actually $$$ was foremost). I think we had a peek of what was to come when-during the WorldWar series-we were told of the NEXT series to come. I mean, write the story first, then worry about how many books in the series there will be. ITS TOO DRAWN OUT-BOREDOM IS SETTING IN. I love Turtledove and I'm not putting sole blame on him but WHERE'S THE MEAT!!??"
1,Boring and Repetitive,"This book keeps saying the same things over and over. Fans of the series will be sick over the over-development of characters yet at the same time a lack of any comprehensive plot development. Its like watching a soap opera. As for the art cover, why have Khomeini, Himmler, and Martin Luther King? None of the 3 appear at all, except Khomeini in passing. And why no development of top-level Nazi characters? Even Himmler's uniform on the cover lacks swastikas, which I'm sure a Nazi uniform would contain. Are we afraid of hurting the politically correct folks? We don't even get a good ""fleshing-out"" of Earl Warren, the US President! Come on Harry, you can do a whole lot better than this. Do I really need to spend another $30 on 4 or 5 more books? Spare me."
1,show me the money,"I enjoyed the first two Worldwar books but Turtledove just doesn't know when to stop flogging a dead horse. Colonization has no plot, no ending, no tension and no new ideas. His alien charcters rehash the plot so often that it seems the author is just ""cutting and pasting"" to fill space. Furthermore, his research is poor - Northern Irish people do not speak that way (if we get to hear them at all) Apparently they are all bigots who hate Jews only slightly less than eachother! These aliens are so stupid they would not be able to build starships. And why, if they have starships, do they not have more advanced weapons? The aliens also bear striking similarities to Harry Harrison's Yilane from the West of Eden series. Which is strange since Harrison also wrote Rebel in Time before Turtledove's Guns of the South.... Anyway, this is not alternate history as stated by many fans. It is pure Space Opera."
3,Keep' em coming harry!,"Interesting 4th novel in series..I'll keep my criticisms to myself..until I write a 500 pg novel... You're doin' great, Harry! Thanks"
3,Strangely addicting for lack of action and rehashing,"I have been a loyal fan of Turtledove and have read every book in the World War series. I have long since realized that he MUST rehash everything dozens of times and I have learned to live with it since the overall story is still good. With this one though it got a little extreme, some paragraphs almost word for word three times over. It lacks most of the intensity that made the first ones great but for some reason is still addicting. I'm off to go finish it up in right now. I just wish he could learn, after so many years of writing, that something said once is said enough. If you like the series you'll probably like this but this definately isnt a good book to start on, I doubt it would keep the interest of someone not already really into the series."
3,"Good sequel, but too many loose ends!","First, this book was vintage Turtledove with his interesting twist on how things familiar to us may have happened in a different reality. However, does this really need to occur over 3 books? For the amount I spent on this book, I expect to have at least some plots tied up. Tom Clancy knows how to use well developed characters and complete a story even if it takes 700 pages. There is just no reason why he couldn't have told this story in 1 book except for the money (or maybe ginger). Finally, what's with the cover? These figures have little, if any, connection to this story. From now on, I'll wait for the paperback."
1,I screwed up below,"Well, I gave a critical review below and messed up and gave the book 5 stars. THIS BOOK IS WORTH 3 STARS, so I have to give a one to even out the average. :) To reiterate, the BEST THING ABOUT THIS BOOK IS ITS ART COVER!!!"
2,"Disappointing, tedious, and dull","This book was a major disappointment. There is not much action. The few plot points are repeated over and over. The later third of the book starts to build to a climax, and then fails to deliver. There is no plot resolution. None. Perhaps the next book in the series may resolve the storylines started here, but I don't have the patience or interest to find out."
2,It could be great,"The story and people inside are great, marvelous. But Turtledove way of write it's so pitiful! Each time, in the book, come a caracther, he have to wirte down the same things as if was introducing to us, even at the end of the book!I felt so sad and offended by this kind of waste of paper and word.I?ve bougth the C, down to eart too, but I'l dont read it. I'll throw it in trash can."
2,I really wanted to like this but only got 50% of the way through before it bogged down,"While I like the overall concept of the World War and Colonization series and I have mostly enjoyed Turtledove's other efforts, I just couldn't get through this book. Somewhere around 45% of the way through the book a key discovery gets made about the Race and the effect of a certain earthbound spice. Great! This will make things interesting. Only it didn't. Because for the next 200 or so pages (I lost count) we are told about the effect over and over again in great detail. WE GET IT, OKAY? MOVE THE FRIGGIN' STORY ALONG. The story concept was good but the book could have been about a third of its size and been much, much better."
4,I like it,"I've got to admit I've always looked a bit askance at the Worldwar books, especially compared to his ""All-Human"" civil War and Great war novels. But after reading this one I've really been impressed by the way in which Turtledove weaves futuristic technology (atomic rockets, fuel-cell engines) into the material of the past (Ullhass and Ristin playing Spike Jones comedy records- a highlight). While I have no strong opinion on the question of Nazi aid to Britain (after 20 years of coexistance facing a common enemy, I think they would come to some sort of modus vivendi), I think the series is at its strongest in such scenes of alternate ""period detail"" like the aforementioned scene with the record, and the British nostalgia for Players cigarettes. At one point in the book, Sam Yeager mentions meeting John Wayne, for instance. What sort of war movies would Wayne have appeared in in this world? Would the Beav shave his head and wear body paint?"
2,A rather sad follow up to his excellent 'World War' series.,"After his excellent 'World War' series the first of the next series is a huge disappointment. It lacks the pace and urgency of his earlier books. It is so obvious that the book is the first of a series, it is almost as if we have no right to expect anything from it in itself. It is simply readying the reader for later books and developments, I felt the best story lines were being held back for later in the series. That does seem a little unfair, I want action now!"
3,Good continuation of the World War series,"This book is for those who read Turtledove's World War series, liked the idea of an Alien invasion during WWII, and wanted to know what happened next. I'd say it is unlikely that we would have progressed so quickly with captured technology but on the whole this book is an entertaining way to spend time."
3,"Decent Book, but....","Turtledove's alternate history/science fiction books are always a good read, but this series is getting too played out. The incorporation of new and old characters is good, but the plot is almost transparent with few surprises. Maybe they will come in later novels."
3,"Not bad, but been there, done that, got the t-shirt","I'll be blunt, I mightily disliked the first series, mostly because of the really shoddy treatment one of the characters received at the hands of his own family. So here we are, 17 years later, and the Lizard females have arrived to stir the pot. Turtledove handles the development of a partially alien-occupied earth well, and the characters and situations are believable. Not a bad read, but I *wish* Turtledove would stop re-fighting the two ugliest wars history has ever seen and go on to something new."
4,Good Book,"If I could I would give it four and a half stars. A good continuation of the world war series. So Turtledove wants to make money by writing sequels. Fine if they are as good as this one. I applaud him for having a map this time. If you liked the worldwar series you should like these too. As a historian, like Turtledove, I appreciated his views on historical figures under unusual (alien occupation) conditions. My only criticism is about the U.S. space station. Way too predictable, its true purpose is evident early on to people with half a brain. But overall engaging and worth it, even in hardcover."
4,Winning isn't Victory...at all.,"I almost feel sorry for Atvar; the Fleetlord of the Invasion fleet. He's over his head when dealing with Humans (Big Uglies) and is just beginning to realize it. He's seeing his conquest disintegrate while the new arrivals of the Colonization fleet are upset over not having everything as expected when they left Home.He's right in one respect; eventually Tosev 3 (Earth) will enter the Empire, but most likely on its own terms.The story is well done in showing how some things appear to be universal when it comes to relations between different people, and how a ""Decent life"" is more a matter of opinion than a matter of fact.Well done!"
3,To Read or Not to Read....,I've now read all three of the WorldWar books and thefirst installment of the Colonization saga. I'll probablynot continue reading the series unless I can borrow thebooks or pick them up at a 1/2 price book store.Too little depth in the writing. Too little characterdevelopment. Tries to cover too much in too littlespace. Seems to be written for the 12-15 year old crowd.
2,"Kill this series, pluh-ease!","I had the mis-opportunity to read an advance copy of ""Second Contact"". It was okay, but in the end, all I can say is, ""So what?""The problem seems to be that Turtledove has caught ""series-itus"", and is now trying to stretch a story that would have made a couple good novels into 7 or 8 volumes (the original Worldwar series plus the Colonization series of which this is volume 1). Maybe it's his fault; maybe it's the publisher's. Who cares?Thus, while good ideas abound, there is so, so much padding that you just want to shout, ""Get on with it!"" Unfortunately, he doesn't, and so we will have to wait for another book or two for the story to be concluded. Don't know about you, but I just don't see enough here to make it worth my while to look for the sequel(s).So... if you're looking for good alternate history form Turtledove, I really suggest you get his (single-volume) ""Guns of the South""."
5,Pricey but worth it!,I begged for the product for my birthday and when my husband got it for me I was so happy!!!! It works like a charm. No need for photo glue sticks or the little tape guns. Just crank and stick. Its that easy!
1,"Good for a short while, then...","I've only had this vacuum for 6 months - yes I bought it for appx $60 at Walmart - and after 6 months, it has lost about 80-90% of its suction power. Everytime I want to get a GOOD vacuum in, I have to dismantle the frame under the bottom, as well as the hose and clean it out (carpet fuzz, etc). Everything clogs up in these spots, and even cleaning them out, the suctioning power is so weak that it gets clogged again almost immediately. I at first thought maybe the carpet fuzz was the sole culprit, but thinking about it more, if the suctioning was the same as when it was bought, all this fuzz would be in the trash bin to be dumped out, and not at the beginning of the hose area. Even though it was only $60, I can't help but think that it couldv'e been a $60 investment towards a really good vacuum that could last years instead of only months."
1,Really Does Not Suck,It's awful! It gets clogged too easily and it is very hard to get working again. Ive taken it apart twice and it is just frustrating. Ive owned this vacuum for about a year and I am looking for something worth my money.
1,don't bother,"I don't recommend this product at all. It worked for a period of about 5 months and despite cleaning the filters on a regular basis it became hopelessly clogged. You get what you pay for. Next time I will buy a better, more expensive machine instead of waiting money on these cheapo things that just end up in a landfill somewhere."
1,Dirt Thrower,"This vacuum is loud and throws dirt back at your legs. Also, because it is soo light weight it tips over when you use the arm. I tried it three times and each time had to go back and sweep. That's sad. Also, the filter system does clog easily, and is very messy to clean. This product is a waste of money!"
2,Bissell not blissful.,I purchased the Bissell Powerforce bagless vacuum after my Kenmore of 1-1/2 year clogged but required a greater price for repair than the value of the vacuum. Originally the Bissell was very easy to work with and easy to use. After a month I began to have problems with the cord not staying attached towards the top of the vacuum causing the cord to always be in the way and wrapped around my hand. The bagless system is extremely dirty. I emptied the debris into a bag to keep the dust from getting all over the place which defeats the use of a bagless vacuum. The suction is not very good. I would never recommend this for cleanup of pet hair. After several passes over the same areas multiple times and still find dirt and pet hair. I would say its equivalent to sweeping carpet. The Bissell only picks up visual surface debris. Don't waste your money or time dealing with this vacuum.
2,belt broke after first use,"I loved this vacuum the first time I used it! The turbo brush is great. It's relatively light-weight. But, the second time I went to use it, there wasn't good suction. We looked under and the roller wasn't turning. We opened it up to find the belt was broken...after only 1 use!!!! We're taking it back. I'm bummed, because I did like it. I read reviews about this belt problem BEFORE I bought it, took a chance, and it happened to me too. Bummer."
3,Bissel Powerforce Bagless Turbo,"I have Had one for 2 Years.Model #6585 Good Suction Lighter then most. Filters need cleaned often , Breaks belts easy and fast when something gets cought in brush. Walmart sells this for $65.00 ,no mistake go online and look... Newer model Dual cyclonic way better."
1,dont buy if you have animals,This vacume was bought about 6 months ago from wal mart who dont take them back after 90 days. we use it once a week and pet hair gets caught in the bearings of the beater bar where you can not get to to clean causing it to melt and freeze up causing the belt to break. Bissel has replaced it three times now free of charge but when they say enough is enough or wont replace it with a different model then it goes in the dumpster. there is a 1yr warrenty on this but the beater bar is not covered. luckly enough i have gotten them to warrenty it. but its messy dumping the bagless part. works good when it works. but the beater bar only lasts about 3 to 4 uses at around 15 to 20 min run time. Cant wait to toss it and get a different brand
3,Great at first...but it won't last.,"Like everyone else, I raved about this vacuum at first. But over a year later, I'm changing my tune. This thing *constantly* breaks down. We've had to replace the belt and filters, and I've taken it apart and put it back together more times than I can count because some part or another wasn't working. Maybe this is what you get when you pay less than $100 for a vacuum, but I definitely expected this thing to be more resilient and dependable, especially given how great it worked in the beginning. What a disappointment."
2,A Pain in the Rear!,"I have had this vacum for about a year. I empty the cup with each use, and I have cleaned the filters regularly. Cleaning the filters is very messy, a matter a fact emptying the cup is pretty messy too. I live on the top floor in a apartment building, so it is difficult to get this outside to clean it. Cleaning it, and emptying the cup into a trash bag inside creates more of a mess and layer of dust/dirt than I had before I started cleaning. It started loosing power pretty quickly even with regular maintance. The belt breaks on a regular basis. I am currently looking for a new vacum that does not have these issues."
1,not good for dog hair,"Bought this 10 weeks ago and dog hair keeps getting stuck under the belt and around the silver axle. It doesn't suck much of the hair to the filter because it gets under the belt stays there, makes awful noises after which you must take the entire thing apart. I vacuum every other day. In 10 weeks, I have had to take the bottom plate off, the belt off and clean the underneath 5 times and that is ridicules. Yes, I empty the dirt container and clean the filters too. So this is not at all a good machine for dog hair. My money thrown away. I bought it because my daughter has one and loves it but she has no pets. I guess it's good on regular dirt. Don't waste your money if you have pets that shed."
3,"ORCHESTRA STRONG, POLLINI SLEEPY","One man's view: Pollini is a great artist, a master. He can play all the notes in these works. That's a feat in itself. But he just never connects with me in the heart-of-heart. I don't feel deep commitment here. Frustrating! Because the orchestra seems to kick out real energy. Personally, I'd go for Brendel on piano. He plays with that extra something--a lightness of touch; agility; fluidness; and subtle passion! Maybe give him a listen...."
3,Why are they tip-toeing through Beethoven?,"It would be easy to give up on the Beethoven piano concertos. One almost never hears a performance as committed as it needs to be. Pianists and conductors barely rehearse them, relying on these thrice-worn works to receive knee-jerk approval from the audience no matter how dull and routine the performance may be.In the case of Pollini and Abbado, like Perahia and Haitink before them, these are refined, sanitized readings. Everything is ""classically"" in place, without smudges--or interest. Both are great artists, and despite the reputation their Beethoven concertos have for being a mite cool and conventional, I expected more than this. At best we have a civilized run-through, at worst an act of emotional neglect. Pollini actually tinkles his way through the sublime Fourth Concerto! Sigh."
3,Strong glue smell,"Good quality speaker boxes, they came on time, well packaged but like MOST speaker boxes they have a strong odor of glue so if you're sensitive, you might want to consider letting them dry more in a dry spot before installing it in your enclosed sealed vehicle"
3,If not for one thing....,"The book was progressing wonderfully for me, until the author admitted dumping two old pets because it wasn't ""convenient"" for her to have them anymore because she was going to ""sail away."" One cat went to an almost certain demise at an animal shelter, another disappeared after being relocated to the woods at a relatives house.Sailing away can be a very fulfilling way to experience life. But we are already such a throw away society, I cannot condone her actions. If great care can be taken to sell off possessions at garage sales, could not the same care have been taken with finding GOOD homes for two old companions?Shame on Rae Ellen Lee. I will not be finishing the book.Margaret"
1,Expected more,"I was really disappointed with this book. We are purchasing a sailboat to live aboard and I have been reading books to help convince me this is a good thing. :-) I have read many excellent books about cruising and living aboard but this book in not one of them. The author seems to be a miserable person who hates sailing. I really didn't need to know about her troubled marriage. It was a downer...I started feeling very sorry for her husband. It would be interesting to know if she is still sailing. If you are looking for a book that has a good narrative along with useful information for coping on a sailboat, this is not it."
2,Product Support is Essential!,"I recently purchased Rosetta Stone Spanish from Amazon.com. I was initially delighted by the product and its approach to learning a new language. I then started having problems. I realized that an essential part to writing Spanish is the inverted question mark at the beginning of every question. I could not determine a way to make this symbol and I contacted Rosetta Stone Support via the internet and via telephone. I was amazed to learn that the normal level of support could not solve my problem and was told I would have to talk to a supervisory level. I was finally contacted by supervision 4 days later. In the meantime, I decided that this was not going to work and returned the product to Amazon."
4,"Rosetta Stone, a language teaching tool, requires commitment.","You have to commit to this program, at LEAST 2 hours a day, or you won't learn anything. If you are commited to learning a new language and have the time to sit down with the program, Rosetta Stone is a great way to go. There is no english at all throughout the program~ You will have to use a translation method if you don't understand the meaning of a word by the clues/pictures provided.Grab a pen and paper, memorize, speak, and learn a new language."
4,So far going well,"In lesson 1-9 and so far enjoying it. I find that I have to disengage my brain a little bit after the lessons to think back in English. I have found it helpful already not to read as the words are being spoken but close my eyes and then try to associate the phrase with the picture.Also, before you purchase this, check with your local library. I am using this free right now with my library's online system."
1,rosetta stone suppost stinks!,"What? After 2 years of working well...suddenly it doesn't. What happened? Call support and someone in India tries to SELL me an upgrade. Then they say they can't help me unless I pay $19. I'll have to live chat for help. That's after 20 minutes of waiting and giving information. PS.. while I'm live chatting and waiting on them, I'm writing this review. $500 and no respect."
4,Rosetta Stone,Rosetta Stone V3 Spanish (Latin America) Level 1-2-3 Personal Edition (Win/Mac)I have the PC Windows version. The software is fantastic but the microphone will not adjust volume with the pc therefore I am left with wearing it behind my ears because the sound is too loud.
4,muy fabuloso,"This is a very good product, I've already learned so much. I didn't realize it was a total immersion program, some translation would be nice but they use so much repetition that I can eventually tell what it means.I really do enjoy it, I go to Mexico on medical missions trips, which is why I got this. So now I'm even more excited to go to see how much I really did learn :)"
1,PUT ME ON THE LONG LIST OF DISAPPOINTED PEOPLE,"Because a dear friend has had a wonderful experience with the French version of Rosetta Stone, I dismissed the negative reviews regarding this product. BIG MISTAKE.Like some of the others here, my discs were not shrink wrapped and I wondered if they had been used before... Nevertheless, the installation was fairly simple and ""by the book"" - until the program simply refused to open due to ""minor errors"" that were not detailed in any of the user manuals (and just try to get a human being on the weekend). I can't even get to a window to deactivate the product - that's their problem.I'm not stressing over it - it's going back to Amazon. Considering the cost of the program, I don't feel I should knock my head against the wall because of an inferior product that refuses to work as promised. Berlitz here I come."
3,"Good, but not Great","This is a reasonable tutorial for (my choice) Spanish, but I think the designers focused too much on flash and not enough on pedagogical content. The presentation is fine and you can learn much from it. It's just that it isn't as good as some people seem to believe. I think that the Pimsleur audio tapes (3 volumes), although old school in approach, are still the best Spanish learning tool available."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH 64 BIT VISTA,"Rosetta Stone has a great product. Do not buy from Amazon as they are not a certified Rosetta Stone seller and you will not get the 6 month warranty. It took Rosetta Stone 4 months to figure out that I had a 64 bit Vista system and that is not compatible. Regular 32 bit vista is. I was very disappointed with Amazon on this, not Rosetta Stone--it is a good product and really works. I recommend buying this directly from Rosetta or from a certified seller on E Bay otherwise you are out a bunch of money like me and even with a re sale on Amazon, they ended up pocketing another $50 bucks! I will personally never buy electronics or software again from Amazon."
1,Korean is a bad idea,"My wife and I bought Rosetta Stone because of the six month guarantee. We called the company directly and the help person told us to keep trying, ""you've got six months to return it."" We finally gave up and turned toward another program that works better and called Rosetta Stone to return/refund. Not only did they not guarantee it for six months, there was NO guarantee at all through the company because ""you purchased it through Amazon or other retailer.""Only thanks to Amazon's extended holiday return policy were we lucky enough to get in under that wire and return this product that didn't work for us at all! (The program does not Romanize the words, but uses the Korean characters.) Hope this helps."
4,great item,I bought this for my husband because he wanted to learn a new language. It is so easy to learn that we have the whole family involved.
4,excellent product,"This is a great piece of software. I only have completed the first unit and half of the second, but I fell in love with the pedagogy immediately. It is thorough and extremely well put together, and really a lot of fun to use. Only downside is the cost; it is worth the price, for sure, but it's a big investment. I had difficulty with the startup the second time I fired it up, and the telephone tech support was efficient and helpful.Highly recommended."
4,Pretty good product,The product is the best I've used but it can be a little confusing. One part of the program is matching words or sentences to pictures and in some of them you can't always figure out what they are saying. The program I have is all in Spanish and there is no place to get a translation if you want it. Other then that it is a great product. I have only had it for a month and have learned a lot.
1,Unable to review Rosetta Stone Spanish V3.,"The seller I purchased this from sent a bootleg copy, so I am unable to comment."
3,Has some flaws,"I have mixed emotions about this heating tray. I like the big surface (one of the primary things I was looking for). The problem is that it's temperature range is somewhat limited - it is either too hot or not hot enough with no intermediate setting. (When the temperature knob is turned past a certain point, the temperature suddenly jumps about 100 degrees). It also has trouble maintaining a consistent temp when cold things are put on it. When I put a cold dish on the tray, instead of warming the food, the food cools off the tray, which then can take hours to heat up the food. While it does work nominally (thus the 3 stars), I must say that it isn't the best warming tray I've ever seen."
3,Not my top choice.,A rather annoying drawback is the length of the cord which is only 2.5 feet. Nor is the cord detachable. Was the designer's mind on vacation? And the brushed stainless steel surface does not wear too well - it spots and scratches easily.
2,Mantak Chia in Twicken Form,"Ok...I love Mantak Chia...sometimes.With everything you learn, there's both good and bad.This book is good if don't know anything about Qigongor you think you know something because you read anotherbook 10 years ago about it.Some diagrams, some I Ching charts...the writer had goodintent, but you just didn't do all that in this book Mr Twicken.Also, HE REVIEWED HIS OWN BOOK????!!!I don't like giving bad reviews to good books.But I also don't give good ones to bad books either.I have books on QiGong that I will happily recommendnot this one.SorryBless"
4,Thumbs up!,"Purchased this to go with the Roman soldiers...I wouldn't notice a difference but 6 - 9 year old little boys do. This guy's helmet seemed to make quite an impression compared to the ""soldiers"" helmets. I had to do some research to answer questions for my sons about the centurions and and the Roman army so we all learned something new. I don't like the little accessories but apparently they do. Keeping everything together is a challenge but all pieces are very durable. My sons love these guys and continue to add to their collection."
4,MORE MATURE?,"I have always loved this Keel CD. Nice production. A definite must have for fans of the band. The songwriting is a bit more mature than the previous two albums. I felt like the band lagged somewhat after this release. Highlights are: THE FINAL FRONTIER, ROCK AND ROLL ANIMAL, ARM AND A LEG, NO PAIN NO GAIN."
5,WOW!,"I remember when this came out, I'd never heard them before & I found the tape in the road.. lol.. Wound it back up & listened to it..I became a true fan & I am still to this day !!!I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!!! LOVE IT!!!"
5,Lo vercheck,"I love this Cd, I owned it when I was in high school, however I have lost it. I even did my ballet solo in my SR. dance recital to one the songs off of this album. I really would like to buy this CD again since I lost my first copy. However, I can not find it anywhere. If anyone knows where I can find a copy to buy, I would be forever grateful.Thank You,Julie Lovercheck"
3,unexceptional,"Does what it claims to do. Stays put reasonably well in a Thinkpad Expresscard/54 slot (some /34 cards wiggle a lot). But provides even less USB power than the onboard Thinkpad USB controller, which is itself pretty anemic. (In theory the Expresscard spec allows 1W per card, which should allow this two-port card to provide almost the full 500mW per port allowed by USB. This card provides so little power my USB-powered drive can't even begin to spin up, let alone spin up completely.)"
1,Not what I hoped for,"This seems to have issue recognizing some devices, such as my Western Digital external hard drives and my iPod, even though the USB would show up in the device manager. I tried every trick and it would not work. I returned it and got a replacement, but that replacement had the same issue. the hardware manufacturer's techs could not resolve the issue either."
5,I love them,"I have an old Yamaha and a Guild 12 string. I keep both in concert tuning which is why i use these strings. The phosphor has a slightlymore mellow tone than the standard bronze. Yes the sound with the lighter strings can be a bit thiner, but keeping it in standard tuning and putting approximately 40- 50 Lbs less pull on the neck ( compaired to 10-52's ) is worth it to me. At this price i can change the strings as they are REALLY needed."
5,Terrific tale,"I've read and re-read this book three or four times over the last 20 years. It's a first-rate story in the genre of human castaway civilizations, one of the most imaginative studies of alternative civilization structures I've ever run across. The author has a sure grasp of narrative structure and dialog, and his characters are both varied and appealing. I've never heard that it won any awards, which is surprising; it's easily the equal of most Hugo or Nebula winners."
2,Good to read during an oil change,"While the author takes some interesting stabs at developing the main character, the overall plot is stupid and unbelievable. After being strung along for most of the book with the librarian's obsessive crush on a conductor, the resolution of this plot line smacks of a lazy imagination. This is not a terrible book. It's more like a book you might keep in the car to have something to read if you're waiting in line at the car wash or one of those oil change places."
3,Easy read with a fun twist...,"I really didn't know what to expect when I picked up this book but I ened up being pleased that I read it, though not willing to recommend that one purchase it. The main character, Ally, was well-developed and quite witty. I enjoyed reading about her relationships with the other characters, especially the twist in relationships as they developed. The mystery in this book kept me turing the pages, as well as the desire to see if the librarian would find love in the end..."
1,No Better Than a Cheesy Romance,"I couldn't agree more with ""A reader from New York USA""; this is truly one of the worst books I've ever read. I've noticed similar books to this displayed in Target, Borders, and Spag's, but have never really looked at them. Being a librarian, I was taken in by the charming title and the promise of laughs. I realized, however, half way through the book that I was no longer charmed and had not laughed once (and the prospect for doing so did not look good). Vapid! Vain! Moronic! Those are just some of the words to describe this work. How is trying to break up a marriage (especially when it's not your's) funny? Truthfully, if I was a graduate of Bryn Mawr, I'd be insulted. Don't waste your time or money on this ""book"" (and I use the term loosely)."
5,Such a fun read!,I absolutely love this book. I couldn't wait to see what would happen. This author is one of my favorites because she has such an amazing talent for writing!
4,Of course I loved this book...I'm a librarian,"C'mon. I can't be expected to judge this book fairly.Give me a break. The book is set in a library. The main character (as well as most of the other characters in the book)is a librarian. The author, for heaven's sake, dedicates the book to her mother, ""the paragon of a passionate librarian""; in the acknowledgements, the author encourages her readers to ""continue to honor the extraordinary literary heritage found in our free library system and the librarians who help us discover its enduring wealth"".If you are a librarian, you can't help but love this book. File this book under 020 for Libraries, 306.7 for Romance."
4,Laugh out loud funny,"I am a librarian and I loved it. It was, in lots of wonderful places, laugh out loud funny. Just like a Lucy show. Most of what was going on was not plausible at the superb Philadelphia Public Library, but that was not the point. The stereotypes were to give you the idea of the situation without a great deal of description and most librarians and library users could easily picture the characters and situations: staff interactions, Ed-the homeless patron and the exciting tidbits of everyday lives with books, reference questions and historic documents. Fiction does not have to meet anyone's standard of real to be good! I was tickled with the ending!"
2,Silly rather than funny,I thought the comedic episodes in the book were contrived and really not funny -- not at all the way a person would actually act. A decent read for a rainy afternoon.
3,"a few funny moments, but pretty shallow","This was a fun and silly book in some ways, the kind you occasionaly read just for fun. I also appreciated reading about the personal life of a librarian since I am a librarian myself. Ally is basically a fun character to read about. But sometimes the characters' lack of depth kind of ruined the book for me. The whole scene between Lou and Ed towards the end was completely contrived and cheesey and seemed really out of place in the story. And the end of the book was very abrupt and a little lame. It just kind of fizzled out. All in all, it's a fun little book, but don't go looking for a good plot or in-depth characters."
1,Needs a fact checker,"This book is filled with inaccuracies about Philadelphia and the institutions portrayed. Maybe this isn't important if you're a reader living somewhere else, but as someone reading the book in Philadelphia, these errors made me cringe! At one point, the author has her protaganist follow the conductor's wife from the Parkway to 52nd Street and back on foot -- that's over 6 miles and all during a lunch break! Restaurants appear in the wrong places, roads run in the wrong directions, buildings are mistakely named, etc. Additionally, both the Free Library and Philadelphia Orchestra (oops, I mean Philharmonic) appear to be run as part-time hobbies by about three staff members each. Too much is factually wrong with this book to be overcome by its thin plot."
2,Really?,"Ally is not a librarian! She has the system on her wall and may be head of reference, but does she ever work? And how in the world does she have only six emails. Anyway, the character is shallow, undeveloped, and drives a convertible, drinks martinis, but wears up to the neck ""librarian"" blouses and no sex for 14 years. Unbelievable. Waste your time if you have a VERY boring and LONELY rainy day inside, otherwise, I would recommend a better written Romance Novel or fun read. I would rather read about my life as a librarian. Much more interesting."
4,Love and lust at the library,"This was a light, enjoyable book about a librarian who hasn't had sex in 15 years. Flitting around her periphery are Gordon, her handsome, womanizing boss, and Aleksi, the intriguing music conductor. The librarian gets sucked into a web of intrigue involving the music conductor's sudden interest in her library's collections and the conductor's wife study of poisons, supposedly for a novel she's writing.The writing was a little weak and the pacing dragged a bit, but there was something charming and endearing about it, kooky as it was. I think most bibliophiles and library lovers would like it."
4,"Lively, Funny & Entertaining","Josephine Carr's The Dewey Decimal System of Love is an entertaining and quick read as the book is just impossible to put down. The reader just cant wait to find out what happens next.Very well written in the first person, our single and celibate heroine, a research librarian, falls in love, or is it lust, with a symphony conducter. To further complicate the matter, she believes she has stumbled onto a plot by the conductor's wife to murder him.The plot is well written, the dialogue crisp and convincing, and the characters well developed. I loved this book and look forward to the sequel (please).If you are looking for serious literature, you may be disappointed, but for a lively, quick read, a fun read, a humorous read, this book is the real deal."
5,"Truly a classic, should be mandatory reading for children","I first stumbled accross this book many years ago, when i was 10. At that time, the book seem extremely thick and it was in Vietnamese, even though i read a lot, this book was so special to me, that i never forget the story. It is a very simple plot, but with amazing skill, the author made it a wonderful book to read, while some of the concept are very basic, it also promote peace, among all living things, not just human, promote awareness of the nature that surrounded us, and it will no doubt help many young boy to grow mentally, make them more mature and more understanding to other. Now, at age 20, 10 years after reading this book, i finally found the book again, in an English version, this book surely will help to cheer anyone up through a rainy day (perfect time to sit and read this book). Buy it for yourself, or your kid, they will love it."
5,A lovely gift to new parents,"My grandmother gave me this book when I had my first child. It's the loveliest, funniest, most imaginative story, and I've already begun to relate it to my son. It simultaneously frustrates and delights me that this story exists. Frustrates because I wish, so badly, that this quality of entertainment was made readily available to children nowadays, instead of the frenetic, crass garbage in the theaters. But, I'm delighted that this book is still in print and translated for the whole world of children to read.There is a company called Three Sisters who make a mobile for babies that is based on the legend of Nils. I purchased the mobile and this book for a friend who just had a little boy."
1,PAPERBACK BOOK!,"I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my Irish son-in-law. I was shocked, surprised, and embarrassed when I discovered it is a PAPERBACK book. It never occured to me that a $40 book would not be a hardback, properly bound book worth keeping."
4,Great Character Study,"Very interesting and exciting take on ""Tarantino-esque"" flicks. This new film, by an up and coming production team, will draw in the viewer from the start. Several of the actors stand out for their intense and hilarious performances. This one is surely for ""filmers"", and not for the whole family, but if you are looking for something original and off-beat, check this flick out..."
3,Lab Notes,"A nice pocket size with good information. Would be more helpful to students if ""causes"" of high or low values were included."
4,good product but....,"This product is good but I think it would be greatly improved if it had the indications listed under abnormal resullts. I does explain the lab tests, how they are done & what they detect but not the indications of an abnormal lab. I still found it useful in the clinical setting esp when it isnt a routine lab."
3,"It's hokey, but it's Buck","This serial should have been cut from 15 chapters to, maybe, ten. The acting was atrocious, the comedy was lame, the segues from chapter to chapter, and even within chapters, was herky-jerky. The explanatory blurbs between chapters must have been written by a 10 year old. Not a lot of care was taken in this production.Buck Jones is one of my favorites, but he didn't look like he was having a lot of fun delivering some of the lines that were written for him. Raymond Hatton should have stuck with his taciturn characterization that he was so good at in the Rough Riders and other series. The writers had him delivering lines that were completely inane.The cliff hangers were ludicrous; at the end of a chapter a half ton of rocks drops on our hero's head and in the beginning of the next chapter, Buck gets up and dusts himself off.The villain was laughable. The bad guys were all over the place. It was like watching a Chinese firedrill.I give it three stars because of Buck Jones."
2,Father's Day,"I picked up Father MC's ""Father's Day"" used for a couple dollars. And that's really all that you should pay for it.The first two songs were quite popular and were minor hits back in the day. They are good examples of the New Jack swing/hip-hop that only lasted a couple of years. However, after the first couple of songs, it quickly falls off.I remember having this album back when it came out. I wasn't thaaaat into it even back then. Sorry Father MC, this one hasn't aged nicely."
4,Battle Rig Blaster Review,We bought this for our 4 year old and it took him about a week to learn how to transform it himself. If you are a 4 year old you have to pull it really hard to make it transform from the truck to the gun. Otherwise he has had hours of fun playing with it. I would also recommend to buy extra nerf darts because they do get lost easily. I think that it only comes with 3 or 4 darts.Hasbro Transformers Optimus Prime Battle Rig Blaster
4,fun...but heavy for little arms,"First of all....the price on this toy is crazy! This toy is worth about $25. So if it's over that....keep price checking! It's a very durable toy. Very easy to transform from truck to gun. Heavy for small children. I am not sure of the age range, but my 3 year old had a hard time using his brother's (who is 5). Fun toy overall."
4,Don't expect this one to sound like the rest,"I guess that the best way I could describe this record is by saying that it is The Call stripped down to a bare bones sound. It is probably as close as they wanted to get to making an ""unplugged"" record. It took a while for me to get used to this record. They took the music in a very different direction as compared to 'Reconciled' and 'Into the Woods'. It has a much more organic feel. The highlight of the record for me, the song I want to listen to over and over again is ""Floating Back"". That song and ""This is Your Life"" are the most energetic songs. Most of the other songs have slower tempos. I like all of the songs on Red Moon but I have to admit that some of the slower songs are not so easy to like. Just takes a little time to appreciate them as they are."
5,An Excellent Resource!,"This volume is amazing. When I first read it, I couldn't put it down. It explains the philosophy of the ransom in such a clear and concise way, one wonders why so many theologians today complicate it with their convoluted reasoning. The chapter titled ""A ransom for All"" is excellent and is worth the book alone!"
2,Reconditioned = some parts may be missing,"I bought this toaster for about $11, so I did not expect much. I haven't tried it yet, so I can't say how it works, but I want to warn potential buyers that if you buy a reconditioned item, it can come with some parts missing. Mine came without a cookie sheet and a little thingie for pulling hot trays out. Also, the dials are somewhat misaligned. Not a big deal, especially given the price, but had I bought it for more money, I would've been pissed."
5,Commenting on Loose Ends album,"I am a die hard Loose Ends fan and Look How Long has got to be the best album yet. The others only had a few good hits, but this one really gets into your soul. Every song has a true meaning and is the ultimate in smooth laid back listening. I have purchased this album 5 different times because i can't seem to get enough of it. I actually have purchased all the albums. One thing to the group, please don't making songs I really love your music."
3,Indeed look how long & still going strong,"Arguably the best album,track for track by Loose Ends.The Look how long album was the long awaited final album. The line up on this album had changed but all the production, soul and Jazz was still there.This album was a fitting farewell that broke our hearts and our dancing shoes. It serves as on of the sound tracks to my life and a bench mark album that must be bought. It is simply UK soul at its best with something to dance to,cry to,sing to and think to. My only regret is that we will never see or hear the likes of Loose Ends again or will we ???God bless Loose Ends"
4,The Beginning of the End....,"Jane Eugene and Steve Nichol were gone but Carl McIntosh still managed to forge ahead with a new Loose Ends into the 90s. This album was released after the revolution in music brought about by Soul II Soul and McIntosh blended the old with the new brilliantly, although, out of all Loose Ends albums, ""Look How Long"" has the least staying power. Still, the classics culled from this album are such because they use the trademark Loose Ends formula. ""Don't Be A Fool"", ""Look How Long"" and especially ""Cheap Talk"" all sound as good as the stuff from the group's mid-80s heyday, while ""Don't You Ever Try to Change Me"" and ""Symptoms of Love"" prove that, in many ways, McIntosh can be a star in his own right, which he more or less was with the other two original members gone. Even though not as great as the previous two releases, it ""Look How Long"" still left Loose Ends fans wanting more...of Carl, at least."
3,Okay but...,"It definitely has the hit ""Let's Wax A Fatty"", which is being played in just about every club all over the world...and you wouldn't even know it until you hear on here."
4,A classic Smooth R&B CD,"Loose Ends created some timeless international R&B music. Along with the Chimes and Soul to Soul, R&B has suffered with the loss of these groups. Get this CD if you like some quality music and vocals."
3,An average effort.,"This release from Loose Ends was a let down compared to the previous releases. With personel changes (gone was the alluring vocals of Jane Eugene and supporting musician Steve Nichol), this effort had fans wondering, Where WAS the original Chucki Boo (a previous smash album, well worth your time). The lead single ""Don't Be A Fool"" had glimpes of past brillance, but for the most part the tracks seemed to be rushed and over produced. I heard a rumor that the group was reuniting and hopefully, this can happen. In the meantime, Zagora,"" which features the club hit ""Slow Down,"" along with the cuts ""Sweetest Pain,"" ""Stay A Little While,"" and ""I Can't Wait"" are more than worth your time."
1,A very flawed presentation of the Catholic faith,"With charity to the author, many of the arguments he makes in this book are simply heretical. Among others things he claims:Adam and Eve didn't really existAbraham didn't really existSome Protestants really do have the True Presence in their ""communion services""Pope Leo XIII was wrong, Anglicans really do have valid orders and apostolic successionHumane Vitae was wrong, and the Church only condemns contraception because it refuses to treat lay people as grown upsIn short, the book is simply very bad theology and at odds with the Catholic faith. I pray that the author has reconsidered his positions since writing it. The only sense in which I could recommend it, is to someone who wants an example of the mainstreaming of modernist heresy within many elements of the Church.Pax"
1,Absolutely HORRIBLE Display,"I received a picture of the flowers sent to a sick friend and was HORRIFIED! It was a bunch of flowers, definitely NOT a bouqet! It looks as is somebody purchased the flowers from the grocery store and put them in a Dollar Store vase. Words cannot describe how disappointed I am!!!"
5,"Very, very satisfied","Exceptional service. Seller contacted me after I ordered to get suggested times for delivery and to provide the opportunity to include a gift card and a message. The email I received from my wife after the flowers arrived (in just ONE day!) says it all: ""Thank you for the flowers, they are soooo beautiful!!! They are bright and colorful with some unusual blooms, just my style!"" I will order from this seller again."
5,Flower bouquet,"I hesitated in ordering these. I was wrong these were great. I ordered one for my mother and one for my wife, they both loved them. This bouquet is BETTER than advertised and worth every penny."
4,Very nice and fresh flowers,"I received this very nice bouquet of flowers. They arrived fresh and ready to go in to the vase (after reading prep directions first). Very colorful. Just wish there was maybe one more rose or lilie and or maybe two more gerber daisy's to make it look a little more nicer. Otherwise, very nice. Priced right for what you get."
5,Fantastic flowers,"I bought these for my mother's birthday, and she was extremely happy with them (and my mother is brutally honest). She said they were ""beautiful"" for well over two weeks. She also said they were a very large bouquet and arranged very nicely. I will definitely buy from Falcon Farms again."
5,Inspiring,There is no doubt this subject is controversial. I think the producers did a wonderful job with this one. It is thought provoking and merits the recognition it has received nationwide.
5,"Good service, Great documentary",I received this DVD very quickly and I thought this documentary was very insightful and inspirational. If you are into bible prophecy this movie should be in your collection.
3,Good Basic Overview,"Good DVD to get a basic understanding of the Apocalypse and the signs. Interviews with local pastors, etc. Not a high grade production but gets the job done. BnB Beatles Depot"
5,great album!,"I can't believe this guy produced and wrote this whole disc. it's a thoroughly solid album, and he's definitely turning over a new leaf for canadian hip hop!"
3,"Ok hairspray, not the strongest hold.",This hairspray is good if you don't have too much hair and you're looking for a very light hold. I wouldn't recommend for long term wear or updo's. It just simply isn't strong enough. I like that it's all natural and doesn't leave residue.
1,Nothing gripping about it,"I was attracted to this novel because of the great reviews it received and because it was suggested in one review that the book ""attains the level of a Thomas Harris"". I found the book superficial in its character development (espcially that of the serial killer, which I would consider essential for a book about a serial killer!), weak in its plot (not much really happens), and thorougly uninteresting. The only reason I stayed with it and read it to its ending was that I kept expecting it to get better, which it didn't. As far as this genre is concerned, Jan Burke misses the mark completely. I think I'll stick to writers of the caliber of a Thomas Harris."
2,A Waste Of Time,"The last 200 pages were worse than the first 200.I can't believe I read the whole thing!!!!! Jan Burke's writing style is extremely simple and her words do not ""flow"" in a way that you can experience from other writers who are more gifted.Maybe she is trying to appeal to the masses,but it certainly didn't do anything for me. The story dragged on and on and was fairly predictable.This book had a lack of significant character development and a plot that could have taken 200 pages less to develop.I did not make a strong connection with the main characters and I was hoping that the serial killer would murder them all quickly so I could start a Michael Connelly or John Nance novel.Reading a Jan Burke novel for the first time was like eating broccoli when you were a kid. I tried it once , and hated it."
4,These Bones might haunt you,"Burke does a pretty good job of maintaining the suspense of Bones, although I found the Ben Sheridan character more interesting than the protagonist Irene. This is a killer-showing-the-cops-where-the-bodies-are-buried thriller, with the standard turn-around of the villain stalking someone in that group.The book is easy to read, and you can hurry through it. There are a couple of twists, some predictable. But the bad guy is creepy enough, and the main characters intriguing enough, that you want to finish the book and give it to your best friend."
4,I'M SHOCKED. GOOD WRITING JAN!,"""Bones"" was my second novel that I have read by Jan Burke. The first one was called ""Liar."" I absolutely hated ""Liar!"" It was so slow. The main character, Irene Kelly, was a sap to read about. The mystery was just sooo ridiculous and I had to put it down after page 200. ""Bones"" is much, much different. It is a fascinating novel of suspense and Irene Kelly has turned into a Dr. Temperance Brennan (Kathy Reichs) or Dr. Kay Scarpetta (Patricia Cornwell) character. The whole beginning of ""Bones"" kept the readers on the edge of their seat on the wild ride with a serial killer through the Sierra Nevadas and into the city of Las Piernas. The climax and ending were both exhilirating and suspenseful! If you were like me and did not any of Jan Burke's older novels, then try ""Bones"" and ""Flight"" because that is where Jan Burke shines."
1,The Year's Best? I hope not!,"An Edgar for best of that year? That certainly speaks poorly for the competition for this, at best, journeyman-like effort, an overlong, tedious read. The first quarter of the book is its best, then it's talk, talk, talk, with little suspense, a disappointing climactic scene, and some twists that have been given away long before. The novel is populated with dozens of undifferentiated secondary characters; the most interesting is a search dog who works to Spanish commands. This is cliche all the way with little to recommend it. I also read Burke's FLIGHT, and with two of her supposed ""bests"" under my belt, I can erase this author from my list of crime writers I was interested in."
2,"It started out well, but . . .","C'mon, Irene Kelly is purportedly the wife of a cop. She is almost certainly familiar with firearms (and pistols in particular since her husband likely carries one). So, after the explosion (during the exhumation of the second corpse) why wouldn't the author have her probe among the dead cops for a undamaged weapon for the additional afforded protection. The oversight defies credulity."
4,Bones by Jan Burke,"I hated this book. I was so terrified that I could not put it down. I just had to finish this book in one sitting. I was afraid of nightmares. I would not normally read a psychological thriller, so I do not believe that I will buy another of this author's books. But if this is your kind of thing, then this is an excellent writer and a thriller for sure."
3,"Starts with a bang, ends with a whimper...","I was so excited. I began 'Bones' and was immediately taken in by the story and the circumstances. But what began as a tense, interesting game of cat and mouse, ends up preachy and predictable. Bones is comprised of two basic sections. The first section is very enjoyable. The screws tighten, the tension builds, and the events are engrossing. However, the second passage is dull and lifeless, with a climax that induced an expression of disbelief from this reader.Jan Burke writes in short little 3 page scenes (chapters), some of which are quite evocative in the manner intended. However, I disliked this 2 stories for the price of one approach. I also dislike the habit of many thriller writers (Burke included) to have superhuman good and evil characters. Even when Burke tries to imbue feeling in her characters, they come across as flat. And for such a superhuman baddie... Nicky Parrish turns out to be just another wimp."
5,A gutsy protagonist,"When I picked up my first Jan Burke I lucked out by selecting BONES. It deserved the Edgar it got! It was exciting to read about a female protagonist who is gutsy, independent, and a bit of a smart-mouth, like the main character in my Alaska medevac series. I loved it when she taunted serial killer Nick Parrish in order to get him to do something stupid, and her line about the inadequacy of his private parts is one I'll remember for quite some time. Good job, Jan. I'm hoping the title of your next, FLIGHT, refers to flying, not escape, because I'd like to see what you do with my own chosen series subject."
3,Edgar Winner?,"Bones is definitely a page turner. Jan Burke does a fabulous job of grabbing the reader's attention beginning with the first page.... but, somehow manages to lose it by the end. The hike into the mountains to uncover the victim's grave and ensuing action is fabulous ... then once the survivors return home and Irene returns to work ... the monotony strikes in (too similar to a real vacation for me). The potential to wow the reader was there, but was unfortunately squandered somewhere along the way. However, this IS an award winner and deserves to be read."
1,Bones,"What a dreadful book! Poorly written with long boring descriptions and too many characters right up front. By the time I got to the gist of the story line, I had lost interest in either the villain or the heroine. From all the reviews I've seen, Burke must be a fairly good writer. However, she deserves a better editor for this book."
1,unreal,"Improbable, implausible, questionable, unconvincing, incredible, unbelievable, inconceivable, unimaginable..... best discribes this story.Take a pass on this one.I picked this up after reading Jan Burkes The Messenger, which I liked."
2,Winner of the Edgar Award?,"Excellent plotting and convincing forensic data can't offset the wooden characters, lumbering pace, worn literary cliches and unremarkable writing I found in this Edgar Award Winner. I was so disappointed I may never take the Edgar Awards seriously again. As a great fan of Dennis Lehane, Lisa Scottoline, Patrricia Cornwell and other fine suspense writers, I think there are many competing titles on the market that are far, far better. Try Lehane's MYSTIC RIVER and see what I mean."
1,Boring Bones 2,"I have to agree with the ""Boring Bones"" review. What a silly book. How it could earn an Edgar Award is beyond comprehension. The start was interesting but it soon became so unplausible that I had to force myself to finish. In a word.........insipid.JC"
5,Kudos to McDonald,"An EXCELLENT, well researched, indepth account of Sara's tragic murder. It is both compelling and heart-wrenching. A ""MUST-READ"" for anyone touched by this tragedy."
5,compelling and provocative,"This book demonstrated that all is not as it seems. All of the forces involved, drugs, betrayal, family, political and celebrity energies collided in a murder. But the victim and her family prevailed in the end."
3,Dissatisfied reader,"I agree with one of the reviewers who thought that the author spent a lot of time making the victim look perfect. I kept wondering why Sara Tokars didn't leave her husband especially since she came from a family with money. I know people who grew up in Amherst, NY and it's a very affluent suburb. Yes, Fred was not a nice person and a terrible husband but Sara could have left him if not for her sake then at least for her sons. Also, the copy editing in this book was very sloppy. I found errors in dates such as Monday, March 7, 1993 instead of Monday, March 7, 1994. Did anyone bother to look at a calendar?"
2,"What's with the ""Southern Tragedy"" part of the title","Sure, it happened in the South, but both of the Tokarswere Yankee transplants from NY State. There wasnothing Southern about either of them.I used to see Fred Tokars' sleazy commercials onlocal TV during the '80s. I knew the guy wasa crook then."
3,misleading,"I found the cover and blurbs about this book somewhat misleading. They say Sara Tokar was ""the perfect wife and mother,"" but I got no sense, other than a very generic one, of who she was at all. I think the other characters could have been revealed more as well. Why was Fred the way he was? What's his childhood background? Any speculations?The book also states on the cover that this story is ""A Southern Tragedy of Money, Murder and Innocence Betrayed."" I believe both Tokars were from N.Y. and moved to the South - they weren't really Southerners. In addition there doesn't seem to be any ""innocence betrayed."" Everyone seemed to know the situation between the Tokars was dysfunctional."
1,really bad,this book was confusing and very not meaningfull i thought that page lambert did a bad job.
4,good deal,Good deal for the price. The tuner works fine for my son's acoustic guitar. The metronome is loud enough to hear while practicing also.
2,Very Little Useful Information,"I know this a ""portable guide"" to the Dominican Republic, but still it is extremely bare bones and basic. It includes a decent section on Santo Domingo but absolutely nothing on Santiago - the country's second largest city. The rest of this thin volume includes only a couple of short sections on the DR's tourist areas - the North Coast, Punta Cana and Boca Chica. To someone attempting to explore anywhere else in the DR this book is virtually useless. Even for my brief one week trip to Puerto Plata I found nothing in this guide that I had not already discovered on the Internet.I am usually a fan of Frommer's guidebooks. But this one just doesn't cut it."
4,"Good guide, but ...","The Frommer's Dominican Republic guide is a good guide for anyone making a quick trip to the DR. The book does overexaggerates on the crime issue. Crime in the DR is relatively low, maybe even lower than in the USA. Other than that, the book is excellent."
2,This Book is not like the one I read years ago!!!,"I read The Saint Of The Wilderness By Jess Carr,several years ago and it was more Intereresting than this book.Because it told more of Robert Sayer Sheffey's life story,it was a book that was hard to put down.I'd loveto find the one called The Saint of the wilderness by Jess Carr!!!!!!"
3,Things Could Get A Bit Better Than This,"When the McCampbell Brothers came out with their 1988 surprise smash hit ""Roses Are Red"" (hit number one on the R&B charts) produced by LA Reid & Babyface, no one expected the Brothers to follow-up with another successful album like their debut, and unfortunatley they never did. This project fell short of its predecessor. Most of this collection is produced by season old-timer Gary Taylor, and it consists mostly of humdrum mid-tempo rhythms featuring the Billboard R&B top 30 single ""Someone To Love"" and the top 60 single ""Luv U 2 The Limit."" Both songs feature lead vocal's from Derrick McCampbell. The project is filled with moderately paced singles with looping chorus hooks and made-for-the-dance-floor rhythms, others are simmering, more mellow cuts in which McCampbell's tenor amplifies with fervor."
1,Tripp-Lite trips and falls,"After less then three months my Tripp-Lite UPS fails and shuts itself down after running for progressilvy shorter time periods each time. I plugged in a desk lamp alone and it failed after a few hours. The battery will not recharge and fails the entire unit. The UPS actually ""interupts"" power. The plugs on the non-battery side seem to work fine, but then what is the sense of buying a Uninterupted Power Supply ""UPS"". Don't take a chance on this product. It will fail power to your devices even when there is no interruption to your electric service."
1,Zero stars if I could....Total POCrap,A used car battery and a sears battery charger would work infinitely better. Worst product I have bought in years.
1,Randomly Shuts Down for No Reason (as pointed out by other reviewers),"Bought this unit and within a year, it was randomly shutting down for no reason. Contacted Tripp-Lite, and as it was still under warranty, they shipped me a new one. Within a month the new unit started to spontaneously shut down with no warning. Now, when it shuts down, there is NO POWER being sent as backup, so this product fails to do what it's designed to do. Even if it has a design flaw (which I seriously think it does), and it shuts itself down, it should still provide batter backup during those times. If you think this would be the case, you would be wrong!Stay away from this product. Stay away from this product. I'd say it a 3rd time, but you get the point!"
1,Me too.,"Wow. I've had this unit a little under 2 years, and came on here (and other sites) to see if anyone else had this problem. They do, in spades. The thing just shuts down totally, seemingly at random. Other times it trips and beeps incessantly like the power is out, yet the table lamp plugged into the same duplex outlet is still on. Other times it trips for a second, comes back, trips again... repeat.Never had this issue with my APC. Which incidentally is NOW on the same branch circuit and doesn't trip while the Tripp Lite still does. I always liked Tripp-Lite surge protectors but this UPS is a pain in the ___ ."
3,Lousy,"I bought the first one, it was bad. Sent it back and got a second, it was bad. I requested ANOTHER exchange and in return recieved a refund. I just really needed this product in working condition. AND they raised the price $3 from the time I purchased the first one to the second one.This would be an amazing product for a great properaly or if I could actually get one that does.I was disappointed with this company (which seemed so nice and caring on the phone) but obviously they need to step it up a little bit.I'm sorry for the poor review but I just wish your company could have made it right instead of just refunding me and forgetting about me"
3,Little teapot,"Nice ""little"" teapot. and I mean little. I was expecting a much larger teapot. This is only big enough for one small mug of tea. You do get 4 small teacups with it, but I was expecting a much larger pot. Good for a ""spot of tea"", not for a good ""cup of tea"". Also can't help but drip tea every time I pour. Oh well!!"
3,"Useful categories, flawed presupposition","This is a succinct work on an important topic. The categories the author sets up and works within are useful and informative, but require quite a bit of mental acumen to work through. The book's greatest flaw is a Calvinistic presupposition, which the alert reader must recognize and set to one side."
5,The Best Concise Resource on God's Love,"Every seminarian, pastor, elder, church planter and layperson ought to have a copy of this book (and read it!) for the sheer value of having it on hand. It is short--84 pages-- but touches on all the essential aspects of the love of God, especially those ones that are so easily misconstrued. I appreciate Carson's irenic tone and his gracious presentation of his Calvinistic view."
4,The Difficult Doctrine of the Love of God (Purchased on 05/14/2009),This is a great book but not for a new Christian or about to become one. This is for mature believers who long for a better understanding of the aspect of God to His children. D. A. Carson is a great but very deep writer. His command of English is so great to have a need for a dictionary handy as you read this book. I highly recomend this book for a mature Christian.
3,The Difficult Doctrine of the Love of God,"This book is written for someone who has been thru seminary. If you are not a student of Greek, then you'll probably want to skip this read."
3,Unhelpful,"This short text seems to do more to obfuscate than to inform. While a few decent points are made, the book ultimately proves unhelpful."
2,"Bad performance, good looks","Like the other reviewers have been saying about Lextra mouse rugs, they are very nice looking but my laser mouse tracks poorly on it. I get better tracking on the tall carpet in my room..."
1,False Advertisement,"All,My son recently purchased The Sims Collection. I was with him when he placed the order so that I could handle the CC info.This game clearly states in the ad that it will work with Windows 98/me/XP. NOT TRUE.We received the game and upon installation, The Sims and Theme Park lock up his system (he has XP). I went on line and found that others have had the same problem.I emailed Amazon to see if they will accept a return although their policy on software indicates they will not.This is nonsense. Not everyone is a ""techie"" or a full time ""gamer"", You rely on the information provided by the COMPANY YOU ARE BUYING FROM.Beware of one sided deals. With Amazon, they will suck you in with low proces..but then,...You buy it, you own it. If it doesn't work, tell your kids to deal with it and buy them another from someone that can accurately describe the products they sell and know the difference between 98/ME and XP.Ben Holstein"
1,Has Never Worked From Beginning,"I got this DVD player about a year ago, and needless to say, it has never been able to play a complete DVD. Sometimes it is able to play for about 10 minutes, but most of the time, it won't play them at all, let alone open or close the tray. When it reaches its certain 'point of no return', the whole thing freezes, the display is messed up, there is 'noise' on screen, and none of the function buttons work. Do NOT buy this DVD player! To make matters worse, I've not been able to get a direct response from Memorex about these issues."
1,DO NOT buy this DVD player,These Memorex DVD players are junk. They are full of great options but they DON'T last long at all. My family had 3 of the 2026 model that each lasted less than 6 months...two of them played less than 10 dvds before crashing. There was a reason Target only carried that model for a few months before Memorex upgraded to the 2027. This model is also junk. Mine is less than 1 year old and no longer plays MP3 discs. It plays DVDs but does not function like it's supposed to. I won't ever buy Memorex again and I would strongly suggest the same.
3,"a good book, but it wasn't compelling for me","I have no doubt this is a well-written book (I read it in its entirety). Unfortunately, the examples weren't compelling to me at all. While the lambda calculus interpreter was interesting, the time spent on the theorem prover was not very interesting (I wonder if it was added as an homage to ML's legacy??).Overall, I suppose this book is a little dated."
5,We love this comforter,"This comforter is great! It is soft, comfortable, warm, and cozy. It is lightweight, so we do not feel squished under heavy covers.The only downside to this was that it smelled pretty bad when we first opened the packaging. However, the smell went away after a couple of days. I have had that same problem before with a wool blanket that I had owned a few years ago, so it did not bother me. I expected it.We would gladly buy more of these in the future. They are a good value. :)"
3,too heavy,"I bought this because we just got a king bed and needed a comforter and it was a great price. Normally I have had down comforters. I think I'm going to have to fork out the extra money and get down because this is too heavy for us. It's not too hot, but the weight of the blanket itself is heavy and I feel like I have to work way too hard to steal back the covers at night. If you don't mind a heavy blanket, you'll probably like this fine."
5,Comfortable Comforter,"I am also very sensitive to wool, but when I read the reviews of people who were sensitive to wool who used this comforter without problems, I ordered it and it was fine. I use it with a duvet and find it so much more comfortable than even my down comforter which I never thought I would. It is so cozy and the temperature is so perfect that I actually look forward to going to bed. It even makes my aging bed feel newer. I just love it."
4,Wool comforter,Bought this king sized comforter with a Pinzon 160 gram flannel duvet cover. Love both. This comforter is very warm without having to worry about feathers coming out. Comforter fits over the bed very nicely. Would purchase again.
4,Excellent Deal,"It is like a blanket between two sheets, warm. light and thin.It is dry clean only. Should hav a cover and a duvet one is far too big."
3,very warm yet very noisy!,"The cotton outer shell is very loud. I have decided to use this on a need basis for it makes enough noise when you move it keeps you awake. Im sure its because the thread count but even with washing its still very ""crinkly"". I got it for a great price so I will keep and use it on those very cold nights!"
1,Petroleum Odor Right Out of the Bag,"I just received this comforter (pretty much ignored the review from the guy who was unhappy with this comforter because of the smell). Everyone else seemed to like it, so I bought it.As I was taking the comforter out of the plastic zippered bag, the smell of petroleum just hit me! I thought I was imagining it or that the smell of the vinyl storage bag was the cause, but after giving it time to air out, I found that was not so.If you have a sensitive nose or chemical sensitivities, I would not recommend this comforter."
4,A Most Complete Refence for FrontPage 2000,This is a very good reference for FrontPage 2000. It covers practically every aspect of the powerful web design software from Micro$oft. It also goes over Microsoft Image Composer and other auxiliary packages as well.I would have given it a five-star rating had it covered database connectivity in more detail. Also missing is Active Server Pages. I just wish it had gone a little beyond FP and dealt with these issues more (esp. since FP 2000 makes it easy to connect to ODBC databases).
2,I worked but just barely,This was not a good teaching tool but we had a bare bones budget for the class and this was all we could afford. Would NOT recommend for anything but basic intro to HTML class.
5,Clean love story,"Since I got the book for free my expectations of it were low but I truely enjoyed reading this book. The fact that the two main characters would fall in love and the enemies they would face was somewhat predictable but, the book was full of unpredictable twists and turns that made it hard to put down. For those of you who are looking for a historical fiction this is probably not your book because it doesn't really get into everything that was happening in that time period, it basically just focuses on the two main characters and the trials they go through."
4,Different from what I usually read...,"This was a pretty good read, with a few good twists and turns; however, one probably knows how the story ends. The author does a pretty good job considering this is her first novel, but her landscape descriptions don't vary much...needs much more experience in her descriptive vocabulary here. She has an excellent plot as one roots for the hero and loaths the villan! Would recommend it."
4,"Good, fast, read","I love historical fiction so this book was right up my alley. It moved along really well...was hard to put down. It made me wish I could have met up with Matthew Hale myself, in a former life! However, I thought it was written a little too simply-which is why I did not give it 5 stars. However, if there are any sequels to this book, I will definately read them."
5,A Real Winner,"Ms. Gerlach has a real winner with her very first book. This novel, steeped in history, was such a fresh breath of air vis-a-vis the romantic content. Nothing more than a kiss or embrace was suggested, with all else left to the reader's imagination. I wasn't quite sure I'd be interested in reading about the long, long ago, but found myself hooked after the first page. Her description of life as it was in the 1700's was fascinating to say the least. One didn't just hop in their car to visit a neighbor; travel was a matter of days, not minutes or hours. Although you may think the ending was predictable, the author kept you guessing right to the very end. This is one of very few books that truly ""kept me awake""! On more than one occasion, I was close to watching the sun rise, only because I kept saying, ""Just one more page, just one more page . . ."" I'm sure everyone will enjoy this great read!"
3,It's Ok is a good way to describe this book,This book needed a better editor. Events didn't flow as well as they should have and the characters weren't well defined.
4,Caught in the action,"I thought this was a good book. It was funny, and had its own mini mystery. I couldnt fighure out who did what, or why and the mystery did not darken the story either. It had enough mystery to keep you guessing, but light enough that it flowed with the story.I liked Scott, and I liked Nicole. I liked this book. I gave it four stars because at a few points in the story it slowed down quite a bit, but overall, its a great book that I recomend."
4,Groovy,"Such a good CD to just chill out to--perfect for after work.A beautifully mixed, wonderfully dynamic record filled with some really great gems.My favorite of the ""new world"" series so far. Get this!"
5,Raw and authentic,"I've watched Take Out twice now and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a raw and authentic film. It's one of those rare movies that makes you feel like you are given a voyeuristic glimpse into the real lives of its characters. The film's main character (""Ding Ming"", played by Charles Jang, a Korean actor who speaks a very convincing Chinese) and the supporting cast do an excellent job of infusing realism, humility, and a surprising degree of humor in an otherwise serious portrayal of a little known and under-appreciated part of our society. Movies like this deserve more publicity and attention."
2,Dull,"Ming is an illegal Chinese immigrant, living in New York City and working in a Chinese restaurant, delivering the take-out orders. He borrows money from a loan shark and struggles to keep up with the payments. The problem with this movie is that there isn't a story-an 87 minute film and probably 65 minutes are spent watching him peddle his bike back and forth, making his deliveries."
5,Nesco Roaster Oven,The order arrived in just a few days and in excellent condition. I am quite happy with both the purchase and the service.
1,Short life span,"I purchased this product in November of last year. I had hoped it would have arrived for Thanksgiving. It did not. When it did arrive the burn off took longer than the manual stated. I've used this roaster oven 2 times with success. The chicken was moist and tender. Now it doesn'twork. After plugging it in and setting the knob, it does not heat up at all. The return policy states that a product can only be returned in 30 days. That was very expensive way to cook 2 chickens."
2,"Arrived Dirty, wasn't Stainless","This roaster oven arrived very very dirty, like it had been setting on a shelf in the warehouse out of the bag and not in the carton. Both the carton and the bag the roaster were in were clean, but the roaster was in the box upside down. The carton was not factor sealed, but retaped. Very disappointing. Also I specifically clicked on stainless steel when ordering...it is an ugly spray painted gray (Millennium Silver). I checked back on my order and the order did say Millennium Silver, but when clicking it said stainless...so buyer beware."
3,"Snoozefest for older kids, perfect for younger gamers.","I'm a very experienced gamer,so when i played this game, i beat it in one day. My 5 year old brother got it for his birthday and he loves it. He loves hotwheels and he's not very good on the video games yet so it was perfect for him."
2,Rent it,"When i got this game i had high expectations for it. However,it proved really boring,as i beat it in 3 days.I would recomend this game for younger kids or new gamers."

5,Excellent whisk for small tasks,"I have had this type of whisk for many years, having purchased it at Williams Sonoma. Been looking for this whisk for years to give as gifts to friends who have used it at my house. Great for beating small quantities of eggs, or mixing emulsions like salad dressings."
1,Not the quality I was hoping for....,"I just received the whisk and upon taking it out of the box I noticed that there is a very sharp metal edge near the top of the handle making this rather dangerous to use. This does not appear to be an anomaly in manufacturing but more of an overall design flaw coupled with very cheap materials.I find it very hard to believe that Nigella Lawson would use such a cheap and obviously dangerous tool in her kitchen. Sharp edges are for knives, not the handles of whisks.Since it will no doubt cost me more than it is worth to return it, I will just purchase another whisk with a safer design.I would not recommend this item to anyone unless a major redesign of the tool is done. The whisk I purchased will likely never see the light of day again for everyone safety."
1,Dissapointed,Very dissapointed in this whisk. It was more like a doll whisk. Small and flimsy. I will not ever use it.
1,Poor Design,"I was very excited to get this but I am so disappointed. This particular whisk is defective. The little spiral coils do not stay centered but slide off to the sides and down to the bottom. The picture shows the coils surrounding the entire whisk but in actuality, mine came with half those coils which are positioned at the top only. They do not stay in place. It went into the garbage after the first use. I shall shop around for another brand."
4,"NOT NIGELLA'S WHISK, but adequate, all the same!","I would just LOVE to have one of Nigella Lawson's Swiss Whisks with the chunky, rounded handle in those awesome retro colors, and while this particular whisk is of comparable size and design, its handle is merely a continuation of the large gauge wire that holds the small gauge coil which is, unfortunately, a tad loose, seeing as how it is not soldered on to the frame. For that, it lost a star... but it holds tightly (at least for me) in all the other stars, as it is still a sturdy little thing all in all, and it accomplishes what it sets out to do - whisk light mixtures and sauces whilst maintaining a minimalist kitchen decor...Am I happy with my purchase? Most definitely!"
1,THUMBS DOWN!,"The whisk is smaller than a fork and inexpensive. Nigella Lawson uses it, a reviewer said. I added it to an order to get free shipping on another item. Perhaps it will be good for beating a few eggs, I thought. Well, no. The raw egg white clings to the spring-like whipping surface and does not release easily. I cannot think of a single beating or mixing task a fork does not do better - and a fork is a multi-tasker. Five thumbs down."
5,Great Gift Idea,"My sister-in-law was turning 21, and I needed to find a gift that was unique and of special without breaking the bank. This martini glass fit the bill PERFECTLY. She loved it, and I got big points without having to spend big money. I will look at other glasses in this collection for future gifts. I am EXTREMELY happy with the purchase."

5,Worked Great for a bedroom door on carpet.,"When I was shopping, I wasn't sure if I wanted a fun design for our door stop or just a really functional rubber stopper. I am glad I went with the high function stopper. We use it to prop our door open just enough to let the cat into our bedroom at night but keep the dog out."
5,Keeps my apartment door open,This wedge keeps my very heavy door open that has a mechanism that makes it swing shut. Now I can haul things through the doorway with ease.
1,Broken after 6 months,"We ordered this door stop near the end of summer of 2011, as our office's door stop had finally given out after several years of faithful service.This doorstop was markedly inferior. The traction on the bottom of the stopper was not sufficient to keep a heavy door propped open on its own, which is disappointing given the size and bulk of the stopper.But the real disappointment came after several months, when the stopper itself began to crack and break. By the end of January, the doorstop had broken in half. Our prior doorstop lasted five YEARS before it finally gave up the ghost.Between the traction problems and the break, I can't recommend this doorstop to anyone."
3,Ok I guess,"Needed this to keep our small dogs from getting past our French doors. Dogs 1, Super Door Wedge 0. I guess this would suffice for a more traditional use."
2,Slip Sliding Away,"The doors I use this wedge on have wide and narrow gaps at the bottom and are spring loaded to close. I thought that the larger size would be able to handle them all. What I found was that in a lot of cases the door would still creep closed. This was on smooth surfaced floors. Often times I would try to force it farther up the wedge but the rubber ribs prevented any further positioning, so the wedge didn't have the downward force necessary to hold the door."
5,heavy duty,This door stop is very heavy duty and is working wonderfully for our heavy vault door at work. I would recommend this to anyone that needs a door stop for heavy doors.
5,Gets it done,"It's obviously not an exciting item, but it works as well as a door stop possibly can. Would definitely recommend it."
4,Great Game for Youngsters,"I enjoys kids games and this one was no exception. Had A LOT of dialogue from the movie (almost like watching the movie while you play the game). A VERY easy game for adults, but a nice break. It took me about two hours to complete the entire game, but I opened only one of the bonus games. Overall a well put together game and a definite must have game for youngsters. A game with good values is hard to find in this day and age."
5,"One of many ""Unsung"" artists","This cd is hot! But the best thing about it---the seller! I meant to purchase his cd with the song ""This Is My Night"" and mistakenly bought this one:{ The seller was 100% empathetic, returned my money same day, and let me keep this cd! How often will you come across someone like that?---Never! But this cd looks and plays like new, it arrived much earlier than estimated, and although none of these songs match up to the one i thought i was buying, the songs are still hot and he can definitely sing"
3,Small,The teardrop is very small. So in this case you get what you pay for. It will be a nice little gift for a teen age girl.
3,Lumbar roll really didn't make a difference for me at all.,"When you have back problems, you are constantly on the lookout for things that make you feel even just a bit better. When I saw the OPTP Original McKenzie SlimLine Lumbar Roll - #705, I thought it might help while driving.It wasn't difficult to attach to the driver's seat in my car, but I have to say that it really didn't make much of a difference for me. It wasn't terrible, but wasn't great either.Perhaps it might help someone else, but as for me, it made no difference to my sciatica and disc problems."
2,not so slim,This product is not much slimmer than other lumbar rolls by the same manufacturer. It is certainly thicker than what I was hoping for so I'll keep looking.
5,Excellent product,"We received this product quickly and accurately. It is exactly what we wanted, and works just as advertised. No complaints at all."
3,A tad too large,"I bought both the round and the ""D"" support and found them either way too large or a tad too large.. Use if you want a deep curve in the spine."
3,You think you need this but you don't.,"I wanted something small and low profile to use in my office chair. Something that wouldn't push me too far forward in my chair or take up too much space. I thought this would be perfect, but it turned out to be problematic because it doesn't move. I bought the original Mackenzie roll (the round one) and that works much better. I can place it exactly where I need it more easily and it's more comfortable. Don't mess with perfection!"
4,Perfect size,"I am a more petite woman and love the size of this lumbar support. I can't imagine using anything bigger - I don't think there's any way I could sit back comfortably. My only complaint is that it doesn't stay in place on my leather office chair, but it's not a big deal to slide it into place whenever I sit down. Worth the money."
2,disappointed,"I purchased this to be used in my car. First of all, the band that comes with this item doesn't keep it flush with the seat so it moves every time I get in and out of the car. Very annoying! Second, it's still too bulky. I returned this item after using for 10 minutes."
4,Good Product,"Overall, I like it. Only negative is the product is a little thick against my back but still bearable. I would recommend."
4,good condition,It was good condition as I expected. This item is the replacement of the one I had borrowed from my friend and exactly same as it.
3,Totalmente en Espanol pero aburrido.,"Para una nina es aburrido, mi hija ama otros videos de Plaza Sesamo pero nunca le a gustado este. Lo compre por ser completamente en Espanol y pense que seria mas entretenido, pero nada. Hasta a mi me parece fastidioso y fuera de moda."
4,love it,"My son is all about balls, specially soccer balls and this is a great video for learning toddlers. Love it."
1,disappointed,I bought this item for a 3 day camping/hiking trip. By the end of the first day the product was rolling down at the top. By the first 1/2 mile of the second day the support was around my ankle. Wasn't worth the money spent and didn't have another bandage for my hamstring. Very disappointed.
4,not bad,"This book is intersesting thanks to the ""scientific"" method used by the author to do his experiments on real new consumer. Interesting to give you a good overall view but is sometimes too much of a mess, and the message is hard to deliver. Though it's a good buy."
3,Lost opportunity to create something much more wild? Yep.,"Will someone, the director perhaps, ever revisit this soundtrack and properly flesh it out? There are about 50 songs in the movie, not to mention John Cale's and Laurie Anderson's contributions to the score. So much good music! One gem after another, I'm tellin ya! Wouldn't it be FUN if they created a comp with ALL the music on it?I suppose I'll have to join the Download Generation and cobble it together myself.It's worth noting that director Demme, on the commentary track for his EARLY feature ""Crazy Mama"", chuckles as he recalls how cheaply one could obtain song rights then, having obtained some well-known rock tunes for a pittance. 20 years on, there's not a chance in hell you could do a decent ""SW"" soundtrack for less than an actual fortune."
3,Something Mild...,"Typical 80's soundtrack. Half wild, the other half mild. The better songs here make me keep this. One of my fave songs by FYC is here. I still sing along with it 20 years later. Never heard of Steve Jones before, but his song is very cool. The Jerry Harrison (from Talking Heads) song is one of his best, and was in the film Two Moon Junction also. The rest is a mix of decent and blah. My opinion of course. The movie might be a bit better than the soundtrack. It's hard to beat Melanie Griffith in her panties."
1,Tj10stacks,"The remix cd sux,& the last track skips. I didn't report the damage because it didn't cost that much, plus the last time I reported a damaged cd I never got a response. If u get this cd don't get the remix get the original"
3,"Not bad, takes more room than Hansen organizers","I bought a set of these today at Harbor Freight ($10 there). They aren't bad. One or two pegs were oversized and I had a hard time getting those sockets on. Otherwise, good construction.They aren't as dense as the Hansen organizers (they take up more room for the same amount of sockets), but they're about 1/4 the price. Also, even with the space issue, their the best socket organizers I've seen."
3,first Dawg music?,"up and down.. too much Dawg.. like his bluegrass and pure acoustic stuff best.. percussion, horns, etc., ruins it for me.. great musicians and some great tunes.. hard-to-find Mondo Mando from the same period is much better.."
2,"cheesy, cornball, 1980's pop","For a moment, forget what you know about David Grisman. Remove from your mind the image of the bearded and elderly statesman of the mandolin and ambassador for bluegrass jazz. Now, imagine him in the 1980's with a cleanly shaven face, wearing parachute pants, white shirt and a thin pink tie. If you can imagine this, you already know what the music sounds like on ""Acousticity."" The music on this disc is cheesy, cornball, 1980's pop. Grisman himself is in as fine a form as ever -the problem lies in the production. Just as you would recognize Grisman in a cameo for a Molly Ringwald movie, you can still make out his greatness on this recording. Unfortunatley, this album sounds like the producer mixed the disc for lite FM radio airplay. It seems that this disc is currently out-of-print and for good reason. At the time of review, the least expensive used copy was going for $44.97. If you're a wealthy Grisman completist, make this your final disc."
1,"""Total Paranoia"" would be a better title.",It is not hard to see how many obstacles there are to peace in this region when people write such completely biased books like this. Such obvious paranoia paraded as literature makes me ill.
2,Boooooooring...,"Even though this book has some good points, I found it disappointing. If you're a just a casual reader looking for something to read over a sunday afternoon.. or a toilet bowl.. it's fine. But for someone searching for more insight on this subject.. I'd suggest you look somewhere else."
5,The Three Stooges 2000,"I originally recorded this TV movie on VHS tape when it aired in 2000. I skipped the commercials as best I could, but it was not perfect. It took a long time before I could find this movie on DVD, 12 years! The actors do a great job of portraying the Stooges. It is a touching and humourous film. I highly recommend it, especially if you didn't happen to see it when it aired on TV in 2000. It is a must for any Stooges collector! I also highly recommend the ""Ultimate Stooges Collection"" now on sale featuring pretty much all of their endeavors. That too is a good buy."
4,Bare-bones release,"I'm happy to see this finally get an official dvd release. But, for the price, it's as bare-bones as it gets. No menu, no subtitles. Picture quality and audio are passable however. Maybe we'll see a similar release of ""Bud & Lou,"" in the future?"
2,Old Cinderella,"This was the old cinderella, we grew up watching on VHS. It's an older version 2D, but kids love watching it as it is slow and not too much confusing graphics."
3,More Of The Shadow You Know,"Since this was a long lost print, don't expect a perfect transfer. The picture quality shows some age, but isn't as bad as many DVD's for the same price. Since this is not in widescreen format, you get a few cut-offs in the titles now and then. The sound is decent enough, but has a tendency to crackle now and then. Keep in mind the age and rarity of the print however, and you overlook the flaws. Chances are there will never be a Criterion edition of this release.For Shadow fans, this is a must have and a steal at the price. 50's Sci-fi fans would also enjoy this film for the ""special effects."" Grab this, the double VHS serial and the Alec Baldwin film before you get ""International Crime / The Shadow Strikes."""
3,Shadow thrills,I suspect this was a possible tv production. The story is sraight forward with Lamont being needed to protect an exiled political leader requiring protection here in New Orleans.The production will bog down at times but overall it is well done. I for one would like to have seen a sequel or a tv show with the cast and crew. they do a good job with a limited budget.
5,accessible,"Holub attacks a pedagogic treatment of patterns that tends to focus on the abstract description. Of course, this abstraction is important, in order to generalise from specific instances. The whole point of patterns, after all. But Holub points out that often these descriptions are a little too abstract. Many of us learn from well chosen examples. So he follows this precept by elaborating on 2 nontrivial case studies. One is John Conway's classic Game of Life. From this you can see various common patterns emerge from the gestalt, like Visitor and Composite.The other case study is an embedded SQL interpreter. Neither example is complicated. But each consists of several interlocking parts that contributes to an overall complexity that can be challenging if you don't use patterns.Granted, if by one means or another, you're already familiar with patterns, perhaps from the GoF book, then Holub's text will do little for you. But if you're new to patterns, he can offer an accessible insight."
1,The Samsung warranty is worthless,"My ML3051ND came with a defective cartridge, producing white drop-outs across all pages. After four months, a dozen calls, and several faxes, Samsung support operators have been unable to transfer my problem to a decision-making level, let alone fix the machine. Their operators have admitted to being overwhelmed. I finally bought a new cartridge, which cured the problem. But even now, Samsung can't find anyone who can authorize a reimbursement. God forbid your Samsung product should have a flaw that can't be corrected by a trip to Staples.Samsung ML3051ND Compact Laser Printer"
4,"Works fine, great little printer","I love the auto duplexer on this printer. It works fine, produces decent quality prints, and does the job. My complaints are that the registration is a little off on double-sided prints (it varies between 1/16"" and 1/4"") and it is somewhat loud while printing.I have used the printer with a variety of paper stocks and have been really pleased. Every now and then the manual feed has a tough time picking up cardstock. But the occasional paper jam is easy to clear up."
5,"A great deal! No issues, very nice printer.","As advertised and reviewd on CNET. Fast, quiet, easy set-up, good quality, multi-ple connection options."
5,WHEN THE DARK WAS DARKER THAN THE DARKEST,"Wait till it is dark outside then curl up by the fire. It's going to be a long night, because the moment you start to readyou won't be able to stop. You will feel chills running down your back, goosebumps going up your arm. It is full of spinechilling suspense and terrifying horror. You will be transformed into one of the brave teenagers who go on with theirlives unaware that he is watching them. Yes, watching them especially her.""Enne Meene Myne Mo, Who will be the next TO GO?!""Yes, everyone will go or will they? Find out. If you love horror this is the book for you"
5,Fifth Born,"Odessa, the main character keeps you wondering exactly what her secret is and the ""twist"" that Ms. Lockhart puts on her character throughout the book is brilliant. Odessa is a strong willed, curious little girl and she too knows that there is more to her life and her family that meets the eye so she begins to do a lot of observing and listening. I don't want to give the book away but I think there is a little of Odessa in everyone. I enjoyed the book and it was a very quick/easy read. The subject matter was a little bothersome but the flow of the book allowed me to disregard that."
5,Absolutely BREATHTAKING,"This was the best book that I have read this summer! After the first few pages of reading Odessa story my heart was breaking. This book is emotionally exhausting in the way I love for books to be because I form a connection with the characters. ""Fifth Born"" made me want to laugh, cry, scream and in the end it took my breath away! Absolutely wonderful!!"
3,Fifth Born,"The book was OK. It was a Book Club read that I picked. Since I was a fifth born, I thought it may be interesting."
1,Don't buy it. I've had months of headaches.,"I bought this 6 months ago. Black screen. Nothing would make it work (windows XP). I called tech support and they said it wouldn't work with XP without a factory adjustment and that I had to send it back. I did. 4 months later when I hadn't heard a peep from them (almost forgot about it), I contacted them and asked where it was. They said they never got it. I sent them the tracking info showing that not only had they received it, but someone signed for it. They replied that they would send it to me right away. Two days later, I got it. Black screen. Now I'm online trying to find out how to get this dud to work. What a colossal waste of time."
1,Can't install on DELL optiplex GX260,"Looks like it needs a bigger power supply, nothing comes on screen with this card."
3,X1300 will not install with Windows Vista correctly...,"Tried to install this card with windows vista....received a blue screen about 3/4 of the way thru stating that the drivers are not compatible with vista...had to remove the card...put my old card in. Vista installed fine, then tried to install the card again....it installed ok with the built in windows drivers for this card. Downloaded the new 7.1 catylist driver from the ati website....installed it...the card works fine except the Aero Glass does not work as promised on the box."
1,Short Lived - 1 died at 10 months 2nd died at 3months,"My first one lasted 10 months and my warranty replacement lasted 3 months, just long enough to put it over the one year mark and EPSON does not vary from its 1 year warranty regardless of the fact the second machine is only 3 months old. Would not suggest buying this product. It definitely has injet head problems.Very poor customer support for problems, such as I experienced. My company have made a new policy, no more EPSONS."
4,Epson Stylus Photo 1270 Inkjet Printer,"I have been using this printer for over a year now after replacing my HP.I have printed nothing but awesome photos time after time. I would have given this printer a 5 star except for the price on the hard to find ink cartridges. There are alternatives in generic catridges, but the results are less than perfect. A 5 star rating, however, would go to Epson's customer service. These are very knowledgeable, helpful employees. No, I am not one of them, but I have been treated very well, and in a timely manner on several occasions."
2,This printer is missing a paper holder,"This printer arrived quickly, packed well. It works well. However, it has no paper holder. The company answered two e-mails promptly, but did not help. They did not even apologize. It is very inconvenient to have to put paper in, one at a time, by hand. The printer was listed as GOOD. I think GOOD means all the pieces are there. I'm unhappy."
1,Not a good printer for it's price.,"Prints horizontal lines all over the page. Dots are uneven and visible. Compared to my brother's same priced HP P1100, it don't have any duplex printing, memory card or networking capability.Customer support is horrible, You'll be atleast an hour on the phone before you hear a live voice."
5,Gosh this is a great printer!,"This printer is great! After reading reviews on this and others, I decided the take the plunge. The output is fantastic (especially on glossies). Though the ink seems to go rather quickly, I'm very happy with this printer and the output it produces (especially my 11x17 posters (maybe that's why the ink runs out so quickly))! (And when I called tech support, they answered within 2 or 3 minutes)."
4,Have it ......Love it,"I have had this MEV30K for a couple of months. After getting my daughter the 30Gig IPOD for her birthday I was amazed with the graphics ability, but refused to d/l movies from Itunes at 10 bucks each. With the Gigabeat I logged into VONGO.com and for 10bucks a month I can d/l unlimited movies! right now there are about 35 movies on my machine and about 7 gigs in songs. I love this machine.. I travel and it is great to watch movies on this instead of my laptop."
2,it's up to you,first of all...the warranty on this thing is excellent...i sent mine in about a month after i got it (july last year) and they sent it back working fine (audio line didn't work)...but after the warranty that's when it started breaking down...i used an old neoprene case from my handspring pda from like...1999...it fit perfectly...but i dropped it on a soccer trip...the white casing shattered into a million pieces...basically i thought i was screwed...theni just sucked it up and kept using it...and now...well it just doesnt charge anymore...since the warranty is expired...they won't do anything for me...so if you are careful...go ahead get it...but if your gonna run with the MEV30K...it wouldn't be wise to grab one
4,Good Product for the Price,"I consider myself relatively computer saavy. However, I do have some issues navigating through WMP. That is probably the biggest downfall to this gadget. The storage for the $ is spectacular when you compare it to something like an IPOD. While the size is big, a large protion of it is screen...great for uploading funny videos, movies (if you can get one formated right) and pictures. I only give it 4 stars instead of 5 because you do have to use WMP...which doesn't always Sync the way you intend it to (maybe if your better at using the program, this won't be such a PITA). Also, because I'm really picky about how my song screen displays, I find it really tedious to find the album information for each of my songs so that the name and album art display correctly with each song. I've spent nearly 48 hours fixing all of my mp3s."
4,Good deal!,"More space then IPOD for less cost. Easy navigation. Nothing very fancy. A lot bigger than an IPOD though, so if you are looking for size you might want to reconsider. Also does not come with a carrying case, will have to buy one or make one. Overall, great product!"
4,Toshiba MEV30K Gigabeat V 30 GB Portable Media Player,"Pretty nice music player and photo player. I was also able to play some of the videos that I had in my computer. While it is not as slim as I would have liked, it does have a nice color screen and I like the menu. I have yet to figure out how to add playlists, but overall I am satisfied. Is it as easy to navigate as an Ipod, no, but I don't believe it is trying to be one."
4,great mp3 player,"This player is easy to use, has great sound, and a much larger video screen than the ipod video. The only downside is that are no protective cases to be found for this model. I'm using a PDA case, and it seems to work out OK."
3,Really good or bad,"I believe this is one of the best mp3 players out there, music, video, pictures, and built in speaker (could be better), it's all there. But the headphone jack broke after two months. There may be couple reasons for this: 1# I am an athlete so I run with my mp3, 2# I left it in the car couple times over night, and 3# I dropped the player 2-3 times. So who knows? If your good at taking care of your electronics, then maybe this product is for you. But if you're a runner like me, then maybe buy some other mp3 player that's for ""sporting use""."
1,There's a reason its discontinued!,"This unit is absolute garbage.Forget the moronic design, lack of features, etc. The actual construction is terrible. The allegations as to battery life are utter fabrications, the buttons don't always work, but, get this, IT SPONTANEOUSLY ERASED ABOUT 20 GIGS OF MUSIC.Pretty sure Toshiba got wise and took this junk off the streets. Anything you buy has been sitting in a warehouse somewhere since 2003.Spend the extra cash and get a reputable unit. Toshiba does not know how to make media players."
3,Ok for additional practice,"I took and passed the PE in 2006. Along with many other books, I used this one to prepare mainly for the afternoon session on Electronics, Communications, and Controls. A few of the problems were marginally helpful, but as the previous reviewer mentioned, there are mistakes. To help others with this test, I created my own sample test for the morning session. It available for free (no catches), with solutions, at my site (klkaiser)."
2,Do probles build on each other like this book in the real exam...,"... I hear the book has mistakes, and I hate how each problem builds on the previous one... Will the exam do that? If you miss one, you miss them all? I don't think that is fair..."
4,good songwriting,"6 months of listening to this cd, not tired of it! ""ballad of blackie john"" is as good/haunting piece of music as i've heard in a while...""getting on a train"", ""i won't see you"", and i really like ""ode to rufus james""...i met john once when he was younger, i have heard him play live, this is a solid cd worth your time to buy, and give it a long listen....it seems to grow on me the more i listen..sounds like john, but folk rock fans will enjoy this music, compare to: steve earle, petty, etc....but it really does have a breath of it's own."
3,A Good Place to start,"I am familliar with the 1977 Edition of Baird's Manual, but I have some concerns. As an officer of a fraternity, I am concerned that the omissions and inaccuracies reflected in the listing of my own organization are generalizable about the book. While the basic data is true, the book paints a somewhat innaccurate picture of my organization. It is my hope that these will be corrected in future edition of this pblication. Additonally, the lack of a bibliography bothers me."
3,not that helpful,"This is pretty easy to use, just sometimes it takes a while to be able to actually find the right words. And I think it works a lot better when writing poetry to either not use the word if you can't think of anythin that rhymes because most of the time when you add one of the words from the dictionary, it sounds artificial and out of place."
5,buy this cd and prepare to love it,"If Rage, Tool, System of a Down, and Limp collided in a 4-way collision at an intersection and only the best of all survived and created an agressive, corrosive cd....this would be the result! Strap on your headphones and enjoy a pure adrenalin injection. I loved the whole cd at first listen....it's been a while since i bought a cd that I could listen to from start to finish and then hit repeat. I wish I could buy stock in these guys, this cd is the balls."
4,A good technical guide to woodcarving,"A good general book on woodcarving. This book could be better if it didn't try to be all things for all people. There are better books for beginners out there for the money and more advanced carvers probably need to buy a book concentrating on their type of carving. I found it to be a little on the technical side and would have preferred a few more patterns for each type of carving.My favorite sections were on finishes, sharpening, and the tool section. There are numerous photographs of some beautiful examples of the various types of carving. The author does show some very useful carving techniques in most of the carving styles.Sections include tools, sharpening, woods and finishes, design, whittling, chip carving, relief carving, wildlife carving, lettering, archatectural carving, and a bibliography."
1,Woodcarving,"This is an excellent book that covers the fundamentals of carving plus adds great advice on what tools to purchase. Asked if I would buy this book again, my answer would be yes! I messed up on the rating of this book and I give it five (5) stars. Sorry!David Self, New Boston, Texas"
5,As promised,I ordered a used book. I received it on time. The book was in as promised condition and I paid a small fraction of the bookstore's price.
3,wood carving is a terrible hobby,"I've must've cut my fingers a dozend times before i gave up. If you want to get some concurrent learning experience out of this, buy another book with swear words. You'll need it."
2,"better then not having anything, i guess","still not worth the money, go on line, alot better info on the web, its free and save the money for your tools. tim"
5,Great!!,"This Lundmark wax is a great wax, and it does what it suppose to do! I have been looking for a product to wax my floors for my home. This is better than mop and glo."
5,Always in my head,"Such a great musical, I'm surprised i've never heard of it before until my school actualy decided to perform it. Playing for the show orchestra, I got to see the music, and hear it everyday and instantly fell in love with it. I just wish I could see the real thing somewhere else. Enjoy, i know you'll love it as much as I had"
3,Nothing to Write Home About.,"I remembered hearing the title song a few times, and liked it, so I naturally bought this album. The material is second rate. The story of a blue collar man who inherents a large fortune, while maintaining a romance. This could provide an enjoyable evening at the theater, but it does smell a little like the earlier ""Half a Sixpence"". There are the proverbial ""nice tunes"", but nothing spectacular. Even though the album was produced by Thomas Z. Shepard, protege to Goddard Lieberson, the sound is a little bit murky. The instruments seem a bit loud, and the actors usually have a poor vibrato to speak. Of course, it is at a reasonable price, so it will not put you out a fortune, and it is better than most British imports today (you know who you are). All in all, it is a matter of preference, so you may enjoy it."
2,Don't embarass yourself by walking into a lab with these,"I always feel uncomfortable when giving negative reviews, but this is a case of you get what you pay for. The goggles were made of extremely thin and flimsy plastic, and it did not cover my face in the suction-cup way that is required for laboratory goggles. It is visually apparent how poor of quality these are, and I did not dare go to the lab donning this thing. A typical made-in-China budget product, please be willing to pay a few more dollars for better safety than what these protective goggles would offer."
3,Would be great if the right size,"I bought a Tempur-pedic California King Cloud Supreme. The down comforter is warm and very soft. My only complaint is it isn't wide enough. It's plenty long. The packaging says it's for a King/Cal King, but things would have been even worse if I bought a king mattress instead because it would have been even shorter."
4,Awesome!,"Great product. Like the previous reviewer, it was impossible for me to find a cal king down comforter....and i was so happy to find one on amazon. The product is great, warm, but still light weight. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is: I have a down comforter for a queen bed in our home. I spent $500 on that comforter (a lot for a queen). That comforter is puffier, fluffs up more easily, 500 thread count. Very luxurious! That comforter blows all others out of the water.....but for the price the cal king sold here so awesome!"
2,Not warm enough,"It was much lighter than I expected it to be, I have to use a blanket with it on the bed to stay warm."
3,Correction to Book Description,"I have not read this book. However, I would be greatly surprised to find that condensed matter physics now includes hot magnetized plasmas as the Book Description suggests. (GUT's galore!) I saw no way in which to correct this, hence my ""review."" I also had to select a number of ""stars,"" so picked the middle one. Someone please do correct me if I'm in error here, and I'll purchase this book immediately."
3,Could be worse,"I bought one of these a few years ago -- not from Amazon. Most of the time it collects dust in the corner, but occasionally I remember to bring it outside for a party or while doing yard work and it works as advertised. You have to fine-tune it to work on the proper frequency -- and the interface is not intuitive (one can easily change the frequency and terminate the reception while trying to adjust the volume) -- but it saved me from buying a full set of outdoor speakers. Not a glowing review, to be sure, but it's better than a one-star product."
2,Very Bad Book,"I found this book very confusing at times. And there was certain important information that was completely left out. Especially with regards to the dates of when certain books were written, the sentences would seem to contradict each other. I did not enjoy this book and feel that all the information I wanted to know was left out. I know that it is difficult to date Zoroastrian writings but they hardly mentioned anything about the dating at all!"
1,I Expected Better From Facts On File,"There is not a thing wrong with the text of this book. It is well written and informative. The problem is that this book claims to be an updated edition. We've been able to find no changes from the prior edition. In my opinion, this is tantamount to defrauding schools and libraries with limited budgets, not to mention the folks who work hard to pay the taxes. Buy the version that's not updated. You'll get the same product probably for a better price and let Facts On File know that such conduct is not appreciated."
5,a look inside cancer survivors,"short concise testimony after testimony of fighters on the cancer front line showing real courage and committment. survivors.i wish J T, my first cousin who died from cancer, could have had this book. i praise the Lord that my sister, who has just survived cancer(no detectable traces now), had it.i wish it could be available to everyone who has cancer, thinks they might get cancer, or knows someone like either."
5,"Great ""Philosophy of Science"" book","This is by far one of the best science books for the layman I have ever read, and I enjoyed reading it. I especially liked the discussions of the cultural context inwhich Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton worked. The break that Copernicus made with common sense AND religous dogma is so great as to boggle the mind even today. And Kepler's determination that the Earth's orbit is an ellipse, again defies belief, since it was done before calculus was invented, or the law of Gravity determined.I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good science read."
1,DO NOT BUY SPYWARE DOCTOR,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! Spyware Doctor is a bad product sold by an invisible company. Do not buy it! The product will not run on most computers because it is a memory hog. It froze my machine and I spent 2 hours with a technician trying to re-boot. You cannot remove the software, you cannot get technical support nor any response from them. They have the right to charge your card once a year regardless and you cannot stop them. Bad, Bad, Bad!!!"
3,Hard to activate in a network system,I too purchased the product. It will not activate when you are in a network with a firewall. I e-mailed the company but no response.
4,"""Bobby"" is phenomenal","In this age where r&b; is so souless, its good to know there are recollections and memories of good production in the genre.My mom bought ""Bobby"" in the fall of 1992 and we wore the cassette out in our new 1992 Toyota Tercel.""Bobby"" is the at the zenith of the ""new jack swing"" era led by its pioneer Babyface. With songs like 'Humpin Around' 'Good Enough' and 'Get Away', the album posseses an aura of talent backed up with musicianship that is superb.Bobby Brown struck a chord on this one personally.The songs are catchy and memorable.I highly recommend this record."
5,"His best CD, in my opinion.","My favorite song on this CD is definitely ""Lovin' You Down"", but I really can't say there was a bad song here. If you loved 90's R&B, this is a very underrated album. He'll always be remembered for ""Don't Be Cruel"" ""Perogative"" and ""Every Little Step"", and deservedly so, but this CD was fantastic. I wish he'd just pull himself out of whatever he's on and come back with it."
2,good music wack vocals = a 2,"Bobby Brown lost his flavor on this record.the songs Produced By New Jack Swing King Teddy Riley two can play that game,get away,till the end of time are tight as is the LA&Babyface cut good enough.but the problem is the wack singing of Brown.he sounds flat.it wasn't as bad on this disc as it is now.now he is a tone deaf.also while the album has highlights it has downs as well.besides Bobby's bad singing some of the music make this album Don't be cruel part 2.with the right voice this album would have been done better."
1,see what crack cocaine does to you kiddies,bobby brown used to be a big star but somewhere he became addicted to crack cocaine and these are the results every song on this cd is bad we all know bobby can't do it anymore.
1,Do not purchase this video,"Please do yourself a favour and do not buy this product,We were so disapointed with the content,too many racist comments,and not enough music,poor content, poor interviews and a total waste of money,its so sad that a great player has so much haterid in his heart.we want music to fill our hearts with Joy not to screw the Knife deeper into the wounds.Do not Buy."
2,Noir that suffers from becoming Black,"I must confess that I have trouble with novels in translation. All too often I'm brought up short by a phrase or construction that simply sounds, well, ""translationese"".APOC suffers from this more than most. It is a real struggle to translate the translation into something resembling ""American"". Once you do, if you can, it's a pretty taut little tale of crime, vengeance, and low-lives as they are lived. But for so brief a book, on so explosive a theme, to move as slowly as it does, weakens the effort considerably."
5,Excellent guide to online option trading,I enjoyed the book and the Appendix analysis of top option web sites.It is a concise introduction into trading options. For $20 it a great place to start to learn how to trade options online.I liked it as it was not a promotional piece instead a real traders attempt to unearth the how to of trading options on the internet. Fontanills I thought was very modest in the book as he omits talking about himself in any depth other than in a light hearted manner to illustrate he is an ordinary guy made good.Great book. Worked for me.
2,Good for beginners,"This is a reasonable book on elementary options principles. It also has a pretty extensive listing of good internet resources for traders. But if you're looking for any advanced trading ideas, look elsewhere."
2,not well edited,"There are some errors in the book which indicate that it was not properly edited. e.g. In the section on ratio put spreads, he refers to a Jan 95 put with a premium that is different from the amount in the accompanying table. The net debit amount is therefore calculated incorrectly and the max. reward is also incorrect. I found this type of error in earlier sections. They may look like minor errors but they are confusing and detract from the effectiveness of this introductory book. Also, Some of the formulas (e.g. break-even price for call retio backspreads) are sloppily formulated with incorrect brackets."
2,WARNING! Examples are incorrect,"WARNING!!!I found this book to be very well written and appeared to be carefully put together.That is until I got to Chapter 6 in which I found glaring mistakes. Case in point, the description of the bull put spread is written such that the author has used different strike prices throughout his example, resulting in an unreadable, confusing mess.This is unfortunate as I think that if the author or his publisher had taken the time to proof the book, these examples should have been corrected.Save your money and find another book to use as an introduction to options trading."
1,Trade Options Online,FRom your description this sounded like a very good book since I am interested in trading options. Lo and behold I find out this book was published in 1999 and in 8 years lots of new things have been developed. You should have mentioned in your promo that this book was written 8 yrs. ago. I got ripped off. Just be honest with your descriptons. Les Lerner
1,Nothing new,"The book is O.K. The strategies are very old even though Mr. Fontanills, gives the impression that he invented them (through so-called optionetics)!. Please skip the part where Mr. Fontanills promots himself as he does in his options courses !"
3,what about IRA's,"I was disappointed that perhaps half of the book is about brokers, yet there is nothing on which brokers allow options trading within IRA's"
3,Please Read This Review Carefully,"This book is only a decent overview of options trading. Its pluses include its concise descriptions and profit/loss graphs of different option strategies and invaluable information on finding an online options broker. HOWEVER, it leaves the reader with unrealistic expectations (like all of Fontanills' and Optionetics' materials) in that ALL of the trades in the book are profitable. Take it from someone who has learned this personally -- options trading is NOT a ""get rich quick"" scheme. Should you choose to try it you will have MANY unsuccessful trades. A book which is very easy to understand, yet which provides valuable guidance on WHAT CAN GO WRONG is Max Ansbacher's _The New Options Market_. I sincerely recommend that book because it is able to describe the pitfalls of options trading in a manner which I've not found in other books. Good luck!"
2,Time value of that book is zero,"First 8 chapters give you a very superficial introduction to the options trading and some strategies. Let me repeat - very superficial. If you want to learn that matter, you definetely need another book.So, I was trying to get usefull info on the WEB resources. Let me tell you - two years make a big difference in the Internet world. Many sites do not exist. Some of them have nothing in common with the description, which you find in a book. Chapter 9 - ""cybervesting from A to Z"" is a complete waste of time and is full of frustration. It guides you through interfaces of nonexisting web pages. The pages, which, according to th author, answer the crutial questions of a trade. I lost most of time just to verify nonexistence of the referenced resources."
4,A fresh new vision of a classic in 3D,"I must disagree with most reviews of this film, because I was tempted to not buy it when I read all the ones about it, but I thrust my instincts and bought it and I must say that is a really entertained version of a classic and I don't ask for more, because all the films made it about the Three Musketeers where all the same. The actors and all the crew put their best effort for made the dialogs not boring, plus the 3D, that is not bad at all repelling all bad reviews, made of this a nice action movie, worthy to watch."
3,The Three Muskateers,"The movie is a fun movie to watch, watching it in 3D makes it even better. The quality of the movie is suspect, it has several flaws, there are scenes that fade out, and a couple black drop outs, it only last a couple seconds but takes away from the overall viewing of the movie itself, this is why I didn't give the 5 stars I think it deserves. I'm a huge Logan Lerman fan. Whatever company put this movie to disc need to check their master copy for flaws."
3,A little fantastical with good action,"Overall I liked the movie and was happy with it. I think a lot of this lends to the actors playing the endearing roles of the musketeers. All parts of the movie were ok with nothing standing out particularly strongly. The action sequences were good with not too many cuts. Mainly, there were a lot of fantastical moments that came across as slightly far-fetched. But it you are ok with taking things as you seem them, you should give this a watch."
5,Better than I expected,"As soon as we got this movie my family and I watched it. I was not expecting a whole lot of it but I have always loved The Three Musketeers and have watched almost all of the adaptations. I was really impressed with this version. Right from the start it captured me with the intro of all the musketeers, especially Aramis(sighs) ;) There was a lot of action, romance, comedy, and drama to keep you entertain. It may not follow the book exactly but it was good. Everyone has their own opinion and I respect that, but I think give it a chance and have an open mind."
4,A fun adventure!,"I didn't go into this movie with high expectations, which seems like it might be a good thing from what I can gather from other reviewers.I enjoyed it. There's a lot of action, some laughs, and a couple of eye roll moments - one of the women does a couple of dodging fight moves worthy of The Matrix.I've never read the book, so I can't comment on how well it follows that, but the four musketeers are all arrogant, but fun to watch - and you really end up rooting for them!I would recommend this for anyone who likes adventure movies, fans of Logan Lerman (or any of the other actors), history buffs (though I can't speak to how well they stuck to true history), or anyone looking for a movie with a LOT of action and a little bit of romance."
4,Very fun.,"This was a very fun movie. It is not to be taken seriously, it is just a fun action packed movie."
3,Fun to Watch If You Can Give Logic a Night Off,"It is Fun, clean, and historically absurd, but really, its ""one for all"" so what do you expect...Park your brain, break out party favors, the kids can watch this safely as there is not much adult content. PG-13 has killed this story. What good are swordsman who fail to duel a few ladies...3 stars for 3 bucks, its worth a candy bar and a coke."
2,Prefer the 1993 version,"Humor was dry, acting could have been better. Costumes were the only thing that slightly made up for it. The 1993 version has much better acting, humor, soundtrack and character development."
2,Horribly Done,This is one of the worst movies that i think has been produced in 2011. I mean what was going on! The script was boring and cheesy the acting sucked. I was very disappointed in Orlando bloom acting. He seemed like he was trying to imitate Johnny Depp in parts then this random mean gay guy in others. This move was a total waist of good money and time. Even the comedic relief wasn't even funny! Horrible DON'T WATCH!!
2,Bad acting,"poor script, dull characters, disconnected relationships, overall it was unbelievable. I mean that in the strictest sense. I didn't buy one relationship, one actor, one moment. I finished it because I paid money. It was dull and senseless in the truest form. Visuals were nice, but they too never really connected. The best parts were the maps. In short, this movie was a stew created by a first time cook. Nothing mixed well."
2,The Three Musketeers,"Being able to watch movies from home is great; I did find this movie a bit boring, so maybe too many musketeer movies have been made? Thanks for having it available for me."
2,The three musketeers,The DVD is locking up and I have to skip over the spots it stops at to get the movie going again. The delivery of it was fast though it just doesn't work well.
1,This movie was a ball of slimy sewer sludge that has been processed with cheap men's cologne and really bad eggs.,"This movie was so incredibly Unrealistic I thought,momentarily, a large speckled unicorn had invaded my home, eaten all good sense and left me with feelings of angst and no chap stick. I honestly have no idea if that was supposed to be a comedy or was just made by immensely idiotic midgets with no fashion sense. Throughout the entire movie the main character D'Artagnan's hair was plastered to his metaphorical and literal huge head. I really hated this movie. Don't Buy it."
1,Unwatchable,"Now I know why I didn't notice when this bomb went without a whimper through its theater release. A silly superhero version of the three musketeers that completely loses sight of the original story, but used the title for something completely different and oh so much less. If you didn't think that story and character matter much, then this is the kine of movie you would make. A string of action vignettes with no heart or soul. Nice.We couldn't finish it."
1,Guitar picks,"This movie was boring, horrible and everything else you could think of. I always think when actors do these types of movies, they only do them to pay rent/mortgage. They should take the film and turn it into guitar picks. Please, I beg you don't waste your money."
3,Not bad,A decent movie if you have the ability to use your imagination. A tad silly in parts. The best parts being the special effects.
1,Really? Horrible Movie with HORRIBLE ending!,I can't believe I wasted 2 hours and $3.99 rental fee on the horrible movie. It was predicable and Milla Jovovich was the ONLY good thing about this movie. I would recommend not to waste your money and wait until it is cable or regular TV (which should be in about 3 or 4 months).
2,What!?,"This was a bad movie that I con only imagine the writers were hoping the audience was as dumb as the script. I am only giving 2 stars for the 3d only but the movie and acting itself gets 0 stars.I already wasted my time watching this movie so I don't want to give any more of my time to it in a long review, I just wanted to let others who may be thinking of purchasing this movie to NOT. Rent it if you must but I would still say skip this one all together.For the 3d owners , yes it was clean 3d decent depth, not great, but even if the 3d jumped out and slapped me on the face I still would hate this movie."
1,boring movie and crappy 3d such a waste of time,"Was lookin forward towards watching this movie bc the previews lookd real good and it was in 3d, well now I wish I didnt waste my time or money,the story and fight screens r boring and nothing special and the 3d was horrible and the biggest thing I hated was there was the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen and if anybody knows 3d thats a big no no bc u focus more on the lines then the actually movie,"
1,Orlando Bloom + Water = Bad Movie,I'm not blaming Orlando Bloom for this movie. I have watched him act in several films where I was thoroughly impressed. That includes the very first Pirates of the Caribbean. My title is more of a joke between friends who hated the other PotC movies.This movie was not a fun romp. All of the characters were over the top and the story was innacurate and lackluster. I hope that there are no sequels.
2,All dressed up and nowhere to go,"This movie had lots of potential but fell very short of it. It was predictable, and cheesy (and not the good kind of cheesy). Special effects were good but nothing ground breaking. I was hoping for a Three Musketeers movie that took itself more seriously than the 1993 version. This movie was nothing more than the 1993 version redoux. I don't blame the actors, I blame the direction and the script."
1,"Q: What role was Alan Hale, Jr. known for? A: Skipper","And this movie is a SKIPPER...unless you only have two hours left to live and your dying ambition is to watch one last movie and no other movie is available. Otherwise, I am not sure why Milla soiled her reputation as a zombie-killing action heroine to share a less than starring role in this. It looks like it was written and filmed in Eastern Europe. And the audio is atrocious! It sullied the Three Musketeer legend to unspeakable proportions. The lead character looks like a 1970's version of Justin Bieber. Many of the scenes were remakes from other action movies so while at first glance you want to give them a thumbs up for original idea, it actually isn't original at all."
2,Smells real bad,I was very sad to see such talented actors in such a poorly done movie. I hope they all got a good payday for being in this stinker of a movie.
2,Kid's movie,"I did not see this in 3D which I am sure was a great loss here. I would suggest seeing it in 3D.The film itself has some ridiculous story lines and going by the ending has a sequel planned.The story itself basically follows the original. Since I knew the original story, I knew what was going to happen. I think it ruined much of it for me.None of the characters, I thought were particularly interesting. The acting I thought was average.The actual filming was brilliant. The colors, the buildings, the scenery, the special effects, the costumes, all very good.The action scenes were reasonable. What struck me was the lack of blood in them. People getting hit by swords but no blood. It seemed so fake.The air balloon and air battles all looked out of place.Overall, it is probably not fair me judging it as it is a kid's movie."
4,Dumas's Mission Impossible,"If you can imagine Resident Evil's Milla Jovovich in (and occasionally out of) hoop skirts, you're off to a great start. The Three (plus one) have been done so many times you might think it's played out. Hardly! Starting with the classic political intrigue, this adds some Mission Impossible-style exploits, steam-punk aerials, all-out effects, and the doofiest British royal on record. And, for once, we get a modern action/adventure babe mixed in.Hardly for Dumas purists, this popcorn-worthy flick dishes out what it promised: excitement, surprise, and utterly forgettable commodity entertainment.- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters"
3,Could have been better,"I felt the story plot was good, the action far to slow and themusketeers did not do enough acting..............."
3,A good entertaining movie,Not a block buster by any means... but is entertaining and worth the rental... purchase... maybe not so much. The story and effects were a tad week but overall a good watch.
2,Lame,"For a movie set in the early 18th century, everything looks clean, new and more technologically advanced than it really was. All of the matrix-like slow motion and dull dialogue really made this a mediocre movie.After watching this movie, I am convinced that Milla Jovovich can do no better of an acting job than that what was already done in her the Resident Evil movies."
1,Stinks Like Smoking Dog Doo,"This movie is just...oh it's so bad I can't even find the words. I decided to watch this because I am a big fan of The Three Musketeers and have seen every version since those from the '70s. I didn't expect much from this but I at least assumed it would be watchable.I was terribly mistaken. And I thought the '93 version with Charlie Sheen was bad! Little did I know.With this you get a lot of bad acting, corny special effects and pathetic dialogue. The only thing good about this movie is the setting and costumes which are breathtakingly beautiful. Other than that...this movie is a dog. Oh wait, excuse me I'm wrong. Actually this movie is more like what the dog leaves behind on the carpet.It's 2012 and Hollywood has access to super technology that could've really made this film a masterpiece for the new generation. Instead we get an MTV version of The Three Musketeers and Orlando Bloom with a pompadour.No thank you."
2,Fair,Second rate movie. Must have been produced for substandard movie go'ers. I cannot believe that movie go'ers really think that this one is indicative of all produced for the average movie go'er.
2,poor remake,"An original movie classic trying to be updated but falling far short. The flying ships belong in a comedy and they turned this classic into a ship of fools instead of adding more clearity and better film coverage. Amazon is as always great, but this movie was a flop."
1,Don't....just....don't...,"The Good: The Three Musketeers themselves, Mathew McFadyen, Luke Evans and Ray Stephenson are all good, for what little they get to be themselves.That's it.The rest is so bad I'm at a loss to find the words to describe my disgust at this festering turd of a movie. It borrows a couple of bits from the fun-yet-campy 1993 version but Logan Lerman is no Chris O'Donnell. And yes, Chris O'Donnell isn't good in the first place.The script is horid, the CG is painfully obvious and the rest of the characters are about as deep a a puddle of spit in the Sahara. So little of this movie makes sense, and even less of it is entertaining. It's almost like a 10-year old wrote a script and for his birthday his film exec dad greenlighted it with a $100 million budget. It's not cheesy, campy fun, it's just awful in every way outside of McFadyen, Evans and Stephenson."
2,"Sad, sad, sad","There were som great actors, but the script was crap. I liked the guy who played in Clash of the Titans."
1,TURRIBLE,"The action scenes were ok. Dialogue was terrible; choppy; awkward. Since I know most of these actors are amazing, it must have been the writing/directing that flopped it. The word ""Yep"" was used. If not for the famous actors, it would have been a ""B"" movie all around. Turrible. Turrible, turrible, turrible. D'Artagnan not convincing. To top it all off, the song for the credits was someone singing and playing an acoustic guitar. One more time: turrible."
4,cool idea,The movie itself was good..worth watching again and the quality was great. I was a bit disappointed that there is no disc. I will probably not buy a movie this way again. My family likes to pass movies around and this is just a pain to do as well as the fact thatif the web goes out for some reason there is no way to retrieve it.
3,Fun film,"The Movie was fun, and well made. I liked the characters and the directors vision in this version of the Three Musketeers."
3,better than I thought,"Not a terrible movie. And the 3D is pretty good. Nothing great, but if you have a 3DTV, worth a look."
2,Classic superficially redone.,"In 1844 Alexander Dumas published Les Trois Mousquetaires which has become one of the world's greatest novels. The story follows the adventures of D'Artagnan and the 3 musketeers set in France in the early 1600s during a time of power struggles and intrigue between the king and church.This movie is a loose remake of the original taking general themes and protagonists but developing new specific plot elements. The general tone is comedic bumbling by our heros keeping them safe but it just doesn't feel right for the seriousness of the stakes (death). The young, hip actors are trying to make a modern, fast-moving drama that retains one's attention but they lose the sense of intrigue, suspense, and gravity that marked the novel.Steer clear of this remake."
4,A good adventure story,"A good adventure story, a bit light, but keeps your interest.More of a comedic alternitive history than a closely detailed historical costume drama.Get out the popcorn and enjoy!"
4,Great movie for what it was intended to be,"This movie was great for what it was intended to be: mindless fun action. I am surprised by all the negative reviews that complain about how unrealistic and unlike the books it was. Hmmm... the flying ship on the cover didn't give that away to you? If you like movies like Tomb Raider, The Rundown, etc., then you will probably like The Three Musketeers."
4,"Great 3D, Great movie","Okay, so maybe this film isn't 100% faithful to the original novel. So what?!? And maybe the acting isn't that great. So what?!This movie has incredible special effects and action. It's a wonderful twist on a classic tale that stays much more truthful to the novel than ""The Musketeer"" with Justin Chambers from the year 2000. Also, this was filmed in 3D so the 3D effects are amazing!Definitely worth the purchase."
2,Betrayed,I rented this due to the other negative reviews and I am glad I only rented it. I like Milla Jovovich but even she did not seem to be invested in this role of betrayers betraying other betrayed betrayers who betrayed betraying betrayers ad disgustum. She may not have been in this except her husband directed it. A rather pointless exercise. Was this a comic book story? It was laughable but I did not find it funny. Too bad.Swashbuckling. Rushing to the aid of damsels in distress. Rushing hither and thither. Breaking and entering. Intrigue as far as the eye can see. Airborne battle scenes as if at sea. Crashing atop Notre Dame? Was Director Anderson making a statement? And everyone lived unhappily ever after.
5,Three Muskeeters for the modern age.,This movie is not a tradition rendering of the Three Musketeers and has a series of twists on comedy/action feel to it makes it a Three Musketeers for the modern age. Overall it was fun on the story/characters with great 3 D picture effects.
5,Awesome,"A modern take on a classic movie. Very well done, loved the action sequences and the character development. Would definitely recomend."
1,waste of time,This movie was a complete waste of time. It wasn't able to hold my attention for more than 5min. After the opening scene. Every scene was just missing something...
2,Dismal Remake,"This was a dismal attempt at reinventing the Three Musketeers. The airships just did not work in the setting. The climax was certainly anything but that. And the acting, though the cast included fine actors, was poor. All in all I was very disappointed and sorry that I wasted my money on the blu-ray!"
2,Ridiculous movie,The most enjoyable moments and best acting in this movie were the brief ones with Planchet. The rest of the movie was just mind-numbing.
3,It is ok.,"It does not look like the one in the picture. The fur falls down a little. But still acceptable! This teddy bear is not bad looking either.My baby loves it. The teddy bear does stay up on his own even with my baby reclining on it's belly. This is how my baby learned to sit up. He is now 7 months and I still use it to make sure he does not fall on his back and hit his head. The legs also help to keep baby on place.I use it every day!I am giving it a 3 star review because it is not as pretty as useful, and not as pretty as advertised. Also the fur is darker that on the picture."
2,Would not buy again,"Very hard ... not snuggly at all. The color is beautiful and it's soft, but stuffed too tight. More for decoration, not play."
5,This was exactly what we were looking for,"Our 6-month old was becoming bored with her current toys. Her new exciting activity has been exploration. We got the bear to give her something soft to climb on and it turned out to be so much more. She learned to sit on her own by using the bears lap to sit in by herself, the legs were a soft landing when she toppled over.Also, my much older children use the bear as a cushion for watching TV and playing video games. He is shaped much like a back support."
1,an ugly replacement compared to the picture shown of the product,"My bear has finally arrived and I had been decideing between two different bears as a photo prop and to let my daughter play with. After recieveing this produt i wished i had gone with the other bear this one is so ugly and it is NOT the same bear in the picture, I wouldnt even say its very big.... what a big waste of moey...."
2,Teddy Bear,I was a little disappointed in the actual size...the picture here makes the bear look bigger than it really is.
1,Dissapointing,"I ordered this bear for my son for Christmas, and was so excited for it to arrive. It got here and it was awful. The shape is weird, the shoulders and arms hang oddly, and the fur is not very nice at all. Also smaller than you would think based on the pictures. The feet are (as other reviewers stated) not separated into toes like in the picture. Overall I thought it looked like a cheap carnival prize, so I returned it. I was so bummed!"
1,"Wow, really expected better quality. What a let down.","All my son asked from Santa this year was a teddy. Since the only gift they get from us is the Santa gift, I wanted to make it special. First, it's so much smaller then the picture shows. Second, they way it's shipped is odd. It's shoved into a box that's long and skinny. This teddy isn't long and skinny. And it never really reshaped it's self once out of the box. Third and the MOST frustrating thing about this, withen a week or so of having it, the arm came off! Are you kidding me? And amazon says becuase it arrived 'ok' all they can do is have me send it back and get a partial credit for it. Really? I mean, Really? A partial credit for something used less then 30 days that rips apart? Really? What a regret. I thought for sure Mellisa and Doug would make better products then this. We have purchased so much from them in the past and never had a problem. Don't throw your money away."
2,Disappointed,"After reading all the reviews and looking at the photo provided of the bear, I was excited when I ordered this Bear. However I was majorly disappointed when it arrived. Looks nothing like the photo, not cute, too expensive. I feel as though I have wasted my money and time."
1,i am looking of a way to contact seller,i need to get a hold of the sellers. i live in japan on a military base. i am trying to buy these bears for the coaches of my sons team. they have named themselves the 'teddy bears!' sadly you say that you do not ship here. it is a fpo/ap address. i love these teddy bears and would really love to try and figure out a way to get them for the coaches. there are three. it is the perfect gift for all the work these single marines have invested in our kids on their own time. if there is anyone out there that knows of a way to contact the sellers will you please let me know..or if the sellers will contact me themselves. hoping to hear an answer back soon. thank you so much.
3,I should have measured first!,"This bear was MUCH larger in person than I anticipated; it's bigger than its owner. But he doesn't care, he loves the thing! He rolls around with it, uses parts of it as a pillow, etc. I was hoping for a big bear my son could tote around with him and this one is much too heavy, but he loves it anyway."
5,Giant bundle of fun,"Well this has lasted a year at my house and it still in the same condition. Here is what it has been though...Animals lay on it, my sons sleep or it or use it as a stool, my nieces will come over and feels the need to practice her karate on it and sometimes I will use it as a pillow when I am laying on the floor. Yes it sure can take a beating and does not look worse for wear. Would buy it again."
4,Great for ages 3 and up...,My daughter has wanted one of these for years she is now 11 and has never put this down since she got it Christmas Day. She sits with it behind her and leans on it when watching the TV. A much loved toy that can be handed down and is very durable. It also looks great on her bed.
4,"Cute, not very cuddly","My girlfriend wanted a teddy bear she could cuddle with while I was out of town. This bear seemed like a good choice, being that it's listed as being plush. The bear arrived, and he's very cute, but he's quite stiff, and his legs don't straighten out.I think this bear is great for kids, but if you're looking for something super cuddly, I would keep looking."
3,Meh. It's Ok.,"After reading the reviews and viewing customer images, I was actually hoping to receive the darker brown bear. What I received is exactly what is shown in the picture though. Because the primary purpose was to cuddle with it, I'm a little disappointed that it is stuffed in a sitting position and the legs do not extend. It's impossible to fit him under the covers and cuddle comfortably. It also came with a small hole in the right side of the neck, probably the location where they inserted the stuffing. The threads do not seem lose though, so I don't expect any more tearing. It's a little too firm for it's original intended purpose, but my kids (10 and 6 years old) love playing with it, and it's fairly comfortable to cuddle sitting in an upright position on the couch, so I guess I'll keep it."
2,Too Small,Quality of teddy bear was good but the picture was deceiving. Once the bear arrived it was much smaller than how it appeared in the picture. Dimensions for the bear were not listed either. If you are looking for a teddy bear larger than your elementary school aged child this is not the one.
5,perfect,"this was a wonderful deal and even better than expected, my granddaughter was very happy and that makes me happy!"
1,Should be called taxidermy bear,"The picture of this bear is very misleading. That must be the smallest kid in the world, because the bear is not that big. It's squat, smushed, and the fur is not that soft. The picture makes the bear looks like it would be soft and pliable, but it's not. The arms and legs stick straight out, stiff as a board. The feet don't look like that at all, and it's middle is hard. I bought this for my six year old for Christmas because all he wanted was a big stuffed bear. I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this product. I thought I could trust something from Melissa and Doug - usually very good quality. If you are expecting the bear pictured, go elsewhere. This is not what you get."
2,Not that great.,"I bought the bear for my wife as just a little pick me up. Anyhow, she like it at first, but its not something that she can cuddle with. The bear is too stiff and sheds like crazy. So, the idea was good, but it just does not work in the long run. Oh well."
2,poor quality,"i'm not sure what is wrong with this bear, but it seems like it is faulty. missing fur in places, one hand is backwards, the face and nose droop almost all the way down to the belly. horrible quality, the only reason why i didn't return it is because it's so big and return shipping is $$."
3,Huggable and very large,I bought this bear because of a suggestion from a cousin. I am newly alone and missed having someone to cuddle with in bed. Winston (the bear) is great for cuddling but is a terrible cover-hog because his legs do not straighten. He now sleeps on top of the covers.
5,Jumbo brown Teddy bear,"It was a Christmas present for my nephew's 5 year-old daughter,and she loves it! It looked to be well-made and is really big."
5,Melissa & Doug Jumbo Brown Teddy Bear - Plush,i bought this for a good friend of mine because she was having trouble sleeping and i knew she liked teddy bears and she loves it
5,A well loved bear!,"I never write reviews but after playing with our bear for the millionth time I thought I should. Granted our bear doesn't look exactly like the photo its still really big and brown and cute, it looks like a teddy bear and I agree with an another reviewer about having two right arms but it doesn't really matter. We get a lot of play with this bear every day, he hangs out on the floor in our living room and provides a mini jungle gym for our very active toddler. He gets jumped on, dragged around, he's the ultimate peek a boo!! We love him and feel like we totally got our money's worth!!"
4,Great film .. poor video quality,"Yes, I agree with everyone, the film is marvelous .... but the quality of the video is not.This DVD has a ""New, restored high-definition digital transfer, approved by director Peter Yates."" I don't know the technical terms .. but the ""black level"" is lousy. What should be totaly black gives the impression that the scene was filmed when it was raining.Normal daylight scenes look fine, but night time scenes do not. I guess we'll have to live with it."
3,Somewhat overrated,"The very dated soundtrack hurts this otherwise OK 70s crime drama. All the suspense scenes are marred by the hokey Dave Grusin score, which sounds like a dippy 1960s TV show. Some of the dialogue is spoken so quickly and mumbled that I found it hard to make out. Some have made a bit much of the Boston accents here. I'm from Massachusetts. Mitchum's accent isn't bad, but it's not fully real. His performance as the small-time crook-turned-rat who fears going back to jail is fine, but it's no Oscar winner. I did like the depiction of early 70s Boston and its suburbs, replete with many of the horrible vintage 60s and 70s Detroit autos of the period. Seeing them again made me shudder. This was based on what was probably George Higgins' best crime novel. I've never read it. Don't expect today's production values with this film. Everything moves a lot more slowly, and many shots needed tighter editing."
5,Great Classic,My wife and I loved this movie. It is a gritty tale of 70's low level gangsters in Boston. The screen play has a few twists and does not give away the plot. If you like Quentin Tarentino you'll like this movie.
1,Cumbersome waste of time,"The software is terribly buggy and unreliable. Had to send one disk back because the surface had bubbles and had to pay for the shipping cost. The software still won't run properly despite installation attempts on multiple computers and both Windows and Mac operating systems. For the price, the build quality is inexcusably shoddy."
1,No call back (beware),"I bought this board, (post to be new) recived the board gave it to the computer store to install into my system, (old board worked off and on) the store is telling me the board looks like it was used, or some one had tryed it, and the install book pages were looked at you can tell when you look and a new book if some one and looked and it, the pages have been folded open, thats what the computer store told me, there have build me many custom computers, there is not a dout in my mind the boad is bad and the person (guye) or what ever he is call, knew the board was junk, its been a week since I email him, this person is not very responible sell, and should be avoided."
5,THE ONLY BOOK YOU NEED ON POOLS,"If you want to buy 1 book to take you through everything you need to know about building a pool, this is the book to buy. The book explains all aspects of pool building allowing the reader to understand all aspects of pool construction, front start to finish."
4,"Book's fine, but same as one published by Southern Living",Be aware that this book and the book of the same title published by Southern Living are exactly the same book.
2,Not Practically Useful for Financial Forecasting,"While this book may be an interesting read from a purely intellectual point of view, it offers no practical advice in terms of investment decisions, other than to point out that financial markets can be volotile and risky - something which is obvious to any investor.A much more useful theory of fractals in the financial markets is ""The Elliott Wave Principle"" by Frost and Prechter (1978). For ""The Elliott Wave Principle"" actually posits a theory with predictive value and, hence, practical value to investors."
3,Limited use and only for advanced students of the market,"I enjoyed reading this book BUT had to reread some of my notes to really get the meaning and depth of the author's point. Yes, this book is creeping up on 8 years old and truly 2008-2009 did no favors to MPT but my concern is I haven't heard anyone talking about "" fractals"" and I work on Wall St. My fear is that this book makes investing seem like an equation and we have seen how that works out.. it's doesn't. There are other great reviews about the small details and flaws of this theory but that is exactly the problem, investing cannot be done using formulas or select time frames that support your theory. In summary, not sure how useful this book can be to investors or money managers."
4,Enjoyable read,"This book was enjoyable to read. It presented some new ideas that help to understand what to expect from the market and how to better judge risk. It points out a lot of issues with the math behind many of the current market tools used by Morningstar and other financial services.In the end it does not provide much insight into making money in the market. I have started utilizing the concept that volatility clusters to help time purchases. And it strengthened the concept that price changes have historical dependencies.The biggest benefit is to better understand how to protect your principal. The book it very defensive, but as long as you keep your principal, you can always get in on the next uptrend. That's much better than waiting for a large loss to recover."
3,Interesting but short on practical applications of theory.,"The topic is interesting and useful in the explanation of the unexpected. Did not seem to explain how fractals and ""fat tails"" could be used to predict or forecast. Essentially it comes across as an warning that the world is much more dangerous than most people assume."
3,Not There Yet,Intereting....but not fleshed out and since the individual buyers of stock are the turblance when turbulance occurs....well can there be a corrective?
3,interesting but hard to keep reading,"The book has an interesting idea, explaining about fractal geometry and randomness, including in financial markets. It's probably handy if you're trader, or if you want to explain market behaviour. Still, i find the book is very repetitive so it's boring and very hard for me to keep reading the book. i had to force myself to finish it. It's the only book that took me to finish in 2 weeks. ever!!!"
3,Tail Risk for the novice,Certainly much easier to read then a Financial Analyst's Journal article. Asks the questions although does not necessarily provide the answers. A must read for anyone talking to their financial advisors about portfolio construction based on the efficient markets hypothesis.
5,Insightful!!!!,"I learned about Fractals, not in high school as i should have done but in my graduate education.Benoit's work and application in finance is innovative. A must read for anyone who is interested in abstractness."
3,"Problem Awareness, But No Resolution","This book aptly points out flaws in the common methodologies for modeling the dynamics of markets. (In fact, it points them out, over, and over again throughout the book.) However, the book offers no solutions. Rather, its goal is to bring these flaws to the attention of readers who, presumably, will then be motivated to develop improved methodologies if they are researchers or, if they are practitioners, at least be made aware of the limitations. That goal is sufficient, I suppose, to warrant the writing of the book; it is indeed important to know the limitations of the models one is using to make decisions. However, I found the many re-iterations of the problem with no solution offered to be slightly frustrating. Among solutions, most notably absent was a solution from the field of fractals, which I was somewhat expecting given that the main author is given credit with inventing that field."
1,Where are Benoit's yachts?,"The proof of a pudding is in the eating. I long to see the transcripts from Mssr. Mandelbrot's broker demonstrating that his superior, brilliant and incandescent insight has resulted in un-dreamed of wealth for himself and his family and friends. Until then, mon ami..."
5,Genius and Ego Combined,"First you have to get around Benoit Mandelbrot's style, that being his strong use of the first person. Overall, this book is sheer brilliance, albeit with some flaws. As I never got the feeling that the author wanted everyone to think that he was right, I will not hold these incongruences against him. Over all, he takes the reader on a step by step analysis of the way in which financial markets move, and how the patterns that are seen are fractal in nature. Further, and this is the biggest take away, you cannot profit from a financial market by following trends, just by mitigating risk. It is in the last point that he breaks a few rules, especially by stating that the current risk models are wrong. My wish is that more people read his work, and start to incorporate is teaching in financial management. Perhaps the job of a fund manager is not over."
3,Interesting Read,I found Mandelbrots piece is fairly easy to read given the material he is attempting to cover. It points out the errors of many of the modeling techniques which exist. I always find this helpful as possibly the most important part of any modeling exercise is to know where your model falls short and what it might not be able to predict.
4,wrap bandages - elastic,this wrap bandage is okay - not as good as the doctor gives you but better than the ace with the clips.
1,Ol' Reliable: He's Always Wrong!,"I love Richie Unterberger. He can usually be counted on to get the facts straight but when it comes to critical evaluation he's always wrong! If he thinks something is impenetrable or unlistenable -Scott Walker's ""Tilt"" comes to mind- chances are it's worth checking out. He's tone-deaf when it comes to nuance, as witness his review at All Music Guide of -just off the top of my head- Susan Pillsbury's sole record. He's the Roger Ebert of music criticism, a man with a tiny bit of street cred which he uses mostly to endorse a comfortably ""alternative"" canon, one that excludes really challenging, innovative or unclassifiable accomplishments."
5,a superb book!,"unterberger is probably my favorite music writer, his tastes most closely resemble my own. he's right when he says that there were many, many great groups in the 60's that DIDN'T make it. there were (in my estimation) very very few truly bad bands in the 60's and early 70's- most groups had something going for them. if you like this era, you should also try mr. unterberger's other book on obscure rock greats. this book profiles interesting to sublime performers like the bonzo dog band, tim buckley, and fred neil, to name just three. hopefully unterberger will continue to produce books on musical figures from this halcyon period."
4,Long live the Bonzo Dog,"What I care about, what's important to me, is that the Bonzos are here. Anything that keeps the Bonzos, especially Vivian Stanshall, alive in any way, is a-ok in my book. Is this book a good book? I wouldn't really know, not caring much for books of this sort. I bought it for the Bonzos."
4,he he he...,"Yeah, this one is probably one of the creepiest movies i have ever seen.Where a seemingly alien bactieria can transform other living things into parts of it's own body? crazy.But really smart. All in all, a good movie."
2,Okay Movie,"The movie is just okay, mildly entertaining. Perfect movie for sale on Amazon but I would not pay to see it in a movie theatre. Great experience with the seller, the movie arrived on time and perfect condition."
5,A great way to lay a math foundation.,"This program is so easy to use and a lot of fun! My daughter just loves it! We usually sit down on the family room floor and play each day with the items listed in the teachers guide. She is learning math concepts without even really realizing it. At first, I thought the calendar part was kind of silly, but I am so impressed that my 5 year old now knows the days of the week, can tell you today's date, and is learning the months of the year in order. I recommend that you purchase the manipulatives set. It costs around $60 (through Saxon or Sonlight), but can be used through 3rd grade. We use items from it every day."
3,"Plays good, lousy artwork",This CD plays well (and the music on the CD is fabulous) but there is no artwork or jewel box. The CD itself is scuffed: I would not have had the nerve to sell an item looking like this
4,A very solid version of Phantom,"Of all the versions of Phantom of the Opera I have heard, so far this one is the most opera-like in terms of the singing voices. This helps to really bring out the operatic qualities of the score, moreso than, say, the Canadian or London cast recordings. The orchestrations and arrangements are pretty right on as well, not too overdone or too wimpy. I don't quite understand why the guy playing the Phantom decided to start out his solo in ""Das Phantom Der Oper"" an octave lower than written. It was an interesting choice, but what exactly was the point? Thankfully, he took it back up the octave for the chorus. Overall he is a good actor but a little more ""baritone-ish"" than I prefer. Go ahead and give it a shot; at the very least you'll get to learn the Phantom in a new language."
1,Phantom Gone Bad!!!,"This has got to be the WORST recording of 'The Phantom of the Opera' EVER!If you're going to buy a recording I strongly recommend the 'Original Cast' or the 'Canadian Cast',both of these have a superb cast with excellent leads."
2,bummer,"You think you are getting some quality smoked salmon, but mostly you are getting a bunch of canned salmon products (7 cans). Just a little actual smoked salmon. For the price, kinda disappointing."
2,Paint Chipped,When mounting the the wall plate the paint chipped away at both mounting points....didn't have this problem with any of the plates purchased at the local big box store. I repainted the plate with some white spray paint I had around the house....easier than trying to return it.
5,Love NE,Love this CD I play it over and over again. Never get tired of the old joints. Reasonable price too!
4,Another great compaltion,"This Cd was a great compaltion that was released in 1991 when New Edition and all of it's members were on top of the music scene.The CD features every major hit the group is known for and even goes back to the Maurice Starr days. I would have added the songs You're Not My Kinda Of Girl, Helplessy In Love and Supernatural to the compalation but all in all it's a great compalation."
2,Don't waste your money,"I'm a huge NE fan, so when I purchased this album I was so excited but after listening to it, I could've played better music myself. You can tell that the cd was done with keyboard programming. The sax was the only instrument that was played by an actual person, and the rest of the programming was horrible. If you have the rest of NE's albums, you don't need this CD, unless you just want to add it to your collection."
4,Bubble gum music you don't have to be ashamed to love,"Okay, okay, so we all know that the Jackson Five were the original ""Boy Band"" trendsetters.Singing teeny-bop songs and breakin' it down with cool dance moves would be a formula New Edition pimped and passed along to Boyz II Men, New Kids On the Block, N-Sync, Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees and any other boy-band I missed.I can honestly say, however, it's still cool 2 say you liked New Edition (which I'm sure ain't being said about all of the aforementioned groups, LOL).This LP is the one to own because it really does have all of their greatest hits.The love ballad ""Can You Stand the Rain"" is a classic, classic jam I think still sums up what real men are looking for in wifey material (among other things, LOL).""Boys to Men,"" ""Mr. Telephone Man,"" ""Candy Girl"" and ""Popcorn Love"" all sound dated, but if you're into this kind of R&B; music you'll still enjoy hearing oldies but goodies one more time.Recommended purchase."
5,A wonderful singer,"Listen Daily, I love his voice !!The wonderful voice is no more, but with his songs, we can relive his memory"
4,GOOD MUSIC,I love the sound of this CD lots of good music to dance to.I can't play this CD to much at work I find myself dancing more then working.shipping was on time the next thing knew it was at my door.
3,Silent Cat 120 Cm Fan,"Silent Cat 12 Cm FanQuiet fan ,air flow is weak , Suitable for the use andinstallation in Mini PC Case .I would advise not installed in middle and Full Tower PC Case ."
5,Money well spent!,I bought this and another brand 120mm fan. This thing is pretty quiet I have it hooked up to my fan controller an can turn it full blast and I cant hear it at all compared to my grfx card fan. also much quieter than the other 120 I bought at the same time. if your looking for a quiet fan this is it. and decently priced. only thing is how long will it last? Hopefully forever...
5,Shot Down,"I used to watch this before I was ,arried I would always leave the future wifes home with enough time to make it to mine and open a cold one and watch Scott Brady do his thing. With the advent of DVDs we can now watch those c;assics of the past( sometimes fond memories are the way to go) in this case great stuff and cheap western fans get out the plastic.

3,Shotgun Slade,"This is what I asked for. I was looking for it,you had it and it was at a good price. Good service.Thanks"
5,Performs its jobs dutifully,"Everything I've needed this tool for has been successfully handled. The wire cutting and stripping works exactly as expected, and I don't know what else I could've asked for."
5,Great Product,"The tool is well designed and does it's job well. I got this for working with electronics, and it has worked great."
5,Woah!!,"this is more of a review for the delivery service! ordered it on Thursday morning and it was on my doorstep on Friday morning. That is just amazing service my amazon.On the product, well it looks very sturdy and the build quality is just TOP notch. from a quick look, looks like there are loads of options in it. I am an electrical engineering student and wanted to buy something cool and handy that i know i will definitely need not just for lab works(since the wire cutter in the lab is in a very poor condition)..but for the home too. Couldn't be happier with this purchase."
4,Very well made and gets the job done.,"These are a very solid wire multi tool. Just a very solid product from a great brand. Oh, these are very sharp. I was amazed at how easy it cut and striped the 12 AWG speaker wire I just bought."
5,good value,"very well made at a good price, print on tool is easy to read. not much else to say. they work well."
2,got dull very quickly,Been on a job site at a mega church in jacksonville. We installed about ten tt patchbays each 96 points. these strippers were useless after the 6th patchbay was done. if you do alot of electrical work dont get these they will get dull fast. They are probably fine for the average home owner though.
4,Works well but not quite what I was looking for,"This isn't the fault of the product but I'm a new homeowner (and a girl that spent decades living in apartments - hello maintenance men!!) so I'm slowly building up a decent tool set. This product totally works and is very solid but in my ignorant mind it wasn't what I was looking for. I wanted something that could cut through zip-ties and other fastening devices. This isn't quite it. I'll keep it around for when I master home maintenance and I want to re-wire the house, alone, by myself. Shudder the thought."
4,not bad,it was half the price of the Klien stripper and is almost the same. i didn't expect the handles to be hard though but it doesn't bother me
5,A Contemporary Jazz Great,"I bought this album because I heard 'Room with a view', which contains one of the most incredible sax solos i've ever heard. Yellowjackets display their virtuosity on this album, particularly on tracks such as 'Sightseeing' 'Room with a view' and 'Indigo'- it's a real pleasure to listen to such intricate, tight and beautiful music played by really spectacular musicians.This album is so exciting because the band really explored different aspects of music, 'Wildlife' is almost minimalist in parts and illustrates how syncopation, cross rhythms and world beats can combine to great effect, producing endlessly fascinating music.Every track on this album is unique and special, you must get this!!!"
5,The Best Account of Churchill Extant,"Controversial when it came out because Lord Moran violated every rule of patient confidentiality imaginable and became soundly despised by the Churchill family, this is still the very best book about what Churchill was really like."
5,Does anybody know where this man is?,This man has a dynamic voice! He has also done duets with various artist. I would love to know the artist and the names of the songs he's performed with them. I would love to here from this man again!!
2,Not all that great,"Sorry, but I don't like this album too much. 4 Out of 11 tracks (2,6,7,10)are quite good, but the rest are duds. However, I don't think that Mr. Peaston's singing is to blame, but the lousy material he has to work with. His previous album, Introducing David Peaston is an excellent recording. It demonstrates that if Mr. Peaston only had half the talent he does, he could more than hold his own against artists like Brian McKnight, Luther Vandross, or Babyface. Maybe if he started writing more like the aforementioned artists, he could have done more in his singing career. Mr. Peaston has only co-written a total of two songs between these two albums, and I think these are some of the better songs on which they appear. Who knows? Maybe he'll surprise us with something new. We can only hope."
3,The title is inaccurate but the book has good content.,"The secondary title is much more accurate: ""How to Build a Low-Cost Home."" The author has great experience constructing earth-sheltered homes. This means digging a hole on flat property, building a box in the hole and piling dirt up against the walls. Mr. Roy gives detailed examples of how a sod roof should be constructed, and what problems to watch out for. In this way, it is like an episode of ""This Old House"" because you get to see the intimate details of the building construction. The book certainly lives up to the ""low-cost"" title, because the properties developed in the book were completed by young middle-class owners who could not afford to take out bank loans and mortgages. The author has built many earth-sheltered homes of this sort and even teaches others how to do it professionally. On that note, the book comes from a smart and well-qualified author. Just don't be fooled by the title given by the publishing company"
3,not for those looking for truly underground,"the book had some good points. I was very dissapointed though. in the description, it describes the two differnt types of underground houses, an earth sheltered house and one that is truly underground. I purchased for the info on truly underground homes, however there wasnt an example of any one building one or how to do so, just the earth sheltered house the author built. If your looking for completly underground, this isnt the book for you. For example the earth sheltered house the author describes in detail wouldnt have the same isues with ventilation that truly underground would have. The summary was misleading and for the price I wouldnt have bought it."
5,"Understand ""why?"" not just ""what.""","You open a Bible and examine it with a Jehovah's Witness and you get nowhere! What do you do? A beginning point is to get your hands on Bowman's book.Bowman explains some basic logical and interpretive principles and then digs into the differences between JW and Christian ways of looking at the same Bible passage. The JW's method of Bible interpretation is shown to be dictated by the Watchtower and Bible Tract Society.Bowman examines the New World Translation of the JW's, their belief system, and their use of ""Jehovah"" as their name for God. He offers a sample, technical case study of interpreting Luke 23:43. The book closes with appendices on the New World Translation and a word study on ""stake"" vs ""cross."" Bowman also includes an excellent annotated bibliography.Bowman's purpose is not to attack, but to help Jehovah's Witnesses find truth. Read his book and absorb his insights."
2,Full of mistakes,"It appears that some fool edited the cautionary examples for correctness. (p. 34) The grammar is poor (""verboten"" as a noun? (p. 85)), and the usage is non-standard (Commas are ""trundled out""? (p.37)). Some passages are self-contradictory (""With Adjectives, p. 37).This book is not a total disaster, but I can hardly recommend it."
1,Abysmal.,"Cappon's book is sloppy, rushed, and incomplete. I can't recommend it to anyone.The same Pope quotation is trotted out twice (p. 34 & p. 76), the second time clumsily, and both times Cappon renders it incorrectly.Page 40's entry on commas in series includes a misspelling (""stuf"") and a violation of the rule covering capitalization after a colon (which can be found on p. 28).The ""Hands Off"" warning from the chapter on quotation marks is dogmatic about handling speech in its raw form: ""Grammatical and other errors are the speaker's problems, not yours."" Yet what practicing journalist transcribes every ""um,"" ""uh,"" and false start the recorder captures?When a book that purports to help writers offers more in the way of hindrance--and can't trouble itself to take its own advice--it can only be judged a failure.This is another post-Strunk & White writing guide that prizes brevity over clarity and cuteness over completeness. If the AP wants a useful punctuation guide, it should start from scratch."
4,Decent reference,"There's no mystery here, and it's not intended to be a grammatically pristine work of art. It is, after all, a 96-page reference manual. If you are used to writing/editing literary and academic styles and need to refresh your memory on the punctuation variables in journalistic writing, this is an easy point-to reference that won't take up any more of your precious time than absolutely necessary."
3,Book was as described,The book was as described and in perfect condition upon receipt to my home. Thank you for having this item in great condition!
5,Love this book!,"As a writer, this book is a wonderful asset. I don't know why I didn't purchase it sooner. I highly recommend this book to writers and teachers."
1,Poor Playback Reliability,"We purchased the Coby DVD-227 because of its price: $19.95 after rebate. However, it pauses the DVD intermittently during play. It will pause any where from 10-30 seconds. It then continues on. During Spderman 2, it paused 2 times. During 13 Going on 30, it paused 3 times. Very annoying. And, to make matters worse, the store we bought it at has an exchange only policy.My mother always said ""You get what you pay for."""
2,One song in mind,"Honestly, I only purchased this item for only one song which I've had in mind for so long. The rest of his tracks aren't good at all but everyone has a different taste in music. It was an okay buy."
3,"A kids dream, a parents nightmare!","Our twin girls got this table for their first birthday, and loved it! I noticed a couple of days later that the little phone that comes with it was actually suppose to make noise too (which it didn't). I changed the batteries and that didn't help so I gave up. Then one day out of the blue I put the phone on it's craddle and it started working, for about five minutes, then didn't work again. From there on it only worked maybe two or three more times. Now all of the sudden it started working but it does it when no one is touching it or anywhere near it and it did it in the middle of the night! I woke up thinking someone was in the house! We now keep the phone away from the table. other than that and the fact that it's a battery hog it's a good toy, although you do have to watch your kids around it because it is NOT sturdy at all it tips over very easy."
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased this gift for my 1 year old nephew. Its cute, but I don't think it will stay in one piece for long. All he wants to do is jerk Elmo's head and bang the cylinder. The plastic is more on the thin side and Elmo looks weird. Not worth the cost!"
2,Very Disappointed,"We received this as a gift for our daughter. She is now 9 months old and within 2 weeks of playing with it (again, she is 9 months old) elmo's head broke. The table no longer operates as all electrical is centered in Elmo's head.A toy that we were very excited about turned out to be a dud."
2,Sing & Teach Table of Annoyance!,This toy plays when no one is in the room and it tips over easily when he is standing by it. The songs are fun for baby and the gadgets are good too. The phone and the cookie monster do not work.Not my best purchase.
4,worst product quality,"i bought a new ""elmo sing and teach table"" for my daughter. when i recieved it, i was shocked after looking at its condition. there were too many scratches and the toy was all dirty. elmo don't rock with songs becuase its connection wire was already broken when i took it out of the box.i never expected to get that kind of service.i'm really disappointed with the product quality."
4,Good toy but could be a litte sturdier,My daughter loves this toy but I think it could be a little sturdier. I have to be there sitting behind her when she is playing it b/c she trys to pull herself up and then it tips.. Even when she standing playing with it I have to hold the legs down.
2,"Cute, but dangerous.","I bought this table for my son's first birthday. Needless to say, he loved it, but everytime he leaned or pushed on the table at all it tipped over. Its three leg design is very unstable. Also by the second day, Cookie Monster only work part of the time. It broke my heart to take it back because he loved it so much, but it was just too dangerous. I exchanged Elmo for the Leapfrog learning table. He loves this new table!! It works beautifully and it never tips over. Skip this toy until they redesign the legs or just go for the Leapfrog."
4,No Problems So Far,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this toy is best supported against a wall or somethig because of the three legs.Other than that it is all good, fun and functional with no problems and only happy playtime for Emma!"
2,cell phone doesnt work,my son received this toy for christmas this year. i noticed that everything worked except to little cell phone part. it disapointed me because he loves the toy so much.
5,A GREAT TOY!,This toy is GREAT! My 15 month old son recieved it for christmas and he LOVES it! Its so cute the way Elmo moves back and forth and the ernie teaches babies SO MUCH! My son was so excited when we put it together he wouldnt leave it alone! The 3 legs have not been a problem for him with the balance of the toy like others have wrote but maybe because hes been walking for awhile! Overall I would rate this toy 5 STARS! Would recommened it to anyone!
2,Not sturdy at all,"I bought this for my 10 month old daughter who is begining to stand on her own. This toy is not sturdy enough for her when she pulls up to stand. When leaning on it, it will fall, not supporting her at all. I like the gizmos that are attached but I had to return it due to the safety factor."
2,Great but...,"This toy was great, my 1 yr old loved it and would play endlessly which was great except after 2 weeks it broke. We returned and got another which lasted 2.5 wks. A true let down for both of us. This is actually the 3rd Fisher Price toy to have an extremely short life."
4,Hours of fun,"We purchased this toy for my daughter when she was 7 months old.She is now 10 months, and has been playing with this toy non-stop for the last 3 months. She loves dancing to the songs and hearing the voices of all her favorite characters. The only bad thing I have to say is that Cookie Monster stops working periodically. Other than that, this toy has provided tons of fun time for little one and tons of sanity for Mom and Dad!"
2,4 is better than 3,"I must echo and warn against the 3 leg design. We have to stand w/ our 12 month old the whole time because when she leans on it, it falls over. We have debated trying to screw all the legs to a board to keep it upright. She has a blast with it, but too much work for mom & dad. As far as the reports about phones and other things breaking, we have had some success putting in new batteries."
1,Fell apart the moment I assembled it...,"I am very dissapointed with this toy! I just bought it this morning and my son (11 month) smiled really big while I assembled it. I wasn't impressed by the 3 thin plastic legs and it started to move back the moment my son started playing. 5 minutes later the cellphone wasn't working anymore. Also the moving Elmo Head isn't very durable, my son only had eyes for the moving Elmo head and after a couple of minutes he took the whole thing apart. My son is almost 30 inches tall and he was on his knees while playing with the table. When he was standing he had to bend down to play with it. We will take the toy back later and find a better table that is safer for him to play with!"
3,Tippy,"Our 18 lb. 1-year old rec'd this for a birthday present. She seems to enjoy it, but it is very tippy and kind of annoying. Elmo talks even when our baby isn't playing with it and the off switch is not easily accessible.We like our Fisher Price Laugh and Learn table much better."
3,"Fun, but not sturdy enough","My 10 month old loves this toy that he got for Christmas. Unfortunately, we quickly discovered that it is not sturdy enough to support his weight. When he tried to pull himself up, it often fell on top of him. The worst incident was when he leaned forward and it could not support his weight. He went head first, hitting his mouth on some part of it, and unfortunately lost a front tooth!! He loves it so much though, we still allow him to play with it, but not until we have it firmly anchored, and ensure that it is not able to topple over, either way.In hindsight, I would not recommend it unless they either made it more stable, or increased the age recommendation to be a bit older (when the tots are less wobbly)."
2,Disappointed,"My 18 month old daughter was thrilled to receive this as a Christmas gift. However, Elmo stopped moving his head after a few days of use and the telephone feature never worked from day one. Table features are geared more toward the 12 month old child. I was expecting a much more interactive table."
2,Most Annoying toy ever!,I thought this would be very educational for my 18 month. . but she constantly hits the buttons without listening to the entire song. All this toy does is play songs. How boring and uneducational is that!!? It is also very loud. I would get this for babies who are just trying to stand by themselves and who are just started to push things. My daughter just might be too old for it already.
2,Dangerous for Toddlers,"My 9 month old daughter received this for Christmas and loves it - however she quite easily knocks it forward or it falls backwards on her. Also, we have changed the batteries and still several of the buttons do not seem to work. There is a competitor's product that has 4 legs that I do recommend though because she is not able to fall down with it."
2,Poorly Made and Scary,"My 17 month old was playing happily with the table until the Cookie Monster GROWLED at her! She burst into tears. Then a few minutes later while she was playing with something on the other side of the room it Growled again. Now she is scared to go near it. Add to that the legs keep falling off, the ABC spinner doesn't work, and Elmo's head is a very cheap looking imitation- and this toy is going right back to the store."
2,TABLE NOT STURDY ENOUGH!,My little girl is 11 months old and has hurt herself trying to pull up on this toy. There isn't enough support from the toy to handle babies learning to stand or pull up. This toy will fly forward if too much weight is added to it. It has also caused my daughter to fall backwards from lack of support. I don't recommend this toy to any child who cannot stand on his or her own!
5,Fun & Enjoyable Toy,"I bought this toy for my son when he was 8 months old and he loved it from the start. One month later he is still enjoying it and plays with it every day. It is a fun toy, although I wish it was more sturdy since he likes to pull himself up on it. I'm not sure it is worth the $40 advertised price, but Amazon had it on sale for $9.95 + $10 shipping and that was definately worth it. Overall it is a wonderful toy that is getting much use!"
2,"Not sturdy, very annoying","My nine-month-old daughter just recieved this table from her grandmother. She's been pulling her up to stand for a little over a month on our furniture, but this toy slides when she attempts to pull herself up on it. I have to hold onto legs as she plays with it. When she gets excited while she's standing, it easily moves and makes her unstable. Our floors are hardwood and I did try this on a thick yoga mat and on carpet, which gave it more stability while she's standing, however, it doesn't have enough weight/balance to the design for her to pull herself up with it tipping forward."
5,Great product,I bought this for a friend's child (1 year)and she said he absolutely loves it. She said it's easy for him to use and it's his favorite toy. She said he dances with the music and it's a big hit. I was so impressed I bought it for my 1 year old nephew as well and received the same response from my sister. Great toy.
2,Not Pleased,"My 9 month old enjoys playing with this toy, so I'm extremely disappointed that it just isn't safe. First of all, the legs are not sturdy. Several times now he's ended up on the floor with this toy on top of him. IT IS FLIMSY!! Plus, I've had to return it TWICE now because both times one of the toys on it just didn't work (each time was a different toy). I don't think the wiring was right on them. Anyway, I've returned it for something else. I'm sure there are other toys that he'll enjoy AND will be safe."
1,"great idea, but too dangerous","We bought this for our daughter for Christmas, and it was her favorite toy. However, within the first 5 minutes she fell over with it and it fell on top of her. Everyday, she fell with it. She loves to rock back and forth to the music, but the toy only has three legs and the slightest shift in weight made it topple over. I've reported this to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and they immediately wanted to come and take to toy to test it. I urge you to wait to see if Fisher-Price changes it before you buy it. My daughter wasn't hurt, but I don't want to see any child get hurt by this toy."
1,Do Not Buy unless your child has excellent balance!!,"I bought this for my 9 month old, he is able to pull up, stand and cruise but his balance is still unsteady. When he stands at the table to play and goes to move or he shifts his weight the table tips and he either falls on his face over it or sideways with the table On top of him! It only has 3 legs and is very unsteady! I contacted fisher Price to Complain, I bet you will see a recall soon!!"
5,Keep their attention!!!,"My son got this toy for his first birthday. He's now 18 months and still loves it! When he first got it, he immediately began to dance to the music. You can press certain body parts on Ernie and then he sings about them (i.e. eyes, mouth, ears).My son can now identify his ears, mouth and eyes on himself. Great toy!"
3,Wished it had 4 legs instead of 3,"My daughter got this toy when she was about 10 months old. She would fall when trying to lean on the toy while playing. I felt it was too unsteady on 3 legs and may have been better with 4. Otherwise, she loved it and now the tippiness of this toy is not an issue now that she is a stable toddler."
2,Cute but not sturdy!,"My daughter received this for Christmas. It looked great in the store and it has lots of fun songs and features. She likes the Cookie Monster snack cup and the removable phone the best. One problem that I'm concerned with is that the table topples over easily. If my daughter puts any weight on it by pulling herself up or leaning on it, the table falls over and she falls with it. She hasn't been hurt but it is a little scarey. I wedged it in a corner up against sturdy objects and furniture and that has temporarily remedied the problem. I highly recommend that the manufacturer change the style and add another leg to make it more sturdy!"
1,Faulty toy.,"We purchased the Elmo table this weekend. When we put it together, Cookie Monster did not work. Also, the motor that makes Elmo's head move was so loud, you couldn't hear the songs! When we returned to the store, we were told that it was the fourth return for the same reasons. Spend you money elsewhere, this toy is a piece of junk."
2,Not safe for young children,"I purchased this for my daughter who is pulling herself up to standing, but not able to stand on her own yet. I was so disappointed because right away she fell over!! The toy is not sturdy at all. She has hurt herself a couple of times so I have had to put it away. My 2 year old loves it. But it is not safe for a child who would lean on it."
5,Vikki,"My son is 11 months old and we have had this toy for about 2 months and it is absolutely adorable, and keeps him entertained....i would recommend this for any child, its awesome!"
3,"love the toy, when it works","My daughter loves this toy unfortunately the electronic components do not work very well. The cookie monster and telephone ""voice"" do not always work which is VERY disappointing. Plus I can't even attempt to get to the electronic wiring the way the table is constructed. (I find faulty wiring a very common problem with FP toys. I'm having the same difficulty with the Learning Home). Once you put all the components together, you can't take it apart. This is very annoying because now I have to go out and BUY a new box to ship it back. I can't believe FP had the nerve to ask me to pay for shipping for their faulty product. They were ""kind"" enough to provide a prepaid shipping label after I complained severely to customer support. I recommend that parents test out all the features before attaching the elmo head and legs."
2,Cool toy!! Not built with a toddler in mind.,My grandson loves the table. But when he walks around or lean in to the table it falls over. I will be taking it back and find one like it to replace the Elmo one. Leapfrog has gotten very good reviews.Not a product I would tell friends about.
2,Elmo table...very disappointed!,"I wish i had read these reveiws before purchasing our elmo table! The cell phone and abc rolling drum does not work. Table is very easily tipped over and my 17 month old has to be on his knees to play with it, its very short. I guess we will be returning this as well."
1,safety hazard elmo,My baby loved this toy. He looks like a mini DJ with all the cool songs to mix-up. The elmo head stopped working in the first week. We waited to put the legs on until he could stand and we were surprised to find out how dangerous the table was. If a child leans on the table for support it tips. I was not happy with the bruise on the back of my son's head when the leg caught him on the way down. It is a great toy if the company would re-design the legs to support a childs weight.
4,Elmo's Sing and Teach Table,"My son got this table when he was 1 year old and already walking. It was a hit for about the first week or so but lost its new toy intrigue shortly thereafter. I found that the kids in our playgroup who were not yet walking liked the toy alot more because they could pull up on it and stand with it playing. Therefore, I think that the manufacturer recommended age should be modified because children who are older will get bored too quickly with the toy. If you have a child just learning to stand or almost standing, this would be the perfect toy to encourage them, otherwise, dont buy it. Should you buy this table though, be sure to buy plenty of batteries, as I found ours was a battery hog!"
5,Daughter Loved it and had nothing but fun and dancing w/it,"It was my daughter's first B-day gift, she loves it and always plays with it. Eats her cheerios in the snack bowl. Has different dances with the different songs. We have not faced any other problems with it."
4,A bit unsteady but worth every penny,My 9 1/2 month old son loooves this. He also has the leap frog table which was about $40 more and loves them equally. Only downside is the Elmo is on 3 legs and is tippy when he's rough on it. About once every other day it flies over... sometimes on top of my son. Because of this INTENSE supervision is required....but if you're willing to hang out in the room and hover like a hawk in case it flips over... your kid will have a BLAST. I guess I don't like that the cell phone and cookie cup come off... we keep losing them. Bur the wiggling Elmo and great sounds are worth it. It's easier on batteries than my Leapfrog table
4,my baby likes this toy...,"This toy is good as far as keeping his attention and entertained. I didn't give it five stars because it moves when my baby (He's 10 months) leans on it. They should have put some kind of grip on the bottom so it could stay put on the floor instead of moving along with him. Other than that, it's good."
5,What a fun toy.!!!!,I gave this toy to my son for his 1st birthday.He stands at it for hours.i put cereal in cookie monsters mouth and he loves to open it and find little surprises.Great for babies that are already walking. Toy is not to load so it doesnt drive the parents crazy.
1,Not recommended,"AGE: 2-6FORMAT: Short, first-person stories with lots of illustrations per story.FAITHFULNESS: Heavy revision and expurgation of Biblical texts to remove anything remotely unpleasant. Only vaguely accurate with large amounts of rather idiosyncratic interpretations.ILLUSTRATIONS: Bright but bland illustrations. Substandard.USEFULNESS: I would NOT recommend this based upon the inaccuracy of the text. It isn't even especially attractive, nor are the stories told well.Substitute:The Rhyme Bible Storybook or Family-Time Bible"
5,The best Bible for toddler,"I searched a while before purchasing a Bible for my 2 year old son. He loved this one from the beginning. It is his favorite book right now. I liked it because of the 10 word per page limit. The characters are big, expressive and colorful. The essence of the story is captured in a way a toddler can relate. Hands down, it's the best way to introduce Bible characters to your children."
5,"""Please read the Bible to me!""","My three year old son asks to have this book read to him over and over again. He enjoys the simple ""page turning"" suspense in the stories. He will even sit still for the ENTIRE book (a major feat). This Bible will give young preschoolers & toddlers a basic understanding of Bible stories and get them familiar with its major characters."
4,Fresh Flowers,Flowers were beautiful and not broken. The only negative would be they did not last very long.
5,"According to my mom,"" very unique, beautiful arrangement of flowers!""","This was delivered to my mom in NY on her birthday. She just loved it! ""Something I have never seen, very unusual, undescribably beautiful piece of flower arrangement."" She enjoyed it whole day with her friends. ""I wanted share the joy of looking at these beautiful flowers."" So she took it to her pastor next day. He also loved it. After hearing the story, I was happy that this bouquet made many people happy."
5,Other customer reviews were right on!,"Prior to purchasing these flowers for Mother's Day, I read the other customer reviews and I have to tell you they were right on. They gave glowing reviews of the speed of delivery and the quality of the flowers when they arrived.My Mom commented several times on how great they looked long after their arrival. You can be sure you are ordering a quality product when you order these flowers."
2,Poor Customer Service,"I loved the flowers, HOWEVER, there was an error in the order and I was unable to reach any live person to correct it, even though I wrote an email and left several voice mails an hour after the order was placed. I am still waiting for a refund for the order placed in error, and will soon have to battle for it I guess. I have used this company in the past and like their product, but not being able to contact anyone to change the order was most unsatisfying. If I do not get the promised refund I will not use this vendor again."
4,Very Nice Boquet,"When I ordered this Boquet on line I was a little sceptical. What would it look like when it arrived? What condition would it be when it got here. I was surprised to say the least. It was beautiful, all the flowers were fresh and my wife really enjoyed her Mother's Day gift.Thank you Amazon for a job well done. You have a happy customer."
5,sent flowers to Mom for her birthday...,...and I'd waited until the last minute. Falcon Farms still got them to her on time. And they were exceptionally beautiful.
5,Exelent service,"I sent the Bouquet to my sister for the last hollydays she was very happy even they sent me a picture with the very nice flowers they had and I'm very happy to send it/The price was very accesesible, thank you very muchTeddy Asch"
4,Pleasing New Source for Flowers,"Nature's Best BouquetI had this bouquet sent to my mother for Mother's Day. They arrived on time, in excellent condition. My mother was thoroughly pleased and consequently so was I. The bouquet is colorful and the price was excellent. Great product for the money. Will have no hesitation in ordering the same through Amazon in the future.Nature's Best Bouquet"
5,Astounded in Every Way,"I'm not given to adjectival extravagances but simply must go there with regard to these flowers, the seller's packaging and the speed of delivery.I ordered the flowers for my girlfriend on the night of 10/10 and the flowers got there today, 10/12. Wow, utterly amazing! The packaging, my girlfriend said, was extremely good: very heavy duty box, flowers well protected, and there was an icepack in the box to help keep flowers cool and fresh. Then we come to the flowers themselves. All I can say is that my girlfriend gushed; said that the color combinations were beautiful, the flowers were in perfect shape without a hint of wilting, browning, or trauma of any kind. She absolutely loved them.I cannot recommend these flowers, this seller, enough. I'm exceedingly impressed and WILL buy from them again!!!"
1,Never delivered; horrible customer service,"I would give this company zero stars if I could. I purchased these flowers for my grandmother's birthday, but she never received them. When I contacted the company's cutomer service, I was told that the flowers were delivered, but no one was home, so they were left at the front door of the house (company doesn't have a receipt signature policy). I was also told that I cannot receive a refund or a delivery with signature. As far as I know any reputable company would leave a note to pick up their item from the local USPS if no one is home and would not leave it at the door. Hopefully Better Business Bureau resolves this issue."
5,These flowers are FANTASTIC!,The flowers were amazing. I will always try to use Falcon Farms from now on. Absolutely outstanding!
4,A classic on Chinese local politics in Malaysia,"This book presents an in-depth and detailed account of Chinese local politics in multi-racial Malaysia, based on an intensive anthropological field research conducted by the late author. It is both about Chinese politics in a macro and micro contexts. The issues teased out by this brilliant monograph provide a window on the construction of Chineseness at the 'everyday-defined' level in Malaysia. A must read for those interested on the Chinese diaspora."
2,battery monster,"VR-399 is not practice. ""Play"" key is very bad. Pause period is not enough. Battery life is short. Record quality is not bad but this product is not support windows xp (SP-2). If you're a journalist, It's not for you."
3,It was ok,"This sled isnt the beast but not the worst. Its one of those things that may work or may not. The wax worked but not greatly. If someone had a lot of thiongs on the liust, dont get it but if like, 8 opr less adre on then put in like 5th or 6th on the pririty liust. Wouldnt generallry recommened but if im feeling nice, i might."
3,Okay,"This was an okay read. Personally I thought the book was too long and if I had to hear ""Lawd quit"" one more time I thought I would scream. I also hate it when authors stress designer names for EVERYTHING down to the makeup. I thought the story started off good but buy the middle of the book it became tiring. Why in all of these books do the heroine always run out before getting the entire story. When I started reading this book I wanted to get Chloe and Devon's book but I don't think so."
4,A STORY WITH RAW EMOTIONS,"I was hooked at the first encounter between Anika & Deshawn. And the sexual encounter was nothing short of HOT. I found myself cheering for Deshawn & his committment to truly fulfilling his love for Anika. He was very creative in his pursuit. This was a powerful loving-to-hate-the-one-you-love love story.It captured the RAW emotions of finding & conquering love. I laughed, cried, and my heart leaped until the last page.NIOBIOA BRYANT CAPTURED THE RAW EMOTIONS OF FINDING LOVE & LOSING IT BY IMMATURITY. IMMATURITY HAS NO PLACE IN LOVE.LOVE CONQUERED LOVE.THANKS NIOBIA FOR A GOOD READ."
4,Twins & Friends,I just finished this book and not sure how I missed it since I have all of Ms Bryant's other books; I had already read Devon/Chloe's story. I truly enjoyed Deshawn and Anika's story as well. They were HOT!! Deshawn was relentless in his pursuit of Anika. Enjoyed the fact that Anika and Chloe were friends and Devon and Deshawn were twins. Ms Bryant has become one of my favorite authors and therefore whatever she puts out I plan to buy.
2,A Dying Music,"This is undoubtedly Mike Brecker's strongest album ... and it's pretty bad. Sure, it has its moments. But throughout the album his feeble tone, annoying inflections, and clichéd delivery bring things down. A low point is ""Original Rays."" While his use of the EWI is technically impressive, the song itself is one of the most irritating I've ever heard in a jazz context. Of the sidemen, all are okay except Pat Metheny, who is criminally underused. A fine example of what might have been is the haunting Don Grolnick ballad ""The Cost of Living,"" here given what is thought of as its definitive reading. To gain an idea of just how uneffective a song it is, listen to Grolnick's own arrangement (which was a bass clarinet feature for the brilliant Marty Ehrlich, a player who could run circles around Mike Brecker while in a coma). Overall, this is an album that has done as much harm through its significant influence as it's done good."
3,"Interesting, but not her best effort.","I'm a great fan of St. Germain and am delightedly reading my way thru his history. However, this book set in the years prior to the outbreak of World War I and the Russian Revolution, took several weeks and sittings to read. The Count, as always, is a fascinating, enigmatic, lonely and compelling figure, but the convoluted political intrigue, back-stabbings (literally and figuratively) and arms control machinations slowed down the plot. For a dedicated St. Germain fan, however, the book was an interesting addition because it is set just a few years prior to the much better ""Tempting Fate."" Several of the peripheral characters and subjects (Russian revolution, the effect of war on children, political changes in Europe) are introduced in ""Writ in Blood"" and continued in the later book. All in all interesting, but slow."
3,Too political,"If you're into the politics of Europe before World War I, you would probably like this book. I did learn that Serbia had a large influence in the start of the war from this book, but I thought too much of the book was devoted to politics. I think it highly unlikely that a vampire would involve itself in a high profile position. I would suggest reading this book to Saint Germain fans, but to would be fans, I would suggest reading the books about Saint Germain in the order they were published. I thought the book was not as good as the others, but if you are a fan, you will enjoy it anyway. I did like the way the book Dracula was woven into the story. That was a nice touch. I give this book three stars, but four stars to fans of Ms. Yarbro."
3,Not her best effort,"I am a real Saint-Germain junkie, but this book was rather a let-down. Usually Ms. Yarbro's books are exceptionally well-researched, but this one fell flat. I thought the repeated use of certain Saint-Germain sayings (such as ""my...life"" and ""I give you my Word on it"" was a little cheesy and distracting.) The most interesting part of the book for me was the poliyical intrigue surrounding the sale of arms, and I wish it had been better developed.I miss the very detailed background nature that were in books like ""Tempting Fate"" and ""Blood Games.""All in all, an interesting book, and worth reading, but not an exceptional book."
2,a big bloody yawn,"This is without a doubt the dullest vampire novel I've ever read, and Saint-Germain is the kind of wimpy dream-lover fantasy figure who takes all the mystery and danger out of the vampire mythos. The historical research is impressive, but the hero's vampiric identity has almost no impact on the story. The arc of the plot promises to incorporate the outbreak of WWI, but takes place (and is primarily concerned with) only during the arms race that leads up to it. Finally, with Saint-Germain as a pal of Czar Nicholas, one of the most interesting conflicts imaginable--between an immortal vampire and Rasputin--is completely ignored in favor of our boy Saint-Germain guiding another misunderstood female to ""fulfillment."" By the end this book feels more like a REALLLLY long bodice-ripping historical romance, than anything scary like ""Dracula."""
1,always,"This book was too long and the auther was too verbose. I really lost interest by the last half of the book and had to force myself to finish.I do think the auther shows a great deal of knowledge about martial arts and self defense, I think it would be good for women to pay attention to this information in the book but overall this book was a snooze fest."
1,Truly pathetic soap opera,"This is the FIRST hardcover book I have ever thrown away. I collect books, including the paperback ""Interview with a Vampire"" if found in 1977, in Junior high. ""Always"" was a nauseating soap opera that included the classic Uhaul lesbian date where ""true love"" happens at first sight or first sex. This is supposed to be crime fiction, not this twisted and sick personal issues of the ""oh so studly' lead character who apparently falls in love through some mystical chemistry but in other books seems to sweep the amazingly sexy ""one night stands"" off their feet. This was the last ""Aud"" book that I will waste money on. I don't read crime novels for this kind of pedestrian lesbos drama."
4,A good western and acceptable quality print,"Both are good, typical Roy Rogers westerns. Andy Devine is always fun. The Sons of the Pioneers sound terrific and there's plenty of action. The TruColor print is very good...not excellent, but for the money, it's fun entertainment."
3,"Airfoils - LOTS of 'em, graphically displayed","This book is written for people who are comfortable reading and interpreting graphically presented information. It consists of 161 pages of airfoils, with 4 airfoils/page in most cases. For each airfoil, the L/D ratio is plotted against Angle of Attack, and Lift (or Drag) Coefficient.Also shown in the graph for each airfoil is it's cross-section, with Percent of Chord dimensions listed for each station. Testing Results for each airfoil are listed (Vel. in ft/sec), along with date and conditions of test. Descriptive text is limited to a two-page ""Foreword""."
3,The book is mainly an obsolete airfoils database,"I was disappointed by the book because most of the listed airfoils are very old and, in short, obsolete, although the book is still useful for getting data of some NACA airfoils missing in ""Theory of wing sections"" by Abbott, which ranks much better and useful in comparison."
1,Would have been a valuable reference 25 years ago,This book contains sectional drawings and polar plots for over 600 airfoils. But that is all it contains. There are no analyses or recommendations. All of this information is now freely available on the internet along with CAD files for modeling. This book added nothing to my knowledge of airfoils or wing design
4,"Good Perch, like to see it come with a stick on window something.",This mini-perch is great for Conure size. Helps with nail sharpness a bit and easy to clean. The Birds took to it like a duck to water.
3,Made of foam with a sand coating,"So far, my african grey has not chewed this, which is a miracle. But if she does, she will just rip it apart, as it is made of foam. But these are extremely handy for making a little perching area just about anywhere on the cage. Mine came in light green."
5,yepp,"Got a JW Pet Company straight sand perch for my parakeet since it worked so well for him, so I got this one for my cockatiel. She was scared of it at first but that's just because she's scared of anything new, but she got over it after a couple days and now she loves to jump like godzilla from her higher perch to this one so I would say it's a success. I also no longer look like I've been attacked by a cat just from handling her, so it's good for me and her."
3,Havahart,"The original product as shipped by a merchant arrived defective with the spring mechanism mounted backwards. After calling the manufacturer and submitting a photo of the defect, the trap was replaced promptly and without further issues. While I heard that this trap works well, two weeks into the process, the critters (most likely squirrels) are still running around in the attic and avoid the trap (and Victor rat traps as well)."
1,It works okay...,"I caught a squirrel within a week owning this trap. It's pretty sturdy and keeps the animal safe. I'm glad I got this model. However there were times I caught something and they managed to escape just by the animal ramming it's head on the door. The doors were completely shut and tiggers were both down. Some design issues, the animal bounced the trigger upward.EDIT UPDATE:The trap seems to be too small for most Squirrels in my area. The door keeps hitting it's tail and won't close. I have to get a new trap."
1,Do not recomment.,"This trap did not work for us. We can hear a squirrel in a very large attic and are worried that it might be chewing through wires (again.) The trap appears to be a simple enough concept, but the rods that trip the doors are almost impossible to set. We finally read in the instructions to bend one of the rods if the rods didn't fit right. The pamphlet instructs that it can be loaded and set by one person. I deny that. We used peanuts for bait and they kept falling off the bait tray and since the thing is wire they fall under the trap so the basket has to be picked up and the process starts all over again. Seems they have taken a very simple contraption and made it unecessarily complicated. Do not recommend."
4,18 Rabbits so far,Did exactly as expected. No apparent damage to rabbits that are caught. I relocate them and release them (which probably does the most damage to the bunnies).
4,Catches squirrels and opossums,I'm at 25 and counting when it comes to catching squirrels and opossums. I generally relocate them about 5 miles away to the river banks in the country under old oaks. Peanut butter seems to work just great as bait. A few shake the cage so HARD THEY CAN ESCAPE but later they come back and get caught.
4,Not a large rabbit catcher,"I bought this cage with the intend to catch a couple of large rabbits that are enjoying my hosta plants in my garden more than than I am. The trap is well build and trips easily. My problem is that with the trip located in the center of the trap, the rabbits are tripping the door shut with part of their fanny in the way, allowing them to back out before the door is locked into the down position. I have caught smaller species such as chipmunks, squirrels, and a rat. Works well for them. I would recommend a larger cage that has more depth to it to catch the longer rabbit."
4,Good trap,Good trap overall. I used it to capture a particularly smart rat that was driving me nuts. I had to place a large heavy bait( about 1 pound bag of trail mix) on the trigger so that the rat wouldn't notice that he was moving it. This rat was large but he could almost fit through the wire mesh so I would add some hardware cloth to it before using it again.About 2 am I heard the trap close and I had my unwelcome visitor inside.
4,did catch small critters,"This cage was a little small, but it did catch a baby opposum and 2 baby kittens.You do have to stake it to the ground or they will fight & move it.Let the critter settle down before moving the cage as they are not happy to be trapped. We quit baiting so who knows what else we would have caught. Glad to have it handy.Good Luck"
2,Havahart rabbit trap,"The trap is well constructed, but in three weeks use it has not worked. I've used the recommended bait (refreshing it every evening) and placed the trap in areas the rabbit visits, but no success in trapping the rabbit."
1,Peter is laughing,"Takes too much pressure to trigger the system. The rabbits check in, eat, and check out."
2,nothing caught so far,"It looks good, but it had not caught me anything for two weeks. I don't know whether I should return it, or just wait for a little longer."
2,Rabbit trap,"It's been a couple of weeks and I haven't caught any rabbits. I know they are out there, but they don't want to eat any of the delicious bait that I've been putting in the trap."
3,small animal trap,Trap work ok for a short period of time then seemed to have problems with being reset due to quality of metal that bent easily and was difficult to put back in place. Had another trap just like this one that lasted many years and caught many small animals (squirrels).
2,The trap door needs to be more sturdy when closed.,I captured a squirrel but it escaped by pushing against the door. The door is not sturdy enough for it to keep locked in.
3,Not a great fan...,"Don't get me wrong, the price point of this trap is great, but it's performance could be better. In particular, I am not a fan of the door lever wires being exposed, as curious squirrels will frequently trip the trap while still figuring out how to get inside. Mice can easily get in an out of the large mesh, so you'll need to replenish and reset the trap quite frequently.As for trapping rabbits, I have had no luck whatsoever, but I suppose it has to do with having a garden with lots of stuff to munch on and not having sprayed the trap with apple cider as recommended by some to attract rabbits. Overall, I am going to keep on looking for a better trap."
4,worked the first time,Got a squirrel on the first day. They are making me write more than I want to so I will write random words for a few. Have a nice day.
3,havahart,"trap is not near sensitive enough, squirrels go in and eat and leave. Only the bigger ones set off the trap, It is easy to set and use otherwise."
4,"Good for Rabbits & Squirrels, but nor Chipmunks","Bought this trap after having a lot of trouble with rabbits, squirrels and chipmunks. Trap is great for the larger animals, but the trap's construction will not contain chipmunks (they go right out through the large holes in the side/bottom screens). They have a smaller trap for them, but from past use of these traps, the screen was smaller on older traps, so that the trap worked for chipmunks too. Guess they wanted to sell more traps, so now you need the larger and the smaller trap. Will be retrofitting the one I purchased so it will also work for chipmunks."
3,A couple of decent songs but only average overall,"The lead singer on such classic Kool & The Gang hits such as ""Joanna"" and ""Fresh,"" James ""J.T."" Taylor made a few solo albums including this one from 1991. It spawned the minor hit ""Long Hot Summer Night,"" and the ballad ""That's My Girl"" is pretty nice. Though hardly a disaster, the reviewer who said that this was better than Taylor's Kool & The Gang music really needs to clean his or her ears."
3,Slow but involving.,"If anyone remembers the movie ""Scanners"" you can get into the story of Psi/Net. The story is kind of slow moving but I was always wondering how the story would turn out. No major action happens until near the end of the book. This reads more like a PG rated movie. Jedi mind tricks Mr. Williams? I'll buy the sequel to Psi/Net."
2,Ya Never Know,"I didn't think the cd was that great but a few days after I bought it I was watching Conan O'Brien and heard something funny. Ben Affleck mentioned in the interview that he was living with Kevin Smith while they were making the movie Chasing Amy. He said Kevin was dating one of the actresses from the movie and that _this_ was the music Kevin would listen to when he was getting ""friendly"" with her.Now whenever I hear this soundtrack I can't get the picture of ""Silent Bob"" doing the deed out of my head...and hopefully now neither can you. :P"
3,how rediculous!,"I found this at the library and laughed my arse off!talk about a good dose of silly nostagia!it's worth the price only if you remember how goofy the show was-in particular mr bruce willis!god,that guy's full of himself in a very flambouyant way!all in all,it's $7 for a damb good laugh."
4,More tracks would make it a better collection,"I still own the original vinyl lp of this soundtrack, I bought it in 1989 and still enjoy listening to it whenever i feel like relaxing to some good music. It features several highlights such as a rare Bruce track his fans cant find anywhere else and two lovely ones from Cybill. Its a pity, however, the compilers didn't include more songs from the show. I remember I made myself my own Moonlighting special edition on tape,all those years ago. I added some missing tracks I already owned somewhere (Nasty, West End Girls, Man on M.Street, All The Way) which did feature on a few crucial episodes but had been taken off the final compilation and I used to listen to it on my walkman whilst on holiday. Lets hope they release a fleshier remastered edition of this album, in the meantime buy this just the way it is. You won't get disappointed!"
3,Good.....but could have been so much better!,"Although this has the songs most will look for: Al Jarreau's great theme song, Cybill Shepherd's big band numbers, Bruce Willis' great cover of ""Good Lovin'"", ""This Old Heart of Mine"" by the Isley Brothers, etc; it's what's missing that makes this soundtrack incomplete. The following should have been on, and anyone who can download an mp3 can get creative, and complete this set for their library:Tighten Up: Archie Bell & the DrellsRespect: Aretha FranklinI Was Made To Love Her: Stevie WonderLa Bamba: Richie ValensChain Gang: Sam CookePsychedelic Shack: The TemptationsDevil With a Blue Dress: Mitch Ryder & the Detroit WheelsBe My Baby: The RonettesIf You Really Love Me: Stevie WonderBig Man On Mulberry Street: Billy JoelJust My Imagination: The TemptationsIs This What I Get For Loving You: The RonettesMaybe they couldn't get all the rights to the above to include them all, but what was released just left fans of the show wanting more."
5,Lots of power.. over priced,Its a strong powerful blow dryer...what do you expect a blow dryer to do.. dries hair quickly and does not cause knots
2,Burned out within a year,"First, I normally do not write reviews but thought I should inform people. I loved this hair dryer until last week. I have had it for about 9 months. It overheated and threw a spark. Now the low functionality does not work and overheats within 5 minutes. I am looking into returning to the manufacturer."
1,Does not have 8 speeds,"This item, Tourmaline 1043, does not have the speed and heat settings advertised on the box! We purchased it for the advertised 8 speed and heat settings. It has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings. Low heat is no heat. Medium is too high for low heat needs, like for fine hair. This is misleading advertising by the manufacturer."
5,Best hair dryer,This is actually my second hair dryer of the same company I had the first one for about 5 yrs which is honestly long seeing a how I use it every day and I had also shared it with my sister who used it everyday it was light easy to handle and I love the nozzle on the end to spacifically direct the air to my hair when I use my brush honestly love this hair dryer couldn't live without it or my Paul Mitchell straightener... May be a tad expensive but it last longer then cheap ones...
2,Not Built to Last,"I bought this about 9 months ago on the extreme recommendation of a salon and after reading so many reviews here at Amazon. It seemed to take forever to arrive, but I patiently waited becuase I was really looking forward to a high-quality hair dryer! At first, it was great...powerful with just enough heat to dry my hair quickly but not burn it. Within months I noticed the blower had lost some power and it was putting out too much heat and not enough air. I cleaned the filter and got a little of the power back, but now it's pretty much toast. It's very hot and the watts are probably half of what it was when I bought it less than a year ago. The filter is not dirty. I've had this problem with many blow dryers over the years (other ""cheaper"" ones). We can send someone to the moon, but we can't make a blow dryer that lasts! Don't waste your money, this dryer will disappoint you in a matter of months."
1,Lasted only 3 months before starting to spark inside and having intermittant fluctuations of fan speeds,"Note - my hair isn't particularly long or think so I only need to use a dryer for perhaps 7-8 minutes each morning on LOW to get the job done. I have a dedicated 20 amp GFI outlet for my dryer, directly off the 200 amp main panel and so it's got plenty of nice clean power.After only 3 months of light use (and 10 days of this I was out of the country using a different hair dryer), the unit started having fan speed issues and sparking inside.Granted, dryers don't last so long in general but 3 MONTHS? Never again - this time round we're trying the Conair Ionic to see if it's as good as the reviews."
3,Not as good as I expected.,"I just received this hairdryer last week. My hair has been coming out frizzy lately so when my old hairdryer died I decided to spend a little more for a higher quality one. This hairdryer definitely helps with the frizz factor, however I am disappointed in the amount of time it takes to dry my hair. I'm not sure what that other reviewer is talking about. I think it actually takes longer than the last hairdryer I had. Also, there are two sets of buttons on the handles (they are more like toggles). There's not much room for your thumb on the handle and the buttons are frequently hit while I'm blowdrying. I don't hate it, but for what I paid, I don't love it either."
3,"Worked good, not heavy, but bad attachments!!!","I have had this dryer for over a year now. In fact I liked it so much after trying it, I bought a second one for my daughter (since she was always stealing mine).THE PLUSES: It is more lightweight than other dryers we've had, it dries hair fairly fast, leaves it shiny, and less frizzy than our old dryer. The variety of speed/heat settings is nice too, since a lot of dryers have fewer settings. Our local salon also uses these dryers, although they sometimes complain about the downside to this dryer, which we have also experienced.THE DOWNSIDE: The comb attachment. It NEVER stays on!!! Both of our Tourmaline Tools Lite dryers have comb attachments with broken teeth due to it constantly flying off. It is very frustrating! Other than that, we really liked this dryer.NOTE: One dryer started making loud fan noises after a year, and we had to get rid of it. We replaced it with an Andis (see my review on that one) -- I liked this one better than that one!"
1,Stopped working......,I have purchased 2 of these hairdryers in the last 3 years. The hairdryer is great while it works. Both dryers stopped working after about 18 months or so. I clean the lint collector regularly. I have short hair and so they don't get a huge workout each day. Of course they stop functioning when they are out of the warranty period. I will contact the manufacturer before considering a third purchase.
3,A Classic,I felt really silly ordering a 10 year old computer book. But this one really is a classic and rereading it was worth the cost of admission. It is amazing how many of the lessons we have forgotten.
1,You must be kidding,"Yes, at first read, this book seems very helpful. Seems like I can identify, etc. However, I'm sorry but I have trouble getting software development answers/advice from a team that cannot deliver product properly. Even if the answers given are the correct ones. That's like saying 2 factorial is equal to 2 by taking 2 and adding it to zero; correct answer, wrong path."
5,"Excellent, the best book I've read so far","As a technical manager in an internet start up I run a team of developers. This book provides an excellent overview on how to structure your team, run the development process, schedule, supervise and lead to a successful conclusion a technical project.I particularly liked the structure. It starts out describing how to approach a project and then touches on important things like motivation and teamwork. Every chapter has 2-3 cases which describe a typical development flaw or a good practice.This book should be a mandatory reading for any developer or a team leader.Highly recommended."
5,Every Technology Manager Should Read this Book,"In a world where most managers think it's their raison d'etre to ""negotiate"" the most ludicrous schedule possible, this book is a godsend. (I actually design ASIC's for a living, but it's easy to draw parallels.)The one nit is that it does not realistically address the fact that good managers who can achieve tight schedules often don't get a chance to do so because they are underbid by incompetents within the organization."
5,A superb MUST read for any software development organisation,"This book must rate as probably the best software practitioners guide written to date. This book will certainly become a prescribed book to study upon joining our software development team.The structure of the book are well considered and the examples provided to highlight the discussion is excellent.The compilation of all the software development ""Best Practices"" as a seperate part in the book towards the end of the book is great. It allows for fast confimation of ideas and priciples."
5,Great for Managers and Developers,"This is an excellent project-centric book for both managers and developers. If you are a manager, it tells you what to do and what not to do. Teaches you not to be bullied by technologically ignorant corporate officers, how developers think and how to make them happy. Most of all, it teaches you how to leverage your projects to get the most bang for your buck. Sites real-world examples as well as the hypothetical. I highly recommend this book for anyone working professionally in the IT/IS industry."
4,Desktop Reference,"The desktop reference that every project team member should have is Steve McConnell's ""Rapid Development"". My reason? This book covers just about everything - from Best Practices (more than 2 dozen) to Team Building, and includes case studies, ""Do's and Don'ts"", nuts and bolts, and topics of interest for any team member. It's a forward-thinking type of reference that literally makes people think about why ""doing things right the first time"" is far less painfull than ""doing it again the right way"". It's about 2-inches thick with nearly 650 pages of eye-opening reading for all."
4,Rapid Development,"Its really a Book that not only IS Managers should read, it takes you to see your errors and then gives you a solution. I do enjoy this book, and will work side by side with it in my next project."
2,out of date,"This will teach me to check a book's publication date before I grab it. The first couple of chapters seemed curiously old-fashioned, so I flipped through the rest of the book. That's when I spotted a Line of Code section that used Basic, Pascal and 'Macro Assembler' as example languages.I could almost wax nostalgic over the idea that rapid development is exemplified by a nine month in-house automation project for sales people. Those were the days - 1996 to be exact.I still have Steve McConnell's 1993 Code Complete, which is a classic. And his 1997 Project Survival Guide, which is still relevant. All I can say about Rapid Development is that it was probably a good anthology of current practice when it was written.This posting is anonymous because McConnell fans will probably flame this review."
2,Restating the obvious,"I bought this book based on the recommendation of a coworker , who had the book recommended to him as well. Sadly I did not see eye to eye with him on this. The book was filled with 500 pages of obvious strategies and pitfalls that people should already know from common sense. Topics like leaving time cushions for error, don't higher people to work with people that dislike each other, etc.... I returned the book after two days (I did get though the whole book). The only partially useful information was in the last section of the book (about 150+ pages), where he went over more concrete theories. I'm hoping that his other great book ""Code Complete"" is a much better ""great book"" then this one."
5,Required reading for anyone in the computer industry,"I wish I had known about this book 3 years ago when I started my first software job. Full of important software engineering concepts, presented in a clear and humorous manner. I got (and read it) a month ago, and it made a major positive impact in getting the crises at work under control. It's full of references to research, books and papers that I now use as ammunition to push for better software engineering standards in my company."
4,A great compilation of known software best/worst practices,"If there's one book you're going to get on software development then this is it. McConnell consolidates the writings, reseach, and teachings of many authors into a single hefty book. A good reference for all of the buzzwords, terms and approaches in software development today.The only issue I have with the work is its breadth which detracts from the focus normally associated with a schedule driven/compressed project. In his attempt to be comprehensive McConnell has covered mutch ground, unfortunately he only scratches the surfice in too many areas. This makes Rapid Development a good compilation of software engineering concepts but without the depth required for people to improve their own ways of building applications."
1,"Cheap crap, barely what I ordered","As with most store-bought costumes, the picture looks much nicer than the actual costume. The material doesn't bunch up all cute like the baby in the picture. I also got a different hood than that shown. The closure was different (not the one in the pic or the one I wanted for my toddler) and the ears were once bigger and someone cut them down with a pair of scissors in a rather dog-eared fashion, exposing the inside white foam. I had to fix the ears as best I could with a black permanent marker."
2,Baby Bat Costume,"Received costume in an unsealed plastic bag with no cardboard insert depicting what bag contained (possibly used). Quality of costume was low, however, I knew this costume would be used once. Wouldn't dare to wash. Ears on bat hat were sewn on crooked and were very floppy. Overall I was disappointed. But my son still looked adorable. I would have returned it if I had time but with 2 little ones you never seem to have that extra minute or the energy. I will purchase costumes in person and not on Amazon in the future."
4,Great costume - for walkers only!,"This is a super cute costume, but my son wasn't walking yet when he wore it and twice he face-planted while crawling because he got caught up in the wings. But if you've got a walker who'll fit into it, it's a great buy!"
2,PRODUCT WITH BAD PRESENTATION,"I am desilucionado with this product since it came to me without box and in the presentation photo if it has it, they invoiced to me with a price and I arrive myself much more with expensive other, and also the bottle of the cream came under the level"
1,I'm still waiting!,"This product is taking to long to arrive. All stuff I bought the same day arrived weeks ago and I'm still waiting for this one. Besides It's not possible to track the product in ""where's my stuff"". It's driving me crazy!!!"
4,Too watery/muy aguada...,"I think this lotion is a bit too liquid and a bit too sweet. I thought it was more 'sexy', like its name, but that wasn't what I felt when I smelled it. I don't hate it but I'm not exactly happy with it. Creo que esta loción es demasiado aguada y dulce, huele a pastelería. No me gusta mucho, no la volvería a comprar."
2,Waste of studio time,"Economy recording to fulfill a contract. These songs lack the power of the originals, but again, this AIN'T Molly Hatchet! I know Ingram own's the name, but that doesn't make him Dave Hlubek. This band has three excellent albums of their own and should stick to their material."
5,rockin cd,"This cd rocks and bobby ingram is keeping the legend of molly hatchet going. I am proud of the work he has done on every album to date. The songs sound so much better than the originals and each track rocks from beginning to end. I highly recommend the cd for the love of southern rock , Molly Hatchet style! LOng live Molly Hatchet!!!!"
4,OK until a restored official release is available,"Yes, this is an Asian Region 5 DVD which won't play on all players, although there are multi-region players out there. Some computer DVD drives can also get around the regional encoding. That said, it's an OK transfer, a little on the choppy side. I don't think anything is really missing except the last two seconds of a scene where Laughton and Zasu Pitts discuss their common fondness for cooking and goldfish. There just seem to be a couple of instances where a scene jumped to the next when it probably should have faded to the next. No big deal. Also, they have removed the nice old Paramount logo from the opening and closing shots. However, since it is affordably priced and it is the only option currently available in digital format, I recommend buying it. Hopefully someone will bring out a nice restored version, but until then, this is still better than VHS or the increasingly rare showings on TV."
1,I was sent a defective disk. Amazon will not accept it back,On first play the disk was defective. It would skip and freeze at multiple locations. I tried it on two different DVD players. I washed the disk in water and dried it with soft cotton -- that did not help either. You are now cautioned that Amazon has shipped defective disks of this DVD.
1,Can't contact the seller,"This product arrived safely, but when I tried to play it, it skipped, jumped and froze so often, I just consider it trash. The outside is packaged nicely but the product sucks! I have no way of contacting this seller and I wasted my money...I will never purchase with you again"
5,Oft Forgotten,"This is a wonderful, American movie. It is often forgotten, but I highly recommend it for youngsters who are studying the American Revolution. It is a story from the perspective of an English butler who is lost in a game of poker to an American cowboy. He sees America as the land of opportunity and juxtaposes it to his upbringing in England. Charles Laughton and Charlie Ruggles are superb."
3,convenient but clunky,"The idea of a water-tight vial for pills which attaches to a keyring is a good one. It is understandable that the container has to be of a certain size to accomodate variously sized pills and their dosages. However this item is rather large and is quite heavy for its size. A smaller and lighter version would be more convenient and comfortable, especially when trying to reduce the amount of baggage in one's trouser pocket."
4,"Great product, very useful and looks shiny.","It definitely serves its purpose while looking cool. My only issue would be that the inside isn't evenly colored and looks dirty. I've washed it multiple times so I know it's fine, it's just a style thing. The cap can be difficult to screw back in place, so if you have difficulty with your hands you probably shouldn't buy this one."
1,Buy something else.,"Buy something else. I was disappointed to receive this keychain and find it is too large and heavy to carry comfortably in my pocket. But that didn't matter because the inside is unfinished and not suitable for carrying medicine, or anything else you would put in you mouth. There are better products out there."
4,small,"I was planning on using this to hold a pair of ear plugs on my key chain. This model is too small. It is built well and would be perfect for holding very small items, but is too small to hold ear plugs."
5,The Myth of the Robber Barons: A New Look at the Rise of Big Business...,Everything I expected and that's all I want to say or need to say. Clicking on the stars is enough.
1,"Say hello to ""The New History""","Newsflash: Vanderbilt, Rockerfeller, et al. were all political entrepreneurs. No surprise that now, when the division of wealth is greater than any time in US history, noises arise from the right claiming the Robber Barrons to be saints and Teddy Roosevelt the antichrist. Let the Revisionism begin!"
1,Revisionist history at its best!,"I read this book after having read the original based on the two reviews above. I wonder if the 'Young America's Foundation' is a conservative indoctrination center and perhaps part of the radical religious right? I wonder if the two reviewers above are in any way connected to the same. This book avers to report truthful facts, which it does. It simply omits lots of others that are pertinent so as to present precisely the picture it wishes to see. Read the original ""Robber Barons"" for the full story."
2,Too one-sided.,"For the most part, I enjoyed reading the book. The charitable contributions of these men should be documented, and they were. Their contributions to society have been many, such as Vanderbilt University. However, Folsom overlooks Rockefeller's conduct in the ""Ludlow Massacre"" and JP Morgan's selling defective arms to the North during the Civil War. These incidents were ignored, which is why I gave this book the rating I did."
5,Great Book for Introducing the Expansion of Industry,"I used this book as the primary text for a high school class I taught: Monopolies: Necessity, Invention, and the Corporation. It is a great springboard to learning how the major indutries of the 19th century developed and helped shape this country.Folsom presents the major players with a conversational tone that makes this book accessible to young readers. He does a great job of presenting the people in a realistic light, rather than the classic ""Captains of Industry,"" out to rob the little guy view presented in so many texts in this genre.Thoroughly enjoyable and recommended. My only prooblem with it - why is it so hard to get? I have had a horrible time getting copies of this book - the publisher may be phasing it out, although I don't know. I've tried several outlets, and all seem to have difficulty getting multiple copies. Amazon claims 1-2 day availability - it's been a month and I am STILL waiting for copies."
5,Great book,Thhis book is great for those who are intrested in history or that have family that was living in that area during the Slilvermining days as I did. My Great Cousin was mentioned in this book and his picture was with the train engine used in Silverton and Durango.
4,Sturdy attractive unit,"Overall good product. The assembly is fairly easy but will take a couple of hours. The one difficult part is connecting the gas line nozzle tip to the heating element portion (the ""engine""). It does not want to click easily. You will need a strong person and a helper. Use a little 3-in-1 oil to make the job easier, twist gently, and don't give up. After that it works fine.I have had other patio heaters at this price point and this is one of the better ones."
2,I am looking for a new heater...,"The Good:I love the natuaral gas option - no worries about running out of gas!Heavy base mitigates wind-storm tip oversWhen it works, it really puts out the heat!The Bad:Assembly is non-trivialThe unit is somewhat unsturdy (wobly) once completedHard to tell when the pilot light is lit - unless it's dark outThe Ugly:I have had this heater for three years now and every year I have to replace the ignition and valve module. This is a big ""heart transplant"" kind of operation. The first two were free, but now they want me to pay... I will be finding a new heater."
4,"Good Product, Tough Assembly","Title should say it all. It took me four frustrating hours to assemble it, but it does work well now that it's whole."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I find myself wishing I had ordered one of the Nia DVDs before this book. Trying to learn exercises from a book only is difficult, and after seeing videos of classes online, I have no idea how to put the exercises together to make it a high energy workout it's supposed to be. I am also somewhat annoyed by the authors' negativity toward other exercises. It seems like any other exercise besides Nia isn't good enough, they emphasize that other exercise causes pain and injury, and is repetitive. Although obviously some traditional exercise is this way, there are plenty of exercises that people do because they like them and they do feel good, they're not repetitive and don't cause injury. I was so excited about getting this book but this attitude that Nia is the end all of exercise and perfect in every way is a turn off, and I'm not sure I want to pursue Nia further."
4,NIA in words,"I've had the pleasure of attending Nia classes at my health club, and at a local spa, but have had difficulty following the routines. This book breaks down the individual movements, making it easy for me to understand and remember them. I'm eager to take this new knowledge into the Nia classroom, and relax in the knowing. If you haven't tried Nia, and have the opportunity to attend a class, by all means -- don't hesitate!"
3,Great Exercise,I love this book. This is the best exercise program I have tried. It works all the joints and muscles in the body and does it with music. It encourages you to work at your own pace.
1,pure garbage.,"This was one of the wackest cd's I've ever heard. Man, when I was in 5th grade, I loved hearing Helluva, the beat was great, especially sampled that oldies song mentioned previous, and they were talking about some chick they were obsessed about. But then the rest of the cd, weak weak lyrics, wack @$$ beats. I was like, this is MC Hammer level. I was so dissapointed, do not own this cd, because after one listen through every song, I was so disgusted. Save your money. This is a classic example of weak hip hop."
1,lame album,"this shiznick was wack. 'Helluva' used a sample from an old Betty Wright song for the beat, which was mad doo doo. why the heck they formed in the damn first place."
3,"Nice vignettes, but incomplete coverage","I bought this because I liked the introduction, which was very evocative, in typical Lucado style. You should be aware, however, that if you are looking for a study of the WHOLE book of John, this is not that book! For example, it completely skips John chapter 3; you know, the one with the strangely familiar verse seen at sports events everywhere.We'll probably use it mostly for the vignettes; In fact, I read the introduction aloud at our first meeting. But we'll use something else to walk us through the book."
5,Understanding,Used this in our Bible Study group and everyone loved it. The questions gave us a better understanding of John.
4,Life Lessons: Book of John,Excellent study help. Questions presented at the end of each section help you think about and comprehend the deeper meaning of the message.
2,JACCI MCGHEE IS A GIFTED R&B VOCALIST,"It was Jacci's phrasing that brought the duet MAKE IT LAST FOREVER alive. This is apparent in Mariah Carey's remake too ( who I love but must admit steals a lot from other artist's style. i.e. Mariah's My All sounds like ""UnBreak My Heart"" by Toni Braxton; Mariah's ""Anytime You Need A Friend"" sounds like ""Always"" by Atlantic Starr; Mariah's ""Make It Happens"" was a total rip off of Alicia Meyer's 1981 R&B hit single ""I Want To Thank You"" even with references to thanking God/Heavenly Father)! It's not Jacci's passionate singing it's just the songwriting."
4,Very Underated,"The year was 1992 and the song that really grabbed my attention was a single named ""It Hurt Me"" by Jacci McGhee. I have never been one to purchase a CD for one song, but I went right out and bought this one. What really drove it home for me was the video she was in with Keith Sweat. The song demonstrates the pain she was feeling and I felt it. Jacci McGhee is so underated as a singer and song writer, I have listened to the other cuts on the CD and there are some really good music."
3,Training horses,"This Frank Bell DVD is fine for early beginners, but if you've worked with horses for very long you may want to find another DVD. Bell does a good job with the common problems but it's really basic stuff."
1,No support for 64 bit OS,"No support for 64 bit OS, couldn't install it because I couldn't get by the requirements fro visual c++ 8.0 lack of support. No support for Windows 7 either. Wasted my money."
1,Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 Essentials,I could not get this to even work and to me it was not at all good.
2,Check the song titles carefully before you buy,"I thought that this would have ALL of the songs from the movie. It doesn't. It does have WAY too much instrumental on it. It really was a disappointment to me, but it's my own fault that I bought it based on the movie and NOT on the songs listed. Buy with caution."
3,Make sure you understand what your getting before you buy,The selections on this soundtrack are pretty good but I couldn't help feeling disappointed with it because it lacked the biggest hit song which was the centerpiece of the movie: Walking on Sunshine by Katrina and the Waves. Unfortunately I didn't check the song list carefully enough before I bought. Don't repeat my mistake.
1,Not informative enough,"I ordered this book to try to understand this controversy and I am anti death penalty also. First, unless you are a civil rights law professor, this book was not an interesting read.I gathered these men were completely guilty, hard to sympathize with them from how this book is written.Might have helped if the accuser families, victim's family, towns people or politicians were interviewed for this book. There is much mystery around the victim Mrs. Floyd. I can understand not wanting to be the poster girl for rape especially in the 1950's but a more sympathetic look at her life would have enriched the book from a literary standpoint."
3,Martinsville Seven: The untold story,"The true story of the Martinsville Seven will soon be told and hopefully, it will become a Hollywood movie. The real victims were the Seven. Peace."
1,Terrible,This book is all over the place and is hard to follow. The author mixes various subjects with no obvious focus and throws code listings at you that you don't know where to place.Probably the worst programming book I own.
1,Frustration,"I saw the Thomson logo at the top left on the front cover and thought it was textbook quality. I was dead wrong!! As the engineer said, the directions are incoherent and you don't even know when he has given instructions or just an example. I had to search the web for help answers just to do the ""Hello World"" application. There is no troubleshooting guide in case you get stuck. If you get stuck you better clear up your schedule cause you will be searching for answers for a while. Why not spend that time and buy a good book on programming. I would expect more from a programmer than this garbled mess of words."
3,Fairly good,"Overall, the book is fairly useful. However, it lacks several things:1. Contains many snippets of code that cannot be determined where they go2. Constantly uses forward-slashes (/) instead of backslashes (\) for filenames (even if outside of code).3. Does not justify certain variable names; ie a local variable one would normally call ""fontSize"", he calls ""m_pFontSize"".4. What exactly is something such as a ""PNFGLGETQUERYOBJECTIVEARBPROC""? He uses types like this alot, but never says what they are (even in the introduction to OpenGL)."
4,A graded learning approach,"Erik Yuzwa's GAME PROGRAMMING IN C++: START TO FINISH will lend particularly well to prior C++ programmers and users who want to learn game programming. Chapters use current game programming information and take a lesson plan graded learning approach to building an entire course in C++ game programming, from the basics to creating a complete game."
4,an excellent pictorial account...,"this is a wonderful collection of images, but so many of them are presented poorly. they're extremely grainy and tinted hideous sepia tones. chalk it up to the 80's, i guess.despite this problem, the album is definitely worth adding to your collection if you are a serious Romanov fan. General royalty buffs who want just one Romanov photo book would do better with Prince Michael's _Nicholas & Alexandra: The Family Albums_ (a book that everyone interested in royalty and/or the Romanovs should have, imo)."
5,I love this book,So many pictures of the Tsar and his family many made by the Tsar and his family. Very intersting book and a great addition to my collection of Romonoff Books.
1,Advertised wrong,"The description says that the lens is ""Clear"", but when it arrives, the lens is tinted dark.I returned the item and have still yet to hear if I'm going to be reimbursed.I'm really not happy with the purchase or how the return is being handled."
4,Decent for the price,"The plastic in the frame & cover is a little thin, but good for the price. The 'chrome' seems to be the color of the plastic itself, so it wont wear off. Should be good for years of routine service."
2,Metal? LOL,"The description of this item says ""Each metal frame is carefully hand polished."" That is simply not true. This frame is flimsy plastic, no metal ore was harmed in the making of this frame. That does not make it a terrible product, but I was shocked at how lightweight and cheap it felt."
5,Protection and Classy,Cruiser bubble shield with the chrome frame protects your license plate and makes an ordinary thing look classy. Priced right.
2,"Like Bubble, Hate Plastic Frame","I bought this in person at an auto vendor. I wanted a cover for my ""My Other Car is a TARDIS"" vanity plate ASAP. I had my doubts about the ""polycarbonate"" (AKA plastic) frame. But, in it's shrink-wrapped plastic, it looked okay. I installed it easily enough, except having to make a call to the manufacturer to figure out how to use the plastic inserts for the ""chrome"" (again, chrome-colored platic) screw covers. It went on well, if you have the patience to use the special ""security"" Allen wrench. But, it looks very cheap--not something that highlights the plate, let alone the car. Every time I look at it, I cringe. I would have gotten the bubble with a separate real metal frame that would have looked better. However, the metal on every one of them, in their package, was rusted!"
3,Nice product for the price,"I like the look of the frame and cover, but this item really didn't work well with my vehicle application. This frame and cover has 4 screw points to anchor to the vehicle and my vehicle has only 2 screw points on the top so the bottom of the frame and cover don't sit flush. If you vehicle has 4 screw mounting points this product will work well."
4,A great wedding present!,"This book makes for a great wedding present, especially for any teachers you know who are getting married. While parts are a tad cliche, others are unexpectedly poignant, and most of the book is refreshingly funny. One of the best things about this book is the illustrations, which were done by the children to accompany their advice."
4,cute gift book,"I needed a ""light"" gift for the groom at the bridal shower and this was perfect. Small but cute."
4,Great printer - Terrible software!,"I recently bought a Kodak Digital camera (DC3400 Zoom)to use with my Epson 870 Photo printer and the results are really great. My wife said, ""the details in these photo's are better than the ones we get from our 35mm!"" Two things that I've determined are - 1. Use Epson Photo Quality Glossy Paper 2. Use a good software pgm. I downloaded Ulead Photo Explorer 6.0 for free; it is really good. The software that came with the printer, makes my system shut down. Even the software that came with my camera isn't good. Kodak and Epson need to get a clue when it comes to software, otherwise, they're GREAT!"
2,An intermittent performer,"I've been using this printer for six months on a Windows 2000 system. Photo print quality can be good but it is not consistent. Sometimes I get decent prints, other times the prints have lines on them or ink spots on the borders. This can happen from one print to another on the same run. Paper handling with roll paper is a problem. The roll paper is a nice concept but often the printer won't load the roll properly and sometimes ejects too much paper before printing the first image. The driver software needs improvement. The constant pop up messages while printing are an annoyance. They give you too much information and get in the way when you just want to print in the background while doing other work. Epson still has a lot to learn from HP in this regard. Since new printers come out almost weekly I'd take a look around before jumping on this one."
5,Good job Epson,"I bought this printer in Canada...it came with a French setup CD, but no installation instructions in the box. After getting the install poster, it setup well and I'm amazed by the quality of my photos. I take digital photos with a Sony DSC-S70 set to 1600x1200 resolution (2.1MP) and 4x6 prints are awesome. I've yet to experiment with larger prints, but I'm thinking about keeping my old Canon BJC-4000 for draft printing from the web, Word etc as ink seems to go quickly...Good job Epson."
2,"Landscapes YES, people NO","While the Stylus Photo 870 renders excellent prints of objects and landscapes, skintones always have a marked violet cast. None of the numerous adjustments provided in the driver software seem to impact this shortcoming. I used Epson photo paper, and found no difference relative to other Premium photo papers. This same paper yields perfect colors with an HP895 inkjet printer, using the identical file, software, and computer.If your images do not include people, you will be happy with the Photo 870. Otherwise, you will be extremely dissapointed."
2,kind of flimsy compared to the pan,I bought this from Amazon along with a 12 inch non-stick frying pan:http://www.amazon.com/Nordic-Ware-Restaurant-Cookware-Skillet/dp/B0001V4DD8/ref=pd_bxgy_k_text_bThe pan is great but the lid is kind of flimsy by comparison. It did not fit well when it arrived but I realized it was slightly bent and was able to bend it with my hands and now it fits perfectly. It was not worth the hassle of returning for another one since it was so easy to unbend but that just indicates the thin metal.
2,Nordic Ware Restaurant12 inch Brushed Stainless-Steel Lid,"I had to return it, It said 12 inch on the sleeve but only measured 10 inch. I ordered a different kind."
5,"Perfect lid for T-fal Pro 12.5""","This lid fits beautifully for the T-fal Pro 12.5"" non-stick frying pan (top rated by Cooks Illustrated). Great purchase and well worth it, especially given how light it is to handle."
4,"Well-Made, Not Quite the Right Size","Nordic Ware has always offered good, well-made products at reasonable prices, and this lid was no exception. However, I have 3 different 12"" skillets, and it was either a little too big or too small for all three of them. For two of the skillets, I can use it, but it doesn't give me the ""fit"" I need to keep moisture from escaping, so I have to watch what I'm cooking more closely. Not a huge problem, but I wish it was sized perfectly. Maybe it would fit better if any of my skillets were also Nordic Ware brand?"
3,Adequate,"This lid was a replacement for a heavy glass lid I hated. I like its light weight. I would rather have a smooth, shiny surface because the stainless surface is harder to clean and shows finger marks. It was too big for a 12-inch Wearever saute pan, but a universal lid I bought at Target was too small. I used weatherstripping on its edge to make a seal and so far, it works. For the money, I'm satisfied -- sure beats buying a new pan!"
4,Good Product,Container is air tight. My wife likes it. Only complaint is it is not microwave safe. Though it is clear from the product specification we did not realize it.
4,Steve Pushes Forward,"In a determined move to take control of the character of his sound, Steve Earle rides the faders into the red zone, mixing brittle country steel with a revved up guitar licks and forces his way past corporate country experts to begin the definition of a genre. Subtley blending his vocal twang and storytime lyrics with hot guitars and RnR attitude, he opens the bar room door and sucks you in. Just about the time you think that Music Row has a place for him, he sneaks in a harmonica ala Dylan and introduces you to an Angry Young Man, a TexMex San Antonio harlot complete with cheezy Sam the Sham Farfisa Organ, and the declaration of his intention to take life on his OWN terms.. I Aint Ever Satisfied. It proved to be quite prophetic. A clinic in writing and recording for the sake of the song. Townes would be proud."
4,must buy,"Growing up listening to this album, and knowing every word on it, despite my lack of understanding, I, like my father, were heartbroken when we wore out this tape. Unable to find a copy in any music store, I thought it was lost forever. Listening to these songs again brings back nostalgia of when the music of steve earle was actually good."
2,unsatisfying collection of anecdotes,"The tales here span decades. Read what it was like when the Web was unknown, and BBSs and Algol were cutting edge technology. The hackers seems to hail mostly from Britain.But the book is quite frustrating. The anecdotes, and that is all they are, whet the appetite for more details. Just when an exploit starts to pique your interest, it ends."
3,A classic for every young child's library!,"The book's cover was more worn than I expected, but the rest of the book was as advertised - in good condition for a well-loved often-read children's book. Delivery was as prompt as promised."
3,Great writer but not his best book.,"Having read ""Palace of Dreams"" and ""Broken April"", both of which I found excellent, I bought this one. Ismail Kadare is a great writer and you can see it even in this book, but on the whole I found it inferior to the other two. It lacks their depth and looks more improvised."
1,"Typical claims, atypical results","The 5 star rating must have been written by someone who ""peddles"" the stuff. I'm in agreement with Lynda from Florida, this stuff does no good. I followed all their directions and very little weight loss (more to do with my eating less and exercising more), certainly didn't measure up to their claims. Don't waste your money on this product, you may as well use your money for something else."
4,Good cd,"This is an overall good cd to check out. The best songs are Rump Shaker(the reason I bought the cd), New Jack Swing II, Tell Me How You Feel, Hard, Knock-N-Boots, and Here We Come. This is a good cd for just kickin' it, so check it out today!"
3,One Hit Wonders,"I know many music fans have heard a smash single from an artist that was never heard from again. That artist releases their debut album and never makes their mark again. Wreckx-N-Effect is the perfect example of a one hit wonder. ""Rump Shaker"", the lively single and music video, became Wreckx-N-Effect's first hit and their only hit. Wreckx-N-Effect did make appearances on soundtracks to prolong their careers, but it did not really matter. Later artists like Lou Bega, 702, and Kelis joined that one hit wonder club. Though it all started with Wreckx-N-Effect."
2,Best suited as background music,"Okay, so they're better than Puff Daddy....that doesn't really mean much, since they're barely any better. They have a few nicely produced tracks, reminiscent of the 'new jack swing' era, but just like any party 'rappers' who came before or after them, their lyrics are shallow at best. Chalk them up as the next Young MC's or pre-Puff Daddy's."
4,Very Tasteful Tea,This tea is very tasty without being sweet. It is great either hot or cold. Just don't over steep as it tends to get bitter.
5,Great and very entertaining story!!,I was at Borders book store and overheard someone reading this story to their child. It sounded like a really neat story. A few days later I saw it on Amazon and I decided to order it. I was surprised at how much me and my kids really love it! There are so many poor quality books out there and it was great to find such a fantastic book with beautiful illustrations and a wonderful storyline. I highly recommend it.
4,Very uplifting book for everday use,"This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I find it to be very uplifting and inspiring. There's a different passage for everyday of the year; there's also a different quote every day... This book is very motivating and I look forward to reading it each day. I recommend this book for anyone, not just if you are a co-dependent."
1,Gentle Reminders,I cannot rate it as I have not recieved it yet. Disappointed in how long it is taking as it was supposed to be a christmas present.
4,great buy,"I've had this set for a year and a half now and I think they are great, especially for the price. (But I got them on sale for half off!) Absolutely nothing sticks to the nonstick interiors and the surface coating has been very durable, no scratches or chips. My only problem is that the color darkened on the the pieces I have tended to use more often. But this isn't really a big issue since otherwise they have far exceeded my expectations."
1,Won't be nonstick for long,"These pots and pans got scratches the first time I used them! I was really excited and I read all of the information about how to use and care for them. The first time I cooked with them, they got scratches (and the teflon started coming off) even though I used only plastic and wood spoons. I also didn't use abrasive sponges or harsh cleaning chemicals. Beware: these won't be nonstick for long.I returned them for the Farberware Millenium Stainless Steel set and I love them!"
3,good set for price,"I am very pleased with these pots and pans. the only problem is that the outside of them is not nonstick, in fact...i can't get it clean. Love the color and the strain and pour lids! They save so much time and hassle."
5,Cute DVD!,Definitely keeps my 4 year old's attention. Very educational video as awell as entertaining for kids.It gets the child involved and helps them interact .
2,didn't care for this one,My 2 year-old has many elmo DVDs and she likes most of them and watches them over and over. This one however didn't get a 2nd chance. It was long and kinda slow for her...I thought it might be a bit mature for her but it didn't interest me either :-/
2,Do Not Buy,"Do not buy this movie. It is manufactured on demand, which means they're working with a lower quality print. It is a letterbox movie but the film is in 1:33, which is pan and scan. It's unfortunate that this movie has not been release. It is a personal favourite of mine and the scene stealer is a very youthful, Edward Albert,Jr. Sadly, he passed away about a year after his father and his lover in the film, Liv Ullman, has outlasted him. Smoking ended his life prematurely. That's another not for all of you smokers. Give it up now before it kills you. Oh, and wait for a legitimate release of the dvd in letterbox or bluray and then make the purchase."
4,Being a courage alitte early.,I love this movie. It has a few corny moments but it's exactly good. The courage gets her man or should write boy. Very good movie.
1,Not worth Liv-ing for!,"This frothy comedy, based on a Broadway hit, is terribly undermined by the central miscasting of Liv Ullmann as the older woman. Ullmann,better a dramatic actress than a polished comedienne, lacks the glamor for the role, and is a decade too young for it. She is heavy and unconvincing, like a cow portraying a cool feline. This movie, along with the execrable ""Lost Horizon"", buried her mercifully short-lived Hollywood career. A fiasco! Would have been better with someone like Audrey Hepburn or even Liz Taylor."
4,DVD Please!!,"I, too, saw this movie when it came out in the theaters. It has an outstanding cast. I fell in love with Greece and have wanted to go there ever since I saw this movie. Now that I am, ahem, older, I also appreciate the May-December aspect even more than I did when I saw it in my twenties. Not a perfect movie, but a really outstanding romantic comedy. I have been waiting for the DVD for years as have many others it seems. Who has to see this to get it done!?!"
5,DVD!!! Who do we contact?!!!,Truly one of my favorite films... I really wonder why it has not been released in dvd?! Who do we contact to ask why? Is there a list somewhere we can add our name to?! I love this film. It full of wonderful actors. A feel good film! We need more of these! Please bring it to dvd!
5,My mom loved it.,Perfect gift for my mom on her birthday. One of her all-time favorite movies due to it holding many memories for her in her past. Made her cry. Pat on the back for me.
2,OHH NO!!!!!!!!!!,"After debuting with the Raydioish 'The Other Woman"",following that up with the Princly albums 'Woman Out Of Control'and 'Sex And The Single Man',then producing the adult soul of'After Dark' Ray Parker Jr. concludes his solo career with analbum of...NEW JACK SWING?Why did he waste our time?I guess henoticed how the industry picked up on the style after the recentbig hits by Bobby Brown and Boyz II Men and thought he'd try to cash in-bad move.Many of these songs such as the slightlychauvanistic ""She Needs To Get Some"",""Love Is So Strange"",""Girl I Saw You"" and ""Love,Sex And Money"" are strong songs withexcellent hooks to them,but that mechanized,artificial New Jackbeat is like too much salad dressing-it softens the vegatables.Thankfully some slower ballad material like ""Til I Met You"",""Anegl"" and the quircky ""Square One"" redeem the overallalbums uncertain air.Too bad Ray had to go out this way-he needsto put out a new album to cover the bad taste of this one!"
5,WONDERFUL,"I was lucky enough to see Ms. Haskell at the Bush Inauguration. So when I saw she had a new CD out, I ordered it immediately. This is a FIND! She is as wonderful on CD as she was in person. I couldn't be happier with this."
3,"Worn out, soft film used for DVD mastering.","First let me say that for $7.99 this DVD is passable. The sound is not distorted, but the video is a little soft and contrasty. It was not bad enough to distract from the viewing on a 36"" screen. It is much better than the artifact ridden Platinum Disc ""8-Movie Set"" version of this title.I give this Alpha/Gotham DVD the lower rating because the film used has seen too many careless TV stations. There are many film splices, and at one point in the middle of the film the damage is so severe that the picture starts jumping up and down for a few minutes.These independent films were not given as much storage care as the later Bowery Boys series, so good prints are hard to find."
1,thee tijmes blame you four times blame me,"Four tines I have ordered aClover Electronics ADT120250 12V/60Hz-250MA AC Adapter for Ultra Miniature Security Cameras - Small (Black)Four times I received a Wisecomm model & UHD12-500 transformer-adapter.After time #3 I communicated. You couldn't understand it, said there was something wrong with the distribution of this product. To be fair, you didn't require me to return the Wisecomm transformers or a shortwave antenna I bought at somebody's recommendation, when the radio I bought had one included.Desperately needing a power supply I ordered Clover #4 and got another Wisecomm.Insanity is repeating a wrong action expecting a different result each time.You know what that makes me."
5,An amazing book,"This amazing book brings together the thinking of some incredible minds in the form of written papers and ensuing discussions across multiple domains and disciplines ranging from cognition, economics, psychology and neurophysiology to biology in an exploration of general systems dynamics. My understanding is that these papers are the product of a symposium held in Alpbach Austira in the summer of 1968. Participants included numerous well known individuals such as Jerome Bruner, Jean Piaget, Arther Koestler, Ludwig von Bertalanffy. This book is a crucial document in the history of the evolution of systems thinking and represents an early forerunner of the current Conference on Thinking."
5,It's Apples And It Covers The Stove Burners--My Wife Is Happy!,"When our old stove covers that were apple-themed decided to go cracking up on us, I knew I needed to find an ample replacement set that would make my wife happy. This one certainly did the trick and we got the added bonus of a little chain on each one that allows you to hang it up on the wall as a decoration while you are cooking on the eye. COOL!"
1,"""Enter"" key in wrong place!","DON'T ORDER THIS KEYBOARD!! Oh, I should have read the previous reviews more carefully... The Enter key is in the wrong place -- the backslash key is where the Enter key is on ALL other keyboards!As a result, it is impossible to get used to typing on this keyboard."
1,"Do not buy, enter key in wrong place","I did read the reviews but some how overlooked the ones about the enter key being in the wrong place. This thing is unusable due to that major oversight. They put a backspace key to the left of the enter key where the enter key should be. There is already a backspace key on the keyboard. Plain stupid design.I ripped the backspace key out. That way at least I hit nothing and I have tactile senses to tell me ""hey dummy, you bought that lame keyboard"". Then I can move a bit to the right and hit enter. Really quashes productivity.I just might rip this thing apart and see if I can move the enter key to the right place. Whats there to lose? A crappy keyboard?"
2,The position of Enter Key is Wrong,"This is a great keyboard but the position of enter key is wrong.Backslash key is at the normal enter key position.To type enter key you need to move your wrist.Even with big enter key, it is really hard to type.If you are not heavy typer, you can use this keyboard happily.But if you are heavy typer, please, stay away from this keyboard.Your wrist will be hurt with this keyboard."
2,Died after couple of months,"I had this attached to a PC in the garage, and it died after a couple of months. Not sure if it is was a problem with the environment -- dust, moisture, etc. I liked it for value/functionality, but be warned it may not be suitable for rugged environments."
2,Not very comfortable for extended typing time,"I used this keyboard for about 4 days and experienced hand fatigue. The keyboard layout itself is good, but you really have to put some pressure on the keys to type. It seems to ""clunk"" as you type. Not for fast typists in any sense."
3,Does not include usb port,"Although it states that it does in the description, this keyboard does not include a usb port."
1,Not for touch typist,Note that there is an extra key between where one positios their right hand over the letter j and the enter key. Very frustrating for touch typists. I threw it out!
2,Strange key placement,"I bought this keyboard to fit underneath a raised platform that I keep my laptop on at work. From a size perspective, it is perfect. I use it with a mac so I have no idea if the media keys work. I don't use them. There are two primary reasons that I rated this keyboard low. First and most important, there is an extra key, the [\] between the [""] and the enter key. I have small hands and this makes it very difficult for me to reach the enter key. The other problem I have with this keyboard is that it is noisy and doesn't have a good ""feel."" I know that sounds a bit nebulous but I actually find myself unconsciously avoiding typing on it and instead elevating my arms to type on the native laptop keyboard."
2,Keyboard without Numeric Keypad,"Returned mine. Tried it for 1-1/2 hours & got aches where I had none. Was hoping to find a regular computer keyboard layout, but without the numeric keypad. This one has no numeric keypad, but manufacturer shortened size of regular keyboard as well, causing keys to be shifted. It's ""too"" small. I'd prefer just a normal keyboard design, but with no numeric keypad, that way my arm would be in closer to my body, relieving muscle tension in shoulder."
1,loud clicking wobbling keys cheaply made,Loud clicking wobbly keys and seems cheaply made. Their are other keyboards out their just as cheap and better. I got a BTC model 6100C from amazon awhile back that looks very similar to this one and costs about the same thats blows this out of the water. I was hoping this was the same but it wasnt. :(
3,Disappointing,"I bought this strictly for the Keta Bill song ""Hold On"" and the version on this soundtrack is NOT the version used in the film. It turns out that the Keta Bill version used in the film was never actually released commercially and is impossible to get. The opening Bob Seger ""Shakedown"" song is about the only song that I enjoyed from this release. The rest is all filler to me. I'd rate this album a ""Meh"" on a AWFUL to AWESOME scale."
1,THE Printer Disaster !!,We ordered a printer on Amazon.com..Not the printer which we are reviewing..The vendor sent the WRONG printer..We called the vendor and they sent us a return mailing label..which we returned immediately..BUT the printer CHARGE is still on mycredit card...They have not done a charge-back with Amazon...The point of this review is donot buy printers from Amazon....
3,DOA,"Received printer, set it up. Would not work. Never even pulled one piece of paper thru. Said ""Paper Jam 2, Check Inside"" on the display screen. Called Samsung. They said to send it to them and they would repair it. Forget that, send back a new product for repair? Contacted Amazon Customer Service. They mailed a replacement overnight and provided free return shipping. Will get the new one today. Hope it works. Speed and cost make this appear to be a good value, if # 2 works..."
2,"a book that, in its quality, does indeed stress","A mediocre piece of writing cluttered with generaliztions.It should have been an essay, then I wouldn't have had to painfully endure over two hundred pages of poor arguments.As a child of this so called ""post modern"" period I can faithfully say this book does not apply to me. THANK GOD."
3,Caution:Nervous Mother Driving,"I just wanted to write a quick note to advise anyone buying this video looking for the episode featuring ""I Think I Love You"". There were apparently 2 episodes with this song. This episode has the song playing while the dog chases a skunk. The episode I was looking for had to do with women's lib where the woman Keith was interested in was offended that the family would singthe song."
3,An O.K Crowd Pleasure,"Now Faith Hill's 1998 set is A lot better than this, but I Personally liked some of this And I don't even Like Countrey. Well, Shania Twain is Okay, but actually Faith Hill is kind of Hot"
1,Slow paced with a violent father and hopelessness of change,"Not going to same much. Hated that Randy Travis played such a bad guy since I love him and his music. Not a positive video or chear you up movie. Bad language, violence and the hopelessness of poverty and the cycle of violent parents producing violent children. This movie was a real downer."
1,Poorly made,"Where should I begin? Poor direction, an unintelligble script, and inconsistent acting doom this movie. The film has an amateurish feel and huge gaps in the narrative. Stay away from this one."
4,works fine,I bought this to power the 3M CT-30 radio thermostat which requires a C wire which I did not have but was able to power the thermostat with this power supply. The ratings matched what 3M recommends for the thermostat.
2,For the Customer with a 3M-50 Filtrete Thermostat,"This device isn't the indicated for the purpose on replacing the ""C"" required for the functionality or powering the 3M-50 Filtrete Thermostat, the amount of volts generated for this device are 28.11V grater then 24V, even thou the Filtrete device it expresses a required 24VAC power to operate the Wi-Fi, but all the devices with output 24VAC generate always a greater voltage that's what the AC (Alternate Current) stands for. There is a risk of ""Blowing Up"" the 3M-50 Thermostat by using this device as replacement for the ""C"" wire.Furthermore I want to mention that Filtrete have a bad recommendation on the package when stating ""Requires 24VAC Power to Operate the Wi-Fi Connectivity""; after speak to technicians from this manufacturer they have advised me to use a 16VAC instead because this last one will produce up to 19.80V enough volts to power up the 3M-50."
2,Disappointing,"I liked Larry Millet's first two Sherlock Holmes mysteries and looked forward to this one. The subject matter seemed perfect for mystery and Minnesota history. Too bad. The book reads as though written in haste. Rafferty is superfluous and gets in the way. Mary Comstock's appearance on the scene is awkward, confusing, and difficult to believe. There is never any doubt about what Holmes will conclude as to the rune stone's authenticity, and the solution is far less interesting/mysterious than the real-life rune stone story. The murderer's identity is not a big deal and is not really solved by deduction. The historical details, which ordinarily are Millet's strong suit, are weaker here. Despite all that, it wasn't a bad read. The point is that Larry Millett has done and should do better."
3,Rochester?,"This book did not live up to my expectations based on the prior two books. Can anyone who has read it figure out why Kensington didn't know what the reference to ""Rochester"" meant? This lapse in thinking by the author put a big damper on the book as far as I am concerned."
5,I love it!,"I've had this game for a few years and still play it all the time. When ever I have a lot of free time I'll play the none campaign one and spend hours taking the other computer players down.It's really easy to learn and the options to make a custom game are pretty good there could be a few more but the ones there get the job done.The game works fine on all the computers I've played it on (W98, XP, Vista) I've never had a massive bug so it works well.I would totally recomend this to people looking for a fun easy game."
2,Better graphics than the first game,"But the play is not nearly as fun or easy to do. The characters get lost among the building, there isn't much in the way of an aerial view. You have to constantly move the view one way or another for you don't see very much of the landscape. I will admit that the graphics have the first game beat hands down. However, I still play the first one, but not this one. The Fryhtans are more viscious than in the first and there are artifacts you men can acquire."
1,Don't Bother...,"With the number of games out there right now, there are so many better choices to choose from. It's a newer game, yet the graphics are inferior to the original Age of Empires and the play doesn't even come close."
1,The old formula was so much better!!,"I loved the old version of this hairspray, and was so disappointed when they discontinued it last year. The old did not have bamboo in it - it had fruit micro-waxes and it held great, smelled great, and did not weigh hair down. This new version with bamboo does not hold well at all and it causes my hair to look dull and feel greasy and heavy right away. I hope Garnier will bring back the old formula - I miss it and haven't found a hairspray that compares."
1,Bad Hair spray,"this hair spray is really awful, you spray a little bit and it still makes your hair really hard like gel, and it makes your hair look all hard, it's hard to style withif anyone wants to buy this product buy any type of hair wax, don't buy the garnier hair wax buy another brand, and then use the hair spray"
3,Throwaways tied together with a few big tracks,"Like most of the Tom Petty 90s albums, Into The Great Wide Open consists of a few big tracks fleshed out with throwaway filler tracks. This album wouldn't have been any poorer without mediocre tracks like Two Gunslingers, All or Nothin', Too Good to be True, Built to Last and Makin' Some Noise. Petty classics like Learning to Fly, All The Wrong Reasons and the title track take up some of the slack, but ultimately this album is best described as ""easy to listen, easy to forget.""If all you want is some simple radio rock, this is a good buy. If you want something with a little soul, you won't find much satisfaction here. Rather try Petty's first few records or 2010's Mojo."
3,Lacking something,"Starting with another take on the rock and roll dream going sour, (I blame Bad Company for starting this trend) Into the Great Wide Open is off to inauspicious start. Things don't immediately get any better. From the repetitive ""Learning to Fly"" to the trite ""Two Gunslingers,"" this CD lacks the originality and emotion of Petty's other work. But it's not a total waste of time with a good rocker like, ""Makin' Some Noise"" and lyrical gems like ""Out in the Cold"" and ""Built to Last"" to be found. It's just not up to Petty's usual standards."
4,"WHAT THE HECK is ""In the dark of the sun"" ??????","""IN THE DARK OF THE SUN "".......SAY WHAT ??? I don't get it. This is tom petty's worst song ever. I like the album, it's fun but that song is enough to drive me crazy. The title song is as well, ( in to the great wide open ), its good but once you herd it.....You herd it....AND thats fine ( NO REPEATED LISTENS ). But the rest of this album is pure magic, fun, and doesn't get old with age. This is a good album, Just 2 weak songs."
1,"Tom, what happened?","Man this is a lame album. I don't know if TP gave up subtances or alcohol prior to writing the songs for this album but if he did he should go back on them. This is terrible. Lackluster, dull, uninspired and cheesy. TP's first couple albums he comes off as this wirey little prick who you'd better not mess with, and it showed. His music had attitude and cajones. But this stuff...man, it's like he morphed into my grandpa crossed withMichael Bolton or Peter Cetera. Ish."
2,Unlistenable 80's cheeeeeze,"I really enjoyed this movie, and within the context of the film, the songs act as a fitting soundtrack. Perhaps it's all the spikey, geled and buffant hair, dolphin shorts, Reagon/Bush era snootiness or cluncky jewelry that mandates 80's visuals to have 80's sounds?However, listening to this, independent of the film, is rather difficult since the syncopated drums sound too corny and the overprocessed guitar too cold.The cover of the Stones' classic ""Amanda Jones"" is terrible, I mean really terrible! The closing cover of the classic ""Falling in Love with you"" is the only quality tune since it is a fun, upbeat version. UB40 would later make their upbeat version render this one just a remnant from the film."
5,Good Stuff,"While the soundtrack is probably good enough to stand on its own, it's so much better if you've seen the movie. It's a great sampling of the music of 1987, as well as a deft illustration of the film itself. Tracks 2,4,8,9 and 10 are my favorites, probably because they were the most prominently featured in the film, and I can ""see"" the movie when I hear the music. The only thing I would change about this album would be to include MORE music. There is still a lot missing, such as the OTHER version of ""Miss Amanda Jones"" (played as Keith, Watts, and Amanda get ready for the date), as well as the musical score (i.e. the strong opening number to the film, the soft keyboard lullaby during the more tender moments, and the final ballad playing as Keith catches up with Watts). By the way, if anyone reading this happens to know where I can get this music, PLEASE let me know. But back to THIS album: a thoroughly enjoyable soundtrack, and a great companion to a great film."
1,How about Doctor's WORST!,"If the purity is guaranteed - where are the lab tests?!?! I have tried this product on numerous occasions, all with the same result - NOTHING! Taking amino acids for the past 15 years I have learned a few things and simple tests. This Tryptophan is by far the ugliest I've seen. It does not even dissolve in water!! There are other brands out there that are far superior, and I have had great success with. The only conclusion I can come up with is that there are nasty fillers in this product - STAY AWAY!!"
1,Waste of time and money.,The production of this video was poorly done and seems to focus more on products than actual woodburning. It may contain about 15 minutes of useful information and the rest is just poor production with the producer clearly in the background telling the artist what to say and do. You can learn twice as much information on techniques from almost any web page for free. Save your money and time and look elsewhere for woodburning techniques.
1,WARNING. Most recipes NOT top-rated.,"I was hoping to find 200 top-rated recipes from allrecipes.com. The site itself does not sort recipes by rating, so you must scroll until you find ""IT""--a recipe like Baked Pork Chops which received a 5-star rating from 1488 cooks! Now, that inspires confidence!This book will not provide you with tempting photos and 5-star recipes rated by thousands of cooks. Instead, unfortunately, these recipes' ratings are all over the place. For example, several were rated by only 7 cooks----7 cooks who only gave them four stars. And, oh, yea, the only photo is on the cover."
2,"Does not specify, but this stand is NOT compatible with 9000 series PS2!",I received this stand under the influence that it worked with all slim Playstation 2 models. I have a 9000 series Playstation 2 and it DID NOT work with the 9000 series!!! but I also have an older Playstation 2 7000 series that it did work for. Even on that 7000 series Playstation 2 it was a bit loose and moved.
4,Nice for inexpensive pans.,"These are obviously not top-of-the-line pans, but they are really great for inexpensive pans. They aren't really heavy, but they are a nice size for cooking omlettes or small side dishes. The non-stick finish is great."
1,Our netting snapped the first day,"Our Franklin net broke in multiple places on the very first day. The netting itself snapped in less than 20 pitches. You'd think my son was Nolan Ryan. He throws, at best, 40 miles an hour. We returned the set and was given a new one, and that lasted about a month before its netting also snapped. I contacted the company, but they wouldn't return my emails. Absolutely appalling. Buy any other net system, but do not buy Franklin."
2,doesn't last but fun useful for short season,"The rubber 'springs' break easily and begin to crack after a few weeks outside. Some even broke during the first few uses (with a regular baseball thrown by a 10 y/o). The adjustable tighteners we got with the unit didn't hold their position and we fixed it with some old tighteners from another unit we had just thrown out. Don't expect this to last more than a season of practice, if that. Dissappointing!"
3,"Great, but does not hold up well outdoors.","Its great while it lasts, but, Unless you want to drag it in and out everytime you use it, dont expect it to last more than a few months. The sun/elements seem to rot out the rubber that holds the netting taught. This started within the first month we had it and has continued until now, most of the net is so loose, it is useless.Also, I have to agree with the other reviewer on the assembly, OUCH! Its really painful to put this together, the last few hooks are extremely hard to stretch.We need to purchase a new one but I am not sure if the rubber problem is exclusive to this brand, or if it will happen on others as well. This one is the least expensive Ive seen, so perhaps thats the problem."
2,"Poor design, does not fit well","I love other Melissa and Doug puzzles, especially the ones with the peg but was really really disappointed with this one. The pieces don't really fit well together, they are all similarly cut so it's really difficult to put together and since they don't really lock into place but move around easily it's really hard to put the pieces together, made my boy really frustrated. It just looks very sloppily chopped into pieces. Wish I could return it....I've used it once and will now be going in a box in a closet. waste of money."
1,do not order melissa and doug chunky puzzles!!!,"Back in 2006 when my first son was born I loved the Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles!!! Each piece was completely painted, had rounded edges, and we purchased all 7. When the sea animals one came out we immediately got it and I was very disappointed. The front is a sticker, they are not painted, the edges are rough, and the overall quality felt cheap. When I saw this fire truck puzzle I gave it a shot, but it was the same poor quality. I wish Melissa and Doug would go back to their old ways."
4,Great Puzzle,I bought this for my son after he had played with it with his Occupational Therapist. He loves Firemen and puzzles.I gave it an overall 4 stars because the only problem we have had is storage and losing pieces. With it not being in some kind of box it can be easily spilled. But it really isn't a flaw...just be careful with the pieces.
5,A superb album from BB,There is always one more time is amongst the finest albums from BB King.This is a great album which shows BB King at his best both on vocals and guitars.Each and every song is a classic and this album is highly recommended.
1,Hero is a rapist. How charming.,"Consider this a warning, not a spoiler:I liked this book right up to 27% of the way in, when the ""hero"" declares the heroine to be his wife without asking her opinion on the matter, and forces her sexually. Yes, she has been attracted to him, but she is not given a choice. He is tall and strong; he pins her down when she is asleep, and bam, it's a done deal. He even apologizes as he is doing it, which indicates he knows full well that she has not given consent.I like a book with a strong sensual element, but sorry, rape is not sensual. It is an act of violence, debasement and control. And the author wants us to believe that the heroine enjoyed it.Words fail me at this point. Buyer beware."
2,to be honest...,"I have to be honest. The book was dragging on and on.. I have only read about half of it. I keep trying to read more of it, but it just keeps going on and on and doesn't really seem to go anywhere. I really wanted to like it."
4,texas lily,I read the reviews before I bought this book and I am so glad I didn't listen to the person who talked about the so called rape. I didn't see any evidence of that at alland really don't understand what she was talking about. It took awhile to get totally into the book and it is a long read but I found it so worth it.
1,Texas Lily,This book just drags. I can't get through it. The plot is very tedious. How many bad things can happen to one family.
5,TexasLily,This is the first time that I have read the author Patricia Rice. The story flowed at a good pace and kept my interest from beginning to end. Liked the characters. I would definitely consider reading another Patricia Rice Historical Romance.
2,Convoluted - forced myself to read it,"This book is so convoluted, I found myself wishing I had not started reading it. It definitely is not one of those books I could not put down."
3,It was enjoyable,It was an enjoyable read. Not great and it dragged a bit for quite awhile. I liked Cade the hero but got frustrated with Lily. I found her a little selfish and got tired of her complaining how she was sorry she married Cade. Very light reading and once she quit complaining the book was enjoyable.
2,Missing Something,"I had read the reviews here and decided to read the book. About half way through the book, I returned to read the reviews again, thinking I had the wrong book.I must be missing something, because after I finished it, I still didn't see what was so good about this book. It drug on and on, often had me confused and wondering what I had missed.Supposedly, this is a love-hate relationship, but I sure didn't see it."
2,so-so...,"This book was just so-so. I feel like there was too much emphasis on Lily being a ""strong woman"" and Cade being a ""half-breed."" Enough, already! I know the book was set in a time when women weren't ""allowed"" to run their own ranch and people of mixed race were not widely accepted, but still... I found it hard to focus on a romance between the two leads because of all the obstacles they encountered. This book did not hold my interest enough for me to want to read more in this series, free of charge or not."
4,Liked it.,"The book was enticing from the start...the Rape part was a little bit 'bitter sweet'....sweet in fantasy, disturbing in reality...however the book dragged on a little bit. Great book to read when bored and need an escape."
4,Texas Lily,"This was a wonderful book to Read. It is the type of book that you do not want to put down. You learnt a lot about how hard life was in those day's in Texas, and it had a really exciting story line, and you always wanted to know what was going to happen next so beware, if you nhave not got to much time to read, as you will not want to put it down. The history is quite good and the story line superb. A really excelent read.Texas Lily (Too Hard To Handle, Book 1)"
3,3-1/2 STARS,"I enjoyed this book and the characters. The plot was well thought out and the character development was well done. I felt that it dragged in the middle quite a bit and would have been much better with some serious editing. But, overall a good read."
5,Great product,I have always enjoyed the Mavis Bacon Typing tutors. This version is excellent and we are really enjoying it.
3,"Has Adware, but a decent tutorial","I broke from my golden rule of buying software from a store when I purchased this program which I have a few complaints about.1:) Netzero adware. How a commercial costing $20 (in the store) puts adware on your computer without your permission is beyond me.2:) Dated visuals. Vista has to temporarily downgrade it's visuals in order to accommodate its games and videos. Also, the font size is far too small and the overall look is from 1995 where CD rom games first started3:) Proceeds too fast from letter to letter. I actually downloaded a free typing software in order to review certain troublesome letters.That being said it will help you to type better (I'm typing fluently with both hands now thanks to this and other software I have found on the internet and I'm still working on my speed) and is decent overall, but I would not recommend it to you unless you don't care about the three complaints listed"
5,Very Helpful,I order this product for my mom to brush up on her typing skills and my whole family uses it. They have fun playing the games they dont think of it as a typing lesson. I even use it to brush up on my speed. Mavis Beacon typying tutor is wondeful and everybody loves and its for all ages.
1,difficulty downloading program,"I cannot rate this product, Mavis Beacon Typing 17, since I cannot access it. Not sure what the problem is but I have a new computer Sony Lap Top with Windows What's the problem? Dissatisfied customer.Mavis Beacon Typing 17 (Win/Mac)"
2,Don't jump on this one...,"Gorgio Brunos has to spend eighteen years at Parkhurst prison after being charged of conspiracy to murder during a robbery in Essex where a security man died. As his wife Donna plans to break him out of prison - hence the title of the novel - she is about to discover Gorgio's criminal activities, dealing, among other things, in child pornography.A very lengthy plot with banal ingredients - drugs, crime, sex."
4,Good product,I choose this over the Honeywell 50150 because of the all the ratings saying how quiet the low setting is. It is very quiet on the low setting but I don't think it moves enough air on the low setting to do much good. I always have it on the second speed setting which is a bit louder but my girlfriend who never slept with a white noise machine has no problems getting to sleep. There is a dramatic decrease of dust and particles in the house and I can breath easier.
5,Works great,"Bought for a 440 sq ft room, noticed a huge difference in air within 1st hour. It isn't as noisy as other reviews said. Very happy with the size, small and unnoticeable. Would highly recommend. Great warranty also!"
4,"Well worth the money, best air filtration system I've used.","I researched every air purification system and decided to go with the HealthMate. I have been very happy with it. When you walk in the house, you smell no odors at all and it has really helped with my allergies. It also filters out so many compounds that are found in carpeting, furniture, the air that are really dangerous to your health. You can google ""Vapors, Gases and Fumes removed by HealthMates"" and you will be amazed at the list, almost 300 types of compounds removed."
3,Austin Air Healthmate Jr.,"I got one of these because my neighbor was smoking and it was coming in my bedroom window. It took at least 3 days of continuous use for the smoke smell to go away, and I am still not sure if it was the air filter or the fact that the neighbor stopped. It is fairly quiet on the lowest setting, but it still disturbed my sleep. It does seem to keep the air moving and fresher in a room. It also worked when a skunk sprayed outside my bedroom window, it freshened the air markedly. Not a bad product. I would buy one if I had terrible allergies or rotten air."
5,Wonderful product!,"I checked several websites for air cleaner reviews. After checking the reviews, I felt this one would be sufficient for my needs. This thing works like a champ! Smoke, pet dander and pollens give me sinus infections and headaches. I don't know if there is a way to measure the quality of the air coming out. However, my symptoms are drastically improved and or relieved when I have the air filter running. I have it in my living room which is approx 20x20 and it seems to handle this area very well. I have not regretted purchasing this little air cleaning wonder."
3,Air filtering: 5. Fan Motor: 1,I'm entering my fifth year on my unit and the fan motor died.Last year it was slowing down and would only operate on the highest speed.I keep it running all the time.I like the air quality it produces. The noise level is great.But don't expect to have the motor live long enough to need a filter change after five years.Its now a giant piece of landfill.Summary: clean air in two rooms for $75 per year plus the cost of electricity.This should be the comparison figure on all air filters.
3,Not magical.,"I bought this unit to use in our bedroom to help with my wife's allergies. After reading a lot of the reviews here, my expectations were pretty high. It seems like we do wake up a little less congested, but it doesn't help as much as I'd hoped. My wife still has to take a dose of her allergy medicine before bed.On the low setting, I can't hear this unit at all. On medium, it's barely audible. On high, it's still quieter than most fans on their medium setting."
2,This thing is loud,"I'm disappointed with this unit. It's too loud for the bedroom even on the lowest setting. I think the filtration is good, but too loud. It's gotta be more than the db rating it's published under. In fact, it's loud for any room in the house. Maybe I got a defective unit, but I don't think so."
1,Not worth the money,"I have owned a healthmate junior air purifier for a number of years now. Frankly I can say that it was not worth the money. I bought the filter due to the ""warranty"" on the main filter. What a joke! After getting a new filter 6 months ago the air coming out smells terrible. When I spoke to Austin Air they informed me that they would sell me a new filter for 50% off. Are you kidding me? I just replaced it and they are asking me to spend even more money with them??Bottom line, there are MANY other higher rated air cleaners out there that cost much less money and that are more reliable. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this one."
1,Austin Air HealthMate - a great disappointment,"I read good reviews on the Austin Air HealthMate Jr. I am a smoker and I'm using this product inside a room no bigger than 200 Square Feet. The product did absolutely no good in keeping the room from smelling like smoke. I only use the room approximately three hours a day and smoke only four cigarettes during that time. I keep the product running on high without ever turning it off. The next day, 18 hours of not even being in the house, the room smelled like smoke exactly the same way it did prior to getting this product. I even put it in the middle of the room far from any walls or furniture. I have been using it for about a month now. An absolute waste of money."
1,Never sailed before,"Kim has clearly never sailed. I got this as a gift with the anticipation of reading an account similar to ""Fastnet, Force 10"" and was totally disapponited. Kim's complete lack of understanding of sailing made it almost impossible to understand what he was trying to explain. You don't need to use a lot of ""jargon"" in writing a sailing book but you should be accurate. I knew I was in trouble when the first picture in the book, identified as ""manuvering before the start"", was clearly taken after the start. If you have even a small amount of sailing knowledge and want to read this account to learn something, you'll be disappointed."
5,Loved It!,You are there - Leighton's descriptions make you feel every bump and thud. The author's choice of words and descriptions show a true story teller at work. What a story! I have no desire to sail - ever..
1,A John Kerry love fest,"This book is great for anyone who believes John Kerry should be the next president. I do not believe any book that fawns over the candidates, and this book is no exception. I had trouble getting through it. If you love the man and want to hear only glowing positives, this book is for you."
1,Portrait of a Loser,"Isn't it funny how John Kerry always has a camera ready for certain occasions? If nothing else this book demonstrates that John Kerry had set his political ambitions as far back as 1964 when he first met George Butler.And who is George Butler? His only meaningful success came in the 1970's covering the subculture sport of bodybuilding and a rising personality named Arnold Schwarzeneggar, a man who Butler would later betray ala Judas by creating lies about Arnold having been associated with Nazi's in Europe during Schwarzeneggars successful campaign for governor of California in 2003. Of course Butler would become very involved in John Kerry's bid for President just months later and would go on the talk show circuit on behalf of Kerry.It would appear as though both George Butler and John Kerry were opportunists and are big losers."
2,Unless required...don't buy it,"I needed this for a college course. The stories are not translated well and are hard to understand. Even if you get one easier to read....they're kind of ""What's the point?""...not great literature. Most of the students in my class agreed."
3,"The Good, the Bad, and the Indifferent",There are too many stories here that can not be called great literature. Latin American writing is better than this! This anthology does it a great disservice.
3,"Fun, but no Thriller Diller!","Ken Tanaka is getting his shot at fame in 'Big' Tokyo this time around, thanks to his girlfriends' promotion of his first adventure. The book starts out great, but quickly hits a slow patch. Deadly ninjas, the Japanese Yakuza (Mafia), royal intrigue, ancient swords, the new Japan, and the mystery of buried treasure, et al, somehow adds up to merely a pleasant read. Although it was nice visiting Japan with Ken and friends, the writing could have been sharper. members.aol.com/raywking"
3,A nifty read.,"Being Happa (half Japanese) who grew up in Hawaii, I found Dale's book quite nostalgic. Kind of like talking to an old friend. His main character was friendly and compelling. Although not quite as good as the first book, it is just as enjoyable. Dale's observations on Japan seem to be right on the money!"
1,Not worth it,"I have recently become very interested in this genre after reading the series by Laura Joh Rowland and Massey (Rei Shimura series) and recently ""The Tattoo Murder Case"" by Takagi. Believe me, this is definately not in the same league as those authors. This book starts off very amateurishly, with several disjointed, disconnected scenes by different characters who seem very flat and stereotypical. Usually it's easy to tell within the first few pages how good a book will be, and I was bored stiff after the first 3 pages of this book. I'm sticking with it since I spent money to buy the book, but, had I been buying this in a bookstore instead of Amazon and browsed through a few of the pages first, I probably wouldn't have bought it. The other authors I mentioned above are MUCH more enjoyable reads."
3,A First Time Reader,"This is my first exposure to the author and his detective character. I can say the book was fun and a good filler for unoccupied time. I would not assign it any more importance than that. There is some suspense which is diluted by the absurdity of the plot. Tell me how a 500 year mystery is solved in one week by an amature detective that doesn't even speak the language. (I'm not in the market for brides either.) The best parts include some insight into Japanese culture, but don't pick up the book solely for that purpose. It was an average read in my estimation."
5,Beautiful music!,This has been a wonderful CD to listen to - very soothing and relaxing background music while I read and unwind in the evening.
1,Very Disappointing Model,"I bought this for my son for Christmas and he was so excited about it he actually got started painting. He finished the painting and was excited about assembly, but these pieces don't go together and the instructions are misleading. The main body wouldn't glue up well even with a ton of extra super glue gel. In the words of my son, 'It is a total piece of crap'. He is still putting it together, even though it doesn't fit. If I had known it was this bad I would have bought a more expensive model from a better company, so, hopefully, you won't make the same mistake I did."
3,A good start.,"There are many useful phrases in this book. You can definitely to hold a conversation with this book at your side. However, I was expecting more, but It's still a pretty good book."
2,strange sizing,"I am size 7 and can see that the shoe length is ok. But when setting my foot into it, it have like a bump that makes it impossible to wear."
5,"GOOD QUALITY, GOOD COLOR, GOOD LOOKING",I bought another Kenneth Cole model at Amazon and my husband was in love...I bought this model to make him use another par of shoes.. And now he use both 2 0 3 times at week...EXCELLENT QUALITY
2,Not true to size,"I bought this pair of shoes because the look really good but the shoe doesnot run true to size, I bought an 11.5m and had to return it because my instep could not enter the shoe. Be very caefull when buying I suggest buying half a 1 size bigger than your average size."
4,Good book for BBA student,"It is a good book if you want to get some excel skills rather than some statistic principles. It is helpful for practicle usage without needs to understand the underlying statistics principles. Honestly, the statistic parts in this book is quite like high school."
4,Great statistics resource,"I purchased this book as a requirement for my statistics class in the MBA program a few years ago. The textbook does not provide lengthy explanations or theories behind the methods but does provide excellent examples and solves problems showing each step. In addition to the book, the accompanying PhStat Excel add-in is excellent and very easy to use. The Excel add-in is also very handy should you need statistics in `real-life' (must better than whipping out a book). These two elements combined with an excellent teacher can be very effective. As with any statistics book, if you are not mathematically inclined, this book may seem difficult to understand."
1,All Around the Mountain...,"This book is mind-numbing, as are statistics in general. The authors used a lot of words to communicate their message, taking you ""all around the mountain"" to get where you need to be. You must do a lot of filtering while reading to get to the subject matter and understand the concepts."
1,Horrible Book. Makes Statistics like rocket science!,"This book was not written by statistitions, rather by math teachers. Concepts are hard to grasp and the material is very dry.Very poorly explained. Makes even measures of center something very easy into something utterly hard to grasp with their examples.stay clear from this book."
5,Wagons Ho,"At last we are getting to see some good, wholesome family entertainment that we so enjoyed in the 50's and 60's. Wagon Train was a major hit that depeneded upon good writers, excellent actors and excellent guest stars. To this day, fans (old and new) write to websites extolling the virtues of the show and how it influenced them to be better people and instilled good values in their lives.This second season collection is an improvement upon the first season as the discs are now easier to remove and replace in their cardboard sleeves. Timeless Video has done a great job on the graphics.We can soon enjoy the third season which will be availabe for distribution in May. Hopefully, Timeless will continue to publish the fourth and fifth seasons which completed the best of the 8 years in which the show ran. There is already a color season collection available, but the show never quite gained its popularity and prestige after Ward Bond died and Robert Horton left the show."

2,"Save your money, but read on for a recommendation","I find this book a massive overkill. Too much information and too many examples on each usage situation. I preferKodansha's Basic English-Japanese Dictionary (Japanese for Busy People)that also gives similar usage information. By being more concise they are able to cover more ground.Having offered this critique I have to recommend two of the second author's other books, which I have found very useful. I've readJapanese Core Words and Phrases: Things You Can't Find in a Dictionary (Power Japanese Series) (Kodansha's Children's Classics)andBasic Connections: Making Your Japanese Flow (Power Japanese Series) (Kodansha's Children's Classics). They are both definitely worth getting."
5,NINJAS RULE!!!,"This movie is by far the best ninja movie I've ever seen. If you are looking for a good ninja movie with intense sword fighting, plenty of blood and severed limbs than ninja assassin is what you are looking for. The ninjas in this movie use more stealth tactics than any other movie that tries to portrey ninjas by using the shadows against there enemies and moving without sound. One of my favorite parts is when the SWAT team is is being ambushed by an army of ninjas in a dark factory. Awsome use of ninja and shadow special effects."
3,Pretty Good - SUPER Gory,"This movie is ok. The acting BAH-LOWS, and the CGI blood is a bit on the cheesey side. The action scenes, however are really good, especially if you're a fan of the martial arts film genre. Worth a rental but I probably wouldn't buy it."
5,EXCELLENT,The movie was great and quite intriguing for the beginning to the end of it. Had a little too much blood in it but I guess thats what happens when you utilize such weapons and it is a situation of your life or theirs in a deadly mortal kombat.
2,All style with no substance..lame,Ninja Assassin is loaded with action...and that's all it has..The action is surrounded by an unlikeable cast of characters and a horrible story...even for a B-movie. Action scenes are overdone. They are loaded with too much fake CGI blood & tricks. Even the shurikens are fake. Dialog is just painful to listen to. A very slow and uninteresting movie..the blood and gore wasn't worth waiting for in this mess.. I was hoping the whole cast would die..The only positive thing to say is that the soundtrack on the Blu-ray version is quite good. If you have a 5.1 or 7.1 sound system you're in for a treat. Too bad the movie sucks..Save your money.
4,Awesome,"Not the best acting or story line, but if you are in the mood for a great in your face action movie. This is it. I would also steer clear of this movie if you don't like gory movies, because there is a lot of blood. But that is really what makes the movie. I've recommended it to all of my friends, and I'd recommend it to you too."
3,ok ninja movie,This is a pretty good movie for ninja. Great action but I just wish the story is a little better.
4,Great Story Line/Action!!,I didn't give it a 5 star because it was a little to bloody/gasping for me but I LOVE karate movies. The nite fight scenes added suspense which I love also. :). Just a liiiiittle too graphic when a head got chopped off. Eeek!!
5,Ninja Assassin,"Ninja Assassin is a great movie,If your into Ninjas,Ninja Movies and Martial Arts Would Recommend. I was surprised at how good it was. Seeing as many people didn't like it,rotten tomatoes,etc. But I rented it and Really like it.Since there is No Ninja Movie that can compare in my memory, It's one of if not the Best Modern one."
2,CGI Ruined This Film,"This film could have been really good if they just dialed back the CGI.In fact, the film just took too many things a step too far.If I were a 14 yr old boy, i'd probably think this was the best ninja movie ever.Unfortunately, I'm in my 30s and have half a brain.Film feels more like ""anime"" than a movie. In fact, it probably would have been better if it were anime. The story, feel, and violence is just too cartoony to work in the real world. Including the contrived ending.If you are in the mood for completely mindless action and a story that feels a tadforced, then by all means, get this movie. Otherwise, this is an easy pass.amnightus"
5,Sho Kosugi is back!!!,"I originally saw Ninja Assasin in the theatre and it blew me away. Now THIS is a martial arts movie worthy of even the Run Run Shaw label. It has all the right elements and it does not skimp on the blood. If you want to see a really good popcorn movie - N. A. is it.Suprise #1: A pop singer stars in this movie as the rogue ninja fighting his former comrades. Suprise #2: He is superb in the role. His stunt work is impressive as well as his acting. The atuff with the Kyoketsu shoge (whip chain) was amazing.Surprise #3: The director of this film knows his craft - the fight scenes were well choreographed and edited and the movie moved along at a good pace.The biggest surprise: Sho Kosugi, Mr. Ninja Theatre himself, is in this movie portraying the Ninja clan leader. If you like films like ""Shogun Assasin"", then buy this film.I can't wait for the sequel!"
5,"Wow what a ""bloody"" Good time...and then some","This movie was Awesome Expecialy if your a fan of Action flicks and/or Ninja films. This movie hase it all Ninja's, Fighting, Ninja weapons, Sho Kosugi, Rain and well lots and lots of Blood and Violence.The Acting as in all ""Ninja"" Movies require's a cirtian type of person and well all of the actors in this film fit it perfect.The Story is rather intresting it leads right into the action and leaves ya there.The bottom line here is this movie is a awesome ninja flickIt dose earn it R rating for lots of blood, lots of violence, a little cursing. So all the kids out there looking to get a ninja flix fix look else where b/c this film is not ment for the kids.."
4,Martial Arts movie,"This movie is surprisingly good - it somehow manages to combine both massive amounts of blood, rather too much actually, with the beauty of martial arts which as always, done right, is like a dance. Rain, who plays the hero of this show, is excellent!"
5,Thoroughly entertaining for those who love action flicks,"If you love action flicks, then you will enjoy this movie. The special effects combined with the athleticism of Rain was just amazing. This is one awesome movie!!"
5,Best Kung Fu Movie EVER,"The fantastic story combined with some of the most advanced cinimatic magic makes Ninja Assassin the most exciting, graphic, action packed movie full of suspense and special effects that look amazing. This is a movie worth the extra couple dollars for the BlueRay. The digital sound and picture quality makes the movie just as dynamic as it was on the silver screen. I love this movie!"
5,Great movie,"The bottom line is, if you like sword play, throwing stars and all that stuff, buy this movie. You will not be disappointed. The special effects, awesome and that's why I give it 5 stars."
4,Very action packed,Loved the action...the story line didn't quite flow but it was well put together. The stars of this film were awesome.
2,Meh,"Quite a bloody film. It was kind of what I expected, but I wasn't as excited about it as I had hoped. I found the flashbacks to his childhood more interesting than the rest of the film. It was entertaining though. Glad I only rented it instead of buying it."
3,No Story,"Good old school action in the vein of Lone Wolf and Cub. Story is BS. If you want violent action, its there. More a rental then a purchase."
2,"Decent Trailer, B movie acting","Concept from trailer seemed like fun, but the execution was poor. Some Kung Fu scenes were OK, but the plot and acting were terrible."
4,"Action, action, action!","Make no mistakes, this movie is bloody. Packed with Matrix-style martial arts and ninja stars flying everywhere, this is the ninja movie. Far from the almost seemingly campy Sho Kosugi movies of the 80's. ""Ninja assassin"" brings forth characters that are larger than life. I enjoyed Rain in this movie and did not find out until much later that he's actually a pop star in Asia. You would never know it. The story is good but the acting is somewhat mediocre in parts. However, if you're looking to a ninja action movie for great acting, you need to get your priorities straight. All in all, I enjoyed this film and I'm sure you will too"
3,Bloody action movie,"This is a really bloody movie. The story was alright, and the action was decent, but I feel there is unnecessary and excessive blood in this movie. Definitely not for kids. You may see as many blood as any of the ""SAW"" movies."
3,Great Action ALMOST Makes Up For Clunky Plot,"I knew going in that a movie with a title like this not to expect Shakespeare, and I was right. This is one of those movies where the action is great (and it is great) and the plot exists mainly to get us to the next fight. What I will give credit to are a series of flashbacks showing the protagonist's training and his relationship with a girl there. This gives the plot some emotional weight to it, and I thought the ending scene was a nice way to finish the film. Unless you're a hardcore martial arts fan, you are probably better off just renting it."
1,That's not how its suppose to be,"When I saw this movie I was not too happy with it. It just didn't make sense to me how one man could take down an entire clan of ninjas. That's like an ant winning against a human, its just not possible. Even the grandmaster who has spent his whole life studying martial arts and the art of being a ninja was bested by his own student. Sure it is possible, but against 100 other well trained ninjas? Just too fictinal for me."
2,This is like an unintended comedy to me,"Nowadays, every karate or Wuxia style film is continually trying to show more blood, and intense severings of people's arms and legs, and even the smooth slicing of half of someone's head right through the middle of their face.What some people might find horrifying, I thought was comical and extremely unrealistic. But, bloodshed is bloodshed, and some people, I guess, just can't get enough.I understand that Rain is a popular Korean singer and really knows how to swoon the women. I wonder what Korean women think of him now? Could they look past the killing and the bloodshed and still love him?"
3,"Good movie with an ""if, Bad movie with a ""but"".....","Technically, this movie is awful. The script is poorly paced and the material is extremely shallow even for a kung-fu movie. The special effects are a bit cheesy (although some claim that this is a throwback to the visual effects of old-school kung-fu movies, despite not matching the seriousness of the movie's tone). People that aren't fans of the martial arts genre will be spending their time wondering how this movie even got made.However...those that don't take movies too seriously and enjoy martial-arts action movies are in for a treat. The fighting scenes are quite good and the cinematography is pretty solid. Fans of old-school ninja films will appreciate the gratuitous violence and blood splatter. The story is seriously one of the worst I've ever seen, but I can appreciate the difficulty in weaving ninja clans into a contemporary setting.If you're in it for the ""Fightan and Butt-Kickan"" then this is your movie...otherwise move along."
4,Ninja Assassin,"movie was bloody and gorie. Too many scenes shot at night which made it a little too dark for my taste. could have had a better script and plot. Typical kung fu movie, alot of action and killing not much of a plot. Ok, as a martial arts movie"
2,Ehhh!!,"Um This movie was not all that good, it has great special affects because the protagonist and antagonist are not martial artist. The movie was kind of entertaining because of all the blood and special affects but if you are looking for real martial arts..this is not it!!!"
2,dissapointed,"i recieved the video in good time, but it was missing the digital copy code. the disk is here but no code. I will update this review ifI am sent the diital copy code(and it works)."
2,A Little Disappointing But Not Bad,"I wish this movie would've used less CG blood and focused more on the ninja clans as opposed to the Interpol investigation, but I thought it was pretty good. The action could've been more clear at times, but Rain carried the movie well, and Sh Kosugi was perfect... I actually wish the film was all about him. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't own it.Should you buy this? Do you like ninja movies? Bloody action? If so, go for it. If you're expecting a perfect film, don't. It is entertaining, but it's not anywhere near as good as V for Vendetta (the director's other work)."
2,"Cool Cover Art, Bad Movie","I love Martial arts movies. I love over the top violence. A movie doesn't have to be realistic to be good. Especially a Ninja movie. I don't expect the plot to be deep either, I mean it is called ""Ninja Assassin"". But it does need to be internally consistent and the action scenes can't all be done in CGI.*****Spoiler Alert*****1.Explain to me how ninja can obliterate swat team in one scene, and then become cannon fodder for them in another.2.The same ninja / cannon fodder decapitate and dismember swat team but the head-grand-master of the clan can do no more but inflict surface wounds on the main character. Really?!If you are going to do CGI based movie, atleast give me the behind the scenes features showing the hard work of the special effect technicians and stunt men.Crappy movie, with crappy fight scenes. 1 Star for cool Cover Art, 1 star because the movie has Ninjas in it."
1,Korean pop artist Rain is popular because of his singing but ....,"- The fighting scenes get so much help from camera tricks, and CGI animation that they look obviously fake. For example, when Rain used a bath towel to fight a female ninja in the laundry room. At first glance, it looked interesting. However, after a closer look, I found they had awkwardly utilized camera or CGI tricks. Also, in the last scene, the firefight where Rain fought against his former master, the environment was so dark, I could hardly see a thing. I was told the darkness was used to hide the wires or some other cinema tricks. I believed so.Besides, the action look stiff and not realistic. No, the martial art skill of this movie is not comparable to that of Tony Jaa , Jackie Chan , Sammo Hung and Donnie Yen.- The acting leaves so much to be desired. The dialogue does not help either.In short, Korean pop artist Rain is popular because of his singing but he's not a promising action actor."
5,Excellent,"Movie came to me in excellent shape and well ahead of time(3dys)i was kind of skeptic about ordering but now it wont be the last time ,i recommend you give it a try ,you wont be disappointed"
5,killer fight scenes,"Wasn't expecting this movie to be soo good, unbelievable action and pretty good storyline.It is not for the faint of heart. There needs to be a sequel!"
4,Ninja Lore Raised to Super-Heroe status,Good action movie in the realm of fantasy action adventure. Story is far fetched but it's a movie. I wasn't really expecting anything realistic in terms of the martial arts. Update to the older ninja movies such asRevenge of the Ninjawith modern movie making techniques. Movie meets the goal of entertaining the audience it's aimed at.
4,Practical and easy to read,This book was exactly what I was looking for. Ideas are broken into age appropriate sections which is very handy. Author doesn't assume that parents have endless funds to spend on resources and doesn't push a particular style of education. Tips are innovative and practical.
5,A great reference,"This book pulls together a ton of publicly available information on the unmanned Mars probes from the United States, tracking the changes in our understanding of the Red Planed. The bonus CD has, among other things, a cool short film starring Carl Sagan, showing the experiments on the Viking landers that were to show whether there is life on Mars."
2,Enjoyable but Forgetable,"Plot- 10 people are put on a deserted island and are filmed as they search for the $10,000,000 prize but someone is killing them off.The story line is a lot like the horror-comedy ""Scream"" mixed with the ""Survivors"" TV show.This video has very evident bad points and good points. On the bad side, they were probably trying to be campy and funny but it is not very funny. Everything is under-done - the cast is stiff and the camera techniques are slow and awkward. The soundtrack is irritating.It would fare better with one really funny person or a little slapstick. I'd advise you don't spend much money on this.On the good side, it features many very, very beautiful women, frequent topless-ness and it is set in the most beautiful island settings you will ever see (Fiji)."
4,great overview,"This book is a great overview of the cowboy action shooting sport. The only negative is that it only had one chapter on the mounted action shooting, but overall it is colorfull and fun to read. Covers many of the basics and the background."
2,Poor Volume,"While the Olympia OL5800 is packed with features and style, when it comes to function this phone fails. The Olympia's switch out earpiece plates block most of the ear speaker causing the volume to be extremely low even when using the phone's loudest setting. Further, for those who like to cradle the phone on their neck, the Olympia is designed in a way which makes this almost imposible. While it looks great -- the Olympia is not functional."
2,bad company,"This phone worked fine for eight months until the charging unit suddenly quit working. The manual gives a phone number for a customer service help desk--but the problem with that is, the number is always, always, always busy. Not even a ""Your call is very important to us"" or ""Please leave a message"" recording. Just BUSY.This phone comes with a one-year warranty, but the company (""Wave Industries"") won't accept returns without a return authorization number--which can be obtained only through the customer service number. And there is no other contact information. After three weeks with no cordless phone and no access to the ""help"" desk, I gave up and bought a new phone. An AT&T;."
1,Horrible voice quality....worst phone I have had till date,Dont buy this phone. I usually have a very hard time listening to the person on the line. I got this phone from fry's as it was cheap after mail in rebate & I regret my decision now.
5,a great record that I never tire of,"I can just listen to this thing endlessly. To categorize this as ""Latin Jazz"" as another reviewer has done is really too confining. Almario is a fantastic fusion player and composer, as evidenced by the last two tunes on this record (Rumbon and Welcome). If you love jazz/fusion ... Almario blends the great sounds and ideas from so many other great fusion players like Weather Report, Passport (Klaus Doldinger), Special Efx (Chieli Minucci) and so on. How Almario has escaped more attention is beyond me. Buy it and love it!"
3,"Nice necklace, low grade clasp",I did not like the spring ring clasp on this piece. It was hard to hook the ring. A larger clasp or different type would have made this an ideal necklace.
1,Piece of Junk,The clasp on this thing is very cheap and will seperate from the cord within a few months.My wife found me a couple of other necklaces that have lasted 3 times as long and cost a fraction of this item.
2,"Windows 2000 Server Secrets, first chapters","I haven't finished this book yet, and I don't know if I will, based on the errors and ommissions I've found in the first few chapters. For example in the installation section, there's no mention of booting directly from the CD. More important, there's no mention of the hazards of extremely large boot partitions that can keep a system from booting, either initially, or after a service pack. In the chapter on testing prior to installing, they mention roaming profiles, but don't mention network load. Claim that TCP/IP was invented in 1969."
4,Nice Sturdy Hat,"This is a very nice hat, sturdy too. I purchased this hat for my dad and he loves it. I would recommend it if you'r looking for a nice lightweight hat. It never loses its shape."
5,Great information for young and old.,"I gave this DVD to my 17 month old grandson for Christmas. He and his dad love John Deere tractors. When the DVD started he immediately ran and got his toy John Deere tractor to play with while he watched. He's a little young right now for it to hold his attention for the entire DVD. He left to play with other Christmas toys and came back several times. However, his dad and grandfather watched the whole thing and absolutely loved it. I even learned why the tractor I drove as a kid on a farm in Missouri was called a ""Johnny Popper."" It presents easy to understand information on John Deere and shows great tractors. I plan to purchase more of the series for them."
4,All About John Deere For Kids DVD,A great dvd which we casn't wait until volume 2 comes out. The tractors are great and we must have watched this video 5 times in a row. All the family have watched it so we are now looking out for old john deere's. can't wait to see volume 2 and the toys.
4,Good movie!,"I bought this DVD for my 21 month old son that loves tractors. He likes the movie but it doesnt keep his attention very well. Not many movies do though, its just his age right now. For older kids this movie would be great!"
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!!!,I bought this DVD for my son as a gift for his 4th birthday. He loves tractors so he was excited to open it up and run to the DVD player to view it. The DVD skipped all over the place and you could barely hear the audio much less see the pics. I sent it back and paid to ship it back. Today in the mail I received an Amazon gift card for $7.55. I'm sorry but this is unacceptable business practices!! I paid $12.00 and some change for the DVD and then another $2.40 to send it back and all I'm compensated is $7.55. Since when is it my fault that the DVD was bad to start with then I don't even get back the full amount that I paid for the DVD. This seller is a joke and I encourage anyone that reads this review to NOT buy anything from them. Your business/company is RIDICULOUS and a total joke!!!!!
1,Just an ad,"This DVD is just one long advertisement for John Deere. The songs are very annoying and even my 4 year old son, who loves cars and trucks, didn't like it."
5,Superb entertainment for the little Deere fan!,My son is almost 5 and has been an avid John Deere fan since he was 2. Everything is about John Deere and this video drives that home. He loves it and requests to watch it all of the time. We love that it has fun little facts about John Deere and the history of it. We will continue to buy this series for him in hopes that all of them are just as good if not better than this one!
5,Love it!,"Our son got this from the Easter Bunny in his basket this year. He loves anything to do with machinery & especially John Deere tractors since that's what we have & both of his grandpa's drive too. We thought he would be the biggest fan of this dvd, but our girls love it just as much!"
5,Very Entertaining,My 2 year old LOVES this movie. He sings and dances to the songs. It's the only thing that keeps him satisfied when we're riding around in our truck. He loves it so much that we bought the other three DVDs in this series.
2,Decent but lacking,"A decent followup to her earlier work, however Williams' newest volume does some disservice to her subject matter. Previous reviewers may be too hard and too laudatory as well: it doesn't take a historian to write a great book on typography, but then neither does Williams necessarily succeed. This book is not a tenth of what Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic Style represents to modern users of type; then again, perhaps she was not trying to be as comprehensive, accurate or excellent."
1,"Mmm. Milk, chunky style.","Many people have lauded this book as a wonderful place for sprouting designers to start. For some it well may be the milk they need before attempting to digest the meat brought to the table by Bringhurst or Gill. But, and I know I'm preaching to the choir, this glass of milk has been poured from an expired carton (just had to get in one more food metaphor). Try ""Stop Stealing Sheep"" by Spiekermann & Ginger--great overview, quite accurate, and above all a good read. Start there, leave this one alone."
2,Good For Beginners,This book starts with the basics of gambling on Thoroughbreds and goes to mostly money management issues and strictly mechanical systems based upon final betting odds. Very outdated.
3,Good beggining material,This book written by expeirienced handicapper Robert Rowe is good starting material for the begginer. It explains all the basics the wagers the odds and so on. But when I happened upon this book a year or so ago I already had been handicapping sussesfully for 4 or so years. So I'll assign 2 ratings for the begginer this is 5 stars for the intermediate level 3 stars. And if your advanced don't bother.
4,Very Helpful!,This dictionary is used for help in doing Spanish homework and is quite thorough in its use of Spanish words.
2,First impression-not good,"Well, they are red... and they have see-through glass lids.After reading lots of reviews for this product, I went ahead and purchased it. It came today, and I was shocked at how insubstantial it is. When folks said ""light"" they should have said ""flimsy"". I thought light would be okay because my wrists bother sometimes. Also the handles are hollow tubes of metal bolted to the body of the pans. That's gonna get real, real hot. I'll see how it cooks though. The lids are nice and heavy and I think the straining feature will be of good use.In the past I have had Revere Ware which I liked but didn't like the nonstick. I also have a (still) decent set of T-Fal which has lasted more than 10 years now with no complaints. Pick up the same size pot in T-Fal and this set of Farberware and it's like holding a coconut in one hand and a marshmallow in the other.BUT...They are RED!!! (Which is why I had to buy them in the first place)"
3,Pros & Cons,"Pros: very reasonable & affordable, the set looks very nice, and comes with many pieces (QUANTITY).Cons: Thin, after 2 uses you'll see the outside red coating will start chipping off (QUALITY) and even the inside nonstick coating. This is not good for long-term use."
3,"Decent quality for the price, if on sale",The pots and pans were a little less than I expected but I probably had too high of hopes. They get the job done as long as you don't expect too much. Probably will last a few years with normal use. The set is something I will probably throw away when I move apartments as the hastle of boxing up and moving isn't worth the cost of replaceing. Overall probably priced right when on sale. The straining feature saves you the need for a separate colander. Not worth full price that was listed on the site but gets the job done if you're not a gourmet.
3,Great Value with Decent Quality,"I purchased this set for sixty dollars so I would have to say it was definately a great value. The pans look good and the lids are also attractive glass with a metal handle and red hightlight to match the pans.Overall, however, the pans are not the highest quality. The ""new shine"" has easily faded and they look like I have had them for a year after only a couple of months. In addition, these pans are thin and light and do not have alot of metal to them. I would not expect to be using them two years from now.Overall, I got a good deal for my money. It's a cheap set that offers alot: cooks well, looks good, and will do well for daily cooking if you're not an aspiring chef."
5,Nice set,"This is the best set for the money that I can find. In fact I found the same set (without the extra utensils) for more than twice the price at everyone's favorite department store. Good looking, cleans easily, cooks evenly, etc - much better than the ""get by"" set I expected. It seems to end up on the ""Friday sale"" from time to time; I would wait for that if you aren't in a rush."
4,great deal,Purchased this for 59.99 considerably less than I would have paid in any store. Definitely a great buy!
4,A good buy,I found the set satisfactory to my expectations. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
5,Does what it says on the box,"I'm not one to get excited over cookware, but this set has to be the best value around.It's light and hard wearing, and the draining lids make life so much easier. Also the non-stick surface is the best of any set I have owned, and being dishwasher safe means no more washing by hand(BRILLIANT).What more can I say....It's cookware"
1,not interested,"I am looking for another artist that was on the same sound track with Shy Boy in "":Bar Hopping:"" Does anyone know the artist that was singings at the bar with slick blonde hair, no shirt, and leather pants ( I KNOW GREAT DESCIPTION ) I only heard part of the lyrics, if anyone out there can help me out I would gladly appreicate it.Now dont laugh on the part of the lyrics that I heard.-BURN WITH A FIRE WITH IN YOUR SOULTHERE A MAN WITH A DRUM HE'S BECKIN YOU TO COME.-ROCK & ROLL DOWN THE NILEAS YOU PLEASE YOU WITH A SMILE-OH LOVER IF YOU ONLY KNEWOH LOVER IF YOU ONLY KNEW-AND THE WORDS COME TO YOUR TREMBLINGLIP AND YOU SAY-OH LOVER IF YOU ONLY KNEWWHAT YOU HAVE MISSED.That was all that I could hear over the actors.Thanks,David"
3,Amazing Guitar Work,Buy this record for the guitar and bass work. Dueling solos and slap bass. The guys in this band were incredible musicians.
3,3.5 stars - slick sleaze rock,"Released in 1989, Psycho Café was the debut studio album by Bang Tango, a late arrival to the L.A. hair metal scene. Bang Tango straddled the line between Poison's pop sensibilities and the Faster Pussycat/L.A. Guns sleaze rock sound. The result was an album of sleaze rock anthems that had the slick, polished production of an AOR release. Vocalist Joe Leste does his best Cinderella/Britny Fox impression, screaming his way through the entire album, and guitarist Mark Knight displays a lot more ability than you might expect from this kind of music.Psycho Café has some really good moments (""Someone Like You"", ""Breaking Up a Heart of Stone"") and some really bad ones (""Love Injection""), but overall it's a fun hard rock album from a fun hard rock scene. The band would refine their sound considerably for their follow-up album, 1991'sDancin' on Coals, but Psycho Café is still well worth checking out if you're a fan of the whole ""hair metal"" era."
2,COME ON NOW!!!!,"I think you guys are being a little to harsh. There is more than one good song on this album. There are two. ""Breaking Up a Heart of Stone"" is also a strong cut - almost enough to make me break down and buy this disc. Just almost..."
2,GET IT WHILE U CAN!,"Man, if you really love rock you gotta have this, is one of the best albums ever.Maybe they'll be unknown for ya but you will be not disappointed, this is real rock. This is the antidote for the limpbizkit thing that is everywhere know.Good lirycs, good guitars, man buy before you loose it because it's REALLY HARD to get it, specially new.So don't hesitate and buy it before I do!!!"
2,One great song...,"But the rest is AWFUL. It's a good thing that they released Someone Like You as a single because it is one of the best hair-metal songs ever committed to a CD. Unfortunately, the rest of the CD serves only to make a good frisbee. Someone like You is worth 2 stars in itself, and the rest of the CD adds nothing. Find the single on a compilation disc (or download if you are willing to brave the RIAA) and avoid this album like the plague."
4,Dated but still useful,"Mike Dunbar has probably had more to do with the revival of hand made Windsor chairs using traditional tools and techniques than any other person in the U.S. and his book remains the best single guide to making such a chair. I purchased a copy eleven and a half years ago when I took my first class with Mike and when his book was still in print. I have never regretted the fifteen or twenty dollars it cost. Nonetheless it needs to be thoroughly revised and updated. Even Mike admits there are some serious errors in the book, and some of the techniques he and his students have developed since the book was first published will yield a better chair with considerably less effort. My advice would be to spend the six or seven hundred dollars to take one of his classes plus the cost of meals and a motel room for five days, take copious class notes, and then buy the book as a good reference work for subsequent chairs."
5,Great Book from a great Chair Maker,Having taken Mikes' Chair making class in NH - I know this info is good.Great Book.
5,A great book by a great teacher.,"This is one of the two best ""how to books"" I've ever read. Mr. Dunbar, with all of his experience, was somehow able to put himself in the place of a beginner and transmit his knowledge in a clear, precise, readable manner.I have made about 20 of these beautiful chairs and I always thank my master, Mr. Dunbar, when I complete one."
3,misrepresentation,Book OK but is very outdated. Amazon lists the published date as 1992 but it was actually published in 1984. The seller John Felder gave outstanding service and I would not hesitate to buy from him again.
3,fair price for hard to find book,The quality of the book was as advertised (an ever decreasing occurrence in today's economy)It arrived in a timely fashionI had offered a similar price for another copy and was refused outrightI would use this supplier again if the need arises
2,Tune Plus Needs an Update,Tunes plus is an orphan product which hasn't been updated in some time. It doesn't support Vista or the latest ipods. Be aware.
1,Hated it...never worked,I bought this product and it never worked. There is also no customer service for this company...forget about getting someone on the phone!
5,The only pick for me!,"I've been playing guitar for 20 years and this is the only pick I'll use - delrin, dark pink .96. I've tried every pick imaginable and none compare -- outstanding grip, strength, and durability. Even during these winter months when my hands are cracked and dried out, all I need to do is lick my finger once and these picks stick like glue for the entire session. Don't confuse these with the other Dunlop offerings (gator grip, and gel) -- those are junk! Less than fifteen bucks here for six dozen is an outstanding value and beats all pricing from the other large, online music retailers."
2,lexmark print cartidges,These are rebuilt units. The ink is poor quality. I won't buy them again. I only gave them 2 stars because they did work when installed
1,No Color,"I read the reviews and thought I might try on my own, regardless of the bad reviews. However, I found the SAME thing happened, the Color Ink Cartridge was NOT FILLED. I am about to contact the seller directly."
4,good cartridges,"had some problems with ink cartridges in the past,but this time no problem at all.will order more real soon !!!!!"
2,"Poor and , not worth it",Got a combo pack with a new Lexmark Printer/Scanner and it was poor quality and hardly lasted at all. The color was lacking. It was a start up combination cartridge and not worth 2 cents after a few sheets of the black were printed out.
1,Ink,"I ordered the two pack for the deal but when i put the color ink in, no ink. $30 for black ink.."
4,"Not the greatest, but good for beginners","I am a single, college-aged male and wanted a simple cookware set. This is a great set for beginners.The pans aren't that big; you couldn't cook big meals. Also the skillets don't have lids which is anooying, but not the biggest deal. The pans are non-stick, but they weren't as non-stick as I thought. For example, I cooked an egg in one of the small skillets, but left it too long and had to scrape it off the pan. Despite that, cleaning IS fairly easy.I LOVE the straining lids. It's nice not having to use a colander, but be careful to hold the lid tight! Once I was being careless and my pasta spilled in the sink.Overall I think this is a good set. It's not the greatest, but if you want a cookware set you don't have to babysit and aren't planning on using for the rest of your life, this would be fine."
4,Well-designed tea pot,"Cute, has a removable lid so you can wash it inside, handle doesn't get hot, just a perfect little pot you can leave out on the stove and your kitchen still looks neat. Great price!"
3,"Adorable, Not Durable","These are as cute as can be, and have a soft and cosy lining. They didn't last very long though -- the stitching came apart. And the sole is more rigid than flexible. Better for a really little baby, not a serious edging pre-walker."
5,excellent service,one of my favourite carlton albums with perhaps the widest variety of backings - sax organ etc. the best riff of 'leila' i have heard. excellent production values all round.i really wanted to say what speedy service i got on my order and how well packed it was and everything perfect. ordering from Greece i dont always get orders even accepted. this was first rate. bravo.
1,Buyer Beware - Not the Silly but fun James Ryan Movie,"My reviewer heading says it all. Amazon should warn viewers, bacause not enough detials are given on the web page and they try and sell it with the Ryan ""Kill and Kill Again"" (another silly, but fun movie), one may be stooped (like myself) into purchasing this horrible set of junk."
1,This is NOT James Ryan's movie!,"I also bought this thinking it to be a James Ryan movie of the same title (based on references to another James Ryan movie, Kill and Kill again. Not having the cover image of the DVD, I feel ripped off... :( Not that I'm often disappointed with Amazon, but this time I am."
1,Waste,"I can't believe they wasted the plastic to make these DVD's. To think, I could have used that money for beer."
1,Don't get fooled into buying this movie,"This is bad acting at its worse. Bad props, looks like it was filmed with the grandpas old supper-8. Amazon should be ashamed to sell this move. Don't buy it - it is lousy and should be removed from Amazon."
5,"It's MADISON time, hit it!","A great soundtrack! I like all songs, and I get really happy when I listen to them.Fantastic!B U T.......where are all the other songs????Only 12 songs on a CD, which can contain 20 songs or so!There are a lot of songs I would like to own very much, but they're left out on the CD. You don't own me, mashed potatoes, waddle waddle, do the new continental. And especially the last 2 I mentioned I would like to have oh so bad, but I can't find them anywhere! Releasing them on this soundtrack was my only chance, I searched everywhere for those songs, and on search engines they aren't even reckognized! Why not release a second part to the soundtracks, it could contain many songs from the movie, since so much has been left out.a bit of a bummer!"
4,Best Song Missing,"The reason this only gets 4*'s is because it's without the Bunker Hill tune, ""Hide And Go Seek (Part 1)"".When the LP was first released, I picked up a copy and was also disappointed not to find the remaining songs from the movie.For years I had been collecting the songs that brought my best memoriesof my youth. Here was a chance to add a few of the rarer ones.Since then, I've been able to complete my own collection of the tunes of Hairspray. And yes, ""Hide And Go Seek"" was my number one priority.I found it on 2 different CD's. ""The Golden Age Of American Rock 'n' Roll Vol. 6"" on Ace and the ultra-rare, ""Do You Remember? 30 Original Golden Oldies"" on Mr. Maestro.Luckily, though, ""The Roach"", ""Footstompin'"", ""Mama Didn't Lie"" and ""Nothing Takes The Place Of You"" are included in the Hairspray LP/CD, which are very much repsonsible for its 4* rating.The only so-called weak tunes on this recording are the title track, ""Hairspray"" and ""I Wish I Were A Princess""."
3,the songs are good...,...however there are a lot of really good songs from the movie that were missing from this soundtrack. I probably should have looked more carefully at the track listing :( but what's on it is still awesome. But if you are looking for a full soundtrack with all the songs from the movie you will only get about half here.
4,sometimes the original is best,"This soundtrack is wonderful. The original artists are all there singing those wonderful old songs. I think that's what makes the original hairspray movie so much better(I hope the play is better because the new movie musical did not inspire me at all!). These are some of the roots of pop music and I think that's what was the inspiration for the original hairspray movie....our roots!Thanks John Waters.....Even though it was your sell out movie, it was wonderful in it's innocence!"
1,Not Tolstoi's complete book!,"This is not the complete Tolstoi book in translation - much of the later Russian original book is cut out and the paperback book cuts off long before Tolstoi's full writing ends! Tolstoi's original carries through Peter's wars with Sweden and his later life, this one simply stops at the rebellion. It is not the complete book and should not be sold as if it were."
2,Lightweight,"Doesn't appear to cover the network library AT ALL. Appears to spend first 100 pages on generic stuff like opensource using CVS etc etc and only 1/3 on the 'meat' about how to use NSPR, and coding for mozilla"
3,Too much evangelizing and little technical details,"Unfortuantely the author has spent a lot of 'page real-estate' evangelizing the open-source movement, instead of providing more info on the innards of mozilla.It's still a good intro if you are planning to dwelve into mozilla's source code, but it's definately lightweight."
3,Ok,The book was okay and the ending was sweet but the plot was not believable. What type of mother would do that and not have child protective services called down on her immediatly and have her child taken away from her. The mother in this book was by far one of the worst that I have read about. That was just jaw dropping what she allowed.
5,wade seller ebay,"Wade miniatures #2 is the top book on wades red rose tea and miniatures!!!BEWARE = there is a wade miniatures #3 it is word for word - page for page - price for price THE SAME AS WADE #2 so save money and buy #2 instead of #3,I hate it when I get ripped off by someone who claims to be giving me an updated price guide on a book I depend on.this book in either copy is the BEST for miniatures,"
4,Wades Whimsies,Great book for finding out how much your Wade's are worth and what ones belong to which series. Highly reccommend. Great information .
3,Beware!,"Although Amazon advertises this cap along with the Blue Wave 1.9 liter bottle, it DOES NOT fit that bottle!"
5,"Fun, educational, and durable","I bought this book for my 10 month old who loves lift-the-flap books. His favorite is Dear Zoo. I was looking for more durable lift-the-flap books when I found this one. I like how there are lots of flaps on each page for him to interact. The flaps are sturdy, which is a must for those busy little hands (we have a copy of Where's Spot, but the flaps are thin and my son tore two of them off already). I also like how each 2-page spread has a different theme. Either there's counting involved, or searching for something--hopefully making it a favorite for a long time. The flaps come in diffferent sizes and open in different directions--which is good, but some flaps are very small."
4,Not for young children,"Citizen X is an interesting look at the search for a serial killer as the Soviet Union falls. The frustration of the stifling and rigid government rules that hampers the investigation, a look at Russian beliefs about law, government, and murder. Enjoyable, interesting, and very sad at times. If you are interested in Soviet/Russian life, or serial killers in general this is a good read."
2,muddled,"This guide is very poorly thought out, with near-hopeless maps and a rather irritating tone (gee just gotta out of high school...). The recommendations were generally reasonably sound, though I found the transport details to be out of date (I used 2001 edition). There are better guides on the market (hello Rough Guides and Footprint)..."
4,A must have indeed,"This is a real encyclopedia of war. Includes many aspect of war that never shown in other books, and cross-references for everything. Still, I wish Holmes added time line of history so that the book can be more usefull.I think this book is a standard companion for every home. Useful for everyone."
1,"Sticky, stiff, uneven spray and overly scented","This hairspray is horrible! It sprays unevenly with large droplets that clump up hair, it leaves hair stiff but does not hold style particularly well. The smell is what you'd expect from Garnier - tropical and fruity. Would not recommend at all."
2,It holds; but very sticky,I have fairly thick but fine hair. This really holds and you don't need much. But it really stiffens up and started to tear / snag my hair. Not the right product for me.
2,meh,"its not my favorite really, but i would use this again. i do enjoy the way it smells and the hold is strong and soft but it made my hair frail and brittle"
5,Awesome,"My hair is really fine, so I can't use a hard hairspray. This spray is perfect for me. The right amount of hold without any build up or hardness."
5,Great for everything,I recently bought this item it is truly amazing it does stiffen your hair or crunch your hair or leave that sticky residue PLUS it. Holds curls perfectly and doesn't dry to fast so you have time to shape it
4,Finally a new ACDC concert DVD,This new release is the first live concert CD/DVD release of any kind for the 2008-2010 Black Ice Tour. I've seen the trailer. Looks really cool. And it's ACDC so what more do you want.
1,"Oh no, this blinding-fast editing again!!!!","Can't understand. Well, maybe I do. If previous DVD releases with this catastrophic headache-inducing editing sold, why change it?I went for this with high expectations that this did not follow the same trend of previous releases (not only by AC/DC, but by other bands as well). No such luck. Editing is atrocious, you can barely watch someone playing at all, the takes are all over the place, changing from second to second.Gosh, it's so frustrating. You know the music is there (after all, you're listening to it!), the performance is there, but can simply NOT SEE IT!Avoidable."
2,expected much more,"Good performance but not Acdc at their best, glossy concert image, video partially Hd and partially LowDefinition (dark scenes sky background). Audience caught too much in video but badly in audio. Disappointing audio, Just three stars.High priced.Another malitiuos/negligent release.A lot of people really love pretty average stuff, I can't understand.I won' t buy Dvds/Cds again."
5,"fast, honest, good job!","the dvd is amazing, wish i was in that show! the negotiation was clean as mineral water! Recommended for everyone thinking about buying from these people! take care and have a good day!"
3,"Great music, but not really live.","If you've read the other reviews, you've read that they keep switching from camera to camera. In my opinion that's because this is not really music captured while the video was; it is video edited to follow previously recorded sessions. Otherwise you would hear the thousands of people screaming during the concert. I prefer ""really live."" I enjoy watching it as it was played.Malcolm gets much more camera time this time. I prefer the drummer from Donnington better than this guy; I really don't want to watch someone play drums with a cigarette hanging of his mouth. Not very professional in my opinion. Overall, the music is great as AC/DC always is; but not really a Live Concert in my humble opinion."
1,AC/DC-Not Live in Rio.,"Hello everyone in Amazon land. This is a video of AC/DC playing live. Not a live video. The editing is extremely poor, with very little continuity. One second the bass player is by his amps, the next his mic. How did he get there so fast? One shot Angus is going up the ramp, the next he is by the singer on stage, lightning quick, I know! This really detracts from the viewing expierience. Boo!"
5,awsome-and I reviewed it after it actually came out,"This DVD is awsome.One of the better made ones ac/dc put out as far as way it was made in last few.I liked the bonus features as well like the guitar techs,etc.Much better quality sound and video over past dvd/s,must be advanced newer technology showing itself.Great dvd.If you like ac/dc ,you will like this dvd.And I actually waitied and gave an honest review-waited to review it until after it was actually out and available and I actually saw it,unlike some of the reviews above me who reviewed it before its release date.Amazon shouldn't allow things like that.How can it be reviewed before its for sale?"
1,Bad Editing,"The audience shots are about a minute per song so 20minof this dvd is looking at the audience, Horrible editing.Should of been done better especially since this might be therelast live dvd."
2,"Loved the music, hated the video","I guess a video journalism major was responsible for the editting of this DVD. Way too many camera changes, way too many crowd shots. I want to see AC/DC play. I actually found the video a bit annoying to watch, but I'll play it again for the music."
5,These guys have not missed a beat,"I've been a fan of AC/DC now for the past 30+ years, and I know the band in and out. This concert shows them in their purest form with their original line up when Brian Johnson joined the band in 1980.A few minor flaws in this concert are the 5.1 mix makes you sound farther away from the stage. I prefer to leave it in default 2.0 PCM.Also the setlist should have included ""If you want Blood"" instead of ""Shot Down in Flames"". And should have included some songs from the ""Stiff Upper Lip"" CD.And it is obvious this was filmed over 3 days. In one song, Phil has a cigarette in his mouth, then the next shot he doesn't, then he does in the next shot. Then he doesn't.But overall, this is a must have DVD if you are a big fan like me."
1,Lots of write failures,"This DVD recorder seems to use cheap parts that result in a large % of disc-burnin failures. Even though DVD-R is cheap these days (but not so with DVD-RAM), you'll be much better off and happier with DVD recorders from Panasonic. (The Panasonic DVD recorder/VCR combo is also $200 cheaper!)"
3,"Okay, but we were glad to replace it","We bought this as our first DVD-R, and found it to be touchy and slow. We replaced it with a Panasonic last year and have found that one to work better - but it has had the benefit of updated technology. This one takes for ever to turn on, and the default is the VCR. We mostly use the DVD player, so this was highly annoying. If you are thinking of purchasing one of these, keep looking."
4,NOT THE MINI-SERIES about Albert Speer,"While I was disappointed that this was not the ABC Circle Films mini series, ""Inside the Third Reich"", the story of Albert Speer's role in the third reich, I was pleasantly surpised by the four documentries that were included in the set. I would have been even happier had it been the Rutger Hauer mini series. I guess it pays to wait for the description before ordering. I'll have dig out my laser discs and player and make my own dvd version, until Disney decides to issue the mini series on dvd."
2,Slay me!,"This film is about five troubled teens who are assigned by a court to work in an old abandoned and possessed hospital. It's such a by-the-numbers re-worked plot that even as each of the kids are introduced to the camera a little caption appears under them, so you know who's the 'goth', who's the 'brother' etc... because the producers are assuming you're too stupid to tell - even with their stereotyped clothing on!And possession? A young woman's dolls' eyes light up. Next she's a demon! Huh? She runs around trying to hack at people. But, hey, you have to wait until the last 20 mins for this to occur anyway.There's a tiny bit of nudity.Leave this lemon alone."
4,Steve Grossman at the Sunset Club,"I had never heard of Steve Grossman until this Spring when I saw him perform at the Sunset Club in Paris. This was one of the finest live performances I have ever enjoyed. I immediately when out and tried to find his music on CD, and did find ""Steve Grossman Quartet."" This disk captures him beautifully and brings back memories of that Sunset Club performance. Nearly the whole audience at that performance listened with eyes closed and heads genltly swaying, which is a great way to enloy this disk as well. You will be reminded of John Coltrane and Sonny Rollings and you will be very happy indeed."
4,Great book!,Ive been hooked on this subject for a long time amongst others. It doesn't carry as much detail about some subjects as Id like none the less if your interested then you must read. Im currently reading 'Oswalds Game' and it covers some of the missing details that Ive been looking into for some time. A must read as well. Ive always known that Oswald's involvement was much more than the govt was always willing to admit. The gov't pinned this on him before the assassination even took place.
2,Mercy:(,"OK, wow, are the 4 and 5 stars raters insane? What makes a novel wonderful is not the concept of the piece but the execution. Mr. Jackson has a GR8 concept but, 4me, it was a painful execution, pardon the pun. The entire novel was a tell and not a show. Unsophisticated, almost clumsy writting witout finesse or delicacy of touch. I was rolling my eyes by about pg 3. The author's hand was definately heavy; I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to really connect with the characters & I saw everything coming a mile way. I was writing fiction with this same plodding, forced narrative tone in college &, even as my fiction professor encouraged me, I realized that creative nonfiction & poetry was my forte so I put down fiction, though I really wanted2 write fiction. Jackson may have potential but he probably needs 2try harder or try another genre altogether because ""Colorful Matters"" lacks quite a lot to even get to the good book level, much less a must-read."
4,Great book about a great guitarist,This book is written based on many interviews on people who knew Mike Bloomfield and by interviews made with Mike Bloomfield himself.It's a book of mixed emotions of the troubled life Bloomfield lived and the many musical success's he achieved in the 1960s.Unfortunately the 1970s were not so kind for Mike and he lived in a drugged filled environment which saddens the reader as he should have had a much more fulfilled life.The CD included is from his very early days in 1964 and is quite interesting but not essential listening.A great book on an important musical legend from the 1960s.
5,Listen To This Book,"The cadence of this book moves at a tempo similar to Michael Bloomfield's life and music. Sometimes the words fly so fast they take away your breath; in other parts, every syllable inflicts white-hot pain in your soul. A floating, oral history biography isn't a new literary device, but it's certain the most excellent approach for someone so multidimensional as Bloomfield. Even the most hardcore fan will discover dozens of new stories in this book. To the newly initiated, the book explains a vital period of blues history. I surrendered to the book's spell, which is every bit as delicious and intricate as a prolonged Bloomfield solo on a good Saturday night. The bonus rarities CD is worth the price of admission alone, so how can you miss on this purchase?"
4,Not Bad. Not Great.,"I watched this for Drew and she did not disappoint.This was a very interesting role for her to agree to do...she was quite impressive. Her accent and the way she carried herself was fantastic. I wish it could have gone into more detail...I thought the story was too vague. If I had any questions about what happened they wouldn't really have been answered here...there are too many conflicting stories...it doesn't make sense to me that Amy Fisher was the only person convicted of anything...maybe that's the point?Drew can do no wrong in my book...I'd watch her paint a fence! If you're an admirer I'd like to suggest you buy this film...if you're not, I'd like to suggest you'd at least rent it. It's worth a peek."
2,A movie as innacurate as the papers were.,"I forced myself to sit through this movie when it aired on television the first time. Although the acting was decent, perhaps even good, it was based, unfortunately, primarily on the tabloids and inaccurate accounts in the newspapers/television reports. How do I know this? Simple. I grew up in Bellmore, Long Island and went to school, and was friends with Amy (which, btw, is not the correct spelling of her name, just another instance of the press not bothering to check their facts).I personally feel watching this video, or any movie based upon the unfortunate real life (no matter how inaccurate) events of unfortunate people is tacky at best, but if you're going to watch it, please don't take it as the gospel of what really happened."
4,Best Amy,"The girl who played Amy was phenominal,I saw this on lifetime a while ago.And I don't watch Lifetime,chic channel.But I was definately captivated,and thoughtshe had the accent down,I went to school with and hung out with these chicks.She was academy worthy."
4,good portrayal of Amy Fisher,"I saw this movie and I thought that it was really good.Everyone knows the story of Amy Fisher and knows what she did.Drew took the role, and turned it into a great achievement.She can really play Amy to the best, and if you see this movie, you will see what she can do!!!"
5,forgotten classic,"I bought this album back in 1989 and played it all summer, fully expecting the rest of the U.K. to buy it by the truckload.It lingered in the top 20 for a couple of months then vanished, which is a great shame as it ought to have propelled Then Jerico to massive success.The production on The Big Area is far better than First which was a bit tinny and one dimensional, no such problems here. Standout tracks include Where You Lie, What Does It Take, Sugar Box, Helpless and the title track, the only fly in the ointment being Under Fire which just doesn't do it for me. Extremely powerful and great driving music, from a band whos arrangements and sound were always fresh and different from the rest of the pop/rock bands from this era. Always hugely underrated, do the boys a favour by buying this album, it's a belter."
4,Great book for you,"I just got done reading the book 'That Summer'. This book is about a teenage girl named Haven. She goes through many good times and upsetting times. This book is a very gook book to read if you like to read teen issues. I would like to recomend this book to girls, because the main character is a girl. Many of the things that Haven goes through girs would be able to relate to, and the boys would probably think that it is boring. If you have an older sister that you fight with a lot, but deep down inside you know that you love her, this would be a perfect book for you. Haven and her sister fight quite a bit, but when it comes down to the times when they need each other the most,they're there for each other. If you're looking for a good book take my advice and read 'That Summer'."
2,That Summer,"The book was kind of dirty and the pages were bigger in width then the cover. Other than that, the book itself was a good book."
3,Okay,I'm not gonna say I didn't like it because it was an enjoyable read but not much going on. From pretty much the start you know what happens and it pretty much just follows Haven's life. I've read many of Dessen's books and she can write alot better than she did in this book!
4,the big blow,in the town of lakeview haven mcphail's family has many problems.her dad is getting married to the local weather woman and her sister is getting married also in the same summer.her best friend casie comes back from camp as a lovesick puppy.and haven is almost 6'0 ft tall!then her sister's exboyfriend sumner lee shows up and haven feel the weight of everything is lifted when she's with him.but then haven finds out why ashley dumped sumner.when the secret is lifted the family is put together in a new and understanding way.
4,Great book!,Loved it! Good family values. Really teaches the importance of family and explains the difficulties of life changing experiences. Just wish there was a sequel lol
4,Loved That Summer by Sarah Dessen!,"It did not have a lot going on or a big plot, which was different and I enjoyed that. Many teens can relate to the storyline, making it seem even better."
2,That Summer,"As much as I adore Sarah Dessen, her first book is not that memorable a read. There's nothing about it that really sticks out. I don't care about the characters, the plot, anything, and that's a bad characteristic for a story to possess. A book is meant to grab and enthrall its readers, and this one fails at this vital task. I understand that Haven, the main character, is in a state of tumult in her life, but the urgency is never really communicated in the writing. There's so much pointless description and deadened conversation, none of it seems quite real. I suppose a younger teen who is just getting used to growing up might enjoy this book, but for teens 15+, I'd pick another Dessen novel.Rating: 2/5"
3,Hopeful!,"Sarah Dessen's debut novel, ""That Summer"", isn't her best achievement but it shows true hope and promise of her rising YA author stardom.However, it is a coming of age story I think a lot of people, young adult and older(like, say 34) could relate to. At some point in our lives we all have similar experiences to the main character, Haven. She is 15, feels awkward in her own skin, and with divorced parents, an older sister who is getting married, and a best friend who's fallen in love. After reminiscing about a summer trip, she bumps into her sister's ex, Sumner.Not only is he not who Haven thinks he is, but she's not the same person by the time her sister's big day arrives.I think it's best to read this before her other novels because if you go to this after reading, ""dreamland"", you will be sorely disappointed.I didn't do this, and I loved all her other books much more immensely. Her writing gets better with each book.This was a very green Dessen, but very hopeful."
2,Not Worthy of 5 Stars,"I've read way too many books like this: ""I'm a teenager who is way too busy pining over my past when everyting was perfect to accept that everything has to change. I can't fit in. I'm not beautiful like my sister. My mother is miserable because daddy left our family for a gorgeous local celebrity."" The only thing that made this book okay was Haven's since of humor. Honestly??? I thought that the character should grow up, make use of her long legs, get a different job, find new friends, and accept that her life can't stay the same. However, I will recommend ""Someone Like You,"" which was in fact quite wonderfully written, if a little boring at times."
3,Nice Summer read!,"Super quick read .... Very sweet book! As a Dessen fan, this was not my favorites but true to her writing, it's very descriptive and colorfully written. I loved Haven' s character.What I loved:1. The sisterly bond between Haven and Ashley.2. Haven persona & wanting to ""fix"" all the wrongs (ie, caring for her mom, her feelings)3. Hitting the costumer with a shoe, LOL! Seriously ... Most of us have probably thought about that at least once ;)What I did not love:1. The dad leaving mom for a younger model ..... Not cool. That whole wedding/relationship/pregnancy just screamed unfair.2. The ex ... Sumner. For real? He let me down. I was actually Team Sumner until ...... The last chapters!It's a pretty predictable YA read ... Enjoyable, but a bit foreseeable."
2,Not my cup of tea,All of Sarah Dessen's books are amazing except this one. It was really boring. I was expecting some sort of romance like in the other Sarah Dessen books but it never showed up. The only interaction with a guy was Summer which went nowhere. I was expecting her sister to either dump her boring fiancee or get back together with Summer neither of which happened. The whole story was about Haven figuring out that other people are tall like her thats it.
2,An okay read.,"To be completely frank. I expected so much from this book only to be disappointed. I expected a book with more depth and a better plot. Okay, so there wasn't much of a plot. I've read other books that were equally plotless but this one I didn't like much at all. It lacked everything I wanted in a contemporary, young adult book. And seriously. I just feel bad about it. After the 100th page I started feeling like the story, or an inkling of it was going down hill from there.This book is pretty much written for way younger readers below 14 years of age. And I'm hoping whoever read this below that age group were able to understand whatever morale Dessen has written it to give out.That Summer is Sarah Dessen's debut novel and I'm pretty sure she has gotten better over the years. Since everyone loves her books. I'm going to go ahead and pick up her latest book and have at it. In hopes that her books have more depth and a lot more fluff!"
2,um..ok?,"The title basically sums up what i feel about this book. Sarah Dessen is definately one of my favorite authors EVER... i was actually going to apply to the u of north caolina, chapel hill just because she teaches there but, i didnt.Back to the book tho... it was a def a let down. I think so much more could have been done with this storyline but it sounded like a typical teen angst story and i was extremely disappointed when the book ended... i didnt realize there was no real substance to this story or else i wouldn't have read it. I love her other stories, like Dreamland and The Truth About Forever... those r books that are truly amazing"
5,A lot Like Me: That Summer,"I recently read ""That Summer"" and I loved it. This book reminded me of the past two years in my life. My parents divoriced and everything in my life sucked. I felt a lot like Haven, confused, scared and out-of-place. This book made me realize that sometimes you have to put the past behind you and move on. Even if it means letting go of something you love so much, you just have to learn to give it up. Just like Haven there always comes a time when we just want to runaway, but we can't. We have to face our fears with open arms. Dessen did an excellent job! I sure hope to enjoy others by her as well. Highly recommended for all ages!"
1,Leave this one on the Shelf!!!,"I am a fan of Sarah Dessen, so of course i did not hesitate to read That Summer. I am sorry to say that it was a great let down and not just because Sarah Dessen is a usually a wonderful author, because it was lacking in everything that makes a good book. For one thing, there was no plot. At first it seemed like you were being kept in suspence of what would happen next, but nothing DID happen. It was as if the last few chapters were not published with this book. If you are considering buying and/or reading this book, I advise you not to. Instead, read one of Sarah Dessen's other wonderful books such as Someone Like You or This Lullaby."
4,Pretty good.,"I read this a while ago, and I read it after 'Someone Like You' and I suppose I was expecting it to be just as good, but I didn't find it as exciting, and enjoyable. But it's still pretty good, but I suppose I just had high expectations."
5,That Summer,"This book is good, yet interesting. It is not as much of a dramatic story as a narrative of the way something happened. However, it is still a book that I would recommend to anyone looking for a book to read!"
2,zzzzz...,"This book was most definately her worst. It's boring and I'm not really sure what the point was besides that being tall sucks. I was bored at many times and was disapointed by the lack of a love story that Dessen is known so well for. The character Sumner reminded me of Dexter from another Dessen book This Lullaby. He was the only good thing about this book, but he was too old to become a love intrest of Haven the main character. All of Dessen's other books however are excellent so don't judge her work on this specific book, because it was the black sheep."
2,Hm...a little disappointing,"though i am a fan of dessen, this book really disappointed me. i read this right after 'someone like you' and it doesn't even compare. in this book, haven's character is poorly developed. you never really get to know anything about her besides that she gets angry at the world. dessen's usual strong maincharacters did not appear in this book as we learn that haven acts as a doormat for most of her life, going along with things she doesn't believe in without a peep. when i read other people's 5 star reviews of the book i am definetly surprised and wonder whether they were fully conscience while reading."
5,Essential for the holidays,"I just tried the marbled pumpkin cheesecake at a Halloween party and it was the best tasting mix between pumpkin pie and cheesecake I'd ever had! This book has it all, from simple roasted turkeys to delicious squash casseroles. I can't wait to try more this season!"
3,could take it or leave it,"no pictures, okay recipes, probably not something I would purchase again had I known the details of the book."
5,Eric Idle has done it again!,"Allright, I have just recentely got into Monty Python and I am totally hooked! He is my favorite and when I heard this CD was out and ran to buy it. I mean this was the first (most likely not the last! ) Monty Python CD that I have bought. I love how it is done live and you kind of get the feeling that you are actually there! This CD has the words in it so you can sing along, but it doesn't have the words to all of them...... It has some classic favs like the Money Song, Every Sperm is Scared, I like Chinese, and the infamouse Lumberjack Song. The Lumberjack Song was a spontaneous encore which they had rehearsed for three days. He was like ""I never wanted to be a musician.....I wanted to be a Lumberjack!"" and then everyone started cheering and it made me smile! So if you are a Monty Python fan, this is the CD for you! So go buy it you little buggers!"
3,"Not as bad as I expected, but ultimately kind of pointless","We already have the compilation Monty Python Sings, as well as (most/all? who knows at the time you read this) of the original albums still easily available on CD. Not to mention various other Monty Python compilations (the best of which being The Final Ripoff...if only...) Anyway, upon release, this felt like a quick cash in, a way for Idle to remind people he's still alive and that he (co)wrote much of this material and that he's still capably funny...And that's not really any less the way I feel after hearing it. But I will say that he tackles this material with aplomb and the spoken setups are interesting and/or funny in parts. In other words, it's a souvenir and a cash in, but not an embarrassment. For the completists among us--and there are many (raises hand)--this will be one more Python related product needed on the shelf. But for the rest of you, I'd say there are other places better to start..."
4,Fun toy...child can sit in it!,Lots of fun for 2-6 yr old child! My child loved it. It is large and they actually sit in it and pretend to fly! Great toy for any fan of Rescue Heroes or just a fan of helicopters who wants to pretend they are really flying in one.
1,I Agree,"I agree with the previous review. I too thought this was a helicopter for the figurines. It is a fine toy that my son would enjoy, but the description could be much clearer. No one wants to bring home a new toy and be disappointed."
3,low quality,"The complete layout of the case is excellent in design. Every hardware review I've read gives excellent reviews for the design. They all fail to mention, however, that the paint job on the case is horrific (splotchy and flat), and the plexi used in the side panel is so brittle that the first one I received had shattered in shipment. For the price paid for this case, the paint job should be glossy and smooth (look at coolermaster cases), and I'd expect the side panel to take a little bit of movement."
2,Taste good but hasn't helped with conception...,"I gave this product only 2 stars because it has done about half of what I had hoped it would accomplish. Two stars because it tastes good... As far as aiding in fertility, I can't write a rave review about it because I have been drinking this tea for a while now and have not conceived (this is paired with tracking ovulation as well). I figured it would be a helpful supplement, but no such luck. So, if you like tea, buy it. If you are trying to get pregnant, I wouldn't waste your money on this product."
5,No Clots!,"I just started taking this product yesterday on CD1. This is my 32nd cycle trying to conceive. I decided to go the natural route because infertility treatments are expensive and hard on the body. My cycles are typically regular (28-32) with some really short ones here and there, but my main issue is that I only ovulate about half of the time on my own. I also never get EWCM. What I have noticed so far, just in two days, is that my typical quarter sized blood clots are gone! My cramps, which I usually have to take 2 ibuprofen and 2 tylenol simultaneously, have lessened and I am not even on meds right now. I'm keeping everything crossed that we will successfully get pregnant this month. It has been a LONG road. If not, at the very least, I know this tea is good for me. It tastes pretty good too."
5,It Works!!!,This tea really works. I'm convinced it helped me to conceive a number of times in my mid to late 30s! I'm a believer.
1,is it safe?,So I've had this tea for over a month..I'm just nervous drinking it bc everything on google says to see an herbal specialist before taking any herbs. What do you guys think??
1,Didn't work at all,"Drank this for 2 months with no success. Last month I drank it and had absolutely ZERO CM. Bone dry, not even a drop. It may work for others but it was a major disappointment for me. I'm giving up after two months because of the lack of CM production (which is something it's supposed to help with) so I figure it's not a useful product. So now I have a second package that I' m not using.....total waste of money."
4,"Excited! Great taste, we'll see about the results.","I just got my package of FertiliTea today, and I'm having a cup as I type. The tea is light in color and has a subtle, herb-like flavor with a hint of mint. I am having it with a bit of sugar and it is quite delicious! Right now, I'm on day 3 of an irregular cycle, and on my first cup of tea. I'm excited about the great reviews but I'm not going to get my hopes up because I have yet to experience its effects myself. With the first cup though, it does bring about a bit of an odd feeling... or maybe its just me. Anyhoo, I'll give it about a week or so and I'll be back with an updated review, rating, and hopefully a success story of my own. Cheers!"
4,Effective but bland & boring,"I've been drinking this tea for about 6 weeks now. It seems to be working -- I think it is what finally jump-started my cycle after I stopped using birth control pills over 6 months ago. That alone is enough to make me glad I tried this!I only gave it 4 stars because it does get boring to keep drinking it. It's really bland, without much of a peppermint taste at all. I let it steep a long time (8+ minutes) and have even started adding some organic licorice tea to sweeten it/add some flavor. (I add licorice b/c it's my favorite. Including a sachet of peppermint tea would enhance the flavor, too.)I've not experienced any bad side effects and will continue drinking it for a while. I think that each bag of tea probably lasts 3 months. (I'm still on my first bag after 6 weeks.)The company (Fairhaven) answers questions if you email them, which is a bonus in my opinion."
5,IT WORKS,"Yes, it works. I tried for 7 months to get pregnant. This last month I tried FertiliTea, (that is the only thing I did differently). I drank it religiously 2 times a day from the first day of my period until about Cycle Day 20. Then I decided to stop. On Cycle Day 28 I had the strongest ovulation ever... 16 Days past ovulation I had a positive Pregnancy Test. I have a bunch of Tea leftover, so will give it to a friend who is trying to conceive."
2,Disgusting,"While I'm not debating the medicinal purposes, I would like to say that this tea is absolutely horrid to the taste bud."
5,it works & is natural,"Well ladies , I'm being totally honest. Do not give up hope ! I was very discouraged and was frustrated . I was irregular on my cycle due to just getting off birth control, so in June 2011 I stopped taking birth.control and had unprotected sex up untill September and ordered the bag of fertilitea and drank 2- 3 cups daily ( must make the time to be successful) and my cycle became much better I ovulated and had more cm after a month or so and now I'm pregnant very excited! My due date is September 8 th ! Good luck mommas :) this does.help regulate cycles which leads to ovulaton = babies ! Yay"
4,Tastes great!,"I really like this product. I've only been using it a week, therefore don't see a ton of results, however, I can't believe that it actually tastes good. If you like tea, you'll enjoy the minty taste. Those TTC, you know that you'll try just about anything! For this price, I figured, why not? Note: it does not come in tea bags. You will need a tea ball. So far I have been straining mine and it is a little of a pain. I plan to get the ball this week."
4,Here's Hoping!,"So I just received my FertiliTea today, and had my first cup...minty smell, slight mint taste, overall good. Excited to see what happens in the coming weeks/months. It's getting four stars...until I get my BFP that is! And ""The Baby Dust"" is such a sweet touch to add! Will let you know how things turn out!"
5,Worked for me!,"I got pregnant after drinking this tea for 3 months. I'll never know if the tea was helpful or not but now that I'm close to delivery I'm glad I tried it. The taste is sort of minty, not bad tasting at all. I drank it every morning and now I have a baby boy arriving in a few weeks."
1,This is NOT for those who have a regular cycle!!! I found out the hard way.,"I did not know this prior to purchase. I drank only a cup a day for about a week hoping to ""strengthen"" my system to only send it completely out of whack. I am a regular 28-29 day gal who had no signs of ""O"" while drinking the tea and then started spotting for several days 18 days into my cycle. I have never spotted before and I am not pregnant. I think it might be a great product for those who are irregular, but not for me. I guess the ole saying if it ain't broke don't fix it. I was only trying to BOOST my chances. Now, I sit here wondering when a real cycle is going to begin. Good Luck to all!!"
1,Upset!,"I started drinking the tea on the first day of my period (26 day norm). On the day 16th of the cycle I got heavy bleeding, that is still going on, looking like a miscarriage.I should have listened to the reviews' warnings."
2,Flavor wasn't bad....,"I was a bit hestiant to try this product because I read other reviews on how the taste was not great. I am not a big tea drinker, but I have to admit that the taste was the least of my problems. I got my period a week before I was supposed to start and the only thing I could think of that would cause it was the tea, I never had my period start a week before a few days yes but not a whole week. After that I never went back to the tea, I still take my Fertiaid."
2,Didnt work for me,I didnt really lik it didnt do any thing for me it made me nauseous. so i stopped taking it.. Even tho it didnt work for me it may work for other woman it may depend on person to person
3,Something New to try,"Well I decided to try this, drink 2cups a day for a month & I didn't notice any changes I don't know if I was drinking it right way or what, reason to taking this wanted to see if it will help me regulate my period or see if it made me a little fertile but didn't notice anything, the taste was alright kinda mint and wax taste, it is a lil messy but good.."
3,is okay,"it is okay my wife loves to drink this, hasn't worked though, kind of expensive for what you get, bought with vitex"
5,Good Tea,"Fertilitea is great, but it might give you nausea. That is because it has herbs that can cause that side effect, but it did not really bother me that much. I felt it was working when I had that side effect, plus it takes good too. Anyone trying to get pregnant should try this tea."
5,This tea is great,"I ordered this tea and have been taking it for two week. The taste is great and I got pregnant right away. I recomend it to everyone, who is trying to have a baby. Thanks FertiliTea."
4,Helped with cycle,"This really did help bring my cycle closer to 28 days. It used to be random from 35-65 days. I quit drinking the tea after a few months because I live in TX and drinking hot tea twice a day just during spring can be intolerable. I may start up again now that the weather is cooler.The tea is very tasty, relaxing, and refreshing. It actually got me started on drinking more herbal and loose leaf teas.My only qualms with the tea is that it wouldn't mix well in the bag. Not knowing if settling occurred made me worry that the portion I was scooping out may not have been the proper ratio of the ingredients. Also I would have liked to have known if it was possible to make the tea ahead of time, let it cool, and then drink...or if had to be drank immediately (which was how I was treating it)"
4,Great Taste,"I only just bought this, but wanted to comment on the taste. I think its very good. It tastes like a typical peppermint tea that you would drink for say an upset stomach. I add half of one packet of natural sweetener and its a lovely drink for before bed. I will update my review when/if I have fertility success with it! Just wanted to put anyone's mind at ease concerning if they would even be able to get it down!"
2,I hope it did but it did not!,I guess it works on some people only. I have not have my period for 6 months and so i didn't want to go gt a check up yet because its to expensive with no medicaid so i decided to try this but it does not work for me.
1,Green Tea in Large quantities binds with folic acid,"I have not purchased this product however with my last pregnancy I remebered about not suppose to drink green tea. Also I know your suppose to take prenatal vitamins while trying to get pregnant because of the folic acid in them. I copied and pasted this info from a baby website. Just as a precaution.""....However, drinking an extremely large amount of green tea can prevent you from absorbing folic acid properly. Folic acid is an important nutrient, particularly during the first 12 weeks of your pregnancy. One small study suggests that babies can develop neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, if their mums drink lots of green tea around the time of conception"""
3,will be moving on,"I am in the process of TTC right now. Thought i would give the tea a try during our ""break"" month and honestly hoping miracles. The taste is ok. I had to gulp it down cold because I did not want to keep sipping on it slowly. I had an LH surge 2 days earlier than usual but ovulation still took place at the same time. We did not succeed with our TTC efforts so will be moving on to some intense interventions with our RE. I admit that I used this tea only for a month but did not notice any difference at all. I have normal cycles and that may be the reason. I wish I had given it a try earlier but do not wish to beat around the bush anymore. Good luck to all those who are TTC as well. Hopefully this tea will do wonders for at least some of you ladies."
5,Excellent product!,"This product is fantastic. Order arrived promptly. When I first saw and tasted the tea, I was very pleased with the quality and the taste. This is a tea that I would drink solely for taste. And, I've paid much more for smaller quantities of loose tea like this. The taste is light and refreshing and very soothing. Which is great when you are stressed about trying to become pregnant.Now - I don't want to get anyone's hopes up or anything because I know that for some who are trying to conceive it is easy to get really hopefully and then get disappointed, but....After one month of drinking this tea I have a positive on a pregnancy test!I still have to go to the doctor next week to confirm everything and to check on everything - but at this stage in the game I'm pretty darn sure I'm pregnant. I can't say that it is solely on the tea, but then again we'd been trying for months and only after one month of drinking the tea have we gotten the results we're looking for."
5,ez-way to make this tea,"I have only been using this tea for 2 weeks so don't actually know if it works. However, the most effective way to make it is this.... You will need to go to Bed Bath & Beyond and purchase a tea ball (about $3.00) and a jumbo stoneware coffee mug (about 5in diameter wide) The one I have is a brown Sango brand.Pour 2 cups water into mug, then place on stovetop on low heat. Bring to boil, then insert tea ball with the 2 teaspoons of loose tea inside. Boil for about a minute, then turn off heat and let steep for 5 minutes. This will give you 2 servings and maximum benefits from the ingredients. Do NOT try and use a regular sized mug, though.I clean my teaball by soaking it in vinegar every 4 days. The taste of this tea is pleasant enough. I do not add anything to it.After trying various ways of making this tea, I've found this is the best and less hassle. Hope it helps. Best wishes TTC!!"
2,"Hey, it does include some must-haves!","A disappointing comeback attempt recorded in Baltimore (which partly explains CTS's undue popularity in that city), there are a LOT of lemons on this album. However, there are also some winning inclusions that are must-haves for fans of CTS's promising debut album (which see).Somewhat out of focus, they vary between sounding like M's ""Pop Music"" on ""Techi Generation"" (which I loved) to John Lennon on ""Flying"". All over the place, it's far more of a desperate attempt at commercial success than the enthusiastic creativity of that fine debut. When CTS is best, they sound like the Beatles' ""Walrus""?4 of 15 tracks is my yield, which really I'm happy with. Definitely recommend buying this album and the debut together, which should give you 15 tracks (out of 28!) of highly original material that will make you the envy of all your friends, especially if you live in Baltimore!"
5,Great Fit!,"I recieved this bar for My Nissan Frontier for Christmas and I am very happy with it. The bar is very well made and installation was a breeze, took me a total of 15 minutes to install it on my truck. Bar looks great installed and the light mounting brackets fit my Hella 500's perfectly."
2,"Why, Warner Brothers, WHY???","I find it very hard to believe that Warner Brothers does not know what most people REALLY want!! - ALL the Rankin/Bass specials W/B owns together in one nice neat box set!! Instead they trickle them out here and there, box set after box set, just slightly altering the titles and wasting space with non-Rankin/Bass specials that simply stink! Why would you release a set where 85% of the contents are made by one company, meanwhile you own the rights to unreleased specials by that same company, but instead tack on tacky new ones that 99% of the buyers have no interest in! Silly. Stupid. Dumb. Rude."
3,Disappointing,"Two years after the color-corrected, remastered ""Grinch"" was released on DVD, this collection still employs the old, dull, yellowish Grinch version. Come on!"
5,to high a price.,"the land before time music is the best, at times it made me cry.but i have not got the cd let because the person who is selling the cd on this site has a big INSAINE price $57.00.i'll pay $10, $15, even $20 but 57 no way!plese lower the price?i don't think people will buy the cd with that price!"
4,Terribly Sad Movie,"I would have rated this soundtrack higher, but the song ""Whispering Winds"" makes me cry too much every time I hear it. The Land Before Time is right up there with Bambi as far as ""bad mommy"" scenes go. Other than that, it is phenomenal, especially The Great Migration, which is the opening tune."
3,"Very beautiful score, but it lacks songs","I think this movie would have been better as a musical. Not kid songs, but nice ones like ""When We Hold On Together"", you know? Buy this CD if you want a CD to listen to to relax or fall asleep, not to listen to a lot of songs, because there aren't any!"
1,A big disappointment!,"The only reason I bought this CD was because the reviews were just great about it. I'm sorry I spent [money] on it also. Oh, well just one of those things, you live and learn."
3,Full Version will be released to PPV end of year!!!,"FYI - The DVD does have all the GOOD stuff taken out and it does make all the difference in the movie. However, the full version with all scenes is supposed to be released to Pay-Per-View sometime around the end of the year (from what I hear) ;). Since I have seen the full version I can tell you it would be worth it to give the DVD to your mom and watch the PPV when it comes out yourself. That version will restore your faith in the genre. :-)"
1,Don't Buy this Censored DVD,"The people who put this on DVD have chosen to put out this heavily censored version with virtually all the good nude/sex scenes removed... why? Absolutely no clue... when softcore studios do this it is absouletly unexplainable. What fools..!Don't waste your money, it's completely worhtless in every way."
1,Not even worth a rental,"Due to my high threshhold for pain (or love for all things low brow), I am able to endure, if not, enjoy many movies that most people would use as a coaster or as a table leg extension. However, I think I just found a movie that I would use as a frisbee. Treasure Hunt has to be one of the dumbest things I've ever watched. Let's be honest, when you watch a sexy 'B'-flick, you expect certain things: cheesy humor, cheesy acting, cheesy sets, and skin. I'm still waiting for any of these elements to show up in this movie. I couldn't call this movie a B-flick because that would be insulting the B-flick genre. That's how bad this movie is. Listen to the other reviewers, don't bother with this turkey."
3,Squeeze the last of the juice out!,"This is an OK album. It just seems to me they were just trying to squeeze more money out using stuff from the old album. Remixes, live performances and that's it. Buy it for your collection. There isn't much else that you will get out of it though... Rather get the next one. You gotta hand it to this boyz though, they can sing. I bought this in my high school days. It just brings back so many memories..."
4,Smooth harmony,"Phat beats underlyin my tone, baby waste not time or leave me the hell alone. These fellas can sing!"
1,Not Satisfied With This Product,The McKenzie Lumbar Roll is not designed well. When I fit it over the back of my chair the roll doesn't stay where I position it. It flops down. So every time I sit back I have to adjust it. I would not recommend this product.
1,Hurting my back,"This item was recommanded by my physyotherapist. I couldn t use it, i got much more pain with it than without. In addition , this cushion doesn' stay at the right level of you back.I had to purchase another one : lumbar back cushion from Tempur. Nothing to compare, since i got immediate relief,now i can sit at work without pain for long penriod of time."
2,disappointed,the original McKenzie super roll it would not work well in my chair at work even with the strap. I had it for one day. I HAVE FOUND OUT YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS SO I JUST LOST THE MONEY I SPENT ON IT VERY DISAPPOINTED if I had know you could not return it I would not have ordered it.
2,Disappointed,"I found two major problems with the cushion. First, the cushion does not stay in place on my chair (I have a Herman Miller Aeron) no matter how tight I pull the strap. So, I have to constantly readjust the cushion every time I sit down or fidget in my chair. The cushion is also coated in a fleece-like material and makes my back feel very hot as the day goes on. Its been very hard for me to make it through a full day without wanting to remove the cushion. Further, because of the heat, I think I end up fidgeting more than normal. The end result is that rather than helping, I think the cushion has actually made my back hurt more than normal! Very disappointing."
4,Very Very helpful,"Love this product. Use one in the car and in my office chair. I would highly recommend to anyone having to sit for long periods of time who feels even slight discomfort in the lower back. Alleviates pressure and helps you sit up straighter all day. A bit weird to get used to at first, but eventually it becomes second nature to adjust when you sit. cut off the strap its useless unless you want to look ridiculous strapping it to your body. too much up and down to warrant. One downside is that like all pillows they wear out. About every 7-8 months you can start to tell a difference in the consistency. Nevertheless, I continue to buy it. Better to spend [...] bucks once a year than other expensive remedies for an aching lower back."
5,Glad I chose it,"I just got mine today and I'm very pleased. Very good, adjustable support. I'm using it now on my computer chair, which I didn't think would work, because the chair is a two piece (seat and backrest), and I can't wait to try it in my car, which is the main reason I purchased it."
5,Back relief,"This was great, after therapy it gave my back a good feeling and lots of support. Price was the best I found."
1,Hurts my back more than helps,My physical therapist recommended me order this product. I used it at work because I sit behind a desk all day. I found that it hurts my back more than it helps. I stopped using it after trying it for 3 weeks. My back feels better.
1,Super Lumbar Roll,"After my recent back surgery, I ordered this at the recommendation of my Physical Therapist. (It was 3x as expensive as he thought at the outset.) I am unable to use it because it feels like a big lump and causes me more pain. I'll try it at work on that particular desk chair when I'm able to return, but if the pain is no better the lumbar roll will need to be sent back. Any suggestions from other users?"
5,The Original McKenzie Super Roll Lumbar Roll,"Works so much better than a cushion, a pillow, or a rolled-up towel. I am going to get a second one for the office."
4,Quite Firm,"May be a bit too firm. Works well on my office chair, but is too long to fit in the bucket seat in my car."
5,Great product,"I used to have one like these a few years ago, but when I traded in my old car I forgot to take it off the seat. So I didn't use this product for a few years. But I got back pain easily. So I decided to get a new one. This product is just great. It relieves back pain due to prolonged sitting like when you drive for hours. I highly recommend it to anyone."
2,Uncomfortable piece of garbage,I don't know who finds these things comfortable. This thing just gets in the way whenever I sit in my wife's car.
4,Great for long car trips,"Works great for long car trips. Much less neck, arm and lower back fatigue. Not too thick, contoured on the edges. Is easily moved or removed for different drivers."
1,Try before you Buy! Caveat Emptor,"I tried this product for about one minute and it was totally inappropriate for my back--way too much curvature--and when I tried to return it I was told that because I ""tried"" it, it could not be returned--my advice, do not buy this product online because you cannot return it--my local Goodwill happily accepted it."
1,Made my back feel worse!,"I have a friend who swears by this product, so I bought one. I have chronic back pain, and am always interested in something that will help. However, this actually made my back hurt more! I ended up giving it away. It is very hard...no give to it at all. I have another, bigger, lumbar support made out of a memory foam that works much better for me."
4,Mckenzie Super roll,"Great product for my lower back pain. Great price, a lot less than I would have paid at a local back store. Quick delivery"
2,Disapointed with item size...,This item was surprisingly small and did not fit either of my cars (which is the main reason I bought it). It may work for some types of office chairs - but only ones with full backs. My office uses two piece chairs and so this was useless there as well.But it is well made and seems to be of high quality. Just not as useful as I thought it would be.
3,It's Okay,I got the roll for my husband to help with his posture in the car. He likes the roll but wishes it was more firm to provide him with the back support he needs.
5,Low to moderate support,My husband and I both use this lumbar pillow. We use it in the car or for chairs where there is already a little bit of support. High quality.
1,awful product,"Cannot recommend this, very hard, and I used it in the car, very hard, so it hurt. Cannot recommend this at all. Also, please note that you cannot return this product once removed from the plastic bag, but this is not made evident until if ou try to return it. Cannot recommend this product at all."
4,McKenzie Super Roll,"I use one for long trips and at the computer. It provides significant reduction of my mid-back pain, both relief and prevention."
2,Better than the round one,"Works OK once you get it adjusted. This is the size most people need. But the elastic strap and the velcro are a pain in the behind. For my purposes a sewn on, adjustable strap with a clip would be much better."
2,Ronald Reagan,I was disappointed in this book. It was too short for the massive subject material about Reagan.
5,Must have,This is a great book for anyone interested in mushrooms. It entails ancient and ritualistic use of Psilocybin mushrooms as well as the Amantia species all the way up to the 90s. The book also breaks down the basic knowlege you must know if you intend to have any voice on mushrooms in general. This was the first book I ever got on mushrooms. I find some of the 90s information inaccurate based on ignorance but regardless you must have this book.
1,cheap!,"We have been playing for 5 years and our teacher always says, ""get the best strings you can afford"", recommending the Dominant brand. Because of the other ratings about these D'Addarios, I purchased them. We were very disappointed. Our teacher, without knowing I'd put new strings on, quickly said we really needed new strings. I will pay the price and stick with Dominants."
2,Be aware,"This item came before delivery date BUT it was not lexmark ink, as stated in the description. I had read before I ordered that the cartridges might not align properly OR might be empty. Well, I had to send the black ink back because it would not align with my printer after numerous attempts of retrying so it did not print correctly. The colored ink was and still is just fine. Buyers be aware. I was offered a refund for one cartridge without a problem."
1,Deceptive Advertisement,The picture that was displayed in the advertisement gave you the impression you were buying a Lexmark brand not a Knock off . This was not a offical Lexmark product.
1,Printer would NOT accept these cartridges,"I was kind of surprised when I got these without an accompanying box. However, they had Lexmark on the foil and on the black cartridge. When I placed them in my printer, it kept giving me an error stating it was the incorrect cartridge.They look identical to the ones I pulled out. Very frustrating, because I needed to print today and my others are depleted.I just submitted for a refund (because I could not check replacement). Hopefully, I will be able to get my money back.Update: 9/13/2011 - received refund quickly from Amazon."
2,Did it work?,The color cartridge does not fit my printer which has always used a #33 cartridge. I must return it. The black cartridge fits and works just fine.
2,Lexmark #32/#33 Twin Pack Ink Cartridges,The #32 black ink cartridge fits and works properly in my printer. The #33 color ink cartridge would not line up properly in my printer. My printer kept rejecting it with an error message that it was an incorrect cartridge. It looked identical to the cartridge I replaced. At the time I needed a color cartridge immediately so I went to a local store and bought one. It worked perfectly.
4,VERY GOOD AND VERY EXPENSIVE,"I have used this product several times. No problems ever. Works well and reliable. However like all printers and ink regardless of brand,you can buy a model printer dirt cheap but are way overcharged for the ink refills.It is the old Poloroid camera trick. Buy the camera for $50 and spend $1 a instant print.Soon you spent $300 on film.Some bargain price for camera OR printer huh? As far as printer and ink goes, I can recomend Lexmark."
4,Lexmark Printer Ink refills 32 & 33,I received my first box of refills and they were excellent....far better price that Target or Wal-Mart!! The next refill didn't work but Amazon sent a replacement overnight and it worked perfectly!! Only thing I didn't know was that I had to return the damaged refill and I had mistakenly thrown it away!! Be Aware!!
5,Lexmark #32/#33 Twin Pack Ink Cartridges,Buyiing from Amazon has saved so much money on this product. Purchasing in a local store would have been 1 1/2 times the price.
1,Lemark printer cartridges,"Had to return the cartridges. They did not fit - received an error message on the printer itself. Returned for refund and replaced with retail purchase. Item was not received in Lexmark package as profiled on product description. But that is exactly what I did end up buying (i.e., in that packaging from retail store). Will not use online purchase again to avoid the inconvenience of delay and time to return for credit."
3,50-50,"The price is right; the Black cartridge works fine; however, for last few days the printer has been sending signal that ""Color Cartridge Low"" ... so the jury is out on this item.Perhaps the printer signal is incorrect (never has been before) and color cartridge will last longer than, at most, 5 print jobs which printed in ""light"" ink--OR defective color cartridge was sent.We'll see how it goes (sigh)."
5,Excellent!,"I'm not one to purchase items online often, so at first I was skeptic about buying this product. In the end,it turned out to be a great deal. Not only is it a lot cheaper than what Staples and WalMart advertise, you also receive an additional packet of the black ink, so instead of getting 2 cartridges, you get 3. Definitely worth buying, I highly recommend it, I am definitely buying my computer ink from this provider again."
5,Lexmark ink cartridges,"This product is of good quality and is guaranteed to give excellent results.The black ink lasts for an appreciable length of time.There is just one small concern about the colored ink and that is,the length of time it lasts.The color does not seem to last. The yield from the color is not half as long as the black."
1,"I WON""T BUY IT!!",It would help A LOT if you had song titles listed here. Not many people are going to buy a cd when they don't know what songs are on it.
4,Jody..is larger than life..,"A great Cd..i still have this as a cassette...ahh..brings back memories. Jody was the bomb in those days. She still is..get this you won't be disappointed...""listen up""...!"
1,Very Uncomfortable Adidas,"This pair of shoes is one of the most uncomforable shoes Ive worn. I managed to cut my heel after wearing it for just 2 hours. Adidas is normally comfortable, but this is really cheap. 1 out of 10 !!! Very Poor"
2,Something Important Missing,"The major problem with this Korean phrase book, is that it does not show any accent marks for the words it lists. Seeing the pronunciation is not helpful at all, if the reader does now know which syllable(s) to accent. Otherwise it seems to be a good book."
5,Great!,"This CD is great and features the late Notorious B.I.G.'s first song, ""Party and Bullshit"". This is a CD everyone who collects CDs should have."
1,Who's the man,Dissapointed that none of the music I heard in the movie wasn't on the this tape. And that was the only reason I purhased it.
3,Middle-Class Thriller,"This thriller is unfortunately nothing more than middle-class. The story is very good and the viewers surely expect more than they can see then ! Some scenes turn out to be very exicting but this doesn't save this movie to become a little disappointing at all. Donna Mills fans (like me) will enjoy it, but she deserves better !"
3,Economics essay,"This is an economics essay, so reality is drastically simplified. Summary:1. Nations are larger when the environment is less peaceful.2. Nations are larger when a dictator's goal is to increase his power.This book will not satisfy people interested in history, geography, or social or military issues."
