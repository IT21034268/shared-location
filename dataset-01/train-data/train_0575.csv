4,Lorena McCourtney does it again,"After enjoying Ms McCourtney's first book (Invisible), I was looking forward to reading the second in the Ivy Malone series and I was not disappointed - Ms McCourtney shows that, being gray-haired does not mean that one's life has seen it all. Now I look forward to reading Book 3."
5,A Delightful Tale,"I've read both Ivy Malone mysteries by Lorena McCourtney, both from Amazon's Kindle Store. The first (free) novel, ""Invisible,"" is based on a common experience of aging women, the sensation of becoming invisible while store clerks, police officers, and other people look at the important men and the beautiful young people who seem to fill the world. Ivy decides being invisible is an asset, if you want to solve a mystery!Invisible (Ivy Malone Mystery Series #1)""Invisible"" was her first adventure as an ""invisible"" detective, and ""In Plain Sight"" is her second, when invisibility does not seem quite as easy to assume. Both stories are well-written, with good, tight plots and interesting characters. While these novels are very much in the ""cozy mystery"" tradition, Ivy's original point of view adds both humour and philosophy. I'm hoping the third book is available soon."
5,Great read,I have read the whole set. Ivy presents as a sweet LOL(little old lady) I enjoyed how everything flowed so well. The way things twist together produces a great tale. I hope there are more books of Ivy super-sleuth.
5,In Plain Sight,"I really found these mysteries entertaining and exciting. I was dissapointed to see they were ""Christian Mysteries"" and sometimes had to jump over her annoying religious dialog, but the stories...the series, are worth it and interesting. Better than most and fun to have an older woman as the one that solves crimes and is independent. I do recommend them!"
4,Review of In Plain Sigt,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading the Ivy Malone mystery series. It was humorous, well written, and kept my attention. I appreciated the LOL references."
4,I'm now addicted,I love Ivy Malone - she's jind of like an American Miss Marple. A very sharp older lady who takes advantage of being invisible. The plots are intriguing and really draw the reader along. There is also a strong Christian message in these books.
4,Good Mystery,It made me want more. It was real good story. Making you want the next book to add another leg to journey.
4,Very fun read.,I've read all four books in this series and recommend all of them. I couldn't put them down. Very well written.
4,What a fun read!,I've read this four book series. They are all really fun to read. A LOL (little old lady) named Ivy Malone is always getting into trouble because of her curiosity. Murders seem to find her wherever she goes. She is a very spunky character with a good sense of humor. These books are easy quick reads and good to the end.
4,Gotta Love Ivy!,"I'm not crazy about religious people, so when Ivy says things like ""I feel sorry for people who don't have an eternity with the Lord to look forward to"", I must say it grates a bit. However, these mysteries are so good I can actually overlook that stuff because I can't wait to see what happens to Ivy next! Her nosy LOL (little old lady) gene gets her involved with some seriously bad people but it sure it fun watching her get out of trouble!"
3,a stretch,this story did not hold up to the first book in the series. Some of the characters and situations were a long stretch of the imagination.t
4,Good East Reading,"not easy to prodict but an easy reading book to pick up & put down anytime, follows on from book one would like to read whole series"
3,LOL Detective,"I rushed to purchase this book, ""In Plain Sight"" after reading the initial book ""Invisible..."" I felt a bit letdown with the overall story. It was too slow and the ending left me yawning. I am not as excited to purchase the 3rd book in the series. I'll wait for my local library to stock it."
3,"good story, but religious zealotry intrudes","The LOL sleuth has appeal; the plotting and the humor enhance the enjoyment of these mysteries. But in this, the second one in the series, the religious lectures and ""discussions"" with other characters on her faith in her Lord, get even more in the way of enjoying the stories. She needs to back off the proseletizing for me to continue reading."
2,In Plain sight,Book was Not as good as her first one in the series - lacks drama but ok reading for putting you asleep.
1,English Cozy Lite-- American Style,"In Plain Sight does not deserve even one star but I couldn't give it less and be allowed to write a review. This book is for the readers produced by American schools-- barely literate, easily amused by downhome antics of little old ladies (Southern, at that) and incapable of participating in good plot and good writing. In fact, this book is little more than the stuff peddled to ""Christian book store"" buyers who have no idea that they are being swindled by quick-and-easy effortless religious sentiments masquerading as real religion which takes effort and critical thinking. If this is ""your kind of book""-- these are very popular!--you will feel right at home. If it's not, you will feel disgusted and appalled by this series starring Ivy Malone, LOL detective."
3,Notes from an old pro,"A pleasingly old school acoustic jazz quartet is hampered only by the recording ambience, which has the clinical, slightly dead studio sound that used to hamper so many Japanese jazz recordings. It takes what could have been a pleasing throwback and renders it into mood music, something you might fall asleep to. There's a heavy reliance on Ellington tunes (including the title track's sweet tribute to the Duke) but the musical atmosphere is anything but Ellingtonian. Still, it's all quite pleasant and certainly worth hearing for Burrell's longtime fans. Surprisingly, the tracks Burrell sings on are quite enjoyable, as he has carefully chosen tunes that aren't overly familiar and that suit a man of, well, a certain age. I was particularly stunned by the lyrics of ""My Ship,"" which I have never heard before, and which Burrell delivers quite convincingly. It's the one track here that made me sit up and take notice."
1,Why didn't I just spend the five extra dollars for a decent capo?...,"The capo will not completely depress the strings... It will either leave your low E string half-way pressed and result in a buzzing noise, or your high E with a palm muted noise... Spend the extra five or 10 dollars and get yourself a quality clip-on capo that will last you."
4,Great Capo,"This is a great capo.I bought this hoping it would be decent quality, being much cheaper than most capos. It is great quality. Note it won't fit a curved neck well such as a strat, but for acoustic guitars like mine it works great. Also, it's not too tight, but nothing that can't be fixed poking a few holes in it.I also like how you can slide it during play, making it much easier than a clip on...overall great product I'd suggest it.UPDATE- One year later and I am still using this capo. For the cheap price, it was worth it. It holds down all my guitars well, I like that it slides as I said above, and it's durable, it works just as great today a year later as it did the day I got it. I don't think the other guy that wrote a review was very reasonable, it is a capo you snap on through the holes, not a clip on, so obviously it won't hold the strings as well, but it is also much more flexible, and frankly I like the look better"
4,Onmyoji II O.K.,"There are the same characters as in Onmyoji I, however, the story is more disjointed and the ending ratherodd. The characters and the production quality are still superior and enjoyable. Number I is by far the best though. Those who like a more dramatic rendition of folklore will probably enjoy this movie as it brings certain demon characters to life in interesting ways."
5,Great Lee Morgan Hardbop session,"If Lee was ever asked to record an albums so good that it would smoke all others, I have no doubt that he would say yes and keep his promise. ""Sixth Sense"" is one of those albums, it keeps knocking you in the head until you give in. I once asked a friend about Lee's later albums and he had his doubts but after listening to this, it becomes extremely hard to say no. Title track has a sort of quasi-bossa beat but it doesn't bear the feeling of his other Sidewinderish type tunes such as ""Cornbread"" or ""Yes I can no you can't"". The 3M front line (Morgan, Mitchell, Mclean) has a sharp and powerful drive. Higgins and Walton, two Morgan stalwarts, were perfect for the job. Higgins especially since he laid down the beat so heavily. The second session isn't quite as powerful as the first but has similar execution. Five notes for another great hardbop session from Lee."
5,Superb Late Bop,"I can't claim to know more than a portion of Lee Morgan's total output, but I have to say I have never heard anything of his that I don't like. And if I had to pick a favorite trumpeter at gunpoint, I would probably go with Lee over Miles--or anyone else, for that matter. (Except--let me add, in going over this review some time later--Clifford Brown.)Warm confident tone, tight phrasing, lyrical melodic vocabulary, tasteful voicing--what more can you ask for? It is a terrible loss to music and the world that he--like so many of the jazz giants--died so young.This CD version is a delight from beginning to end, and a good value with the bonus non-LP tracks. If you like Sixties bop and/or Lee Morgan I don't see how you can miss."
3,The Sixth Sense,"If you are a big fan of Lee Morgan and your collection doesn't include this CD I would sugguest you listen before you buy, I don't think that you are missing much if you don't have it. I think Morgan plays terrifically but I only found a couple of the songs to be interesting. The title track is exceptional and I bought the CD just for that song. If you are new to Lee Morgan I suggest that you check out Cornbread and the Gigolo and the ballad Carolyn on Hank Mobley's No Room for Squares. I think that it is in those recordings that you will really get a sense of the depth and range of Lee Morgan."
4,blue print of architecture,"Lane's book does and excellent job at analyzing architecture during the height of germanies history. We are all aware of the politics surrounding the period, but Lane shows the architecture and politics under the same light; as an influence for each other."
1,lie,i was fooled my the pichure . thinking the was 4 vhs tape . BUT ONLY ONE CANE ! well that the standard that here have.
3,Pretty Basic,"I bought this book for my 16 year old son. Read reviews but decided to go ahead anyway. What I didn't realize was that it assumes that you have access to nautilus equipment. I don't know why but I assumed it was ""weight training"" so it was using free weights. Oops. He's modified some exercises but it really is pretty basic information anyway. I would only recommend it if you REALLY have no idea which muscle groups you need to strengthen to play lacrosse."
2,Just ok,"This book is just OK - very dry and not very visually appealing. Very sparse. Probably better for adult who wants to expand their current training program, but did not interest teens."
4,Stellar Neville Brothers,"With Daniel Lanois'assistance, the Neville Brothers made their best recording ever. In the past, they have relied too much on Aaron's otherworldly falsetto; this time it's channeled into harmonies with his brothers and solos that emphasize its haunting quality, as opposed to its similarity to oddball acts like Tiny Tim. Solo standouts on the record - ""A Change is Gonna Come"" and ""With God on Our Side"" - highlight Lanois' impeccable musical choices, and the very effective melding of the trademark Neville sound with Lanois' ""sonics"", used successfully with other groups, such as U2.Unfortunately, these standouts - as well as ""Yellow Moon"" and another Dylan song, ""The Ballad of Hollis Brown"" - make some of the Neville choices, e.g. ""My Blood"", ""Healing Chant"" and ""Wild Injuns"", suffer by comparison. I'd like to see the pairing again, as the Neville's version of ""Down in the Hole"" (used as title music for one of ""The Wire"" seasons) clearly show that they have the chops."
5,Beyond excellent,"If you are a fan and not own this....what the heck are you waiting for?If you are not yet a f an, pick up this inexpensive gem and give it a listen"
3,love Aaron Neville,We were some what disappointmented due to the background music. We do not exactly like the bongo drums. But its OK.
5,Gift order,"I'n very happy with the order, it arrived on time, in good condition. It was gift for my mother-in-law who loved the recording when it was on vinyl. Thanks"
5,Diffusion in a jiffy,"Diffuse your Speedotron flashheads in a jiffy with these Lightsox diffusers. No gaffer tape. No hassle. Easy to use and, they fit perfectly on the reflector. Highly recommended by this 25 year professional photographer."
1,"too short, too shallow","This is a good beginning for a film--in fact, the first screen says ""Chapter One."" It was an unpleasant surprise to have it abruptly end before anything happened that I could sink my emotional teeth into. THIS FILM IS LESS THAN 30 MINUTES LONG, which was not stated in the descriptions. I wish I could get my money back."
4,A short but very funny film!!!,"A girl uses the public toilet on a fairground. Nothing special? Maybe right..if she wasn't pregnant suddenly. Wondering what happened to her and why, she tries to get along with her life when one night a very funny archangel Gabriel (brilliant: Malcolm McDowell) comes through her window and gives the answers, while joking around what types of girls god prefers. The film is short, but rather funny and I really enjoyed the story. For all those who don't like to read the bible ;)"
4,An Interesting Sequel,"Sunstorm is a nice second book in the Time Odyssey series continuing the story line of The Firstborn and their interference of life on Earth. New characters are introduced that give us a glimpse of a possible future some 30 years from now. The technology rings true in light of recent advances in computer technology, ecology, and space exploration. Clarke once again paints a picture of a future that not only is plausible but is likely."
2,Disappointing but readable,"After having read Time's Eye..I was anticipating a deeper insight into the nature of the FirstBorn, perhaps even more information about the Eyes...a stronger Bisesa Dutt. But I was disappointed. The story was pretty much told in the first few chapters...the rest of the book just dragged us along with the details of the shield and the boring lives of the protagonists. Bisesa herself is almost a non-entity, cowering in her home for most of the book. I also expected a stronger ending and a lead up to what could have been a third book if the ending is to be believed. Still, this was readable, if only to get to the end.."
2,sunstorm,"I must have read a different book than the newpaper reviews. I found the book dull and trite. I could skip five pages at a time and never miss anything in the story. It seemed to have a lot of filler of trivia. In my estimation, not up to the standards of the two authors. I thought the first book dragged at first but then got interesting. I was hoping the next book would continue where the first one left off, but no luck. SF authors should not try to write harlican novels."
3,Arthur C. Clarke hybrid,Not quite vintage Clarke but a good read. Has excellent character development. Those familiar with Clarke will recognize his atheistic biases. A good choice to team up with Stephen Baxter. Best understood when al the Time Odyssey series are read in sequence.
2,Not what I expected,"I went into reading this book immediately after the first (Time's Eye) and there was quite a bit of difference in writing styles. For one thing this book didn't flow as well, and I found it to be a bit boring at times. It didn't answer many questions at all about Time's Eye and the world of Mir, but it was still ok if you like the kind of book where humanity saves earth against incredible odds. Although I'm sure there are better books out there with such a premise. Still.. it was better than the third book which was a huge disappointment!"
2,Switch-a-roo,"Not a bad hard sci-fi read. But, not what I was expecting and wanting for a sequel. Time's Eye was a fun, fast read that left us wanting more. Instead, we get a whole new set of characters in a side story to the first. We learn almost nothing new of the Firstborn except from where they are from. All the while, we are forced to read through endless pages showing that the author knows a lot about science and his philosophical views on humanity. Not horrible, but I wouldn't have chosen to read this if it was pitched as a stand alone novel, which it is very close to being."
1,Very Disappointing,"If you are into reading chapter after chapter of pseudo-scientific techno-babble this book is for you. Otherwise, the story is extremely lame and the characters are two dimensional disposable pieces of cardboard. ""A Time Odyssey: Book Two"" is misleading as there's no time travel or time shifts involved and the part about being Book Two (Book One is the vastly better Time's Eye) is misleading as well - the part played by Bisesa is incidental and left undeveloped and as to the Firstborn: here's a complete summary of their role in the book: it's all their fault. There, you'll find no more about them.The book is not just bad given who the authors are. It's just plain bad. Really, really bad."
2,Please...,"I've read this idea before, nearly 3 years ago. It's called Decipher by Stel Pavlou. Clarke and Baxter write a significantly shorter book, but stylistically it's even identical in places, peering inside the sun to watch what's it's doing, and following how it works, while a shield is erected on earth. What exasperates me is Clarke and Baxter are getting praised for the idea, and Pavlou got criticized when he was first."
4,Much better than Time's Eye,"I was drawn to reading these two books after having loved Baxter's short story ""In the Abyss of Time"" published in Asimov's Science Fiction magazine. I thought Time's Eye, book one of this series, was just terrible. It was certainly not science fiction but rather historical what-if fantasy. Book 2, this Sunstorm, I thought was much much much better, very enjoyable, good sci-fi with a few nice twists. I am very much looking forward to book 3 though I agree with the reviewer who said that the dust jacket of this book was misleading in that it did not explain those issues."
4,Epic tale using science to save the earth,"I would like to review Sunstorm as a standalone book as it can definately be read that way. The idea of the people of earth coming together to save the planet is not a new one, this time against a huge solar flare originated by the first ones (an alien race) thousands of years ago. The first ones are just seen as spheres instead of obelisks from the 2001 era. The idea here is to build a shield to protect the earth from a flare that will erupt in 2042. The earth has 5 years to build it. A simple enough story but the science, characters and story writing are really enjoyable, and it has a great pace. I understand this is the second book in a new trilogy but from what i have read, the other two books do not add much to the mystery of the first ones and seem to have stories that aren't interesting enough to be my next read. Again, Sunstorm as a standalone novel is a great read in what can trigger the earth to accelerate its pace to the stars."
5,This is fun,"This is a fun boat to go out on the lake with. I do recommend the STEARNS - SEVYLOR SKEG FOR TAHITIS, FIJI AND BALI MODELS. Its a rooter that you must have or you will not be able to go straight. Its good for two people. Its big for one person."
2,Fail,"Poorly produced and executed. The routines are very simple, but the exercise moves are too fast to ensure good form and to avoid injury Glad I rented this before I bought it. Much prefer Crunch Cardio Dance Blast, which I did buy."
1,Not as I expected,"Item came very quickly and played without incident. I have no problem with the shipping or condition of the DVD. But, the cuing and exercises presented in the DVD were horrible. I did not even complete the workout. Would not recommend."
5,Angie's workout video is the best,"I have tried so many workout videos in the past. None of them is as good as Angie's. I had the pleasure of working out with Angie and it was great fun! So, I bought her video to workout at home. I love the customization of the video, the cardio sections and the toning sections with weights. The video also shows the different levels of intensity, a beginner's, intermediate and advanced and this is great because you can do the workout at your own pace and at your own level of intensity. Angie also demonstrates the safelty measures to correctly follow the techniques in different sections of the work out. I love this workout video! Since I have started working out with Angie's workout video, I have toned my muscles and I am able to maintain my weight goal! I highly recommend Angie's video to others and I can't wait for her second video to come out!!"
5,"Fun, Simple and Effective!","This workout DVD has simple yet effective moves! Easy to follow, yet challenging enough to get your heart rate up.Afterall, that's what produces result right?I like the count down clock, so you know that you can get through each segment.I also like that you can customize the workout. I go back and forth between weights, and cardio to get a wellrounded workout.Great price too! Highly recommend it to everyone! Way to Go Angie!"
2,Not as good as the first one,"Eko Eko Azarak was the best bad movie I ever seen. The sequel, not as amusing. It was never very scary or even funny. But I'm still going to watch the last part.."
2,So so,"Writing style was good but seriously lacked depth. The tension between the characters was based on something so small. When it was aired, they kept the tension, which did not make sense. The whole story really didnt make sense to me. The other title for my review could have been ""Huh?"""
4,A beginning.,"A great beginning for the intelligence analyst, law enforcement officer or the interested party. Comprehensive if a little dated today. Don't miss an opportunity to take a look. Also seek out further books, texts articles of this subject to advance your knowledge. Good reading."
5,Teach Yourself to Meditate in 10 Simple Lessons: Discover Relaxation and Clarity of Mind in Just Minutes a Day,"This is an excellent book. Very straight forward and to the point. After years of trying to meditate this is the book that I finally learned from. Since then I've developed my own system for teaching others (see my CD on amazon.com, keywords: Meditation Awareness Felder CD) Teach Yourself to Meditate in 10 Simple Lessons is the only book I recommend to my meditation students. Every one of my students who have purchased it agrees that it is the best, most understandable book they have read on the subject. Eric Harrison presents meditation in very easy to understand scientific terms for the layperson. Yet he gives a broad view of traditional techniques and styles. I obviously highly recommend it for any one who is serious about learning to meditate or improving their meditation skills. Thanks Eric, where ever you are."
2,Works only 2 weeks!!!!,I have used many after market bulbs with Nokya brand. But this one blew out after 2 weeks of use on my honda accord with Spyder halo projector headlights.
5,Excellent !,"The Blues the way they're supposed to be played, and sung ! Buddy Guy is the master story teller right up there along side The King !"
5,buddy guy,"this is probably one of the best buddy guy albums i own,just a buzz to be able to listen to this genius,i use this album in my clinic my patients absolutely love it,you know what they say,spread the love."
2,"Only for the fans (maybe), and beware the sound quality!","Even for avid Nice fans like me, this disc is hard to justify purchasing. The problem is that the recordings sound like they were recorded off of a table radio typical of the period. They go to some length in the notes about how they improved the quality from the originals, but you have to scratch your head and say why bother.However, kind of a thrill to hear the Nice playing Zappa's ""Lumpy Gravy"" (really!) Also interesting I suppose to hear most live versions - although ""Little Arabella"" is actually the studio mix from Ars Longa Vita Brevis(!!). That's the kind of production this is.All in all I just wish there was some way of knowing when you purchase this what you are getting, since this falls far short of today's standards for nostalgic live recordings (such as the Old Grey Whistle Test discs)."
2,If this is getting back to basics give me a full-blown orchestra,"I loved Le sac des filles, I want state that right off. This album, however many times i have listened to it, fails to make me feel anything but wish for a remote to turn it off. All the beatbox effects are very clever I suppose. In the end it is nothing but but self-indulgence at its worst."
5,A Capella incredibile!,"In any language, this is just a unique expression of musical talent. Every song starts with that same tone but she builds such a variety of songs on top of that tone. Really cool idea, but mainly because of Camille. It is music with humor sometimes, and sometimes a dreamy quality, and sometimes she lets loose where you realize she has more than just the little girl voice. I have always loved it when a band is playing and then there is an A Capella part with an awesome vocalist. Well, this feels like that, but she adds some minimal instrumentation that is perfect. Great music!"
4,Unique,This c.d. is definitely out of my genre but a freind gave me a copy and now i'm hooked on both her c.d.s. Alot of people are comparing her to bjork but I would prefer camille. I don't speak a word of french but whatever she's saying it sounds beautiful. A very mesmerizing c.d. to listen to. Her first album is excellent as well.
5,Interesting,"I discovered her by accident - just looking for some interesting music in France.It is really great. She is an amazing singer and she plays with her voice cleverly. And her voice predominates in every song, often even avoiding instruments or replacing them with her own track of voice. The ""Assise"" song is my favorite.I heard labeling her as a French Bjork."
3,Been a long time...,"I read this book when I was in 7th grade, which was.... oh, let's see... I'm 30 now... so that means I read this book approximately seven billion years ago. Or so it seems. Anyway, I also wrote a report on this book for English class. The book was okay, but to this day I remember one glaring error: the author named Elvis' first post-army film ""G.I. Joe."" Of course, that title should be ""G.I. Blues."" Hopefully that error has been corrected in this new edition."
3,Sign Of Things To Come,"Compared to his first album INSIDE, which had about a dozen producers and dozens of top session musicians, EARTH is a decidedly more orderly affair. One production team handles all the tracks, resulting in a more consistent listen. For the first time, Robert Quine and Richard Lloyd handle most of the lead guitar duties, as they would on Sweet's following 3 (and far more commercially successful) albums. Sweet's songwriting skills aren't quite as impressive here as they would prove to be on later albums, although he is consistant: there's not a bad song on here and the high points (""When I Feel Again"", ""Vertigo"", ""Easy"") really are high. Oddly enough, there's nothing here as impressive as tracks like ""Quiet Her"" and ""Love I Trusted"" from INSIDE. But if you're already a fan of Sweet's music and you've got everthing else (including INSIDE) give this one a try."
4,Earth (1989),"This is not the most popular Matthew Sweet title out there, but it sure is better than his debut in 1986, and some of his recent works. When I got this back in '89 ""Easy"" was being played on the radio.(hard to believe). Richard Lloyd helped atthew here on guitar. Songs that crack this CD: The above mentioned song ""Easy"",""When I Feel Again"", ""Children Of Time(Forever)"",""Vertigo"", ""Underground"",""The Alchol Talking"",and the funky ""Vixen"" with back up vocals by Kate Pierson(of the B52's). If it weren't for the 80's programming it might of gotten a higher rating. Matthew would release his classic ""Girlfriend""***** next, followed by ""Altered Beast""**** and ""100% Fun""****1/2, these would be his high water mark albums."
2,Only works if plugged in.,The name of this product is misleading. The whole thing is defective. It only works if the battery is plugged into the wall. That is the only way to power it up and to power the Gameboy Advance on. Once you remove the plug the Gameboy Advance will constantly shut down. Do not buy this.
1,GARBAGE!!,"When I purchased this I was sure there was going to be sex, sex, and more sex. Girls being sold into sex slavery and stuff like that....HA!!! There is not one sex scene in the whole movie and on top of that it was grainy and you could barley here what they were saying...SAVE UR MONEY PLEASE!!"
5,Great 1st episode!,"I enjoyed watching the first episode. I've always wanted to watch it but could never find the time. And now, with prime membership, I can finally watch it. Thank you Amazon!"
3,great show bad seller,the only thing i didnt like was that i didnt get the box set instead i got some blockbuster copies. i wanted the box set for my collection
3,Quality,"I purchased this season knowing it was ""acceptable"". We watched the first DVD in the set and it was good. We then started the second DVD and it was ""poor"". It kept freezing and we had to fast forward it a number of times which gets old fast! In the future I will only purchase a used set that is ""like new"". For the price I can't complain too much, but do yourself the favor and spend the extra few bucks to get a DVD that runs properly."
4,Well worth buying.,"This is a funny and addictive comedy.Very witty, sharp and well observed, it also has a good dose of slapstick.The basic story is a loveable rogue trying to be good against the odds."
3,Too Corny Earl,"I purchased the Earl first season for my son's 15th birthday. He loves this comedy series and watches them all the time. Now he wants the 2nd season. I would recommend this videos to the younger genre but they are really not for me. Most of the time, it's pretty clean entertainment."
2,Disc one doesn't work,The product was shipped very quickly (less than a week) but the disc one doesn't work in my dvd player and my computer: the CD is scratched.No problem with the disc two.
5,good stuff,"this show is excellent. it manages to be hysterical, feel-good, racy, sweet, and surprising all at the same time. i didn't know what to expect when i bought this dvd (i had never seen the show and only bought it because i am a huge fan of jason lee) but i was definitely not disappointed. each of the characters are loveable in their own way and the show is very smartly done. plus, the blooper reel and 'earl misadventure' features are hilarious. jason lee is great as earl, you can't help but love him."
5,Funny!!!!,"""My name is Earl"" Season 1, is the start of a great sitcom,that falls into the same catagory as the old ""All in the Family"",""Sanford & Son"" ""The Jeffersons"",""Good Times"" etc.Gut hurting laugh out loud comedy.Awesome."
5,Don't miss out,A must see! Some of the funniest stuff in a long time. I laughed so much my face hurt.
5,We love Earl!,"There's just something endearing about Earl Hickey, who has his own interpretation of ""karma."" When there's nothing on television worth watching, my husband and I watch the first season of ""My Name is Earl."" I particularly liked the episode when Earl tried to make up for ruining his ex-wife's wedding."
4,His name is Earl.,Its an entertaining show to watch. I am looking forward to watching the next item he crosses off his list and if his ex is ever successful at getting his money.
1,I am going to bring it back to Walmart for a refund,This is a breeding ground for bacteria. The base of the unit contains a water reservoir that does not get vaporized after the main water storage container is empty. The water there in the bottom of the reservoir gets brownish. I don't want brown water getting vaporized into the air. The user manual tries to explain how the humidifier works but it seems to have been written by someone who could care less about what the customer thinks.
2,Lower quality than expected,"Live in Phoenix, Arizona and need humidity just to survive the dry air here. This unit claimed to be quiet and included anti-microbial in nature. I will say, these claimes are not a fair representation of the product. Always had problems with mildew buildup, even when using the chemicals requested by manufacturer. After a few days the unit started to vibrate to the point the dishwasher is considered tolerable. We would have to shim the water tank with folded paper and toothpicks to get vibrations to lessen. Sometimes a smack on the side did the trick. After two months the unit started to leak out the intake vents.Unit requires refilling every 22 hours or so on medium fan speed. All in all, I think this unit gives humidifiers a bad wrap as I am sure you can get a better unit with less hassles. As it is, $50 is a lot to spend on a night light."
3,Its great when its working properly,"I'm on my 4th one for this humidifier (I have the one w/o the night light)LIKES1) no filter to replace2) relatively easy cleaning (just soak in vinegar/water and brush)3) quiet enough for me to sleep on LOW4) large 2.5 container so dont need to refill frequently5) it works! i sleep better, and my hygrometer proves itDISLIKES1) it breaks down and stops working or leaks, or gurgles after 1 or 2 months2) gets to be noisy when on MED (specially on HIGH)"
2,Carefree?,"I bought this product April 23,2006, and started noticing water spiting out rear grill. The screws inside housing are starting to rust. I think they should of used brass screws. Its a little noisey on high setting,low setting is a bit better. I am sending it back to hunter and they are sending me a different model. Ill give it a second try. I do own a very nice ceiling fan that I have had for over a year and no problems!"
1,I get irritated every time I look at it,"After about 1.5 months, it started leaking. Even though I filled it with filtered water, calcium deposits were all over the inside. I wiped out the inside with CLR (lime and calcium remover) and soaked the filters in CLR. Within 3 days, it was spitting out water again. And not just a little bit of water, either. I'd placed it on a huge beach towel that I'd folded up as many times as possible...maybe came to 3"" of towel that it was placed on. The next morning, the towel was DRENCHED...I mean, I picked it up and water was dripping out of the towel. I phoned their ""customer service"" number listed in the manual about 3 times. I was on hold for so long each time, I gave up. Now it's just sitting in my living room and I'll probably throw it out. What a waste of $50. Oh, and when it WAS working, it was noisy. I had to turn my TV volume up to a level I hope did not disturb my neighbors (apartment living)."
1,Horrible,"Mildew builds up every few days. Directions for cleaning are unclear; cannot remove the ""sponge"" for cleaning. Unit is too loud on all but ""low"" setting, which doesn't make for much humidification. Water dribbles from tank after filling. Have to ""jiggle"" the water tank every day in order to get enough water in the unit for the pump to work properly. This unit is anything but ""carefree"".This series of Hunter humidifiers is horrible. They should have stuck to making ceiling fans."
1,3 strikes,"I thought the first two units I purchased were just defective. I tried a third and cannot understand why this is such a highly rated product in some of the consumer magazines. They work well for a couple of months then start spitting water and wetting all the surfaces around. It is hard to clean, loud and much to expensive. I would not recommend this humidifier."
1,where to start??,"We bought this humidifer last year at Menard's. It was so noisy from the beginning I could hardly believe it. I bought it because I had an awful cold and instead of relieving my dry nose and throat, it kept me awake. Also I cannot sense any humidity in the air even if I hold my hand over the vent. And it is like having an air conditioner in the room. The vent blows cold air but, from what I can sense, not much else. We cannot run it with the TV without turning up the volume. Didn't anyone try this thing before they put it on the market???"
1,Not recommended,"The unit is disappointing. The fan is noisy even on lowest setting. The case design makes access to filters cumbersome. The permanent filters themselves seem good and quite robust.. The unit badly needs automatic operation. As it is, it runs constantly even when comfortable humidity levels have been reached. There is no humidity level indicator. A basic no-frills machine but many others are better although maintenance is low on this unit.."
1,Couldn't sleep,Just warning you that this makes such weird sounds that you nor the kids will be able to sleep. The kids complained about it so I moved it to my room and found out they weren't exaggerating. Horrible noises and not easy to take care of. I ended up throwing ours out - a waste of money.
4,"Works good, but a bit loud on high.","I tried a filter free before this one... bad idea. This humidifier works fairly well and is easy to clean and refill. It has a somewhat large base size and is loud on high mode. Overall, I really like it, it works and there is no dust like a filterless!! GOOD PRODUCT!!!"
2,Design defect,"Worked wonderfully until the handle to the tank suddenly gave way while I was carrying the tank from the sink back to the unit after filling it. The tank crashed down, breaking upon impact, sending water everywhere. Thankfully no child or pet was underfoot when this occurred, as the weight of the crashing tank would have been great. The handle is attached with only a single plastic peg. Recommend against relying on the handle alone when carrying."
1,"Not exactly ""Care-Free""","This unit claims to be care-free, but it definitely isn't. If the water that collects in the base isn't cleaned out every 3 days it starts to look yellowish and the unit no longer humidifies. And you have to remove everything to take the base to the sink to clean it out. Messy and a PITB."
4,Own 2,After reading all of the bad commends I thought I would post some good ones. I have two units. One was given to us. Both are several years old now and we have had no problems. Cleaning them is just part of using them and there does not seem to be a way around that. We try to clean them weekly. I may try the bleach trick someone recommmended. Either I am lucky to have bought one that worked or the only people willing to write reviews are those who are upset about purchasing a faulty unit.
4,I like it!,"I use this in my 2 year olds room every night year-round. It actually serves 2 purposes for us, humidity for the air and white noise. The sound of the humidifier on low actually helps keep her asleep and drowns out other noises in the house and outside. The people who say that it needs alot of maintenance have not used humidifiers very much. This humidifier, IF USED AND CARED FOR PROPERLY, is pretty low maintenance. I empty the tank every morning and remove the housing unit to let it dry out each day. If that is too much maintenance then I don't know what to say. About once a month I wipe down all the plastic parts and have only had to soak the Permawick filters in water and vinegar once in over a year. I love the nightlight feature also. If you are looking for alot of humidity in the room then you may want to get a vaporizer and not a humidifier.Bottom Line: Great product, a little noisier than expected but has worked out fine, low maintenance."
1,A piece of junk.,"The bearing in the fan motor failed, producing a loud siren-like sound. I thought the cops had finally tracked me down! Rats! I'm busted! Fortunately it was only my piece of junk humidifier. I took it back to the store and returned to my life of crime."
2,If you're looking for a quiet unit - this isn't for you,"I purchased this unit the other day to replace our previous cool mist humidifier that wore out. I am using it for my 2-year old daughter's bedroom at night. My main goals were to 1. find a unit which was very quiet and 2. find a unit with minimal maintenance (i.e. filters). I used it in her room for one night and couldn't believe how noisy it was! I had it down on the lowest setting and thought that it was still way too loud. And the other two settings were totally obnoxious. I think that they definitey misrepresent it on the box when they advertise ""whisper quiet"". I don't know about anyone else, but when I whisper, it's much quieter than this unit!Since I promptly returned it, I can't speak to the maintenance of the unit. Outside of it running very loud, it seemed like a good unit. So, if you like lots of white noise, this would probably be the humidifier for you!"
1,A disaster- stay away from it,"Very noise, gets really dirty easily, the filters look old after a month of use. Not recommended at all."
3,Not all bad,I just bought 2 of these humidifers and while the workmanship could be improved the units do the job. Our headaches and dry skin problems are gone. The noise factor on low is very good and of course as you increase the fan speed the noise level goes up but not enought to drive you crazy. WalMart had the units for less than $40.00. Amazon wants almost $60.00 and I found these units selling for as high as 75.00.
2,Tempermental Humidifier,"This humidifier looks great on paper...but in reality, it does a poor job. The first month it worked alright. It's just too loud. Even on the lowest setting sometimes it's unbearably loud and sometimes it's bearable. I never know how it's going to sound like until I turn it on. Not only is it loud sometimes, it doesn't do a very good job of rotating the water flow which leaves it stagnant and turns yellow. I have to clean it every week and not once a season as it claims. I've had it for two months now and it's leaking water and I can't figure out why...I'm going to send it back. Too bad this had to happen after the 30 days money back guarantee."
4,Icing on the cake of the trilogy,"I liked the story, but the characters seemed a little too hyperreal for my usual tastes. This one seemed to come off as the less interesting sister of ""When Heaven Weeps"". It was still an interesting story reinforcing the point of sacrificial love, and well worth the read."
5,Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Words don't do Ted Dekker justice I love all his books! This was one of those books once you pick up it is so hard to put down!!
5,Changed My View of Christian Novels,"Allow me to be honest: I resisted reading Christian fiction for a long time because I thought it would be, well, boring. I'm a Christian, but sermons are for the pulpit, not the printed page. Or so I thought. Thunder of Heaven completely sideswiped me with a great opening, a fast pace, and an interesting cast of characters who pop with realism. My favorite is Casius, a CIA assassin. The book follows him and the daughter of two married missionaries as they grapple with the slaughter of their parents and try to stop a terrorist attack. The jungle setting is a cool stage for this story to play out. The only time I realized I wasn't reading a thriller shaped by any of the great writers of our time is when the author dropped in a spiritual insight or two-and even those were interesting. I highly recommend this book."
5,I'm Still New at This . . .,". . . So please bear with me. This is my second Dekker book, and if I was surprised by Heaven's Wager, this one blew my socks off. This is a rocket ride. And the love theme is really done well. Right from the get-go, things start happening, and it doesn't let up until the shocking finish. Tanya and Shannon are great characters, I really came to care about them. All in all, a terrific read. Don't miss it!"
3,GG Allin and Jesus,"I found Mahesh Blatt's biography of U.G. Krishnamurti to be a pretty interesting and entertaining read. Although it is written from a personal focus (Blatt is, after all, a film director) and is sometimes bordering on a-bit-too-personal-for-my-taste, it gives a good glimpse on the 'unrational ideas' of U.G. This guy is pretty hard to take, and his attacks on J.Krishnamurti and Rajneesh (Osho) are sure to stir controversy among spiritual aspirants, but I'm getting a hunch that's what's called for. A mix between GG Allin and Jesus; U.G.'s bio would give a good starting point for someone implicitly religious who's not into ""bleeding heart spirituality."""
1,This book is a lie,"When I read this book, I was disappointed with it. I thought that a lot of the power of the story was lost in translation, as is always the case with books in translation, especially from a romance language into a germanic one. However, I was willing to ignore this because finally one of my countrywomen had won a Nobel Prize for her work. A couple of years later, i read an article in the Washington Post stating that Ms. Menchu had ""embellished"" her story, adding extra drama. As if the Guatemalan tragedy needs drama to make it real and poignant. And indeed, it was true. Ms. Menchu was asked by many to give back her Nobel prize. I don't remember if she did. If anyone knows whether Ms. Menchu gave back her prize, do tell. The book itself is boring and plodding. It did not communicate with the reader the way good books do. This is non-fiction that reads like the worst fiction."
2,Good (if unwitting) expose of Indian culture,"I was made to read this book as part of a course on Latin American history. While mostly drivel, it is valuable in its insights into the Indian mindset and the root causes of Indian poverty. It's hard to miss in Rigoberta's narrative the many reasons why Native American cultures have all but died out -- after all, she describes the ignorant workings of her own backward culture in detail."
1,i like her personal experience,"she's is a real maya, and she is able to express herself as an european, she's a great translator of the maya culture and is an example to the new generation"
5,Most intense account I've ever read on global inequalities,"Ever page of this book is a lesson in history, politics and economics. We don't know what our lives are really worth until we read the accounts of this woman's experiences as a human being treated as a pile of dirt. Do yourself a favor, read this book, learn from it and apply the lesson you learn from it in your own lives. I know I plan on doing it."
5,"Touching, real, eye-awakening","A humble, yet uninihibted account of a people's struggle from a strong survivor who risks all to tell her story."
1,This work devalues the Nobel Prize...,"We have lived in Guatemala for several years and know people who know her and her family along with living through the war. It's too bad the Nobel people didn't do their research as this book is not the truth of what happened to her but a fabrication. It really does degrade the award. Then, after received the awared, while her people suffered there in Guatemala, she was living the high-life on the $1,000,000 prize. Not until there was great outrage by her home town, threatening to expose her, did she donate a small portion of her awared towards a local school. I agree however with another comment that says at least it drew attention to the atrocities that happened during the war. Those things were absolutely horrible!"
2,Nice work of fiction...,I believe this book has some value. There are some nice insights into the mind and culture of the quiche maya people. This book also presents a nice study of marxist class struggle. Unfortunately only a small percentage of this book is to be believed...If you find that this book reads like a classic marxist example of class and ethnic struggle don't be surprised. Menchu herself was much more aligned to the marxist guerillas in the mayan highlands than she wanted you to believe in this book and her book was written with the help of a french leftist. It's unfortuante that menchu's story of pain suffering and struggle have been used for the benefit of the left in this country and europe as well as guatemala. Certainly many have been duped into thinking this story is true and it convinced the gullible nobel commitee to give her the 1992 peace prize...
4,Great for any little girl,"This is a great item to have in any little girl's room. My child loves it and wants to know what ""number"" she is, almost every day.She is really excited to find out that she grew a little more. The only draw back is that the ruler is not accurate, and if you really want to find out how tall she is, you might need to use a different ruler. We attached one next to this one, and it works."
3,BRUCE DEBUT IS GOOD!!!!!,"Bruce debut is good...it's similar to the style Bruce incorporate in the early 90's, with less screams and a more raw voice...There's some classics from his solo career as the title track, BORN IN 58 and SON OF A GUN...well, it reminds me something from NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING, so it's not really a incredible album like BALLS TO PICASSO and ACCIDENT OF BIRTH...if you like IRON MAIDEN or the solo Bruce stuff, you will enjoy TATTOOED MILLIONARE!!!!!!"
5,A really fun album,"I have the non re-master and have been listening to it for like 7 or 8 years! Bruce has one of the all-time classic metal voices and he can write some dern catchy songs. ""Tattooed Millionaire"" is not a heavy album in terms of philosophy but is playful and light-hearted. Very different from Maiden, in a good way. Songs like ""Lickin' the Gun,"" ""Zulu Lulu,"" and ""Dive! Dive! Dive!"" are quite humorous. Usually need to listen to this album after spinning some Slayer or Children of Bodom- it cleanses my brain like Drano! -David J Newman 2003"
4,Janick Gers (Iron Maiden),"This isnt really a review although I do like the CD. Im just a little curious, Everyone seems to slam Janick Gers, Did he do something bad, I just saw Iron Maiden along with DIO and Motorhead and as you Maiden heads know Janick is in the lineup, all the guitar work I heard that night was beyond anything my mere words could describe, What an outstanding concert.If someone could shed a little light on the constant Janick slaming for me I would really appreciate it!"
1,WHAT A LOAD OF TOSH,"This is absolutely terrible and that is being generous. He is an idiot.He thought he could ditch maiden and then waltz back in again he is arrogant. Blaze is much better than him and so is blazes solo career with his band blaze. Bruce dickinsons solo career is so bad it makes me sick to think that tatooed millionaire gets a good review he is a traitor to maiden and this album is bad.Even britney spears is better than this tosh, give up bruce and get a new life, tatooed millionaire what kind of a bad name is that and he looks queer on the front cover so foresham to anyone who has bought this.Goodbye"
3,Scratching Post w/feather toy,"I am giving a 3 star because the service was very slow on getting to me! As far as the product the cats won't be bothered with the scatch post, but use a differt one that I ordered! The feathers fell off of the products in about 30 minutes from the cats playing with only them! For my felines this product was a waste of money! Other cats my use, but not mine ;{"
5,Incredibly relaxing,I got this sampler as a gift and was able to try all the different oils. I absolutely loved each oil but gravitated toward the Juniper (muscle relaxation) and the Eucalyptus (sinus relief). I get migraines and soaking in a hot tub with the Eucalyptus or the Lavender (stress relief) was essential to the healing process. I would highly recommend these oils to anyone who needs to destress. Absolutely the best out there.
5,Education Professor,"This is excellent reading material for anyone that needs to reflect on their own personal lives. I have used the same values that the book refers to in my own classroom, and my students have embrased it wholeheartedly. We will continue to used this book as a resource to further analyze what constitutes the making of a community and self development. Again, Great Little Book. Robert Cortez"
4,Bought as a gift,"It's adorable. My only complaint is that it feels just a little under-stuffed in the middle, but aside from that, it's great."
3,smartshopper,Was a lil disappointed in this frame. The plastic was chipped off and broken in one of the corners. If you are looking for something practical..well.. here ya go. But nothing special.
5,Worth the cost!,"This version of Brigadoon, still unavailable on CD, was from the 1968 Armstrong Television broadcast,starring Peter Falk (later famous for his role as detective Columbo), Tommy Carlisle, Sally Anne Howes, and Robert Goulet. While the acting on this TV special was only passable, the Lerner and Lowe music was still exquisite. Goulet, Carlisle, and Howes not only do the songs justice, but if anything they are better than the Broadway cast. For those who love Lerner and Lowe music, especially Brigadoon, and who are only familiar with the Broadway or Hollywood verions available on CD, this LP is well worth the cost! Spin it, and enjoy!"
1,Do women really read this crap?,"So, I'm searching for Bounty Select-a-size paper towels on Amazon and this book pops up. The listing for the book includes some pages from the book to get a little peek inside. Of course, the passage discussed having only Bounty Select-a-Size paper towels to handle her heavy menses. Seriously.Anyway, I read a page ot two just out of sheer bordem. Total crap.Too bad you ladies can't appreciate NFL Football (for the most part)."
2,The rare good story is overshadowed by its poor cousins.,"Only a couple of the stories' authors showed the adventuring spirit that would drive them climb Everest simply because it's there-few tales show an appreciation of the outdoors for its own sake. Among the bulk of the authors, braving the wilds incorporates barricading oneself in one's hotel room, a remote trek through the Himalaya climaxes with an enlightening tantrum and adventure is measured by paranoia. The majority of these heroines confront more neuroses than wildlife."
4,Nice work,Listening to the Sequoia is a very pleasant experience and brings one closer to the Big Tree. Definitely recommend it.
4,Just When You Think You've Got a Large Family...,"This fantastic film is a nice reality check for the ""large"" modern family. If you've got more than the socially approved one boy, one girl family, you'll love this flick. What makes the movie great rather than good is its grasp on reality; it does not gloss over problems, idealize one age/phase over another, or shy away from showing the challenges of laundry, cooking, etc.If for no other reason, the film is well worth watching for Fonda's soliloquy on love when questioned by his teenage daughter: 'loving a man isn't going to bed with him, but waking up with him in the morning to face this miserable, wonderful world...'After finding the original Cheaper By the Dozen dated & patriarchal and the remake just ridiculous, I am THRILLED to have come across Yours, Mine and Ours."
4,Blended Families,"In a change of pace from her usual goofy, zany tv characers, Lucille Ball plays a widowed mother of eight kids that falls in love with Henry Fonda, a widower/naval officer with ten kids. If that sounds like a famous tv program, it is sort of, but that doesnt' take away from the enjoyment of this film. Fonda and Ball are terrific together, and it is nice to see Lucy playing someone a little more real and normal. She brings her great comedy timing, but also a lot of warmth and decency to the character. The scenes with the eighteen kids in the house are a lot of fun, as is Lucy's drunk scene and the scenes surrounding their blind dates. This isn't a hysterically funny, holding-your-side kind of comedy, but it is a warm, affectionate look at the perils of blended families, which in the hands of Ball, Fonda, and some good child actors, is very amusing and entertaining."
4,Pretty good,"I liked it the first time, but I've seen it twice since then, and it's definately best the first time. If it were rated, it would be PG, I don't know about the rest of you, but I know that the innapropriate parts went right over my 5 year old sister's head, so I don't really mind that she saw it."
4,"Great Book, even BETTER price!","I first read this book years ago. I recently wanted to purchase them again for the team I'm currently working with. As we go through some rather drastic changes in our work environment, I wanted a few of these books to pass around. Purchasing them on line made it possible for me to not just loan them the book but let them keep it if they so chose to do so. The books arrived quickly and in good condition. I would order again from this vendor."
2,5 stars if DVD came with widescreen film version,"This is a 5-star flick but it's reduced to a 2-star review on Amazon because you're missing half of the film with this 'pan and scan' version. The day a its released in the original widescreen version is the day I buy a copy. Until then, we'll continue watching the widescreen version on a recorded VHS copy done when PBS played it years ago."
3,Yours mine and ours,"This is a great movie, and I am so glad I could share it with my young daughter. Only wish the sound track could keep up with the picture and the words came out of the actor's mouth at the same time as they were spoken. Otherwise, an enjoyable experience."
1,I Love Lucy,"Great film but who wants to watch a film like this in pan and scan format. Listen up studios, WIDESCREEN, WIDESCREEN, WIDESCREEN!!!!"
1,"Not ""mine"" - as long as it's in stupid standard screen!","This is a 4 star film reduced to 1 star because it's been butchered down from widescreen to standard screen for no reason whatsoever.Heck, you NEED the vast viewing range of wonderful widescreen in this flick just to keep track of all those dang kids!It was shot in widescreen in 1968, as were about 95% of all films made after 1953, so there's no excuse for chopping it down to this putrid pan-and-scan nightmare. Another Amazon reviewer (from Derby, CT) said it all about this ridiculous ripoff of an otherwise very cute movie:""Great film but who wants to watch a film like this in pan and scan format. Listen up studios, WIDESCREEN, WIDESCREEN, WIDESCREEN!!!!"""
5,A great comedy for the family!,"Yours, Mine and Ours is based on a true story. The idea to make Helen and Frank Beardsley's life into a movie came from Lucille Ball herself, who read an article about the couple in a magazine and thought it would make a good film.The movie is about a widow, Helen North, a nurse for the Navy, who has eight children. She meets Navel officer Frank Beardsley, a widower, who has ten children (one of his sons, Mike, is played by Tim Matheson). They begin dating and soon they're married.. Although, the kids aren't very happy about their parents marrying new people. But the family is in for a shock while Frank is away at sea!Also starring Van Johnson, this is a fantastic, heartwarming comedy that the entire family will enjoy. Lucille Ball, as usual, is hysterical and Henry Fonda is charming and just as funny. This is one of Lucy's best performances!"
5,A Family for All,"What happens when a widower with ten kids and a widow with eight kids cross paths in a San Francisco Naval commissary? The new American family circa 1968. Helen North (Lucille Ball), a Naval nurse, meets Frank Beardsley (Henry Fonda), a Naval officer, and the sparks fly instantly. Despite their reservations about their interest in each other due to their children, they give love a second chance and marry. Frank uses his Naval intellect while Helen uses her love of family to care for this very large brood. There are many one liners about the generation gap that will make you laugh. Lucille Ball has a fabulously funny scene were she is drunk due to the boys spiking her drink. Henry Fonda has nutty Van Johnson as his side kick. Watch for their huge grocery bill of $126. Can't begin to imagine what their grocery bill would look like today."
5,"Will never be ""topped""","Not even the Dennis Quaid remake can top this classic movie. Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball are priceless in this true story. It's worth watching over and over again. When two large families merge into one there has to be all kinds of problems that have to be addressed. The humorous and sobering side of life are handled in this film and lessons can be learned no matter the person's age. Like I said earlier, this original film cannot be out done. It's classic and worth having in your video collection."
3,Great Movie But A Disappointing DVD!,"Yours, Mine and Ours is a one of my favorite movies and is based on the true story of a widow with eight children and a widower with ten children who meet, fall in love, get married and combine their large families to make an even larger family. This is a very charming and cute movie but I'm disappointed that the DVD is fullscreen only and doesn't include a widescreen version. How come you can watch this movie on TCM in widescreen but the DVD only gets fullscreen?"
5,"Yours, Mine and ours",Great family movie. Get the kids together and watch the movie with them. Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda show how it really should be to raise a hugh family. Great humor.
5,"If you are looking for a great movie, this is it!",Yours Mine and Ours is the best family film. The story is hilarious and at the same time romantic. This is perfect movie for an occasion. Anyone who enjoys Lucille Ball will love it!
4,HENRILU,"Based on the true story of the Beardsley family who lived in Monterey County, California, this is one of Lucy's finer latter-day performances (her drunk scene is a delight). Essentially, the story is a movie version of how the Brady Bunch got together and although a little dated it's a most enjoyable family film (for some reason, entertainment from the period 1967-1972 dates badly (especially TV shows, i.e. ""Room 222"", ""Courtship of Eddie's Father"", ""That Girl"", ""Mod Squad"", ""Family Affair"" and the like.) As a footnote: In 1942, Lucy had her great chance at a meaty dramatic role in ""The Big Street"" in which she starred with 37 year-old Fonda. Lucille played Gloria, selfish and rather bitchy showgirl who essentially becomes a cripple; Hank played Little Pinks a devoted admirer. Ball was mostly praised by the critics, but, alas, the picture didn't make a dime."
5,This is a timeless classic worth owning!,"I remember seeing this movie as a child but didn't remember the name of the movie. It's one of a few movies that I always remembered and searched through countless video reviews to try to locate. I was ecstatic when I found it and, unlike many fond memories of things from my youth, I was not at all disappointed when I watched this for a second time. It was as enjoyable as ever! And my 11-year-old son enjoys it as well! It's so nice to know that some movies don't have to be remade or ""spiced up"" to still be appreciated by today's culture. Yes, having a family of 18 children might seem outlandish to some, but I would much rather my children watch classic movies like this one as opposed to watching some of the filthy and raunchy stuff out there today...."
4,Belly Laughing Riot!,"I rate this a 4 star movie because the first half of the movie is one continuous laugh after another, up to Lucy's classic drunk scene (reminicent of ""Vitameatavegimin""). After that it takes a turn toward a more ""serious"" comedy. The dialogue and physical comedy give way to the eight-is-enough situational comedy/drama. Overall, the first half is so funny that you won't mind the directional change. The price is a fair trade off for the draw back of a full frame picture. Always a loss when the maker's choose against the always preferred letterboxed edition. Still, DVD is better than video, and this movie is better than most comedies made now-a-days! Enjoy!!"
5,Lucille Ball,"I have yet to view this movie, but based on the quality of the stars, I am sure I will enjoy it."
3,"(The Old Version Of)Yours,Mine and Ours","Dear kidsI think the new(2005)Version Is Better.I Still think this movie is cute,though!Still,You should watch this movie when you have a chance!Sincerely,Matt Aurand"
1,dvd does not work properly,"The DVD ""Yours, Mine and Ours"" does not work properly in our DVD player. I do not know if it is the player problem or the DVD. All other DVDs in the house (there are dozens) work as they should. Yours, Mine and Ours will not load properly and freezes about half way through. It acts as if it cannot read.Can you shed some light?"
1,"""Disappointed""","After reading the reviews I certainly expected more from this film especially with a star studded cast.. The acting was good however I was disappointed with the many different references to sex, spoken and unspoken which in my view does not make for fun family viewing.. The disrespect shown by the children was also disappointing especially in light of the time period portrayed.. Would I watch this with my children again?? No! Would I watch it again my self?? Probably not!! I just think I will stay with the Lucy's I enjoy..."
1,"Children and children and attitudes, oh my","Wouldn't I love to find jam all over this DVD. Then I could throw it away (which is all it really deserves anyway). Although we won't throw ours away - we'll donate it to the library. perhaps somebody will like it.This was really pathetic 1960's cinema: Gone is the class and glamour of 1930's MGM. No taste in clothes, no taste in home decor (much), no taste in raising children. I couldn't believe that Mother didn't even reprimand the son for having the Playboy magazine? Family film? Not a chance in my house.I have to confess I was laughing sometimes during this film, but not because it was funny. It was incredibly UN-funny. I don't find rude children and parents sort of lost out there somewhere amusing. I would never watch it again, and certainly advise anyone else never to watch it in the first place."
3,Children and more children.,"Yours, MIne and Ours is a sweet family film but some of the scenes are kind of boring and unfunny. Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda have great chemistry together, in the movie both of them have a lot of children and when they get married, boy talk about a blended family! Some of the kids are annoying, some are helpful. If you like The Brady Bunch then you'll probably enjoy this flick. Enjoy!"
3,Love this film.,I don't really know what it is about this movie that I enjoy so much. I just do. It is fun and light and a little silly.
1,"ack!! ""my dad is not awesome""","I bought this as a surprise for my husband to read with my daughter b/c he is awesome! but instead my daughter's conclusion and statement was ""my dad is not awesome""ack!! b/c this guy can juggle more and play more instruments than my husband. etc etc.oh no! so beware!"
3,Same book as My Dad is Brilliant,"I was hoping these were different, but they are the the SAME book if you replace awesome with brilliant.My Dad Is BrilliantOtherwise, we love this series of books."
3,Just Average,"I just finished the book and thought it was just OK. Nothing special, and not good enough to recommend to friends.Cons:I thought the last 1/4 of the book covered a lot of ground without the detail that was provided in the rest of the story.I liked that the story covered a lot more than just underwater fight sequences, but I think the scope was a little too big to be covered convincingly.Pros:The techno portion of techno-thriller was very good. I enjoyed all of the technical details.The story was interesting, even though it was a bit fragmented.Options:Instead of this book, I'd recommend Larry Bond's Dangerous Ground (the best sub book I've read since Clancy's The Hunt for Red October, still my all-time favorite sub book.)"
4,Inside flap description:,"Here are ten stories of the future by the editor of Analog Science Fiction-Science Fact magazine; ten glimpses of tomorrows that are different, disturbing and very real.The stories in the collection represent several different futures, reports from the tomorrowland that lie ahead of the human race. The first story could happen next week - or perhaps it has already happened. Each subsequent story takes place further ahead in the future than the previous one, The time scale is logarithmic: the jumps in time grow larger between each story as they spin further and further outward in tie and space -- out to the very end of the universe itself -- and to the ultimate truth of human experience."
4,"""time please"" you know we can't serve any more...","Well the song Nothing Ever Happens is worth all four of the stars I have given this album.The rest of the songs are definitely worth listening to, but Nothing Ever Happens will for all time remain one of the best ever written."
4,Just a question,"I've been a fan since the first time I heard Kiss This Thing Goodbye on the radio way back in 1990 and I really regret not being in town for the only chance I ever had to see them live. I do have a question for anyone who owns this import edition: Has the sound been upgraded from the US domestic edition that came out back in the 90s? I have that edition, and it was so poorly mastered that the volume level has to be turned WAY up to listen at a normal level."
5,"""STILL THE BEST ALBUM"", EVEN AFTER 10 YEARS!!!!!!!!!!","A friend in collage introduced this CD to me during my freshmen year.Kiss This Thing Goodbye was being played on our local collage radio station. But that would be the weakest track of the album. The rest is neo-folk & rock brought together to make a pop sound that was truly original. Lead singer Justin Currie's voice sounds so american that you would never guess he was from Uddington,Glasgow. It is a shame that none of their other future albums could match this awesome CD. Buy it with no regrets!!!"
3,buy this for the one great song...LSD,"I appreciate this just for one song...""Lake Shore Drive"".I grew up in Chicago and the song, a spryly sang mixture of singer- songwriter rock with a tinge of bluegrass ruled the local, AM radio airwaves. It had a bit of taboo since the song's initials are L-S-D. Was this about driving on the lake front boulevard of Lake Michigan or a secret code to tripping on acid?This is about as rocking as this trio gets on this album. I only have an appreciation for ""Lake Shore Drive"" and the similar sounding, past paced ""Snow Queen"". Otherwise, this is a work for Midwestern collectors trying to replace their vinyl from the 70's"
3,"I really, REALLY like these guys, BUT ...","As a Chicago native, the song ""Lake Shore Drive"" has a very, very special place in my heart, so I'm glad to have it in my collection at long last. It's difficult to put into words what magical summer memories the song evokes.But ...The sound quality is abysmal on at least one cut on this CD: ""For Eddy"" includes an intermittent hiss that sounds like it was recorded directly off an LP. I checked - you can't hear it on the song sample here at Amazon.And the CD includes no liner notes of any kind. Surely *something* could have been written about this group's career.For those reasons, and believe me, it pains me deeply to do so, I give this CD three stars."
5,Very spooky memories.,This book was used as a bludgeon for many years by sadistic nuns who scared many impressionable children and made them mental. The absurdity of this book paradoxically drove many Catholic children into Apostasy!
5,Perfect Mother Goose,"I have one copy of this particular Mother Goose book. I needed another copy for my son's house. His daughter adores this book. I was so pleasantly surprised that this book arrived in pristine, practically brand new condition. I would definitely order from this seller again."
3,for a while not much happened...,"The acting is really bad so please do not expect to watch this and get real emotion...most of the emotion was rather flat and the pace is very very slow. Nothing seems to happen for a while. A group of friends go to a party, they drink, get stoned, hook up with a girl and pass out. The friends wake up the next morning and start driving home, more driving, driving in heavier snow while the friends perform a flat wooden dialogue. After a while the friends to pull over and eat...then they get back in the car and drive. Nothing much happens until they meet Ivan and thus ensues a predictable series of events. Yep, there is gore. No, there is not any edge of your seat suspense."
3,Indie flick worth a veiw,"If you keep your expectations in check, this might be a worthwhile rental for the horror fan. Three snowboarders somehow find their way to backwoods Pennsylvania during a snow storm and wind up in the cabin of a pair of hungry backwoodsmen (not to mention a few ornery townsfolk). This, of course, results in more than a few gruesome scenes, a brutal chase, and a race for survival. If you enjoy the exploits of rural cannibals, you know what to expect, and generally this fits the bill without any frills. The filmmaking and scenery is above par for a limited budget, and the scenes do provide enough realism to make even the most avid gore hound cringe. The acting, at best, is wooden, though the cabin owner does have a certain creepiness to him, and a brief scene in a local eatery is loaded with enough distasteful characters to whet you appetite for what is to come. You'll find few suprises here, but the film is a good reminder that big bucks are not necessary for cheap thrills."
3,Nice little horror flick...,"My mother in law and I watched this a few nites back. All in all, I probably wouldn't watch it again. But it was an ok movie. Started out great, then got a little to fake. Some kids wreck on a snowy road and end up at a cannibal's house. They over do the whole meat thing. I'm glad I watched it and it will remain in my collection. But not as a favorite. Although I liked it enough not to sell it."
2,Rather flat compared to other Southern Humor...,"Louis Grizzard would sneer. This book, although it has its funny moments, isn't as accurate a picture of ""Redneck"" humor/satire as the writer would portray. In fact, I found myself wondering if the authors had ever been to the South at all! Don't get me wrong; it's not all bad, but other books, such as ""A Southern Belle Primer"" capture the flavor these people tried to create much better."
2,Technical Difficulties,"I have tried watching this DVD however the disc itself has technical problems. When you put the disc in it makes a loud whirring sound and takes a while to start. Once it starts it freezes up often. I have looked into returning the DVD, which I can do, however they will not send me a new one. Amazon states that this is because it is being fulfilled by a secondary vendor (Newberry Comics)."
1,Very old culture,"I dont like to do BAD review, because every author always try to bring thr best they can, but some times the subject it's not agreeable, so , in that case finally it's a not good product."
4,Beautifully Made,This documentary explains to the lay person what the Tibetan Book of the Dead is about and how it is used. It also shows (I am sure) a rarely seen Tibetan death ritual and explains what happens when someone dies - from a Buddhist point of view. Very interesting and wonderfully filmed.
5,Positive for 3M lint roller refill,I am very pleased with the products I purchased & the delivery!THANK-YOU. John
2,psp gamers kit missing pieace,The psp pro gamers kit was all right but it is missing a peace it is missing the umd carrying case if you people would send me the umd case it would nice because i paid for the howle thing so i want ever pieace thank you.
2,Sony PSP Pro Gamer's Kit,"This kit is a great value for all the items you get inside. However, its difficult for children to return the cords to their proper place which makes it very difficult to close. Not really user friendly. I had problems too. Your better off with a small back pack or something."
3,does the job,"I had to pull out a divider to get my PSP to fit while still in its case. Also, the headphones suck and the charger cable could be more durable. It doesn't hold a ton of games, but if you are traveling, it is adequate to carry your favorites. Other than that, it gets the job done at a decent price. Bought it back in 2006 and the 'suitcase' is still holding up just fine."
3,"Better in the photos, but....","The main issue that I have with this case is not the case but the protective screen. IT SUCKS. It immediatly picked up lint and was rendered useless. So, I have no use for the protector.Next, the earbud. Only one earbud works. Thank goodness I have the included psp earbud.It does look sharp when you are carrying it around and when you open it it has an air of sophistication. I am glad I have it and not some silly nylon zippered pouch.I still recommend it to protect and to carry than nothing at all."
3,Not for grown ups.,"I dont know what I was thinking buying something as bulky as this product. I guess when I was looking at buying this I was set on protecting my PSP...which Ill give it that, the box is very durable and can handle a little rough handling BUT unless youre a kid whose already used to carrying a LUNCHBOX, Id look to something that doesnt resemble a cosmetics case. Also, the Headphones weren't very impressive at all(might as well have been wax paper)and were a tad annoying because they'll retract any time you move your head or the PSP. Its a swollen thumb down for the Pro Gamers Kit...sorry."
3,Can find better value elsewhere,"The kit did not contain the ""much sought after"" battery charger.Product is too pricey to recomend. I would suggest you look elsewhere for a better value."
3,You get what you pay for...,"This kit is pretty unremarkable. The case seems sturdy and the series of foam rubber dividers appear as though they will hold my PSP in place when it gets here. Outside of the car charger, most of the other components are just cheap bits of plastic, with little value, i.e. the ""Pro Gamer Squeege"" for applying your ""Pro Gamer Safe Screen"" is just a 2"" peice of cardboard with the words ""Pro Gamer Squeege"" printed on it.An important thing to note is that this kit does not include the ""popular Dock It station"" as stated in the copy. Unless of course that was also made of cardboard and I threw it out by mistake."
4,good case,awesome case everything else is garbage the headphones are crap the screen protector has bubbles in it and they dont come out the car charger is cool and the cleaning cloth is ok worth the price just for the case it holds lots of stuff and protects yur psp well
5,All you need for your PSP...This case KICKS *ss!,"I just got this kit for my PSP, and it's all I need! The case comes loaded with stuff, and enough room to carry the PSP, A/C adaptor, games, and this cool cradle called Dock-It that let's you sit your PSP at a good angle to watch movies. The bullet-proof James Bond aluminum case keeps everything protected and in one place so you don't loose things."
3,you dont really get what you pay for?????????,this is not even close usefull but the case alone and the UMD/game case and the space but really all the other stuff like the cloth its useless doesnt really work or should i say doesnt take of the finger prints like the on you got with the psp now thats a good cloth! the strap is useless cuz its too long the one you got with the psp is good but hard to get off and really i dont think its PRO at all this case is A ROOKIE or less like a BEGINNER case? i do not recommend it if you dont want to waste money do some research on some psp items like me except on this one i didnt cuz it came with the bundle but its just plain worthless and the other items like the screen protector and earphones dont really work
3,a must buy...,"because of the lack of any good games to play for the psp, you'll need a nice case to keep it stored in! sony blows!"
4,DARK TIMES FOR DARK THICKET!!!!!,"It was dark times during the Civil War. Owen Danforth is wounded and comes home to heal but he finds ""home guards"" or ""heal flys"" as the locals call them, trying to take over the counry. Owen is caugh up in it and has no choice but to join forces with the men against the ""heal flys"". Their leader is Shattuck, a man who will do anythng. He killed Owen's Uncle and tries to kill the rest of Owen's family. It is the story of people who hide, and wait for the proper time to take care of the ""home guard"". It is a quick read and the story line is very good. Kelton makes you feel like you are there."
2,IBM Marketing hype.,"I just started reading this book and it is already clear to me that it is nothing but IBM marketing hype. All authors are hardcore IBM'ers and it shows in spades. Page after page of ""oh how wonderful IBM is"". Give me a break.I intend to read some more but given the choice I would much rather have my $$ back and would like to buy an objective tome.Save your money. I wish I had.Roger Gordon"
1,Go Elsewhere for help,"Moser Wellman is an alchemist and she has used every other self help book to write this book. It is a book based on well worn concepts with a feeble attempt at reinvention. The concept once know as thinking out of the box is now known as the ""fool."" The only positive is that her book is better than her personal instructional seminars."
5,"ferret food, almost the best","I buy generic food carried by [...], I forget the big name brand that makes this identical to their name brand. Many hours of researh convinced me this is nutritionally best. Once, they ran out, and this brand was the next best and very easy to find."
5,Where's the bonus live tracks?,Just wanted to say there was (I THINK it was this album) a second LP included with the original release of this of Sweet performing live. What happened to those cuts?
5,VERY SWEET INDEED!,"Back in the 70's I was in a band called ACTION and we covered the Sweet song of the same name. We were all Sweet fans and actually got to meet the band and I have a photo of drummer Mick Tucker and me. The band was good when they were doing the bubblegum thing but were even better when they got heavier. I have this release on vinyl and I would easily recommend it. Tracks like SWEET F.A., SET ME FREE and HEARTBREAK TODAY lead the charge and the band is in fine form. These guys can rock! Their 4 part vocal harmonies were always superb and were one of the highlights of the band for me. In their day this was a very good band. I'd rather listen to this than a lot of the stuff that is out there today. R.I.P. Mick Tucker.www.electriceyes.us"
3,"nice, but not great","I took a chance on this album since the title and cover pic were so cool plus I was looking for some good train songs. It just wasn't what I was looking or hoping for. The vocals are fine, but didn't WOW me...could have been stronger and more clear. Not my favorite arrangements either. Overall, average, but not inspiring."
3,D'Onofrio the magnificent!,"This show and Vincent D'Onofrio have held me captive for many years. The attention to detail and well researched story lines have kept it interesting, Although I will continue to watch the many season reruns, I feel that the last three years were not as good as the beginning years. Not as much physical hi-jinks as before. Still love the show and cast and glad it had a long run. Like to see VDO in another series instead of the questionable movies he made during and after this show, in my opinion, not that it stops me from watching everything he is in. VDO is far too great an actor not to be doing A material."
5,criminal intent 8,"I'm a big CRIMINAL INTENT fan, but I suspect bringing in Jeff Goldblum was the beginning of the end for the series. I own seasons 1-9 on DVD. Jeff is an awesome actor, but his take on Detective Zach Nichols is, well, precious: I found this more amusing than objectionable in season 8. This is a first-class police procedural. @hg47"
5,Law & Order Criminal Intent Year 8,I have followed Law & Order CI since the beginning. It is a refresher to be able to view the entire season
3,Make Sure You Want This Kiss...,"Caleb is out and about late on a weekend night when he meets a fascinating young girl by the name Mae. Throughout their night together, Mae states that she is not like others and she will still be around when some of the stars fade away. This enhances Caleb's attraction to Mae and he wants to kiss her even though she resists. However, they end up in a kiss right before dawn when Mae is trying urgently to get back home. The kiss produces more than Caleb expects and it brings violence and death to his presence. Near Dark is an interesting story; however, it falls short in some aspects that hurt the overall film experience."
2,Not as good as everyone keeps saying,"A lot of reviews say this is a really good movie. I liked it alright, but it wasn't what I hoped. I like vampire stuff - whether movies or books - and this one took a little different turn on it. I liked that they showed some imagination, but it still isn't my favorite. I liked seeing a young Adrian Pasdar (Nathan Petrelli on Heroes), but I hated the vampire girl that he fell in love with. She was absolutely horrible. Other than that, not a bad movie, just not fantastic."
1,<Scenes Cut!>,"I LOVE this movie. I saw this movie for the 1st time a LONG time ago and was blown away! I rented it a couple of times, then it seemed impossible to find. When I bought my DVD player about 2 years ago, this was the 1st movie I tried to find. Almost 2 years later I saw that it was finally coming out on DVD. When I got it I called my husband and told him he was in for a real treat, I was coming home with the MOVIE. Within the 1st 15 minutes I became VERY aware that this movie has been chopped up. ALL of the blood, violence and gore that made this movie what it is was GONE! Yes, CUT OUT! Gone! The bar scene was butchered! All the scenes were cut, gone, not in the movie anymore. WHY?? Who did this to a classic film. I want to know who is responsible and they should re-release this movie with ALL of the scenes put back in!!"
4,Censored?,"I find it hard to believe that Anchor Bay would release a censored version of this classic, they always do such a great job. Can anyone else confirm or deny these comments?In the past, Anchor Bay released a double disc of Halloween that contained both the original and the TV versions. The censoring the previous poster described sounds like the Swedish version. Is it possible that the set contains both versions and she simply watched the wrong disc?I'd like to know what's going on before wasting my money. Anyway, great film, and at least I still have my VHS tape."
1,Yikes - Direct To Video Quality,"This movie is bad in the worst way. Not hilariously bad, or cheaply bad, but just poorly executed and uninteresting. I saw this for the first (and last) time about a year ago. It's on the same level as Starship Troopers 2."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this Blu-Ray at Walmart for $10, but the movie wasn't even worth that. It was a silly wanna be Vampire movie, they made better ones than this in the 80's so you can't blame it on the time. I love Vampire movies and usually even like the cheesy ones, but this one wasn't even cheesy."
3,the movie was OK,"I ended up getting online and shopping during this movie, I got inda bored with the whole vampire thing as it has been done to death at this point."
2,Capital B,"I have enjoyed quite a broad range of vampire movies. Some good, most bad. This movie was not bad. It was far from good though. Some of the scenes were good and pulled you in. However, Bill Paxton's character was putrid at best. If your bored and alone, watch it. If your with others, I would skip over this title."
4,Test of Time,"I saw this movie as a rental back in the late 80's. back then I thought ""it was just ok"" but now that I re-watch this again I am reminded of the story behind ""The Hitcher"" from the 80's and see that these movies have a great story to tell. No - there is not CGI or Hollywood Fame to really go with the cast - but none the Less - a good story and a return to true vampire lore in the sense of no fangs. This is worth the watch and more suspense then all out Horror!"
3,It will be on DVD in 2002,"Forget all that ""the film is lost, we'll never see it again"" mumbo jumbo. It was all a RUMOR.Anchor Bay Entertainent owns the title and will be releasing it on DVD in 2002. Their own web site has a banner ad for it's release!Just be patient, we'll get to see the vamps on DVD soon enough."
4,Cover???,What's up with this cover? This movie is not Twilight or anything like it. this is a genuine horror film!!
4,"Not bad, great all star cast","Even though it is somewhat predictable in spots, all and all it is not a bad movie. Adrian Pasdar stars in this movie, best known as the doctor on the series Firefly and in the movie Serenity. (The box also mentions he was in 'Mysterious Ways', I may have to check that out) The co-star is Jenny Wright, whom it says was in The Terminator and Aliens, although I will have to re-watch them and look for her as I do not remember the part she played.Supporting actors include Lance Henriksen, a personal favorite of mine, who delivers a great performance as usual, as the leader of the vampire gang. Bill Paxton is the really evil bad boy of the gang and plays his part well. Also, Jenette Goldstein is the other female vampire. She was also in Aliens and I do remember her part in there and wish she would have had a bigger part in here.If you are a fan of vampire movies, I would recommend adding this to your list of movies to watch."
3,"Great film, so-so blu-ray.","Near Dark is the best vampire film I have seen, it's not teen girl oriented like Twilight and it's not a cheesy horror film typical of the 80's. It just works well. The cast is fantastic with one of Bill Paxton's best performances and a terrifying Lance Henriksen as the head of the vampire family. You will not be sad you bought this film!ProsGreat film.Great cast.Great price.Not Twilight.ConsMediocre transfer, noticeable artifacts in the film.Packaging is the awful ""green"" blu-ray box. It feels cheap and breakable."
2,Slow,"Was looking forward to a fun filled movie along the line of lost boys, this movie was so slow, I couldn't even finish watching it!"
2,Nearly Entertaining,"Near Dark is not a good film. It's not a terrible film either, it just isn't very good. The acting was decent enough, and I'm sure that it was made for a fairly low budget, but the overall story wasn't very compelling or well-told. For one thing, this group of vampires have got to be one of the dumbest groups of vampires ever portrayed in films. You'd think that after living for 150 years or longer, you'd learn a few things such as, I don't know, maybe if you're a vampire and the sun will kill you, then you should look for a dark place to sleep at least a few minutes before sunrise, without waiting to see the sun appear? ""Oh no, there's that sun again! How did that happen?"" The vampires were caught in the sunrise more times than I care to remember.So, ultimately, can't recommend this one."
3,Not the Greatest Vampire Movie Ever Made,"This movie is ok only if you are bored and looking for something vampire-ish to watch. Otherwise, forget it. Watch The Lost Boys or From Dusk Til Dawn, unless you happen to be a major Adrian Pasdar fan. 2.5 stars."
1,Movie Great - Blu Ray VERY poor,"what is the person thinking saying this was a good transfer? This is THE worst looking blu-ray I have ever seen. I love the movie but like many others have said, this transfer leaves A LOT to be desired."
2,This is considered one of the best vampire movies?!?,"Having always had a love of vampire films, and considering the lack of quality in the majority of vampire films released in the last few years, I started checking some Internet sites to see what movies other vampire fans recommended. More often than not, Near Dark made the lists so I decided to rent it since it sounded like it had an interesting and unique plot.Unfortunately, the movie did not live up to the hype. While the plot was unique, it lacked depth. The characters were given shallow development and some parts of the story were just plain silly. There are two things about this movie that stand-out though. One is the great performance by Bill Paxton, he really knows how to play a villian and enjoy it. Second is the daytime gunfight at the motel which was really cleverly done. If you want a recent vampire movie that will blow your DVD player away, I recommend Blade II which was amazingly better than the first movie."
4,A Whole New Meaning for Beware of Strangers,"Boy meets girl. Boy kisses girl. Boy gets abducted by the girl's family and learns he is now a vampire. Not the best way to start a relationship? A gang of vampires travel from town to town, murdering everyone who crosses their path. Their youngest recruit, a lovely young woman, meets the man of her dreams in a small town in the middle of nowhere and turns him into a vampire. This starts the trouble for the gang as the young man's father pursues his son's abductors relentlessly. Complete with a surprise ending, this movie is well worth watching if you're a fan of vampire films."
5,Near Dark DVD,"""Near Dark"" came out the same time as another vampire movie,""The Lost Boys"".It was the better of the two movies,but got little recognition.Lance Henriksen did not just play Jesse Hooker,He was Jesse Hooker!This is perhaps one of the best vampire flicks around!"
2,The quality of this blu-ray is simply awful,"This is one of my favorite b movies of all time. I was really looking forward to enjoying a blu-ray copy of this film. What a disappointment it was to realize that Lionsgate has released a simply terrible transfer of this terrific film. Just about all my regular DVD's look better than this piece of junk. I only gave it 2 stars because the movie is terrific. Save your money and get it on dvd, for that matter a vhs would probably look as good as this piece of garbage. You have been warned."
3,Lots Of Future Stars,"While this is NOT a horror film, it is an interesting movie. Lance Henrickson, Adrian Pasdar, etc are a few of the recognizable faces in this flick. Pretty good for a low-budget throw together, as long as you are not expecting gore galore or fantastical images. Pop this into the DVD player on a slow night and you'll probably watch the entire movie before falling asleep. Not a rousing recommendation, but worth a few hours on a slow night."
2,Welll....,What can I say? It's a vanpire movie. To be honest... I did not finish watching it. It's certainly not Breaking Dawn.
3,Good old horror,"Lance Henriksen (Millenium), Bill Paxton (Aliens),great star, plus a good story about vampirism and great effects done a verry well done movie."
1,You have got to be joking,"I am a fan of horror and b-flicks and this ""cult"" favorite has nothing to offer other than a couple of ok scenes. A friend of mine recommended it and said it was one of the better vampire movies made. I disagree. Almost every vampire movie I have seen is better than this one. I don't care that it strayed from most ""vampire"" style movies...if it was executed well, i would have loved it. The characters just didnt do anything for me. The story was weak, the characters were weak, nothing pulled me into the story. I would never watch this movie again and I definitely wouldnt recommend buying this one."
1,Complete utter waste of time and money!,"I saw this and thought I remembered this from high school So we ordered it and only got through 30 min before hubby said turn it off. I asked why you wanted it. He said now watching it, it's corny, poorly acted, no plot, a complete waste of money. Guess memories are better then the actual thing!"
2,Mediocre by modern standards,May have been ok in the 80's but there are a lot better films in this genre.
2,Not much bite...,"I actually like most of the actors in this movie ... just, not in this movie. I do not consider it horror, because true horror has no happy ending--horror is meant to leave you feeling like the lights should be left on at night. I would catagorize this as drama, and not a very good one.To me, it failed in about every way possible. I really didn't give a crap about the characters, it didn't hook me. In fact, I stopped several times and worked on my college homework--because that was more entertaining!I kept watching, praying that it would get better ... in the end, I finished watching because I'd already paid to rent it and I might as well get my monies worth.It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, and a few parts were okay, but it's certainly not on my list of movies that I'd want to own."
2,"This is bad, at best","If you liked 28 Days Later or From Dusk till Dawn, then... do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie."
1,"Boy, what a dissapointment!","I liked Lost boys and I am a big fan of vampire stuff, books and movies. I really was looking forward to this but what a dissapointment. I fail to see why anybody would like this movie!? Somebody called this a horror movie... there is absolutely no horror what so ever."
2,Didn't receive the correct Disk 2,"I'll let others review the movie itself. Disc 2 was not the listed Bonus Features at all: I received a pilot episode for a TV show titled ""Profit.""The only thing this show has in common with ""Near Dark"" is the lead actor, Pasdar.This is a first for me: a completely different disc substituted within a DVD package. I'd replace it if I could be sure I would get the intended Bonus Features disk, but Amazon wouldn't want to open a DVD to check before mailing it to me, and it hardly seems worth the hassle if I should end up with the ""Profit"" disk again."
2,Horror!!!,"HORROR!!! Pero no horror de cine, horror de que no se que rayos me poseyo para querer comprar esta pelicula del 1987. Aunque me gustan las peliculas de vampiros, esta no es para nada una que recomiende. Pobre actuacion, efectos especiales de television de los '70 y no de cine, de hecho ni tengo idea si alguna vez la extrenaron en el cine. Espero que no, mucha gente debe haber perdido su dinero. Tiene actores que son muy buenos hoy en dia, pero parece que en aquel entonces, solo estaban aprendiendo. Mi recomendacion es que no se dejen llevar por la retocada caratula para hacerla lucir interesante y moderna, ni por su bien escrita sinopsis Realmente, no vale la pena la perdida de tiempo y dinero por esta pelicula. Espero que les haya servido mi reseña."
4,Near Dark,"Whatever happened to Katherine Bigelow? This is one of the best of her few films. Sometimes a bit over the top and it skims over some details (transfusions without the benefit of blood types?) but, it is a vampire movie, after all. Very stylish, gruesome at a times in it's violence and a fine score by Tangerine Dream!"
4,Near Dark,"Really a pretty scary and well-done movie with good actors. Unfortunately it came out at the same time as ""Lost Boys""' which overshadowed ""Near Dark"" despite not being nearly as good a horror movie. Lance Henrikson and Bill Paxton are hard to beat."
5,'Bout time!!,Wow...I have loved this movie for ages. It is about time they re-released it. It is a vampire classic! This movies shows a young country boy being lured into the big city life by vampires just traveling along...feeding. In the end...he finds love and a cure for vampireism. It isn't cheesy and has some really cool sceens. Like when the vampires cause some carnage at a bar. This is a MUST SEE!
4,Who coulda known,"...that this album would be a precursor to the whole lounge/downtempo music scene. I enjoyed it when it first came out in the 80s but it was a bit too mellow for my teenage tastes. Well, my tastes have matured and I have to say I can appreciate Hats a lot more now. Definately a soundtrack for an evening when you want to relax in a candle lit room with a martini overlooking the city skyline. If you don't have that view, then close your eyes because this music will evoke it for you.Pick up a copy and enjoy an early lounge classic."
3,Uncovered,"This cover is NOT heavy duty vinyl as advertized. It is a weave, breathable, lightweight blend of some sort. It offers no rain protection. I tried ""Scotchgaurding"" mine but it didn't make a noticeable difference. It fits well though and should keep the sun away from the parts. I was expecting something a little more heavy duty that offered protection from all of the elements."
1,False Advertising,"The item that I received is NOT the item that was advertised. As another reviewer states, this cover is NOT ""heavy duty"" and will NOT protect against ""rain"" as claimed by the listing.The cover fits my Generac 4000XL perfectly (24"" L x 15"" W x 24"" H), but that's the only nice thing I can say. The cover is a different color, different grade of fabric, and has different (less sturdy) stitching than the product listed.This appears to be a ""bait and switch"" of some sort, and I am going to contact both Generac and the seller and complain to both. I would hesitate to spend $10 for the cheapo lightweight cover I received. STAY AWAY!"
1,Disappointed purchase,This item is not sized on the web page to know how big it is. My 5 KWGenerator from Lowes is 6 inches bigger than the dimensions for this item.It was a gamble to buy it w/o knowing the dimensions for this item. I have to believe the dimensions on this are ommited on purpose.
5,There is only one PETE,Pete Seeger is a national treasure and this CD contains some of hisbest work. I highly recommend it.
4,As long as you get the right size ...,"Beware of the charts listed on Butler Creek's website. The dimensions listed don't match up well with the actual dimensions of the product.Once you get the right size, this is a perfectly adequate piece of equipment that can save you a lot of scope trouble in the field. I highly recommend them."
3,Adequate but narrow slots,"I purchased this toaster because I wanted a simple, small toaster to get basic toast from. It fits the bill, but the bread slots are very narrow. It works OK for regular, but not thick or long, bread slices. If you like to cut bread from a loaf, it doesn't work very well. You can't cut thinly enough to cram it in. Otherwise, it's good."
1,Dangerous,"If possible I would give this toaster zero stars. This Elite Cuisine toaster model ET-5W is dangerous, it gets so hot that it melts the sidings, and burns you if you touch any part of the outside of it. They need to recall this toaster."
1,You Can Do Better Than This,Pornography is ubiquitous. Good slasher films are many and often contain gratuitous nudity. The idea of combining a slasher film with a softcore porno is like putting a bunch of tiny grilled cheese sandwiches on top of a pizza. A pizza is nothing but dough and cheese. Slasher films guarantee gore and pornography. Why water down both genres as this plotless poor cousin to a film does? Either watch a real slasher movie or get a girlfriend.
3,So so,"Nothing outstanding here. A couple of the girls are attractive, all would be better looking without the tats and piercings."
5,"""The Boo Movies""",My Granddaughter can't get enough of it. She watches Season I and II over and over again. My husband has them both memorized! LOL
4,season 2 gets thumbs up!,"as my daughter loves this show, and we have the 1st season on my Prime account, i decided to purchase a few of the episode's of the 2nd season so she could check it out. as always she loved it.."
2,Groovies Final Grooves/Last Legs,"The Groovies made some great pop/roots/garage rock records which any lover of those genres is sure to cherish, but this isn't one of them. It's the last studio recording that I'm aware of by Cyril Jordan and sidemen and most of these songs are pretty lifeless. Just about everything is medium tempo Byrds like jingle jangle featuring way too much 12 string guitar, and numbing, almost monotone vocals. The writing is so weak that only the two cover tunes ""Sealed With A Kiss"" and ""Flying Saucers Rock And Roll"" are memorable, and both versions are pretty good in the Groovies tradition of being interpretors of timeless R n' R. Only get this if you find a ..... cut-out or used copy (I did) and you've already got everything else by them."
2,I like the shakuhachi parts best,I prefer the shakuhachi-music. That's very nice and fascinating. Other tracks are pleasant background music.
2,"Pretty, but...","It doesn't feel authentic to me. It seems newage. It's far too melodic for traditional Japanese music, and at one point I'm convinced I hear a harp. If you're looking for pretty sounds, then by all means by this CD. If you're looking for traditional Japanese music, I don't think this is it."
3,Lullaby Review,"I bought this CD. I was looking for the CD with Haru No Umi by Michio Miyagi, but this was all I found and picked it.Frankly, I'm dissapointed at the lack of traditional japanese songs, such as 'Aka Tonbo' or the much beloved 'Haru No Umi', and even 'Kimigayo' and 'Kazoueta'.I loved the way they did 'Kojou no Tsuki', it sounds haunting as it is supposed to be. I disliked how 'Sakura' was done, as we have sung a better version in my chorus class ;)However, I thorougly enjoy 'Umi: Sea Fantasy'. It sounds like something that'd be played at a festival. ..and I love the spooky yet sereneness of the shakuhachi in this piece. Overall, the CD is okay, and if you are looking for calm and serene japanese music to listen to or help you fall asleep (i listened to it last night to help me fall asleep), I'd recommend it."
4,Dramas,The drama was ok. It was a little weird but if you like weird it's a great show. Very sweet and loving.
1,Poor Craftsmanship,"Upon receipt, I was very disappointed with the quality for the price. In my opinion, it looks like it came from a .25 vending machine. Sent it back."
3,sony charger,"I am worried about the very hot batteries that are being charged ,I have other NM Hidride chargers For Rc planes and they do not get the batteries hotter than luke warm"
4,So far so good,Slow charger but has a automatic shut off for heat displacement. Think that is a great feature since my cordelss drill batteries wear out after 1-2 years from some quick chargers. Decent product. Have had it for the test of time though. Still new.
2,My turtle was super quick too...,"""Quick"" is a relative term.It takes hours and hours to charge the batteries. I was disappointed.Also it can charge 4 AA but only 2 AAA batteries. No idea why 2 more AAA clips couldn't be included.Bottom line is this is an OK charger but nothing special. I'm a bit underwhelmed given the description on Amazon."
3,"OK Charger, good Batteries",Charger works OK. Not the fastest and seems to not fully charge the supplied batteries. Maha charger is much better.
4,Looks are deceiving....,"I assumed the four holes on the bottom were indicating lights for each of the 1-4 batteries that it charges. I was wrong. These are only holes to let you see the battery being charged. The description doesn't say anything about these holes. I own a RayOVac 1hr charger whith a light for each battery, which I prefer.The Sony only has one light on the bottom to let you know if it's charging. However I did buy this charger for travel so I guess it will suffice. It's much more compact and doesn't have the large power supply like the RayOVac."
3,OK product but I doubted they ship the brand new one.,"When I got this item, it looks like being used, makes me feel not that good."
4,daughter loves it,My daughter is a battery user junky was an excellent buy for her if she keeps them chanrged
4,"Greet deal, excellent charger","This charger with 4 2100mAh batteries are a great deal. Its compact, light and easy to use. I like it."
3,"Charger good, all 4 of my batteries were bad","I've bought 2 of these, and recommended it to a coworker. She complained that it didn't work long in her (Sony) camera, so I checked them out for her. All 4 of the 2700 mAh batteries would not hold a charge for over 2 days (my older Sony and other brand 2300 mAh batteries were still fully charged after several weeks). I used a 2-cell flashlight to test various batteries along with my battery tester, and found that the batteries didn't compete with old batteries with much lower capacity, including older Sony cells. One of them even had problems charging in both the Sony charger and my Maha charger.So, check your batteries well, because it is impossible to even find a contact at Sony - I tried sending email, and got no response. Check it while you can still return it to Amazon.Try fully charging, then using it a week later. It should still have plenty of charge; if not, it's probably bad."
3,Great product but ....,"If you want to charge only AA and AAA batteries this unit does the job... If you need C, D or 9V, you will need to look elsewhere....Does the job..."
4,Pleased with the Purchase,I bought this item last week and I am pleased with the performance of this item. It charges quick and of light weight
4,sony battery charger,The batteries in my digital camera drain very quickly. The sony super-quick battery charger deals very nicely with this problem.
2,worked perfectly,I used this with an adaptor to recharge camera batteries on a trip to Croatia and it worked flawlessly. I would highly recommend this product.
5,Sony BCG-34HE4 Super-Quick Worldwide Battery Charger with 4 AA NiMH Batteries,It works for me! Its a nice charger does both AA & AAA batteries
1,Didn't work for me,"I also just bought this charger with 4 Sony batteries, and am confused. I thought the instructions said the light turns green when they are finished charging, but it never has. I keeps going off, then I jiggle the charger in the socket, and it goes on again. I have never had a green light, and when I tried installing them in my camera, it says they are half charged. All I get is a yellow light, or no light, and my camera never says they are fully charged. I've tried several outlets in my house, same thing."
5,Rechargeable batteries,Batteries worked perfect and were new in packaging as described. Fast shipping too - thanks!
3,"Price is Right, But Charging is SLOOOWWW!",Do buy this if you need the batteries and can allow plenty of time for re-charging. It takes over six hours to re-charge 4 2500mh batteries.
1,Good while it lasts,"This thing died on me after about three months, and I'd only charged about six batteries. Given all the great reviews, maybe mine was just a lemon?"
2,Charger works but the batteries do not,I had to buy some Duracell rechargeable batteries. The Sony batteries died after 3 charges. The Duracell batteries work great with the Sony charger. =)
3,"not so quick, not so ideal for travel","2700 mAh is more-or-less standard AA NiMH capacity these days.Batteries enclosed are 2500mAh. Good capacity, but not best.(see Maha Powerex AA 2700mAh NiMH)Charger titled ""Super Quick"" by sony takes ~6 hours (310min)to charge 4 batteries. There are ""smart"" IC chargers that take1.5 hours.Picture is somewhat misleading. Charger doesn't have individual LEDs per battery. Little holes seen on picture just make battery visible when it is encased in the charger.Package reads: ""Ideal for travel"" if so, they should've included plug adapter.Charger made in China, Cells made in Japan."
1,Cheater...Dont Buy this..Fake item,This is a fake product.. It's not original Sony..if u call n ask Sony they will tel you its fake...check it on Sony website..it's fake....mine's not even chargin the batteries!!!...i pee on this item and this seller
5,Incredible Batteries!,"I bought these batteries and charger for my digital camera, since my Olympus D-550 is a battery hog. So far, one fully charged set of Sony Ni-MH batteries have outlasted at least four sets of heavy-duty alkaline batteries and they're still going strong. I would not have expected these rechargable batteries to last this long, but they have.I heartily recommend these Ni-MH batteries for any battery hog, including flashlights, since the new high-intensity bulbs gobble batteries worse than digital cameras. These batteries are truly incredible!"
1,Do not buy!,"The charger is excellent, but you may want to think about getting different batteries. These batteries are complete junk and considering the power they contain, run out very quickly. I had this for a short while and purchased extra batteries and almost all are useless. I would recommend seeking an alternative product."
4,Good Charger and Batteries,"Charger is easy to use and relatively fast. It is only good for 2 or 4 AA's or 2 AAA's, but it does the job. Batteries are plenty powerful and seem to hold a charge well."
5,Great product so far,"The sony AA batteries (4 included) hold a charge well, as do the AAA batteries (not included; I bought energizer) that can also be charged (but only 2 AAAs at a time) in this unit. Many people say rechargeable batteries die much more quickly than alkaline, but I haven't found that to be the case... yet. I used two of the sony batteries in a flashlight that I accidentally left on for more than 24 hours -- and the flashlight was still blazing strong when I remembered to go get it."
4,Expensive but charge more for less time.,17 mins charge while i was having breakfast at a restaurant. my camera is ready for more shooting for the rest of the day!
4,great!,"great charger...takes a while to charge, but the battery charge is long lasting...perfect for a whole day's picture shoot"
5,"Great, just great","These batteries I call energy cells, I have charged them 3 times in the last 2 1/2 months and have emptied the 1g card 5 times, so you guys do the math. They last long and the charger is fast.I will update this after 1 year of use."
4,Oui for the Wii. Wheeee!,"We bought this for the ultimate battery-eater: the Wii. These batteries last far longer than alkaline and are a definite money saver.The charger takes about four hours to charge a set of four. The flip door comes off easily and I left it off to dissipate the heat (which I think will extend the battery life).The long charge is a pain, but they batteries last longer than any quick-charge battery I have ever owned."
5,A GOOD DEAL==,"I don't know that much about batteries, but this looked like a very good deal, [charging as I type]--Got a digital camera, needed rechargeable batteries, and with a name like Sony, could you go wrong?? Just hope there not manufactured in China."
3,battery charger,The Sony battery charger seems to work O.K. except that I wish that it would allow the batteries to be kept in the charger upon completion of being charged. I do not like having to take the batteries out and store them seperately from the charger.
4,Very good Charger,I have had this charger over 1 month. It charges the batteries as expected. I have no basis to compare speed.It does get hot but that's expected I guess. It shuts itself off when finished so I don't worry about it overcharging.I would recommend this to anyone
2,Charges 2 (not 4) AAA batteries,"Amazon's description for the Sony BCG-34HD4 charger is misleading. It can only charge 2 AAA battery (not 4 as described in item's description). It doesn't say it on the charger's package and I only found out about it when I opened the box. Now I can't return it. Please read other reviews before you buy it, don't make the same mistake I did.Otherwise the charger is OK. It's fast and small and easy to use."
5,Quick and reliable,"I bought this particular one because it will be adaptable to European and USA voltages.We burned out three chargers on the advice of our ""guide"".It is not the super quick one, but takes about four hours. Got this one because it will not minimize life of rechargeable batteries.Definitely recommend."
2,3 Hour Charger with short lived battery life,"I'm not satisfied with this charger. A buddy of mine has a rayovac quick 15 minute charger with a fan, and it rocks batteries out that last for at least 3 hours. With 2500maH batteries, I was replacing them after the first hour of intermittent photos. The second set of sony batteries wasn't much better. The charger and batteries were used in January, and not much usage since... and now I have 3 batteries that won't charge at all, only 4 months later.If you want longevity and better battery life - check out the Rayovac 15 minute with a fan."
5,Great Product,"2 words: Smart Charger. Other chargers will overcharge and damage you batteries but this one is just right.Batteries last a long time and I don't have to buy more batteries (bad for the environment).I use the batteries on my Sony Cybershot and it lasts a LONG time, way more than the regular Duracell.Good buy for sure."
2,"good charger, bad batteries","The charger is well designed, compact, does not overcharge batteries, works with AAA battries, and I vaguely remember reading that this charger works with other (non-SONY) Ni-MH batteries (Although I admit I'm too lazy to check this last fact before publishing this review).On the other hand, the batteries that ship with the unit loose their charge quickly. You have to charge the batteries the night before you use them. This makes them totally impractical. It's ridiculous to have to plan ahead 24 hours before you snap a picture with a camera.Instead, I would recommend:GE/SANYO eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable BatteriesYou can also buy it with a charger:Sanyo Eneloop 4 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargable Batteries w/ Charger"
1,charger & batteries,"Initial charge took about 3 hours. Batteries and charger got quite warm, maybe normal first time around.Looks nice and easy to use. Thumbs up.After using the unit and batteries for a while now I finally trashed it. Had to recharge everytime before using and batteries would run down in less than a week without use. Gave a full charge, checked voltage and set out on desk for 7 days and they died without even using. Wouldn't buy Sony batteries again, cheap $ store batteries last a lot longer. Wasted money . . ."
5,So Far So Good,"I bought this product shortly after christmas for my new digital camera. I have used that digital camera on numerous occasions, video taped many times with that camera, and have yet to require a battery change. My last battery set would honestly have required at least 3-4 charges by now and thats probably an understatement. Very impressed so far."
1,Carger is NOT as Advertised on Amazon,"Amazon Lists this Sony AA Battery Charger as being ""Universal voltage from 100-240V"". The product shipped however is for an input AC Votage of 100-120 ONLY. I specifically wanted the charger for overseas use. Since there was no time to re-order I was forced to buy a 240 to 120 Volt AC stepdown transformer so that I could use the charger on 240 Volts AC."
3,Super Quick ???,"If by Super Quick you mean 260 to 310 minutes for four AAA batteries, then I guess it is super quick. But that isn't my definition of super quick."
5,Long-lasting!,"Well, battery chargers just aren't that exciting. But, I can say this one has worked well for us for several years now. We've gone through several sets of batteries, but the charger keeps going!"
4,Good,"It's good. But it's no ""Super Quick"". Takes about 300 minutes for 4 AA size batteries to get charged. Lasts long, since it's 2500 maH."
5,A great moneysaver!!,"Have been using AA bateries for a long time and the use of them in my GPS/radio combination takes a new set every day I use it for over 6-7 hours. It takes 3 AA Bateries, Thes new batteries with the charger gives me almost 4 days of use. It will not belong before these batteries pay for them selves. I also bought extra batteries for the charger to always have spare ones to use. They also work very well in my digital camera."
2,Slow charge,Not nearly as fast as expected.......far prefer the lithium.......sold the camera because of this and went back to my Sony!
3,Decent but could be improved,"I ordered this charger to replace a 10 year old model which is no longer manufactured. While this charger does a passable job, it has a few design flaws. (1) the hinged cover is very flimsy and will come off very easily. This isn't any real big deal, as my old charger didn't even have a cover, but it's annoying. (2) the charger will charge up to 4 AA's, but only 2 AAA's (in the center slots). My old charger would do 4 or 4, in any combination. (3) the fold-out AC plug is mounted on the top left corner of the unit instead of being more centered. This seems to me to be a potential cause of breakage, since it isn't well balanced. Still, the charger is very lightweight and seems to work well so far. I haven't had it long enough to judge the performance."
5,I don't know how you could do better than this package,I've been using these for several months now and they work great. I use them in a Canon digital camera that takes all 4 batteries at once. They last really well and unlike other NiMh batteries these really hold a charge a long time.Can't go wrong here.
3,"Works as advertised, but not super speedy","I'd just like to add that this product works as it says it does, but too many people here are misleading. It's really not that fast, it takes at least a couple hours for my charges. You can get much quicker devices that support more battery types, have a similar size, and are just as cheap (look at Energizer)."
5,""" perfect choice! ""","i received this charger and batteries today- i was very happy with the design of the product- sleek, slim, and lightweight. charged batteries in the exact amount of time as was stated on the package. love the auto turn-off feature. very simple to use, and is capable of charging aa and aaa batteries. perfect size to throw in a purse to take with you, if need be. charges 4 batteries at a time so you can always have a spare set with you. i highly recommend this product- well worth the money!"
5,Necessity for all these cordless devices around,This thing is a necessity for all my cordless electronics. It looks good and works great!
1,Waste of Money,"this batteries don't last long even after they have fully been charged, ever since i've gotten them. i have them a little over a year now and they don't even work anymore with my canon camera even after it has immediately been charged."
4,Good one,This is a good light charger. I would like it if someone compared this with the LaCrosse charger! It charges quick and over the past month have had no issues whatsoever. One thing they dont tell you is that you cant charge more than 2 AAAs simultaneously. Good stuff. Definitely a recommended buy.
4,seems to be good..,"I read a few mixed responses about this product. Though I didn't get to use this too many times, I think the product overall is on the better side.Oh! BTW, prompt delivery too.."
4,A decent charger,I only recharge my batteries once a week at most. I find this battery recharger quite useful even though the cover is kind of flimsy.
3,Not good on 220V charging,"I took the charger abroad charged on 220 v, the batteries got really hot, it could have burned my hand if not careful. And it did not last long on that charging."
2,Started Off Great!,"I bought the travel charger and batteries along with an extra set of batteries for back-up. After the initial charge they worked great. Even after the second charge they were great. But, when I charged them for the third time one set would not take the charge. According to the charger instruction manual...I need to replace the batteries already...Really! I took them out of the camera when not in use and I charged them the length of time recommended. One set is still working (for now)...I'll have to look for a reliable back-up or replacement."
5,A little travel gem,"I am no environmentalist but I really am bothered by the little things in life that contribute to waste. I travel a lot and go through tons of batteries. They always seem to run out at the most inconvenient time.I recently bought this product and could not be happier. It charges 4 AA batteries at a time. It also can charge 2 AAA batteries and 2 AA at the same time. This works great as my MP3 player takes AAA and my digital camera takes AA.It is lightweight and does not take up much room, approximately the size of a PDA though a little thicker and more compact.The dual voltage works great in Asia where the majority of the plugs can accomodate a U.S. style prong or a Europe style prong. I would suggest you get an adapter in case you run into places that do not support the U.S. style prong.I admit I purchased this because of the Sony name. In general I have had no problems with the functionality of their products.Save money, Save landfills, recycle"
1,Horrible Battery and horrible warranty from Sony,The battery started to have very short life after 2 times' recharge. I called SONY at 800-222-7669 and they told me the battery has only 90 day warranty and suggested me to buy a new set of battery. They also said their battery has compatible issue with Canon camera. I wish they can provide this information on the product description.
2,Nice while it lasted,"The charger worked fine for 10 months, and now refuses to charge, and this was with only periodic usage at home. Disappointing."
2,JUNK product -- only works with Sony included batteries,"I own several AA and AAA batteries that fully comply with the specs of supposedly compatible batteries for this charger and it accepts NONE of them. It works 100% of the time with the Sony's, and 0% of the time with any other battery types I tried (AAA 200 mah, AA 1300 mah, 2000mah). I'm quite disappointed.If you're looking for a universal charger, look elsewhere."
4,Super-Quick Sony Battery Charger,"""Super-Quick"" might be construed a misnomer as the term ""Super"" would lead one to think ""Ultra"". It is not an ultra-rapid charger but it is a good product and certainly charges batteries within an acceptable time frame. The two very useful features are its versatility for use worldwide and light, compact build."
5,Pleased so far.,"Althought I do not have a lot of experience to compare this to, this battery charger has done everything it claims to do. Be sure and read the literature, because it does take the full time it states to charge four AA batteries. The first time I used the charger it seemed like it took a little long, but I was charging 4 batteries, and also I was anxious to use my camera. I bought extra batteries, so now I have spare batteries to use while I am charging the discharged batteries.It certainly is convenient with no cord to fuss with. So far I am very pleased. The batteries I charged held a good charge for what seemed like a long time."
2,About charger,My entire rating goes against the charger. It started not to work from about 1 month of me buying the same. Same thing has happened to 2 of my friends who brought this some time back. Do not go by the brand Sony as it is a complete luck issue.
4,Worth the money,This WorldWide charger is the best that i have ever used. I use this mainly for my camera. Nowadays I don't even bother to charge frequently.But a small drawback would be then can have provide AAA batteries as well in there pack so that we do not buy them individually.
3,Solid Charger,"I have tried 3 other battery charges and this Sony takes them all. It charges fast and thorough, plus hideable wall jack makes for nice storing.The only drawback would be the fact of only being able to charge 2xAAA at a time."
1,Terrible!!! Stay Away!!,"I saw the ratings, and I guess I was just unlucky, but it only worked once! And even then, it only half-charged the batteries. Again, look at the other ratings... I may have been unlucky, but know that it may happen.I switched to an Energizer charger that has worked great."
2,Save your money,"I might have paid for regular batteries. This recharged 10 times and then BUST ! It made this weird fizzing noise and since I didn't know if it was safe, I just threw it out."
2,Batteries Suck,"The batteries failed within weeks. Charger seems OK. Though not documented, the charger seems to charge individual batteries, instead of only grioups of 2 like many other chargers. The 1 failure light blinks if any 1 battery is bad."
1,sony quick battery charger with 4 aa Ni-MH rechargeable batteries,"From the time of receiving this product the batteries would not charge nor did a slot in the charger work. This item i ordered probably 2 years ago but i did not want to go through the hassle of the process to correct until i landed on this review. Therefore i rate the whole product as junk. Thank you, Ron"
4,Simply superb,"Very nice, worth buying. I tried some non-sony rechargeable battery, but it was awful. This is working great. The batteries last for about 2 - 2.5 years after which they stop maintaining charged enough"
3,Does what it's supposed to,"I was looking for rechargeable's for my Canon camera and I'm not that into the science behind batteries but I read the reviews, these sounded good so I bought them. I can take 200+ pictures with these before they need recharging. They seem like they hold their charge well enough as I usually get around 200 shots per charge. I bought these because I wanted a smart charger and for the batteries to last. The first charge with them didn't last long and I talked with a Sony representative who said sometimes that happens and to keep using them. I have been using them for two years now without issue and would recommend these to anyone looking for a good camera battery.Edit:Soon after the 2 year review, two of the batteries have lost their ability to be charged. Buy Eneloops."
4,"Not Super-Quick, but Super-Good for your batteries","Takes multiple hours (6?) to charge 4 AA 2500mAh batteries, not ""super-quick"" as the name indicates. (To me, super-quick means 15 minutes, or even 30, 60, or 90 minutes.) That said, the slow charging is critical to keeping the batteries in prime condition and gives them a rest from my 90-minute fast-charger that heats them up quite a bit. Not much heat off of the Sony charger. I've been charging in this unit the Sony batteries that came with it as well as Energizer AA 2500mAh and Duracell AA 2650mAh batteries, and a set of Energizer 900mAh AAA batteries. Problem with AAA's is that you can only do 2 at a time, but at least they don't take as long."
4,Good Product,This is the best product one can get at this price. The charger is reliable and the battery really lasts long once fully charged. My basic use is for music players and the product serving my purpose very well.
5,Sony AA battery charger,"Extra price = Extra quality. Fast recharge time compared to others and 4 batteries meant, I could recharge one set, while using the other set for my camera. GMVB"
3,"Started strong, faded fast","I bought this charger and 8 batteries in summer 2006 with my new Canon A 620 (takes 4 batteries). At first the camera took 1400 photos on one charge of one set of the batteries. In 2007 the camera took 400 to 600 photos on one charge of one set of batteries. This year (2008) both sets of batteries go flat one month after being charged, both the set in the camera and the unused spare set.Both sets of batteries have been charged 7 times so far. That's not a long life. Canon says their recharge batteries should last 300 charges.3 stars because the batteries have powered the camera for all 4,000 shots in 18 months.3 stars because I have to charge both sets every month now.I think I will get the Canon batteries next."
3,Works fine for most part,"I bought this charger and battery combo about a year ago. The charger works fine for my needs, takes about 4 hrs. to charge 4 AA 2500 mAh batteries. The charger gets hot during the process though.Initially, the batteries worked fine. My usage (digital photography, Canon S2 camera) was such that I needed to recharge them once a month. But after about 8 months of use I realized they did not run for long even after recharging. I thought maybe they have just lost the capacity to hold power. But to be sure I paid close attention to their behavior. If I charged them fully and used them after 5-7 days they would not last long. I then charged them fully and immediately used them (on a trip) and they lasted for almost 400 photos. That is about the same as how long they lasted when they were new. So, it seems these days they cannot retain power for long after a full recharge.I rate this item three stars because the batteries seem to discharge pretty quickly."
5,Great Buy,"Great Buy. Batteries charge within reasonable amount of time. This charger and batteries fit nicely in camera bag, making it ideal for digital cameras. Batteries can not be stored in the charger, so purchase a case for your batteries."
5,Excellent Battery Charger and Batteries,"This is an excellent small charger kit with 4 ""AA"" 2500 mAh Ni-MH batteries. Lightweight but sturdy. Convenient fold down plug. Automatic shut off indicator light. These batteries are top of the line. Sure, you can find higher mAh ratings, but not by much and not really necessary. In my Canon A570 IS, 2 batteries give me anywhere from 200-300 pics and 15-20minutes of video. In addition to viewing, framing, and downloading. In fact, with just the 4 batteries I've put off getting an AC adapter for my digicam, cause I really don't seem to need it with the longevity of these batteries. Overall, a very, very good product that I highly recommend."
3,Quick?,"It is called a Quick charger, but upon reading the instructions, a full charge takes 6-8 hours. Not quick by any definition I know of. It is light and small to fit in my camera case without any trouble. It works well for my needs."
4,Great Movie,"My three year old son loves this movie. It is my least favorite of the three Toy Story movies, but is definitely entertaining."
3,Stretches the limits of credibility,"I know that romantic suspense does not always appear believable but come on, are we expected to believe that the child of an attractive and successful socialite by an unknown sperm donor would not only be beautiful but brilliant and talented as well and the president of her own consulting firm by age thirty two. In addition when informed at age thirty two that her father (the sperm donor) is now the most successful businessman alive she not only embraces him, but offers him one of her kidneys, takes over as president of his multimillion dollar enterprise and falls for his protege. Although Andrea Kane always writes well this story stretched beyond my limits of belief."
4,Not that easy,"I really don't think it's that easy that someone calls you and tells you that your father -which you never saw- is dying and needs a kidney transplant and you just leave everything and go save him.In spite of that little problem you'll enjoy reading this book from start till end. You won't have any inkling who's the bad guy and that is very important when you read a book. About the love story, well... if you believe in love at first sight it's OK.If you liked this book you can read: Rider on Fire by Sharon Sala."
4,Very Good Read,"This is the kind of book you think you have all the characters figured out (who done it) and then you find later on they are eliminated. The story between the main characters, Sabrina and Dylan, ... keeps your interest throughout the book. The overall story line of a child from a sperm bank finding out who her father is and without any hesitation accepts this father, is alittle hard to accept. However, the overall suspense is worth the read. This is a great book to think you have all the answers, who did what to whom, and then you are pleasantly surprised. The only thing I would change would be to go into more detail about why the villian does what they did, i.e. attempted murder, murder, arson, etc. I can't wait for the next Andrea Kane mystery."
2,Stinks to High Heaven,"Wow, what a let down.Not a bad story overall. However, the characters are overblown to the point I really disliked them. Genius, superior olfactory sense, incredible business acumen and outstanding style. It was all repeated so often that the only character I liked was Dylan Newport. He hardly ever announced how awesome he is. Instant connections, deep rooted love in record breaking time. It was a flat story that never hooked me emotionally.Mundane, trite, phrases are repeated as well; 'tension so thick you could cut it with a knife', 'it was so quiet you could hear a pin drop'. Really? And not just once or twice.Although I have enjoyed some of her books I do believe I'm now done with Ms. Kane's works.Shelley Dawn, author ofSweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"
3,Not as good as other,"This books is not as good as I thought it would be. It lacks both romance and suspense. First of all, the relationship between Sabrina and Dylan is too abrupt. They went through half of the book without so much as a kiss or a romantic thought about each other, yet all of a sudden, they can't keep their hands off each other and fell madly in love. Doesn't seem real. In addition, there was really not much suspense in it. Too much focus on the characters' dialogues instead of action. I also felt that Dylan's character was overshadow by Carson Brook's in every way, from looks to power. Is it suppose to be like that? Either way, I didn't like that. After all, Dylan is suppose to be the leading male character and should be better. Also, the characters are too Two-dimensional. All in all, this book was a little disappointing. Though usually I really like Andrea Kane's books. If you haven't read No Way Out, try that. That one is a lot better."
5,Pastimes Review:,"This book provides a fantastic explanation of the things that human's do for leisure. The book describes how leisure has changed from ancient times, and shows the importance of leisure in contemporary society. This is a must for philosophy students and people interested in finding out why leisure skills are important to human beings."
3,Easy to read textbook,"It's a textbook, and seems really simple to read to the point of wondering why it is written. I wouldn't purchase for casual reading."
4,Received as expected,The book is in great shape for used with the exception of the bend in the book like it had been rolled up a few times in the past.Thanks!
2,Wish I Would've Known,"The book is in great shape, but I wish I would've known it was a lower edition book. I can't use the book in my class because we need the most current edition."
3,"Ultra Edgy, and a bit dated","Cited as one of Rolling Stone Magazine's ""Best 100 albums of the 1980s,"" The Feelies debut album sounds much different than their subsequent three studio albums. It is far edgier and more manic, and the songwriting is not nearly as consistent. They seemed more intent on generating strange new wave noises than writing coherent songs. The cover versions of The Beatles and Rolling Stones songs are particualrly glaring missteps as the band's style doesn't mesh with the material. Nevertheless, there are some good cuts here, particularly the lengthy title track, which is mostly instrumental and ""Raised Eyebrows."" ""The Boy With the Perpetual Nervousness"" is also pretty good once you get past the lengthy and annoying intro.Overall, this album's sound hasn't aged very well. In terms of quality, subsequent albums ""The Good Earth"" (particularly) and ""Only Life"" are much better bets."
2,some good songs,"one third good , one third ok , one third blows , thats the general view . once again one mans art is somebody eles crap ."
1,Second Thoughts,"Although I loved this album when it was first released, I now find it as interesting as listening to a metronome. Not a keeper."
5,I laught at those who give below 5,"How can anyone doubt the genius on this record? Come on people just listen to the thing and not just once and then throw it away. I HATED this album when I first bought it and basically wrote it off. As usual it turned out I was really wrong. The drum work on this album alone makes this album worth 5 stars. If you don't think the song ""Raised Eyebrows"" is amazing then just stop considering yourself a music fan. Oh and it also helps that the songs on this record are all extremely well written and there is not a dud among them. The lyrics are either extrememly funny or nerdy, but it just fits so well with the way the album sounds. It just sounds like they are a bunch of really nervous guys with a great sense of melody playing rock music. Here's hoping that this comes back into print."
4,AK47,I have owned this on LP for a long time; always wanted to buy on cd but it was too expensive. Now that it's been re released it's a must own. Side two is a little weaker than side one but side one alone is worth the price of admission. Fitting title.
5,This is the definitive Feelies album,"The 3 LPs that followed are all pretty similar to each other, and I'd argue progressively less interesting. Crazy Rhythms similarities to Velvet Underground are often mentioned, and whilst they're there, The Feelies certainly don't sound as though they were taking the kind of drugs Lou Reed & co were taking in the late 60s. I was introduced to this album by way of it being the soundtrack to the Susan Seidelman film ""Smithereens"" - and it's worth mentioning that The Feelies also had a cameo in ""Something Wild"" (some 6 years later). This is pop. This is moody. This is energetic & neurotic, and most of all it's layered with sensational percussion & rhthyms"
5,Another Green Whirl....,"In 1980 I picked up the 45 -- remember those? -- of Fa Ce La backed with Raised Eyebrows, and after a single play realized I had found a band that was charting its own course over a musical terrain laid bare by Punk and New Wave. A quarter-century later and the LP still gets me twitching with frenetic rhythm crazy guitar catharsis. Too good, too damn good."
2,Downer,"Although the quality of music is good, all the songs I got to were downers. I didn't get through the whole album because it was too depressing. I guess if you are already depressed you might like it but it just wasn't for me."
2,Adieu Misleading CD Concept,"Individually, the voices are as expected--high quality and pleasant. The lyrics and the overall tempo are another matter. The whole CD conjures a real downer attitude that doesn't change much from track to track. In short, it is not clear to this listener what the artists were trying to accomplish. The lyrics are not potent enough to yield sad or fulfilling feelings. It's just plain dull and pedestrian. It's a shame to waste such talents."
2,Five Stars for One Track,"The song ""Marie Mouri"" was the only good track on the entire album. It has a lot of feeling and soul. Truly well done.The rest of the album was flat, unimpressive, and way overproduced. Two really good singers overpowered by a bunch of musical(sic) prima-donnas.Coop"
1,"Sorry, Linda","I was waiting for the pure,sweet voice of Linda Rondstadt. I knew this could be a risky purchase because she does a lot of ""Art"" music. I was right, this Album is nothing but ""Art"" music. Half the songs are in French, and there is nothing in here that is even close to the Linda Ronstadt I remember. Keep your thumb on the skip button."
5,Wonderful album,"This is a wonderful album. Ann's and Linda's voices are right-on, go together perfectly, and harmonize beautifully. The song selection is varied, from old Appalachian ballad to newly composed Cajun, and they are all enjoyable. I lixten to this CD over and over."
3,so so,"I am a die hard Linda Ronstadt fan, but this was disappointing. I was expecting a more upbeat and fast paced zydeco music. I was not familiar with Ann Savoy."
2,It's not awful.,"Linda Ronstadt has such a warm, emotive voice and can do so much with it. I unequivocally rate her as one of the top five female pop vocalists of the last fifty years. I've followed her from folk to country rock to standards, Latin, lyric opera, adult contemporary, back to country and roots, and enjoyed pretty much all of it. But this collaboration just left me feeling like I'd wasted my money. You know, it's not bad: it's moderately lyrical and technically adequate. But there's just no life in it. It doesn't make me want to listen to it over and over again, and isn't that one of the qualities most of us look for when we choose to lay down our hard earned cash? Unless you're a die hard Ronstadt fan who has to own every thing she records(hmmm... sounds too close to home), I'd pass this one up."
2,...did anyone else notice??,"...did anyone else notice that this album is exquisitely sung, perfectly played, and terribly dull? I'm sure given the folks involved it will achieve much acclaim, possibly even a Grammy, but I can't help but lose interest when it is put on. No rough edges, no corners, no real rough-and-tumble soul. Just pretty pretty pretty. Please, if you do buy this album, buy the Magonlia Sisters' record CHER AMIS, too -- for a taste of the real thing. (The Magnolia Sisters are Savoy's awesome all-gal Cajun band)..."
2,Disappointed in this album,"OK, I'm not a big Linda Ronstadt fan and don't know her work that well. I heard her on ""Wait,wait,don't tell me"" on NPR and thought I'd try the album she just put out. It's a nice enough album but every song has a slow tempo and I found it a bit tedious. None of the songs ""called"" to me. I haven't had any real desire to listen to it again. If you are looking for slow ballads only, you might appreciate this CD more."
4,It's What it Is,"Linda Ronstadt is Linda Ronstadt is Linda Ronstadt. I think this just another one of her really good projects. If you like her, and you like the genre... It's a really good choice."
4,Great voice,"Linda still has a great voice. However, I liked her best in the old days with the Stone ponys(?). Much more rock in her music back then. She has become a more serious type singer now (nothing wrong with that either)."
5,delightful,"i love both ann savoy and linda ronstadt and this is one of my all time favorite cd's. I find it hauntingly beautiful. for those who are disappointed, i suspect you were looking for a more typical linda ronstadt type music."
5,Swept Away by 4.9.21.30,"I love this band and I love this album. I've seen these guys play a couple times and they rock. 4.9.21.30 really displays their talent as indie-emo-jazz-whatever...If you have heard Sto Cazzo and loved it - get this album. If you haven't heard Sweep the Leg Johnny before I say it is high time you did. It is often chaotic, but chaos inside a carefully constructed framework. The band combines heart-felt rhythms with haunting saxophone sounds from that sometimes whisper and sometimes scream. The vocals are minimal, but powerful. In fact, the album's moments of silence are as pleasing as the moments of sound quietly interrupted. If you don't find it to be dynamic as well as beautiful then you're crazy."
2,Pass on this one,The trivia that is included is so obscure that it becomes redundant. All about pop culture and very little about bowling.
4,Excellent crib set,We really like the color--light Navy color.It is 100% cotton as we expected.fit the crib set pretty well.
3,Leaves a liitle to be desired.,"This is a fine product for the price. The quilt is really cute and all accessories are holding up very well. However, the bumper doesn't tie at each corner, it does fall short at almost every side. The crib skirt is pretty flimzy and difficult to put on. But it's a pretty set and I think worth the low cost. Also, I wouldn't describe the blue as any variation of navy; it is much lighter, more like cornflower."
3,Not Satisfied but gets the job done,I bought this in a pinch. The comforter is not perfectly rectangular. It is lopsided. The patchwork is crooked. I think I may have gotten a messed up one but I paid just $30 for it so I cant really complain too much.
3,French mystery drama..,"when young lovers Marc and Lea journey to the remote countryside for a relaxing getaway in a secluded house, their lusty relationship takes an unexpected dark turn with grave consequences. Violent passion and errors in judgment combine to devastating effect in this erotic thriller."
2,Read this before buying!!,"I say read this before buying because I am not going to trash Memorex, I am going to explain what will go wrong and why. These discs should work for a while. Memorex used to be a very highly regarded name in fact. Recent Memorex releases have gone down in quality. I scanned and diagnosed some of these Memorex discs, and found out a few things...They have manufacturing label CMC MAG, the worst manufacturing label on the market. Memorex doesn't even make these discs! They buy them from CMC MAG and write Memorex on them! Some CMC MAG discs have gone bad and completely corrupted in less than 2 months! If you are using these for anything but temporary, stay away. The quality is good, while it lasts."
3,didn't work with Emerson EWR20V4,"These didn't work with my new DVD recorder. These may only work with recorders and burners that go at 8X speed. Mine goes at 1X, 2X, or 4X and these Memorex DVD-Rs apparently can't work at 1X, 2X, or 4X speed. I didn't realize that until after I tried these blank DVD-Rs."
1,Poor product,"I ordered these from Amazon.com upon their recommendation to use in my new Panasonic DVD Recorder. The first 8 disks failed immediately and the next 2 took a couple minutes to fail. After we closely examined the disks, we saw that each and every disk has little scratches that prevent it from being used in any machine. I would not recommend anyone purchase this product. I remember the days when Memorex was a top quality product --- no more"
1,Unreliable Product,"While using this DVD-R, I had success rate of about 66% to 75%.I did some research and found out some interesting things. First, I read internet posts describing Memorex 8x DVD-R media doesn't work well at 8x speed and that 4x is recommended for better result. So far this has worked. But this is very disappointing because this product is supposed to work at 8x speed.Another post I read was much more disconcerting, because the poster wrote his Memorex discs, which he burned months ago, was no longer working and that he lost large number of files.At this point, I'm considering purchasing different brand of DVD-R and backing up my files all over again just to be safe."
2,Nothing special here....,"It seems like most, if not all, of the songs on the Gods Of The Radio album sound very much the same. So if you like one track you'll probably like them all. It's regular 'ol alternative rock. They mix in some acoustic guitar and harmonized voices.To me the album didn't jump out as being anything worth listening to again. The songs SEEM very long and very repetitive. there are a few good guitar riffs here and there but they don't make up for the rest of the album.I think if they worked on their songwriting a little bit they have to potential to make some great music. But there are probably a hundred bands with CDs more entertaining than this in my humble opinion.With the chorus/catch line of the album being ""I'm tired of David Bowie"" I guess I shouldn't have expected too much."
5,Amigos.Vhs,"If you have seen El Super which is a Cuban Classic you have to see this movie, Ruben Rabasa does a Great Job,the movie is hilarious and if your Cuban you can relate to what the character has gone through like every Cuban,and how hard being A Marielito can be."
3,Mixed Bag Anthology,"I've come to the realization after reading several volumes of Robert J. Randisi's private eye collections that as the founder of the Private Eye Writer's of America, he is compelled to invite every author working in the genre to participate in his books, regardless of whether the quality of the stories merit it or not. ""The Shamus Game"" is another collection of private eye stories in which the best inclusions (Loren Estlemen's Amos Walker, Bill Pronzini's ""Nameless"" Dectective) make the lesser lights look worse by comparison."
3,INGENUE DAVIS IN HER FIRST VAMP ROLE!,"""Cabin in the Cotton"" could have been a powerful screen story, but this adaptation from the novel left much on the cutting room floor. Davis is well-cast as a rich southern flirt who toys with the affections of the poor son of a share cropper Barthelmess (who works a the store owned by Davis's father). Davis is vivacious and luminous in her scenes which include singing ""Willie the Weeper"" This is the movie in which cotained Davis's all-time favorite line:""Yur'e cute!-A'hd luve ta kiss ya but I jes wash'd ma haya!"""
3,Not Bette's best.,"If you're looking for great Davis flicks, keep looking. This film is OK, but Bette was an ingenue at the time and her role was quite limited."
4,A REAL Folk-Goth Band,"I find this album very intriguing. It's a French folk-classical Goth band that sings in English. All the tracks run the gamut of their sound, with acoustic and arena rock sounds and a gothic background. The lead singer is female, and has a haunting whisper voice that becomes full bodied in some tracks. There is also a female background singer who adds to the songs a haunting melody, and a male lead for 2 tracks. Consider if Entwine had Ambeon's lead singer and you can sort of understand their sound if you've never heard them before, or otherwise just take a metal goth band and bring down the noise and tempo by 3/4ths and you have this wonderful cabaret-like goth band."
3,I was expecting more,"This was a fairly interesting and quick read, but I have to be honest, that I was expecting more. The tips for gaining speed were interesting and helpful, and his way of writing was, again, easy and approachable. He doesn't ever make you feel like you can't achieve your goals. The one thing I was hoping the book would include was some sort of training plan on how to get me down to a specific race time. I guess it would be pretty difficult to tailor a plan specifically to me, but I was looking for something a bit more substantive."
2,Not for the experienced,"Not a bad book, only very easy read. I expected a bit more. The book can absolutely be good enough for the beginner."
4,An early argument on behalf of rational voters,"A wonderful little book. This was V. O. Key's final volume; he died before it was published. Perhaps it is most famously summarized by his quotation (Page 7): ""The perverse and unorthodox argument of this little book is that voters are not fools."" In short, something like a populist work on voting behavior.Throughout the book, he uses a variety of data--adopting very simple statistical techniques--to develop this point. For instance, he shows that voters who support one party in an election and who then become dissatisfied with that party after the election tend to switch their votes at the next election to the other party. Thus, voters are not Pavlovian dogs, ritually supporting the same party over and over.All in all, a classic little book. It is still worth rereading a half century after its publication."
5,Interesting little book,"Published posthumously, this is Key's response toThe American Voterand the debate at the time over the competence of the American public. The first chapter includes his famous quip that ""voters are not fools"" and is the most useful portion of the text for the contemporary reader. The remainder of the book is empirical evidence (mainly from surveys) and some unfinished thoughts on the subject. A quick and worthwhile read."
1,Not his best work...,"I've listened to many Brian Tracy programs over the years, and was very hopeful when I saw this one hidden away.The only reason I gave it ONE star is because Amazon won't let me give it ZERO stars. This is just not very good work. He repeats himself multiple times, paraphrases and re-states the same ideas, and frankly the suggestions for increasing your learning potential just aren't very good.Don't waste your money on this one. Stick to the motivational techniques he teaches in other programs and apply them to your own learning. 90% of learning something is WANTING to learn it in the first place--there aren't any shortcuts or tricks.UPDATE: I guess there are some die-hard Brian Tracy fans out there. Of all the reviews I've ever written, this is the only one that ever got a thumbs down! The truth is the truth. I calls them like I sees them! This program is a waste of your money and--more importantly--your TIME, and Brian Tracy claims to be an expert on time management."
5,"Good product, good price, works well for my needs","I broke the tank on my earlier model Hunter humidifier, so I was looking for either a new tank or a new humidifier. The replacement tank would have cost almost as much as the whole unit, so the choice was obvious. I have another very similar unit, the new one upstairs in the bedroom and the other older one downstairs in the living room, between them they do a good job of keeping the whole house humidified in the winter."
1,"""Care Free"" - I think NOT","Yes, it puts out the moisture effectively. That will warrant one star. Aside from that it is loud & big. But my biggest complaint is the gunk that builds up in the inside. I cleaned the water tank and base daily, but the motor area has gotten this build up on it after a month of using it that is impossible to get off. Even with bleach. It looks like a white crusty film. GROSS. I even tried bleaching it with no luck. Don't buy it and risk getting ill from the bacteria that builds up in it."
2,Fan only operates on low,"when I run it on high and the tank is full, water begins to splash on the fan blades -- which must be dangerous. Runs fine on low speed."
1,Tried to enter 1/2 a star and can't,We were given this as a gift...like others stated..GREAT at FIRST. Only lasted through one WINTER. Then just SIMPLY died. I would NOT recommend for the $$$ it should at the very least last several years!
1,Good for a while,"Like others, we were very pleased with this humidifier at first. But after a couple months, it began to leak...A LOT. We tried everything to remedy the problem. I thought we must have simply gotten a dud, so we bought another since it had been so great at the beginning. This new one began to leak ever faster and then just stopped working at all. Very disappointing."
2,It rattles loudly,"Amazingly, the fan rattles loudly. I'll put it back in the box and go to the inconvenience and expense of shhipping it back."
3,As Expected,"The only complaint I have is the noise of the motor when the unit is on HIGH speed. Other than that, it is just about what I expected for the price and it does what it is supposed to do."
3,The dry air helper,I have an idenical one of these I bought years ago and love but it started making a noise in the fan and low and behold if this one isn't doing the same thing. So right at the moment I'm not really recommending them because they are way to noisy.
1,Piece of garbage,"Initially, the first month, it worked well. Then it was recalled by Hunter because of a ""fire hazard"". The company never sent a replacement or followed up on several of my calls. Like an idiot I bought another one from the same brand. It worked well for a month. After that, it started leaking, I mean big time. After two floods on hardwood, we threw the piece of garbage away. I will NEVER AGAIN buy anything made by Hunter."
2,"Sorry, threw both of mine out....","I had two of these units for two winters. They definitely increased the humidity in both rooms, including our bedroom. But last year, I started feeling congested in the morning when I waked up. I thought I was coming down with a cold. But it happened repeatedly. Finally, I tried not using the humidifier. Bingo.... No problems. Went back to using this unit and the same problems happened again. I think this ""Permawick"" technology may help prevent build up on the filter, but for me, it seems like the bacteria and allergens were not affected at all.BTW, I switched to an Air o Swiss model just two weeks ago. It claimed to have several layers of protection against mildew and bacteria. So far, so good. I reviewed the product separately."
2,Good at first but did not last,"We owned this product for less than a year. At first we were satisfied, but within a few months of purchase, it stopped working. I would not recommend it to other people."
1,"Do NOT, repeat NOT, buy","This humidifier is a real lemon and the company knows it because you cannot get anyone to answer their 800 number or the 901-248-2222 number at their Memphis service department. I bought the unit just before Xmas and it only worked for a week or ten days before it started short cycling (ON for 15 seconds, OFF for 15 seconds. After carefully following the instructions in the owners manual I plugged it in and reset the cycle time to 3. I turned on the fan to high and it ran for about 15 seconds and quit. Two more attempts to follow the instructions resulted in the same experience. I now have no humdifier and cannot get the attention of the Hunter Fan Company. I am cancelling my order with Amazon and letting them handle the problem. I wish them luck while I buy another company's humidifier."
1,Greatly dissapointed!!,"The Hunter #34352. 3-1/2 Gal Humidifier was a total bust. Opened up the box, filled it up with water and the fan blade was off center, the racket was terrible. I thought if I was buying a Hunter, I was getting the best. Then I saw where it was made--CHINA. [...]"
1,Defective right out of the box,"Just took it out of the box and set it up for the first time. It's broken right out of the box. The humidistat is defective and will not allow the machine to turn on. My dry-as-the-desert apartment has an actual humidity level of 25%, but the humidistat on this machine claims the air has a greater than 80% humidity level. (If my apartment had 80% humidity in December, I wouldn't be buying a humidifier!) The machine is designed to only work through the automatic humidity setting -- you can't just turn it on and off. So there's no way to override this error.Now I have to go through the hassle of re-packaging it and sending it back -- and paying for the shipping! Thank you Hunter, for the hassle, expense, and inconvenience. Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere."
1,This humidifer is horrible DO NOT BUY IT!!!,"I purchased one of these and it does get nasty, slimy buildup and gets disgusting. It quit after one winter and they replaced it, but that one quit after only a month!"
5,Belated tribute to an ignored great,"The ranks of fine jazz musicians who never received credit for their contributions during their lifetimes are unfortunately large. Herbie Nichols' life offers testimony to the fact that talent doesn't always dictate the course of a career. This wonderful pianist was all but ignored during his life. Fortunately, Blue Note recorded this set of music, which provides all of us the opportunity to hear what was missed the first time around.Nichols' pieces revolve around subtle vamps, unexpected Monk-like angularities and dark, swirling melodies. While the influence of Monk is there, Herbie's music is completely his own, and like Monk, he crafted compositions that are unique, self-contained worlds. He just doesn't repeat himself. The music here is satisfying on each and every listening.For a fine review of and comment on Herbie Nichols' life (and the difficulty of pursuing a life in jazz), pick up A.B. Spellman's book, ""Four Lives in the Bebop Business."""
5,Shuffle Montgomery!,"I myself never heard of Herbie Nichols before 1998, but once I did I was appropriately impressed. His music seemed ""easy"" to listen to, but it wasn't; Nichols' melodies were angular, jutting against each other sideways rather than in a linear fashion. One of the other reviewers here expressed surprise that Nichols' music isn't better known, but great art is never very popular. Alfred Lion of Blue Note Records, who recorded these sessions, was amazed that they didn't sell well because he loved the music and believed in it. But don't take my word for it - get this album, as well as Buell Niedlinger's ""Blue Chopsticks"" and the Herbie Nichols Project's ""Strange City"" to hear one of the most original voices in jazz."
4,Good resource,"This is a good cookbook - one I appreciated finding since there aren't many japanese vegetarian cookbooks out there! First, the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 ios because I really like to have more pictures when it comes to ethnic cooking. It not only gets me interested in trying new things but also gives me ideas for presentation. This book only has 8 pages of pictures. But that aside, the recipes are tasty. Some of the ingredients are hard to find (like the specific types of seaweed) but if you have an asian store near you'll find what you need. I've found some things on the internet too (the world at your finger tips!) I recently bought a deep fyer and am looking forward to trying out some of the deep fried tofu recipes. You need to like tofu I think to get the best use out of this book since there is a lot in here. I recommed it though - fun to experiement and try new things."
3,no pictures,"This is a nice book with many nice stories about the japanese traditions and eating culture. The recipes sound easy to make. I would have given it 5 stars had there been more pictures in it. The important part of japanese food is the how the food is being presented, I was hoping for a book that whould give me more inspiring ideas on how to present it on the table. But for only a few pages of pictures in the middle of the book I find that the book lacks inspiration but it is very informative."
2,Stock issues?,"I ordered the book in March of 2006, and every month I was required by Amazon to approve a delay. It's July and still more delays.I only mention this because while the experience may be unique to me, you might want to reconsider ordering it as a birthday gift or other time-sensitive occasion.This happened to me with another cookbook, and another customer reviewer mentioned long delays in her review, and I found it helpful so I thought I'd mention it with this one."
5,The Best Bra Ever!,I'm a 34 D and this bra has great support and its lasted for a year and is still my favorite

Woman7. Got To Get By8. Say Hello9. Where Angels Fear10. Without Your Love11. A Perfect Love12. Say A Prayer (Remix)
5,Wonderful CD,I'm an 80's fan. Breathe was one of those great singing groups of the 1980's and early 1990's. David Glasper has a fantastic voice and great songwriter. Hope you enjoy this. I highly reccommend. David Glasper has hit a few bumps in life like we all have experienced but he is singing and songwriting again. Look him up on a search engine and check out his videos. He's in Thailand and a friend is helping him up put together an album. Stay tuned for him to resurface.
5,HILARIOUS VIEWS FROM FLEET STREET,"""Just make it up "", said new Yorker writer Brendan Gill to the author of this book .Following Gill's advide , the Fleet Street celebrity lets us have a view of American journalism as if it was penned by P>G> Wodehouse's Psmith,Journalist . Chancellor's picture of celeb editor Tina Brown is so funny you may need to loosen your clothing before tacking it .He makes no adjustments for American readers.Chanceller views some American institutions such as fact checking as jokes . Hilarious job for those who need to know what the Brits think of the American press ."
3,Miracool neck cooler,It's supposed keep you cool for up to days. your lucky if it lasts two hours. I bought two dozen so I could give them to my employees that work outside. It doesn't help with the heat long term.
4,Works great,I bought this for a soldier friend who is serving in Afghanistan and he said that they work great. It's a great buy and would be great for a care package.
2,Can buy at dollar tree!!!,I had these sent to my son who works in a warehouse with no air. He said they really did not work...at all. Then a week later I find the exact product at Dollar Tree.Boy do I feel bamboozled! Save your money on these. Go to your nearest sporting good store and get Frog Togs!!They are awesome! They get freezing cold and do not leave your skin or clothes wet. P.S. I bought the Dollar Tree product myself to see if maybe my son did not activate the cooling beads or work them into the path along the headband properly.I did and it still only cooled (barely) for about 5 mins plus left my forehead damp. YUCK
5,great relief from heat!,"I have Parkinson's and heat is really disabling to us. I gave these to alot of my friends and they love it, as do I. Really helps keep me cool. Thx!"
5,A Combination of Doris Day and Peggy Lee,"Janet Seidel is an outstanding Australian Singer, very well know down under. I have two of her CDs that I bought in Singapore and am hungry for more. She just sounds good. If you listen cloesly, she sounds good. If its in the background, she sounds good. I own an Inn and over and over guests will ask me ""who is that?"". This album is a compilation with many of the same songs as on her ""Midnight Jazz Lounge"" albums. Unfortinately Amazon is gouging us on this at $36 a pop. Her other albums (and there are many)go for about Sing$ 25 in Singapore, roughly US$ 16, and I know if doesn't cost twenty bucks to ship it in from Oz. My CDs have been played so much they are starting to skip but I'll hold off a little longer."
2,Not what I was looking for,"This book was definitely not what I thought it would be. I teach Geometry in New York State, which is a rigorous Regents course. (10th grade). This book was not organized in a way that you would think. The different topics were randomly placed and many of the activities were either too easy or too difficult. This book was of no use to me. I had to return it."
4,Good collection of guided visualizations and more,"This exciting new book from Yasmine Galenorn includes 22 meditations based on each of the Major Arcana cards of the Tarot. Although each visualization focuses on mainly one aspect of each card, Galenorn gives you a lot of clues on how to write your own in case something is not covered. This is a very thorough book, which demands a level of commitment to be fully enjoyed, and although it will be suitable to tarot novices, I would recommend it to someone who's already acquainted with a deck or two. It doesn't include info on divination, but it does your tarot skills as a secondary result. The only reason I didn't give it four stars is that I expected the CD to contain all 22 visualizations and it only contains two of them. I would love to see a book on the Minor Arcana and/or a book on divination from the same writer."
5,Awesome guide to college for girls,I find that this was really helpful and also extremely cool since it was all girls in college writing about what different colleges were really like for them.
2,Disappointing and superficial,"I was expecting a more balanced, measured look at the pros and cons of different types of colleges. This didn't do it. Example: the essay about going to a large state university paints the whole experience as lonely, alienating, and anonymous. The writer complains about the 20-minute walks from dorm to classes(other people might find this useful for thinking and in keeping fit), the throngs of girls she's too shy to make friends with, the communal washing machines in the dorm. She wants to go home and spends as much time as possible in her bed. A counter-essay from someone attending a different, more cosmopolitan large university (Berkeley, maybe)-- someone who LIKES going to a big school--would help identify positives as well as negatives."
5,Prompt replacement of item lost in transit.,"This seller is unique. When I let him know the book I ordered did not reach me days after the expected date of arrival, he promptly sent me a replacement that reached me safely. He or she is a person I will not hesitate to do business with again anytime any day."
2,Wow,"It's amazing that a book about ""the art of wondering"" can be so steadfast in the way it presents ideas. The author presents his viewpoint as fact throughout most of the book, and since my professor uses the publisher's handouts as in-class assignments, these viewpoints are the only acceptable answers to the questions posted.The layout is very distracting, with quotes (usually 2-3 per page) scattered throughout the margins of the text.The only thing I got from this book is an affirmation of my motives for waiting until my last semester to take my humanities elective."
2,Disappointing conclusion,"I have a 2 year old son and am hoping to conceive a girl this spring. We didn't practice any gender selection techniques with baby #1 since it didn't matter on the first. We just, shall I say, worked on it nightly. I would love to increase my odds of having a girl this time and am reading everything on the subject I can get my hands on. I was excited about this book at first. She spends a lot of time on the history of pre-selection and telling how all other methods are wrong. But the few chapters that there are on her method are very vague and don't go near into the detail that she went into about the other ""wrong"" methods. This is the only method I have read that says boy days are 4-6 days before ovulation. I am very skeptical and do not plan to use this method. I would love to hear from anyone who has used any method successfully and those who have not been successful with certain methods."
1,You will be very disappointed if you use this method.,"This book describes a sex selection method that is the complete opposite of methods that are proven to work. We used the book ""How to Choose the Sex of Your Baby"" by Dr Landrum Shettles. We first used it when trying for a boy and we had a son. Then we used it when trying for a girl and, sure enough, we had a daughter. We now have the two children that we always wanted. This would not have happened if we used Dr Whelan's book."
1,Boy or Girl?,"This book did nothing but confuse me. The author spent so much time talking about all the ""usless"" theories that when she started describing the method she belived to be true, it contradicted everything else I've read and heard and I had no idea whether she was going to disprove her own theory. This book is a waste of time."
1,Disappointed and Confused!,"This book is very confusing to understand ! The writer contradicts herself again and again. By the time you finish this book, you're not sure what you should and should not do. If you really what to know, read How To Choose The Sex of Your Baby by Dr. Landrum B. Shettles and David M. Rorvik."
4,The easy way to wealth,"The book title says it all ""Wealth without worry"" easy to undestand,plenty of references and back-up data. Wish I had known about this system 20 years ago !"
3,"Very nice for Hi-8, but go digital.","This Samsung is a very good camera for the price, but somewhat dated. Since there is no USB connection, you can not record DVD's of your images on a computer. Go ahead and get a Samsung Mini DV model and you'll be much more prepared for the future. By the way, these are made in China now rather than Korea."
2,Drives me crazy,"Let me tell you about the Camcorder. The truth about it. This camcorder is not worth your money. The battery allways dies so quick, and there is no way of this camcorder to be hooked up to the computer! Even if you where to purchase any extra parts. If you are looking for a camera to just hold and claim you have a camera, its a good product to get. But if you really want to use it more then once then i suggest not to get it."
3,video man from Cleveland,"This camera is not on sale anymore. Get it at Radio Shack for the same price plus personable customer service. An OK camera, however."
4,Nick Holder - The Other Side,"On THE OTHER SIDE, Nick Holder seems to be exploring different avenues... at first. ""Player 1"" and ""Back Again"" are more much downtempo than his other work, and although they're an interesting change of pace, they don't quite distinguish themselves (even with the sounds of Galaga coming at the end of the former). One we get back into house territory, many of the tracks, although excellent, seem to be retreads. ""Magic Carpet Ride (Paradise III)"" calls to mind the tribal rhythms of Holder's classic ""Sambafrique"" off FROM WITHIN, while ""Bad Girl"" is sample-based jazz similar to ""Singing."" ""No More Dating DJs,"" as humorous and female consciousness-raising as it is, has its political spoken-word roots in ""America Eats Its Young."" Still, Martin Luther King, as transposed into the beat of ""The Dream Lives On"" is nonetheless rousing, and the production throughout is crisp as always. So nothing groundbreaking, but still strong and competent."
2,don't have one,"I recieved my meter quicker than they said but was dissappointed that it didn'tlook nothing like the picture. Different color, and a lot smaller. It was less than5 inches long and the add said 9.3/4"". Just about half the size the add said and awhole lot cheaper looking than the picture. The 60.00 dollar list price must of been someone's April Fool's joke. It really isn't worth the 29.00 and the shipping madeit even worse of a deal."
2,NOT what I had hoped!,"This was not what I had expected, and I was disappointed at the performances. Ive heard better players play the same songs, and usually I do not agree that anyone can top the original player of a song, but I felt like there was not enough energy in the way these songs were played, and it sounded kind of sloppy, and rough, rather than concentrated and smooth."
4,Purchased for someone else,"I have not listened to this cd....therefore, I can't give it a fair rating. I purchased this cd to be included in a gift basket at a flamenco show...."
2,"Fomulaic, flat and better material elsewhere","I saw the movie Vicky Cristina Barcelona, and was entranced by the Flemenco guitar songs. Shopping on Amazon, I bought this. It's authentic, but uninspiring. Woody Allen did a great job selecting music for that movie, so while there are only 12 songs on the soundtrack, the vast majority of them are superior to those here. Also, there is a very affordable Essential Guitar CD of 33 Guitar Masterpieces which, while not all Flamenco, are more diverse and enjoyable than those here."
3,Masters of flaminco guitar,Not as good a sound quality as I expected. The music is unimpressive in variety. It sounds like artists showing their skills not making music.
3,Hardcore,"I bought this set because I'm a big fan of Jesse Cook. What I quickly discovered was that most of these works, though they are complex and unique, just aren't good background music material. Jesse Cook actually has some circularity to his music, so that each song feels like a complete and satisfying piece of music. However, the songs in this set feel like jagged glass in a jar--they don't mesh with each other, and they don't express a complete musical thought. I found it very distracting to try to listen to it as I studied or read, so for me, it was a wasted purchase."
5,Masters of Flamenco Gutiar,"This was a gift, so I sure they are happy with it.I am happy with your quick service and promptness.thank you"
4,This album is for musicians,"I am a big fan of flamenco, but I am not a musician. I still like and appreciate the music in this album, but I think it is for musicians who can understand the skill."
5,Can't wait to get on Board the MAC WAGON! Read inisghts before you buy,"I am not going to place a full review on this since I am still waiting for it to arrive! What I can say is that being a Wintel Veteran, one needs to do a little reading b4 making the jump. Plus expect to have a co-existence with your Wintel platform until u feel comfortable with the switch completely. Get this book if you're a Wintel person: (must read b4 u leap)Switching to the Mac: The Missing Manual, Tiger Edition by David Pogue (Editor), Adam Goldstein"
3,This Model Has No Modem,"I feel it's fair to warn those who want to buy this thinking that the only real difference is the increase in standard memory from 256K to 512K. (Video RAM remains at 32MB.) Apple thinks everybody can afford cable and DSL, so they have chosen to make modems optional. Not a huge problem if you buy from Apple's website; just check the option to install a modem for $30. But buying stock equipment from a site such as Amazon.com, you might get an unpleasant surprise when you go to plug in your phone jack. I personally don't feel it's worth $40 or more per month to invest in cable for that serious omission. Keep this in mind before you buy."
1,Dead on Arrival,Our Mac Mini arrived and looked like it had been opened and resealed.It has a dead video card and is now in for 5 days of tech service at our local Apple service provider.Very disappointing to buy a computer and not be able to start it up and use it on arrival.
2,Already a newer version,I just got the mac mini 2 months ago and already a better version is available. Can I exchange this for the new mac mini that just came out and is 4 times faster?!?!?
4,"Good box, great price","I am pleased with what came in! I am NOT a fan of MAC, but I have enough business interest to make the investment in the Apple platform worthwhile. The system arrived and is working just fine.The only draw back was the system had a lot of dust inside and a smell like stale cigarettes. It took me all of about 10 minutes to unhitch the cover and blast it out with compressed air. I also gave the cover a quick wash with some mild cleaner. It looks BRAND NEW now, and the smell is rapidly dissipating.Good value; worth it."
2,"flash is not supported, so you can't really browse with it","I am a fan of both Mac and PC, and own both. However, the PowerPC was killed when Adobe stopped making flash for it. It is still usable for design or web development, but a PC could do these tasks for far less cash. Add Linux on that PC, and it is as secure and more customizable as well. So unless I want it just because of the small footprint, it is pretty worthless."
4,A Fun Look at Hollywood's Halcyon Days,"Famed Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper up close is the gist of this fascinating book. Author Michi Sohma recovered letters written home to his mother and others in Japan in the 1950's to create a sketch book of memories which both tittilate and sadden the reader. The reader will experience much humor and surprise if, like me - he/she walks in the shoes of a young exchange student who is forced by custom and tradition to carry on bravely and shed insecurities which would almost thwart one in that situation to throw in the towel. Yet, a towel wrapped Saumrai fashion when the author pitch hits for the gardener in the garden of Hedda Hopper's fashionable Beverly Hills digs imbues Michi with the strength to carry on in the face of much adversity to surmount this chapter in his life to earn degrees from USC and become an executive in a multinational corporation."
1,MAD,this was broken faulty amplifier that got sent to me.Im extremly unsatisfied.Now i think i have to send it off to be repaired wich will cost me another 20 dollors just to get a working item i purchased brand new
5,Best Fischer movie!,"This has to be the best documentary on fischer. Enjoyed the movie on its highs and lows. If you're a Fischer or a chess fan, this is a must have!"
4,glimpse into man,"This documentary could have been easily twice as long and been just as utterly fascinating. There probably isn't going to be a director's cut or a 2nd edition but if there were... Ought to win an Oscar, hands down (and wasn't even nominated; what a snub, along with Harry Potter, Michelle Williams, etc., etc...)! Forget Hollywood and the media celebrities and their money; Bobby's going down in history!! A worthy subject and a worthy project. A real genius sorely missed, not just among chess players but, as Ljubojevic said, Bobby united and centralized a fragmented and marginalized world, only to suffer a same fate. God bless him."
2,Worked for a while..,"bought one of these a couple of months ago, It does clearly state that it is dvd+r only.. no problem there, and changing it from ntsc to pal.. only 1 click in the setup menu, and I did burn about 20 good disks with it before the problems started. It will not accept any input video from any source anymore. It has quite a few input methods.. S-video, composite, rca, and coaxial... as well as a set of front inputs. For a while it would take anything i could throw at it, now, there is no picture from anything except watching a disk on it. Coby customer support was easy to reach, and nice enough, but acted like they had never had any problems with it,and even after escalating the call to one of the 3 ""super-tech's"" the most I could get was to reset the machine. Not very helpful.Skip this one!!!!"
1,Disappointed,This machine was great while it worked. Great price. Decent playback quality. Loved the support of the various DVD formats.But.....The machine died 2 weeks after the warranty ran out...
1,Save Your Money: Don't Buy,"I have been disappointed with this product & Coby's customer service from the start. After recording, if I press either DISC OPER or EDIT on the remote control, the screen goes black and the unit will not respond to any input from the remote or the front panel; the only way to regain control of the unit is to cycle power. Coby's customer support has been disappointing, too. For warranty work, they require $6 S/H in the form of a money order, not a personal check. It offends me that I'm inconvenienced by having to send this defective unit back and, far from being sorry that I've been inconvenienced, they are concerned only that I might cheat them out of $6."
1,A Horror BUT!,"After using only 4 or 5 times, all of a sudden it started flashing HELLO,HELLO,HELLO,HELLO.Wouldn't let the disk out. Tried unplugging and re-plugging to no avail. No lights lit up-no power.I called customer Service and was very pleased to be told that I could bring it into the Maspeth facility and get a replacement.If this is true, I will find out next Tues. after the Memorial Day week-end, then I will be very happy since this unit is already past it's 90 day warranty. Happily, I live in the NYC vicinity or I don't think that I would risk sending a $31 money order plus shipping charges for a repair. Apparently they don't make DVD Recorders anymore since there are none on their website.Will send a follow-up review when and if I get my replacement.FOLLOW-UP!! THE COMPANY WAS WONDERFUL! GAVE ME A NEW DVD-R, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. I HAD NO RECEIPT AND IT WAS WAY PAST IT'S WARRANTY PERIOD. FIVE STARS TO COBY!!"
3,It's okay,"I choose this rate because is what a think about this product - The music of Simone normaly ""it's okay"""
4,Fun Sitcom,"Jeff Fx is an engaging funny man who assumes nothing and delivers a a great product.The sitcom needs our support the ""reality show"" dodo is so PHONY it nausiates the audience.It assumes that you the viewer is an idiot because you watch their CONTRIVED CRAP.The wife in the show is a future star actress."
5,Great show and all who hate it are @#$%&!,"Every great show on DVD gets a bad review from some one: Cheers, Cosby Show, etc. But everyone loves those shows and are pointless to talk smack about. The Jeff Foxworthy Show is a riot, it is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen. It even introduced Haley Joel Osment(The Sixth Sense, Secondhand Lions). Jeff Foxworthy is the most under rated entertainer in the history of history. Hollywood has a formula and that formula is an average American family living anywhere besides the south. But what Hollywood is too stupid to realize is HALF OF AMERICA LIVES IN THE SOUTH! How about a new formula Hollywood! So check this one out it is a real treat that got cancelled early because of Hollywood! So chant with me ""Hollywood is a big fat ******* pig with ******* no *****!Love,The Jones!"
4,Great Value,"Never seeing this show before, I bought the DVD purely on the low price. I amalso a fan of some of Jeff Foxworthy's other work. I was supprised that this is a quality show, each episode got better and better, well up untill wayne (Jay Mohr) comes into the show (episode 13). I agree with others, that this is when the show loses focus, and gets a little crazy, a real change to the earlier episodes. Still very watchable show.Reading other reviews, I cant wait to see the second season.Well worth the budget price, would have given it 5 stars if they never introduced that Wayne character."
3,Give it two and a half star...,"Jeff is very funny and is carrying the whole show. The characters Walt and Russ were funny and added a little bit spice to it. I don't understand why they let those guys go, because the show got bad (and my rating dropped then big time) when they replaced them with the sister and the brother. Especially the brother is not funny but annoying and the sister is quite boring. Wrong decission for the fans and the show. From then on thumbs down ... sorry"
1,Zero stars should be an option,"One of the worst chapters in television's history. Why, oh WHY does Columbia Tristar think it's worth RELIVING?!?!Meanwhile, the entire MTM library rots in a dark cave somewhere.Makes no sense!"
5,Red,Funny show. Does have a lot of redneck jokes I've heard before but that's cause I enjoy Jeff Foxworthy. Good wholesome family show. Not many of those anymore.
3,An O.K,"I'm not a fan of poetry at all and this book isn't any diffrent. Alltho I enjoyed reading it this wasn't my favorite. To new readers that like poems this book you might enjoy to read as your 1st, and otherwise as your 8th or 9th, and as a 1st read Cathrine or Cleopatra. This diary is a story about a 14 yr. old princess that is engaged to a noble that she loves untill her brother, the king choses another prince for her to marry. It is a book anyone who likes poetry and romance can enjoy. I hope this review is helpful, Thank You Kindly"
4,"A non-taxing, good, warm fuzzy read.","The fascinating concept of brainships is wedded with recognition of society'sresponsibility to maximize the potential of it's members. Nancia's growth from naivenewness to flexible adulthood is accompanied by normal emotional trauma. Selfawareness, recognition of self worth and valuation of others are wrapped in anentertaining reading experience. Cynical recognition of who you know rather thanwhat you know doesn't detract from the message or the idealistic theme that goodworks and good will can triumph."
5,The Quilts of Gee's Bend,"This is really a great historical dvd. It is filled with much inspiration of how quilts from a time were so important and still play a important roll in our homes today. Anyone who ever had a grandmother or, a favorite family member to share the art of how to make a quilt, or to receive one will have a great appreciation for this dvd.Rickey Anderson"
5,Charlie's Camera,"A great book about never ending love. It shows how different generations view the world, life, and love. Pick this book up today!"
2,Pretentious,"I tried to read this but found it very boring and arch-literary. The writer should go out there and get a real job, mingle with the real people, and see what life is all about. Like the author's last name, I can't ""hack it""!"
5,A Beautiful Book,"I savored every word of Joyce Hackett's extraordinary book. I loved it for its wonderful use of the language and for the almost mythic content of the story it presents. Hackett has got inside the mind of a musician, and inside the mind of the guilt-ridden child of a concentration camp survivor. A vein of ironic humor runs through the story of the unexpected circumstances that bring about her heroine's eventual personal and musical liberation. Not an ounce of sentimentality. A wonderful piece of writing. Vigorously recommended."
5,Seduction Come Back,"These ladies were HOT! I had the honor of spend the day with them in DC at their primere at a downtown club. April Harris and I were friends,and Michelle & Idalis were so sweet.Idalis- is in the movie ""Woman Thou Art Loosed"".April- well I saw her in downtown DC a long while ago but, she didn't see me in a cab.(LOL) I hope she is doing well...I miss singing with her.(Howard U/Stratus recording days.)Michelle- as said Miss.DJ is doing her thang. I miss chattin' with her too.Real talented ladies with beautiful spirits!"
3,Freestyle Review,"The music was enjoyable, filled with powerful beats and nice melodies, however the lyrics were questionable at times, especially Track # 9."
3,Early 90's Pop Hits,"How could these girls drop off the face of the earth? The album is no longer made. They had 4 songs that were in the top 40 on the album, they were regulars on the Club MTV Dance show when it first started. One of the girls became a VJ for MTV. (Idalis) Two to make it right, Heartbeat (the extended mix with rap), Could this be love, and Breakdown all made the charts. This is a good album if you like the 90's Dance R&B like Bell Biv Devoe, C&C Music Factory, Gerardo, EnVogue, etc... Must Have..."
5,Awesome thriller with a real message!,"This movie just sucks you right in so that when you think you know what to expect next, it grabs you in a different way. Great movie, similar to Hitchcock thrillers with its darkness."
3,Software for Alignment,"The labels found inside works fine, however the application that comes with it is in a mess. Download this software called Acoustica CD Label maker. It will give you an almost perfect alignment after printing. You can get perfect alignment by adjusting it using the software."
5,Love Them!,Love the Memorex labels. I use the free program to print and it works great and for less than half the cost of Avery labels. These are all I have bought for years.
5,Disc labels are great!,These are very easy to use when you install the proper program to design your disc. They go on the cd easily. What I did was take the blank cd spool and line it up that way to make sure it goes on perfect. Will buy again
1,I do not endorse this product,"Their packaging is terrible. They say 'download the software' and once you BUY the product and try to download it, you realize it's only for Windows. Huh. I'm MacIntosh. So, it's no good. Why don't they just include a general template (say, Word document) as a backup? Now, I've ripped open the product and I can't get my money back and I can't use it.Oh, and then I saw in TEENY TINY print that these can't be used for DVDs. Why don't they say that in HUGE letters on the front? I don't have time to read all that fine print on the back of the box.Really, they should update their packaging. I'm so disappointed and now I have 300 labels I can't use."
1,Texts and pictures on the labels SMEAR ! ! !,"I just bought these matte labels. When I printed a photo, I noticed that photos come out at the ultra lowest quality, and the worst part is that everything printed on these labels SMUDGE when fingers are lightly run over the labels.Has anyone experienced this? Please share your story."
1,"Staisfactory Labels, Buggy Software","The labels are fine and dandy, but the software that comes with them is horrid. Not only did the calibration page not print, but there is no way to pre-size an image to a desired resolution (so I can enhance the enlarged image). Also, what did print ended up looking grainy. In the end, I had to appropriately resize and print my own images, adding white borders to the left and top edges to get it to center on the label."
2,Make sure you are not buying these for DVDs,I bought these to make labels for my DVDs as when I received them there is a warning on the back that if you use them on DVDs they may make the DVD unreadable. These are only to be used on CDs. Memorex makes specific labels that are plasic for DVDs and do not warp when exposed to the heat of a DVD player. 2 stars because the packaging is misleading.
2,Memorex CD Labels Refills,The software with this package stinks. I cannot manage to get labels that are centered even with fine tuning the settings. It is very frustrating!!
5,Works as expected,"There isn't much to say about the labels, other than they work. I didn't have any problems printing on them or peeling them."
2,Mis-leading description,"Package contents indicates package as containing both lables and software. When actually, what is in the box are labels and no software."
3,Labeling your DVDs,Not perfect but good enough until something better comes along. Paper is good. It holds the ink well and I finally figured out how to get it to work with my Discus software.
1,Disappointment,I attempted to download the required program to use the labels with my MacBook but could not access the program. I then emailed Memorex to find out if it was Mac compatible but got no response. It probably doesn't make sense to return them to Amazon due to the postage cost.
3,Good Labels,"These are great labels. The white label makes for a clean crisp look when printed. My only problem is that the label doesn't always stay put. I used these labels on my final project for my graduate degree. I didn't know that my professor's computer had a CD drive that the cd just slides into rather than a drawer coming out. Unfortunately the label came off the cd when he ejected it from his computer. I felt bad that I had caused him the extra work of having to take things apart and clean out his cd drive. Now, I just write what I want on the front of my cd. If I burn a CD/DVD for someone else, I put the label if they want it, but suggest that they only use the CD or DVD in a drive with a drawer that comes out."
2,NEW SOFTWARE TERRIBLE! WHY?,"In about 2000, I made a series of beautiful CD labels using the Memorex CD Label program--Then, when my computer imploded, lost that program and had no way to even open the labels until I bought the current software.AND IT IS TERRIBLE-- Where previously the software was use-friendly, quick and allowed a lot of artistry, now it is a slow, primitive version of its former self.I just wonder--Why would Memorex shoot their own software in the foot like this? Are they just planning to phase it out entirely, but making it too difficult and time-consuming to even use?"
5,"Great service, great item",I ordered Memorex CD label Refills the 120 pack and couldn't find a betterbargain anywhere. Service was wonderful.
5,Staying power,I have used this product for several years and prefer them over any other matte finished brand of cd label I have used. The print quality is good when used with either an injet or laser printer.
3,Normandie & murder,"This murder mystery takes place aboard the classic ocean liner Normandie. The plot was a bit too simple for my liking and the author made several mistakes. One of the biggest was that he mentions the superliner Queen Elizabeth to be in service in 1938 when in fact she was launched two years later! Anyway, a pleasant read, but no great classic."
5,Best book I've read on understanding how a child develops,"As a Nurse-midwife and then as a mother, I was fascinated with watching the unfoldment of how a child comes into being. How do their senses develop? What is the process of how they learn to reach and turn and crawl and eventually walk? I learned so much from this book that helped me tremendously with my son that I am now buying it for my sister!"
3,Can't understand what all the hoopla's about,"I read this book after reading all the prior reviews. For the most part, I thought that the concepts promoted in the book were well-founded but not terribly enlightening. Most of the tenets propounded were fairly available through use of a parent's common sense. It was encouraging, however, to see that an ""expert"" agrees with my common sense. It also was helpful to have it re-emphasized that the period from 8 to 24 months is extremely important in terms of the child's lifelong personality."
3,Self Help/Parenting with a Buddhist flavour,"This is not a bad book but it is fairly simplistic. It is a good book for mothers (Buddhist or not) of young children who won't mind the populist feel of the book. It is not an especially deep work though, so if you like your Buddhist books to be fairly weighty and insightful this is going to disappoint. If, on the other hand, you don't mind a book that reads like a series of really long magazine articles then you will probably like it."
5,Buddhism for Mothers: A Calm Approach to Caring for Yourself and Your Children,A great perspective on how to take care of yourself as you enter motherhood!
1,Publishing/printing error,"This might have been a very worthwhile book but I won't know since the copy I received from Amazon is missing the last several chapters. Unfortunately, as the parent of a small child it wasn't until well after the deadline for returning the book that I noticed the problem (having little time to read these days)."
5,A lifeline,"When I was suffering from postpartum depression, and my mind was filled with crazy thoughts of guilt, worry, and hopelessness, this was a real life saver. This book helped me see everything from a completely different (and more healthy) perspective. I would recommend this book to every new mom, no matter what faith she is.I'm so glad I read this book when my son was only a few months old, I'm sure I'll be able to deal with him in a more calm and patient way for the rest of his life.My favorite lesson from this book: treat every person and every situation with gentleness, patience, and persistence. But remember, treat YOURSELF with gentleness and patience too. Being a new mom is hard enough without beating ourselves up about it."
3,Hot and not.,Several of the numbers in this album are HOT but not enough of them to make it worth buying the album when I can get the best of them in other albums.
1,Boring and emotionless mainstream soul,"Simply Red are a lightweight soul group manufacturered for the masses. Spare yourself and buy real soul such as James Brown. I had to endure this garbage for THREE months every day, all day, where I worked. This album is up there with Wigfield's Saturday Night as my most irritating music of all time."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this Bible as a gift for my parents. THe cover seemed elegant in the photo, and the price was quite good for a paperback edition.I was absolutely disappointed when I got it: the cover is brown, not black, losing much of the effect and giving it the aspect of a cheap book.I found it difficult to read through: the fonts are really small, there is no separation between books (in the same page 37, for example, a little underlined text indicates where the second book of Moses starts), and, worse, there are no headers indicating which book you are looking at: in a certain page you will se ""''''' 15"" (Chapter 15) without knowing to which book it belongs. To know it, you must go back to the index.A couple of maps at the end cannot make up for the lacking. If you are looking for a reprint of and old text, this book may be for you.If you want a gift Bible, or a Bible to read on a daily basis, this is definitely not the one."
3,LPN student,I am an LPN student. I did buy this but havent used it not once. I went to the Dollar store and bought a big yearly planner for $1 and that has become my Bible. I wright everything in it for oth myself and my children. I would save the money and go to the Dollar store.
5,Hunter Humidifiers,"I just read the above reviews. Ouch! Maybe I got lucky, I have had 2 running constantly in the winter (Wisconsin) for 2 years now, and no problems. I bought the first one at Sam's club, and the 2nd from Ebay.I do like the fact that you don't need to buy any additional filters, they are relatively quiet, and they do humidify the air. Just clean it out at the end of the season, and you'll be ok.My daughter and son-in-law just had a baby, so I was looking for one for the new family when I came across these reviews. I am surprised at the negatives, but that won't deter me from getting another one."
3,Hunter Humidifier,"Having read the reviews I am not sure I would buy this unit online. But I did by mine online from Costco. I use mine 24/7 and regarding cleaning I have had not problem. I also get the amount of water in the air I ask for. I have had this unit going 7months with no problems. The amount of noise for the high is fine. I have soft water but I still use the water cleaner solution that you can buy for humidifiers.My CON: is that you cannot clean the electrical part where the fan brings up the water or anywhere around the motor. I actually have not been able to find a way at all to clean the motor section of the unit. I am also finding that even though I have been rinsing off the water pad it is crumbling away on me. And because you don't need to replace it, I can't replace it. My maching is still working but the pad is begining to smell old and musty and would love to buy another, but am a tad gunshy at this moment."
2,Model 33288 - The good - The bad,"The unit does a very good job humidifying the air. It's economical because of the permanent filter. However, as with the last two I owned, several years ago, the motor will not turn after several months of storage. I used this, and the privious units, continuously for 3>4 months. It's got to be mineral build up in the pump (and probably on the drive shaft), which is attached to the motor armature. It would be very difficult to disassemble the pump with damaging the clips which hold it together. And then, how would one clean the shaft and shaft housing.I like the humidifier. It really works well, when it is working. I live in Ohio and have a filtration system on my home's water system, and my water really isn't that hard. I don't like the idea that you can't service the pump or get to the pump shaft to clean any hardened mineral deposits. Until this is problem resolved, I would not recommend anyone purchasing any of the Hunter humidifiers, with this design."
1,This last only an Year,"I thought Hunter makes good products. This unit doesn't work more than one year, I have bought 2 of these last year both of them stop working as of last week. For the 1st one the motor went bad, for the second one the fan went off."
1,Loud Fan,I'm returning this ASAP. I tried using it in my bedroom and couldn't stand the noise. There's only two settings for the fan. High or Low. Even low was too loud for me. The sound is equivalent to a vortex fan unit. I was thinking if Hunter made ceiling fans then this unit would be quiet. But I was wrong.
4,Awesome worshipper!,Maurette is rightly called the Princess of Praise. All throughout the CD she was inspiring and uplifting. There were only 1 or 2 songs that didn't stand out to me but it's a great buy overall.
4,THE DREAM,"I LOVE THIS CD - IT REALLY EASY LISTENING, VERY ANOINTED AND VERY ENCOURAGING....I LOVE MY HEART HAS BEEN RESTORED TRACK # 6 AND SOVEREIGN GOD TRACK # 8..... VERY POWERFUL AND UPLIFTING WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL THOSE THAT LOVE TO PRAISE THE LORD"
2,A begining,some of the music is very good but alot of this CD wasn't what i expect and maybe other might say different but this is what i fill from it.
5,One of the best biographies of Nietzsche I've read.,"This biography is the most accurate and indeed, critical. It dealves into the life and thought of one of the greatest thinkers in Western Europe. Anyone who wishes to have a good introduction into Friedrich Nietzsche should read this book...by all means, read it!!"
5,It shipped on time,"Its a bummer that NASA shut down. My wife was really bummed out, so I got her some memorabilia. The cupped arrived with no chips."
5,"Excellent quality, cool to have!","Everything looks like in the image, good quality, i drink coffee in it every single day:)"
5,Donna Karan Cashmere Mist,"I've loved this light & feminine scent for years, & have worn it since it 1st came out. Product was reasonably priced & arrived quickly, & in great condition. If you're looking for a new scent to try for summer, try this one. It's light & airy, but stays on without re-applying for hours!"
2,Disappointed,"Service was excellent, I received my purchase in record time......But once I began using the product I realized that it had very little fragrance. I have been wearing Cashmire Mist for many years so I am aware of how it smells on me. I believe the product was either old or diluted in some way."
1,Not Cashmere,I am certain that this was not the same Cashmere that you would find in a department store. Mine looked like the product but the scent was very diluted. I have since visited department stores and sampled the real thing which I am sure is not what I received. I don't recommend this item.
3,Donna Karan Cashmere Mist Review,Tried it from magazine sample...loved it. I recently bought it and a little bit goes a long way. One squirt is almost too much.
1,TERRIBLE KNOCK OFF,I have worn Cashmere Mist for at least 10 years and my husband bought this for me for Christmas from this site .. there should have been a red flag with the price difference. The difference is this is not the real thing...it smells awful. Don't waste your money when you see there is a large discrepency in price between the same product. Don't know if there is a way to get $$ back but going to try .. Amazon should really pay better attention to the products they are selling.
2,Doesn't smell anything like the original Cashmere Mist,"I have used Cashmere Mist by Donna Karan for a while now. However, this was my first time purchasing online because of the awesome price. Since, I have never ordered perfumes before I totally missed that the item is non-returnable. Now, I am stuck with it and don't like it! :("
1,Is this a knock off product?,I am very unhappy with this purchase and wish I had saved original packaging. I may still return it. It took me a few months to really pay attention... this is not the real fragrance--lots of alcohol smell in it.I'll never buy a fragrance on line again.
1,Not worth the money,"I have bought other brands of Eau De Toilette and been very satisfied, Cashmere Mist failed miserably. I can put it on my pulse points and it is barely detectable and only if you have your nose right over the application sight. I will never buy this again and recommend you save your money."
2,does not last very long,While it does not have a horrible scent; it does not have any staying power either. The scent does not last very long on me and I was disappointed by this. Lesson learned that paying the extra expense is definitely worth it.
2,not what expected,Love the smell but i don't think it is lasting!!! Not what I expected at all! Will not buy again.Wish I could return it.
2,now I know better,"should have read the other reviews. This smells great but being a toilette instead of a parfum, the smell dissipates too quickly for what I paid."
5,VERY LIGHT AND NICE,I've been purchasing this product now for the past two years. The fragrance is very nice and light; and the smell last all day long. My wife loves this product and has nothing but good things to say about it.
1,fragrance does not last,The fragrance received is not what I have experienced before with Cashmere Mist. There is no lasting fragrance at all. Could this bottle be an inferior knock off? Will not buy from this site again.
5,great gift for wife,My wife couldn't believe that I remembered her saying that she liked this scent from a magazine. When she received the gift for Christmas she couldn't have been happier. The overall scent is pleasant and refined to the nose. Great smell on a woman.
4,Cashmere Mist by Donna Karan,"I absolutely love this scent. I feel all cozy and comfy as if wrapped in a cashmere blanket. It's a very soft, gentle scent."
2,Book on time,Book was torn and ripped..(due to delivery) But overall book was in great condition. Thank you
5,Superb for new parents,"This book guides new parents though all the stages and aspects of a child's development, plus gives great ideas of how to help the child through each stage. From games to play to helpful toys. It is a great guide"
5,Awesome,These guys are even GREAT live! I love every song... Drea is one kick ass chick. I would Highly recommend this to anyone. I am so glad I got this cd and play it often on the radio. Keep Kickin ass you guys!!! YOU'RE GOING TO THE TOP!!!
3,More Humanist Idolatry,"I've always thought of Timothy Leary and his associates as being drug-addled Ozzie Ozbournes, much like the character ""Jim"" on the old tv series ""Taxi,"" but Leary's introduction was too well written, expressing complex ideas very well in prose that's accessible to anybody, even to dummies like me.Unfortunately, the author appears to be celebrating rebellious human nature. He elevates ""creative"" change for the sake of change to a virtue, and makes humanism his god. This is idolatry. As a Christian, I can't condone this. He's making a serious mistake, damaging himself spiritually, and advocating that others do the same.I'll give him high marks for his clear and entertaining writing style and for the wide scope of his historical reading and interest, but I can't support what he presents to the reader; I can't support idolatry."
3,I liked one track,This was a hard search for me and I am happy that I was able to find at a good price.
4,More than just another cajun party CD,"Sure there's the accordion runs, the hard rocking rhythm section, the plaintive vocals, but Richard gives the listener more than traditional Cajun party music. Listen to him describe the loss of language and culture on ""No French, No More,"" or the tragedy of Henry Hebert (en francais) and you know there is more going on with Richard than zydeco. That's not to say that Richard can't light a fire when he feels like it, ""Who Stole My Monkey,"" ""My Nannette,"" and ""Too Many Women"" all get the party going. But you'll remember the thoughtful pieces for a long time after the party songs fade away."
4,Drexciya - Harnessed The Storm,"Drexciya returns with another album of underwater Detroit electro, Harnessed the Storm. As always, the production values are outstanding -- the synths are well-modulated, the percussion exact. Here, as on other albums, they seem to favor a staticky, bubbly hi-hat, which only adds to the whole underwater feel. ""Digital Tsunami"" has the force of a storm, while ""Dr. Blowfins' Black Storm Stabilizing Sphere"" sounds exactly like the name describes. ""Lake Haze"" goes for a more straightforward electro feel (one of the few tracks that could make its way onto the dancefloor), but atmosphere -- or should I say liquisphere? -- is the order of the day. Dive on in. The water's fine."
4,Wow. Orbital 2 meets Last Train to Lhasa,"This is really one of the best trance/progressive ALBUMS (as opposed to a mix CD) to have come out in about the last 5 years. The sound is pure Platipus, similar to Art of trance, with that touch of spiritual/I Ching/Raga thing...I love it. My friends love it. This is absolutely worth the money. Well produced and lively, introspective and even dancable.Ambient moments, real IDM."
5,The Greatest Record Ever,"OK, maybe not the greatest record ever, but pretty close. Politics, sex, drugs, commerce, literary allusions, rock music illusions, and Elvis all wrapped up in one big post-punk package. Multiple writers, multiple singers, multiple perspectives maintain the creative tension and keep it from getting all bogged down. Sally Timms' difficult personality, beautiful voice, and probably Jon Langford's best guitar playing on record. Life embossed on a small laminated disk of metal. Get it."
4,great rock and roll full of spunk.,"three fine lead vocalists grace this overlooked album from 1989. jon langford's voice is loose and cocky and full of attitude with a joe strummer-ish swagger. sally timm's vocals are strong and precise and sound full of confidence. tom greenhalgh's singing articulates a superb sense of english-pop phrasing. throughout this recording the guitars dominate the music, dense and powerful, churning out layer upon layer of catchy hooks. ""empire of the senseless,"" is the classic track here, but there are plenty of great moments, including the superb strangeness of ""cocaine lil,"" the clash-like rocker, ""amnesia,"" the powerful anthem ""heaven and back,"" and ""echo,"" with its big drum beat and wall of guitar sound. this cd needs a bigger audience. go ahead and become a part of it."
1,"NOTHING SPECIAL AT ALL ,POOR DEMOS+LIVE SONGS","This is ones of those CD's I wanted to like but never could make myself no matter how many times I tried. Its does however have George Fischer that is of course now with Cannibal Corpse,not even with him on the vocals can he save this CD. Its very repetitous and sounds a little like malevolent creation. This is death metal at its worst,with hardly any cool riffs and overall nothing that makes it stand out from the pack. I WOULD RECOMMEND (IMMOLATION,DECAPITATED,ARCH ENEMY)FOR TRUELY GREAT DEATH METAL!"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Much like the Greatest Batman Stories Ever Told, the Greatest Joker Stories ever told look at the Joker through the ages, as they did for his nemesis.So here you have collected stories over several decades, which range from quite goofy to downright diabolical. Batman will of course appear frequently."
5,Like the Joker = This is MUST then!,"I've always been a fan of the Joker ever since Jack Nicolson's portrayal as the character and what I had seen in the animated series. After reading this collection, I fell in love with this CRAZY CLOWN even more. Also if you are just a fan of Batman the older comics that appear in the this comic collection are great! I loved every minute of it from the artwork to the storylines!"
1,"Oh my, how awful","This is the worst tasting ""candy"" I have ever tried. I had to spit it out. If you took a candle, dripped some melted wax into a disc, then put it into your mouth, THAT would taste better. And they were irregular bark shaped pieces, what happened? I thought they were supposed to be flamingo shaped. The chocolate had also ""bloomed"", meaning the surface was white. I don't know if they were too old or inferior, perhaps both. Edit: This is terrible, I wasted $12. I didn't know amazon doesnt allow returns of food. Just great."
1,Disappointed,"Like Mel Carter, too much talking. I would prefer to have a recording which is only singing. Interaction with the audience is boring."
2,DIAPERS,VERY THIN MATERIALi THOUGH THIS WAS COMPARABLE TO LUVSVERY POOR QUALITYLAST TIME TO PURCHASE NOT PLEASED AT ALL
4,"Insane Amp, but not 4000 watts","Ok first off, this amp is impressive but not 4000 watts more like eh pushing 2000 at 2 ohm, ive got it hooked up to 2 rockford p2s and it sets off car alarms, its cheap and good,i only have 2 problems, firstITS FREAKING HUGE, i almost couldnt put it anywere in my car, i mean 21 inchs thats almost 2 feet, but hell it looks freaking sexxysecond, it cuts off sometimes if u crank the bass knob to fast, *turn it up to fast*But it has no problems what so ever with keeping cool, thats my favorite part about it,im going to buy 2 more of these for my car for the 4 15s i have being ordered now, honestly i cant wait, there perfect for what im useing,Well good luck, if you buy this i cant gaurnetee ull have hearing problems but it will be loud, and anyoying to your nieghboors lolGood luckid buy again and will"
4,Powerful,"This amp is very much worth every dollar. I have had people make faces at the name, but when they here the power it puts out, you can see the change in their facial expressions. It is not the power it says it is, but you will still not be lacking of power when you push your system."
5,Very Good for the Price,This is a great amp for the price. of course you wont get all 4000 watts like it claims but i can sure youll be suprise when you listen to it. i think lanzar is a great brand if you know how to take care of your stuff? it also all depends on how you set it up...if your thinking of buying do it youll be suprised.
5,These slippers are beautiful!,"I saw a picture of these slippers in a magazine (Woman's Day, I believe). The slippers were a prize for some sort of contest the magazine featured. I called my daughter in Chicago and asked if she could look for the slippers on line so I could buy them -- I didn't feel lucky enough to just try to win them. But I was very lucky when my daughter found them at Amazon.com. I received the slippers quickly and they are more beautiful in person than the picture in the magazine -- and, more importantly, comfy too!"
1,"SADDEST, SORRIEST SLIPPERS SOLD","I've worn Deer Foam slippers for a number of years and have always appreciated their comfort and reasonable price. No more! These are the saddest, sorriest excuse for slippers I can imagine.First, the size is off - I don't know whether they were wrongly sized but a size 8 is no longer an 8. They're not soft and accommodating but hard and unyielding. And lastly the beaded trim leaves a trail on the carpet wherever you go.My advice is to slip right on by these and buy another style."
2,Dearfoam Shantung Slippers,"They are lovely slippers, but not comfortable at all. Generally Dearfoam are very comfy. These are a harder, sturdier slipper but not as soft as the original Dearfoams. They are well-made however."
5,Premium Hiatt in His Prime,"John Hiatt is AWESOME baby! And this album is one of those albums that continues to grow on you every time you listen. Its why I never grow tired of listening to it. It is so diverse and has so many musical elements in it. It's nearly impossible to put in words the bare essence of this eclectic performer and how his raw and broad talent is captured... Probably, one of the most overlooked albums ever made period! Buy this damn album NOW!!!"
2,I would recommend the A&E or Lifetime videos instead,"I was very disappointed with this video. First, it seemed very short. Second, there is no footage on this video that is not available on the A&E; and Lifetime documentaries about Evita, and those are far superior videos as they include interviews with people who knew Evita and worked with her. There are no interviews with anyone who knew Evita on this video. The only interview is with Madonna - and it is a very short interview and was not done specifically for this video, rather is it stock footage that has been made available to all EVITA promotional events.I was very disappointed with this video. And, as I recall, this video is recorded in the worst possible mode - EP/SLP. Which means the quality is very very poor."
5,A charming collection. . .,"of hymns and voluntaries for the beginning church musician. They are all arrainged at the intermediate level, but are not so simple as to bore a more accomplished player. Although pianistic, the arrangements would also work on a pedal-less organ, and the one improvement I might ask for would be suggested registrations for organ."
5,soulful urban country blues -,"I had this CD on the juke box at the bar i work at a few years ago and have just recently started to listen to it again. Wonderful lyrics with urban themes. Yes, there is a 500 club. Its at 17th and Gurerro in san francisco. Near the bar where I work. I wish the artist had some thing more current. I would love to hear more of his music. Dont let the release date fool you this music is timeless."
4,"SUBJECTIVE VIEWS, INTERESTING CHOICES, GOOD SUGGESTIONS","A diver for just two years, I have already used this Unofficial Guide on at least three occasions. Yes, the choices presented are highly subjective (as most diving guides tend to be), but there are a wide range of locales and choices to get one started. I have begun all of my diving vacations by referring first to this guide...then researching more thoroughly on the internet. Usually, I end up using one of the dive operators and diving resorts which the book has suggested and finish the process by making reservations via the internet or by phone. If you enjoy reading more comprehensively about diving before making your decision, look elsewhere...if you are like me and prefer to glance at something more condensed or capsulized, check out ""World's Best Diving Vacations."""
3,Somewhat misleading,"I bought this under the impression that it would be a choir singing the carols, but actually there are two soloists performing all the carols in this collection (a female singer does the last two and a male singer does the rest). While the performances are certainly adequate, it is hardly a choir. The music is good and the singing acceptable, but it is nothing to scream about."
3,Design wears off quickly!,"I too like these cups with the exception that the design scratches off. This started happening immediately when my daughter started using them. After about 6 months, most of the design was gone leaving just enough to make the cups look extremely worn and old. I didn't want to buy new sippy cups because they don't leak and are otherwise great cups. I eventually ended up gently rubbing a green pot scrubbing pad over them to get the remaining paint off of them. Sadly, my daughter just has plain pink and purple cups with no princesses now!"
1,Item received not as pictured,We received our order today and the cups were not the cups in the picture. These looked like completely different cups from the picture and we were disappointed to not open our order to find the cups our daughter loves.
4,Works great!,"These cups work great and my daughter likes them. I hate cleaning the extra valve, but it does its job and keeps the cup from leaking."
3,I love these cups but.......,I love the playtex sippy cups but there is something wrong with the plastic and paint on these cups for some reason the paint chips off really easy so it is cute for a while but ugly when it starts to chip my son only had his Buzz light year ones for about 4-6 months and I have to get rid of them they look ugly now you can't even tell who was on them.
5,"Challenging, But enjoyable to work with.","I'm a Scroll saw user for the last 4 years,I really love projects that are challenging and yet will fit with my experience. The projects in the Making your own Baskets are very good for the beginner through the expert.Read the directions and really under stand them and you will not have a problem. With anything its patience and that sense of feeling from the heart that really helps. I have finished several of the baskets listed and I'm looking forward to doing one(at least)of every one listed in the issue. I Would recommend this to any of my wood worker friends."
5,A powerful video on mental illness,I purchased this DVD to do research for a graduate class presentation. The video is powerful.
4,Gory but entertaining,This book is very well written and I really enjoyed some of the stories. I found some of them a bit too gory for my taste. But the Bloody Chamber is great and The courtship of Mr. Lyon is beautiful.
1,waste of time,"This is bad writing at its worst because it is apparent that it could have maybe been good.The imagery is dull, cliché, and facile. The stories are predictable and, worst of all, uninteresting. Everything is over-stylized, obvious, and with very little sense of anything novel or surprising. In reality, they are unintelligent and prepubescent. In general, a waste of time."
5,totally stimulating and fasinating,"This is a must for the readers who are wanting to be intriged by the transformation of childhood fairytales converted to stories of sexual realisation, and how women were living in a male dominated society. Very addictive and I have greatly enjoyed reading whilst studying for my English degree!"
3,Shiny new dresses,"Carter's collection of reworked faerie and folk tales is quite amazing. She succintly carves out the heart of the story and places it in a new form. And her use of potent sensuality (like in the wonderful ""Puss in Boots"") is marvelous. I wanted to like the book more, but all the stories aren't as captivating, so. The book is remarkable for its intelligence and sparkling originality."
3,Gothic retellings,"This was a mixed bag for me. A variety of fairy tale retellings, some were great, a few left me scratching my head and wondering what the hell..., others just bored me. I would have liked to have a wider variety of tales retold as a couple of stories were different views on same tale (Red Riding Hood Beauty & the Beast are overdone IMHO) but overall, it was interesting to read these short stories. Also, Carter'svarious styles are fascinating to wade through and the language was often sumptous and very stylized to the specific interpretation. For that alone, I enjoyed it!"
5,Twisted fairy tales,"I had to read this book for one of my college courses and absolutly loved it. The way Carter twists the fairy tales and adds a sometimes morbid clencher is excellent. I loved the statments she was making in them and the way stories were told was excellent. As was the fact that women weren't made out to be weak or that their only rightful place was in the kitchen. Out of all the stories in the book I found ""The Tigers Bride"" (re-telling of Beauty and the Beast) and ""The Company of Wolves"" (re-telling of Little Red Riding Hood) to be my favorites."
4,Great Radios,"I bougth these pair of Marine Radios and the service is great, the cost was a little higth compare with other brands butIm ok the service is great"
1,Bad LCD Display,"I purchased this unit because it was a portable device I could use on the boat. I received my radio and charged it overnight. I turned it on and could not make heads or tails of what it was displaying. The LCD display had several bars out and you couldn't tell what channel you was on or some of the menu functions. Maybe they are good radios and I just received a bad one, but I returned the item and will do without for now."
2,Midland Nautico Marine Radio,The radio is difficult to operate and has a very short range. I guess it's good as a backup radio.
5,Outstanding product!,"I have tried numerous other whiteners for teeth. This one is the best I've tried. You only need a small amount and I saw immediate results. My teeth were not terribly stained, just dull from coffee. This product whitened them up beautifully! A product that does what it is supposed to do for a very reasonable price!"
5,Just like what the dentist uses and sells you.,"I whiten my teeth. I would have them done at my dentists office. Then I would purchase a refill from my dentist for future use. Well, one day I decided to check amazon for the refills and couldn't believe how inexpensive they are. Boy was my dentist ripping me off. I'm sure he buys them on amazon and then sells them to me for tripple the cost. I will never buy these refills from my dentist again. I have also noticed that the Watts refills have whitened my teeth better than the dentist brand. A little goes a long way and you don't have to re-whiten for 6+ months. Once I forgot about whitening because my teeth were so white. I couldn't remember the last time that I used the Watts product because the product does such a great job. I strongly recommend this product to everyone. Don't buy it from your dentist anymore."
3,it kind of scares me,It came as ordered and as promised but there's something about it that scares me. It made my teeth really white but since I have stopped using it they actually seem more brown than they did before which makes me think that my teeth are more porous than before. I don't plan to continue to use it.
4,works as advertised,I have done about four treatments and have not experienced the burning or discomfort as using other products in the past. I have noticed the whitening difference in about the third treatment. I'm happy with the results so far
5,worked well in one week,"I wanted whiter teeth so I bought this product and a fancy toothbrush (sonic) those two things have made a huge impact. I did have some minor sensitivity, but my dentist had told me that would happen with his stuff too. And his was $200. This was a great deal and after using it for a month, I have only used about 2/3 of the first syringe (a little goes a long way) thanks. I would buy again."
3,Not as white as I wanted,"This is the first time I have used this product. In other whitening products I have tried with less peroxide, my teeth were whiter. They gel is hard to get out and when I used the instructions to unthicken the gel with water, my teeth were spotty white after. Oh, well."
1,This product was not effective.,"I bought this item to get my teeth whiter for my sister's wedding. I already had the mouthpiece from previously whitening with gel purchased from a dentist. The first clue I received that this product was not going to work well was that I felt no tingling, pain etc. when the gel was in. I remember when I used the product from my dentist, my gums would tingle and hurt by the end, and my teeth would have sensitivity. Not that I am promoting mouth pain! But it means that there is a chemical doing its job. The level of this gel was higher than that I purchased from my dentist, and I felt nothing and had no sensitivity. I still continued to the use the product though, in hopes that maybe my teeth had just become less sensitive. But at the end of a couple months, I still had little change to the level of whitness of my teeth."
5,Impressed with the author,Thank you for a story that reaches into the imagination and draws in the reader. A story for all ages
4,Good read,"Just when I thought what could be new or interesting about this series...comes another installment. It's a good read, keeps the reader engaged. Good read."
5,this L.O.L makes me LOL;b,"Cute book, love the whole series! I love that she true her granddaughter's gift all the timeThis book kinda reminds me of my gramdma (without the murderers) maybe that's why I love it"
4,good read,I feel like I lucked out when I randomly chose to read book 1 in this series. I have read all three now. I really enjoy her main character and the humor Ms McCourtney incorporates in her mystery series. I was happy to find that she is a Christian author and reveals it in her story line.
5,On the Run,"A good fun read, especially since I am a LOL. It keeps you wondering and second guessing who did it for a long time."
4,Enjoyed the mystery and humor,Really enjoyed this whole series. Could relate to a lot of the things that happen in the book. Loved the humor. Kept me interested.
5,Review The Specs on Your Saw,"Ever though the write up on the chain appeared to be correct I did not do enough research and the cain received would not fit the chain saw I have. Before ordering I would check out several sites to make certain the chain being ordered is the correct one. I had to return this chain. It was my fault for not doing enough ""homework"".It appears to me Amazon should list more specs on each chain being sold."
4,"Helpful, but lacking","I really had higher expectations for this book, i was looking for some species and i just couldn't find them. i also have something to add- Darth Maul is a ZABRAK, NOT an irdonian. Kit Fitso is a Zabrak and Irdonian(is that how you spell it?) Cross-breed. yoda, though, is what i want to find out about. him and yaddle."
5,Blood and Chocolate,"Blood and Chocalate by Annette Curtis Klause was a amazing book. This was the first time I have ever read one of her books and I really like her writing. She kept me in suspense so that I could not put the book down, I just had to know what was going to happen next. I really liked how she descibed Vivian's change into a werewolf, she made it sound so real and exciting. The Ordeal (the fight males do for who becomes the leader) was very exciting. The description she gave of the biting and throwing each other was so good I felt like I was actually there watching it. I really liked this part of the book. So all together I found the book very good and would recommend it for other teenagers my age."
5,absolutely fantastic,"possibly the most helpful Star Wars reference in a LOOOONG time. everytime I read a new SW book now, I'll keep this thing handy! there were some species described in various novels that just had lame descriptions of non-movie species (like the Verpines, Drall, and Massassi) making them hard for my creative mind to picture in my head. That problem's gone now, this book cleared it all up, with truly gorgeous drawings of some foul looking creatures. the text is informative too, and I love the ""journal entries by Dr. Hoole."" this book is teriffic, I HIGHLY recommend EVERYONE pick a copy up. I got it last night, and I'm enthralled with it :)"
5,The Beginning of Nice,"I found this CD after being discharged from the army in 1989: a young man with a head resonating with the commands to ""kill"" while searching, striving for the peace I once knew. This album was healing, to say the least. If there's ever a gift music bestows, it only matters if the music is made. Thank God this music was made. I haven't listened to this CD for ages, but I can still hear ""I write in my notebook, with feeling that takes me by surprise, museums on Sunday..."" Never preachy, but offering subtle suggestions of how to heal--that inside job.I hope the Innocence Mission reads this review. I hope they realize 14 years ago they helped someone heal. Sorry so late in saying so..."
4,A good mellow uplifting album.,"I guess I'm one of the few people familiar with The Innocence Mission. That should change soon hopefully. I'm not sure if this Lancaster, PA band has managed to captivate people outside of the state, but I'd recommend this band for anybody who likes folk music with a little ethereal mix thrown in. Think of Joni Mitchell meshed with Kate Bush.Borderline Christian rock...but the music deals more with family themes rather than religious ones. The lyrics are emotional, and the music is relaxing. It makes for pefect background music when old friends visit."
5,AWESOME!!!!!,A friend bought this album for me and I've fallen in love with the Innocence Mission! The songs on this album are all brilliant and Karen's voice compliments the songwriting similar to Kate Bush. DEFINATLY worth buying!!!
2,This band is wonderful but their first album is average,"I started out with the Innocence Mission's ""Glow"" and was charmed to my toes. Lovely, lovely album. If you want to own something of theirs buy ""Glow"" or ""Birds of My Neighborhood."" Unfortunately, due to the advice of others on this site I bought the first two albums, ""Innocence Mission"" and ""Umbrella"" thinking I couldn't go wrong with this band. It was a bad idea. They have nothing of the same artistry of the latter albums. They sound a bit too eighties-ish."
3,"Beautiful voice, beautiful music, lyrics need work","This is a CD I would have love if I discovered Innocence Mission as a teenager. As an engaged woman in my late 20s, I find the lyrics to be quite childish. Medjugorje is simplistic- the lyrics could have demonstrated a child-like trust in GOD, rather, they reflect a third grader's interpretation of the pilgrimage. I just can't relate to the other songs. I Remember Me is probably the best, lyrics- wise."
3,The Weakest of the Four Albums,"It continues to puzzle me why this album seems to everyone's favorite. It is overproduced and badly executed. I am a huge Innocence Mission fan. I love the other three albums, especially ""Birds.."" and ""Glow."" This debut album simply does not measure up. It earns 3 stars only because of a few standout songs including ""Medjugorie,"" ""Notebook,"" and ""Surreal."""
1,Not Everything I Expected,"Okay, this single has some awesome remixes of 'How Many Licks', but what's up with all the 'Clean Versions', this is Lil' Kim, the truly unresticed chic, who says everything and anything, and there is only a clean version, I feel like I am listening to a 'Kiddy' Version of the single. Deffinetly not a good one from the orginal QBee."
1,Not at all what you may think it is,I agree with everyone else... this cd wasn't what I expected. I am glad now they say it is all clean versions of the song because when I bought it there was no mention of all the songs being clean. I mean everything was watered down so much I couldnt enjoy the song. I mean even the video was different. I only listen to the radio edit because that is what hooked me on the song to begin with. If you want the full sting of the Queen Bee I'd wouln't get this one.
4,Pretty nice bits.,"These were my first CMT bits, among my Whiteside a freud bits. They do cut pretty well, but the quality seems to be less than whiteside and freud. The orange paint isnt nearly as nice as frueds red anti friction paint, and is not smooth at all. All in all these are pretty good, but the price I paid for these was too much. White side seems to be cheaper, and much higher quality. I rate these 3.5."
2,I could not relate to this movie.,"I did not finish the movie. I could not see or get the point of this movie. May it was about love and poetry, but I didn't get it."
2,mediocre movie,The story line was weak and the gay theme was equally weak. The acting was hit or miss depending on the character and act.
4,"It's A Trag Invasion, 4.5 Stars!","Intelligent Hoodlum aka Tragedy drops a gem with his self-titled debut. Trag showed his lyrical skills on Marley Marl's In Control Volume I, but on this album Trag shows us his versatility through his Pro-Black militant stance. Tracks like Black & Proud, Trag Invasion, Back To Reality & No Justice No Peace are without doubt definite classics. Let's not forget the classic of all classics Arrest The President (the verdict is still out on Obama) is still the ultimate in ya face political anthem. Too balance Tragedy's political tracks he drops jams like Game Type, Party Animal & Microphone Check. It's too bad in the mid 90's Tragedy went from one of the youngest, brightest & talented grassroots emcees to a mainstream, mafioso, thug type of rapper. I rather remember the ""hoodlum"" who transformed into an ""intelligent"" emcee than the ""hoodlum"" who transformed into an ""intelligent"" emcee then transformed back into a ""thug."" Now, that's a tragedy!"
4,Pleasant Surprise!,"Stumbled across Mr. Cattie's novel on a website review board... thought I'd check it out, as I have read all sorts of Arthurian literature... what a pleasant surprise! I understand that this is a first novel, and of course, there are some minor ""first-novel issues,"" but overall, I must applaud a fine first effort from Mr. Cattie! His comfortable narrative style comes through-- the man can write-- and his depiction of the Arthurian legend, while of course ringing familiar in some aspects (as it should!), manages to draw up a unique perspective in spite of its familiarity! He's put the question ""how"" to task with regard to the legend, and has ""explained"" the story in an interesting, plausible manner! Overall, I liked the story! Does it go on?"
3,ARD RIGH: THE SWORD ON THE STONE Needs Proofreading!,"I've read just about every Arthurian novel written. This version has new twists on old traditions. Overall, it was a great storyline. However, the glaring typos drove me crazy and at times were extremely distracting and disruptive to the story. Mixing synonyms hear for here was particularly maddening. Also, the use of though instead of thought was also rampant in the novel.It would have been a much more enjoyable read if these and many other typos were not in the book! The story and the characters deserved correct grammar and spelling! It's a shame as I would have rated this novel much higher if the errors didn't detract from the excellent tale of King Arthur told a little differently."
5,How to be a man after God's own heart.,Tom Sirotnak gives a one-two-punch on basic Biblical truth. These books are full of stories about mighty men and women who stand for God no matter what. They are full of stories of professional athletes that have played to glorify God. Tom has been given such a gift of motivating young men ( as well as women ) to raise up and be leaders for Christ. There is a study guide after every chapter. I high recommend you keep a journal. You will be amazed about how God will use these books to mature you in Him.
5,A good book to read,"This book is EXCELLENT! How to Make Money Teaching Guitar is a very helpful, informative and it is very easy to read. It give us everthing we need to teach guitar. This book have also gave me a very good idea where I have to work on my playing and help me to plan my own learning. I would highly recommend this book for every guitarist (teachers or not)."
5,quick service,A great product and SHARP. we have ordered more from another set.......... ............... .............. ................. ......................... .................. ...... ......... ...................
1,If you love burping up tumeric for hours... this is your product,"Unless you love the repeated taste of turmeric- do not purchase this product... besides it is only 50% turmeric rhizome - the say 250 mg and the remainder is Curcumin - 250 mg.... I have taken turmeric for 6 months - 500 mg and had no repeat of it's flavor... however this product keeps the flavor coming long after you consumed the supplement. Save your money, purchase a better made product."
2,Item Description is misleading,"While the item description is technically 100% accurate, it leads the reader to believe that the 500mg of Turmeric is all of the same type. However, the bottle clearly says that each capsule contains 250 mg of Tumeric that is rated for potentcy and another 250 mg of Turmeric that is unrated. If the item description was accurate, I would not have purchased this brand, but would have purchased another."
3,why me?,"In grade 9 my teacher made me read this book. Now I have read it and seen the movie. I am 39, and I still need to watch the movie every time its on T.V. Why me?Please allyou people, don't read it. you'll be John Ball Junkies."
3,A book on prejudice,"I read this book as novel in school and Iwas wondering if anyone out there had a character sketches for Bill Gillespie, Virgil Tibbs, and Sam Wood."
3,Just another book,"This book is not bad at all, but it isn't good either, if you read it you will have a nice time, but at the end of it you will have nothing, is a good reading if you don't have another book to read, the story of the black investigator is simple and is not a page turner book, so maybe you won't finish it."
4,"A must see for fans of the ""87th Precinct"".","Ed McBain's long running series of mystery novels (from 1957 to this year!) about the quirky cops of an inner city precinct comes to glorious life in this movie.Quite funny in places, with suprising spurts of violence, a very well done movie!Note: When this movie aired on ABC back in the 70's, it recieved a lot of flack for inspiring a real-life violent incident in Boston, causing more nattering about the ""violence on TV""."
3,"Good music, horrible audio quality",Don't buy this album. The recording has horrible audio quality - it was recorded with audience mics and it turned out sounding horrible. If you want a good Just Hinds live set buy the album where he was backed back John Brown's Body at the Grassroots festival.
1,Not what it looks like,I ordered this bulb thinking I was getting a bulb with led's in it but what I got was a metal covered with I do not know inside. Yje picture shown and the item I received have nothing in common.
3,Offers successful classroom practices,"Offers successful classroom practices that encourage students to learn purposefully and constructively by reflecting on their own learning processes and, in particular, by making connections between what they read--whether verbal or visual texts--and the lives they lead. Extending from middle and high school through college composition and English education classrooms, this book provides practical and innovative ideas to establish a climate that supports reflection."
4,If you're only going to listen to one Buddy Rich album:,"These tracks capture the early fire and excitement of the Rich band. His sidemen were OUTSTANDING players, and blended like no other big band. Menza's circular-breathing cadenza in Channel 1 is THE zenith for every reed player; Boice and Trimble are unequaled for range, clarity, and technical expertise; the trumpet section is tight, sharp, and clean WAY UP there. Yet, it's Buddy's percussion (not mere drumming) which is the catalyst! West Side and Channel 1 MUST be consumed by every drummer...the one-handed press rolls alone are a clinic!A must for anyone thinking themselves a jazz listener."
2,Humility? Reticence? Anything?,"Listening to the first cut, I'm thinking, ""Yeah, alright."" By the 4th or 5th cut I'm thinking, ""Let me outta here.""Buddy's drumming becomes so insistent, so look-at-me, so in-your-face (""Big Swing Face"" indeed) that it fatigues the poor listener. So much of big-band drumming is when NOT to play, a lesson that Buddy evidently did not learn. ""Art lies in the concealment of art,"" as someone wise once said. There's a reason why he is held in such low esteem among the players. It's all about Buddy."
1,Pretty but not useful,"Beware of this book if you, like me, are pregnant and trying to find the perfect Irish name before your baby is born. The book is very pretty and informative about the names it actually has. However, although it has 90 pages of names there are only 1-3 names per page and several pages have pictures with no names. In fact, it has only 80 boy's names and 71 girl's names. I believe they took the most popular names and gave the reader a paragraph on the origin of each, which is nice but now I still need to buy another book to make sure I've also considered the many more obscure Irish names for my baby."
4,anne roos- A WONDERFUL GIFT-by jennifer wilson,"anne roos has some delightful music for any occasion, and weddings are no exception. this original and creative combo of celtic wedding customs and music is an original tidbit as a wedding or shower gift that will be appreciated for years. anne doesnt disapoint. this deserves a 5 star rating."
1,It cannot be played at all,"We were so excited when the cd arrived, when we put it in it said not compatible in this area, how can we get a re[placement or our money back"
1,"The movie is great, format stinks!","I bought the movie for my daughter because she loves it, its a great, fun movie. However, it came in European format so its a super hassle. We will return it or find out how to change the format. Since I bought it from a US source, I expected the US format; it was not specified as being in the Euro format. Therefore we are very disappointed in this purchase."
4,The Hallelujah Trail,"We originally owned a VHS copy which no longer works and so we need a replacement and also we enjoy old movies ,"
2,DVD Review (NON Anamorphic),"As others have mentioned there are artifacts on the DVD transfer. Plus ..... this DVD is NOT Anamorphic as stated. My copy is 4x3 LETTERBOX with either 2.20 or 2.35 screen format.Studios still need to release a proper transfer, because mine being LETTERBOXED I have to Zoom which magnifies the image to fill the 52"" WS LCD so there are less black bars top and bottom. This means I see the artifacts even more in Zoom mode ... ;-)Well at least I have the movie !! Hope this review helps others !!"
4,Good Flick!,"This was an entertaining film, epecially the performances of Burt Lancaster, Lee Remick, the ""Good Republican""....Brian Keith, and Robert Wilke. Though none of these fine actors are generally known for their comedic talents, they pull off this whiskey tale in style!"
1,Wrong region,DVD was the wrong region and would not play on my dvd/ bluray player. It did work on my computer because I could to the region they sent me.
3,"Good Movie, Bad DVD","The Hallelujah Trail deserved better than this. The original movie was filmed amid the gorgeous summer New Mexico scenery in Ultra-Panavision 70 on 70mm film which should have afforded anyone wishing to make a DVD transfer the opportunity to produce an exceptional product, right? Wrong!The letterboxed image is further reduced within the frame on the 16:9 screen (a rectangle within a rectangle); the picture is grainy, contrasty, and generally all around sucks. I was so upset at what I was seeing that I didn't even notice if the sound was any good or not.Rent it if you must watch it, but don't waste your money purchasing it."
4,Great Movie--Poor Quality DVD,"When this movie came out it was rumored around Florida State University that it was written in a week as a bet among friends; the author claimed he could write a novel in a week. He did it and won $100.00 in the bet. I recently saw this for the third time, the first in a theater. I said from the beginning the author deserved his prize.I have remembered this movie, and recommended it, for 43 years. I still recommend it. The acting is good, as you would expect, and it is a movie suitable for the whole family. Thid movie will teach you nothing about history or politics, it has no social value to promote--not even abstinence. What it will do is make you laugh.Enjoy it."
4,One of my favorite movies,"The Hallelujah Trail is one of my favorite movies. The only negative issue I have with this particular DVD is that it has portions of the original film blacked out. You can hear the sound track but there is NO picture, only a black screen. This black-out occurs during the opening credits, during it's intermission and, at the end, when the final credits should be rolling. I happen to enjoy the artwork for the opening, mid and closing of the ""Hallelujah Trail"". It is very disappointing not having it included in this DVD. Having to sit through 2 -3 minutes of a black screen before the story begans is a bummer. I still love the movie, though, and I'm glad I bought it."
2,Simply awful Western,"A great cast was wasted in this non-funny ""comedy""/Western. Way too long, with too many characters that had nothing to do but look stupid. Burt Lancaster tries, as does Donald Pleasence, but the rest of the cast just looks lost. The script is simply chaotic and everyone's timing seems off."
3,HALLELUHAH TRAIL,I choose this rate because wrong copy of VHS was sentI like the movie.But play it on my VHS player
5,what a hoot!,"This movie is hilarious. Too funny. A lot of fun, great scenery,good story line. Loved the dust storm scenes. What a nice movie. Cast is awesome. I highly recommend it."
4,"Hallelujia, now I see it !!!","John Sturges directed so many of my favorite films, from ""The Great Escape"" to ""The Magnificent Seven"", that I have to pay hommage to his great humorous homage to The West. One of the earliest films to lampoon it's leads (but nicely) it stands out as both a tribute to all the great Westerns as well as a campy send-up as well.And what a cast! Burt Lancaster demonstrated a talent for comedy that I would never have thought at the time. And Jim Hutton, Brian Keith, Lee Remick....One of Sturges' regular contributers, Elmer Bernstein wrote an emcompassing score that went right to the heart of things.Very recommended, especially if you loved westerns."
1,Poor Quaility From MGM,"I was looking forward to seeing one of my favorite western films on widescreen DVD for the first time. How disapointing! The Hallelujah trail was full of white spots(film burns) and the picture in spots would shimmer so much that it was almost unwatchable. I would expect this kind of DVD transfer and quality from Good Times Video and other cheap companies, but not MGM. They should have taken the time to find a good quality copy of the film to transfer or touched up the master to preserve this classic western film. Hopefully they someday release a restored DVD version. I wouldn't recommend this DVD version to anyone. The film deserves five stars, but this DVD version only gets one star due to widescreen."
5,The most hilarious Western ever,This movie stays true to the old western while still poking fun at everything about the old west. It's not particularly campy and it has a touch of romance. Classic actors like Burt Lancaster make this movie a must have for people who love Westerns. Not to mention this is a great movie where Donald Pleasance actually had more than just one emotion.
3,A great read for kids.,The story is cute and the artwork is great. My wife loved this book and I got her another one for future grandchildren. It's not one of the classic children's tales but it should be.
4,It's very useful,I'm learning English and my tutor recommended this bookIt's very useful and easy to understandThis idiom book is very recommnendable. especially students who are leaning English as ESL like me :D
3,not better than the previous~,"Hi, i bought the first edition in 1994. That one was really a good one. I liked the fact that it had 'german' among other languages at the end of the book. Today i got this new edition, and i was disappointed. They dropped the german, and I only see portuguese, spanish and french. And the page organization / format is worse, the first one was easier to read and locate each item. Shame on you, products are supposed to improve, not go backwards."
4,Good for ESL Purposes,"I can see how this book would be good for ESL learning purposes, but there are far too few idioms in the book to justify the price. If you are trying to learn the language, you would be better off looking at one of the many idiom dictionaries on the market in this genre. They have more idioms for a lower price. Before you buy this one, take a look at those and see if they fit your needs better. I hope that helps!Have Fun!Todd HagopianPresident/CEOHagopian InstituteAuthor of the popular ""Quote Junkie"" book sereies and the brand new ""Idiom Junkie"" series"
4,Good middle of the road resource,"I own (and use as a teacher) the 2004 fifth edition of ""Essential Idioms in English."" What I like most about it is that 98% of the idioms/idiomatic phrases/phrasal verbs listed and explained are pretty much in everyday use in American conversational English. There is little here that is truly out of date and unworthy of a student's effort to learn. This is more than you can say about a lot of alternative publications.On the other hand, new idioms are created about every 15 minutes in the online, youth and ethnic cultures of the U.S. and a lot of them come into wide usage pretty quickly. Most of this ""hipper"" language is not in ""Essential Idioms..."" And it's probably impossible for them to be included unless the book became an online publication updated every other day. Hey--not a bad idea. There are, of course, some pretty good websites that provide idiom resources.Meanwhile, this is good basic resource that I would like to see updated soon."

4,Amazing Text,"This book changed my life...The 2002 version is even better, but you should get them both. The map to SIC in the back is a lifesaver if you are into things like that. If you buy seven of them the stack can dub as a chair."
1,Piece of garbage,"After about 3 months, it is sunddenly broken. Just holding it in my hand, the reading can jump to anywhere between 4 to 98. I cannot image how my hand can produce that much of pressure. It is totally useless."
1,Not worth buying,I had one of these on my keychain thatI bought in a parts store off the counter for about 2 years but then my keys got ran over and I wanted another to replace it. So I bought one from here and it showed up reading pressures from really low to really high every time I used it. Upon further inspection I realized that it was broken inside and the two black plastic halves were moving. Don't buy these. There is no telling if you will get a working one or not.
3,Must be I got a good one?,"After reading the two negative reviews, I'll pass on getting a second one of these. My first, I picked up while traveling as our rental car had the low tire pressure warning light on. So far, mine has worked perfectly through a couple years of traveling. My only complaint is the small, unlit numbers that are a little hard to see."
3,Better Books Out There,"I bought this book for my young son who loves dinosaurs, Somewhat Disappointed with this book. I was very skeptical due to the limited # of pages, and sure enough, we were. For a few bucks more, your better buying a more illustrative books with captions than a small book with decent illustrations. My son has about 20 dinosaur books and this is not part of his reading rotation. Spend a few $'s more and get a hardcover book with illustrations (which is what a young kid would want to look at)."
5,great site for the money,"great site, doesn't move on its own... nice to be able to adjust at the practice range before a 3d, no tools makes it simple"
1,Most Worthless Cable -- DON NOT BUY,"If I could, I would give this cable a minus (negative) 5 star rating.The enclosed drivers do not allow me to connect my phone to the computer.Installing the driver crashed my computer so Windows would not start.Not only is this a waste of money, it will cause hours of frustration.Stay clear of this product.Amazon should not list products like this on its web site."

2,Social Scientists Cannot Know What Trial Lawyers/Judges Do,"Although well crafted, these non-practitioner social scientists have missed the boat when they accuse jury consulting of taking part in ""jury rigging"". Having sat as a felony Judge and jury trial lawyer for 25 years, I have personally seen how detecting unconscious or concealed biases SERVE justice, not hurt it.""A"" for effort, ""D"" for conclusion."
1,Turgid and meandering,It appears that one of the two authors worked on gathering an eclectic set of anecdotes while the other wrote the surrounding text. Neither took the time to read the other's work a policy I'd also recommend for you.
1,These folks are just WRONG,"Seems to be a series of anecdotes by a husband and wife team who never actually tried a jury case in their lives. ""Social Scientists"" and non-practitioners cannot really know the effects of jury consulting or voir dire, since social science studies are third-hand ""pseudo-science guesses"" at what really goes on, and whether justice is truly done. A nice book for their resume, but that's about it."
5,Holy Soldier Rocks!!!!!!,"This band formed in the mid-80's in Los Angeles and released this CD in 1990. Being a huge fan of Stryper I had to try this CD when I saw it in the record store. And like most who have listened to Holy Soldier are blown away by this band! The lyrical content is what really grabs me, they write about the issues plaguing our World. The vocals of Steven Patrick are strong and clear making it easy to follow the message they are conveying. The whole band is tight, guitars, drums, vocals. Highly recommend!"
4,Christian Rock Fans: This Rocks!,"First of all, IMO, Stryper will always be the best Christian rock band. That said, Holy Soldier gives them a run for their money with this cd. You can honestly listen to it from beginning to end, and enjoy every song. Some are more catchy than others, but they all are entertaining. These guys know how to play their instruments. This is not just a group of guys who got a record deal because they are Christians (not naming any groups, but it does happen), but a group of Christians that know how to play real Hair Metal/Hard Rock. Think Bon Jovi, Dokken, Sammy Hagar, and Stryper. If you like the style of those bands, you will like this cd. If you have this cd, take a listen toLast Train."
5,One of the great hidden treasures of the last 10 years,"This is a great record, no question about it, and it deserves wider recognition. The production and recording are exceptional--thank you, T-Bone. (And why don't more artists have the courage to do less rather than more in the way of production?) Beautiful, intelligent songs, highly evocative of small-town America, they hold up as memorable and moving over years of listening. I've been listening to Shuffletown steadily for 6-7 years now and I continue to find new levels of intelligence and expression in it. (I've also given it as a gift to many people.) My favorite of Joe Henry's recordings, by far."
2,This ain't no Foghat thats for sure-just a copy,I bought this album with thoughts of a new direction with a new singer and guitar player--believe me if you are looking for that Foghat sound-forget it--this is just a copy band with new songs that are boring--the same old rock and roll lyrics-they are not up to par of Lonesome Dave or Rod Price-after one of two playings they sound boring and forgettable--Roger Earl and Tony Stevens provide great rhythm to very boring songs--not very original at all. Charlie Huhn is an average singer with no soul and little range and Bryan Bassett is an ok guitar player-I have heard better. I guess I have to see this group live now because from other reviews I have read say that they sound great live--Just forget this CD--listen to it once and it will probably end up on the shelf with the other Foghat releases for collectors only.
5,creepy!,this is about wild dogs that attack and kill people and i have never seen it yet but just read about it and it sounds good!
1,You have to be kidding...,"There is a scene in this movie where a grown man, who is lighting a lighter in the dark to see, finds a puppet hanging on the wall and starts literally screaming in pure terror like a girl. It is the single lamest and stupidest scene I've ever seen in a movie ever. And the woman with him thinks absolutely nothing of it. Was I the only one who saw this, or did the other reviewers here all get up for a snack during that part..."
1,a real rabid dog film that really really barfs,"Barf!I watched this film, expecting something interesting. It starts off as if it is an updated version of the interesting but hokey film THE KILLER SHREWS.Expectations by the cast are raised. Some of the relationships seem good enough. Some of the interplay works, but ultimently, it sinks.Why? Because no one gets out alive. In KILLER SHREWS the people keep their wits about them, use what is at hand to escape and get off the island. Here, they all die.If you want to see a better update of THE KILLER SHREWS, watch TREMORS. It's the same idea, same use of ""things at hand"" and use of the mind.Avoid this shaggy dog. You can see that it is being remaindered for nickles."
3,Good Low Budget Movie,A pretty good movie with no costly special effects that might over-shadowthe plot. Decent acting and dialogue throughout the movie. It certainly held my attention as the college students had to use their wits to survive without any special weapons or military to aide them.
5,It's Great for a Horror Film,"I dislike most horror movies, but this is by far one of the best I've seen. They use ACTUAL trained dogs instead of stupid digital crap, and the story is somewhat realistic which makes it scarier."
3,Holds Your Interest,"I started watching this movie and turned off of it in five minutes because it looked just like a million other horror films so I assumed it would have the same formula. The next day I decided to give the film a chance so I watched it. It actually wasn't very bad. It's nothing new or unique except maybe this time people are being tormented by dogs and not ghosts or zombies, but it keeps you watching.The acting is decent enough seeing how I didn't expect much to begin with. I had low expectations when I watched the film so I was pleasantly surprised in some areas. By how the film ended I wouldn't be surprised if many sequels to this will follow.If you're in the mood for a decent horror that will at least keep you interested until the end, you won't lose anything by checking this out. I would say this film is a cut above a lot of B-movie horror flicks."
5,More fun than Cujo,"The island setting for this flick makes for a perfectsetting for this movie. It jumps right into a terrorfest.The suspense keeps coming, and all those intelligent,mean, calculating dogs are a formula for fear. And don'texpect a happy ending for this bunch. I think's thismovie has got some bang for the buck. One must rememberthat not every movie has to cost $200 million dollarsto be worthwhile."
4,PRETTY GOOD LITTLE JAM!!!,"Well produced, Good looking ""B"" movie from producer ""Wes Craven"". Features some good performances and a decent set-up. Dogs real great deal & looks in this flick!. The direction however is only so-so, and keeps this theatrical quality film from being not much better than a slighlty above average STR8 to DVD! Then another side, You know what I liked this movie, It was nice to see something other than a serial axe murderer, ghost or vampires for a change & worked well in this flick!"
3,Pack Mentality...,"To be honest, I watched THE BREED in order to see Michelle Rodriguez kick some major doggy butt. Well, she mostly plays the victim, along w/ her band of twentysomething friends, consisting of another babe and three GQ-male-model types. Said friends are just trying to spend a drunken weekend on a lonely island, never expecting the canine horror which awaits them. Many super-intelligent dogs attack, causing much mayhem, but only a slight dip in alcohol consumption. Ms. Rodriguez does attempt some acrobatic heroics, just no lightning-fast fists or kicks of fury. I was hoping for her character to be a bit more like her soldier role in RESIDENT EVIL. Alas, she was too well-behaved! The rest of the cast reminded me of any other throw-away group of psycho-fodder from a thousand other movies. As for the plot, it's sort of an update of THE KILLER SHREWS, minus the doggy-shrew costumes. Okay for a late night viewing..."
4,"Very terrifing, I actually screamed","I hardly get horrified when I watched horror movie, as I often consider them as fake, but this one sometimes get me screamed. Very good movie!"
3,"It's Ok, but its not an MP3","By the description I read ""create playlist"" and ""dowload cable"" so I assumed we were going to hook this to the computer and download some kid friendly songs from playskool. Not the case, it is a cute toy and for now will keep my youngest away from the older siblings real MP3 players."
3,good for toddler,Cute toy for a toddler. I was disappointed that it didn't include headphones. It is more like a toy radio. It has nice little instrumental songs but my grandchild wanted something with headphones or earbuds to be like her uncles.
4,Son with Autism loves this toy!,"This is the 2nd Playskool Dance Along MP3 Player for my son. The first is still working, but I always like to have an extra for ""emergencies"". My son would not have managed his surgeries without this toy. His anxiety of doctors and hospitals did not consume him, he was able to escape with his favorite toy."
3,"He likes it, but doesn't LOVE it","I bought this for my son because he loves technology and music. Originally I was looking for an ACTUAL mp3 player that I could load songs on. The only one I could find was insanely expensive, so I thought he might like this to play his own songs. He likes ""downloading"" songs and enjoys it when he rediscovers it in his room, but this isn't his favorite toy. I do like that it has a handle on it to attach to the stroller so if he throws it, it doesn't smash into a million pieces. It is very durable and has a ton of songs on it, so you don't hear the same three songs over and over."
1,Beware - no longer being made,"This sounded perfect for my music loving boy. It worked when it arrived. However, by Xmas morning - when it was openned - it did not work. Contacted Playskool customer support and it is not made anymore. Only opt was Playskool to send me a replacement toy of their choice TBD later. Did not contact Amazon as I felt it a Playskool issue to solve."
1,pain in the neck,"Installing this lock was a real pain because the length of the bolt is relatively short. I had to remove the sliding glass door from the track and lay it on the ground to drill the holes in the door frame. Then, after re-hanging the door, I was extremely close to needing a very small, right-angle screwdriver to attach the lock to the frame as a)the unit just BARELY fit into the space available between the tracks of my door and b) because of the short bolt, it has to be mounted so low that it's very difficult to get a standard screwdriver squarely onto the screw heads to tighten them down. This lock comes with an insert to stick in the hole you drill in the frame, but I found that the bolt would hang on the insert, so I pulled it out & tossed it. The lock tumbler must be pretty poorly constructed as I find I often need to 'play' with the key to get the lock to release."
2,great idea but,"needs improvement. The pin/bolt is too short, and it does not reach long enough to pass the rail over which the door slides to lock on the floor. What I did was basically drill a 3/4"" hole in the floor and place a stainless steel piece of pipe protruding about one inch over the floor, inside the rail, so that the bolt lock there, problem solved, works great but2 stars for all the trouble involved in installing."
3,"Cool, but a REAL PAIN to assemble","I ordered two of these. Both arrived quickly, but the assembly was EXTREMELY confusing, lengthy, and difficult. It took me about 45 minutes to get the first one together and the parts kept coming apart before the next step could be done. Quite frankly, I don't think it is even possible for a single adult to complete the assembly alone, it took two of us. Furthermore, one of the Megazookas was missing a critical part. Normally, products like this have a quick access number/web site for missing parts. But, this one did not. As a matter of fact, there was not even a mailing address anywhere on the box or the instructions! The only choice was to mail it back for replacement. (The box is HUGE.)However, the one that could be assembled did work pretty well."
1,Not worth your Time,"This book is terrible, its like a detailed version of the owners manual. I bought it troubleshoot and repair a starter problem. not trouble shooting trees, no help at all, no exploded diagrams. Not at all like the chilton manuals of the past. It'll be the last chilton I buy."
1,This book is lacking,I had problems with my water hoses. Who ever heard of a Chiltons book that didn't have a chapter on cooling systems? I was expecting to see step by step for a water pump change. NOT.Book is NOT worth the money.
2,Good information poorly printed,The information in the book is difficult to read because of the poor printing and cheap paper. Data tables are almost unreadable and the B&W pictures are fuzzy. The Haynes publication has all the same information pinted clearly with good pictures.
1,This book is aweful,This book is more or less useless. Several times while trying to accomplish repairs I've found this book to have serious ommissions. It's good as a basic reference if you can't find the owners manual but it lacks as a repair manual. I expected more from Chilton.
5,With diverse ways to save the majestic great bear,"Where The Grizzly Walks: The Future Of The Great Bear by Bill Schneider is a straightforward presentation of the grizzly bear species and the tremendous negative impact humanity has had on it. In the 1970s, the lower 48 states had a scant 1000 grizzly bears living in just 2 percent of their former range. Today the grizzly populations strain the limited carrying capacity of their wilderness home compelling them to expand their activities into nontraditional habitats. Diverse ways to save the majestic great bear from the ruthless throttle of civilization are the prime focus of this involving and strongly recommended study."
2,Bruckner Anatomized - One Size Not Fitting All,"What worked out with Baroque music - Herreweghe's marvelous archeology of musical treasures uncovered from the layers of 19th century romantic genius cult - doesn't seem to do so with Bruckner, that romanticist out of time. From Herreweghe's hands, this music - not only in the 'Viennese' reading geometrizing the melancholy of circles coming full in the end of a world - comes in a box of disassembled bones of scientific interest."
5,THE BOOK of herbs and spices,I received this book from my best friend and her husband several years ago. This was one of the variables that led to my seasonings business -- it was in this book that I learned about many spices and herbs AND found a recipe for garlic salt. Great book with beautiful pictures!
5,Gieseking - Four CDs,Except for a horrible rendition of the Scriabin preludes this is superb. The Beethoven alone is well worth the price and the Schumann A Minor Concerto is superb.
1,Horrible Toaster,"I do not recommend this toaster. Even on the lowest setting, it burned my bread and waffles. Please save your money and spend it on a better quality item."
1,Don't waste your money!,"The toaster looks nice, but burns my toast every time. Very uneven. I have to watch it every time I make toast. Cheap. Don't buy it!"
2,Good shoes. Wrong size.,"The shoes were fine, but I bought them for my five year old, and they're way too big."
2,XW not wide enough,I bought extra wide for my son & they were too narrow. Also my son prefers his regular width Payless Shoes over these. Waste of money. Not worth it. Regret that I bought them.
4,I like this album,"It's very good. But I don't listen to it anymore. I don't know why. Guess I played it too often. It's one of those albums you play a lot, and then suddenly drop. Well, at least that was my experience. That doesn't mean that that has to be your take on things. You might listen to it till the day you die."
3,PLAIN AND UNEVENTFUL,"Robin's trippier stuff is much better. This has many boring, lightweight songs that sound nothing like the beatles. Not bad , only fairly good. way to 80's for me."
2,Humans: The real problem.,"Very hypocritical on many levels. In my opinion: Condoning fascists ideologies- not democracy, anti-gay sentiment, racial segregation (through a one race policy), illicit and illegal activities, etc, etc. I had to stop watching near the end because everything they were trying to ""preach"" completely contradicted itself! It being a philosophy or a religion is debatable i suppose....But it definitely seems like every other kind of dogma in the world.Love and peace for all man, not just one type of man.And no MAN is GOD.Jah bless."
3,too rugged?,"We purchased this tetherball to replace one we bought through Amazon 2 years earlier. We are adjusting to this new ball as it is heavier and harder than the one it replaced, and can hurt when you hit it. The previous ball was easier on the hands, but after a summer's exposure to the sun, the surface began to crack, and eventually it developed an air leak. I would have purchased an identical ball if I had found it, as it was satisfactory in every other way.Out of the box, the supplied nylon tether cord had a nick in it, that I'm sure will shorten the rope's useful life, but I felt it would be less effort to replace it at the local hardware store, than pursue redress.I'm hoping the ball's tougher hide will increase it's useful life, but would have preferred a softer one."
3,A young childs book,"A nice little book that is small enough for the young reader to hold and learn about life six hundred years ago. The book takes the reader on a journey of discovery with a nine year old boy named Thomas Middleton. With Thomas the young student will learn about family life, apprentices, journeymen and going to school. By accompanying Thomas the student will go shopping in the town and learn about the unsanitary conditions of the times. The student will visit a workshop, take a trip to a monastery, go to a village and conclude by learning about living inside a castle. The book has adequate illustrations. This book can be used with young ones who do not read yet as the parent can read the captions while the child looks at the various pictures. A child will love to hold and look at the pictures. A nice small book for growing minds."
3,TSA padlocks,"Lews N Clark TSA padlocks are very cheap build,already two of them have broken,I do not recommend to buy,thy are cheap in price and quality."
4,Inside Tom's Diner,"Suzanne Vega has put together an eclectic compilation of various themes of her song ""Tom's Diner"", including the one that started it all-DNA featuring Suzanne Vega. One of the best cuts off the album is ""Daddy's Little Girl"" by Nikki D., who turned the song about a diner into one about a teenage girl facing an unwanted pregnancy. Another is ""Waiting at the Border"" about a female soldier in combat during Operation Desert Storm. Jeannie's Diner is a song about, what else, I Dream of Jeannie. If you watch Nick At Nite, you probably have heard the song in the ads for show. Some of the other songs on the album include versions done in German, Reggae, Rap and one-Tom's ? by Bingo Hand Job-that is just plain weird. I highly recommend this album, but suggest you follow Suzanne's advice, which is ""not to play these songs from begining to end, but to skip around and find the ones you like. It's all in fun."""
5,"Casandra Wilson and ""Tupelo Honey""","I am Texas born, and am used to listening to Jerry Jeff Walker, Guy Clark, and other Austin, Texas singers--do not have much of a jazz background. But I am blown away by the music of Cassandra Wilson in ""Blue Light 'Til Dawn'--she has such a brilliant voice, and amazing skills of interpretation, as she transposes songs from many genres. 'Tupelo Honey' is now on my favorite play list along with 'Blue Eyes Cryin'in the Rain.'"
4,"Great voice, but the songs are all alike","Cassandra Wilson has a great voice, and her arrangements of ""Black Crow"" and ""Tupelo Honey"" are really nice. But overall, the arrangements and production on this album are too similar for my taste. I have a hard time listening to the album from beginning to end because it really doesn't change too much. In short doses, however, there is some great material here."
4,Slow Starter,"It took me quite a long time to get into this book and I really thought I wasn't going to enjoy it, but I was wrong. After a slow start, which I found a little irritating, the book became very absorbing and a really good read."
4,Reads as real life,"I enjoyed this CD as I drove to and from work. I laughed out loud and cried real tears.Suzanna is Almost forty and not happy with her life or her marraige. She opens the Emporium in an attempt to fulfill her life.Suzanna, the abandoned daughter of her fathers first wife feels responsible for her mothers death among other dissatifactions. Through the shop, she makes friends with Jesse and others who help her become herself. She finds the truth of her abandonment from Vivi, her ""stepmom"". All the characters are as real as your own Grandma Rose who needs a nursing home but you can't do that to family. I usually read horror, but this has the real life horrors and real life pleasures that kept me enrapt to this wonderful book. The ending is perfect and the mid-book trauma with Jesse is heart wrenching."
3,Not a patch on 'Me before you'.,"I found this Jojo Moyes novel rather disappointing, especially after reading 'Me before you' which I thoroughly enjoyed despite its theme. Somehow or somewhere, I 'lost' the thread of this novel and found the characters 'two-dimensional' and 'contrived'. So I hope she returns to modern-day themes with her gritty humour and insightful writing."
2,Too many narrators,"This was an ok read, but having read several of her others it was a bit disappointing. Too many narrators, felt too bitsy, the author addressed important themes of family identity & domestic violence, but it didn't quite gel."
2,Too Heavy,Description said light fragrance but when applied was too heavyThis fragrance is not what I expected at all !!!!!
2,Eh...,"This is an okay fragrance, but it doesn't have great staying power. I also think it's a bit masculine, at least for my taste. Would suggest passing on this one."
3,Sisters Love brings a Sci-Fi Time Travel adventure,"Stars:Gigi Perreau Robert Pike Daniel`Time Again' kind of has a cable movie vibe, There seems like a stopping of tension/violence/pacing .Really like the chemistry of actresses playing the sisters in main plot and the cop character adds alot to story telling.Mentioned that this movie almost succeeds on many levels and yet holds back on details,That telling a science fiction plot needs.The gun/shooting effects are great and seem real and add so much to making film cross over to action/adventure to science fiction.To have character actors like GiGi and Robert to fill in some lines to the young leads makes so much sense for this film to entertain as it does."
2,Wrong songs shown in original for sale listing,on the site where Interiors CD is listed for sale they show the track listing and it is 100% wrong. None of these songs are on the Interiors CD. I find now that music listed is on Kings Record Shop.I was very happy with the handling and shipping time but not with the product as it was not correctly represented.
1,Isn't what I expected,"It's not exactly ""whisper-quiet""; we located it in the study, off the master bedroom, and it's very loud. After running for about a month, the lowest fan setting broke and we were forced to run it on ""medium"" which is even louder. Even though it has an ionizer, it never smelled like our Sharper Image ionizers do. I don't think it was doing anything!"
5,SEATBELT SUSPENSE AT ITS BEST,"Annie Kingston is desperate. Not only does she cry out to God to stop the string of senseless serial murders plaguing her town of Redding, her son suffers from the devastating affects of drug abuse. As a forensic artist, her heart is touched by the victims' sufferings. But when one of them is someone she knows personally, the murders take on an even more horrific nature. While Collins draws the reader into Annie's heart, she also sensitively portrays the inner workings of an evil mind. Using the same skills, the author demonstrates the power of prayer. This story will chill, thrill, and fill you. If you dare to set it down, it will haunt you until you've come to its spine-tingling conclusion. Dead of Night is a great read, a page-turner told by an expert storyteller."
5,Intense,"That is the one word I can think of for this book. It is wonderfully crafted and amazingly told. A powerful story and subject that will make you review your faith. You better strap on your seatbelt when you open the first page because the action starts and doesn't let up until the suprising twist at the end. The best suspense book I've read. I don't want to give any of it away, I want each of you to enjoy every nail biting moment of it so I will say only this....Buy It Now!"
1,"Disappointing, hollow arguments","While the essays in this book were supposed to lay a basis for Intelligent Design, they instead dance around several obvious flaws in their logic. First, Dembski is a mathematician and mathematics is not a science (though very useful for scientists) because in math, things are true because their logic is sound. But in science, things are true because the evidence backs them up. This is the reason mathematicians can talk about n-dimensional spaces and physicists shrug off such talk. Dembski's essay only includes examples of man-made objects... he never has a natural example.Second, the essays never quite nail down the definition of complexity. And you will never get your foot in the door of Science if you can't nail down a definition.If you want to read what they have to say, you don't need to buy this book. A quick google search can get you the essentials of these essays for free."
1,This is unfortunate and misleading.,"A previous reviewer asks why, since this book has been published, has no one refuted it? Look a little more. ""Intelligent Design Creationism and It's Critics"" includes reviews by some of the formost scientists in the world. Essentially, Behe's argument is the same as William Paley's and fails the same way. After 150 years, Darwin's idea has become solid fact. Over time the holes keep getting filled in with more knowledge but there will always be new details to understand. Arguing that the idea is wrong because you don't understand a detail is disingenous at best."
1,Let's pretend science,"This appears to be a creationist attempt to sucker conservative Catholics into joining up with know-nothing fundamentalists on the issue of evolution. The fundamentalists would be better off sticking to abortion as a point of agreement. The creationists certainly have not convinced the scientific community of ""intelligent design"", but are trying to snow the religious and political communities into buying their nonsense."
5,The Core of Design,"If you want to know what is at the core of intelligent design, this is the book. With essays by Behe, Meyer & Dembski, this offers a rare multi-author volume that still fits in a cargo-pocket.Want to know why ID critics never talk about this volume? It is too solid--they can't touch it. Plus Behe successfully responds to his critics. Instead, they have to resort to name calling and warnings of danger lest someone read this. But don't let them tell you what to think. Evaluate ID for youself."
4,gun rocks,"Gallus is a great cd from gun it rocks like the first gun cd from beginning to the end.My favorite is long road the standouts are steal your fire,higher ground, and reach out for love.If you enyoy the classic 80 sound of rock you wont be let down by this cd.I hope this review was helpfull to you"
3,A lot of history not very much practical information,"This guide is rather lacking in a many areas. Most notable information on hostels and campgrounds and such. However, it contains a lot of historical background on churches and other areas of intrest in Bulgaria. Unforunately this information dominates most of the guide. If you are looking for a travel guide I recommend Bulgaria a Rough Guide it contains much more pertinent information for the world traveler."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I had hoped to save some cash by purchasing this Aiptek, but it was an absolute horror. Jerky response; built like junk. I returned it the same day and bought a WACOM Graphire, which works like a dream."
1,why wont it work,this tablet will not work on my computers i tried it with the windows seven and with xp but nothing could it be becuase i have a mouse plugged in?
4,Actually pretty good,"I just bought the Medion PC USB Graphics Tablet which is a rebranded version of this sold in Aldi. It seems that the previous reviewers had defective units as none of the problems noted were apparent with mine. Works like a dream and exceptionally good value. Dropped a star because the plastic the pen's made from isn't the absolute highest quality, but I really wouldn't expect that in this sort of price range."
5,Really good for beginners,"This tablet is awesome, my reviewed might be a little exaggerated since my last tablet was a complete horror, but so far the aiptek has yet to have any issues or problems. For the price, it's a great tablet. The size of the drawing area and the slimness of the tablet are wonderful. I had given up on drawing before, but after getting this tablet I got out of my art block :) I definitely recommend it."
5,The Piano Style of Nat King Cole,Nelson Riddle provides outstanding accompaniment to the virtuosity of Nat Cole on the piano. This performance reinforces the truth that Nat King Cole rates with Art Tatum and Teddy Wilson as a jazz pianist.
5,Nat Cole: The Greatest Melodic Jazz Pianist of All Time,"I chose this rating because Cole set such high standards for himself and the musicians who were his sidemen in his trio. And this album is certainly of a status of being considered a ""classic."" Cole's melodic technique at the piano was endless. I liked each of the cuts, especially ""April In Paris,"" ""Taking A Chance On Love,"" ""I Didn't Know What Time It Was"" and ""My Heart Stood Still."" I recommend this to any one who is a fan of the great Oscar Peterson because Cole was one of his major influences. Here is a pianist that people like Lester Young, Willie Smith, Benny Carter, Coleman Hawkins, Les Paul, Harry ""Sweets"" Edison, Dexter Gordon, Stan Getz, Charlie Parker, J. J. Johnson, Anita O'Day and Jo Stafford had his services as an accompanist. King Cole at the piano. What more is there to write?From the Mercury Man of White Plains, Westchester County, New York"
2,Morose and Depressing,"This book is filled with stories by many of my favorite authors, which is why I purchased it. All of the stories are good mysteries; none of the endings are overly obvious, and most of the outcomes left an impression to be thought about later. (The picture of Heaven and Salvation in Susan Dunlap's ""I'll Get Back to You"" has started many thought-provoking conversations.) The reason I would highly praise the individual stories yet rate the book so low is that as a group the stories are depressing. Even the relatively happy endings are tainted with sadness, failure, fear or misery. Being the owner of two fickle little kittens I still cry occasionally when I think of ""A Witch and Her Cats"" by Antonia Fraser. I realize that it is the purpose of each of these women to reach out and impact her audience, but the combination of stories in this book turns the pen into an arrow, piercing the soul. It is a rare occurrance, but I have given my copy away."
3,Disappointed,"I bought the Black Cashmere Mist based on reviews I read since I had never smelled it before. The reviews were all great, so I took a chance and bought it. It was not quite what I expected. While it is not a bad fragrance, it just isn't what I consider to be ""sexy"". My recommendation is to always try to find a local store to sample first. Everyone doesn't always like the same thing."
2,You Pay for What You Get,"I understand why this CD was on sale. The music was okay, but I don't listen to it as much as I thought I would. If you like the old school gospel and nothing but that...you may enjoy this one."
1,Stick to Playing Classical Music,"A superb trumpeter of classical music, Marsalis could not swing his ass. It is a sad commentary of the times that the brilliant horn of Byron Stripling receives scant press, and Marsalis makes the big bucks for playing awful jazz. Harry James: Where are you now that we need you?"
2,Cute but...,"The sizing runs big on these shoes so buyer beware. I ordered a size 10 but could have easily slipped both of my feet into one of these shoes. They were also rather wide and made of the thinnest leather imaginable.The sole on the shoe is so cheap and thin that after seeing them, my friend remarked that I must have ordered the house slippers by mistake.These were promptly returned."
4,Home Schooled,I was looking for a book that had been assigned by my daughter's online teacher.I could not find it anywhere. That is until I came across this collection of short stories. Great collection of short stories. Very helpful for my daughter.
3,Memories,"I have the cassette case, actual tape long gone lol, so I ordered this used copy. Sad you can't find it new? anyway the case is tattered as a used cut-out bin item typically is but the CD itself is in perfect condition so that's all the matters to me. I recall no liking this follow up to Forward Your Emotions and it still holds true hearing it again. It's as if they thought, ""we got our foot in the door with FYE so now lets be serious song writers and it all sounds rather forced, some songs are ok but nothing to striking. Louise sounds great as usual but as I said it all sounds kind of formulaic and uninspired lacking the charm of FYE collection of songs which came across with a goofy edgy charm and attitude. If you are a fan of Forward Your Emotions and simply want more of Reny's unique vocal sound then you couldn't go too wrong picking this up at a cheap price."
2,Liked Forward Your Emotions better,"Great that this album is available on CD, but their change in music style was not quite my taste this time.Good music overall. Still good singing and pleasant melodies, some of which might fall near the easy listening category.Keep in mind, these albums are very hard to find, especially Forward Your Emotions on tape (One to One - note the band changed their name, unlike most artists do or did)."
5,3 Women 1 Job and Betrayal,I thought this book was well thought out. Such a good read it seems like the charactors came to life. The plot was great and I love the little twist the book held. The book was full of different emotions. I must admit I loved when Miz Jonnie Coleman called in.This book is a must buy.
2,No Envelope Pushing Here,"CUBICLES, as a story, had loads of potential. Work related stories are few and far between, so when a door opens for me to get a chance to see an author fictionalize a story in a work setting, I get excited. I'm afraid, however, I was left feeling cheated with this story that was filled with stereotypes, flat dialogue and very little ingenuity.The only character who actually had potential was...well...you'll have to read the book to find out what happened to the one character with potential, but suffice it to say, Ms. Spencer would have done herself a favor if she had simply chosen to write a book about this character (you'll know her if you choose to read this book).Bottom line...check the book out at the library. Save your dime for another day."
4,"Essential background, but expensive","Large and luxuriant, this volume is built for comfort rather than for speed. Intended for the coffee table, it cover the entire history of special effects with generous portions devoted to the recent contributions of digital effects artists. You won't find detailed tutorials for Maya, but you''ll be able to read all the basic theory behind camera work, optical effects, model making, make-up, matte painting, animation and audio effects.Nearly all the right companies have been contacted, from Cinesite to ILM and on to Sony Pictures Imageworks. On top of the plain-talking and superb examples of digital creativity cited, the book is illustrated with great photos and diagrams. The only slight drawback is the price tag, but quality doesn't always come cheap."
5,Great book!,"My 13 year old grandson couldn't have been happier with this gift. He is interested in film-making and had to drop everything to read it immediately. It is a beautiful, good quality book."
2,Pretty basic,"Well, it's a good, solid book about praying. I was a bit disappointed; there's nothing terribly profound here. Not even much wondering at the mystery of praying. (Doesn't it strike you as AWFULLY STRANGE that we can TALK to the God of the universe? That he WANTS us to? but anyway...)The author uses the Lord's prayer as a blueprint for how we should pray: seeking God's Face, God's Rule, God's Will, God's Hand, Forgiveness, Trials and temptations, then a nod to healing and miracles.I guess it feels like a solid, yet ultimately boring, sermon series on one of the oldest topics in the book.There's more to prayer than this, I know there is!If you'd like to discuss this book, or recommend other books, or give me your insight into prayer, or just chat, e-mail me at williekrischke@hotmail.com."
4,"Good, practical information about prayer","I've greatly benefited from this book about the approach to prayer, and have found the dissection of the Lord's Prayer to be very beneficial and informative. I think there is some good information presented here, and the text, although somewhat short, does give some good notes and references for further individual research."
3,for collector or inquisitive only,"this record gives a good understanding of where monk came from - those interested in 'historic' recordings will appreciate these early blue note years - BUT this was recorded in 1947 and sounds like it - monk's piano sound is brittle, and the fidelity is questionable - also, these recordings lack A list sideman (check out the monk/coltrane disc for 2 masters at work) the horns are sometimes out of tune, the intonations questionable, basically, poorer players are obscuring the brilliance of monk;s piano work (check out ""thelonious"" or ""off minor"")- that said, if your interested in owning monk recordings from each period, or a complete collection, this recording should be a part of it - if you're interested in more polished stuff, go for the 50's recordings"
3,Should have written something more useful,"I am handling my own business here in Manila and a fresh grad out of college.Id say this book was quite disappointing.i was expecting something else from a Wharton Prof., instead he wrote something everyone else knows already.First in chapter1, it didnt say anything on ""how"" to segment your market,such as niches,ethnics,demegraphics,psychographics,database segmentation,behavioral or whatever,instead, it just emphpasized the need to segment.The need is pretty much obvious, even in the books of Mr. Kotler, or Mr. Clancy, these are already very much emphasized. Same with teh rest of the book which did not give any thorough insights, more on just the needs, and some basic steps to follow. I would say this book is a good reference for those with no marketing background, or freshmen in marketing but not for those looking for a breakthrough in the ""everyone knows that"" conventional marketing practices."
2,Nice look and construction; but made for small people,"The bag itself is well made with easy opening/closing pockets. I liked the three smaller pockets in addition to the large main compartment. But the straps are very short. I'm only 5'7"" and 160#, but I cannot get this on with both shoulder straps. It could work ok hung over one shoulder if load is lighter and shorter trip. It's getting convert to a tool bag."
3,Nice Bag - but color is not as depicted,"The color listed on Amazon states ""khaki."" Now, there are two sorts of Khaki... There's the olive-green hue and then there's more of a beige putty / oatmeal sort of shade. Well, I wanted an oatmeal-colored bag, and I ordered this specifically because it appeared to be exactly the right shade - the accompanying photograph of the bag clearly shows it to be the beige kind of khaki. So, I was VERY disappointed to open my parcel and discover a bag that is green. I thought there must have been a mixup in the order, but no... So, if color matters to you too, then caveat emptor! There is a big disparity between reality and representation...Otherwise, it a nice sturdy bag, made of thick, good quality cotton. Good for camping, just sadly not what I had wanted."
4,Good to begin about Barbarossa,"I read this short short and full of illustrations book.All photos and maps are black & white.Some chapters, about this beginning of the biggets land battle in World's history:The Nazist-Soviet War(1941-1945).For me, I read this book for first time, when I was a child and I found it almost excellent.Well,today I'm an adult and 38 years old.This book is good to begin, about Barbarossa, but for me today, I would referto read a book with more details, about this very important subject."
3,Nice Bits,"There's nothing wrong with the bits, however I gave it a 3 star because the product description is wrong. The kits contains 5/32, 3/16, 1/4, 5/16 and 3/8. The description said 3/16 through 1/2 and unfortunately for me the 1/2 was the main reason I bought them."
2,Over priced junk,"The idea of putting the ""scoop"" edge of the side is good in theory but this spoon is too flexible and the bowl too small to be useful. My mother won't use it. And almost $20 for a piece of cheap plastic? Are you kidding?! I got taken. This thing is useless and a waste of money. Don't buy."
3,"Cutting edge, circa 1974","If you're new to a methodical approach to planning a marketing program, this book probably will help you sort through the issues. For anyone experienced in strategy planning, the book comes across as a bit reductive and pedantic.To be fair, the book does provide a workable structure that allows novice marketers to focus on the situational issues rather than scrambling just to identify the the required components of a plan. It also may serve as a journeyman-like reference for experienced marketers.One more note: the book clearly predates the Internet and is very much oriented at the mass marketing of good, old-fashioned consumer products. Don't expect to shift your paradigm here!"
2,Watch other reviews,"Barry Callen works for the author. The other reviews are more accurate. This book is basic, dry and unreadable save for someone starting from scratch with no other available resources."
2,disappointing,"This book has disappointed me. It lacks structure and aim. Although Ryan describes some Special Forces operations in Iraq, he relies on other subjects to fill the book. The larger part of the book deals with descriptions of several Special Forces, chapters on the future of these forces and their training and selection and a lot of photos. These other subjects are described in an unbalanced way, sometimes very brief and sometimes very extensive. It is clear that Ryan in British. This must explain why he spends 16 pages on the exploits of the SAS in the Gulf war.The book seems to be thrown together in a hurry. I advise people who are interested in a full account of Special Forces in Iraq to wait a little longer."
2,Not even close!,"As a member of one of the Special Operations units about which Ryan wrote, I am both elated as well as dismayed he got so many details wrong. I am certain he has no regard for Operations Security, and the sterile, vague information the units released could just have easily been gleaned from reading through USA Today and watching CNN and Fox news to put a hazy picture together. My family and friends found it interesting and might have learned a few ""mysteries"" surrounding my job, but there is definitely not much of substance in between the binders of this book. Not recommended for military professional reading. Might help with special ops recruiting, though."
4,A breakthrough book in the Wilcox series...,"Harold Adams's ""Barbed Wire Noose"" is the best yet of the Wilcox series that I've read. In this story set in a bitter South Dakota winter in the mid 30's, Carl Wilcox temporarily takes over the job of the town cop, Joey, who is ailing with pneumonia. And just before a major blizzard hits Corden, a man named Arthur Foote is found dead with a barbed wire noose around his neck. Carl immediately knows its murder, and he sets about discovering the killer, but his guests, some of whom are suspects, settle in, another man is murdered and Wilcox digs deeper into finding out why. The sadness comes out as motives come to the surface as sons go against their fathers and tragedy divides."
3,Students beware,"I purchased this book for my Global Business class and was appalled at the author's bias towards globalization. The first chapter deals with the arguments for and against - it read as a love letter to globalization. If you have to use it, there's great information - but if you're trying to form an educated opinion on whether or not globalization is the best thing for the world, look for different sources."
3,QB Training,This training video was too short and limited on scope. The training/help section of the Quickbooks Premier Contractor Edition was better.
1,Quickbooks Premier 2005 Contractor Edition,Took less than 2 hours and was very broad in the training. No mastering going on here.
1,"Yeah, Where is it?","I ordered mine 7 weeks ago, and it hasn't even shipped yet. It's April 3 and they're still including March 27 in their delivery range."
5,winter warmth,"I have several of these in the house. They provide a comforting warmth when there is a chill in the air. This one has a good heat selector however, there is one made by Sunbeam that is not safe. Dropping or moving the temp control can turn it on, off or change the temp. I was glad to be able to still purchase the safe control."
4,A good introduction to China's History,I just liked this book because I wanted to read a good brief history of China and I think this book manage to do that. It is a well written book to introduce yourself to this ancient culture.
4,Good read on the plane to China.,"I read this on the plane to China - my fourth trip there (five if you count Taiwan). It was a fairly easy read, organized, and covered what are considered the major dynasties. I may read it again someday."
1,Unbelievably Awful!,"I totally agree with Thomas Hogan! I couldn't make it to the end of the CD. I sampled each track after hearing the first one and could not believe how utterly horrible Ron Carter's playing was. It is a slap in the face to all professional classical bass players for him to record these works and then actually have it distributed. Shame on Blue Note Records - it is obvious that they have a total inability to distinguish good from bad. Sorry Ron, stick to Jazz. For anybody reading this that wants to hear fine bass playing, check out some of the great bass CDs by Edgar Meyer, Boguslaw Furtok, Eugene Levinson, Gary Karr, Edwin Barker, Klaus Trumpf, Ludwig Streicher, etc."
1,a moaning instrument,"dont much about music. i was looking for a jazz master to interpret Bach. just like Jacques Loussier. while the cd start. it feels like off key frequently. may be its his signature, not sure. i will not keep it even it cost me only 8 bucks."
1,Horrible,"This book was used for my Nuclear Instrumentation class. While the chapters were easy to understand, the homework problems at the end of each chapter did not relate to the material covered in the chapter. My homework study group ended up using the internet to figure out how to do the problems since none of us could find even a hint on how to do the computational problems in the book. This ended up being the case for everyone in the class. If you end up needing this book, I'd get whatever optional ones your teacher recommends because this book is not helpful"
2,informative and unhelpful,"This book contains a vast explanation of almost all the principles of radiation detection and measurement, but in any sense of application this book fails horribly.This is a terrible book to try to learn the info from because it offers no example questions. (With answers) The questions it does ask reference values and constants that you must find in other books or online and the methods required to solve most problems are extremely vague or missing entirely. Occasionally you'll come across a question for which the answer is pulled straight from the text, (most non-numeric answers) but otherwise you are left questioning the books purpose other than being a large and expensive, conceptually based, tome of inapplicability.Maybe if there was an answer guide or key, it would slide towards being helpful in learning the info through methods other than pure memorization. Hint, hint, Dr. Knoll."
3,The book smells funny,"The quality is fine, but it reeeeeaaaaaally stinks. and somehow it is thinner than the one I saw at the book store."
4,Beautiful bowl!,"The bowl is beautiful. It is a little lighter weight than I expected but the grain and wood color is quite nice. It is a great depth for a big salad! The only criticism I have is that the barcode sticker on the bottom of the bowl had a ridiculously strong adhesive, which required a bit of work to get off without damaging the bowl. The other thing to know is that it comes as is, no box or packaging, which is fine with me, but made wrapping it a little awkward."
1,"Very disappointing, cannot recommend","Got this for Christmas and was very disappointed. The DVD spends too much time on things like fairing the keel, where the navigator is suppose to sit and how many sails you should have in your inventory. Almost nothing on tactics and strategy, and way too little on how to trim your sails for various conditions.Lack of content aside, the quality of production is very amateurish. I looks like a father and son got together with their comcorder and knocked a video out over the weekend.Don't waste your money."
3,Well made Defender,"Product arrived well packaged and prompt. Look sturdy and pretty but not have the chance to use it yet, so do not know how well it will function."
5,"A Jazz Musician's Choic, Simply, the Best, of the Best","I have been listening to and collecting Nancy Wilson's music ( 50 albums (not CDs) ) for 30 years and I can honestly say that this is the best of the lot. Nancy's style is so musically compliant and smooth that she should be given her own musician's union card and allowed to join any band or orchestra that dares to share, contribute and blend in the making of shear beautiful music. She doesn't just accompany or merely sings along with the Adderely band, nope not Nancy. Rather, she joins, then attend, then blends, automatically and easily blends, and climactically complements the sultry and teasing saxaphone riffs and solos of Nat and Julius Adderley. If you are seeking Listening ( Not dancing ) Pleasure, than you will wants to experience experience this CD, especially Save Your Love For Me, and Sleeping Bee.....Believe me I have listend to at least 50 of her LPs, this one in my opinion is Simply the Best, .... of the Best!!!"
5,a match made in heaven,"This might be the only vocal jazz album I've ever paid for, and I don't regret it. Nancy Wilson...well, what can you say? She's expressive, flexible, energetic, dynamic, and, unlike many other jazz vocalists, her voice is actually pleasant to listen to. The only problem is that she disappears halfway through the album, which might be a problem if Cannonball wasn't one of the earth's greatest alto players ever. There's his brother too, who isn't the first trumpet player to get upstaged by his sax playing brother.The album is balanced and well paced, and has a very fresh and youthful sound that will endure through the ages. ESSENTIAL for fans of either artist."
3,passable,"Another decent Elvis Cole/Joe Pike story, with the herostraveling to New Orleans and Baton Rouge to help a HollywoodTV actress trace her roots. A lot of typical action,with aseries of memorable characters made this a very readablebook, but of only passable mystery value.Unhappily, the author rather mixes up '50s and '60 culturalsensibilities with modern views when he tries to explore theemotions of these characters and how they relate to theirproblems.He too quickly overcomes the shame of racial mixing, which practicewas almost universally condemned in that earlier era, by applying present-day indifference, and his quick glossing-overof such problems rather reduces the ability of this story tohold the attention of attentive readers.This is a passable read, but not one to grip most readers."
3,10/24,the thing i enjoy most about his books is the attention tosurroundings. I felt with this book almost as if I was withElvis in Louisiana. Also you get the feeling that Elvis reallytries to help his clients from a compassionate rather thanmonetarily. Robert Crais is one of my favorite authors. I canhardly wait to read his new books.
3,Not Bad,This is fun Elvis Cole book. The interplay between the South and L.A. works well for overall atmosphere and Crais continues to develop Cole in interesting and oddball ways.
4,My first Elvis Cole novel - not my last.,"I heard this as a book on tape - it was not my first choice but I gave it a shot and I was very pleased. The story was convoluted but had a real feel to it. Elvis is tough, but not Superman. The situation was complicated but not impossible.The book on tape was well-read and the reader added a lot to it with his great command of the mix of accents of the region.So, how much did I like this book. I went out and bought another Elvis Cole novel less than a week after I finished my first!"
2,Average--If you have nothing better to read...,"Robert Crais' tale of PI Elvis Cole has its highs and lows. For instance, some of the dialogue was funny and smart. But the storyline was boring and weak. There was rarely any action or suspense, nor was there any sex or violence. Robert Crais is an OK writer, but for a master, try Harold Robbins. If you're looking for a mystery writer, try anyone who can produce a decent story."
2,Falls short of the mark,"I started reading Elvis Cole with the five-star LA Requim--and was hooked. Unfortanately, this books is far worse. Implausible plot, lack of action, phony dialog and more left me very disappointed. My take is that Crais has really learned a lot, and readers should start with his more recent books and never go back..."
4,mildly humorous swamp romp,"Elvis gets a call to help out a TV actress discover info about her biological parents, which leads him to a small town in Louisiana. Interesting characters abound, including a giant snapping turtle. Soon, Elvis realizes another detective is on the scene, and not everything is as it first appears. The storyline also involves some romance with Elvis first meeting Lucy Chenier (who appears in subsequent Elvis stories), a lawyer from Baton Rouge. Somewhere about 2/3rd of the way into this book, the storyline changes as Elvis takes on a mission to right the wrongs of several folks in the back woods."
3,Calling Elvis,"Elvis Cole is an L.A. would be successor to Phillip Marlowe and Lew Archer. Personally, I don't think he's quite in that league. As a result, I would place ""Voodoo River"" squarely in the middle of the pack among private eye novels."
3,product placement at its finest.,"We have all seen product placement in movies and t.v but in Voodoo River, Robert Crais brings it to the printed page in epic fashion. Besides the blatant plugs for various products in the book, it is still a fairly enjoyable read."
4,Elvis In The Bayou,"Elivs Cole, the self-proclaimed ""World's Greatest Detective,"" is back again for his fifth novel. This time, Elvis leaves the west coast, and takes on Louisiana.Cole is hired by a popular television personality to find her biological parents in Louisiana. Upon his investigation, he finds a lot more than meets the eye, and people begin to wind up dead. When Cole's ""silent partner,"" Joe Pike is brought in, they uncover an illegal alien operation, causing a lot more problems.Robert Crais does another fantastic job in developing the storyline. He peppers his writing with sardonic dialogue and witty humor. He develops some outstanding characters, bringing the story together quite nicely at the end. Although the ending seemed to be slightly rushed, the novel is an overall excellent read. Crais does another stand-up job of creating a solid, cohesive plot that is fun to read. VOODOO RIVER will not disappoint."
3,WARNING - Not for gas dryers!,"Gas dryers give off carbon monoxide. Using this device on one would let carbon monoxide into your house, and could be deadly. Irresponsible not to mention this upfront in bold print!"
4,Dryer Heat Exchanger,"Works great. Remember to install the device in the right direction. The arrow on the unit will direct you. Also, might be better if you bought two 4 inch metal screw clamps from the hardware store rather than using the plastic ties they send with the unit. I went to Lowes and bought another section of exhaust tubing to make the device rise above the dryer and then anchored it to the wall. Also, I cut some material from an a/c filter to the exact shape of the filter screen for better air filtration. This is a nice device and cheap as anything can be. Good luck."
1,Do NOT waste your money!!,"Despite the non glowing reviews I read, I bought 2 of these anyway. Shoddy construction for sure! Several of the reviews mentioned that the screen does not contain the lint so after busting out the scissors and a pair of tights I realized that they were all I needed. I attached the cut off tight to the end of my vent with a rubber band and promptly packed up the UN-needed heat keeper. When June hits, I will reattach the vent to the outside wall."
4,Works how it's supposed to in the winter.,"This was really easy to install and took me all of 10 or so minutes. Most of that was spent wrestling with my drier hose. Since the air is already being vented into the laundry room there's no issue. When summer comes around I may have to take the product off. The unit itself has gaps in the plastic. I may have my husband seal it with some caulking or we may just remove it in the warmer weather.Since we live in such an arid climate this product is perfect! It keeps the back of the house warm while the drier is going and adds much needed humidity to the air. In climates that aren't a desert I'd be cautious, as it does put out a good amount of humidity.I don't feel as bad using the drier rather than my drying rack while using this product."
1,Heat Keeper - Not!,"Had one in my dryer system for about 10 years. Not very heat effective, and blows lint dust back into the laundry area. Not worth the trouble."
2,not as described,the 4inch by 8foot duct did not come with as stated in description. Would have bought elsewhere if I would have known this.
4,diverter valve,"Great idea but there is no rubber seal so the valve can allow air to leak past the ""closed"" door in either position. I had a different valve that sealed much better. Overall still a good idea. I suggest covering the screen with something to stop air from leaking into the house when it is supposed to go outsied."
2,Cheaply made and the valve leaks moist air when it is set to vent outside,"I purchased this at Menards and promptly returned.Basically, it is very cheap. The two pieces that make up the housing don't form a hermetic seal (not that you can't just use some foil tape or duct seal). I installed this rather quickly and sealed things up well.On my test run, I noticed that warm, moist air was blowing right through the vent. Granted, much of the air was deflected outside, so it is better than just dumping all the air into your house.Also, I felt that the lint screen was inadequate. The mesh isn't fine enough to catch the small pieces of lint that make it into the vent. The screen really might as well not even be there.So, I'm back to doing what I did before: remove the duct from the outside vent, point it inward during the winter, and plug up the exterior vent with some insulation."
4,Works fine but needs a slight modification,The front screen is not quite fine enough to stop all of the lint from leaking through. Stretch one nude knee high over the filter exit to act as a finer filter. The nude shade makes it easier to see when the knee high needs to be cleaned or replaced. It will trap the smallest of lint particles but not interfer with the exhaust flow.
2,Good design very poorly manufactured,"This is a great idea that I have used before to good effect.UNFORTUNATELY...This PARTICULAR device - essentially an air valve - is so poorly manufactured that it requires repair BEFORE it can be used. The plastic shell is a two-piece, snap-together affair that doesn't snap together well at all, leaving the interior valve in a warped shell that does not allow the valve to seat properly in either position.I am strongly considering sending this unit back, not for the few bucks (plus shipping) it cost me, but to make the point that there are limits to the junk Amazon.com can foist off on me.Buy another brand."
4,Great at reducing the heat bill,"Your paying for the heat anyway - so why not heat your house. For the price it does a great job - yes it is plastic, but what do you want for 8.50? The screen does not capture all the lint and causes some dusting. I fixed this by placing a cut to fit piece of cheese cloth on the outlet and covered with the screen. When you feel the air flow diminish when your running your dryer, simply remove and clean the lint off the piece of cheese cloth and put back on the vent outlet and screen over top. This is about every 6-8 loads of laundry. No big deal - just like removing lint from your dryer screen. I have not experienced any moisture issues that others have said. I've been using this for two years now.Would definately recommend to friends."
3,Heat Keeper kit,"Works as described. As mentioned by other reviews, the so called ""zip ties"" DO NOT WORK. I have no idea how they are suppose to hold tension. Slapped some real zip ties on there and it's been holding up great. Screen isn't very fine and could use a better filter for the lint. I would recommend for the price if someone is trying to conserve some energy and recycle heat from the dryer back into your house."
3,Lint Screen could be a little better,"The device does what it says, it keeps the warm moist air in the house when wanted. The only problem is that lint filter is not that fine. We took off the supplied lint filter and attached a cut off leg from a pair of pantyhose to the vent with a rubber band. This works much better than the supplied lint trap as the pantyhose have a finer mesh and do not have to be cleaned as often."
2,A disappointment,"Piqued by the description, I bought this book for my mom for Christmas. She read it and then lent it to me. I just read it, and am now convinced that I should buy my mom another Christmas present. How disappointing. There is a great deal of interesting content here, however the writing technique (or lack of it) becomes an obstacle to enjoying it. It's like taking a ride in a psychotic New York time machine: The book jumps from thought to thought and from era to era. The services of a ghostwriter would have improved this story immensely.In addition, it appears that the author is making the assumption that her readers are born-and-bred New Yorkers. She has opportunities to expand on aspects of New York life that would be interesting to outsiders, but she chooses not to pursue them."
3,I Was There,"I read Ms. Stewart-Gordon's book with great interest, as I worked as a waitress at The Russian Tea Room from 1971-1976. I learned a few historical things that I didn't know, and it jogged my memory on other items of interest. I also greatly admired the author's bravery and candor in describing her relationship with her daughter Ellen. However, I found the ""behind the scenes"" portions not as revealing and newsy as I expected. I found the book a bit dull in many parts, and it was poorly edited. I am, however, thrilled to have this volume to pass on to my son, as an important part of his mother's history, as well as a piece of New York City's history."
4,"Beautiful, haunting and where jazz should have been going","In 1991 bassist Charles Fambrough released this record in hte midst of the smooth jazz explosion and it didn't get much play, but it should have. It's where jazz should have been headed: cool, mindful of the past, eye always on the new tales to tell.Fambrough writes an incredible song and leads a band arrangement like a master, picking the right songs and the right players for every track. He uses heavy hitters and it's a shame that this record passed under the radar of so many people. You can tell he was sweating over this record as he ran te tracks through their paces.A great record for traditionalists, and a smooth-enough ride for the smooth jazzers who want to expand their tastes a little bit into the history of the form."
1,Counterfeit,"Purchased from 99perfume, this has nothing to do with Dunhill d which I used long time ago and was very familiar with it. This did not even smell good. It burnt my skin for half hour and the smell lasted less than that. A real Dunhill d used to last a day and half and definitely did not burn. I called the Dunhill store in NY and they do not sell it. The last time I could buy it from Dunhill was over 12 years ago. I had some problems returning it to 99perfume, but they finally refunded the total amount I paid after I sent it back. They wanted to charge me for shipping, but they refunded the shipping amount after having to argue with a supervisor (or owner) on the phone."
1,garbage that looks good,Bought this awhile ago but had not started the project on schedule. When I finially had started and went to use this it jammed the first time you clear it and it jams again. If I didn't wait so long to use it I would have sent it back. I now resides in the landfill. I'm sure it would have made a great paper weight. Don't waste your money stick with a name brand.
5,The King of Swing does it again,"Two discs, almost 40 tracks. Jackin' house music that will put a smile on anyone's face. A must have."
4,Pleasant 80s disco with strong disco roots,"Sinitta (born Sinitta Malone on 10-19-66) is a high energy dance diva whose musical direction seemed assured considering that her mother is stylish 70s/80s disco diva Miquel Brown. She's not nearly the commanding performer that her mother was, but this album still makes a good selection for old school dance parties."
2,Other than the remix.... not many PWL hits here,"This disc isnt compltely awful. Hitchin, Right Back, and Miracles are decent enough... the only real hit here is Right Back, and the remix is better than the album mix. Not impressed with her voice. No wonder PWL dropped her in favour of Kylie."
4,Does what it is supposed to,This is my first wireless mouse. Although I would have liked it to be a little smaller but I think it performs well. It does what its supposed to do. Very well designed to fit big hands. Some unique features like the back button and scroller are very good. All in all very satisfactory and a neat product
3,Wireless Mouse - There's Good News and Bad News,"I needed a replacement mouse, since the battery door broke on the previous mouse - I was replacing a set of batteries every 5 days or so (good thing I use rechargeables).The good news - Microsoft said the mouse would significantly reduce battery usage. They were correct; I'm still using the batteries that came with the mouse, and it's been over a month.The bad news - this is very definitely a right-handed mouse. It's ""ergonomic curves"" won't work if you are left-handed, or if you, like I do, switch between hands to reduce carpal tunnel."
4,Microsoft Wireless Wonder,"I orignially ordered the Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse 5000 with a specific purpose in mind. I wanted to be able to use it from across the room while I do school work with my girls.Well, I am disappointed to say that it doesn't reach even that far away from the wireless source. Not even when I place the wireless source out onto the floor.Aside from that disappointment, I am happy with the mouse. It has a lot more features than your regular mouse. For instance, the magnifying feature. I also enjoy the feature of it being ball less."
3,Needs Improvement,"I am comparing the Microsoft Optical Mouse 5000 to my old IntelliMouse Explorer which was very comfortable and easy for me to use. The new 5000, as others have mentioned, does not have any detents on the wheel and even at the slowest speed selection, it is still too quick. This mouse does not fit my hand and is uncomfortable to use. Some have said it is too large. I disagree and think it is too small, at least for my hand. For a comfort rating I would give it a 2 and my old mouse a 5. From an ergonomic standpoint, Microsoft really needs to make different sizes to fit people correctly and stop trying to make ""One size fits all""."
2,Shame on you!,This CD reminded me of a bootleg item which i would not waste my money on. The music was record over another artist's CD with a different name but same CD title. Shame on you!
5,Love this band's CD!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've seen them perform twice since buying this CD.Great, positive, thought provoking lyrics you really can help but like it.Even my 6 & 8yr. olds are singing it.Brothers & Sisters, Working Man & Bottles & Cans are my favorites.Can't wait for the next one, Go Leon!!!! Do the Damn Thing!!!!"
2,fruit and vege keeper,I have not had luck with these products to conclude that their use increases the amount of time that you can use vegetables and fruits. The 'green bafgs' like the ones sold be Debbie Meyer are significantly more effective and accomplish the goal.
2,try BluApple.,"I have tried several of these produce life extenders and the best one out there is the BluApple. It sells for $2 more on their website than what I pay ay my local supermarket so check it out at your supermarket first. It also is refillable. I comes with 2 blue shaped apples with 2 refills and a one year refill pack is also for sale. It really works from everything to fresh veggies to berries. No problems and I have been using them for 6 months now. I like the fact that the apples can be reused. Just open it, throw out the old packet and insert the new one. Voila! Highly recommended."
2,Not as good as the Healthy Harvest Freshness Extender,Works OK but the Healthy Harvest Freshness Extender work better because of the shape.The freshness extender is round and the vent holes do not get covered up when you placefruit and vegetables in the bin. Plus you get two of the freshness extenders and refill packs are available.
5,Works as directed.,My produce keep so fresh in my refrigerator using these Produce Disks.I highly recommend them if you aren't able to use your produce quickly.
3,Not a good value--see this alternative,"Regardless of whether you think the disks work, this isn't a good value. One disk for $6. Instead, look at the set of 3 disks for $13.95 sold by Amazon through LaPrima Shops, and qualifies for the same free shipping as a normal Amazon order over $25.The disks are identical. I ought to know. I made the mistake of ordering both.ExtraLife Produce Preserver Disks - Set of 3"
1,Saves bags and wastes plastic,"I have made the switch from plastic produce bags to cloth and bought this product to extend the life of my produce. While it works, sadly the plastic is not refillable or recyclable. I have found another product that is refillable the EGG or the Ethylene Gas Guardian. It does the same thing and is refillable. I cannot believe that the instruction say to throw away the plastic disk and that it isn't even recyclable. The color may be green but this product isn't."
1,Do not buy. Embarrassing,These pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all. If they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these. I have lost the 3 pairs I biught to the self same calamity and always in public. Please save yourself the trouble. By the way the Lee version of these pants also do the same thing. Be afraid be very afraid.
2,Christmas in title only...,"You'll be as disappointed as I if you're looking for Christmas music. This is a USO montage by many of the popular performers of the 1960's, but certainly not a DVD of Bing Crosby or of Christmas. Bing is one very brief segment. I'm surprised his Estate hasn't gotten all lawyered up and pulled this program off the shelves. It's certainly NOT -his- ""White Christmas All Star Show"" and IS very misleading."
1,Christmas DVD....NO WAY,"This DVD was a total misrepresentation. Bing Crosby sang one song..""White Christmas""..from a golf course. I bought two DVDs. One for myself and one as a present. If it wasn't for an amusing act by J.Stewart, G.Burns, and J.Benny...""Why vaudeville died""...I would have returned them. I think there were 3 Christmas songs on the whole thing. What a disappointment! I thought it was a Christmas DVD from the title. And I thought it was hosted by Bing...WRONG!!!"
3,Disappointing Choice,"When I bought this item I thought it was a color review including several moments from Bing's Christmas shows. This,however, is a black and white version of a USO show done with several guest stars, and while it is enjoyable it is not what I had hoped for."
1,Bad product description,"If you're a fan of pop artists from the 30's and 40's, this disc is for you; however, this is not Crosby's 1977 special ""Merrie Olde Christmas,"" as the inaccurate item description might lead you to believe. David Bowie does not appear in this film."
2,Bing Crosby's White Christmas All Star Show,"Great footage of all the old stars but, the DVD copy hasn't been cleaned up at all. Images are very blurred and the audio is garbled. If you looking for a clean crisp copy this is not it."
1,Disappointed,"Not at all what I hoped for. Bad transfer to DVD and the performances were painful. Heads were cut off in a lot of places. The theme wasn't Christmas as presented. Bing Crosby did lip-sinc ""White Christmas"", but even that was not very good."
2,Bing White Christmas,"This item is falsely listed as Bing Crosby's White Christmas but he has little to do in it. But there are a host of other stars like Jane Powell who are great to see. The quality is not great vision-wise but, I guess, we can at least seeit on DVD"
2,bing crosby's white christmas all star show.,"this was a bad quality. it was hard to see at times, it was a show made for the military to show the troops for the holidays. It was not very enjoyable. But once realizing what it was, it was nice to see the efforts made for the trooops. shipped as promsied"
3,Wrong product ordered,"Good video, but thought I was ordering White Christmas! Thoroughly enjoyed it even though it wasn't the right one!! Love Bing!!"
1,Really Bad,"I don't think they should charge for viewing this show. It is history, and I guess if everyone watched this, they would appreciate what is on television now as well as the artists and performers in our time. I grew up in the 50's and 60's and remember some of these performers, but most of the performances left a lot to be desired!"
3,Bing's Christmas Show,The content of the video is great. They old film has not been remastered so the quality of the DVD is poor.
3,Not as good as Union,"Toni's follow-up to the acclaimed debut album Union, lacks that one's immediate appeal but her fans will enjoy it well enough., especially tracks like I've Got To Go Now and Next To You. It would seem, however, that some over-enthusiastic soul-searching on Toni's part imbues her voice with an agonised tone which ocassionally comes across as insincere. Don't misunderstand - it's still a good album, but with her talent, Ms Childs can do better. What is lacking from House Of Hope is the balance provided by the laid-back, reggae feel of many of the first album's best tracks."
5,Love her voice.,A great and unique voice. The lyrics are thought provoking and story telling. Love it.
3,Bold and brooding,"There is a much more foreboding and plaintive sound here than on Childs' debut album Union.The opening track 'I've Got To Go Now' tells of an abused wife packing up and leaving with two young children. There is further pain on the dark 'Daddy's Song'.The title track is the most reminiscent of the relaxed beats from Union. 'I Want to Walk With You' and the sweet and sad 'The Dead Are Dancing' provide more relief from this bold but brooding effort.While Childs' vocals are just as soulful and jagged as before, her unusual phrasing occasionally makes her difficult to understand.Childs is entitled to show another side of herself but Union is still the more enjoyable. One has to be in a different mood for House Of Hope."
4,Very good,"A decent collection of essays, ranging on pertinent current topics in philosophy such as pragmatism, relativism, feminism, and so on. There is a bit of unevenness in Haack's approach; some of the essays could have been slightly more focused. Also, I generally prefer collections which have some tying together done as part of an introduction. The introduction does not do enough stage setting - though not by much."
3,"Good analysis, but hard to read","Susan Haack writes with true insight and intelligence. Her positions, against the excesses of post-modernist criticism and extreme political cant, are well argued and incisive. However, I wish she could write better. Her book is written in academese, with its fractured sentence structure, inconsistent tone and obtuse terminology, in some places almost impossible to slog through. Still, try it: you may learn a great deal."
4,Great Album; Great Group,"This was the first album by the long-defunct, long-out-of-print Feelies I ever heard, and at first I didn't see what all the fuss was about. Quite frankly there isn't really anything ""amazing"" about this album. Unlike other influential indie groups like My Bloody Valentine or Galaxie 500 - who drenched themselves in the glory of the Velvet Underground, invoked swooning, hungry guitar leads/solos and created something fresh-sounding as a result - the Feelies seem content to play fairly straight-on indie rock, with little pretension or poetry. One wouldn't think this to be much of a strength, but the band manages to create solid rhythms and riffs, with compelling guitar noodling over the top. In a word, the Feelies are irresistable. If college rock was your bag in the 80s and early 90s, check out one of the progenitors of the genre."
1,Get one that works instead,"Terrible. Cheaply constructed, flawed attachment design, ""walks"" sideways no matter how tightly you put it on. Release button falls off easily and inevitably becomes lost, rendering the fender unusable. I was relieved when this happened so I could replace the fender with a better one. I've used other fender designs by this company that were fine."
3,difficult reading,Its been a difficult read and difficult to really get into the story. Perhaps other Anna Karenia books would have been easier to follow.Not nearly finished
5,"DON'T LIKE OPRAH OR HER INTELLECT, BUT LOVED THIS BOOK","I have been offended many times by books Oprah chooses for her dearly beloved followers to read, but this time when a friend told me that Oprah said she had always wanted to read Anna Karenina but was afraid of it and then selected it for her book club, I felt the same way and rushed out the minute I heard about it so I could get a copy WITHOUT Oprah's Seal of Approval on it. I got the last copy in town, and sat down and opened it up and hardly did anything else except read it until it was fully consumed. What a magnificent book and how sweetly it fits into today's society. It is a wonderful book, and I am now on my way out to buy War and Peace, another book that has intimidated me, but not anymore.By the way, for anyone who is afraid of a 800+ page book, I wonder if you might be able to read Clinton's 800+ page tome that is about to come out? I bet more than will read Anna K -- because that is the culture we have become. Sad."
4,Lifestyles of the Noble!!!,"You really must have complete concentration for this book,and complete concentration is one thing I don't have.There were good parts, like the horse race, which ended disasterously, and Anna's illness, which also ended disasterously. But I'm sorry, I don't see how anyone could call this the best love story ever.And if it was translated, why did they keep all of thebumpy Russian names. It took me two weeks to get through this book, and it was mainly due to the names.But I take great pleasure in saying I finished thisbook, so if anyone asks me I can say BEEN THERE,DONE THAT!!!Having read Anna Karenina, I give it 3.5 stars..."
3,Begins strong but progressively more boring,"I have read many classics, and am quite confident that Tolstoy's writing was absolutely brilliant. However, this book really disappointed. I raced through the first third in absolute delight, the second third was a little bit slower, and the last third was boring and awful. I was relieved when Anna finally committed her final favor to the world, because she was detestable (here Tolsoty failed in his effort to get me to pity her) and the book was supremely boring by this point.I recommend War and Peace as an antidote to this tome. Tolstoy's writing and mind are brilliant but here it is disappointing."
3,Much Ado About Not a Whole Lot,"Thought the characters, with the exception of Levin, to be rather shallow, aimless drifting through life concerned with mostly only themselves. How could Anna be so attached to her son and yet sacrifice him to indulge her own passion? The ending gave real meaning to the word anticlimactic. The best novel ever written? I don't think so. I've been reading novels for over fifty years, including Russian; this would prbably line up somewhere in the middle. I need my characters to inspire, to reach for greatness or for the good of others somewhere in 800+ pages!"
1,Can you have negative numbers for reviews?,"Hmmm...what to say indeed. Well, this could be an OK story if, you know, it was a short story. Basically not much happens and a lot of the story describes the land and how Levin is so wonderful and devoted to his wife. Some whould say that this is superb literary thechnique, I say that if you are publishing a novel, let it have a story line. Anna's hardly even in the story anyway. Most would argue that Levin (the goodie two shoes) is the protagonist because he represents Tolstoy's view of Russia."
4,Good service,"Took longer than I thought it would but overall, excellent condition and quality. Thank you!"
1,okay,"Hmmm...what to say indeed. Well, this could be an OK story if, you know, it was a short story. Basically not much happens and a lot of the story describes the land and how Levin is so wonderful and devoted to his wife. Some whould say that this is superb literary thechnique, I say that if you are publishing a novel, let it have a story line. Anna's hardly even in the story anyway. Most would argue that Levin (the goodie two shoes) is the protagonist because he represents Tolstoy's view of Russia."
5,My all time favorite book!,"Although I first read this book many years ago, I have gone back and read it 2 more times since then. I love this book because it has so many different facets to it. I enjoyed learning about Russian society in that time period and found Levin's commentaries about farming to be another way of examining Russian life. I thought it was suspenseful and had no trouble at all following the plot line or the characters. I especially enjoyed the dialogue between Vronsky and Anna that was written with first letters only. It was so clever of Tolstoy to write the scene that way and I found that I could understand all of their conversation. I still find this book fascinating!"
5,Love this book,"About half way through this book and love it!!!! Would highly recommend it to anyone. It is a great story and I am enjoying it. I look forward to reading it every night before bed. It would not be for someone who wants a ""quick"" read."
1,Missing 30 pages right in the middle of the novel,"I could not believe it -- this has never happened with any book I've read before. In the copy of the book shipped to me, pages 203-234 were inserted twice -- with pages 235-266 completely missing. How does that happen?"
5,Anna Karenina,"Beautifully written, fast moving and really deserves the rating of a marvelous classic. I could not put the book down"
1,Completely Disappointed,"I thought that this would be a good book to read for my AP Literature class because I had heard that it was a great novel despite its daunting length. I found the book to be full of farming and political details unnecessary to the plot, the plot lacking in a definite climax, and the ending concerning Levin's realization and acceptance of God being completely unrelated to the first 800 pages. Anna Karenina, who is supposible the heroine of the novel, I found to be completely selfish and tried to shape the rules to her liking. She thought it to be totally unfair that she was deprived of society and of her son. She made the conscious decision to have an affair and was unwilling to accept the consequences of that decision. The only pleasure I received from this book was Levin and Kitty's relationship and their romance. All in all, this read was a complete disappointment and waste of time."
2,too long and too slow,"I tend to read Oprah's picks, otherwise I doubt I would have read this book. Yes, I finished it but I thought it would never end. So slow. Good grief get to the point already. Is Anna going to divorce her husband? Is Kitty going to marry Levin?Maybe I missed something, but to me it was long and often boring."
4,A great piece of work.,"There is absolutely no doubt that this is an amazing piece of literature. It is thought-provoking and tragic; definitely must-read. The only complaint I have is the chapters and chapters of characters discussing 19th century Russian politics. Not a big fan of that topic. ;) But all in all, I greatly enjoyed this book."
5,Most Complex Characters Ever,"This book is great. The characters are really complex, thinking people, full of contradiction and reflection. Epiphanies change them only gradually. The story line never takes an easy out, but bends back on itself just like life. The characters' games and recreations gave me pleasure, as well as their various dissertations, jokes, meals and arguments. This is a mirror held up to anytime and anywhere. I highly recommend it."
5,Great Book on Relationships,"This is one of my all-time favorite books. Whenever one of my girl friends is having a relationship problem, I give them this book to read, and it always makes them feel better. The various related stories show both the good and bad sides of relationships. While the book is titled Anna Karenina, I think most girls can relate to Kitty and her heartbreak. If you just endured a break-up, this book is worth the read."
2,"Tolstoy rocks, Oprah's imprimatur does not!","Low star number is for the style of the cover. I am fed up with ""Oprah's Book Club"" getting blasted on the cover of all my favorite classic novels - and her newly-added world literature titles, too. I am not judging Tolstoy's writing style! The book is a wonderful journey for the reader.Is there some reason why, if publishers (and presumably amazon as well) want to push a title with the selling point of Oprah's recommendation, they cannot affix one of those slightly sticky labels that can be peeled off? Price stickers on book covers appear all the time. It is a great thing that more people are reading and that they are discovering old gems and for that Oprah deserves loads of praise. But get off the cover! You did not write the book."
4,Expansive and Thoughtful Exposition,"The Rosemary Edmonds translation of Anna is quite good, though Tolstoy's narrative structure impresses the reader with a sense of detachment from the characters. The words themselves appear similar between Tolstoy and the characters, but the characters are lively; Tolstoy is cold, unemotional and absolutely unfeeling towards Anna herself. Maybe this is what gives the people in his novel such life and such depth. Or perhaps it's just a result of the translation. Take the time to appreciate the soliloquies of Anna and Levin. Try to drag yourself through Tolstoy's ramblings on the relationship between the upper and lower classes. Sympathize with poor Anna. Detest Karenin for his cold heart, but forgive him anyway. Don't be disappointed at Levin's revelation; it is unoriginal and flawed."
5,This is an Outstanding Book,"I too can't believe that anyone would give this book less than five stars. It's brilliant, provides the richest of characters, drama, tragedy, everything! Expand your range folks! To say that it isn't for the ""modern reader"" is a sad statement. Maybe it simply isn't for the reader who prefers pure fluff because it does bring the reader to think and maybe some of the reviewers don't want to go that far."
4,Life in book form,One of the most lifelike books I've ever read. Reviewing this novel would be like trying to review life. How can I synopsize life? What a consummate piece of literature!
5,Great Translation,"The novel is truly great. I thought Dickens's novels had plot lines that were well entwined, but this novel is truly intricate. The main characters are well drawn: Anna, Levin, Kitty and Vronsky are all very believable characters. There is not a badly drawn character in the book. Furthermore, the novel gives an interesting picture of 19th century Russia from farm life to city life to metropolitan life.The translation is very readable. It has strange word choices sometimes. The translators tend to use technical terms to describe professions and classes, but the translators have written fairly good footnotes and endnotes. On the whole, the translation flows easily and is very enjoyable."
2,Viking should have done better,"its a shame that Viking did not give their translation of Anna Karenina the same kind of handsome editions Knopf produced for Volkhonskya & Pevear's War & Peace, Tolstoy's short works and Dostoyevski translations.The Knopf editions of Crime & Punishment and Demons, with their cloth boards, gold emboss, heavy paper and fine art jackets are especially fine and beautifully compliment the artistic merit of the prose they contain.In this case, the physical production of the book does not match the foreverness of the text. The design of the book and jacket make a it an ugly stepsister when shelved with the other Pavear/ Volkhonskaya hardcovers.i know this isn't a helpful review, but i did want to say it for the record."
1,DEFECTIVE EDITION,"This review pertains to the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition, ISBN number: 978-0-14-303500-8 Don't get me wrong, this is a great book so far..until you reach page 234, then because of a GLARING misprint, it goes back to page 203, then continues on repeating pages 203 back up to 234. Of course after hitting page 234 for the second time, it jumps to page 267, leaving out around ten chapters or so, making the novel completely unreadable. DO NOT BUT THIS EDITION!! AMAZON!! STOP SELLING THIS EDITION. There are plenty of other versions out there, avoid this one at all costs."
4,"3 Stars for Literature, 5 Stars for History","Tolstoy is an excellent writer. However, suicidal romance is simply not his forte. Despite his wonderfully detailed descriptions of places, people, and pre-Communist Russian life in general, this was just not a great romance.However, if you are interested in the history of Russia during Tolstoy's lifetime, you will definitely want to buy this book. Leo Tolstoy was himself a member of the old Russian aristocracy, and in Anna Karenina (pronounced Ah-na Ka-ren-en-ah, not Kareneena, as I had mistakenly thought when I first read it), he provides an excellent depiction (and often, critiques) of his class, their lifestyles, problems, attitudes, and failures. For that reason, this book is worth reading."
3,A good epic but way to long very hard to get done,I like epic books but this one was way to long and I mean long. The overall story was very good A woman has an affair and losses everything it shows her from her highs to her very lows. It also shows the emotion of her lover and her husband. The story is just to long it draged on and on and on so it is very hard to get done. Overall it's a good epic tragidy and it's a classic.
2,An Endurance Test,"Long, drawn out, &, at times, boring. At one point the book goes on for eons while a character mows grass! Anna Karenina takes the title character through every conceivable aspect of an adulterous affair -tediously. I read this with a friend a few years back. It took me 2 months to get through the book. I would not recommend this book, especially to a casual reader. I can't believe I managed to finish it."
2,Good Writing Style but not much plot,The book's characters revisit the same topics over and over again.Levin interests in farming is over explored as well as other topics. The prose is crafted nicely but the book would have been better if it was shorter and did not digress as much.
3,Not the One I Would have picked,"First, I have to say that Tolstoy is not one of may favorite writers and Anna Karenina is one of my least favorite characters in literature (can she be any more annoying?), so obviously this is not the book I would have selected. I think a better choice would have been Madame Bovary or Portrait of a Lady. Having said that, I find it difficult to understand how anyone cannot appreciate the scope of Tolstoy's literary power and achievement in this novel."
2,Impossible to wade through,"Possibly the most difficult book of all of Tolstoy to wade though in my opinion. Very slow pacing and a setting that is hard to relate to today. The characters themselves lend some interest and I can see how the characters and their situations would lead a major celebrity to endorse this for a reading club, but unless you genuinely enjoyed War and Peace or other classic tomes, be realistic with yourself and recognize the odds are slim that you'll finish this."
3,For anyone yearning to experience some good old fashioned heart-wrenching pain.,"It's hard to evaluate a classic like Anna Karenina with a simple star system. For its time, it is an amazing book. Sections of the book were truly fascinating to me: Anna's inner dialogue, the quarrel between Levin and Kitty, the custody battle between Anna and Alexei, watching Anna and Vronsky struggle, these are all timeless situations, as relevant in 1870's Russia as they are today. However, the farming and hunting discussions, while I understand the over all importance Tolstoy was placing on them, the juxtaposition between farming and city life, between fidelity and infidelity, and between faith and a lack of faith, grew tiresome. I much prefer today's modern plot-driven novels. I'd recommend this as a good beach book and to anyone who yearns to experience some good old fashioned heart-wrenching pain."
4,Great Russian Novel,"Anna Karenina is a mighty undertaking, but well worth it.I was especially pleased by how intricately the main characters were created and molded into deep thoughtful beings. I thought Levin was the most interesting character.How he and Anna both reason their paths shapes the novel.Like many reviewers, I too found Anna Karenina to be a pompous princess, bent on selfish happiness, with a husband deliriously lost and looking to grasp onto anything he could to steady himself to; each needy and extreme in their own way. The strange morphing of each of these characters showed how thoughts, feelings and actions can be swayed when poor decisions are made. While I disagreed with Anna, I enjoyed understanding why she thought what she did was justified. It helped me to understand human nature.This time period also marked a transition into faith for many in Russia and I think readers will like (or may not like) how Levin tackled and came to understand his beliefs."
4,Translation matters,"This Pevear and Volokhonsky translation makes Anna Karenina completely accessible; detailed notes are included, and French phrases footnoted. Yet, Tolstoy's intricate style is still respected. Very enjoyable read."
3,War and Peace is better,"The book has way too many tangents that contribute nothing to the plot line and only serve to present Tolstoy's philosophy. Don't get me wrong I've read some of Tolstoy's more philosophical writings and they are interesting, but their place is not in the middle of a novel. In short if you have to choose between the 2 fat Tolstoy's I'd go with W&P."
2,Uneven page edges,The pages on this book were cut unevenly so that when you try to turn a page you may turn more than one due to the next page being indented. I've never seen a book with the page edges so poorly cut.
1,WOW.. this was really BORING,"I always read classics among other things, I assume that they're classics for a reason so I picked up this book expecting a work of art. What I found was the longest, most tedious and most boring book I've ever read. By page 120 I already didn't care about what happened in the book. I kept reading it just to say I read Anna Karenina, but it was REALLY not worth it. I also ended up skipping pages of little side stories that added nothing to the plot or the book itself as well as endless repetitive descriptions of scenery.Seriously, sit down and watch paint dry, you'll have more fun and it will go by a lot quicker."
2,Too wordy-,I do think the story line is good. However it is way too wordy. The words were beautifully written but I tired of them & it was boring because of it. I am a quick reader but I had a hard time pushing thru it.
5,The greatest novel of all time,"This is my favorite novel of all time. If you think this book is too ""difficult"" to read, I pity you, and suggest you stick to Dr. Seuss. Tolstoy grants us pearls of wisdom on nearly every page and relates innumerable insights into human nature. He was a giant and a genius beyond all others. This is his masterwork, and no amount of hype could make it overrated."
4,Very good read,"I enjoyed this book very much. It was a nice read, easily read and flowed very nicely. I would recommend this book for a historical enjoyable read."
5,Anna Karenina new translation,I agree with others who comment that this translation is more robust and seemingly authentic - since I do not read Russian!
1,old and gritty,I normally love head on sinus but this time the product was old and griity.... I'm very upset about it. I use to rave about head on. Now I'm very disappointed... I can't find this product anywhere accept on line. So where can I find head on?????
4,Pretty Amazing,"This stuff, like the title says, is pretty amazing. I had a really bad sinus headache and remembered I had Head On in my medicine cabinet, so I decided to give it a try. It kind of feels like a mild form of Icy Hot at first, then the sensation goes down and you notice your headache is alleviated! This happens in a timespan of about 5 minutes or so.I gave it 4 stars because it didn't kill my headache 100%, but it did make it manageable pretty quickly.I imagine I can use this to take the edge off a headache while I wait for DRUGS to kick in!"
5,A thristy heart + this book + The Bible + Godly man/woman (mentor) = Knowing God (Eternal Life - John 17:3),"Seek the Lord while you can find Him.Call upon him now while He is near. (Isaiah 55:6)After finish reading this book you will know more about God's attributes or characteristics.The God who created the heavens and earth is a personal God. We (His created beings) can know Him as intimate as knowing our parents and life partner.This is God's promise for those who wants to seek Him:All who seek the Lord ""shall"" find him and shall praise His name. - Psalm 22:26God bless. May God reveal His glory to you!"
1,This is garbage,"This is poorly written, hand illustrated and the tactics are under suspicion. The promotion of this book ant the corresponding DVD series is false. It states that Haganah was taught to the Israeli Defense Forces, which is false."
2,"Falls flat, but I gave it two stars for its cover.","You want it cut and dried? This really fails at all levels. Go get Red Dawn instead. Patrick Swayze really knows how to train you to make the most out of a terroist invasion, and you can't learn any better than that. Stock up."
1,Size is a real question on description!!,I honestly hope that the size given in the Amazon description is incorrect!A 1.5 X 1.5 inch cooler wouldn't hold a peanut!
2,Pretty low wattage,"Had to force myself to finish this leaden tome. Although the Peak District (Britain) environs and characters are nicely hewn, the tale is unstartling and tedious in the extreme: good-hearted (but troubled) local boy pairs up with baggage-laden witchy outsider to solve the case of the decade. Yawn. I did at least learn (in way too much detail) how to make a pig dung heap.Spend some quality time with great material like ""A Small Death in Lisbon"" and pass this over. One can only pray that this isn't a harbinger of a series as suggested by a previous reviewer."
2,"good storyline, shame about the characters","this first novel had a reasonably different and interesting storyline, but the characters, especially the female ones were entirely one-dimensional. The women were either cliches or stereotypes, with the 'bad girl' of the piece getting herself murdered and the cold, hard type getting herself raped.All of this is mild though compared to a fatuous and unchallenged statement made by Fry to the effect that more false rapes are reported than real ones.Could be a lot better if the author got out a bit more and met some real people."
2,Disappointed Despite Good Reviews,"Although the reviews for this debut police procedural were glowing, I found myself disappointed. The author does a great job setting the scene and the local characters are believable. The dialog was also crisp and realistic. However, I could not connect with his protagonists. They both had so many hidden psychological traumas that it detracted from the main story. I found myself skimming the chapters devoted to them in favor of getting through the story! I was actually relieved when I reached the end.I don't think I will read the follow-up."
4,Good British mystery,"Black Dog puts me in mind of books by some of my favorite authors--Barbara Vine,Ian Rankin and others. The plot keeps you guessing. Though the clues were all there, I didn't figure it out until the very end. The book is filled with images that stay with the mind--after you read the book ""black dogs"" may haunt your dreams for nights to come. I liked the character of Cooper, but had trouble with Frye until I began to understand her. I'm definitely going to read this author's next book--Dancing with the Virgins. My opinion--Stephen Booth is an up and coming star of the British mystery."
4,English Police Procedural,"The first of twelve books (to date)in the Ben Cooper/Diane Fry Series based in the Yorkshire District of England. A great read and I am looking forward to the next eleven. Very detailed descriptions of the Yorkshire Dales and the quirks and personalities of the inhabitants although at times I found I was skipping whole paragraphs of (unnecessary?) detail wanting to get on with the story. Much tension is developed in the relationship between 'nice guy' Ben Cooper and the cold, tormented Diane Fry ...How will this be sustained/resolved over another eleven or more books in the series?A very satisfying, 'meaty' read with plenty of humour to alleviate the sometimes darker side of the personal lives of key characters. The conclusion was as unexpected as it was rewarding."
1,Late and Damged but good refund process from Amazon,"The log splitter came days after it was promised and we had to coordinate being at the house for drop off, so it was a hassle. When it arrived we were very excited (had a ton of wood to split and a bright sunny day). Went outside in our jammies to unwrap and assemble,but it was damaged in a way that couldn't be overcome. One of the key bolts (heavy, heavy gauge) was bent. Really disappointing--if it had been non-integral damage I would have kept it. Amazon was prompt and efficient with the refund, but the cost to all of us over the long haul for this type of damage is tough in that the cost of handling, shipping, reshipping and processing the refund for a 30 cent bolt is a waste. We went to Home Depot and bought a 4 ton electric splitter (the yellow brand) and it's fantastic."
2,War as seen by the Brits,"In this book you would have thought that Britannia rules the world single handed, no mention is made of the fact that the rickety British Empire, rotten to the core, was upheld not by the grace of Godm or the might of the Dreadnoughts, but by American finance."
5,Bringing reflective processes into practical everyday usage,"This book is a must for people involved in teacher education where long lasting change is desired. It gives a whole range of strategies a teacher, facilitator or lecturer can use to encourage people to think more deeply about what they are doing and what they are thinking/feeling. What puts this book above many others in the area of reflective process, is that it is worded in easy to understand, and easy to employ language. It gives you many ideas for using reflection in a variety of ways. Brilliant!"
3,Loved it but.....,"For four years now I have used the first two sections of the book (literal and critical comprehension) to teach college prep Reading Development classes and the last section (affective) comprehension for the AA degree students. It was a very useful text and I particularly enjoyed the affective comprehension part. ""Story of An Hour"", ""Salvation"" ""The Somebody"" and ""Indian Education"" were the best stories for me and for the students. I enjoyed the ""A & P"" and the Whore of Mensa found in the older edition as well.I found it fell short of a few things. Firstly the poems were not very interesting. Secondly I would have liked more cartoons and advertisements in the affective comprehension section. The text seems unbalanced, too much in section 1 and not enough in section 3. Finally I would have liked to see more challenging questions especially in the affective comprehension section.Loved the text but for me some improvements need to be made to make it a truly 5 star text."
5,the best comedy i've ever seen,"love hina is the best comedy anime ever the only problem i have with it is the dubing, the voice actors just arent right for the characters. but dont let that get in your way af getting this great series. i just switch it to japanese and turn on the subtitles. i love this series so much im collecting the manga and the dvds."
4,Great Show - deserves a US release!,"I have seen the light and it is the first few episodes of ""Love Hina"". Ok, I'm kidding, but it really is a good show. Animation is cute and pretty darn good, as is the music. It is very funny, with the poor main guy character getting beat on a lot for no good reason (you'll have to watch to understand - its not stupid!). I only gave it four stars because, well...I don't really know; It's not perfect I guess, and if they try to dub the voices *shudder*. It doesn't show too much in the first few episodes, but it looks like it will probably take a more romantic bend later in the series. I think it is aimed more to guys, but don't let that discourage any girl anime fans. It is definately worth looking into, especially if you like fast paced comedy type shows."
4,One of the best anime movies yet...and counting,"This is a great ""DVD"" if you are a anime lover! This DVD has the high-technoligy needed for a anime DVD. The plot is great! But it was a little different from the books. It is edited (alot), and Shinobu's story is extreamly different, but very interesting. But I won't tell you the story so, you just need to buy it to see!!! You will enjoy it!"
3,Pros and Cons,"Pros: The good thing is that the DVD does have the option of having english subtitles and Japanese audio. The character designs look flawless. This DVD will give you an idea of how the story is gonna go.Cons: The subtitles are in a small font and in yellow color. It is really obvious that the main character, Keitaro Urashima, will probably end up with Naru Naruseagwa. The plot does not follow that of the manga series, but who in the world would expect that? And unlike the manga series the DVD does not have semi-nudity. Kind of choppy.Put it this way. The only reason I bought wass because I wanted to see the characters animated. And of course I wanted to see how their voices would sound like."
1,not for everyone maybe?,"although this show seems to be popular based on other reviews (so it must have *something* going for it), i must warn the anime fan that this series might not be for you. if you like interesting, thought-provoking, original (etc etc) anime, don't bother with this. everything is a total cliche and the humor is all sophmoric... i wasn't impressed. if you are interested in the series, i recommend you watch the christmas special (which was okay) and then wash your hands of the series"
1,Pedantic and not worth the politics,"Those attempting to read this work are advised to keep a copy of a map of Jerusalem nearby. This book assumes a level of knowledge of both the city of Jerusalem and the structure of Israeli society and politics that I lack, and is moderately preachy on the PLO/Israeli conflict. Speaking personally, there simply wasn't enough crime-solving to wade through the Israeli politics."
2,Too many Errors,"This book was my last addon book to study with. Exam Cram,Dummies,and Dali software got me a 90/core,95/Dos-win score on the test. I had the first edition of this book and it was loaded with errors,had to spend time going to web site and finding each question that was incorrect and then updating to the correct answer...this should have all been done b4 this book was sold.A few ques hit where other books hadn't, but lots of others were not helpful at all, especially some of the ambiguous multi-answer ones.There were still some errors that werent even in the error log. Too much money and fix it time, not enough help to make up for it. Jett"
1,Do you want to be paralyzed by fear?,"If I could, this book would get 0 Stars. Their style of writing and answering the questions was inconsistant at best, and downright deceptive at worst. Some questions ask for multiple answers, others that need more than one answer do not indicate it. If your real desire was to be paralyzed by fear that you may leave out a possible answer on the test, then this is the book for you. By the time that I got to the last tests in this book, I was so afraid of not checking enough answers, or checking too many, that I just flipped to the answers and looked it up. There are a whole slew of practice tests out there. Pay to unlock that questions on the CD in the Michael Myers book, or find another resource. You will learn more, and have more confidence."
2,Obsolete &#65533; 1998 Edition,"This book is a mediocre test prep book churned out for the 1998 test objectives.Since then, the A+ exams have been revamped and rewritten several times over. As of July CompTIA is dumping the adaptive exam structure in favor of linear testing.Given the changes, and the new technology coming down this year (PCI express, Serial ATA, Serial SCSI, etc), I wouldn't recommend this book as a primary study aid."
3,"Well, I passed anyway :)","This was a good book, however, the questions were much harder than the actual exam. I passed on the first try with a little help from this book. I also found the A+ exam prep and exam cram books published by coriolis to be quite helpful."
2,Be very careful.....,"This book does have some merit. It did point out some of the things that I did need to study up on... IRQs, I/Os etc... Know them cold! But, it went about it in a manner that really pi***d me off. The manner in which questions needed to be answered was inconsistant. Several times the answer was just ""Best Fit, single choice."" and others, it was ""Select all that apply"" with no indications which was which.Overall I just used it as a method of pointing out where my weaknesses were, and you should not rely on it as an accurate representation of the actual exam."
1,Don't buy this book - wait for the 2nd edition.,"The book has a wide array of errors, some that are not easily caught. This book would be a good choice if it was not for these errors. I would wait until the 2nd edition was printed."
1,This book has dozens of errors - Buy a different one!,"Need I say more? How can you study in confidence after you have spent $70 on the box set, and find dozens of errors and inaccuracies throughout the book. I wonder how many mistakes I didn't catch and will get wrong on the exam. I feel like I should be paid as the technical editor of this book. Do yourself a favor and search for something similar from Ziff-Davis or IDG."
4,Great practice for the exams,"Excellent book to test your knowledge before taking the real exams. One word of causion, there are quite a few mistakes in this book and corrections are beginning to appear on the Syngress web site."
4,Great practice exam source,"If you don't mind using a book instead of an exam software package, then this book is for you. This book had around 800+ helpful practice questions for the A+ exam. If you pass these questions then you should pass the real exam. Less expensive that other A+ practice exams on the market"
1,NO GOOD. Give me my Money BACK!!,"Think of it this way. This book contains just the exact information which you DON'T NEED for the REAL TEST. I failed the test today, but I almost aced all the tests in THIS BOOK."
1,Stephen King should read it for new ideas in horror!,"This book scared me until I found some other practice tests. Questions are badly worded, ambiguous or just wrong! I bought the book and started freaking out because I thought the real test questions would be like these. It was a relief to read the other reviews. I'm setting the book aside and will make certain I come here to read reviews before I spend the $$ on other prep books. I'm taking the test next weekend. I don't think this book has helped. I like the ""A+ Certification Guide"" by Brooks (though its questions could use some work, too). I've also made good use of my ""Upgrading and Repairing PCs"" from Que. I'm not sure what the current version is, but my 2nd edition from 1992 is still pretty helpful."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK ...PLEASE,"Buying this book is wasting your money. Too many error and non-sense questions all over the chpaters. When you study with this book, you will be confused more and more. Highly recommend you ,don't buy this book. If someone said this was good book, he/she might work with the publisher or authors."
3,OK but errors,As others have said watch out for errors in this. I used Dali Design A+ prep software and found it more like the real test. I did pass though.
1,Near Useless,I just passed my A+ Certification and this was the book that I chhose to purchase to assist me in my studying. What a waste. The question and answer format was not like the test. There were no graphics in the book like on the test. This book covered all the areas equally vice weighted like the test. If you need study or test questions to prepare for your test I recommend that you look elswhere.
5,Critique from a safe distance,"The other reviews seem to know quite a bit more about Gospel criticism. I, on the other hand, was looking for something that a believing Christian could read as a survey of understanding various views of Jesus (and his life) in history. This book did the job in spades.Not only did it present a sprawling view of scholarly perspectives on Jesus, it presented all the skepticism with cold scientific interest, and warm, faithful reflection.This book permitted me to learn about a myriad of views concerning the central figure of my faith, without putting to risk what I value most deeply.From where I stand, I couldn't have asked for much more."
4,Impressive followup,"IM made things difficult for themselves by putting out a stellar first record. ""Umbrella"", the followup to ""The Innocence Mission"", proves IM wasn't a one-trick pony. While it doesn't have the standouts that their debut had (like ""Surreal"", ""Mercy"" and ""You Chase the Light""), ""Umbrella"" offers the same beautiful voice and quiet yet muscular songs and stands up well to the high standard that the debut set."
4,"truly an awesome album, not my favorite of theirs, tho'.","I bought this CD when I couldn't find their first one, ""Innocence Mission"" in the store. I had to own Karen's awesome voice. Yes, this is a great album but if you are buying your first one get THEIR first one. I have it on tape and will buy it today before the tape breaks and I go through withdrawl!"
1,does NOT work with Blackberry,"I bought the iGo stowaway with the high hopes of using this with my Blackberry 7250. I received it right away, and after spending about an hour peeling the sticker off the keyboard - who the heck thought of putting a sticker across the keys, I tried to set this up with the blackberry.Unfortunately, though it seems to have paired successfully - the blackberry is not able to recognize or use any of the services in the keyboard. I went to the iGo website to obtain and install the drivers for my device, but still no go.Either my company has a blackberry office policy that doesn't allow this, or the product is advertised incorrectly.I give it 1 star for the lack of though in the stickers on the keyboard, and lack of mention of blackberry on the product literature included with the device (even though its advertised on Amazon as a Blackberry keyboard)."
3,Bluetooth Keyboard,"Now it works, great, but the CD driver that came with the kit refused to work - hence we had to down load one off the internetA very internet savvy collegaue of mine not impressed with the trouble it took to get the keyboard and my IPAQ 6910 to 'handshake'It works now, but if you are a layman in these matters, you may find it a nightmareAD"
2,Not For Treo 650,"1) Doesn't work with BizConnect software.2) If you have a BlueTooth headset, the headset won't work anymore3) Keys don't map well to the Treo 650"
1,Bad idea,"Good looking keyboard that doesn't work. They claim it works on the Blackberry Curve 8300. Much after the fact research proves that an early version of BlackBerry OS might have supported the Curve.On another data point, the Sony Style store carries this product at the mall. Their salesperson told me that they talk their customers out of buying this product as it doesn't work. They have not been able to get Sony to take it off the shelves for some reasons beyond this email."
4,EXCELENT BUT missing one row of keys for numbers,"I just love this keyboard. I've used it with my HTC and now with my unlocked iphone using BTstack Keyboard from Cydia. The only issue is that it really needs an extra row of keys. The numbers and symbols are placed on the top row of letters (where the letters QWERTYUIOP are in the keyboard). To access a number, you need to press the left function key and the corresponding letter. To type a symbol, you need to press the right function key and the corresponding letter. I work in finance and many of my annotations need numbers and symbols, like 10% for example. For that, it takes a long time. I find it easier to type ""ten pc"" instead of 10%.I'll buy a new keyboard just for that. But besides this, the keyboard is just amazing. So if you don't need your numbers and symbols too often, I really recommend it."
5,"5 out of 5 stars, best bluetooth keyboard out there","I bought this keyboard when it was 29.99, and I should have bought 3. The keys are excellent to type on and feel better than the keys on my computer keyboard, construction and build quality are excellent, and their is no lag over the bluetooth connection. This keyboard has saved me from buying a laptop since I can do everything I need with it and my windows mobile phone, in a more portable package. Battery life is also excellent. The only thing I don't like is that there isn't a dedicated numbers row, but since I don't have to enter many numbers it works fine for me. If you're thinking about buying this keyboard you will not be disappointed."
5,Excellent!,"I got my bluetooth keyboard for my HTC touch from Sprint. It gave me no problem at all for my phone to recognize the keyboard, It works great every time and makes it very easy for me to write long emails or to type full documents using my windows mobile phone. Its great because this way I don't have to carry my laptop all over the place,"
4,Good ROI,"Setting up initial partnership between the keyboard and my pda was pretty simple. The keyboard size and key-spacing are decent...a little smaller but comparable to laptop keyboards.Numbers and some punctuations are awkward to type but other than that, I am able to type at my normal typing speed.The size of the keyboard when stored is conveniently small. I keep it in my glovebox in my car in case I need it while I'm out.I frequently meet clients at restaurants, coffee shops and other places. I pull my keyboard and pda out of my purse and I'm ready to take notes.I'm not sure what the battery life is but I've been using it approximately 4 hours per week for about 3 weeks on the same 2 aaa batteries so far.The convenience, simplicity, portability and ease of use make this a great investment."
4,"Good small footprint, excellent software","I can use the detachable stand with my ipaq to watch movies or surf the net without holding the device. Works perfectly with my Nokia 6600 and iPAQ hx4700. One thing keeping it from perfect is the lack of the Number/!@#$%^&*()roll and the ""/"" key is to the right of the right ""Shift"" key, it does take some time to get used to. Device feels quite fragile overall."
1,Does not work with the latest Blackberry Curve 8320!!,"I brought this product under an Amazon Gold Box deal. After receiving the product, I find out:* The Over-the-air driver's link is broken. (From Igo Tech Support)* The CD that comes with is outdated. ((From Igo Tech Support)* Even though Amazon advertises it as ""for Blackberry"", it does not work with the most recent Blackberry models!!!!Their website says it supports the Curve 8300. DO NOT make the mistake of thinking that it will work for the whole 8300 series. The tech support person said that he is not aware of any current plans to support this model and I should return it to Amazon. Ofcourse, since I have opened the keyboard, I wont even get a refund from Amazon.I wish when Amazon is pushing a product through a high-profile ""Gold Box"" deal as a keyboard ""for Blackberries"", it would do a better job of warning its customers of such importand product support exceptions. Very very disappointed with IGo and Amazon. The whole affair really sucks."
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this keyboard because of a business trip. It was for the Blackberry 7290, and it does not work with this model. It would be nice to see some more specifics on what models it supports; especially since it says it supports Blackberry right in the title. Customer service was not great either. I asked about receiving a refund for shipping in addition, and never got a straight answer. Feel free to take your chance, but, personally I would rather buy it somewhere else like I did and pay a few extra dollars."
4,Great product for a great price!,"Highly recommend this product. Got it for my AT&T 8525, and it worked right out of the box. The price is very affordable. The only problem I had was removing the stupid instructions sticker from the keyboard."
1,Not for Windows Mobile 6,"They should add to the spec detail that it doesn't support Windows Mobile 6!I found out only after I opened mine and can't return to Amazon anymore. If anyone want mine for $30 + Shipping, contact me."
4,Sprint Mogul,Works great with the Sprint Mogul. The web site does not list the Mogul as one of the products it works with but I found I could use the Cingular 8525 driver. My only complaint is the awful sticker they put on it. I had to use WD40 to remove it!! Otherwise the keyboard is incredible especially at this price.
4,Travel light but in style,"The Stowaway lives up to its name. It ships in a nice pouch to keep it clean and once set up provides a great means of writing reports, long e-mails, etc. on the go with just your phone. With my Nokia N95 (use the N73 version of the software and it works) and the Stowaway I've been able to deal with all of the urgent tasks and not fire up my laptop.For larger tasks which aren't comfortable on a thumb-board the Stowaway ultra-slim keyboard is a fantastic choice."
2,iGo Stowaway,This product is a little disappointing to me. It does not work as well as I thought it. Needs lots of improving.
4,N800 user,"Good product, pairs easily with N800, compact, makes the n800, especially with KDE, an even better small alternative to carrying a notebook for internet and minor office stuff on the road or average use."
1,Good luck installing this!,"Doesn't work with Blackberry 8703E which the company declines to announce. Took a week to get through to support for me to finally get a hold of them after being on hold for 45 miuntes and then to have them tell me there are no drivers for the Blackberry 8703E. <grumble> And then as far as the actual packing goes? Who's the genius that figured it was a good idea to put a sticker covering 1/4 of the keys on the keyboard? Did I mention that the sticker has something to the equivalent of industrial strength super glue on it?!?! I spent a good hour working on that just trying to get the remaining sticker off. Over all, I wish it would have worked but if you have a Blackberry 8703E, DO NOT buy this. It will not work. Also if you need help, set aside a good hour or so to wait on hold."
4,Good product,I liked it when it came out of the box. I am sure it will take some time to get use to it. installed it in a flash. However folding/unfolding requires delicate handling. Very convinient folded size especially with a carry pouch. I am using it with Dopod U1000 along with igo mouse.
5,Perfect transaction,"This purchase went very well. I received the item as promised brand new with accurate description and shipped exactly when it was supposed to be. The item was also much cheaper than I could find at any other reputable source, online or otherwise."
4,Easy key,"Good little keyboard. Works great with my TREO 750 (windows mobile 6), and worked well with my TREO 650 too(Palm OS). Has a little bit of a learning curve for the ""function"" keys, but comes easily enough with use. Not quite full sized but certainly better than the thumb-board on the Treo's for lots of typing. Fits well in a large pocket.I have used it daily for about an hour, for the past month, and still have the original batteries. I recommend it for anyone that has lots of data input to do on ANY Pocket PC/Smartphone device.Amazon got it to me quicker than there estimated delivery times too, so that was wonderful as well."
5,Great,"Bought this one to replace a damaged keyboard, paid $99 for the original and was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon for a fraction of the $."
5,Great and awesome keyboard,"Works well, does what it's supposed to do. Is very compact and portable. Recommend it 100%!"
5,Great keyboard!,"I love this keyboard. It has really allowed me to accomplish more work in less time. The unit is very sturdy. It has the advantage over other portable keyboards in that it can be used on your lap as it supports itself. It connects to my Bluetooth PDA quickly. The keys have great feel. The only complaint I have is that the blue and green function keys that activate number lock and special characters are in clumsey positions. Otherwise, it integrates well with the Windows Mobile 5 layout and allows easy access to any key programs (keys are programmable)"
4,Good product,"Works well. Documentation could be more complete. The number keys take a little getting used to as do only 4 rows of keys. Overall, a functional keyboard that will work for you and is small enough to be easily transportable."
5,Excellent accessory,this keyboard is a must for anyone who uses their PDA for anything more than a digital phonebook.
2,It Wobbles Like a Seesaw,"Other than the fact that I couldn't get it to ""communicate"" with my Sony 280P, it doesn't lay flat. It wobbles when typing on either end. Compact, yes. Functional, not quite."
1,Frustrating to use,"I'm a dedicated Treo user - have a 700P after having one of the first 600's in Texas and a 650 the day it came out. Have been hoping for a good keyboard solution and have yet to find one. I love gadgets, am not dumb, and found this product enormously frustrating. First it wouldn't connect, then it did but it was impossible to navigate using the keyboard. I don't mind the keys having shortcuts for Pocket PC and Symbian - no worries there. But I've had Palms for years and often had to try 25-30 different, reasonable, increasingly less intuitive keystrokes before giving up tiredly. Moving around applications doesn't make sense to me, and enter versus tab versus the green Fn key or the blue one... completely over the top in difficulty unless you want to use your stylus all the time.I'm returning mine after 3 days of working with it in my office, on planes, and in airports. Total disappointment."
1,"Sticky ""H"" key and flimsy construction","I opened the package and decided to get used to the keyboard before installing it. The ""H"" key sticks when I opened the keyboard and after I tried to loosen the ""H"" key again, it popped up. I pressed the key once more and it sticked again. After four attempts to unstick the key, the ""H"" key flew off the keyboard and it was lost. The rubber casing that gave the key its springy feel vanished along with my ""H"" key.All the other keys seem to work fine. Keyboard construction seemed flimsier than I expected."
5,Very handy to have,"I've purchase few other bluetooth keyboards with this one, but I like this keyboard and the mouse, which I got together with the keyboard - the best. I use iPAQ and I did have to go to stowaway website to download the correct drivers, and after the drivers were installed and the keyboard set up it was a piece of cake using it. It's been working perfectly. It is so small, that it can fit in a purse if not in a pocket. I have found this iPAQ and keyboard exquisitely practical for jotting down notes and even writing scripts wherever and whenever inspiration hits me when I'm away from my main computer."
4,Works Fine!,"I must admit to being a little afraid when I took it out of the box-- After all, with the varied models of PPC out there, who can be sure that a product will work on yours specifically? However, the installation went flawlessly, and the only issue I've ever had is that when you close the keyboard, you get a feeling that you might break it-- but you won't! I've dropped this thing a couple times, being a natural klutz, and no harm has yet come to it. I recommend it!"
2,"Worked great for 6 months, then a few keys went dead","See review title above. I was really happy with it until the ""M"" key (and a couple others above/below it) stopped working. I always took good care of it too, it had its own little storage slot in my car.The product has been discontinued. It was fun while it lasted."
5,A Fine travel keyboard,"The keyboard works very well with my Samsung i-760. The bluetooth is instant (no delay) and the battery life is also very good. compact when folded, but nice button size when unfolded. The detachable stand is also very cool. I paid 29.95 for it and it was well worth every penny."
4,Nokia N800,This little keyboard works great with my Nokia N800! It took me about 10 minutes to get it to talk to the Internet Tablet... from then on... sweet! Since the introduction of the N810 (with built in keyboard) the price has really dropped on the N800. The iGo Bluetooth keyboard resolves the only complaint I had with the keyboardless device... saving me a couple of hundred dollars between the N800 and the N810.
3,great keyboard stupid sticker,"this is a great keyboard and a great idea BUT the sticker they put across the keyboard to show you how to use it when you first unpack it... its one of those ""price sticker"" things that don't come off clean ... in fact it disintegrates when you try to get it off and leaves sticky blobs all over the keys that take FOREVER to get offi can't say don't buy it but i can say PLEASE USE A SENSIBLE STICKER ON THE KEYPAD IN FUTURE*sighs*</end_rant>"
2,Fragile and poor customer service,"The keyboard does connect and work as advertised with my Axim X51v. However, after only occasional gentle usage over something longer than a year (perhaps used 10 times in the library) the bracket that makes up the PDA stand snapped in half due to its support wire, making the PDA support useless and closing the keyboard difficult. Customer service said since it is out of warranty my only option is to purchase a new keyboard since they don't make parts available. Does it work? Yes. Will it last? Probably not. Not many other options out there, but be aware this is a very fragile device that, when it breaks, can only be replaced and not repaired."
3,Keyboard Driver for the Palm TX,"Sometimes I have problems getting my Palm TX to recognize the Bluetooth Keyboard. I followed the instructions that come with the keyboard, and that doesn't seem to help. I still haven't been able to set up the keyboard as a ""trusted device."" When I follow the instructions, my Palm TX can detect the ""trusted device,"" but I have been unable to get beyond assigning a code. Has there been an updated keyboard driver to address some of these issues?"
4,"solid product, could use tweaking","After downloading the drivers from the web site (I read the drivers on the included CD wouldn't work) and installing the keyboard worked right away. Keys have great feel. Not quite the equal of a ThinkPad, but much better than a lot of notebooks.The lack of a separate row of keys for numbers takes some getting used to, partly because typing numbers takes more effort and partly because the keyboard is visually disorienting--I didn't realize how much I use that row to orient myself. The clasp on the right near the enter key gets in the way. The stand for your PDA/phone isn't great. But I'm very picky. It's small, it works well, and I carry it in my bag everywhere."
4,Everything IO,"The Keyboar I bought works fine.The snap in of the extension does not work 100% anymore, maybe this could have been mentioned, but it was sold as used, so as long as it technically works, thats fine, and that it does.Delivery was in time, so everythning alright.I would buy again from this vendor."
4,Not bad,"For the money, this is a great item and a must have for mobile road warriors. I am using the iGo keyboard with a Blackberry Curve (8300).Like others have said, there is a nasty sticker that covers both the outside cover and the keys that may never completely come off. When peeling it off the keys, it feels like the keys will rip off their fragile posts.Also, as is common with Bluetooth, getting the two devices to communicate with one another can be tricky. I haven't used it a lot yet, so maybe I haven't figured out the right combination of button presses. But I hate when things don't simply ""work.""The keyboard is fairly solid and certainly easy to type on, especially if you're accustomed to typing on a laptop. The keys are marked with several shortcut functions to launch tasks or apps.This is a great item for anyone who wants a lightweight substitute for traveling with a laptop. While sitting in a hotel room checking e-mail, this is all you need."
4,Excellent Accessory,"Though a little bit tricky to set up, this is an excellent accessory. Used in conjunction with the Treo Centro, it replaces a laptop for tacking notes in college classes. Very nice."
3,"Decent, convenient, but not without flaws","Despite the many positive aspects of this product, I encountered a few problems I think people should be aware of.When I received it, the quick start paper was glued to it with a cheap adhesive that doesn't come off cleanly - so when peeling it off, the paper tears and stays on the keys. It's an incredible pain to clean off, and makes it look awful. I can't use solvents, because it would get in between the keys and gum things up.It usually takes several seconds of key pressing to get it to ""wake up"" and for my Palm TX to start talking to it. This makes it inconvenient to whip out for quick notes; I guess it's more suited to longer memos.Lastly, I type in bursts of 65-80WPM, and I frequently find when typing two consecutive keypresses, it doesn't register the second keypress. This results in many words with missing letters. I don't know if it affects other devices; I've only tried it on the Palm TX."
1,"keyboard, would rate minus 5 star","never worked..tried downloading all the repair files to correct the problems. don't waste your time or money. if you want other opinions, use google to search other web sites:-("
4,Very good little keyboard! just a couple tiny problems,"This is a very good product. It worked seemlessly with my HP iPAQ hx 2795. It is well made and very sturdy. I did however have a couple little problems with it. One, the little ""how to open me"" sticker was pretty tough to peel off. (like peeling a price tag off of a piece of glass after it's been there for a while) the other problem is I can't get it to work with my Blackberry curve 8310 (yet) as there is no driver included for it. But I'll do a little browsing and I'm sure I'll find something. Overall, very nice, sturdy construction and it looks dern cool too!"
1,Hard to open and close,"I have to ask someone with short fingernails to open this thing, because there are little teeth on the slide-and-press button. When I close it, it feels like it's going to break. I've been used to the keyboard for the (no longer available in the USA) Sony Clie' and this compares miserably."
5,works great and is a big help,this bluetooth keyboard costs more but is verstile and works very well. I can type quickly using it and I have had no problem communicating with my dell axim 51. If you need a versatile keyboard and have a few bluetooth devices- I would consider this. I am glad I bought it. It was worth the extra money.
5,Great Addition for a PDA,"Although this is not as tough as a computer keyboard, it is far more portable. It takes a while getting used to the delicate feeling of the keyboard, but if you have to write memos longer than a line or two this is an absolute must.The Bluetooth interface allows you to position your PDA when it is most visible and the keyboard where it is most comfortable."
1,Warning BB 8700c users!,I wanted this product for years and saw the 29.99 price and could not resist. The item came without a Blackberry driver and despite many tries downloading and reinstalling again and again from the website and an hour on the phone to Igo tech support the device did not work. At least Amazon is taking the return. The item also comes with a label on it glued so tight I almost returned it right then because I could not get it off. I'm just so dissapointed... It did say for Blackberry on the package even... STAY AWAY!
4,great little keyboard,"I'm an author and I like to have the freedom to write away from the desk and not have to lug around a clunky laptop. So my Palm T|X and this keyboard work great for me. When I have an idea, I can just pull out the keyboard and churn out a chapter or two. It's so small, it fits into my purse - a big plus because I don't like to carry a big laptop bag everywhere I go. You need a hard surface to type on, it doesn't do well on your lap. It's kind of delicate so you just have to open and close it gently. It loses signal every now and then - not sure if this is because of my Palm T|X or the keyboard. But reconnecting isn't a big deal. I know some people had problems getting it to sync with their T|X, but I didn't have any problems. I bought both items in January 2006, so maybe they've fixed the bugs. All in all, I love this keyboard - certainly worth the money."
4,bluetooth is the way to go,"The keyboard has a good feel and is compact. It works with my Nokia 770 but it is clearly made for PDAs and cell phones. I rarely use the stand which offers two sitting angles for my Nokia, opting to put the keyboard at a comfortable distance for typing but bringing the screen closer to see. This is made possible by bluetooth (powered by 2 AAAs). Simulating number keys is a bit of a pain but perhaps a required tradeoff for its sleek design. Overall, I happy with keyboard but I would be happier to have a little bit better integration with the Nokia 770."
4,good...but...,"this is good for my umpc, however, if you need to use basic Chinese type, you may consider it's not convenient cuz you need use combination method to input numbers."
3,Good function,"This keyboard is very good, it has some great macros that make it easy to use on PPC. (I am using it with a Dell Axim X51)It is a bit larger than I had expected. Closed it measures 5.5"" X 4"" X .5""And the other problem I had with it was the closing mechinism broke 2 days after I got it.Overall, it is great. I would recomend, if you plan on doing a lot of typing."
4,Works great but can be tough to get connected,"This keyboard is compact, has a good feel for a portable, and is extremely easy to set up and connect IF you don't use a secure connection. The problem is that if you use it in a public place, not using a secure connection is just asking for a virus.It often takes 4 or 5 attempts to make a secure connection using a simple 2 digit password. That's annoying but necessary since I only use the keyboard in public places.If you don't mind an unsecure connection it quickly connects the first time, every time.Once it makes the connection, either secure or unsecure, it holds it. I've never had it drop the connection and I can touch type on it nearly as fast as a standard computer keyboard.If it was easier to make a secure connection I would have rated this keyboard 5 stars."
2,overpriced and flimsy,"don't bother... during the 2007 holidays, these keyboards were going for less than US$30, but immediately doubled in price... what you get is a flimsy arrangement that, albeit works, is not the quality one would expect for the inflated US$60+ price (other bluetooth keyboards are equally overpriced)...do yourself a favor and get an Apple wireless keyboard - you'll be purchasing a quality product and a work of art at the same price..."
2,Think Outside Stowaway Bluetooth Keyboard for PDA,"Don't do it... I recently purchased a bluetooth keyboard from Think Outside and am thoroughly disappointed. The keyboard itself is a reasonable size, although it does lack the top number row. My primary complaint is the keyboard very frequently drops keystrokes and, more importantly, drops the bluetooth connection. With the latter, you have to go through the pairing process."
2,"Great Item, Complete with the Most Annoying Sticker of All Time!","I just received this item from Amazon, and it is very nice, with the exception of one thing...someone in product development thought it would be a great idea to put an industrial strength sticker over the keyboard and exterior of the item. It took me over a hour to manually remove the sticker, and it still has residue all over 9 buttons on the right side. Plus, when trying to get the residue off of the case with some goo gone, it removed the IGo logo, thus ruining the front of the case.For $90, I would have thought someone could have spec'd out a removable sticker, or better yet, no sticker at all, simply a card/placard that would show how to open it. This is terrible, and I'm totally dissatisfied that my brand new $90 item is ruined thanks to someone's poor planning."
1,PalmOS support dire,"This keyboard looks and feels great. It works on the Palm as it states, but unfortunately the palm keyboard driver is a buggy piece of rubbish. Anyone that reviews this for the palm and says its great obviously hasnt actually tried typing anything that requires the use of the shift key. Theres a bug that means that anything you shift causes the next letter to be shifted as well. Intensely annoying. And thinkoutsides reply? Wait for 1.5 years for the new driver. Well thanks but no, I'll be binning my keyboard instead.Before you buy this for a palm check out the support forums at ThinkOutside.com - look at all the people complaining about this problem and the lack of response from thinkoutside...."
1,Buyer Beware,"Never would I write a review of anything: I don't have the time. But if you just get totally ripped off by a company who nonchalantly responds "". . .this item has been discontinued, we don't support it anymore. . ."" when it was JUST purchased off of Amazon. Not only did iGo not give a D about selling someone a product that didn't work, AND was no longer supported. . the customer service was basically: ""Tough."" Stay away from this and all iGo products: the actual physical equipment that you see before you in these pictures could be made as a high school metal shop project. buyer beware!"
4,Compact and powerful...,"The iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard is truly portable. Running on two AA batteries, you can easily carry spares around. Only gripe about this product is that it lacks a dedicated number row (for 1 to 0). Else, it would be perfect."
4,Not bad at all,"I finally got around to connecting my keyboard to my IPAQ Rx5915. As mentioned by nearly everyone, I had to download new drivers to get it to work. Then I had no problems.An Amazon reviewer mentioned that the keyboard has an unpleasant wobble and rattle when typing near the ends because the ends are not supported. He had made a cardboard support when fixed the problem. I was looking for this note (didn't find it) to see what refinements he'd made. In experimenting, I discovered that by placing cardboard under the PC stand to raise it up a little, it ended the rattle and most of the wobble. I haven't figure out how to attach the cardboard so I don't accidentally leave it somewhere, but I guess it's replacable.The keyboard seems stable enough in my lap, and I found that if I detach the pc stand, it supports the PC while I have the kb in my lap.Anyway, it's not perfect, but it's way better than using a thumb keyboard, or worse, the on screen keyboard with a stylus."
1,defective Bluetooth Stowaway Keyboard,"The Stowaway Bluetooth Keyboard came in the original unopened package. However when I opened it, there was a sticker across the keyboard from I to M that was difficult to unstick. When I got that off, and tried to pair it to my PDA, I found that the enter key did not work. So I sent it back. I received it about Aug. 15 and returned it the next day. It has been almost a month and I have not heard from the Uttam Kumar, theiGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard for Blackberry and other PDA/ Handheldsseller."
1,a WASTE if your not careful !,"I bought this keyboard for my Garmin iQue M5 PDA, I saw the of the product ""UNIVERSAL bluetooth keyboard"" only find out that it is NOT universal ! it doesn't work with my PDA, I must say that customer service is terrible ! they replied after 4 days, only to say ""its not compatible"", in the forum the moderators wouldn't say if they'r gonna develop an update for this problem. I am sure this keyboard has alot of potential, but you really need to be certain that its compatible.. by the way it doesn't work with the new Nokia 6680 too."
4,Works on Verizon XV6800 with Windows Mobile 6,"Bought this keyboard at a price low enough I was willing to take the chance for something that isn't officially supported.I downloaded the driver for the XV6700 and almost everything works as its suppose too. The exception(s) are the secondary 'blue' functions (shortcuts) don't seem to work. For example the ""J"" key has additional functions (almost all keys do) by pressing the blue ""Fn"" button, they are ""Notes"" and ""Apps."" On my PDA/phone the second shortcut function ""apps"" doesn't work, I only ever get the ""notes"" shortcut. For me this is only a minor issue that by itself wouldn't rate the one star reduction.The reason for the keyboard only getting four stars is the lack of a dedicated number row of keys.Overall worth the extreme deal Amazon had between Christmas and New Years."
1,not compatible to N95,"According to the information provided on reviews from Amazon this device has problems of compatibility with a lot of devices, the box says that is compatible with more than 5 hundred (pda's, smartphones) bad luck the N95 is not compatible with it. SO PLEASE STOP SAYING THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH SYMBIAN, it would be compatible if it is compatible with ALL devices that use that OS. It is a shame because the hardware seems strong and well made, and is cheaper than the NOKIA one"
1,Does not work with Palm Treo 700p!,"FYI: For those who are purchasing this product for your Palm Treo 700p, don't! I was informed by Igo's (un)customer service that this product has been found to be incompatible with the Treo 700p. Be warned!"
2,iGo Stowaway Keyboard,The keyboard appears to be of average quality but does not work with Windows Mobile 6 at the current time. I hope Mobility releases a driver in the near future!
1,"Extremely dangerous device, broke my Treo 650","The driver for this device completely broke my Treo 650, fortunately I have Sprint's insurance plan so I was able to get a replacement Treo. I used the latest driver from the Thinkoutside website. If you have a Treo do not get this device."
3,discontinued product,"Good product, just not supported anymore (i.e.: no more driver developed, as far as I know no support prior pocket pc 2003 and after windows mobile 5). Be aware."
2,Doesn't work with all blackberry's,"I have not had a chance to test this product yet because it does not work with my Blackberry (7130e). The text is a little deceiving because it says that it works with Blackberry's. After getting the product and trying for hours and reading the literature, I called the support line and I was told that it does not work with my Blackberry. I was disappointed by the fact that none of the literature tells you what devices it works with."
2,Shop around first if this if for your Blackberry,"Not a bad product but it doesn't work for my BB 8700c even though the maker's web site says it does. The problem I have is that my BB is on BES and using this keyboard requires security changes that are administered by the BES administrator. If you are not very technical or if you use BES, I suggest you look for another product.On the bright side, I did get this to work with my PS3. Not all of the keys work on it, though."
4,Good,This is a good book especially for college students. It is informative and interesting. It accurately states the correct information about interviewing in Social Work.
5,POKER BIBLE,"This book is a masterpiece. It is an all encompassing book providing information on many different types of card games. The best portion of the book is about no-limit texas hold em' and the secrets Doyle Brunson reveals. When it comes to poker instruction, there is no substitute for Super System."
4,This is the first poker book I have read.,The wording and terms used are a little outdated but the content is still excellent reading. It's a very aggressive style of play that is suggested in the book which is a little too aggressive for me. However it has given me an insight on how to play against people more aggressive than me.Good first book on hold'em.
4,"Dated, but...","The No Limit Holdem section, the only part written by Brunson, is excellent. I wasn't impressed by the other sections. They applied to games which are not widely played today (5 draw with a joker, 7 hi-lo without a qualifier or declare, razz, 2 to 7 lowball). I didn't care for the limit holdem section either.But Brunson's concepts changed me from a tight, predictable player into a much more dangerous animal. If you play NL tournaments, you'll find this book money well spent."
3,"Out of date, but interesting from a historical perspective","If you are looking for a quick way to improve your poker skills, this book is not for you. It is not in any hurry to give you a valuable advice on every page and the advice you do get is outdated. You will probably learn more from any good modern book, and it also will be shorter by a factor of three or more.Still, it is a great (and very thorough) look at poker the way it was 20 years ago, before poker literature really made its impact on the game. If you are a true poker aficionado, you might want to check it out."
2,Little Out-Dated,"I read Super-System then went to apply it in modern day poker...and it doesnt work that well. Please keep in mind the Texas Dolly won these tournaments in 77'78...a long, long time ago. Most of these stratigies are no longer helpful, and his philsophy is bet>bet>bet>, a tight aggressive player can pick up on this in no time and have you wondering where your money went to. the texas dolly hasnt done so well in recent tournaments because, his stratigie is out-dated and easy to read. Although there are some helpful tips in this book, i would not recommend this book #1.."
4,"""Don't quit the day job""","""Don't quit the day job"", as Doyle Brunson said recently in an interview.I bought this book some time ago and enjoyed it thoroughly. It is a must read for poker buffs who are looking for ways to upgrade their game. It is important to realize that even Doyle changes up his game from time to time, and cannot be relied upon to predictably do what he recommends here.Much of what Doyle recommends has value. Pay attention to his comments about what strategy works for which stakes. The author covers many types of poker games by using expert commentary on how to play them effectively by such players as the late, great Chip Reese. In the back of the book is an extensive section about the odds of drawing to particular combinations of cards to make various hands. This is good stuff.Brunson suggests that reading about playing poker is all to the good, but that to really learn about it you have to find a game for the kind of stakes you like and do it.Good Luck,Robert Hardy"
3,Not for Friday night boozing with your buddies,"This is nice reading but if you are interested in learning some strategies for you poker game against you buddies on Friday night, this isn't for you. If you are going to be playing in tourneys against strong players, then read it. He has some unique strategies which will steal you some pots."
3,Super System isn't so super,"Not that impressed with the book. I felt others are better. Nice thing about this book however, is it covers more games than just holdem. It is more about theory than nitty gritty details (like what starting hands to begin with) Covers alot of reading your opponent, but Caro's book is better. I found it OK, not stellar, but OK. I wouldn't recommend this as your only poker book - but as a secondary book it is acceptable."
4,A MUST READ,"""super System"" is a must read for all serious poker players at all skill levels. I greatly enjoyed the depth of strategy and insights into other player's hands."
2,outdated,"Yeah, the section on no-limit hold-em still has some value (although so many books published since, cover the same ground). All the other material in the book is fun, but just about worthless in the modern game of poker. Get a more updated poker book, there are zillions on them. Many of which cover the same material, but little nuggets of useful info can be gathered from each and help you evolve into a solid complete player. In other words, buy several poker books. There is no ""one"" poker bible as some say there is."
5,This is the only book you need,"This is the book, you do not need to buy anything else. It was written 25 years ago but your game is going to change forever. I bougth some others books like Ken Warren Teaches Texas Hold'em and Hold'Em Poker for Advanced Players but I think I wasted my money. The part about Texas Hold'em is brillant but all book is very well written."
4,Middle son's request,My middle son is a poker buff. He has several books now on how to play the game. This is the one he wanted for Christmas. I don't play or understand the game myself so I could not rate this book properly.
3,"Money maker for ""Texas Dolly""","Well I guess all serious poker players must read this book. I love ""Texas Dolly"" but his chapter on ""no limit"" really messed up my game. Very few people can play like he suggests. He did sell over 300K of the books at $100 when it first came out. I'm sure many more have been sold now that poker has become so popular. I think he has made much more $ on the two books than he ever made playing poker. Better books about ""no limit"" poker are Dan Harringtons books (2) and T.J. Cloutiers ""No Limit & Pot Limit Hold'EM"" just to name a few. ""Stone Cold"" by Pete Hautman"" 1952 is a haunting story of a young poker player I really enjoyed reading."
4,Excellent,this book was very good. I learned a lot about poker and how to win. its a mentalitly and a skill...doyle possesses both of these fine qualities.
4,Hubby loved the book,Bought this for my hubby for Christmas and he lived it. Found it extremely helpful. Would recommend to anyone trying to up their game
4,Enjoyable and informative,Enjoyable and informative book. Good look into one of the legends of the poker world and of the old days of the gambler. Lots of tips and plans on how to better your game. Will surly check out his other books....
2,Book binding,"I am aware of the methods for correctly handling books; yet, the back on this one broke the first time I opened it. The binding is substandard; the book is great!"
1,waste of time & money all common knowledge 672 pages??,"All common knowledge. First 100 plus pages is a bio. Who cares. Then teaches about position. (common knowl.)Out of 672 pages maybe ten pages worth looking at. Waste of money. Few tips no tricks couple from Caro, but thats it. Brunson plays any cards at any time. No method to the madness constantly goes all in. I personally learned little. My book is on ebay."
5,"Only read a few pages, already worth the money","From what I have surmised, this is the poker book to get if you get only one. And after reading only a small portion I can see why. I have already learned a good deal. Doyle does a good job telling you what he would do and why it is the right thing to do. That way you can comprehend and not just mimic. He covers more than just hold 'em, unlike many poker books. He covers many games and in great detail. I think this is a good choice for anyone that wants to improve their poker skills, and not just jump on the hold 'em bandwagon."
3,power poker,In my opinion its more for the advanced player. A must read though for anyone interested in improving their game.
2,Disappointed,"While I have watched Doyle on TV and have a huge amount of respect for his game, I was disappointed with this new (old) book.I was hoping for increase my return with my online game and the weekly game with the boys. No such luck! I wish Doyle & co would get to their point instead of using 5 pages to waffle on. Very long winded.There are defintely better books for the beginner/intermediate player which talk about pot odds and cover the same strategies."
4,The Bible of Poker,"I found this book very helpful in understanding poker at a higher level. I wouldn't suggest this book for a beginner, but for someone that have played a few hands at poker and know the basic knowledge of poker. Doyle Brunson and his team cover about every form of poker out there in this book and I would recommend this book to anybody that plans on playing some serious poker and making money at it."
1,Luv you Doyle but not this book!,"Very aggressive style of Hold Em, some may argue reckless. Everybody is playing this way so one needs to do the opposite and play tight. Doyle says sometimes even if I just have a bit of the flop I raise, if I lose then that's Poker....you have to gamble...ect... Too wreckless for my taste. This book cost me to get called with the 2nd best hand much too often! If you don't like it..well that's poker folks!"
4,A bit dated but required reading nonetheless,"A great book by a poker great. The first book that I read that spoke to the game being more about people and position rather than cards. Interesting anecdotes, colorful history and a guide to aggressive playing make this a vital part of any serious players arsenal.That being said, realize that it was written in the late 70's and does not take into account the internet phenomenon and the super aggressive players it has spawned. However, if you can keep the material in historical perspective, it is an invaluable resource. 4.5/5"
4,Good Book-Extremely Outdated,"At the time of its publication it was a cutting edge book which was the best of its time. I believe Doyle Brunson is an extremely talented poker, however for today's player I feel that the book is of little use to the serious player. The information it contains is usefull, now just more commonly known. The reason for its importance at the time of its publication was the many charts showing statistics which had not before been this well organized. Nowadays all of these charts are available on the internet and easily accessable. I think it is worth reading only for the history behind it. As far as learning from it I feel you can find all of the usefull information on the internet. Read it only for the history and incite of one of poker's best."
1,Outdated,"I ordered this book hoping i could become a better poker player but super system is way too outdated and most of the material is about games that arent played anymore. The NLHE section is general poker strategy by todays standards, i understand that super system was a great poker book when it first came out but now there r so many better poker books out there. Unless your a beginner poker player or would just want to read basically a poker history book, i wouldt suggest this book."
4,"Brilliant, but not a system","I bought the Super System with my very first poker earnings. I was doing fairly well for myself, but I realized that there I wasn't very knowlegeable and that I had no method or approach to poker, and hold'em in specific.I read the hold'em section of the Super System several times. It helped me immensely and improved my game (and my winnings.) The Super System, however, is not a system. It is a variety of loosely connected thoughts, observations, plays, advice, and reminiscences. Doyle Brunson gives you all the knowledge he accrued over years of poker in a few hundred pages, but it is written and organized poorly.The statistics and advice are immensely helpful. If you read through the book and collate all that he says, you could use his advice to make a very good system yourself. Just don't expect too much from the book on the first reading."
3,Covers many different types of poker games.,"It was already mentioned below, but I wanted to reiterate that this book covers many different poker games. The most popular is right now is Texas Holdem and covers approx. 100 pages on the topic. Just wanted to throw that out there in case you didn't know."
5,THE Poker Bible,There is really not much to say other that this is by far the best book on Poker written. Even though it was written in the seventees it hasn't lost any of its value. A must-read for any poker play who wants to make money in the game.
1,KIT caution. Mine doesn't work.,"I can't recommend. As their are other none kits for less money. Your taking a chance that electrical components, like diodes, capacitors, etc. are good. As their is no way they check each individual small part. After 2 hours of assembly, the voltage output is wrong. It constantly climbs. I turned it off at 30+ volts, The polarity was backward? and the LED doesn't light. Checked everything several times, with the detailed instructions. So I can't recommend it."
5,"Create a heathly, safe home for yourself and your family","This book helps you take better care of yourself and your love ones. We are concerned about what we eat and if it's safe. We also need to be concerned about what we use to clean our homes with and what we use on our skin. In this book there is lots of good, practical receipes for a toxin-free home. This book will be on that I will use often."
1,Horrible Camera,"I purchased this product in August of 2003 and have had problems ever since. I returned it within a week because of the battery life. The second one was returned because the battery compartment broke. The third one was returned because of an internal lens problem and it took horrible night pictures. And now the fourth camera is being returned for the same problem as the third. Hewlett-Packard will not give me my money back, they will just keep sending me replacements, they will not give me a free upgrade, and they will not extend their warranty. I do not recommend this product to anyone unless they have money to throw away."
2,don't get it!!!!,"Don't waste the money on this camera. Pictures are great but the baterrie life is terrible...At first I didn't mind replacing the batteries because I got the rechargeable pack but things haven't changed!!! I called HP on this problem the gentalman on the phone didn't understand the problem, he told me to use photo lithium batteries I bought a pair hoping this would cure the problem but nope same old batterie sucker!!!!"
1,No Batteries,This is a terrible camera. It run out of batteries with less than 10 pictures. It should be recalled. Is a very bad product.
1,HP 735,The photos were extremely blurry and only took good pictures of closeups the digital zoom is useless for photos.Battery don't last more that about 10 pictures.Kodak DC210 1 mega pixell takes much better photos.Taking mine back after one day of poor pictures.
4,"use it right, it does the job","This was my first digital camera and it's because of this camera that I stuck with HP when upgrading. It's a very good point and shoot camera with enough modes and settings to satisfy those who like fiddling with such things.Many of the reviews here complain about battery life. Turn off the live display, you don't need it anyway since the viewfinder is accurate. I never got *fewer* than 60 pictures (sometimes more) in two star mode with the live display off, on a pair of 1800 mAh rechargeables. I also had a big difference when I changed the auto shutoff to a shorter time period.Also, yes, you need a memory card -- but what digital camera doesn't? I had a 64 MB card with mine and only once completely used the card up.Shutter speed is a little slower than average for the class but fine for everything except action shots. Lens glass is by Pentax and is good quality. No, you won't get digital SLR quality from this camera, but at <$140 it's a great deal."
2,I lost pictures of my new son!,"This camera decided to quit on the day my son was born. We were in the hospital trying to take pics of my brand new baby, and the flash wouldn't go off. I'm guessing from these reviews it's because of a ""corrupted flash card"" because we cannot find any other explanation for it, since the camera otherwise works fine. The batteries were even fully charged! But, having no camera on the day my son was born is unforgiveable. I'll never buy an HP product again!"
1,horrible waste of money,You can literally take 8 shots and the camera is dead. I've missed so many photo opps. Definitely NOT worth buying.
1,This camera sucks,"I am totally dissatisfied with this camera.. I bought with lotz of expectations and found it a junk piece.For new buyer dont mind spending a few more dollors , go to Canon or Sony.. They are good.this camera as mentioned eats battries like anything.. not able to take > than 10 pic and has poor flash. .all photos are coming dark"
2,Not very Photosmart,"Okay.. well I bought this camera right before I headed off for a family vacation in Cuba. This was my first digital camera and was expecting to be able to capture every moment. Not. This camera eats your batteries like crazy. Dont expect to be able to take more than 7 or 8 pictures at a time. Not very convenient when your on the go. There is also around a 3 second delay from the time you click the button to the time your picture actually takes. Bummer. That being said though, I have always been more than satisfied with the quality of the pictures and it's very easy to use. To sum it up.. if your looking for a starter camera or you just want to take pictures once and while this camera is okay but I'd look into getting a Cannon or a Kodak Easy Share. Both very good, simple to use and are worth every penny."
4,No problem with batteries,Almost every reviewer has complained about short lifetime with alkaline batteries. This is because you are NOT suppoused to use these! It says so explicitly in the manual. If you get rechargable batteries the camera works for several days before you need to recharge.
2,Hope you have a lot of batteries in your pocket,"This camera would have been decent if it could actually operate for a reasonable amount of time on the two AA batteries it requires. Rechargeable or alkaline - doesn't matter - I get through about five -seven shots and it's shot. Not very practical. I've had this camera for about a year and a half. Many batteries and many missed shots later, I can definitely say the HP 735 was not worth the money I wasted on it. I should have coughed up the extra money to by a higher megapixel version of my original 1.5 megapixel Olympus Camedia Camera- now that was a digital camera worth owning."
2,Not very satisfied,"I've read the good and the bad reviews. I would not recommend this camera. Read on if you want to know why.The good things: price is acceptable for the feature set, picture quality good for the price. PC software a breeze to use.The bad things:- It takes about 2 seconds from the moment you press the button until the photo is actually taken.- battery life is questionable, especially if you use the LCD. I tried every single type of battery. Make sure you have one or two sets of spares with you. But beware! Be sure you cahnge the batteries before they run out, or you might get strange behaviors like corrupted flash card.-I found the camera very buggy (I might be unlucky). It damaged (to the point of not being able to reformat) a flash card when batteries got depleted. Also, in another instance, it corrupted my flash card. I had to reformat it.Definitely my next one will not be a HP."
1,Charging Flash problem camera is now totally worthless,"bought this camera off of a reputable dealer on ebay and when i received it and turned it on, it would not take any photos. The screen comes on but when you depress the shutter button you keep getting the same message ""charging flash"" no photos. I have tried several batteries and even had the camera plugged in via the power source and still had the same error. Calling HP help was totally useless. They had no answer for the problem they said it was new to them and then immediately refused to help once they heard i bought it form an ebay dealer"
3,not so bad,"that's right,i run out of batteries in a very short time.i bought lots of rechargable batteries,they are always in charge. so this solved my problem in a way.secondly when i saw my friends' cameras(like fuji) i ve been shocked.because their image quality was better.but then i learned their prices..really high!i think this is not a bad camera considering its price.."
2,discouraged,"I dont know if the cameras arent consistent or what.. My camera was horrible. Extremely slow from when I pushed the button to take the picture to the actual flash. I could take my hand off the camera and wait around 3 seconds before it would click and flash. Not good for quick photos of the kids! On the clearest pictures, they werent very focused. My batteries were used up completely in an hour of playing with my camera. Plus, you have to use the batteries to get the pictures to your computer. Im returning my camera and hoping to find something better for the same price."
1,Who would want this?,"This helmet is very poorly constructed, even for a ""novelty"" helmet. It is much smaller than a real XXL and _reeks_ of chemicals. The plastic trim aroung the lip of the helmet doesn't meet in the back and leaves an ugly gap of almost an inch. The biggest problem is that the straps are not riveted at the same point on both sides, making for a very sloppy look and uncomfortable feel. Don't waste your money on this one, you'll be disappointed."
4,"Pretty good, but too salty","The texture and taste are pretty good. But, if you are used to homemade bean soups, this is not nearly as good as something you could make from scratch. Plus, it is too salty as a previous reviewer complained! One small serving that has 140 calories has 700 mg of sodium."
5,Very Good Easy To Make Soup,"Highly recommend, especially if you like beans. This soup is delicious and can be made quickly. You can enjoy it as is, or you can add fresh or frozen vegetables. I made it both ways. I added 1/2 cup fresh sliced carrots and 1/4 cup celery at start. Alone it makes a thick soup. All my family really liked this soup. Plan to try all Nueva Cocina soups!"
1,206 pages of nothing,"On the backcover of this book, Cuban vice-dictator Raul Castro is quoted as saying: ""We have been able to make history but have been unable to write it."" Ostensibly, this compendium of interviews with Cuban generals is what passes for writing history in that country. Filled from beginning to end with gobbledygook such as the inferiority of ""bourgeois armies,"" the results of these shallow interviews are devoid of any significant content. I would have loved asking these generals about the incongruity of fighting for ""liberation"" on foreign lands while enduring the 42-year-old rule of Fidel Castro in their native land without the benefit of a simple plebiscite."
3,It's ok,"My cat absolutely loves this brush. The bad thing is that it doesn't last long. The bristles start to bend making it harder to replace the plate after removing the hair. The handle contains the battery, but the cover for the battery became loose meaning that I had to squeeze while I brushed in order for it to work. I eventually had to tape the cover on because it would just slide right off. The entire brush section is removable, but it also becomes loose, so that I will be brushing my cat and the end will fall off. It just stopped working completely. I'm considering looking for another one simply because he loves it so much (the reason it got 3 stars), however it has turned out to be such a hassle, that I'm considering just getting a regular brush for him."
5,2ND CD!!!,"This is my 2nd copy of this disc. I loaned the first one out and never got it back, so I definitely had to order another one...I'm not loaning this one to ANYONE!! If you are a true lover of good jazz piano, tight beats and hot bass lines, BUY THIS DISC!!! If you can get past ""Seize The Moment"", ""Reminiscing"" and ""Hot Potatoe"", this is an awesome disc! Where are these cats now?"
2,Ridiculously Redundant,"While I applaud Zane's attempt at ""shattering the myth"" I found the book to be banal drivel at best. Each tale had the same voice from the same kind of woman who enjoyed the same types of sexual acts. Perhaps Zane could give her characters more depth and interesting characteristics so that their sexcapades become a triumph, rather than smut. I wanted to like her characters personally and enjoy their experiences; instead I was bogged down with repetitive rhetoric of repugnance. Zane, try again, or give it up. Or maybe I'll give it a whirl..."
